Jacobs was born in 1917 in Gordon, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales. He was educated at Knox Grammar School, and later studied at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1938. During World War II, from 1940 to 1945, Jacobs served in the Second Australian Imperial Force. He enlisted in Paddington in 1939, and remained in the service until 1948. Following his return from the war, Jacobs returned to the University of Sydney where he completed a Bachelor of Laws degree, winning the university's Medal for Law in 1946, and graduating in 1947. Later that year, Jacobs was admitted to the New South Wales Bar Association, where he practised as a barrister, and in 1958 he was made a Queen's Counsel. In 1960 Jacobs was appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In 1963, Jacobs was selected to serve a three-year term in Cyprus as the neutral presiding judge of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus, which was to be established following attempts to establish a constitution. However, following a period of civil unrest on 21 and 22 December 1963, the constitutional arrangements collapsed, and the court was never created. In 1966 Jacobs was elevated to the Court of Appeal of New South Wales. From 1972, Jacobs was President of the NSW Court of Appeal. Jacobs was appointed to the bench of the High Court on 8 February 1974. He was selected by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Attorney-General Lionel Murphy, and was thus the first High Court Justice to be appointed by a Labor government since William Webb in 1946. Murphy, who was himself appointed to the High Court the following year, praised Jacobs for humanitarianism and his excellent legal scholarship. Jacobs was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1976. He retired from the High Court on 6 April 1979. On 19 July 1979, Jacobs was granted life membership of the New South Wales Bar.

He was the author of several army manuals on duties and customs eventually adopted by the U.S. military. Early life and career Born in Ispringen, Baden, Germany, Kautz immigrated with his parents to Brown County, Ohio in 1832. He later enlisted as a Private in the 1st Ohio Infantry, serving in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War from 1846 to 1847. Entering the United States Military Academy following the war, Kautz graduated in the class of 1852. He primarily served at Fort Steilacoom in the Pacific Northwest, where he was wounded twice with the 4th U.S. Infantry during Rogue River Wars with Indians along the Rogue River in 1855, and also served in the Puget Sound War in 1856. He was rewarded with a commission as a lieutenant in the regular army. On July 16, 1857, Kautz made what is sometimes credited as the first ascent of Mount Rainier. Kautz is reported as having climbed to the edge of Rainier's crater rim, but as he did not make the final walk to Rainier's Columbia Crest, his ascent has often been described as incomplete. During his time in the Pacific Northwest, Kautz became a supporter of Chief Leschi, who was executed in 1858. Kautz believed the execution was illegal and that Leschi should have been considered a prisoner of war. Shortly before Leschi's execution, Kautz published two issues of a newspaper defending him. The newspaper was called the Truth Teller, and its masthead stated: \\"Devoted to the Dissemination of Truth and the Suppression of Humbug.\\" From 1859 to 1860, he traveled in Europe. In August 1860, under Major George A. H. Blake's command, he traveled with recruits on a march from Fort Benton to Fort Vancouver, commanding a detachment of 150 recruits, which broke off from the main group at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho to begin service at Colville Depot, Washington Territory.Fort Colville Military Log and Correspondence microfilms from NARA viewed at Colville Public Library He returned to the Eastern United States in April 1861, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities between the Union and Confederacy. Civil War Kautz was a captain with the 6th U.S. Cavalry during the Peninsula Campaign from April to July 1862. Transferred to the Western Theater, Kautz later assisted in operations as a colonel with the 2nd Ohio Cavalry against Confederate General John Hunt Morgan's raid behind Union lines in Indiana and Ohio during June‚ÄìJuly 1863 and under the command of Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside at the Battle of Knoxville from September to December 1863. Promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on April 16, 1864, Kautz led cavalry operations under the command of Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler during Ulysses S. Grant's campaigns against Richmond and Petersburg between April and June 1864. His cavalry division was a part of the Army of the James and was forced to withdraw from its position at White's Tavern following an attack by parts of Confederate Lt. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's Corps. On December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Kautz for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from October 28, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.Eicher, John H., and David J.

He was active during the Union pursuit of Robert E. Lee from April 2 to April 9, 1865, until Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. After the Civil war After the war, Kautz served (from May to June 1865) on the trial board investigating the conspirators involved in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, before performing extensive service in the southwest frontier, including as the commander of the Department of Arizona and commanding officer of Fort McDowell. He was appointed commander of the Department of the Columbia in July 1891 with the rank of brigadier general. After leaving military service in 1892, he lived in retirement until his death at Seattle, Washington. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Bastard and Paul Lifeless. Formation The band first formed under the assumed name of Graves and recorded a demo in 2002 which was essentially composed of re-recorded Graves songs with a heavier musical element. In 2003, the group went on to change its name to Gotham Road and recorded the Seasons of the Witch EP which contained five new songs as well as two reworked Graves songs. Gotham Road went on tour, \\"Seasons of the Witch Tour\\" , to support the EP in 2003. The following year they recorded a three-song demo and thus departed on their sixty city \\"Mourning Light Tour\\", during which the band was denied entry to Canada and had to cancel subsequent shows. The band had also booked a European tour which they had to cancel due to venues backing out according to Graves due to his outspoken Conservative punk views. The band would go on to play numerous shows and, in December 2004, played a farewell show before Michale Graves' departure for the Marines. Graves was then approached by Horror High Records to record a solo album, the subsequent album Punk Rock Is Dead featured Paul Lifeless on drums. He was later honorably discharged from the Marines due to a back injury, and embarked on a tour to promote his new album that featured the members of Gotham Road as his backing band as well as openers Trashlight Vision. Few one-off Gotham Road shows followed. Hiatus The band has, as of late, been on indefinite hiatus as each of the members have all gone on to different projects. Michale has continued on with his solo efforts, taking JV Bastard along as a touring bassist for his solo band; Paul Lifeless went on to work with Know Your Enemy and currently Mister Monster as well as The Banner; Loki and JV Bastard recently formed The Doomsday Prophecy, a metal band which has been developing a cult following in the New York/New Jersey area. Reunion On April 12, 2008, Gotham Rd. reunited for one show in Belmar, New Jersey. The band also re-released their CD Seasons of the Witch through MP3 download, replete with 8 bonus tracks. The band also contributed two songs to the German compilation Get acquainted Vol. 1. The latest word is that due to Paul's obligation to his successful hardcore band The Banner he will not rejoin the band in the immediate future. Paul currently plays in the punk/surf band, Killed by the Bull from North Jersey which also features ex- members of the Banner as well as Captives and Distance. On December 31, 2009, Gotham Rd. played a show at Dingbatz and then again on January 4, 2014 as part of a benefit show for a friend of the bands.

(Italian Post) is the Italian postal service provider. Besides providing postal services, Gruppo Poste Italiane offers integrated communication, postal savings products, logistics, financial and insurance services throughout Italy. History =1862‚Äì1990= Law no. 604 of 5 May 1862, (the so-called Postal reform), created a national and centralised organisation for postal service by introducing a unique general fee to pay for services, postal stamps, throughout the entire territory of the newly formed kingdom of Italy. Subsequently, with Royal Decree 5973 of 10 March 1889, the Directorate General of Posts and Telegraphs was separated from the Ministry of Public Works and thus turned into the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. It was commissioned to create a network of offices in Italy to forward and receive mail and telegrams, make and receive telephone calls, carry out financial transactions and manage assets. It also worked as branch offices for the nascent electric services for a time. The giro service, (commonly known as BancoPosta since 2000), was founded in 1917. In 1924, during the Fascist period, the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs was renamed Ministry of Communications becoming an important centre of power. The services network was expanded with the acquisition and implementation of new logistics facilities. New buildings in Functionalist style were built in the major cities. With the development of telephony and radio communications, the Ministry incorporated the State Company for Telephone Services (ASST) and the nascent EIAR (which would later become RAI and run both public radio and television). =1990‚Äì2000= In the early 1990s, the Italian public administration and postal service were deemed irrecoverable in terms of efficiency and profitability. The budget deficit increased personnel costs, which in 1986 absorbed about 93% (including 16% for pensions) of the current revenue. From 1970 to 1985 employees‚Äô productivity was reduced by 24% at the expense of the quality of services provided, generating an ever more critical deficit situation. In 1994, in (Germany), the regular average of delivered daily mail after dispatch was almost 80%, while in Italy the comparable statistic was less than 20%. In 1989, the average time for mail delivery was 8.5 days. An attempt was made to contain the obvious gap in the quality of Italian postal service compared to the rest of Europe, with Decree-Law no. 487 of 1 December 1993, converted by law no. 71 of 29 January 1994. This led to the transformation of the Italian Post Office from an independent company into a public business, with the additional step to SpA being taken in 1996 (implemented after 28 February 1998. The transformation process required the management of the Italian Post Office to adopt the production efficiency principle, recover the quality of services and bring about economic and financial recovery. This led to the gradual reduction of the 4,500 billion lira deficit, in 1993, through specific policies to reduce production costs (80% due to staff costs), by increasing revenues from the sale of services to the PA and by reordering the tariff system, thus achieving a net profit by 2001. In February 1998, the Ministry of the Treasury (The Prodi I Cabinet) appointed Corrado Passera, as the CEO of the newly formed Italian Poste SpA. The business plan implemented by Corrado Passera from 1998 to 2002 cut staff by 22,000 units. On the other hand, according to some trade union leaders, there was a casualization of contracts for new recruits, cases of widespread harassment and resignation because of workload due to the excess staff cuts. The Solidarity Fund was used for saving on labour costs as well as lowering the average age of the staff. The last two years of missing contributions from employees taking early retirement were paid for by a deduction in payroll for the new employees for 10 years. The company offsets these losses replacing them by recruiting many young workers under the age of under 24 and giving them three-year apprenticeship contracts. =2000‚Äì2010= In 2000, the Italian Post Office, through its subsidiary SDA Express Courier, acquired 20% of the share capital of the Bartolini company and officially formed the Consortium Logistics and Parcels with the three major companies for the sorting of parcels in the country. This agreement was also the subject of a challenge by the rival companies in court, but it ended in favour of the Consortium. Poste Italiane has also adopted a control system for monitoring in real time all the post offices, the logistics network and the security of digital communications and transactions working with the Italian government, international agencies, universities and research centres. The importance of financial products and services, such as the Postepay prepaid card, has been increasing in the last few years. Postepay, first introduced in 2003, achieved great success, especially among young people, gaining and maintaining first position at European level in pre-paid cards sector. =2010‚Äìpresent= In 2011, Poste Italiane acquired UniCredit MedioCredito Centrale for ‚Ç¨136 million. On 16 May 2014, the Italian government approved the stakes sale of up to 40 percent in Poste Italiane. The company was forced to close 455 offices in 2015 due to low profit according to the Poste Italiane Spa CEO Francesco Caio‚Äôs decision. Today, as underlined by CEO Matteo Del Fante in November 2018, the company‚Äôs intention is to preserve post offices and take specific measures for smaller Italian cities[4]. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy), which now owns 64.696% of Poste Italiane Spa, sold about 35% of shares on Borsa Italiana. On 25 May 2016, a further 35% stake was transferred from the ministry to Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), making it the minority shareholder of the national investment bank. This has given it equity in stakes for Poste Italiane, but has also diluted its voting rights in CDP. Financial services One of the main business of the company is BancoPosta, a division within Poste Italiane SpA, which acts as a distribution platform providing postal savings services. The bank division, known as BancoPosta ring-fenced capital reserve, (BancoPosta FRC) in the balance sheet, had total assets of ‚Ç¨56,969,835,924 as at 31 December 2014. If BancoPosta was a separate company, it would see the bank ranked as the 10th largest bank by total assets. Cariparma, which ranked as the 10th in the survey by Ricerche e Studi (a subsidiary of Mediobanca), had total assets of ‚Ç¨50,296,831,000 as at 31 December 2014, despite the fact that the list also omitted some banks before Cariparma. BancoPosta is mainly engaged in the management of the banking book, promotion and management of the postal savings instruments issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (bonds and savings books), transaction banking services (payments and collections), promotion and distribution, through its own distribution platform, of financial products issued by third parties or other group companies. As concerns asset management, BancoPosta Fondi SGR manages open-ended mutual investment funds, Eurozone sovereign bonds and corporate bonds.  Postal services  Mail delivery, logistics, parcels and express delivery, have always been a key part of Poste Italiane's identity and also includes Italy's Universal Postal Service. In 2018, Poste Italiane handled approximately 3 billion items of mail and 127 million parcels, In the Deliver 2022 Plan in 2018, the company launched the new Joint Delivery model, which has redesigned the service by introducing afternoon and weekend deliveries and focused on modernising the fleet, by making it more environmentally-friendly with the introduction of 345 fully electric, three-wheeled scooters, with greater load capacity to facilitate parcel delivery in cities and improve occupational safety. The evolution of e-commerce logistics has led to the creation of PuntoPoste, the new accessible network that complements the network of over 12,800 post offices, enabling the collection and return of online purchases and the sending of pre-franked or prepaid parcels. In 2018, 417 PuntoPoste points were already operating, and the network will be expanded to include 3,500 units in 2019.  Payments, mobile and digital services  Following the new opportunities created by the European Payment Services Directive (PSD2)[5], in force as of January 2018, Poste Italiane decided to bring together payment, mobile and digital services under a single unit. The new division takes over the mobile phone operations of PosteMobile[6] and continues to be a provider of digital services for the Public Sector as an Identity Provider through the PosteID digital identity service, accredited by the Public Digital Identity System (SPID). The Company is also a partner of PagoPA, the electronic payments system of the Public Sector.  Insurance  Poste Italiane operates in the insurance business through PosteVita and Poste Assicura, offering life and casualty insurance products. Poste Vita additionally offers investment and savings products through BancoPosta distribution platform.  Ethical Code  In April 2018, Poste Italiane defined its new Ethical Code, with a view to updating and extending the principles and rules of conduct to be followed in its relations with all of its stakeholders, with particular regard to its suppliers, partners, market, and shareholders.  Sustainability  In 2018 Poste Italiane defined a new sustainability strategy by adopting an ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) strategic plan consisting of objectives that concern integrity and transparency, staff development, support for the region and the country, customer experience, decarbonisation of buildings and logistics and sustainable finance. Poste Italiane has adhered to the Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) and the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) promoted by the United Nations for the dissemination of a sustainable culture in investment and insurance policies. The company also obtained the ISO 37001: 2016 certification for anti-corruption.  Small Municipalities  Since 2018, Poste Italiane has introduced a programme, in collaboration with the Mayors of Italy, to support small Italian municipalities by strengthening its presence in throughout the country, urban redevelopment and security measures in the areas adjacent to Post Offices. The initiative is part of the broader Environmental, Social and Governance strategic plan which aims to support the development of the country. Challenges faced by the international community Like many post offices globally, Poste Italiane does not sell stamps to international customers, but unlike in other countries, it does not furnish local Italian government offices with free stamps. Because the secured email system is only available to Italian Citizens, this means that in order for a person abroad to connect with Italian Government Offices, one must first purchase Italian stamps from a third-party, often at a markup https://www.facebook.com/groups/dualusitaliancitizenship/permalink/10158403438611250.

Its name is derived from the area's Shinall Mountain, but Deltic Timber Corporation (now PotlatchDeltic), a major early developer of the area, opted to alter the name to mimic French language as part of a strategy (known as foreign branding) to orient the residential and commercial development toward upper-class population segments. The main thoroughfare is Chenal Parkway, mostly a divided four-lane path chiefly connecting Highway 10 to west Little Rock's Financial Centre business district. Chenal Parkway's northwestern terminus is just north of Arkansas 10 at Highway 300, near the Pinnacle Valley neighborhood. The southeastern terminus lies at Autumn Road at a transition to Financial Centre Parkway, with continuation to a conversion into Interstate 630 at Shackleford Road. Chenal Valley is known for its rapid development since 1990, when Chenal Country Club was established and some of the earliest of the area's current crop of homes were built. Those and other residences, including a limited number of apartment and condominium complexes, can be found scattered throughout a part of Little Rock that has for now retained much of its pre- development wooded areas. Several mass-market retailers populate Chenal's eastern commercial corridor near the Financial Centre area, including industry leaders Wal-Mart, Kroger, Target, Home Depot and even automobile manufacturers, such as Chevrolet.

With an adult size of about a cubic centimeter (1 cm3), they are both the smallest and one of the most venomous jellyfish in the world. They inhabit the northern marine waters of Australia. They are able to fire their stingers into their victim, causing symptoms collectively known as Irukandji syndrome. There are about 16 known species of Irukandji, of which Carukia barnesi, Malo kingi, Malo maxima, Malo filipina and Malo bella are the best-known.Crew, Becky, \\"The Smallest and Deadliest Kingslayer in the World,\\" October 7, 2013, Scientific American blog, retrieved Nov. 6, 2016 The symptoms of Irukandji syndrome were first documented by Hugo Flecker in 1952. They were named after the Irukandji people, whose country stretches along the coastal strip north of Cairns, Queensland. The first of these jellyfish, Carukia barnesi, was identified in 1964 by Jack Barnes; to prove it was the cause of Irukandji syndrome, he captured the tiny jellyfish and allowed it to sting him, his nine-year-old son and a robust young lifeguard. They all became seriously ill, but survived. Australian toxinologist Jamie Seymour made a documentary about the jellyfish called 'Killer Jellyfish'. In 2015, North Queensland researchers discovered evidence that Irukandji jellyfish actively hunt prey. Range The Irukandji jellyfish exists in the northern waters of Australia. The southern extent of the Irukandji's range on Australia's eastern coast has been gradually moving south. Biology A scale illustration of an Irukandji jellyfish and its tentacles. Below the jelly's medusa bell are two polyp forms of the species. Irukandji jellyfish are very small, with a bell about to wide (or wider) and four long tentacles, which range in length from just a few centimetres up to in length. Malo maxima mature irukandji typically have halo-like rings of tissue around their four tentacles. Apparently, it is the mature Irukandji that are highly venomous (in all species). Apparent Malo maxima juveniles have been identified without the halo-rings, and without gonads, and have demonstrated far weaker toxicity in stinging researchers. The stingers (nematocysts) are in clumps, appearing as rings of small red dots around the bell and along the tentacles. The Irukandji's small size and transparent body make it very difficult to see in the water. Very little is known about the life cycle and venom of Irukandji jellyfish. This is partly because they are very small and fragile, requiring special handling and containment. Their venom is very powerful. They were erroneously blamed for killing 5 tourists during a 3-month period in Australia. In fact, no evidence exists to suggest that any of the five victims displayed two universal features of Irukandji syndrome: delayed onset (5-40 min to illness and 2-12 hrs to death) and highly visible distress (vomiting, difficulty breathing, extreme pain, etc). Researchers conjecture that the venom possesses such potency to enable it to quickly stun its prey, which consists of small and fast fish. Judging from statistics, it is believed that the Irukandji syndrome may be produced by several species of jellyfish, but only Carukia barnesi and Malo kingi have so far been proven to cause the condition. Sting Unlike most jellyfish, which have stingers only on their tentacles, the Irukandji also has stingers on its bell. Biologists have yet to discover the purpose of this unique characteristic. The hypothesis is that the feature enables the jellyfish to be more likely to catch its prey of small fish. Irukandji jellyfish have the ability to fire stingers from the tips of their tentacles and inject venom.Killer Jellyfish, Oasis Irukandji jellyfish's stings are so severe they can cause fatal brain hemorrhages and on average send 50-100 people to the hospital annually.Predicting deadly Australian jellyfish movement, Australian Geographic, 13 May 2014 Robert Drewe describes the sting as \\"100 times as potent as that of a cobra and 1,000 times stronger than a tarantula's\\". Irukandji syndrome Irukandji syndrome is produced by a small amount of venom and induces excruciating muscle cramps in the arms and legs, severe pain in the back and kidneys, a burning sensation of the skin and face, headaches, nausea, restlessness, sweating, vomiting, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, and psychological phenomena such as the feeling of impending doom. The syndrome is in part caused by release of catecholamines. The venom contains a sodium channel modulator. The sting is moderately irritating; the severe syndrome is delayed for 5‚Äì120 minutes (30 minutes on average). The symptoms last from hours to weeks, and victims usually require hospitalisation. Contrary to belief, researchers from James Cook University and Cairns hospital in far north Queensland have found that vinegar promotes the discharge of jellyfish venom. \\"You can decrease the venom load in your victim by 50 per cent,\\" says Associate Professor Jamie Seymour from the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine at the university. \\"That's a big amount, and that's enough to make the difference, we think, between someone surviving and somebody dying.\\" However, other research indicates that while vinegar may increase the discharge from triggered stingers, it also prevents untriggered stingers from discharging; since the majority of stingers do not trigger immediately, the Australian Resuscitation Council continues to recommend using vinegar. Treatment is symptomatic, with antihistamines and anti-hypertensive drugs used to control inflammation and hypertension; intravenous opioids, such as morphine and fentanyl, are used to control the pain. Magnesium sulfate has been used to reduce pain and hypertension in Irukandji syndrome, although it has had no effect in other cases. Irukandji jellyfish are usually found near the coast, attracted by the warmer water, but blooms have been seen as far as five kilometres offshore. When properly treated, a single sting is normally not fatal, but two people in Australia are believed to have died from Irukandji stings in 2002 during a rash of incidents on Australia's northern coast attributed to these jellyfish‚Äîgreatly increasing public awareness of Irukandji syndrome. It is unknown how many other deaths from Irukandji syndrome have been wrongly attributed to other causes. It is also unknown which jellyfish species can cause Irukandji syndrome apart from Carukia barnesi and Malo kingi.

The Freestyle was the first sneaker designed (by Angel Martinez who was a co founder of Reebok ) and marketed for women. It helped Reebok into the mainstream athletic wear market and fashion scene along with becoming one of the most popular athletic shoes of all time. In 1984, the shoe accounted for more than half of Reebok sales. The Reebok Freestyle was popular during the 1980s aerobics craze and is still in production and remodeled through various collections and style variations. History Freestyle Hi advertisement of 1985 Released in 1982, the Reebok Freestyle was the first athletic shoe designed for women, even though it has also become fairly popular among males. Angel Martinez, one of Reebok's founders, and Steve Liggett, head of Reebok production, were instrumental developing the shoe. The shoe was made to accommodate aerobics workouts and was released during the height of the 1980s aerobics craze. Fitness Instructor Denise Austin was one first to promote the shoe by wearing them at a sport and fitness exposition in Los Angeles. Following the debut and success of the Freestyle, Reebok began sponsoring clinics and workout programs throughout the 1980s and '90s. The shoes could be seen on the trainers of Jane Fonda workout videos and classes, and the Step Reebok workout routine was released in 1989. By 1983, Reebok's sales were over $13 million, accounting for half of the company's total sales and the following year concluded with $66 million in sales. The Freestyle success and the athletic shoe fad of the late 1980s saw new competition from Avia, LA Gear, and Nike. Many competitors, like LA Gear and off-price retailers like Fayva, had models that looked like the Freestyle high-top complete with velcro enclosures. Description The Freestyle debuted as a terrycloth lined sneaker with \\"glove-soft\\" leather designed for aerobics workouts. The shoe was designed for fitness purposes but became used for casual wear as well. The shoe comes in two different styles including below the ankle, like a tennis shoe, or the high-top style that covers the ankle, like a basketball shoe. The Freestyle high-top features two velcro straps that fasten around the ankle and is made in women's sizes, but is considered unisex, being also worn by men. Both the low-top and high-top were offered in white, black, red, yellow, blue, pink, orange, and green colors over the years. =Athletic use= Consumers were impressed with the styling, comfort, and support the shoe provided for working out. The Freestyle's athletic use spread to walking, bodybuilding, dance, and cheerleading. Ms. Olympia Cory Everson wore Freestyle high-tops frequently in competition, working out, and on ESPN's BodyShaping program. Reebok sponsored the Los Angeles Laker Girls in the late 1980s and supplied them with white Freestyle high-tops. Since then, other professional cheerleading and dance teams have used Freestyles. High school and college cheerleading teams have used Freestyles as their shoe of choice. It is also used in competitive aerobics. =Casual wear= Outside the gym, the Freestyle became popular casual wear. Women could wear Freestyles with jeans, shorts, capri pants, sweatpants, tights or leggings, and even as commuter shoes to work. In the 1980s, Freestyles were often seen with flop or slouch socks which were usually stretched over the bottom of the pant leg to help highlight the shoe. Styles After the Freestyle's initial debut, Reebok released various collaborations and special edition styles of the shoe. The Freestyle had several special editions released in the 1980s including the Rainbow Suede version. The Freestyle celebrated its 25th anniversary with a special collection of six limited-edition shoes that debuted at a New York City exclusive event in March 2007. The Reebok sponsored event called \\"Freestyle Forever\\" included celebrity guests such as Cybill Shepherd, Brooke Shields, and Tara Reid and highlighted moments in past and present Freestyle history. In 2008, Reebok introduced a Freestyle collaboration with the French boutique Colette and American women's wear company, Married to the Mob. The Reebok Freestyle - Wonder Woman was released in 2009 and had design features such as a red metallic upper with a star-spangled back tab that mimicked the costume of comic book character Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman, and the lace-stay looked similar to the tiara of the superhero while the two gold metallic straps that closely resembled her bracelets. Alicia Keys teamed up with Reebok in 2012 for a collection of different shoes including high-top Freestyles and Freestyle Double Bubble along with Classic Nylon Slim and Princess sneakers. Reebok introduced collaborations with Takahiro Miyashita and the Sand.W.Man project in 2014 for the Reebok Freestyle high-top and the Reebok Ex-o-Fit released in a signature monochromatic, sandy style look. In 2018, the Netflix original series \\"GLOW\\" and Reebok Classics teamed up to create two new Freestyle Hi designs to be worn by characters on the show. Costume designer Beth Morgan shared how the partnership came together: \\"I reached out to Reebok about product placement since we used the shoes so often in the show to see if they had any reproductions of the authentic shoes. Through those conversations, I said it would be awesome to design shoes that were authentic to the period, and they were all on board... The whole idea behind the collaboration is that the product would be in the show, and we could sell them to our fans after we air.\\" In popular culture In 1985, actress Cybill Shepherd wore a bright orange pair or Reebok Freestyles, with a black strapless gown, at the 1985 Emmy Awards. Some women who owned more than one color of Freestyles wore two different colored shoes in combination, like white and black or red and yellow. This trend occurred around the time that the title character of the Punky Brewster television series popularized this style. Rolling Stones front-man Mick Jagger wore a pair of Freestyles in his \\"Dancing in the Street\\" video with David Bowie in 1985. Canadian singer Kiesza has also been photographed wearing various Freestyle shoes, both casually and in her music video for her single \\"Hideaway.\\" The slang name for the shoes was a \\"fifty-four elevens\\" because the retail price for a pair was usually $49.99 and with tax, in New York City, they cost $54.11.

Development The Eta is an example of a trend in glider development in which private pilots initiate the development of new open class gliders. The private development of the Concordia sailplane promises a further elevation of lift-drag ratio of several points. Operational history An Eta participated in a World Championship for the first time in 2003 at Leszno. Its pilot, Janusz Centka, achieved an overall second place. Good placings have also been achieved by the Eta in later competitions. The glider is however hampered by the Open Class weight limitation which limits its wing loading in gusty weather to the advantage of its opponents.

Their traditional lifestyle was that of fishers along this coastal strip and around the river mouths, islands and seas between the Barron River and Port Douglas Language The Irukandji spoke Yirrgay, one of the five dialects of the language group generally known as Djabugay. These dialects indicate that Djabugay was genetically related to Yidiny, with a lexical overlap of 53%. Country Irukandji country, according to Norman Tindale, extended over some , running along the narrow coastal strip from Cairns to the Mowbray River at Port Douglas. Their inland extension went some 7 miles northwest of Cairns, around the tidal waters of the Barron River around Redlynch. Dialects defined tribal distinctions, and the Irukandji dialect Yirrgay, was the southernmost of the group, with the Yidinji people to their immediate south, while, northwards, one encountered, in geographic order, Guluy, Ngakali and finally Djabugay. The Bulway-speakers lay to their west, from Woree to Mareeba. History The Irukandji as a distinct tribal identity were close to extinction by the end of the 19th century. William Parry-Okeden, in a short report on Queensland aborigines written in his capacity as Police Commissioner, wrote in 1897 that he counted 6 Yettkie, a name now thought to refer to a remnant of the Irukandji. The following year Billy Jagar, leader of the Irukandji, received a King plate, designating him as 'King of Barron', a gesture repeated in 1906 with a second plate bearing the same inscription. Jagar died at the age of 60 in 1930 in his traditional payu hut at the northern end of the Cairns Esplanade. Writing in 1974 Tindale stated: > 'The term Irukandji for the people on the coast near Redlynch in the area > around Cairns has been in dispute because of their early demise as a tribe. > By 1952 remembrance of their existence had almost died out and a mixed > Tjapukai and Mamu group, from higher up the Barron River, and from the south > had usurped their territory.

Modern times In recent times there have been clashes in claims advanced respectively by the Yirrganydji Aboriginal Tribal Corporation (Dawul Wuru Aboriginal Corporation) and the Djabugay Aboriginal Tribal Corporation, the former insisting that any development projects by the Djabugay in the historic territories of their Irukandji forebears, require their consent and participation.

Designed by Willis Polk, the 59 foot high classical pavilion is made up of twelve concrete Corinthian columns and a concrete ring girder that supports the conical wood and tile roof. Inside the temple, water originally from the Pleasanton well fields and Arroyo de la Laguna flowed into a white tiled cistern before plunging into a deeper water channel carrying water from the filter galleries to the Niles Aqueduct in Niles Canyon and across San Francisco Bay near the Dumbarton Bridge. The roof covering the cistern has paintings depicting Native American maidens carrying water vessels. The temple is open to the public Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. History The restored ceiling of the temple. The empty sections were never completed. A 1922 map showing the property and pipelines of the SVWC, plus the Sunol Temple. The temple and the surrounding area. Since the mid-19th century a private company, the Spring Valley Water Company (SVWC), owned much of the Alameda Creek Watershed and had held a monopoly on water service to San Francisco. In 1906, William Bowers Bourn II, a major stockholder in the SVWC, and owner of the giant Empire gold mine, hired Willis Polk to design a \\"water temple\\" atop the spot where three subterranean water sources converge (a pipe from the Arroyo de la Laguna, Alameda Creek, through the Sunol infiltration galleries, and a 30-inch pipeline from the artesian well field of Pleasanton). Some sources claim Bourn wanted to sell the water company to the City of San Francisco and saw the temple as a way to appeal to San Francisco voters, who would have to approve the purchase (municipal efforts to buy out the SVWC had been a source of constant controversy from as early as 1873, when the first attempt to purchase it was turned down by the voters because the price was too high). Other sources claim that as one born into wealth and classically educated, Bourn was partially motivated by a sense of civic responsibility. Polk's design, modeled after the ancient Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, Italy, was constructed in 1910 (Tivoli is where many of the waters that fed Rome converged in the foothills of the Apennines). Prior to the construction of the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, half of San Francisco's water supply (6 million gallons a day) passed through the Sunol temple. The SVWC, including the temple, was purchased by San Francisco in 1930 for $40 million. For decades the Water Temple received many visitors and was a popular location for picnickers. By the 1980s the water temple had badly deteriorated, and was severely damaged in 1989's Loma Prieta earthquake, leading some community leaders to call for its demolition. The site was closed to the public because of safety concerns. A community effort led to the temple's restoration from 1997 to 2001, at a cost of $1.2 million, including seismic and accessibility upgrades. Following its restoration the temple opened again to the public. Today any water that flows through the temple is not part of the potable water supply. Fields adjacent to the temple belong to the city of San Francisco which has authorized the digging of a gravel quarry on the site.Griswold, Belinda. \\"Sunol Sellout: PUC allows mining of pristine valley amid conflict charges\\", SF Bay Guardian, May 22, 1996. Local residents concerned about the temple's future brought a lawsuit to attempt block the quarry project, but eventually ran out of funds and dropped the suit. In June 2006, a new facility named the Sunol Agricultural Park was opened on a site adjacent to the temple. The park provides space for small businesses and nonprofit groups to grow produce and was originally a project of a non-profit called Sustainable Agriculture Education (SAGE). The park serves a platform for service and educational programs related to sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation.

Ingredients and consumption The dish contains a dashi or chicken broth soup base with sake or mirin to add flavor. The dish is not made according to a fixed recipe and often contains whatever is available to the cook; the bulk is made up of large quantities of protein sources such as chicken (quartered, skin left on), fish (fried and made into balls), tofu, or sometimes beef, and vegetables (daikon, bok choy, etc.). While considered a reasonably healthy dish in its own right, chankonabe is very protein-rich and usually served in massive quantities, with beer and rice to increase the calorific intake. Leftover chankonabe broth can also later be used as broth for s≈çmen or udon noodles. Chankonabe is traditionally served according to seniority, with the senior wrestlers and any guests of the sumo stable receiving first choice, and the junior wrestlers getting whatever is left. Origin and customs Chankonabe is also a popular restaurant food, often served in restaurants operated by retired sumo wrestlers who specialize in the dish; the first of these, Kawasaki Chanko, was started in 1937 in the Ry≈çgoku district of Tokyo, home to many prominent sumo stables.

It has about 4,400 inhabitants. Polish minority constitute 17.1% of the population. Etymology The name is of topographic origin, supposedly derived from an older name of a hypothetical river or stream Sucha, literally dry, therefore disappearing. The supplementary adjective Horn√≠ (German: Ober, Polish: G√≥rna) means Upper denoting its upper location in comparison to sister settlements: Prost≈ôedn√≠ Such√° (Middle) and Doln√≠ Such√° (Lower). History The village may have been founded by Polish monks from the Order of Saint Benedict from Orlov√° abbey. The first mention of the village comes from a Latin document written by the Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw, called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis, which dates from around 1305. The village is described as item in Sucha utraque. This phrase indicates that there were two villages of that name (utraque meaning both in Latin), with the other being Doln√≠ Such√°. The village initially fell under the jurisdiction of the Duchy of Teschen, which was formed in 1290 during the feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of the Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327, the Duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 fell under the rule of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village was ruled by the Dukes of Cieszyn until 1471, after which it was passed between various Polish and German families, including Melichar Przyznar, who obtained the village in 1536. The north part of the village was eventually taken over by Johann von Larisch-M√∂nnich, a member of the House of Larisch-M√∂nnich, who eventually took over the remaining south part of the village in 1835. The agricultural and industrial development of the village continued into the 19th century. The House of Larisch-M√∂nnich had many business interests here during this period. The sugar refinery, which was the most advanced in middle Europe and the Austrian Empire at that time, was built between 1832 and 1833. It was closed in 1873. The brickyard was founded in 1910, and closed in 1928. The Franti≈°ek Mine was founded in 1911. The village experienced rapid development in the 20th century due to this mine. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed at least since 1880 to political district and legal district of Freistadt. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1,532 in 1880 to 2,761 in 1910. In terms of the dominant language spoken colloquially the majority were Polish-speakers (between 96.1% and 97.9%), accompanied by Czech- speakers (growing from 2 or 0.1% in 1890 to 66 or 2.4% in 1910), and German- speakers (between 1.5% and 2.8%). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (76.8%), followed by Protestants (22.6%), Jews (15 or 0.5%) and 4 others. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect, additionally industrial growth lured a large influx of migrant workers, mostly from western Galicia. =Between 1914 and 1945= Nationalities in Silesia in 1912 After World War I, the Austria-Hungarian Empire fragmented. Horn√≠ Such√° was affected by the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920. Horn√≠ Such√° then became a part of Czechoslovakia. The era between the First and Second World Wars saw rapid development in the village. Many houses were built, in addition to the presbytery and school buildings. As a consequence of the Great Depression, there were numerous dismissals at the Franti≈°ek Mine. The unions staged many protests and strikes, the most important of which was in 1932, between March 29 and April 1. There were confrontations with police, the crowd threw stones, and shots were fired, injuring one policeman. The police returned fire, and two people were seriously injured. The miner W≈Çadys≈Çaw Karwi≈Ñski died. Postcard from Horn√≠ Such√°, 1928 Following the Munich Agreement in October 1938 and the Zaolzie, Horn√≠ Sucha as well as Prost≈ôedn√≠ Such√° and Doln√≠ Such√° were overrun by the Polish army. The region was annexed by Poland, and governed by Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was visited by the Polish president Ignacy Mo≈õcicki. During the Polish occupation, the Czechs experienced discrimination. Citizenship was given only to Poles and long-term inhabitants. Many Czechs left the village. The Polish occupation ended after the German attack on Poland. After the German occupation, Horn√≠ Such√° was part of the Province of Upper Silesia (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz). Horn√≠ Such√°, Prost≈ôedn√≠ Such√° and Doln√≠ Such√° were united into one Sucha. The Franti≈°ek Mine was of interest to the Nazi administration. Soviet prisoners of war were used for mining, and these prisoners endured very difficult conditions. The inhabitants of the village attempted to support them, and in particular delivered food. Inhabitants of Horn√≠ Such√° were involved in the resistance movement. The Polish resistance movement in particular was very active. However, there were repercussions. 26 inhabitants were arrested and sent to concentration camps after an attack on a German newcomer in 1944. Due to the attack in ≈Ωivotice, 36 people were killed on August 6, 1944. Some of them were from Horn√≠ Such√°. In 1945, miners from Mine Franti≈°ek were executed in front of the mine. The village was liberated by the Red Army on May 3, 1945. =From 1945 until 1989= The political situation was more stable in the village during this period. The mine became the focus of the village, and most of the population was employed here. In 1961, the village had 5298 inhabitants. However, because of the mine's growth, there was not enough housing stock available in the village for the expanded workforce. New houses were built, including a small housing estate called Chrost. A new Czech school and kindergarten were erected. From 1975 until 1990 Horn√≠ Such√° was merged with the neighbouring city of Hav√≠≈ôov. =After 1989= The political environment changed dramatically in 1989. The village separated from Hav√≠≈ôov on the basis of the plebiscite in 1990. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was a good deal of investment in the village. A new canteen was built for the new Czech school in 1992, the old Czech school was repaired in 1995-96, a new floor was built in 1997 and a new gym in 2004. Infrastructure repairs to roads, pavements and the gas network were carried out in the early 1990s. New houses were built for elderly members of the population, and new flats for Polish students were built in 2007. The rail station was also repaired in 2007. The housing estate \\"Chrost\\" was revitalised in 2008 and the pavements and roads in the cemetery were repaired. Finally, in the late 2000s, the bridges were repaired and the sports ground for the Czech school was built. Economy The closure of the Franti≈°ek Mine has caused high unemployment in the village. The mine was the focus of economic activity in the village for almost a century, and was united with the Dukla and Lazy Mines in 1995. The headquarters were moved to the Lazy Mine, and Horn√≠ Such√° decreased in importance until its eventual closure in 1999. Many other companies currently operate in the village. These include Befra Electronic, S.R.O., a member of the Munz-Magenwirth Gruppe (electrical engineering), Lichtgitter CZ spol. S.R.O., a member of Lichtgitter GmbH (iron and steel frames and trelliswork), Advanced World Transport, HORNSTAV CZ S.R.O. (construction), Depos Horn√≠ Such√°, a.s. (waste management). After an industrial complex opened on the site of the former Franti≈°ek Mine, unemployment decreased by 10%. As of August 2020, the unemployment rate was 9.2%. Education The building of current municipality, which was used as a school in 19th century The new building of Czech school The first school in Horn√≠ Such√° was founded in 1810 by church officials. A new school building was erected in 1838. The school consisted of only one class until 1869, at which point another was added. The new building was built in 1904, and the Polish school was placed here. =Czech school after World War I= The Czech school was opened after World War I in the 1921-22 school year. After 1938, the Czech schools were closed, and education was provided by Polish and later German schools. =Czech schools after 1945= The Czech schools were reopened after World War II. The first level of the elementary school was located in the \\"old school building\\", the second level in the \\"yellow school building\\", or the Wydzia≈Ç√≥wka, in Polish. The new kindergarten building was erected in 1947 in Podolkovice, and is currently the retirement home. The reform of the education system in 1953 united the first and second level of the elementary school. Because of the growth of pupils in the village, the new building was erected on Tƒõrlick√° Street. This building was opened on January 26, 1961. Classes took place in both the \\"old school building\\" and the \\"new school building\\" after this year. The kindergarten in Podolkovice, which housed both Czech and Polish kindergartens, was closed in 1991. The new dining room in the new school building was opened in the school year 1993/1994 and the old school building was renovated between 1994-1996. The new school building was renovated in 1997 and a new floor was added. The Czech school has used the new school building exclusively since the school year 1997/1998. =Polish schools after 1945= The yellow building of Polish school The development of Polish schools after 1945 was not as rapid as that of the Czech schools. This was due to the falling rate of Polish inhabitants in the village. Due to economic development, especially at Franti≈°ek Mine, newcomers to the village came from all parts of Czechoslovakia. The Polish school had to share buildings with the Czech school until 1961. After the opening of the new Czech school, the situation changed, and the Polish schools used the \\"red\\" and \\"yellow\\" school buildings. There were investments into Polish schools after 1989, with repairs carried out to the gym and the construction of a new computer classroom. Religion Church of Brethren Church The majority of people in Horn√≠ Such√° are atheist. According to the 2001 census, 34.1% of inhabitants are Roman Catholic, in addition to some members of the Silesian Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession and C√≠rkev bratrsk√°. The local Catholic parish was founded in 1867, and is currently part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ostrava-Opava. The Church of Saint Joseph was built in 1864. There is no church of Slezsk√© c√≠rkve evangelick√© augsbursk√©ho vyzn√°n√≠ in Horn√≠ Such√°, rather the members visit the church in Prost≈ôedn√≠ Such√°. Volunteer fire department Fire hall in 1936 Count Larisch founded the first fire department in 1833. The members were workers from the sugar factory and the department closed in 1873. The new fire department was re-founded in 1903. The initiator was local mayor Jan Krzystek. There were 36 first members of the department and all the equipment was bought from presents. The department was integrated into Polish fire department organization. The fire hall was open in 1936. The Czech fire department was founded in 1936. The department declined in the time of World War II. The fire hall was sold, the equipment was confiscated. The Polish department was re-opened in 1945. First fire practise was realized on August 11, 1945. The Czech department used the Polish fire hall. Both Czech and Polish departments were united in 1948. The fire department founded its own band, competition section etc. The fire hall was repaired in 1974. After uniting Horn√≠ Such√° with Hav√≠≈ôov, the fire department was united with Hav√≠≈ôov's one as well. The independent fire department was re-opened in 1990.

The game was created by Werner Ernst George Muller, a German immigrant from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The game is very popular among the Pennsylvania Amish and Dutch community, and among Christian groups in the United States and Canada (primarily in Mennonite communities). The game is similar to Nerts, which is played with standard playing cards and is in turn based on Canfield, a variant of the classic Klondike Solitaire. Unlike Nerts, Dutch Blitz is played with commercially produced cards. It is an alternate version of the game Ligretto, manufactured in Germany.Dutch Blitz (1960)Ligretto (1988)  Contents  The game is played with 160 cards, in four decks; Pump, Carriage, Plow, and Pail. Each deck includes 10 Red, 10 blue, 10 green, and 10 yellow cards.  Terminology  ; Blitz Pile : This pile of 10 cards is the most important pile of cards to each player since it is the key towards \\"Blitzing\\" the other players when all cards from this pile have been cleared. ; Dutch Piles : Stacks of cards in each of the four colors - 1 through 10 an ascending sequence - placed in the center of the table and played upon by all players. Each player accumulates scoring points here. ; Post Piles : Groups of cards placed to the left of both the Blitz and Wood piles in descending sequence For each player, the Post Piles serve as a \\"trading\\" or replacement area during the game. There are generally three post piles but in a two person game four or five post piles are often used to prevent the game from stalling. ; Wood Pile : Stack of cards built to the right of a player, from cards held in that player's hand.  Objective  The objective of Dutch Blitz is to score points by playing as many cards as possible on Dutch Piles, and by emptying the Blitz Pile as quickly as possible. This is done by playing cards from the Blitz Pile, Post Piles, and Wood Pile on the Dutch piles.  Point scoring  The game ends when a player plays all 10 of the cards out of his/her Blitz Pile and yells \\"BLITZ!\\" Each player scores points at the end of each hand as follows: #Add one point for each card that had been thrown out in the Dutch Piles. #Subtract two points for each card the player has left in his/her Blitz Pile. Usually more rounds are played until one player reaches 100 cumulative points, yet some games have gone on for days at a time. Thereby consummating the garrulous winner with the prized crown of wonder.  Variations  A variation of the game relies on larger sized cards and can be called \\"Full Contact Dutch Blitz\\", \\"Running Dutch Blitz\\" or \\"Life Size Dutch Blitz\\". The larger cards must be physically run to their respective piles. This can also be a team game and is a popular activity at church retreats.

Springer, , in honor of Ibn al- Haytham named after Johann Heinrich Lambert, is a quadrilateral in which three of its angles are right angles. Historically, the fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral was of considerable interest since if it could be shown to be a right angle, then the Euclidean parallel postulate could be proved as a theorem. It is now known that the type of the fourth angle depends upon the geometry in which the quadrilateral exists. In hyperbolic geometry the fourth angle is acute, in Euclidean geometry it is a right angle and in elliptic geometry it is an obtuse angle. A Lambert quadrilateral can be constructed from a Saccheri quadrilateral by joining the midpoints of the base and summit of the Saccheri quadrilateral. This line segment is perpendicular to both the base and summit and so either half of the Saccheri quadrilateral is a Lambert quadrilateral.

Their nests are a typical thrush's lined cup of twigs. In both species the male is mainly dark grey or black with yellow legs and bill, and the female essentially warm brown above and paler below. The Platycichla thrushes mainly feed in trees and bushes on fruit and some insects. They are shy species, and the females in particular is difficult to see, since she does not sing. The song of the male consists of melodic musical phrases. The main argument for separating this genus from Turdus is the smaller size of the former compared to most members of the latter.

It was the first self- launching motorglider with retractable engine and propeller to be produced in large numbers. Development The cost of carbon-fibre had fallen enough in the late 1970s to allow its use in the wing spars of high-performance gliders. Glaser-Dirks introduced a carbon wing variant of the DG-200 about this time. Designer Wilhelm Dirks realised that the span, strength and very low weight of this wing allowed for a self-launching engine to be carried in the glider without an unacceptable penalty when soaring in weak conditions. The DG-400 was created as a result. It first flew in May 1981. The DG-400 uses the wings and most systems of the DG-202. It has a modified fuselage with a slightly enlarged tailcone and carbon fibre reinforcements to accommodate the engine, which is a relatively large unit with electric starter and electric retraction. This powerful installation, with a user-friendly engine control unit, made the DG-400 easier to operate than other self-launching gliders. As was typical for the time, the engine, propeller and supporting pylon constitute a single unit that extends into the airflow (in more recent self- launchers the engine usually stays inside the fuselage). The type may be flown either with 15 metre or 17 metre wingtips. The DG-400 was not aimed at competitions, but rather at leisure flying. Nevertheless, several World Gliding Records have been achieved flying this type.

It was claimed to cure chorea, referenced frequently in newspaper headlines as \\"St. Vitus' Dance\\"; as well as \\"locomotor ataxia, partial paralyxia, seistica, neuralgia rheumatism, nervous headache, the after-effects of la grippe, palpitation of the heart, pale and sallow complexions, [and] all forms of weakness in male or female.\\" The pills were available over-the- counter. History In 1890, G. T. Fulford & Company purchased the rights to produce Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People for $53.01 after encountering a pill prescribed by a local physician, William Jackson, and began marketing it through Dr. Williams Medicine Company. Reverend Enoch Hill of M.E. Church of Grand Junction in Iowa, endorsed the product in many 1900s advertisements, claiming that it energized him and cured his chronic headaches. Eventually, the product came to be advertised around the world in 82 countries, including its native Canada, the United States, and Europe. In the late 19th century, the pills were marketed in the UK by the American businessman John Morgan Richards..George Fulford and Victorian Patent Medicine Men: Quack Mercenaries or Smilesian Entrepreneurs? (Lori Loeb, CBMH/BHCM, Volume 16: 1999, pp.125-45) The Pink Pills were widely used across the British Empire and, as the historian of Southeast Asia Mary Kilcline Cody puts it, \\"If the invulnerability magic of the sola topi, the spine pad and the cholera belt failed, Europeans could always rely on the Pink Pills to alleviate the pressures of bearing the white man's burden\\". \\"Mary Kilcline Cody, 'A Paler Shade of White', in Jan van der Putten and Mary Kilcline Cody, eds, Lost Times and Untold Tales from the Malay World, NUS Press, 2009, pp.82-96 The Pink Pills were not only marketed in Europe; tales of its \\"wonder\\" spread even to Egypt. In 1890, a successful Canadian businessman with journalism experience by the name of John MacKenzie helped to publicize the product. In 1892, he was made manager of the medicine company, and held that position until his retirement in 1929. When George Taylor Fulford, Sr., the Canadian senator that founded G. T. Fulford & Company, died in 1905 in an automobile accident, George Taylor Fulford II became involved in the family business. Today, the home of George Taylor Fulford, Sr. in Brockville, Ontario, Fulford Place, is a tourist attraction that showcases the success of patent medicine products. It was acquired by the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 1991. In 2001 they formally put a plaque outside his home with a brief biography. Ingredients Coated in pink-coloured sugar, an analysis of the pills conducted in 1909 for the British Medical Association revealed them to contain sulphate of iron, potassium carbonate, magnesia, powdered liquorice, and sugar. Approximately one third of the iron sulphate in the pills had oxidised in the sampling analysed, leading to the statement that the pills had been \\"very carelessly prepared\\".Secret Remedies: What They Cost & What They Contain,British Medical Association, London 1909, pp170, 174-155. The formula went through several changes, and at one stage included the laxative aloe, the major ingredient of Beecham's Pills. The Pills were finally withdrawn from the market in the 1970s.Popular Medicines: an illustrated history, Homan,Peter G.; Hudson, Briony ; Rowe, Raymond C., Pharmaceutical Press 2008.

She was the third wife of Sima Shi, a regent of the Cao Wei state in the Three Kingdoms period. Her father, Yang Chai (ÁæäËåù), was a commandery administrator while her mother was a daughter of the Han dynasty historian and musician Cai Yong. Her brother was Yang Hu, a military general who served under the Jin dynasty.  Life  In 234, Sima Shi poisoned his first wife, Xiahou Hui because she suspected that he wanted to usurp Cao Wei's power. Later, Sima Shi married another noblewoman (a daughter of Wu Zhi), but not long after they divorce. So he decides to propose a political marriage to Yang Huiyu, because she was a politicized, talented, intelligent and generous woman. Yang Huiyu did not have any sons with Sima Shi ‚Äì who did not have any sons with his prior wives or concubines, either. As a result, his brother Sima Zhao became the regent after his death. After Sima Zhao's death, his son Sima Yan usurped the throne from the last Cao Wei emperor Cao Huan and established the Jin dynasty with himself as the new emperor. In recognition of his uncle's contribution, he honoured Yang Huiyu as an empress dowager in 266 and housed her in Hongxun Palace (which is why she was semi-formally known as Empress Dowager Hongxun). It was said that it was at her insistence that Emperor Wu also posthumously honoured Sima Shi's first wife, Xiahou Hui, as Empress Jinghuai. She died in 278 at the age of 65 (by East Asian age reckoning) and was buried with honours due an empress beside Sima Shi.

It is a I‚ÄìGrade Municipality, which was constituted in the year 1983. It is spread over an area of and has 30 election wards.  History  Nuzvid is a mandal and municipality in Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is 50 km from Vijayawada and 35 km from Eluru. Nuzvid is a historical fort city. It was the capital seat of the famous zamindars of the illustrious Meka-Apparao family and has been a centre of great cultural and literary activity. Many a scholar and a poet had been recipient of annual gratuity and honour from the zamindars, who besides being poets themselves are patrons of learning and arts. Nuzvid was founded by late Meka Basavarayudu, a chieftain subordinate to Maharani Rudrama Devi of the Kakatiya dynasty from Orugallu. The original name of the village is said to be \\"Noojelaveedu\\". There are two legends behind the establishment of this place. According to one legend the chieftain came to the village with his dogs for hunting and while he was hunting, he found to his surprise that his dogs were chased by rabbits! After having witnessed the bravery of the rabbits, he realised the power in this soil and has decided to build his fort over here. The \\"KUKKALAGETU\\" was built depicting this story. The other legend goes that on a certain day as he was going on a hunting excursion he came to a field of gingelly oil seeds where a goat was defending itself most furiously against the attacks of a wolf, this the Rajah considered to be a good omen inasmuch as a feeble animal successfully resisted a mighty one, and on the spot he built his fort; and hence Nuzvid is derived from Nuzvid chetta vidu (the place of the oil seed plant). The earliest authentic account of Nuzvid is found in Mr. Grant's 'Political Survey of the Northern Circars,' written in 1783 and published as an Appendix (p. 205) to the Fifth Report of the Select Committee on the Affairs of the East India Company. Mr. Grant had been for many years resident in Hyderabad and had special opportunities of acquiring correct information. He writes : - 'Nujere, or Noozed, the capital of 'the extensive deshmooky, supposed to appertain by right of 'Sanads, to Macca Narayana Appa Row of the Velarna caste. 'Macca Venkayya, the first of this family, came from the 'Carnatic, and rented five or six villages of Golapille or 'Nujere in 1652; twelve years after, the next in succession 'obtained a lease of the whole pergunnah, and took the name 'of Appa Row, in addition to the local patronymic of Macca‚Äù There is a famous and ancient temple called \\"KOTA MAHALAKSHMI\\" temple in the FORT CAMPUS (Near PG Center).

Biography He was born in the Persian province of Jiba in the early 3rd AH / 9th AD centuries. Al-Makki grew up in Mecca, where he was educated in hadith and the Qur‚Äôan by the city's traditionalist circles. Abu Sa‚Äôid ibn al-Arabi (d. 341 AH/952-3 AD), a student of the sober Sufi Mystic, Junayd of Baghdad, was one of Al-Makki's early traditionalist teachers. Al-Makki moved to Basra in 341 AH, and continued his studies alongside various Sufis before seeking permanent refuge in Baghdad. Al-Makki remained an intense ascetic throughout his life, and was known in Baghdad for his strict dietary regimens. From an early age Makki was weary of ‚Äúpersonal judgment and analogical reasoning,‚Äù and favored using weak hadith literature to support his interpretations of sacred texts when strong hadith failed. He had a son, Umar Ibn Muhammad ibn ‚ÄòAli (d. 444/ 1053). The Sustenance of Hearts Al-Makki's most influential work, \\"Qut al-qulub fi mu'amalat al-mahbub wa wasf tariq al-murid ila maqam al-tawhid\\" , or ‚ÄúThe Sustenance of Hearts,‚Äù is a systematic exploration of Sufism and the ‚Äòknowledge of hearts‚Äô. This knowledge, known as Ma'rifa, is accessible through inward and outward deeds of devotion to God. Al-Makki uses his intimate knowledge of hadith and the Qur'an to argue that Ma'rifa is the only true form of knowledge available to Muslims. Knowledge of God in Classical Sufism: Foundations of Islamic Mystical Theology, Paulist Press (2004), . In ‚ÄúThe Sustenance of Hearts,‚Äù he interprets the Prophet's saying, ‚ÄúThe quest for knowledge is a duty,‚Äù through the five pillars of Islam, as a divine assertion that the sciences of the heart have transcendent value. He outlines at length the elements of a wholly pious life- one informed by the sciences of the heart- and disparages the ‚Äòknowledge of tongues.‚Äô This refers to any form of knowledge that can be used for social and economic benefit. Al-Makki's focused attack on this form of knowledge was likely influenced by the careerism of religious specialities that accompanied Islam's expansion. In part because of his feelings towards the ‚Äòknowledge of tongues‚Äô, Al-Makki has been compared to the early renunciants and People of The Blame. These severe ascetics disdained similarly selfish and innovative practitioners of Islam. Al-Ghazali used this book as a source for some of the chapters of his magnum opus ihya' 'ulum al- din' (Revival of Islamic Knowledge).  References  * Massignon, Louis.

Potrero Point, the point of Potrero Hill, was systematically blasted and cut, its serpentine cliffs removed. The work yielded two square miles of rock for fill and hundreds of acres of flat industrial land east of Illinois Street between 20th Street and Islais Creek. The region has been in regular industrial use since the 1860s, first as a location of a powder magazine and small maritime industries along the steep shoreline and early industries such as Pacific Rolling Mills, and later the famous Union Iron Works plus shipyards and related production, service and shipping-related industries, coal- and gas- fired power plants and energy generating facilities that eventually became Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E;). Centered along Twentieth Street at Illinois Street, the site contains the most extraordinary example of an historic industrial village still extant in the West. The first locomotive, typewriter, printing press, cable car equipment, the famous battleship Oregon and steel for many of San Francisco's 19th-century buildings came from the Potrero. 1918, Looking north. Geography Potrero Point, originally Point San Quentin, was a peninsular extension of Potrero Hill on the south east side of the city of San Francisco, marking the southern extremity of the now filled in Mission Bay in San Francisco, California.Nancy Olmsted, Mission Bay Gazeteer of Historic Places, foldout at the end of \\"Vanished Waters: A History of San Francisco's Mission Bay\\" published by the Mission Creek Conservancy , and republished by foundsf.org with their permission. From foundsf.org accessed 3/29/2015. By virtue of its geography, the point was a natural potrero. Potrero Point and surrounding areas have changed drastically over the past 150 years, with a small hill being all that remains. Potrero Point drew the attention of industrialists after the California Gold Rush because it had cheap land isolated from the densely populated city center and because of its natural deep water access. Industrialists and speculators sought to exploit Potrero Point's natural advantages and to overcome the obstacle caused by the swampy Mission Bay. The natural contour of the bay shore was changed by filling, with much of the fill material was taken in the process of blasting away the serpentine hills that once rose above the point. The steep camel-back ridge extending into the bay offered deep water access connected to the Potrero Hills, the site was first cut off by the Third Street cut, and later leveled for land building. The geography of the bay shore, with Mission Bay cutting off Potrero Point and much of the southeastern portion of the city led to the construction of Long Bridge in 1868. The bridge connected Potrero Point to the city, and extended further south to the Bayshore district. Eventually, Mission Bay was completely developed, and the shoreline south of Potrero Point was altered dramatically to suit the intense industrial construction taking place. History =Early history= The Mexican landowner, Don Francisco de Haro, owned Rancho Potrero de San Francisco and ran sheep and cattle on the land for many years. After the conquest of California by the United States in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, a protracted legal struggle ensued and the DeHaro family eventually lost their claim to the land. In 1863, development along the banks of Potrero Point consisted of two powder magazines on the southern side of the steep peninsula, located so as to keep dangerous commodities away from populated areas. Heavy industry first located on the point in 1866 when six wealthy San Francisco industrialists came together to organize the Pacific Rolling Mills with the plan to roll iron from scrap, in the hope of producing homegrown iron products, including railroad iron. Access to deep water was a necessity for delivering coal from Australia to fuel the mills, firebrick and clay from Liverpool and scrap iron from around the Pacific Rim and as far away as England. There was a lack of level ground at the site, and cutting and leveling the hill and filling in the bay became a top priority. Eventually, two square miles of Potrero Point were removed and hundreds of acres of flat industrial land was created. Within two years and after one million dollars in expenses, foundries, piers, storehouses and wharves were in place, and the first finished iron produced on the West Coast came out of the mill. San Francisco's population growth increased along with the demand for iron products, and with the growth of railroads and street cars on the west coast, the output from PRM doubled, and doubled again. By 1873, the mill turned out rod, wire, shafts, axles, I-beams, wrought iron and hammered iron of every type needed by the growing metropolis. By the end of the 1880s the mill had five main buildings along three blocks of waterfront and employed a thousand men. Potrero Point quickly became the site for some of California's most important heavy industries, including shipbuilding and the manufacture of mining machinery, while the hill continued to be cut and the bay mudflats filled. Submarines were built nearby the Potrero Union Iron Works shipyards. =World War I= Union Iron Works output during World War I was important, and included a large number of destroyers. The Shipyards, all ships in progress and the 9,000 workers were commandeered by the United States Navy in August 1917 for the war effort, run by the Shipping Board with the happy acquiescence of Bethlehem Steel, holder of $130 million in Government contracts. From 1917 to 1924, when the government contracts were filled, the Potrero yards turned out twenty-six 1060-ton destroyers, forty 1190-ton destroyers, twelve \\"S\\" type submarines and six \\"R\\" type submarines, according to Bethlehem Steel (1949). On July 4, 1918, four destroyers were launched and four keels laid at the Union Iron Works yards, and four destroyers launched and four keels laid at the Risdon yards. From 1914 to 1945 the northern parts of Potrero Point were the scene of major shipbuilding, repair and refitting. The Union yard was continually busy and was the principal yard in San Francisco for repairs. Between the wars, shipbuilding, and especially refitting, continued at the Potrero yards. =World War II= Before 1941, the shipyard at what is now Pier 70 produced some of its best ships. By the late 1930s, though, with war looming, Bethlehem began to modernize and upgrade the Potrero Yard. A number of new buildings were constructed, and by the time World War II began Potrero was one of the most productive shipyards in the country. During World War Two, the government once again took over the Potrero Point yards for the war effort. During the war, up to 4,000 men and women were employed, working three shifts a day. Finding skilled workers during wartime was a huge challenge, and much was done to train new workers, and to organize shipbuilding so that less skilled people could do what the highly skilled people had done before. At the height of the war effort productivity was tremendous: the destroyer escort Fieberling was built in 24 days, start to finish. Though Liberty ships and other simpler ships could be built faster, to build a modern warship in that amount of time was an incredible achievement. During the war, Bethlehem's Potrero yard produced 72 vessels (52 for combat) and repaired over 2,500 navy and commercial craft. Bethlehem Shipyards, along with Alameda and Hunters Point, managed by Bethlehem, made the San Francisco Bay Area the most productive shipbuilding area in the U.S. during World War II. =Postwar era= After an intense period of ship repair and refitting during the war years, the Potrero point shipyards went into slow decline. From 1947 to 1953, no shipbuilding occurred and the yards became places for ship repairs, upgrades and commercial work. In the 1960s, a staging area for the Bay Area Rapid Transit underwater tube sections was established. In the 1960s, Bethlehem Steel built the largest floating drydock in the world at the Potrero site. In the 1980s, the city of San Francisco purchased the property for one dollar and the Todd Shipyard Corporation bought the plant and the equipment for $14 million and leased the site from the city. Currently, work is carried out under the name San Francisco Drydock Company. Major businesses Pier 70 in San Francisco is currently occupied by BAE Systems Ship Repair, which once housed the SS Oceanic, and Sims Group, a metal operator, and the Port of San Francisco currently has plans for redevelopment. =Potrero Generating Station= The Potrero Generating Station, located at the site of the first electrical power plant in California, was a 362 MW natural gas- and oil-fired power plant which supplied approximately 1/3 of the City of San Francisco's power needs. The plant was shut down in January, 2011. =Union Iron Works= The Union Iron Works, located on Potrero Point is the longest running privately owned shipyard in the country. It built the first steel hulled ship on the West coast. It also constructed several warships including and two s. =Manufactured gas= In 1872, Pacific Rolling Mills was joined in the Potrero by the City Gas Company, a coal gasification plant built to supply gas for lighting the city. Coal (and later fuel oil) steam generation was used to generate heat, power and electricity. The gas plant in the Potrero was for many years the largest and most important gas manufacturing plant in San Francisco. Construction began in 1870 on lots between Humboldt and Sierra streets (later renamed). Originally a coal-gas works, Springer water-gas generators were added in 1888. By 1905, PG&E; had consolidated much of the power generation in the state, including the Potrero works. After the 1906 removal of the coal-gas retorts, the Potrero plant became an oil-gas facility. For fifty years the Potrero plant used gasification to drive steam turbines and power the city of San Francisco. In 1930, transporting natural gas over long distances was employed in California, and natural gas arrived at Potrero. The Potrero gas works were put on standby status until their demolition in the 1950s. =California Sugar Refinery= Claus Spreckels, a German immigrant, began sugar production in 1867. The California Sugar Refinery outgrew its facilities at Eighth and Brannan streets and in 1881, moved to the southern part of Potrero Point where they had deep water access for the ships filled with cane from the Hawaiian island cane farms Spreckels controlled. In the 1890s, Spreckels joined with the national sugar trust. The refinery in the Potrero was renamed the Western Sugar Refinery. The huge Victorian-era brick refinery buildings were in use until demolished in 1951. =California Barrel Company= Among the variety of maritime related industries in the Potrero was a quarter mile long ropewalk and the \\"California Barrel Company,\\" With five large buildings, the barrel company had three warehouses, a power generating house and the factory itself. =Other businesses= Also dating from the 1850s was the ropewalk of the Tubbs Cordage Company at the southern edge of Potrero Point. It was founded by two brothers in the ship chandlery business who realized the west needed rope for its growing maritime industries. They recruited a group of skilled workers from New England who formed the core of the Tubbs workforce for decades. Tubbs imported raw materials from the Philippines and became a worldwide concern. Numerous other maritime related industries had their works at Potrero. Labor The labor history of the shipyards at Potrero is not well documented. Bethlehem Shipbuilding, like the Union Iron Works, fought hard to keep unionization out of the shipyards. Strikes, some of them protracted, occurred periodically throughout the active shipbuilding period, including during the war years and immediately after. One important strike in the spring of 1941 halted major naval shipbuilding for a month and a half, leading to the intervention of President Roosevelt in efforts to end the strike. Members of the machinist union's local resisted the federal government and their own national leaders and persisted in the strike. They succeeded for the first time in achieving a closed shop at Bethlehem. Historic buildings Potrero Point is eligible for the National Register as an historic district for its contribution to three war efforts (Spanish- American War, World War I & World War II) and because of the 19th century buildings that remain. In 1994, what was then called the Landmarks Board submitted historical nominations to the Board of Supervisors for the 1917 Frederick Meyer Renaissance Revival Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation office building, the Charles P. Weeks designed Power House#1 built in 1912, the 1896 Union Iron Works office designed by Percy & Hamilton and the huge 1885 Machine shops. listed on the National Register of Historic Places April 17, 2014.

The decision reached this conclusion through a discussion of evidence regarding the arbitrary nature of execution, although the Court did not go so far as to say execution was also unconstitutional under section 12 of the Charter, which forbids cruel and unusual punishments. The case essentially overruled Kindler v Canada (Minister of Justice) (1991) and Reference Re Ng Extradition (1991).Peter Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed., page 992. In Burns, the Supreme Court justices claimed to be considering different kinds of evidence. Background The police department in Bellevue, Washington, of the United States accused two Canadian citizens, Glen Sebastian Burns and Atif Ahmad Rafay, of murdering Rafay's family. After returning to Canada, Burns and Rafay confessed to undercover Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The RCMP used the Mr. Big tactic to extract the confessions, a practice that is illegal in the United States, but legal in Canada. After the investigation was complete, Burns and Rafay claimed their confessions were false, highly manipulated, and that jurors were biased by the media coverage of the crime. Nonetheless, plans were made to extradite Burns and Rafay.The Fifth State - True Confessions - Timeline of Events - Aired October 14, 2011, cbc.ca; accessed October 13, 2017. The extradition would be possible through an extradition treaty under which the Minister of Justice for Canada may seek assurances that the fugitive accused would not be subject to the death penalty. However, the Minister of Justice did not seek assurances in the case. Burns and Rafay launched a number of Charter challenges to the Canadian government's decision, including that section 6 mobility rights provided them rights against extradition and to be charged in Canada (since the murders occurred in the US, Canada could only charge them with planning the crime, so this option was ruled out). It was further argued that, while the Kindler case had held that it was not a breach of fundamental justice to extradite persons regardless of the risk of execution, the Burns case was special because it involved Canadian citizens; section 6 rights against exile were used to reinforce this argument. Decision The decision of the Court was unanimous and anonymously written, and held that extradition in this case, involving the risk of execution, would indeed be unconstitutional under the Charter. Indeed, the government of Canada should always try to avoid execution, except in \\"exceptional circumstances\\" (likely to mean crimes against humanity). However, the Court rejected any arguments made under section 6, by citing precedent that while extradition, in and of itself, violates section 6, this was permissible under the reasonable limits clause in section 1 of the Charter. The Court also found it useful to cite the case Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca. Since the rights claimant in that case was extradited even though he was so old he would probably die in prison, and thus his rights to return to Canada would be constitutionally denied, in this case, constitutional denial of Burns and Rafay's rights to return to Canada as well made sense‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äî as, whether executed or given a life sentence, Burns and Rafay, if convicted, were not expected to return. The Court also declined to consider the case on the basis of the section 12 ban on cruel and unusual punishments. This was because section 32 makes section 12 binding only on punishments dispensed by the Canadian government, not the US government. While Burns might then be of little relevance to a section 12 debate if the Canadian government restored the death penalty in Canada, the Court did hint that execution \\"engages the underlying values of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment,\\" noting its impossibility to correct (in cases of wrongful conviction) and its perceived arbitrary nature. While section 12 was of little direct consequence in Burns, there was precedent that the government of Canada has some responsibility to consider possible outcomes of extradition under section 7 of the Charter (and section 12, like other legal rights, helps to define the broad principles of section 7). Section 7 guarantees rights to life, liberty and security of the person, to be deprived only with respect to fundamental justice. The applicability of section 7 was thus evident through the infringement of Burns and Rafay's right to life, liberty and security of the person, since \\"Their lives are potentially at risk.\\" Extradition might then breach fundamental justice because, according to precedent in Canada v Schmidt, if the harm faced by the extradited persons is serious enough, it \\"shocks the conscience\\" of the Canadian population. Still, the Kindler case had indicated that extradition regardless of the risk of execution was not a breach of section 7. The Court in Burns thus had to overrule this. While acknowledging Kindler's \\"balancing process\\", the Court wrote that various factors considered in this process will change with the times, and in this case the Court was confronted with more of the \\"practical and philosophic difficulties associated with the death penalty\\". In considering the relationship between fundamental justice and execution, the Court wrote that \\"philosophic\\" views of fundamental justice that viewed execution as \\"inconsistent with the sanctity of human life\\" were not subject to judicial review, and that the Court could instead consider more legal issues such as \\"the protection of the innocent, the avoidance of miscarriages of justice, and the rectification of miscarriages of justice where they are found to exist.\\" Hence wrongful convictions were especially to be feared in cases involving execution. There were arguments that allowing a risk of execution could be compatible with fundamental justice, since the accused had committed a crime in another state and thus no longer had the benefits of Canadian law, and since states should work together to fight crime. However, there were also arguments that this extradition was contrary to fundamental justice. These included that execution no longer existed in Canada itself, and the legal importance of this state of affairs was reinforced by 40 years of continuity. The Court also cited Reference Re BC Motor Vehicle Act to note that international law was important in defining fundamental justice, and while there was no international law against execution per se, international politics are moving in that direction, and more and more states have abolished the death penalty. The Court paid a fair amount of attention to the risk of wrongful conviction, and how the Court had a duty to protect the innocent. This duty is based in part on section 11 of the Charter, which includes a right to, for example, presumption of innocence. To illustrate this point, cases of wrongful convictions were cited from Canada (the case of Donald Marshall, Jr. was specifically mentioned), the US and the United Kingdom. While \\"[t]hese miscarriages of justice of course represent a tiny and wholly exceptional fraction of the workload of Canadian courts in murder cases,\\" the Court wrote, \\"where capital punishment is sought, the state's execution of even one innocent person is one too many.\\" The Court also acknowledged the \\"death row phenomenon\\" as a section 7 concern, noting the psychological stress that would be involved if one is sentenced to die. The Court cited statements from parliament on capital punishment. The judgement noted that parliament abolished the last death penalty under Canadian law in 1998 with amendments to the National Defence Act. The court cited statements by the Cabinet to characterize this and other acts of Parliament. \\"In his letter to the respondents, the Minister of Justice emphasized that 'in Canada, Parliament has decided that capital punishment is not an appropriate penalty for crimes committed here...'.\\" In balancing the arguments that this extradition could be compatible or contrary to fundamental justice, the Court concluded that many of the goals of the Crown could have been met even if Canada had requested that the US would not seek the death penalty. There was thus an infringement of section 7, and the Court then had to consider whether it could be justified under section 1. The Court ruled the infringement was not justified. While the government had a sufficient objective for infringing the right, namely working with the US cooperatively to fight crime and to keep good relations with the US, it was not necessary to risk execution for these objectives to be met. Asking that the death penalty should not be sought should not hurt relations with the US because the extradition treaty allows for this. There was also a concern about keeping dangerous criminals out of Canada, but the Court replied that criminals might not find extradition with the risk of a life sentence more attractive than the risk of execution, and thus it was not proven criminals would flee to Canada. Resulting extradition and trial In March 2001, less than a month after the ruling, Burns and Rafay were extradited to the United States with assurances from prosecutors handling the case that they would not seek the death penalty. During the trial in 2004 (it was delayed by a number of factors), prosecutors claimed that Burns and Rafay plotted to kill Rafay's family and share the money from an insurance policy and the sale of the family home. Burns claimed that his confession to undercover RCMP officers that he and Rafay killed Rafay's family was the result of coercion by the police. Defense lawyers noted that no forensic evidence linked the two men to the crime.Filmmaker explores issue of coerced confessions, CTV News, August 26, 2007; retrieved December 14, 2008.Michael D.

Several species are known as drone flies (or droneflies) because they bear a resemblance to honeybee drones. Drone flies and their relatives are fairly common generalist pollinators, the larvae of which are aquatic, and breathe through a long, snorkel-like appendage, hence the common name rat- tailed maggots. Eristalis is a large genus of around 99 species, and is subdivided into several subgenera and species groups (Eristalomyia, Eristalis, Eoseristalis etc.). Scientific name and grammatical gender The scientific name was proposed by Pierre Andr√© Latreille in 1804. He placed seven species in his new genus, but listed the names as combinations with Syrphus, so it remained unclear what gender he attributed to the name (the gender of the name Syrphus is masculine). In the two centuries following its publication, Eristalis was sometimes considered to be of feminine gender, sometimes to be of masculine gender. George Henry Verrall (1901)Verrall, G.H. (1901). A list of British Diptera: 22; and, according to Chandler et al., Case 3259 (see there) also in British Flies vol. 8 assigned its gender as masculine, a choice followed in British literature, and also in Dutch, Polish, Czech, Spanish and Portuguese literature. In several other European languages and in North America, the tradition was to consider it as a feminine word. In 1993 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature placed the name on the Official List, and gave its gender as masculine, without justification for that choice.ICZN (1993). Opinion 1747. Eristalis Latreille, 1804, Helophilus Fabricius, 1805, Xylota Meigen, 1822 and Eumerus Meigen, 1822 (Insecta; Diptera): conserved.

History 225px Regions Geographic Footprint Regions Financial Corporation, formerly known as First Alabama Bancshares, was founded on July 13, 1971 with the merger of three Alabama banks: First National Bank of Montgomery, Alabama (opened 1871), Exchange Security Bank of Birmingham, Alabama (opened 1928), and First National Bank of Huntsville, Alabama (opened 1856). The headquarters of First National Bank of Huntsville was a historic building built in 1835. It served as a hospital for Union soldiers during the American Civil War, and once held a rifle owned by Frank James as collateral for bail money when he was incarcerated across the street in the Madison County Jail. Until their formal merger in March 1985, under revised banking regulations, the banks continued to operate independently. In 1986, changes in the Interstate Banking Bill allowed bank holding companies to purchase bank branches outside the state in which they were chartered. First Alabama Bancshares expanded its operations first into Florida, continuing into Georgia, Tennessee, and Arkansas. In 1994, to reflect its growth into a regional company, First Alabama Bancshares changed its name to Regions Financial Corporation and the name of its banking subsidiary to Regions Bank. Regions added banking branches in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, South Carolina, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. The name \\"Regions\\" was purchased from First Commercial Corporation, the Arkansas Bank that Regions subsequently purchased in 1998. In 2001, Regions acquired Rebsamen Insurance Company, which was renamed Regions Insurance Group. frame In 2001, Regions acquired Morgan Keegan & Company for $789 million. In January 2012, Regions sold Morgan Keegan to Raymond James for $930 million. The trust department was retained by Regions and now operates as Regions Trust. In 2002, the company announced that it will list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2002, Regions acquired Independence Bank for approximately $24 million in cash. On January 24, 2004, Regions merged with Memphis, Tennessee based Union Planters Bank in a $5.9 billion transaction. Jackson W. Moore, the former CEO of Union Planters, became CEO of the merged company. He suffered a stroke after the merger closed, but was still able to assume his new post upon recovery. After the merger, Regions adopted Union Planters' former logo of a young cotton plant and used it until the AmSouth conversion. The merger significantly increased Regions' footprint in Tennessee; Union Planters had been the largest Tennessee-based bank. In 2006, Regions acquired AmSouth Bancorporation, another Birmingham based bank, in a $10 billion transaction. While Regions was the surviving company, the merged entity adopted AmSouth's corporate structure. In 2008, Regions Bank received a $3.5 billion loan as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. On April 4, 2012 Regions repaid the $3.5 billion loan.

In the 16th century it became an important center for the Sikh religion during the Guruship of the Guru Amar Das Ji. Goindwal is on the banks of the river Beas and is one of the focal points of small scale industries of Tarn Taran district. Guru Amar Das Ji (the third Guru or the third Nanak) stayed in Goindwal for 33 years where he established a new centre for preaching Sikhism. A Baoli (stepwell), paved with 84 steps was constructed there. Sikh‚Äôs believe that by reciting Japji Sahib, the divine Word revealed to Guru Nanak Dev Ji, at each of the 84 steps after taking a bath in the Baoli provides Moksha, liberation from 84,00,000 cycles of life of this world and unity with God (mukhti). Goindval is where Guru Amar Das Ji met Guru Ram Das Ji, the next Guru. Guru Arjan Dev Ji was also born there on 15 April 1563. It is called axis of Sikhism as it was the first center of Sikhism. Today the Gurdwara and Goindwal Baoli is visited as a prime tourist destination and the massive langar or the community kitchen provides food to a large number of visitors every day.  History  = The origin of the Goindwal name = The location of the town was an ancient eastwest highway that crossed the river Beas connecting Delhi and Lahore and the head of the most important ferries on the river Beas. With the renovation of the highway by Sher Shah Suri, the Afghan ruler of north India (1540‚Äì45), this ferry site became an important transit point. This led one Goinda or Gonda, a Marvaha Khatri trader, to plan establishing an habitation at the western end of the ferry. Thwarted in his endeavour by natural calamities which Goinda attributed to evil spirits which nobody settled there, Goinda went to Khadur to seek Guru Angad Dev Ji's blessing and asked if anyone of the two Guru's sons of the Guru starts living there, the superstition of the people regarding the evil spirits will vanish and the village will be inhabited. The Guru agreed to help Goinda but none of the Guru's sons agreed to this proposal so the Guru asked his devoted disciple, (Guru) Amar Das, to help Goinda. Bhai Amar Das Ji, who knew that tract very well as he had been carrying river water from this place to Khadur daily for his Master\`s ablutions, laid the foundation of Goinda's village which then was named after Goinda, Goindwal. The trader Goinda had a special place built in Goindwal to honor Guru Angad Dev Ji. = Bhai Amar Das Ji's daily seva of bringing water for Guru Angad Dev Ji = The Guru Ji requested Bhai Amar Das Ji to make Goindwal his home. During the night Bhai Amar Das Ji slept in Goindwal and during the day he resumed his duties and carried water from the river Beas to Khadur for Guru Angad Dev Ji‚Äôs morning bath. Along the way Bhai Amar Das Ji recited \\"Japji Sahib\\", the Sikh's morning prayer. Gurdwara Damdama Sahib was built in commemoration of the place where Guru Amar Das Ji took rest under a tree about one and a half miles from Goindwal, the historic tree which is also still preserved today. Guru Amardas Ji stayed in Khadur to hear the hymn of \\"Asa di Var\\", a composition of Guru Angad Dev Ji, interspersed with hymns of Nanak. He then returned to Goindwal to fetch more water for the Guru‚Äôs communal kitchen and carried it back to Khadur where Guru Angad Dev Ji, and his followers resided. = Sikh Development in Goindwal = Guru Angad Dev Ji asked his faithful follower, Bhai Amar Das Ji, to oversee the project of building Goindwal. The Guru gave Bhai Amar Das Ji a staff with instructions that it should be used for the removal of any obstacles. Guru Angad Dev Ji selected Bhai Amar Das Ji as the most faithful of his Sikhs and appointed him to be his successor. Guru Amar Das Ji shifted from Khadur to Goindwal with his family and followers after his anointment as Guru in 1552 at the age of 73. That year Guru Amar Das Ji commenced the digging in Goindwal of a Baoli, i.e. a well with steps descending down to water level which, when completed, attracted pilgrims from far and near. Goindwal also became in the time of Guru Amar Das Ji the centre of an annual fair on the occasion of Vaisakhi festival which Guru Amar Das started in Goindval. Guru Amar Das Ji also made Langar an integral activity of the Sikh community and he insisted that anyone who wanted to see him had to first partake of food at the Langar creating the proverb 'Pehlay Pangat tay picchhay Sangat' - First sit in the 'Community of Feet', and then join the 'Company of Singers'. Guru Amar Das Ji developed the new system of propagating the new faith in far off places known as the Manji System, stopped the practice of Sati and wrote the Anand Sahib bani at Goindwal. Bhai Gurdas, a prominent Sikh poet, was born in Goindwal in 1551. Guru Arjan came to Goindwal to get the first 4 Guru's hymns from Baba Mohan to compile into the Adi Granth. = Guru Amar Das Ji leaves Goindwal = After Gurgaddi of Guru Amar Das Ji people visited in large crowds for a spiritual glimpse of the third Guru. This angered the jealous Dattu, the younger son of Guru Angad Dev Ji. Dattu come to Goindwal and found the Guru who was surrounded by his disples. In rage he kicked the Guru; the Guru immediately touched his foot and feeling sorry said his foot might have been hurt by his aged bones. This event and the overall dislike that Dattu had for Guru Amar Das was the cause for Guru Amar Das to decide to briefly leave Goindwal. Guru Amar Das Ji shifted himself to his native village Basarke and closeted himself in a secluded place. The guru had written on the outside door that whosoever opens the door will not be his Sikh and he will not be his Guru. However, when the devotees became impatient to have a glimpse of the Guru, Baba Budha, instead of opening the front door, broke open the back wall and enabled the devotees to reach the Guru. The devotees led by Baba Budha requested the Guru come back to Goindwal and then took him there. Gurdwara Sann Sahib commemorates this incident. = Emperor Akbar's visit = According to the historians, Emperor Akbar once visited the Guru in Goindwal in 1598 and took lunch in the Langar while he was going from Delhi to Lahore. Akbar was highly impressed by the tradition of Langer that he granted land in the name of Bibi Bhani, the daughter of the Guru. The Guru directed his son in law, Guru Ram Das to found Amritsar upon that newly granted land. = Bhai Jetha (Guru Ram Das) at Goindwal = Guru Ram Das, whose original name before becoming the Guru was Bhai Jetha, arrived at Goindwal to remain in contact with Guru Amar Das who he had seen previously at Khadur. Bhai Jetha started earning his bread by selling cooked beans however he spent most of his time in the service for the construction of the Baoli and in the community kitchen. Guru Amar Das and his wife Mata Mansa Devi recognized Bhai Jetha's upright character and steadfast service and decided to get their daughter, Bibi Bhani married to him, they married on 1 February 1554. The couple stayed in Goindwal to remain in the service of the Guru. They had three sons, Bhai Prithi Chand, Bhai Mahadev, and Bhai Arjun Dev (later known as Guru Arjan Dev). After Guru Amar Das\`s successor. Guru Ram Das, had built up Amritsar and made it his permanent seat but devotees still continued to visit Goindval to have a dip in the sacred Baoli and pay homage at other local shrines. = Guru Hargobind and Guru Tegh Bahadur's visit = Guru Hargobind with his family travelled from Jhabal to Goindwal. As they reached Goindwal, Guru Hargobind, his family, and his Sikhs made ablutions in the Goindwal Baoli built by Guru Amar Das. Bhai Tegh Bahadur, then barely two, was bathed with the holy water. Ablutions were repeated the following morning before Guru Hargobind left for Kartarpur. The family were left in Goindwal on the persuasion of Baba Sundar, great-grandson of Guru Amar Das. Upon his return to Amritsar, Guru Hargobind recalled the family from Goindwal. Guru Tegh Bahadur also visited Goindwal again in 1664 after first halt during this journey was at Amritsar, followed by halts at Tarn Taran, and Khadur Sahib. = Guru Har Rai's visit = When the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's eldest son Dara Shikoh was seriously ill Guru Har Rai sent a herbal medicine which cured him. Thus Sikh - Mughals relations remained on a good footing for a short time. There was eventual instability in the Delhi royal court when Shah Jehan fell ill and his second son Aurangzeb aligned himself with his youngest brother Murad against their eldest brother Dara Shikoh, Shah Jehan's approved successor. Aurangzeb imprisoned his father in Agra and his soldiers as well as those of his youngest brother Murad forced Dara Shikoh to flee towards Punjab. Guru Har Rai was visiting Goindwal in June 1558 along with 2200 horse riders and here he met Dara Shikoh who had come to receive his blessings. Dara Shikoh remembered that the Guru had been responsible for saving his life when he was sick. Dara Shikoh was both an intellectual and liberally tolerant towards other religions. He was a great admirer of the Muslim Sufi Saint Mian Mir who was in turn a great admirer of the Gurus. Guru Har Rai granted Dara Shikoh an audience and received the prince with due courtesy. After some time Dara Shikoh was eventually captured by the forces of Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb had Dara Shikoh executed, then killed his own youngest brother Murad and appointed himself as the emperor.  Architecture  The entrance of Goindwal is decorated with murals describing significant scenes of the Sikh history. The main gurdwara, standing next to the Baoli, white against the chequerboard of the courtyard. The Gurdwara is an example of typical Sikh architecture with a large dome tipped with a gold pinnacle - four cupolas echoing the main dome in shape and the ubiquitous facade of turrets, elliptical cornices and projected windows. Goindwal Baoli, the well of Goindwal Guru Amar Das had a Baoli, or covered step-well, constructed in Goindwal. The step-well spans about 25 feet or 8 meters. The well has a few resting places between the 84 steps providing the Sikhs a place to get together and have spiritual discussion. An arched access opens to a domed entrance decorated with frescoes depicting the life of Guru Amar Das. A divided underground staircase with 84 covered steps descends beneath the earth to Goindwal's sacred waters. The Baoli is entered through a wide, pointed archway and the structure is surmounted by a large fluted dome. There are projected eaves on all sides, while the front face also has a row of small turrets. The cornice under the dome is multi-coloured with floral designs.

Although his filmography was brief, his films placed Thai cinema on the world stage. He also pushed for innovations, and was one of the first Thai directors to use 35-mm film. He died just as he was giving a speech to government officials to call for support of a domestic industry he saw as coming under threat from Hollywood films. Biography =Early life= He was born Rattan Pestonji (also sometimes referred to as R. D. Pestonji or Ratt Pestonji) in Bangkok, to Parsi parents who adhered to the Zoroastrian faith. His parents immigrated from Lahore, Punjab in present-day Pakistan with ancestral roots from the Indian state of Gujarat).Individuals can make a differencePestonjiArtist profileThe Parsi way of life At an early age, he showed an avid interest in photography. He was so adept at dismantling and reassembling his camera, that it was decided he should study engineering at the University of London. Between studies in London, he was able to take photos and he picked up several awards in photographic competitions. He returned to Thailand with an engineering degree, but continued to pursue his interest in photography and found a job as a film salesman. It was then he began to explore an art form that was still in its infancy ‚Äì cinematography. =His first films= In 1937, Rattana shot his first film, a short called Tang, about a young Thai girl. Tang won the Amateur Cine Competition in Glasgow, Scotland and Rattana was given the top award by Alfred Hitckcock, who was president of the jury. He made another short called White Boat in 1939 and it was shown at the New York World Festival. Rattana continued his work in film sales, but he was given his big break into filmmaking in 1949 when he was asked by Prince Bhanu Yugala to act as a cameraman on the film Phanthaay Norasingh (Oarsman Norasingh). Rattana showed great talent as a cinematographer. Around this time, Rattana formed his own studio, Hanuman Films Company. He directed his first feature film, Dear Dolly in 1951. =Pushing for innovations= In each of his films, Rattana sought to experiment and raise the standard of production. At a time when post-dubbed 16 mm films were the industry standard in Thailand, Rattana wanted to use 35 mm stock, which was more expensive and technically difficult to work with, but it allowed for the sound to be recorded along with the image. His first 35-mm film was the drama, Santi-Vina, on which he worked as cinematographer only. It was directed by Thavi Na Bangchang (better known as \\"Kru Marut\\") with a screenplay by Vichit Kounavudhi. Santi-Vina was among the first Thai films to be sent to an overseas competition, the 1954 Asia Pacific Film Festival in Tokyo. It was a sensation, sweeping the awards for best cinematography, art direction and the Golden Harvest Award for best Asian cultural presentation. Still, Rattana would run afoul of the Thai government, and upon his return from the festival, he was charged $5,000 tax for the $16,000 Mitchell Camera he won, and was fined 1,000 baht for failing to clear his film with the Thai censor. =Career as director= Undaunted, Rattana continued his work, working as cinematographer on the romantic drama Chuafah Din Salai (Dying Forever) and then taking the director's chair for Rongraem Narok. For Rongraem Narok, (literally hotel hell, but entitled Country Hotel in English), he employed the use of one camera on a single set, similar to Hitchcock's 1948 film, Rope. The film had a bit of everything ‚Äì rustic comedy, music (including a full ballad by a Filipina singer), rough-and-tumble action and dark, thrilling drama. (Additional use of search field for \\"Thailand\\" helps to find the links to the films.) His first color film was 1958's Sawan Mued (Dark Heaven), which featured songs and some dramatic battlefield scenes. Next was Prae Dum (Black Silk), which is regarded as Thailand‚Äôs first film noir (though Country Hotel had film noir elements as well). It is regarded as Rattana's best work. He performed almost all the major tasks himself, acting as writer, producer, director, cinematographer and editor. For his efforts, Prae Dum was included in competition at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival in 1961. His final film was made in 1965, Nahmtaan Mai Waan (Sugar Is Not Sweet). A romantic farce, it is a vibrant film that takes visual cues from the pop-art style of Western films of the time. =Death while giving a speech= Whilst Rattana was artistically respected, his films ‚Äì featuring unhappy endings ‚Äì were mostly commercial failures. Frustrated, he retired from filmmaking. However, he continued to be involved with the industry and was a tireless lobbyist. He co-founded and headed the Thai Film Producers Association. On the night of August 17, 1970, at the Montien Hotel in Bangkok, Rattana was set to address film producers and Thai government officials in a meeting called to discuss ways of supporting the film industry. Finally, at 9 pm, after an address by Economics Minister Bunchana Atthakorn and speeches by numerous other filmmakers and officials, Rattana's time to speak came. Here is an accounting of his speech: Rattana faltered then collapsed to the floor. He was rushed to nearby Chulalongkorn Hospital, but he died three hours later of a massive coronary. Legacy Rattana's death was the first of two tough blows for the burgeoning Thai industry in 1970, for later in the year, it would lose its biggest star, Mitr Chaibancha, in a fatal accident during the filming of a stunt. A few days after Rattana's death, the government did set up the Thai Film Promotion Board, which would be responsible for promoting and encouraging investment in Thai films. But to this day there is still no direct government support for the Thai film industry and foreign films continue to dominate the domestic cinema landscape. Movies made in the Thai studio system, such as Ong- Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, fare better in local cinemas, while indie directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul are left to seek funding from overseas backers. Still, Rattana's legacy is recognizable. His films are cited as a major influence by Wisit Sasanatieng, a Thai film director whose acclaimed Tears of the Black Tiger (Fah Talai Jone) was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000. The studio that Rattana started, Hanuman Films Company, is still operated by his sons Edal and Santa. It is now called Santa International Film Productions and it provides technical support and equipment to foreign film productions. His son Santa Pestonji directed a remake of Santi-Vina in 1976. The original version of Santi-Vina was considered a lost film until prints were discovered in 2015. After restoration, it is set to be screened at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Rattana's films are periodically shown in retrospectives at film festivals. The 10th Pusan International Film Festival screened Sugar Is Not Sweet, Black Silk, Country Hotel and Dark Heaven. He was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2004 Bangkok International Film Festival. The R. D. Pestonji Award, the top prize of the Thai Short Film and Video Festival, is named in his honor. Cover from the DVD of Rattana's 1957 film, Country Hotel, available from the Thai Film Foundation.

Prior to the demonstration that depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was dependent on the cannabinoid CB1 receptor function, there was no way of producing an in vitro endocannabinoid mediated effect. Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition is classically produced in a brain slice experiment (i.e. a 300-400 ¬µm slice of brain, with intact axons and synapses) where a single neuron is \\"depolarized\\" (the normal ‚àí70 mV potential across the neuronal membrane is reduced, usually to ‚àí30 to 0 mV) for a period of 1 to 10 seconds. After the depolarization, inhibitory GABA mediated neurotransmission is reduced. This has been demonstrated to be caused by the release of endogenous cannabinoids from the depolarized neuron which diffuses to nearby neurons, and binds and activates CB1 receptors, which act presynaptically to reduce neurotransmitter release. History Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was discovered in 1992 by Vincent et al., (1992) working in purkinje cells of the cerebellum then confirmed in the hippocampus by Pitler & Alger, 1992. These groups were studying the responses of large pyramidal projection neurons to GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GABA is typically released by small interneurons in many regions of the brain, where its job is to inhibit the activity of primary neurons, such as the CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus or the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Activation of GABA receptors on these cells, whether they are ionotropic or metabotropic, typically results in the influx of chloride ions into that target cell. This build-up of negative charge from the chloride ions results in the hyperpolarization of the target cell, making it less likely to fire an action potential. Accordingly, any ionic current that hyperpolarizes a cell is called an inhibitory current. In their experiments with projection neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum, both groups noticed that a train of action potentials in these cells resulted in a temporary reduction in inhibitory currents caused by GABA-ergic interneurons. Since this reduction of inhibitory currents could be invoked simply by depolarization of the target cell, this phenomenon was termed depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. While initially discovered in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition is a pretty ubiquitous phenomenon and has been demonstrated in other areas of the brain such as the basal ganglia, the cortex, the amygdala, and the hypothalamus (Katona et al. 2001, Jo et al. 2005, Bodor et al. 2005, Matyas et al. 2006) Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition mediation by endocannabinoids Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was thought to be due to a reduction in pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release for 2 reasons. 1) The magnitudes of spontaneously evoked inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs), caused by the release of a single pre-synaptic vesicle filled with GABA, remained unchanged and 2) The cellular responses to exogenously applied GABA remained the same. These observations suggested that no changes occurred in the post-synaptic cell to change its responsiveness to GABA during depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. Somehow, depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition appeared to be mediated by a retrograde synaptic messenger whose synthesis or release was stimulated by the depolarization of the target cell. This messenger then diffused \\"backwards\\" to the pre-synaptic cell, where it caused a reduction in neurotransmitter release. The chemical messengers presumed to be responsible for mediating depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was discovered by three separate groups in 2001. Wilson & Nicoll (2001) published their work in the prestigious journal, Nature, while the other two groups, Kreitzer & Regehr (2001) and Ohno-Shosaku et al. (2001), published in the same issue of another reputable journal, Neuron. All three demonstrated heavy involvement of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, suggesting that the endocannabinoids were the brain's mediators of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. They showed that cannabinoid receptor agonists, drugs that mimic the actions of endocannabinoids or THC, could evoke the same reduction in inhibitory currents caused by depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. They also demonstrated that depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition could be prevented by cannabinoid receptor antagonists, drugs that block the actions of cannabinoid compounds. Other lines of evidence support the role of the CB1 receptor in depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. This receptor is distributed very widely throughout the brain, covering all areas where depolarization- induced suppression of inhibition has been observed (Herkenham et al. 1990). The CB1 receptor also appears to be expressed mainly on GABA-ergic pre- synaptic terminals, making it an excellent candidate for mediating depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (Matyas et al. 2006, Katona et al. 1999). In 2005, other groups began to demonstrate the involvement of the CB1 receptor in DSI in other regions of the brain (Jo et al. 2005, Bodor et al. 2005). Lastly, depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition research was finally applied to mice that had the CB1 receptor genetically \\"knocked-out\\". So far, these knock-out mice are not known to exhibit DSI in any regions of the brain, suggesting that the CB1 receptor is the crucial mediator for DSI (Kreitzer & Regehr 2001a, Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2002). The discovery that depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition is mediated by endocannabinoids finally explained why both the CB1 receptor and the endocannabinoids are both so widely distributed in the brain. Depolarization- induced suppression of inhibition is a very common form of short-term plasticity and thus needs to be mediated by a commonly found neurotransmitter. The use of endocannabinoids such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol in this method of signalling is quite logical, since both molecules can be synthesized relatively easily from lipids in the plasma membrane, a fundamental constituent of all cells. Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition is therefore the primary cortical process mediated by the endocannabinoids, and may contribute to many forms of cortical plasticity and synaptic strengthening, such as in long-term potentiation (Carlson et al. 2002). A note on depolarization-induced suppression of excitation While working with the cerebellum, Kreitzer's group also discovered that depolarization of Purkinje cells could also cause a temporary reduction in excitatory input into these cells from both climbing fibres and parallel fibres (Kreitzer et al. 2001b). This phenomenon was termed depolarization- induced suppression of excitation (DSE), and differs from DSI only by the kind of neurotransmitter whose release is reduced. In the case of DSI, the result is a reduction in inhibitory GABA release, while in DSE the effect is a reduction in excitatory glutamate release. DSE was also found to occur in other regions of the brain, however the evidence for the involvement of the endocannabinoid receptor CB1 in this process is not as solid as it is for DSI. Both DSI and DSE have been studied in the CB1 knock-out mice. Some groups show that both DSI and DSE are lacking in these mice, while others have shown that DSE, but not DSI, can still be evoked in the knock-outs (Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2002, Hajos et al. 2001). The endocannabinoids may still mediate DSE too, but by acting at a yet unknown cannabinoid receptor. Some work has shown that anandamide can bind to the vannilloid receptor VR1, the receptor responsible for mediating the effects of capsaicin. This receptor is present in the brain, and anandamide actions at this receptor may potentially contribute to DSE (Cristino et al. 2006, Hajos et al. 2002). However DSE is currently a largely unexplored phenomenon and more research is needed to draw any firm conclusions. References * *Carlson G, Wang Y, Alger BE.

The term is derived from Leki by which the Georgians knew Dagestani peoples, with the suffix ‚Äìanoba which designates attribution. The references to these raids appear in the Epic poetry of Avars; the names of rulers who lead the most devastating attacks, Umma-Khan, Nursal-Bek, and Mallachi, are mentioned in Georgian sources. The attacks began with the disintegration of the Kingdom of Georgia and the subsequent decline of its successor states in the incessant defence warfare against the Persian and Ottoman empires. In the late 16th century, part of Georgian marchlands in the Kingdom of Kakheti, later known as Saingilo, was given by the Persian shah Abbas I to his Dagestani allies, creating a base for subsequent invasions. Though chiefly of small scale, these assaults were frequent enough to be rather devastating to the fragmentised country, with the marauders taking hostages and pillaging the border settlements. From time to time, these attacks evolved into major military operations involving thousands of troops and conducted by the Dagestan feudal warlords often in alliance with either the Persians or Ottomans. Kingdom of Kakheti and Kingdom of Kartli were the two eastern Georgian kingdoms most suffered. Often taken by surprise, the Georgians failed to build up an effective defence mechanism against Lekianoba largely due to the permanent internal wars and rivalry among the Georgian polities. Furthermore, Dagestani mercenaries were frequently used by rival Georgian kings and princes against each other. In the early 1720s, the Georgian king Vakhtang VI intensified his efforts to counter the Dagestani inroads. In 1722, he decided to join his forces with the Russian tsar Peter I and mobilised a large army to campaign against the Dagestanis and their major ally, the Safavid Empire during the Russo-Persian War (1722-1723). However, Peter soon made peace with the Persians that forced Vakhtang to recall his troops. Georgia's independence finally collapsed again under the Ottoman and Persian aggression over the two subsequent decades, giving the Dagestani tribesmen more chances to attack. In 1744, Teimuraz II and his son Erekle II revived the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti from their overlord, Nader Shah, and joined their forces to check the Dagestani assaults. From 1750 to 1755, they thrice successfully repulsed a large coalition of the Dagestani clans led by the Avary khan Nursal Bek. In 1774, Erekle II created a special military force which initially, under the command of Erekle's son Levan, served an effective instrumental against the Dagestani marauds. However, facing an internal crisis in his kingdom, Erekle was unable to finally eliminate the threats from the Caucasian mountaineers. In 1785 and 1787 the Avar khan Omar twice attacked Kakheti, leaving several border villages in ruins. Beginning in 1801, with the annexation of Georgia by the Russian Empire, the Dagestani inroads weakened significantly. During the Caucasian Wars, Imam Shamil invaded the Kakhetian marches in 1854, an attack largely considered the last incident of Lekianoba.

This includes roads, bridges, state-owned railroads, airports, park and ride facilities, bicycle facilities, pedestrian paths, public transportation facilities and services, and Department of Motor Vehicles operations and motor carrier enforcement. Responsibility The federal government has provided most of the money to construct federal (Class I) highways but the state has the responsibility to maintain them. The state, in turn, builds state (Class II) roads and it is up to the local towns and municipalities to maintain them. History The Vermont State Highway Commission was established in 1892. A six-year study by the commission led to the establishment of state funding for the construction of new roads in 1898. A new State Highway Board was created in 1921 consisting of the governor and two appointed officials. Two years later, the board created the Department of Highways. In 1960, several organizations including the Commissioner of Highways, the State Highway Board, and the Board of Public Works were merged into the Department of Highways. In 1973, a Transportation Advisory Board was established and tasked with assessing all existing transportation organizations and developing a ten-year plan for state transportation. From the recommendations of the board, a new Agency of Transportation was created as the central authority of transportation in Vermont in 1975. The new agency was headed by a seven-member Transportation Board. Changes in leadership structure, divisions, and committees in 1986 established the agency as it currently stands. Structure The agency divides the state into four regions: Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast. Each region is further divided into two maintenance districts. Each maintenance district has a district headquarters. The agency's main headquarters serves an additional district, for a total of nine districts statewide. The agency employs 1,300 people and is divided into three main divisions and an associated department. They are: =Highway Division= The Highway Division is primarily responsible for the construction and maintenance of Vermont's road system. Its tasks also include installing and maintaining signals, signs, and culverts, providing grants and support for municipal level projects, maintaining the agency's fleet of vehicles, providing safety training, and informing the public of road conditions. =Division of Policy, Planning, and Intermodal Development= The PPID oversees other means of transportation in the state. Railways, airports, and public transportation are under its supervision. It is also responsible for creating future plans and prioritizing projects. It collaborates with other councils and the general public. The Vermont operations of Amtrak's Ethan Allen Express and Vermonter receive financial support. =Division of Finance and Administration= This Division performs the administrative functions of the agency. Its tasks include negotiating contracts, information technology support, budget and accounting, auditing, compliance with labor laws, and hiring. =Department of Motor Vehicles= Although not considered a division of the agency, the Vermont DMV is associated with it. The agency assists with the enforcement of DMV policy. The main headquarters are in Montpelier and there are ten other offices throughout the state. Funding In the 2020 fiscal year, the agency's total budget is $615.8 million. It includes $258 million from state transportation funding, $320 million in federal funding, $13.3 million from TIB Funds, and $24.5 million from other sources such as internal services and interdepartmental transfers. This has been appropriated as $33.2 million for the Department of Motor Vehicles, $447.7 million to the Highway Division for construction, maintenance, and municipal support, $15.5 million for Finance & Administration, and $89.2 million for Policy, Planning, and Intermodal Development. Controversy VTrans applies a salt brine to roads to melt snow and ice. The brine has been suggested as a factor in increased corrosion of vehicles. The agency states that there is no evidence to prove this. Nevertheless, a bill was introduced in the Vermont legislature in 2017 to prevent the use of salt brine. It was passed and took effect in July 2017.

The land, sometimes referenced as Dead Man's Island, Isla Del Muerto, and Reservation Point, was dredged away in 1928 as part of a harbor development effort. Rattlesnake Island, the other islet in the area, became Terminal Island. History French sea captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly visited the small islet on April 10, 1827. On its highest point, he found the eyrie of a \\"sea eagle with two eaglets\\", described as \\"black with the under part of the tail and the top of the head a yellowish white\\". From this description these were probably Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). In 1835, Richard Henry Dana, Jr. recorded in his personal narrative Two Years Before the Mast how he witnessed the brutal flogging of a shipmate by their captain in San Pedro Harbor. In his melancholy, he described Dead Man's Island as a \\"small, desolate-looking island, steep and conical...of a clayey soil on which had been buried an Englishman, the commander of a small merchant brig\\", who was rumored to have been poisoned by his crew. Dana wrote, \\"Had it been a common burying-place it would have been nothing. The single body correlated well with the solitary character of everything around. It was the only thing in California from which I could extract anything like poetry. Then, too the man had died far from home, without a friend near him...\\" On October 8, 1846, in a battle between U.S. soldiers and local Californios called the Battle of the Old Woman's Gun, as many as six American soldiers were killed.

In the latter part of the 19th century, Deadman's Island became a talking point in the free port wars during which moneyed interests debated the merits of locating a deepwater port at either San Pedro or Santa Monica Bay. Senator william B. Frye of the Senate Committee on Commerce namechecked the islet in arguing against San Pedro. \\"Deadman's Island! Rattlesnake Island! I should think it would scare a mariner to death to come into such a place! Beginning in 1928 dynamite, dredgers, and bulldozers took the island off the map to accommodate the expanded port. In the process up to two dozen skeletons were uncovered. The islet had been used as a convenient burying place for several centuries. In addition to the sailors and marines of the 1846 battle, the deceased included Black Hawk, one of the natives forcibly removed from St. Nicholas Island in 1835, two Spanish soldiers who may have lived in the 17th century, a blonde woman, and a man with an arrowhead through his head.

Spence was also a suspect in the assassination of Morgan Earp. His wife Marietta Duarte testified that Spence and several friends had talked about killing Morgan, but the judge ruled her testimony inadmissible. Spence was first suspected of robbery in 1878 in Goliad County, Texas. He was suspected of stealing mules and later a suspect in a stagecoach robbery outside Bisbee, Arizona. While a deputy sheriff, he pistol-whipped and killed a man for which he served 18 months of a five-year term before the governor pardoned him. Origins In the 1880 Tombstone census he gave his age as age 28, born in Texas, and listed his occupation as stock raiser. He was also reported as having been born in Louisiana in 1850. Little is known about his youth, but he enlisted in the Texas Rangers under Captain Wallace in 1874. From Texas to Arizona Ferguson was wanted for robbery in Goliad Co., Texas in 1878 and left the area for the Arizona Territory near Bisbee and Tombstone where he began using the name of Peter M. Spencer. He was one of a number of outlaws from Texas who sought sanctuary on the American frontier and the wild west. Locally known as Cowboys, Tombstone resident George Parson wrote in his diary, \\"A Cowboy is a rustler at times, and a rustler is a synonym for desperado‚Äîbandit, outlaw, and horse thief.\\". =Life in Tombstone= Pete Spence's house as it stands today at the corner of Fremont and 1st Street in Tombstone In Tombstone, Arizona Territory, Spence lived immediately across the street from the Earps in a house which still stands in Tombstone. For a time he ran Vogan's Saloon. In October, 1880 Spence was charged with grand larceny on a charge of possessing stolen Mexican mules, but was not convicted. Spence was a business partner of Frank Stilwell in the Franklin Mine and other mining ventures, and also in a Bisbee saloon. On August 12, 1881, he married Marietta Duarte. =Sandy Bob stage robbery= On September 8, 1881, a passenger stage on the Sandy Bob line in the Tombstone, Arizona area bound for Bisbee was held up by two masked men. They robbed all of the passengers of their valuables since the stage was not carrying a strongbox. During their robbery the driver heard one of the robbers describe the money as \\"sugar\\", a phrase known to be used by Frank Stilwell. Stilwell had until the prior month been a deputy for Sheriff Johnny Behan but had been fired for \\"accounting irregularities\\". Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp assisted by his brother Wyatt and Sheriff's posse led by Behan attempted to track the Bisbee stage robbers. At the scene of the holdup, Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels, and were able to link the boot print to Frank Stilwell. Stilwell had just arrived in Bisbee with Spence, his livery stable partner, and Virgil and Wyatt arrested both of them at the stable, for the stage robbery, on September 10. Cowboy friends provided Stilwell and Spence with an alibi, saying they were elsewhere during the robbery, and the state robbery charges were dropped. Spence and Stilwell were re-arrested on October 13 by Virgil Earp for the Bisbee robbery on a new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The Cowboys saw the Earp's filing of federal charges as further evidence they were being unfairly harassed and targeted by the Earps. They let the Earps know that they could expect retaliation. Local newspapers erroneously reported that Spence and Stilwell had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred on October 8 near Contention City. Stilwell was in jail in Tucson on these federal charges on the day of the gunfight on October 26, 1881, but Spence had been released several days before. =Role in killing Morgan Earp= At 10:50 p.m. on Saturday, March 18, 1882, Morgan Earp was shot by assailants who fired through a glass-windowed, locked door at the Campbell & Hatch Billiard Parlor in Tombstone. At the time, Morgan was playing a late round of billiards against owner Bob Hatch. The shooters narrowly missed Wyatt Earp, who was watching the game. Spence's wife, Marietta Duarte, testified at the coroner's inquest that her husband, Frank Stilwell, Frederick Bode, Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz, and a half-breed named Fries bragged about shooting Morgan. Her husband had threatened her with violence if she told what she knew. The coroner's jury concluded that Spence and his accomplices were the suspects in Morgan's assassination. When she was called to testify at Spence's preliminary hearing, the defense objected because her testimony was hearsay and because a spouse could not testify against her husband. The judge agreed and dismissed the charges. However, when Wyatt Earp learned of the coroner's jury findings, he took action on his own. After escorting the still recuperating Virgil to the rail road in Tucson, he found Frank Stilwell lying in wait and killed him. Assembling a federal posse, he set out to find and kill the remaining Cowboys whose friends' alibis or legal technicalities had gotten them off. Spence owned a ranch and woodcutting camp at South Pass in the Dragoon Mountains, where he employed Indian Charlie Cruz. Cruz was the lookout during the Morgan Earp shooting. On March 20, 1882, Wyatt Earp and a federal posse arrived at Spence's camp and asked for him. But Spence had turned himself in to Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan figuring he was safer behind bars. When the Earp posse learned Spence was in jail, they asked about Cruz. They soon found him and killed him. =Manslaughter conviction= In June 1883, Spence was working as a deputy sheriff in Georgetown, New Mexico, when he severely pistol-whipped Rodney O‚ÄôHara, killing him. He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a five-year term in the Arizona Territorial Penitentiary. Less than 18 months later he was granted a full pardon by the territorial governor. =Later life= He operated a goat ranch south of Globe, Arizona near the Galiuro Mountains with his long-time friend, Phin Clanton, and ran mule teams to bring supplies into the Globe area. Phin Clanton died in 1906, and Spence married Phin's widow four years later on April 2, 1910, using his real name of Elliot Larkin Ferguson. He died in 1914 and is buried in the Globe, Arizona cemetery, in an unmarked plot next to Phin Clanton. Screen portrayals Pete Spence was played by Michael Tolan in Hour of the Gun (1967), and by Kirk Fox in Wyatt Earp (1994).

To the right of the image is Newcastle Island. A BC Ferries ship can also be seen entering the bay, with two other ships already docked at the terminal. Departure Bay is a bay in central Nanaimo, British Columbia, on the east coast of Vancouver Island. The surrounding neighbourhood is also referred to as \\"Departure Bay\\"‚Äîonce a settlement of its own, it was amalgamated into the City of Nanaimo in the 1970s (see the history section). TOC  Geography  Jesse Island (with navigational marker). The bay is framed to the west by Vancouver Island and to the south-east by Newcastle Island, a provincial marine park with a long history of mining, quarrying, herring salteries and tourism. Jesse Island () and the smaller Brandon Island are located near the northern shore of the bay. Both islands, though quite small, have varied histories; Brandon Island being notable for a history of Japanese fish canneries and salteries. In 1853 both islands were named after sailors on HMS Virago. Snake Island is a located just outside the mouth of the bay. The \\"Departure Bay\\" neighbourhood surrounds most of the bay; though sometimes the northeastern shoreline may be referred to as \\"Hammond Bay.\\" The BC Ferry terminal (itself referred to simply as \\"Departure Bay\\") is on the southern shore of the bay. The image above-right shows a ferry which has just entered the bay turning towards the terminal.  History of the area  The earliest settlers in the region were a First Nations group known as the Snuneymuxw. It was reported in 1970 that evidence showed that the area had been inhabited for at least the whole of the last 2000 years relatively consistently.Davidson, Carole. Historic Departure Bay... Looking Back. 2006. Victoria, BC: Rendezvous Historical Press. The area was first explored by the Spanish between the 1770s and 1790s. The whole area, including Northumberland Channel, Nanaimo Harbour, and Departure Bay were named \\"Bocas de Winthuysen\\" by a Spanish naval officer, Francisco de Eliza, in 1791. The area was nonetheless referred to by the local native population as \\"Stil'ilup\\". The bay and surrounding area received an approximation of its present English moniker in approximately 1852: \\"Departure Harbour;\\" responsible for the naming were representatives of the Hudson's Bay Company. Later, in approximately 1855, maps were published showing the modern \\"Departure Bay.\\" In approximately 1861, the first known settlers of European origin made Departure Bay their home; they were William Joseph Hughes, Samuel Harris, and John and Barbara Christie. To obtain land they used what was known as \\"pre-emption,\\" a historical method the Crown used to quickly sell previously un-surveyed land. In the late 1860s, coal was discovered in the Wellington area, and Departure Bay became the terminus of the rail system shipping coal from the mines. Soon, supporting offices and wharves appeared in the area. Later, in the 1870s, coal was discovered closer to the bay itself, and the Vancouver Coal Company set up further operations in the area. As an example of the significance of this area and its commercial operations, the first phone in British Columbia was set up connecting a coal wharf in Departure Bay with the mining operations in nearby Wellington. During the development of Departure Bay, many mining companies were active in the area, including the Departure Bay Mining Company, the Harewood Coal Company, and the aforementioned Vancouver Coal Company. The Hudson's Bay Company also operated mines in the area. Early in the modern history of Departure Bay, in the decades after the first settlements in the 1860s, the area was relatively populous, due in-part to the surrounding mining operations. When the mining operations later ceased (moving further away to Extension), what was once a \\"booming little port\\" became \\"virtually uninhabited.\\" Until as late as the 1940s, the area remained a relatively insignificant neighbour of Nanaimo. In 1892‚Äîafter realizing that irrespective of the new plant in the Northfield area, demand was still increasing‚Äîthe Hamilton Powder Company built an explosives (mainly black powder, dynamite, and stumping powder) manufacturing plant on the shore of Departure Bay. The production of black powder was relatively dangerous, and the death of employees was frequently the result of accidents. Between 1974 and 1975, the community of Departure Bay was amalgamated with the City of Nanaimo, based on a popular vote of only 52 percent in favour. In actuality, 61 percent of Departure Bay residents voted against the change; nonetheless, the greater vote from the populace of Nanaimo (which was to see its personal taxes lowered as a result‚Äîwhile Departure Bay's would be likewise increased) overcame the resistance. The earliest ferries to use the port were local ships, traveling short routes between locations in the area, including Nanaimo, Departure Bay, and Newcastle Island. The first major ferry operation in the area was that of the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company, which maintained a route between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland between 1893 and 1901. In 1901, the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The route stayed in operation as the sole service until the 1950s, when the Black Ball Ferries of Captain Alexander M. Peabody's Puget Sound Navigation Company began to service the area between Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay with the ships Kahloke and Chinook. In the late 1950s, during a time of labour unrest in the industry, Premier Bennett started a governmental ferry service, then known as the British Columbia Toll Authority Ferry System. Departure Bay remained being served by the Black Ball Line until it was bought by the government ferry corporation on November 30 1961.  Present times and ferries  The BC Ferry Coastal Celebration arrives at Departure Bay on June 18, 2008, after completing a 40-day delivery voyage from Flensburg, Germany. Since the earliest European settlements, the area has been a relatively busy port, for itself and the surrounding communities. The Trans-Canada Highway on Vancouver Island terminates in the north at Departure Bay, where a B.C. Ferry terminal is located. Ferries out of Departure Bay connect the Trans-Canada Highway to the Lower Mainland at Horseshoe Bay. As a major connector to Vancouver, Departure Bay is the most heavily used Island terminal north of Swartz Bay. Whenever necessary, Departure Bay can act as a backup dock for the ferry to Gabriola Island. Between 1990 and 1997, Departure Bay was also the Island terminus for the \\"Mid-Island Express\\" route to Tsawwassen, before being replaced by the newer Duke Point terminal. Historically, before the BC Ferry Corporation took over services, Departure Bay was served by the Black Ball Ferries Kahloke and Chinook.

Squillace is situated near the east coast of Calabria, close to the shores of an extensive bay, the Gulf of Squillace (), which indents the coast of Calabria on the east as deeply as that of the Gulf of Saint Euphemia (Italian: Golfo di Sant'Eufemia) does on the west, with a comparatively narrow isthmus between them. History Squillace is known today as one of Italy's most important archaeological sites as well as a popular resort. The name derives from the ancient city of Scylletium, the principal ruins of which are located in the nearby comune of Borgia. The Roman statesman and writer Cassiodorus founded a monastery called Vivarium on his family estates on the shores of the Ionian Sea in the 6th century AD. This monastery was on the site of the modern Santa Maria de Vetere near Squillace. =Medieval and early modern history= * The modern town was founded as a Byzantine fortress during the Byzantine reconquest of Italy (6th‚Äì8th century). * During the Middle Ages it was subject to frequent raids by Saracens, who made it for a short time a strong military base. * After the brief Arab rule, the city fell under Norman hegemony. Its strategic military role, already recognised by the Greeks, was also recognised by the Normans who in 1044 built a castle and transformed the settlement into a county. * During the Kingdom of Sicily, with the lordship of Roger of Lauria, Squillace passed first to Robert of Anjou and to the counts of Monfort, then for one hundred and fifty years the city was ruled by the counts of Marzano. * In 1445, it reverted to the Aragonese Kings of Naples but passed by marriage to the infamous House of Borgia, who ruled the city as Princes of Squillace from 1494 to 1735. * Gioffre Borgia (1482-1516), son of Pope Alexander VI and younger brother of Cesare Borgia and Lucrezia Borgia, married Sancia (Sancha) of Aragon, daughter of Alfonso II of Naples. Gioffre thereby obtained both the Principality of Squillace (1494) and the Duchy of Alvito (1497) as his wife's dowry. * Although Gioffre was deprived of Alvito after the death of Sancia in 1506, he managed to retain Squillace. He subsequently married Maria de Mila, and passed it on to their son Francesco Borgia. * The Borgia Princes were: Gioffre, Francesco, Giovanni, Pietro and, finally, Anna that on whose death, paed to Francisco de Borja y Arag√≥n and last to his brother Fernando de Borja y Arag√≥n. Living either in Naples or in Spain, the Borgias ruled their fief through governors. * Under the Bourbons, Squillace was downgraded to a Marquisate and granted in 1755 to the Marquis Leopoldo de Gregorio, a nobleman from Messina who was to be the last feudal lord of Squillace. Ceramics Production of highly prized terra cotta has been an important part the local economy for centuries; Cassiodorus makes several mentions of it in his writings. Squillace is the home of the pignatari style of ceramic artistry. The name is derived from the Italian word pignata, an earthenware container used for cooking beans over an open fire.

Born in Redwood City, Clark moved with his family to Miramar Beach in Half Moon Bay when he was a young boy. He soon began surfing and seeking out bigger, stronger waves along the rugged Northern California coast. In the winter, Clark and his friends could see the large waves off Pillar Point breaking from the hillside of Half Moon Bay High School. After carefully studying the conditions, Clark paddled out at Mavericks at the age of 17, leaving behind his high school friend who declined the adventure and instead told Clark he would \\"call the Coast Guard and tell them where I last saw you.\\"Riding Giants verifies. He surfed Mavericks alone for the next 15 years before he could get others to surf it with him (although several would paddle out, none would take on the massive waves). Since then, his name has become linked to Mavericks for his dedication to the spot without wave models or water patrol. Additionally, Clark shapes his boards specifically for the conditions at Mavericks and every type of surf condition and ability. Clark is among the few ambidextrous big wave surfers in the world. Others in this category include Todd Smith and Andy Littenstall, who both also surf at Mavericks. A natural goofyfooter, Jeff spent ten years learning to ride regularfoot. This allowed him to ride frontside (facing the wave) when he started taking on the more dangerous right-breaking waves at Mavericks. Labeled one of the \\"world's best big-wave riders\\" by Surfer Magazine in 1994, Clark, along with Mavericks and the Half Moon Bay surf scene, has been featured in such films as Riding Giants and Adventures in Wild California. He is the only surfer in the San Mateo County Sports Hall of Fame. In 2015, Clark celebrated 40 years of surfing Mavericks. He continues to surf big waves, including Mavericks, and any type of wave, big or small. In the past decade, Clark has also honed his skills in Stand-Up Paddle surfing and board shaping, SUP surfing all conditions including massive waves at Mavericks. Clark founded the annual Mavericks Surf Contest with surf clothing manufacturer Quiksilver in 1998 and later joined forces with Evolve Sports, a San Francisco-based sports marketing group. Most recently, a small group of Half Moon Bay surfers and business owners joined together to organize and present the contest, and in 2014 formed a licensing agreement with Cartel Management for the promotion, branding and sponsorships of the event. The contest is now known as Titans of Mavericks. Clark is recognized as one of the premier big wave surfboard shapers in the country and shapes a full line of custom surfboards and SUPs -- personally testing every model in the conditions for which they are designed. He owns Mavericks Surf Company and a new shop, Mavericks PaddleSports, in the Princeton Harbor neighborhood of Half Moon Bay, not far from the break. Clark holds a patent in surfboard design and developed and now produces with Quatic the Clark Inflatable Life Vest for extreme water sports safety. Clark often travels to pursue big waves, and often gives motivational speeches for groups and companies. Fans often encounter Jeff at his family-run shops in Half Moon Bay and meets with surfers to design custom boards.

Droperidol is also often used as a sedative in intensive-care treatment.  History  Discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961, droperidol is a butyrophenone which acts as a potent D2 (dopamine receptor) antagonist with some histamine and serotonin antagonist activity. Medical use It has a central antiemetic action and effectively prevents postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults using doses as low as 0.625 mg. For treatment of nausea and vomiting, droperidol and ondansetron are equally effective; droperidol is more effective than metoclopramide. It has also been used as an antipsychotic in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg given as an intramuscular injection, generally in cases of severe agitation in a psychotic patient who is refusing oral medication. Its use in intramuscular sedation has been replaced by intramuscular preparations of haloperidol, midazolam, clonazepam and olanzapine. Some practitioners recommend the use of 0.5 mg to 1 mg intravenously for the treatment of vertigo in an otherwise healthy elderly patients who have not responded to Epley maneuvers.  Black box warning  In 2001, the FDA changed the labeling requirements for droperidol injection to include a Black Box Warning, citing concerns of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. The evidence for this is disputed, with 9 reported cases of torsades in 30 years and all of those having received doses in excess of 5 mg. QT prolongation is a dose-related effect, and it appears that droperidol is not a significant risk in low doses. A study in 2015 showed that droperidol is relatively safe and effective for the management of violent and aggressive adult patients in hospital emergency departments in doses of 10mg and above and that there was no increased risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.  Side effects  Dysphoria, sedation, hypotension resulting from peripheral alpha adrenoceptor blockade, prolongation of QT interval which can lead to torsades de pointes, and extrapyramidal side effects such as dystonic reactions/neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Chemistry Droperidol is synthesized from 1-benzyl-3-carbethoxypiperidin-4-one, which is reacted with o-phenylenediamine. Evidently, the first derivative that is formed under the reaction conditions, 1,5-benzodiazepine, rearranges into 1-(1-benzyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-piridyl)-2-benzymidazolone. Debenzylation of the resulting product with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst, and subsequent alkylation of this using 4-chloro-4'-fluorobutyrophenone yields droperidol. 600px *C. Janssen, NV Res.

Kai's Power Tools were sold to Corel when MetaCreations was closed. The phrase Kai's Power Tools is often abbreviated to KPT. There are various versions of Kai's Power Tools. KPT 3, 5, 6, and X sets are compilations of different filters. The program interface features a reward-based function in which a bonus function is revealed as the user moves towards more complex aspects of the tool.  Filters  The KPT Convolver is a mathematics based filter; the level of precision and varying effects can be achieved by using numerical values of colour, tint, hue, saturation, contrast, brightness, luminosity, and posterize. The KPT Projector takes the current image or selection and offers a number of interactive perspective warp effects. To a large extent, with its draggable distortion handles and its moving, scaling and rotating options, this simply duplicates Adobe Photoshop's Free Transform capabilities. What is completely different is the ability to rotate the bitmap image in 3D space and to tile the results if desired. It can also animate the distortions by dragging keyframes from the preview window into an animation palette. KPT 6 will then preview the animation and output it to various sizes in avi or mov format. This animation capability is even more useful with the KPT Turbulence filter. This is another distortion filter, but one that treats the image as if it was completely liquid. The preview panel shows the animation in real time. The KPT Goo filter is used to produce a single frame freeform liquid distortion. This filter is available both with KPT 6 and the standalone version. It works by effectively turning a bitmap image into a liquid that can be interactively smeared, smudged, twirled, and pinched with the range of tools on offer. The obvious use is to distort photographic portraits into caricatures. KPT Materializer can create advanced surface textures based on bump maps that define troughs and peaks. It can use any external image for the basis of the bump map or alternatively the user can pick out the hue, saturation, luminance or red, green, or blue channel of the current image. It can then offset, scale and rotate the texture map, control its lighting, and even blend in a reflection map. The filter can be used for anything from providing an oil-painting feel to an entire image, to giving the illusion of depth to a selection. Also producing the impression of depth is the KPT Gel filter which uses various paint tools to synthesize photo-realistic 3D materials such as metals, liquids, or plastics. Gel painting is very different from traditional 2D painting as the brush strokes pool together when they touch and refract the underlying image. It can also manipulate 3D paint‚Äîonce it has been added‚Äîby twirling, pinching, and carving it. The opposite is true of the Equalizer filter, which is used for applying variations on sharpening effects. The filter has three modes. The first mode, Equalizer, looks and works rather like the graphic equalizer on a stereo system, enabling adjustment of the level of pixel contrast within nine bands of different visual frequencies. The second mode, Contrast Sharpen, allows for increasing the contrast between light and dark areas in an image. The third mode, Bounded Sharpen, can sharpen an image without causing oversharpening, which can lead to halo effects. This feature is particularly useful when pulling out the detail in an image softened by resizing. KPT SceneBuilder is used for producing photorealistic 3D scenes by importing and rendering 3DS files. The main image window offers three tabs for editing in 2D and 3D mode and for setting up the object's final texture. Many users regard this filter as being the most impressive because it acts as a standalone 3D rendering tool and provides control over everything from transparency, reflection, refraction, bump mapping through to multiple light sources, and so on but without the ability to create or edit objects. The final filter, KPT SkyEffects, also has its roots in Metacreations' experience with 3D programs such as Bryce and RayDream. This filter is designed to simulate the interaction between the light from the sun or moon with no less than six atmospheric layers of haze, fog and cloud. The filter is typical of the KPT 6 collection as a whole: at times the interface is inspired and offers the ability to create beautiful reddening sunsets simply by interactively dragging the sun toward the horizon, producing realistic sunsets and moonscapes. Other effects Kai's Power Tools 6 features a lens flare effect for precisely managing the type of glow, halo, streaks, and reflection. The addition of a library of preset effects helps to overcome this by allowing the user to choose a standard effect and then interactively position the flare in the image preview. KPT 6 provides a new engine in the form of the KPT Reaction, which takes a reaction seed and turns it into a seamlessly tiling pattern based on a reaction diffusion process. It offers random noise, regular dots or reticulated voronoi patterns or a bitmap image itself as the seed. Corel has no plans for any updates.

Built in 1769 and extensively reworked in 1798, it is one of Vermont's oldest surviving houses, and an important example of evolutionary architecture in the state during the 18th century. Now a bed and breakfast inn, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Henry House is located outside the village of North Bennington, Vermont, on the south side of the Walloomsac River, just south of the Burt Henry Covered Bridge. It is set on of meadow, maple and pine. The main block of the house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with gabled roof and clapboard siding. Extending to the north and rear are ells, one of which appears to be a porch that was enclosed at a relatively early date. A two-story porch extends across the east side, supported by massive square posts. The interior of the main block has nearly intact finishes, including flooring, woodwork, door hinges and other hardware, although some parts were recycled from other old buildings during a 1930s restoration. The house was built in 1769 for Elnathan Hubbell, and was extensively altered for William Henry about 1797. The Henrys were prominent in the settlement and politics of southwestern Vermont for many years, with Henry's son representing the state in the United States Congress. The house was built just eight years after settlement began in the area, and is one of the state's oldest surviving buildings. The fact that it was altered in the 18th century is also important, as it provides a window into changing construction methods. It was the birthplace of Horace Chapin Henry, an early Seattle businessman. The house is now operated as the Henry House Inn, a bed and breakfast establishment.

Biography =Early years= Montgomery was born and grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of James Montgomery, a professional operatic tenor of Scottish descent. His mother, Constance, was also musical.Hughes, Samuel. \\"Monty in Full\\", The Pennsylvania Gazette, April 28, 2000, accessed July 13, 2018 He had a brother, James, and two sisters, Elizabeth and Constance. He showed early enthusiasm for opera and appeared in the Philadelphia Orchestra Opera Company‚Äôs production of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera Trial by Jury at the age of five. He also wrote songs as early as age five. His parents took him out of school each Friday to hear the Philadelphia Orchestra at the Academy of Music. Montgomery graduated from Germantown Friends School in 1945, and he earned his bachelor's degree in painting and music composition in 1950 from Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas. For his senior project, he wrote and starred in a musical comedy. =Career= Montgomery began his career at the University of Pennsylvania in 1950 as an assistant director of the Cultural Olympics, a yearly event sponsored by the university that featured amateur performing artists.\\"Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\" , pp. 3‚Äì4, University of Pennsylvania, May 11, 2000, accessed December 2, 2011 In 1951, he was drafted and sent to Korea to serve in the 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army during the Korean War. This experience inspired him to write Why Me? in 1967, a musical set in the Korean War, and Herodotus Fragments for symphony orchestra and two choruses, which the Philadelphia Orchestra first performed in 1970. While serving in the Korean War, Montgomery had occasion to entertain troops in Japan. In 1955, he served for a year as assistant to Penn's director of public relations. Montgomery was appointed director of musical activities at the University of Pennsylvania in 1956. Also in 1956, Montgomery took over as director of the Penn Glee Club and served in that position for 44 years until his retirement in 2000, writing, directing, choreographing and conducting their shows, and bringing the glee club on tours to 30 countries on five continents. He published a memoir in 2005 entitled Brothers, Sing On!: My Half-Century Around The World With The Penn Glee Club through University of Pennsylvania Press, relating many of his favorite stories from his tenure and travels as director of the Glee Club, as well as reminiscences about his Gilbert and Sullivan activities.Brothers, Sing On!, University of Pennsylvania Press, accessed July 13, 2018 For the Glee Club, Montgomery composed the \\"Academic Festive Anthem\\", using words by Benjamin Franklin.

By 1980, he was head of 10 musical groups at the university, retiring from most of them in 2000. His only remaining official position at Penn as of 2008 was directing the Penn Singers' spring shows. Montgomery's father founded the Philadelphia Gilbert & Sullivan Players in 1950, and Montgomery took over the group upon his father's death in 1955. He remained the group's Artistic Director for over three decades. Under his guidance, the group produced over 65 productions. He then served as stage director for the Gilbert & Sullivan Society of Chester County in West Chester, Pennsylvania from 1987 until 2007. He both directed and performed in each of the 14 Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Montgomery was also a composer and lyricist whose works have been performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, and many other performing groups. He also provided occasional narration at Philadelphia Orchestra performances.

He made a fortune in the trucking industry and was known for his lavish lifestyle. He eventually lost his fortune because of a gambling addiction and alcoholism. Early years Tose's father, a Russian Jewish immigrantGQ Magazine: \\"Leonard Tose\\" September 17, 2012 to the United States, settled outside Philadelphia and was a peddler with a pack on his back. He eventually owned 10 trucks, the beginning of the family business. Eventually, Tose Inc. owned more than 700 trucks and grossed $20 million a year. Tose was born in Bridgeport, Pennsylvania and graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1937. Philadelphia Eagles owner Tose, a lifelong fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, invested in the team as a member of the \\"Happy Hundred,\\" a group led by James P. Clark. Tose invested $3,000 as one of the one hundred owners to purchase the team from Alexis Thompson on January 15, 1949. Tose tried to buy the team with his own group of investors in 1956, but was unable to do so. The team was bought in December 1963 by Jerry Wolman for $5,505,000 and Tose received more than $60,000. He bought the team from Wolman in 1969 for $16,155,000, then a record for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire head coach Joe Kuharich. He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great Pete Retzlaff as general manager and Jerry Williams as coach. In 1976, he, along with General Manager Jimmy Murray, lured Dick Vermeil from UCLA to coach the hapless Eagles, who had one winning season from 1962‚Äì1975. Vermeil's 1980 team lost to Oakland in the Super Bowl. In January 1983, Tose announced that his daughter, Susan Fletcher, the Eagles' vice president and legal counsel, would eventually succeed him as primary owner of the Eagles. In 1985, after a failed attempt to swap franchises with Ralph Wilson (whose Buffalo Bills were then under severe distress), Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to Norman Braman and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65 million to pay off his more than $25 million in gambling debts at Atlantic City casinos.  After the Eagles  In 1991, the Sands sued him for $1.23 million in gambling debts. He countersued, contending that the casino got him too drunk to know what he was doing. Eventually, the casino won. There was testimony from a cocktail waitress swearing that her job description was \\"to keep Mr. Tose's glass filled.\\" The casino provided a monogrammed glass which she was instructed to keep filled with top-shelf scotch. In the end, he lost it all, by his estimate more than $20 million at Resorts International and $14 million at the Sands. In 1996, on his 81st birthday, Tose was evicted from his seven-bedroom Villanova mansion after losing the house in a U.S. Marshal's sale. In 1999, he told a congressional hearing on compulsive gambling that his losses totaled between $40 million and $50 million. He spent his last years alone in a downtown hotel room after his home in Philadelphia's upscale Main Line district was confiscated for unpaid taxes. Mr. Tose died in his sleep in the hospice wing of St. Agnes Medical Center in Philadelphia on April 15, 2003. He was 88. No cause of death was released. An obituary by Dan Dunkin captured his life: \\"To put Leonard Tose's life in football terms, he threw on every down.\\" Personal life Tose had been married five times.

Tose flew to Eagles home games in a helicopter, was married aboard the liner Queen Elizabeth 2 and fed reporters filet mignon and shrimp cocktail. During his tenure as Eagles owner, Tose was instrumental in helping establish the first Ronald McDonald House.

He was the son of Norway's most successful football coach, Nils Arne Eggen. Career Eggen was born on 1 November 1960 in Orkdal, to football player Nils Arne Eggen and Karin Pauline Eggen (1940‚Äì2011),http://www.seher.no/866260/nils-arne-eggen-mistet-kona as the first of three children. He began his youth career in the local club Orkdal IL, before moving on to Rosenborg in 1978, where his father was the head coach. He won the league three times and the Norwegian Cup two times with Rosenborg, where he spent his entire professional career until he retired in 1991, aged 31. He also competed for Norway at the 1984 Summer Olympics and was capped four times in total for Norway. =Coaching career= After Eggen retired as a player, he started to work as an assistant coach in Rosenborg from 1992 to 1993. He then moved to Aalesund in 1994, where he started his career as a head coach. After three years in Aalesund, he followed in his father's footsteps in Moss, where they won promotion to Tippeligaen in his first season. Moss stayed in Tippeligaen under Eggen's command, and after the 2001-season he became coach of another club from √òstfold, the old giants, Fredrikstad FK. The old giants, with nine league championships and ten cup championships, had been playing at the third tier for nine straight seasons when Eggen was hired in 2001. They won promotion to the First Division in 2002 and Eliteserien in 2003. In 2005, former national team coach Egil Olsen was hired as head coach for Fredrikstad, while Knut Torbj√∏rn Eggen stepped down to work as an assistant coach. When Olsen retired from the position at the end of the year, due to health issues, Eggen was once again promoted to his previous job. In 2006, he led the team to eighth place in the Premier Division, their highest placing so far, and also led the team to gold in the Norwegian Championship Cup that year, in what would be his final match with the club. After this very successful season, Eggen quit his job in Fredrikstad in December 2006, after several major disagreements with new club director Morgan Andersen. After leaving his job in Fredrikstad, Eggen was appointed as new club director in Rosenborg, after long-time director Rune Bratseth had resigned from the position. He only held that position for a year, before he returned to Moss FK to work in youth development as a coach in 2007. In 2008, he was appointed head of this department. He left this job in early 2010 to take over the coaching duties of the Norwegian under-19 national team. During his later years, he also worked frequently as a commentator and match analyst with Norwegian TV channel Viasat 4 as part of the channel's coverage of the UEFA Champions League. Personal life Outside of football, Eggen was (like his father) a teacher by education, and he also held a degree in football coaching, the only coach in the Premier Division to have such during his time there. Eggen struggled with anxiety disorder for most of his life, and came public with his struggles in 1988, when he admitted that he did not play the Norwegian Cup final that year because of his anxiety issues. He also did a number of interviews about living with the disease. Eggen was found dead in his own home on 20 February 2012.

Hawley & Hazel was established in Shanghai in 1933 and later based in Taiwan (1949) and Hong Kong (1973). In 1985, Colgate-Palmolive acquired 50% of Hawley & Hazel. Naming Hawley and Hazel marketed Darkie toothpaste as a parody of an American minstrel performer, Al Jolson, who became popular for his blackface performances. The whiteness of his teeth inspired the brand name and logo. Darky, or darkie, is a racist term used primarily in the Western World to refer to black people. The packaging featured an image of a wide-eyed, white man in blackface, wearing a top hat, monocle and bow-tie, an image associated with minstrel shows.Al Jolson, the comedian who inspired the logo design In 1985, after Colgate-Palmolive acquired 50% of Hawley & Hazel, great controversy erupted over the brand in the United States, to which Colgate- Palmolive CEO Ruben Mark responded by issuing an apology and replacing the English name of the toothpaste to \\"Darlie\\" in 1989, and altering the image on the packaging to show a racially ambiguous face in a top hat to avoid racial misunderstanding.

He both wrote and illustrated those picture books, as well as Fables, for which he won the 1981 Caldecott Medal recognizing the year's best-illustrated U.S. picture book. Lobel also illustrated the works of other writers, including Sam the Minuteman by Nathaniel Benchley, published in 1969. Biography Lobel was born in Los Angeles, California, to Lucille Stark and Joseph Lobel, but was raised in Schenectady, New York. Lobel's childhood was not a happy one, as he was frequently bullied, but he did love reading picture books at his local library. He attended the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. In 1955, after he graduated, he married Anita Kempler, also a children's writer and illustrator whom he'd met while in art school. The two worked in the same studio and collaborated on several books together.Serafin, Steven R. \\"LOBEL, Arnold.\\" Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature, Letter L, pp. 494-496. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=lkh&AN;=18766042&site;=lrc- plus. They had two children: daughter Adrianne and son Adam Lobel, and three grandchildren. Following college, Lobel was unable to support himself as a children's book author or illustrator and so he worked in advertising and trade magazines, which he did not like. In 1974, he told his family that he was gay. In the early 1980s, he and Anita separated, and he moved Greenwich Village. He died of cardiac arrest on December 4, 1987, at Doctors Hospital in New York, after suffering from AIDS for some time. Writing and illustrating Lobel loved his work, saying \\"I cannot think of any work that could be more agreeable and fun than making books for children\\" and described his job as a daydreamer. Lobel began drawing during a period of extended illness as a second grader. His professional career began during the 1960s, writing and illustrating \\"conventional\\" easy readers and fables. His style could be described as minimalist and frequently had animals as the subject matter. Lobel used animals as characters because he felt it helped with the suspension of disbelief. Joseph Stanton, writing in The Journal of American Culture, argues that Lobel's style was \\"timid\\" before Lobel started writing easy readers. His second book, A Holiday for Mister Muster, and perhaps others were inspired by the Prospect Park Zoo in Brooklyn, which the Lobels lived across the street from. Cartoons his children watched were also an inspiration, as were popular television shows like Bewitched and The Carol Burnett Show. Lobel's writing and illustrations went through several phases in his career. His early works had a broad humor often in verse, a style that he would return to at other points in his career. In 1977 interview for The Lion and the Unicorn, Lobel explained that he wrote these books by imagining what children would want to read. However, as he continued to write, he realized the books he was writing didn't have the \\"weight\\" to them he wished and that he was going to have to use tap into himself in order to create better writing. Following that epiphany, he began taking inspiration from his own experiences and emotions, and acknowledged that he was writing \\"... adult stories, slightly disguised as children's stories.\\" In the 1970s Lobel's illustrations shifted from primary colors to a broader spectrum of pastel colors. The solitary individual, whether played seriously or for comic relief, was common in Lobel's work, as were two people who were complementary. Lobel's illustrations served to visualize the rhythm and emotions of the text in a way that could be \\"cinematic.\\"Shannon, George. \\"Writing the Empty Cup: Rhythm and Sound as Content.\\" Children's Literature, vol. 19, 1991, pp. 138‚Äì147. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/chl.0.0452 Lobel's chosen vocabulary, subject matter, and writing style helped to re-conceive what an easy reader book could be. Lobel identified the exploration of his own feelings as a reason that he improved as a writer. In his 1977 The Lion and the Unicorn interview, Lobel discussed the ways he would work through his emotions while still maintaining his children's audience. This was part of Lobel's belief that adult and children emotions were more similar than different. His work was described as \\"sunny, warm, even cosy.\\" Despite this, the process of writing was \\"painful\\" for Lobel, who was far more inclined to want to illustrate than write and only started writing because of the increased royalties.Natov, Roni & Deluca, Geraldine. \\"An Interview with Arnold Lobel.\\" The Lion and the Unicorn, vol. 1 no. 1, 1977, pp. 72‚Äì96. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/uni.0.0119 As late as 1983, Lobel felt he was beginning to trust his instincts as a writer.Rollin, L. Child Lit Educ (1984) 15: 191. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01137182 In fact, he never felt comfortable enough with his technical writing skill to consider writing a novel for adults, or a longer book for children. Lobel illustrated close to 100 books during his career which were translated into dozens of languages. Despite the awards he won, Lobel wasn't always recognized during his lifetime. Frog and Toad series Comprising four books, the Frog and Toad series tells tales of the two eponymous friends. Lobel felt his personality was reflected in the two characters, saying \\"Frog and Toad are really two aspects of myself.\\" The marked contrast between the \\"adventurous\\" Frog and the \\"bumbling\\" Toad is part of what made their relationship believable and endearing.Bader, Barbara. \\"Five Gay Picture‚ÄìBook Prodigies and the Difference They've Made.\\" Horn Book Magazine, vol. 91, no. 2, Mar/Apr2015, pp. 24-32.

His daughter Adrianne has suggested that the friendship between the two characters was really a beginning of Lobel's own coming out, though this connection is not something Lobel publicly discussed. The strong friendship between Frog and Toad has been identified as an important reason for their success with children, along with their \\"vaudevillian\\" relationship.Russell, David L.\\"The Important Books: Children's Picture Books as Art and Literature (review).\\" The Lion and the Unicorn, vol. 30 no. 2, 2006, pp. 280‚Äì283. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/uni.2006.0025 Fables The book Fables is composed of approximately 20 fables featuring animal protagonists. The book was praised for its ability to combine a cheerful (rather than moralistic) tone with an actual moral at the end of each story. It received the Caldecott Medal for its illustrations in 1981, Lobel's first win and third overall recognition. Awards Lobel is among a small group of people who have been honored as both an author and illustrator for the Newbery and Caldecott medals. Lobel won the 1981 Caldecott from the American Library Association, recognizing Fables as the year's best-illustrated U.S. children's picture book. His work won the Caldecott Honor in 1971 and 1972 for Frog and Toad are Friends and Hildilid's Night. He won a Newbery Honor Award in 1973 for Frog and Toad Together (1972). He won the Garden State Children's Book Award from the New Jersey Library Association for Mouse Soup (1977). He was also recognized by the National Education Association, the American Library Association, the Boys‚Äô Club, the Society of Children‚Äôs Book Writers, and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Foundation.

The word KƒÅpƒÅlikas is derived from kapƒÅla meaning \\"skull\\", and KƒÅpƒÅlikas means the \\"skull-men\\". The KƒÅpƒÅlikas traditionally carried a skull-topped trident (khatvanga) and an empty skull as a begging bowl. Other attributes associated with KƒÅpƒÅlikas were that they smeared their body with ashes from the cremation ground, revered the fierce Bhairava form of Shiva, and engaged in rituals with blood, meat, alcohol, and sexual fluids. According to David Lorenzen, there is a paucity of primary sources on Kapalikas, and historical information about them is available from fictional works and other traditions who disparage them. Various Indian texts claim that the KƒÅpƒÅlika drank liquor freely, both for ritual and as a matter of habit. The Chinese pilgrim to India in the 7th century, Hsuan Tsang, in his memoir on what is now northwest Pakistan, wrote about Buddhists living with naked ascetics who cover themselves with ashes and wore bone wreathes on their heads, but Hsuan Tsang does not call them Kapalikas or any particular name. Scholars have interpreted these ascetics variously as Digambara Jains, Pashupatas and Kapalikas. The KƒÅpƒÅlikas were more of a monastic order, states Lorenzen, and not a sect with a textual doctrine. The KƒÅpƒÅlika tradition gave rise to the KulamƒÅrga, a category of tantric Shaivism which preserves some of the distinctive features of the KƒÅpƒÅlika tradition.Sanderson, Alexis. \\"The ≈öaiva Literature.\\" Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 & 25 (2012‚Äì2013), 2014, pp.4-5, 11, 57.

Kennedy from 1961 until Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. O'Donnell was a close friend of President Kennedy and his younger brother Robert F. Kennedy, and was part of the group of Kennedy's close advisers dubbed the ‚ÄúIrish Mafia.‚Äù O'Donnell also served as an aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson from 1963 to 1965. He later served as an adviser to Robert Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Early life O'Donnell was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and raised in Boston. Both of his parents were Catholics of Irish descent. He was the son of Alice M. (Guerin) and Cleo Albert O'Donnell, who was the football coach at the College of the Holy Cross Crusaders for two decades, and later athletics director for all sports activities. O'Donnell's older brother, also named Cleo, was a football star at Harvard during the 1940s. Following graduation from Harvard, O'Donnell attended law school at Boston College from 1950‚Äì51. He later worked as a salesman for the Hollingsworth & Vose Paper Company and then the Whitney Corporation, both in Boston, from 1951 to 1952. O'Donnell later worked in public relations from 1952 to 1957. O'Donnell graduated from high school during World War II and then served in the U.S. Army Air Forces (1942‚Äì1945), where he flew 30 missions as a bombardier in a B-17 squadron before being shot down over Belgium. \\"He was imprisoned, escaped, and emerged with the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal with Four Oak Leaf Clusters.\\"Johnson, Haynes, \\"Kenneth O'Donnell, Kennedy White House Aide, Dies\\", The Washington Post, Washington, D.C., Saturday 10 September 1977. Following the war, he studied at Harvard College (1946‚Äì1949) and met Robert F. Kennedy, where they were roommates as well as teammates on the Harvard football team; O'Donnell became team captain in 1948. The two remained close friends until Kennedy's assassination in 1968.Washington Post: Political Junkie, January 26, 2001 Retrieved 2010-02-26 Career O'Donnell's friendship with Robert Kennedy led to his involvement with the Kennedy family's political careers. In 1946, Robert Kennedy enlisted him to work on the first congressional campaign of his elder brother, John F. Kennedy. In 1952, O'Donnell and Robert Kennedy campaigned together to get John elected to the U.S. Senate. O'Donnell then went on to serve as John Kennedy's unpaid political observer in Massachusetts, until 1957, when he became assistant counsel to Senate Labor Rackets Committee, where he worked for Robert Kennedy, who had been appointed chief counsel of the Committee. In 1958, O'Donnell became a member of Senator John Kennedy's staff, where he was later a key organizer and adviser during Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1960. The following year, he became President Kennedy's special assistant and Appointments Secretary. He later advised the President during the lead up to the Bay of Pigs invasion and during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. O'Donnell arranged President Kennedy's trip to Dallas in November 1963 and was in a car just behind the president's limousine when Kennedy was assassinated. Kennedy's death was an enormous blow to O'Donnell, who long blamed himself for the assassination. On May 18, 1964, O'Donnell provided testimony to Norman Redlich and Arlen Specter, assistant counsel for the Warren Commission. O'Donnell stated that it was his impression that the shots fired at Kennedy came from the right rear. In their memoir of Kennedy, Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye, both O'Donnell and David Powers reported hearing only three shots and did not offer any speculation as to their origin. According to a June 15, 1975 report in the Chicago Tribune, an unnamed \\"Central Intelligence Agency liaison man\\" told Congressman that O'Donnell and David Powers had initially told assassination investigators that the shots that struck Kennedy came from a location other than the Texas School Book Depository, but that the two men were convinced, reportedly by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover or his top aides, to alter their accounts to the Warren Commission to avoid the possibility of revealing the CIA's plots to kill Fidel Castro which might lead to an international incident. Responding in a telephone interview, O'Donnell said he testified truthfully and called the allegations \\"an absolute, outright lie.\\" In his 1987 autobiography Man of the House, former House Speaker Tip O'Neill wrote that he had dinner with O'Donnell and Powers in 1968, and that both men indicated that two shots were fired from behind the fence on the grassy knoll at Dealey Plaza. According to O'Neill, he pointed out to O'Donnell that he gave different information to the Warren Commission, and O'Donnell replied: \\"I told the FBI what I had heard, but they said it couldn't have happened that way and that I must have been imagining things. So I testified the way they wanted me to. I just didn't want to stir up any more pain and trouble for the family.\\" After serving as a presidential aide to Lyndon Johnson until early 1965, O'Donnell resigned in order to try to win the Democratic nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1966. However, he lost by 64,000 votes to Edward McCormack in a race that was much closer than the polls had predicted. In 1968, he served as campaign manager for Robert Kennedy in his bid for the presidency. Robert Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, was a more devastating blow to O'Donnell than the assassination of President Kennedy five years earlier. He soon joined, as did many others in Kennedy's campaign, Hubert Humphrey's presidential campaign, serving as campaign manager. In 1970, he made another attempt to win the Democratic nomination for governor, but finished fourth in a field of four Democrats, with just nine percent of the vote. In 1972, O'Donnell and David Powers co-authored a book about President Kennedy,\\"Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye\\": Memories of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Marriages and children While at Harvard, O'Donnell married Helen Sullivan in 1947. They had five children: Kenneth Jr., twins Kathleen and Kevin, Mark and Helen. In January 1977, his wife Helen died of the effects of alcoholism. He remarried shortly after that to Asta Hanna Helga Steinfatt, a native of Germany. O'Donnell died a few months later. Death In the years following the assassinations of President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, O'Donnell grew increasingly depressed and began drinking heavily. His depression and alcoholism were exacerbated by the failure of his own political career. On August 11, 1977, O'Donnell was admitted to Beth Israel Hospital in Boston for a gastrointestinal ailment brought on from the effects of alcoholism. His condition grew progressively worse. He died on September 9 at the age of 53. At the request of O'Donnell's family, no cause of death was publicly announced. O'Donnell's younger daughter, Helen, later attributed her father's death to alcoholism. On September 12, 1977, a funeral mass was held at the Blessed Sacrament Roman Catholic Church in Jamaica Plain. Among the attendees were former mayor of Boston John F. Collins, former Speaker of the House John William McCormack, and several members of the Kennedy family, including President Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Assessments =Praise= In his biography With Kennedy (1966), Pierre Salinger writes: =Criticism= In his autobiography Counselor, Ted Sorensen, who served as special counsel to President Kennedy, claimed that O'Donnell polarized the JFK staff until it became two factions: the professional \\"politicians\\" and the academics (such as Sorensen and Arthur Schlesinger). Sorensen also wrote that O'Donnell's antipathy towards him was so deep that in 1976/77 he worked to derail Sorensen's nomination as Director of Central Intelligence for Jimmy Carter. Memoir In 1998, William Morrow & Co. published A Common Good: The Friendship of Robert F. Kennedy and Kenneth P. O'Donnell. The memoir was written by O'Donnell's daughter, freelance writer Helen O'Donnell, and chronicles her father's close friendship with Robert Kennedy.

In media such as television and film, the device is an opportunity for two actors to temporarily play each other's characters, although in some cases, dialogue is dubbed by the original actors. There are different types of body swapping. For non-technology swapping, switches can be caused by magic items such as amulets, heartfelt wishes, or just strange quirks of the universe. The switches typically reverse after the subjects have expanded their world views, gained a new appreciation for each other's troubles by literally \\"walking in another's shoes\\" and/or caused sufficient amounts of farce. Notable examples include the books Vice Versa (1882) and Freaky Friday (1972), as well as the film versions of both. Switches accomplished by technology, exempting gadgets advanced sufficiently to appear as magic, are the fare of mad scientists. Body-swapping devices are usually characterized by a highly experimental status, straps, helmets with many complicated cables that run to a central system and a tendency to direly malfunction before their effects can be reversed. Those without such means may resort to brain transplants. Such experiments can have overtones of horror. Appearances in fiction and drama Since the Vice Versa novel was published in 1882, body swaps have been a popular theme in various media: * Boy Meets Girl (2009 TV miniseries) ‚Äì Two strangers swap bodies when struck by lightning. *The Change-Up (2011 film) ‚Äì A lawyer and family man switches with his best friend who is an adult video actor. * Dating the Enemy (1996 film) ‚Äì An Australian comedy about a boyfriend and girlfriend who swap bodies and have to live as each other. * Freaky Friday (1972 book) ‚Äì Mother and daughter. Disney produced a film in 1976 and remakes in 1995 and 2003. Several television shows have used Freaky Friday or variants of for their episode titles. This also inspired the Freaky Freakend sitcom block where several TV shows on Disney Channel featured body swapping episodes. *The Hot Chick (2002 film) ‚Äì A popular high school cheerleader finds herself in a man's body. *The Identity Matrix (1982 novel by Jack L.

Berrien was named after counties in Georgia and Michigan. She was launched 20 March 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Wilmington, California; acquired by the Navy on 7 October 1944; and commissioned on 8 October 1944, with Lieutenant Commander John Murray Gallagher USNR in command. The ship was nicknamed the \\"Mighty B\\" and the \\"Blue Bitch\\". Operational history =World War II= Invasion of Iwo Jima She departed Pearl Harbor for operations in the Pacific on 27 January 1945. Berrien arrived in time to participate in the invasion of Iwo Jima. It was during this campaign, on the night of 21 February 1945, that the ship was hit by an artillery shell on her after deckhouse. Seventeen of the crew were wounded and received the Purple Heart medal. Invasion of Okinawa Approximately one month later, the ship was again on her way into enemy territory with Transport Squadron 15 as part of the invasion of Okinawa. On Easter Sunday morning, the Berrien and other ships of the task force appeared off the southwest shores of Okinawa as part of a feint to throw enemy forces off balance and pave the way for the main landings on the western beaches of Hagushi. That morning, 2 U.S. Navy ships were hit by kamikaze planes. However, the feint succeeded and it was used again the next day. This worked well and losses were minimal. The Berrien cruised offshore for about a week, waiting orders to proceed to Hagushi to unload her cargo. She was finally sent into enemy waters, accompanied by a destroyer escort and the destroyers USS Ammen and USS Brown. While en route, Berrien encountered a mine and had near misses by 4 torpedoes fired by a Japanese submarine. She arrived at Okinawa and remained there for 10 days, during which she was under constant attack from shore batteries and kamikazes. She received a hit near her stacks which wounded a radioman, making him the 18th Berrien crewman to receive the Purple Heart. Air-sea rescue From Okinawa, she sailed back to Saipan, and received orders to head to the South Pacific. The crew was initiated from 'pollywogs' into respectable 'shellbacks' at the Equator. From Tulagi she steamed to Noumea, New Caledonia, then back to the Mariana Islands. On the morning of 3 July, on the way into Guam, she participated in the air-sea rescue of 10 downed Army fliers. From Guam she returned to the US. While in San Francisco, the cease fire order was given in the Pacific theater. The war had ended. =After hostilities= Berrien returned to the Pacific and headed to Manila, then to Aomori, Japan as part of the initial allied landings in northern Honsh≈´. From there, she steamed north to Otaru, in Hokkaid≈ç, northernmost of the main Japanese home islands, for another initial landing on Nippon soil. At this point, the crew was asked if they wished to take part in the Bikini Atoll tests. There were not enough volunteers to man the ship, so she received orders to sail from Otaru into Tokyo Bay to take on Marines and Sailors returning home. She docked in Seattle, where she received many new crew members to replace those discharged, as well as a new captain. She returned to the Orient and was in Shanghai, China on the Huangpu River in February, 1946, but returned to the United States shortly afterwards. Berrien had 166 plank owners, and of the 321 enlisted men, 173 were with her from her commissioning, as were 20 of the 31 officers. =Decommission= She was decommissioned in May 1946, returned to the Maritime Commission on 12 August 1947, and placed in the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet. She participated in the Fleet Repair Program from 11 July 1955 to 28 October 1955 until returned to Suisun Bay. She was sold as scrap to Zidell Explorations, Inc. on 17 May 1966 and delivered 16 August 1966. = Decorations = Berrien received two battle stars for World War II service in the Pacific Theatre.

Kennedy. Powers served as Museum Curator of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum from 1964 until his retirement in May 1994. Powers was a military veteran who served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II from 1942 to 1945. Powers was also a close friend of Kennedy. Life and career The son of Irish immigrants, Powers was born and raised in the Charlestown section of Boston. His father died when he was two years old. Starting at the age of ten, Powers sold newspapers at the Charlestown Navy Yard to help support his mother and siblings. He graduated from Charlestown High School in 1930, and worked in a Boston publishing business until 1941. He would also take evening courses at Boston College, Harvard College, and the Boston Institute. During the Second World War, Powers served as a master sergeant in the Fourteenth Air Force in the China-Burma-India Theater.(https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/28/us/david- powers-85-aide-to-john-kennedy-dies.html?scp=1&sq;=David%20Powers&st;=cse) A Roman Catholic, he was chief usher at St. Catherine of Sienna Church in Charlestown. Powers first met Kennedy in 1946, when JFK was a Democratic candidate for the Massachusetts Eleventh Congressional District. Kennedy had heard that Powers had an understanding of the people and issues in the district that would be vital to helping him win the race. Although Powers was initially skeptical at how \\"a millionaire's son from Harvard\\" could appeal to the working-class voters in the district, he joined Kennedy's campaign after being impressed by a heartfelt speech Kennedy gave to Gold Star mothers who had lost sons in World War II. After Kennedy was elected to Congress, Powers \\"was at Kennedy's side at every step towards the White House.\\" Powers provided Kennedy with a kind of refuge from the burdens of the \\"political grind\\" of running for and serving in office. Powers had a \\"quick wit and easy regard for rogue politicians that endeared him to Kennedy...[he] enjoyed Powers's mischievous sense of humor.\\" President Kennedy at Power's 50th birthday party in the White House, 1962 When Kennedy was elected President of the United States in 1960, he appointed Powers as Special Assistant to the President. In this role Powers watched \\"over the President's needs, and was always with him on trips around the country and abroad. He usually was the first to see the President in the morning, and the last to see him at night. He was less a political adviser than simply a friend with whom Kennedy could relax. They would swim together in the White House pool, where Powers would use a breaststroke in order to keep up a steady chatter of amusing conversation that Kennedy enjoyed.\\" Historian Robert Dallek wrote that Powers was part of the \\"Irish Mafia\\" - a small group of White House aides who were \\"uncritically loyal to Kennedy and had made his rise possible\\", and that \\"Powers was the first among equals\\" in this group. Among his duties, Powers greeted distinguished visitors to the White House and escorted them to the Oval Office, and kept track of Kennedy's extensive wardrobe. Kennedy speechwriter and special counsel Theodore Sorensen recounted a story from the 1960 presidential campaign in which he did not have a necktie for a meeting, and \\"Dave Powers loaned me one from [Kennedy's] large traveling collection, assuring me that the senator never wore it.\\" Powers was an enthusiastic baseball fan, and his \\"amazing memory for sports and election statistics\\" impressed Kennedy. During the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Powers and Kenneth O'Donnell, another Kennedy aide, were riding in the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine. In 1996, the Assassination Records Review Board released three minutes of film footage captured by Powers in Dallas prior to the assassination. Powers said he began filming when the motorcade left Love Field but ran out of film at 12:17 p.m before reaching Dealey Plaza. Following President Kennedy's assassination, Powers was named the first curator of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. At the request of Robert F. Kennedy, Powers spent the years from 1965 to 1979 helping federal archivists gather and organize Kennedy memorabilia, papers, and other artifacts for the planned museum. When the Kennedy Library and Museum opened in Boston in 1979, Powers served as a curator at the museum until his retirement in 1994. Powers and Kenneth O'Donnell co-authored \\"Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye\\", a bestselling account of their mutual experiences working for Congressman, Senator, and President Kennedy. Reflecting on his time with Kennedy, Powers stated that JFK was \\"the greatest man I ever met, and the best friend I ever had.\\" Death On March 28, 1998 Powers died of cardiac arrest in Arlington, Massachusetts at the Symmes Medical Center. He was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Arlington.(https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/38991623/david-francis-powers) Family In 1952 Powers married Josephine (Jo) Lynch, a native of Wilmington, Massachusetts.(http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?pid=176240345) They had three children and three grandchildren.(http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?pid=176240345) Powers' granddaughter, Jenny Powers, gained fame as a Broadway actress and performer. An ardent Democrat like her grandfather, she was asked to sing the National Anthem at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Allegations of impropriety Judith Campbell Exner in her 1977 autobiography Judith Exner: My Story alleged that Powers assisted in setting up her sexual encounters with President Kennedy. Powers would later claim that Kennedy never had an affair with Exner, stating that the only Campbell he knew was \\"chunky vegetable soup.\\"(https://www.irishtimes.com/news/mistress-who-linked-jfk-to- mafia-don-1.233984)Judith Exner: From the Outfit to the Oval Office In her book, Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath, Mimi Alford claimed that while she was swimming with President Kennedy and David Powers one afternoon in the indoor White House pool, President Kennedy swam to her and whispered a request for her to give oral sex to Powers. Alford wrote that she complied with President Kennedy's request. According to Alford, Powers arranged her first two trysts with Kennedy. Historian Robert Dallek has written that Powers was a \\"facilitator\\" of Kennedy's affinity for extramarital relations, discreetly arranging the time and places for trysts with a variety of women. Journalist Seymour Hersh interviewed former Secret Service agent Larry Newman. Newman told Hersh that Powers \\"would find the women or bring the women along\\" for extramarital trysts with Kennedy on presidential trips, and alleged that Powers and Kenneth O'Donnell, another Kennedy aide, \\"could have been better friends, in my opinion...and also they could have had more respect for the security...they were really running a hard risk\\" in bringing women not checked by security into Kennedy's hotel rooms. In his 2008 memoir Counselor, Theodore Sorensen wrote that he \\"would not be shocked to learn that Dave Powers\\" had arranged extramarital trysts for President Kennedy.

Terminus post quem (\\"limit after which\\", often abbreviated to TPQ) and terminus ante quem (\\"limit before which\\", abbreviated to TAQ) specify the known limits of dating for events. A terminus post quem is the earliest time the event may have happened, and a terminus ante quem is the latest. An event may well have both a terminus post quem and a terminus ante quem, in which case the limits of the possible range of dates are known at both ends, but many events have just one or the other. Similarly, terminus ad quem (\\"limit to which\\") is the latest possible date of a non-punctual event (period, era, etc.), while terminus a quo (\\"limit from which\\") is the earliest. The concepts are similar to those of upper and lower bounds in mathematics. Example For example, consider an archaeological find of a burial that contains coins dating to 1588, 1595, and others less securely dated to 1590‚Äì1625. The terminus post quem for the burial would be the latest date established with certainty: in this case, 1595. A secure dating of an older coin to an earlier date would not shift the terminus post quem. An archaeological example of a terminus ante quem would be deposits formed before a historically dateable event, such as building foundations that were partly demolished to make way for the construction of a city wall. If it is known that the wall was finished in 650, then the foundations must have been demolished in 650 or earlier; all that can be said from the evidence is that it happened before the known event. Other examples of things that may establish a terminus are known dates of death or travel by persons involved, a particular form of heraldry that can be dated (see pastiglia for example), references to reigning monarchs or office-holders, or a placing relative to any other events whose date is securely known. In a modern context, dated images, such as those available in Google Earth, may establish termini. Related terms A terminus ante quem non differs from a terminus post quem by not implying the event necessarily took place. 'Event E happened after time T' implies E occurred, whereas 'event E did not happen before time T' leaves open the possibility that E never occurred at all.

Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (Oxford UP, 1971), p. 4. in Hampshire, England, is the terminus of the Watercress Line from Alton. It is in the small town of New Alresford, 7¬Ω miles (12 km) northeast of Winchester, close to the town's market square, tea rooms, many small shops and museum. In official literature it is shown as Alresford (Hampshire) in order to distinguish it from the station of the same name in Essex. History Opened in October 1865 for the new Alton, Alresford and Winchester Railway which later became the first incarnation of the Mid- Hants Railway, the station later joined the London and South Western Railway. It was absorbed as part of that into the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways upon nationalisation in 1948, and was then closed by the British Railways Board in February 1973. Preservation British Rail Class 205 approaching in 1970 The station reopened on 30 April 1977 as the western terminus of the Mid Hants Watercress Railway, a heritage railway. Alongside the station a goods shed was built which is now used as a shop, as well as meeting facilities and tourist facilities for the Mid Hants Watercress Railway. Adjacent to the station is a large warehouse which was built in 1873 for trading agricultural produce. This warehouse is now used for offices. The buffet building is the old station building from Lyme Regis in Dorset, which was dismantled and rebuilt here. Following the closure of the route between and , the line from Alresford eastwards to Alton has been reopened in preservation, but the section west of Alresford has not. It is unlikely that the line will ever be re-extended towards Winchester, because the M3 motorway and new houses have been built at various points along the former route. Both platforms have been extended to hold four-coach trains plus the 'Cattle Dock' is used particularly during steam locomotive gala exhibitions as platform 1A, holding a two-coach train when not otherwise used.

She was the first wife of Emperor Wu. Early life and marriage to Sima Yan Yang Yan was the daughter of Yang Wenzong (Ê•äÊñáÂÆó), a marquess during Cao Wei, and his wife Lady Zhao. Her mother died early, probably when she was still in infancy, and she was initially raised by her maternal uncle and aunt‚Äîwho breastfed her. After she grew older, she became raised by her stepmother Lady Duan; by this point, her father, who said to have died early as well, was probably dead. When she was young, she was described as intelligent, studious, and beautiful. A fortuneteller once foretold that she would have extraordinary honor, and it is said that when the Cao Wei regent Sima Zhao heard this, he took her and married her to his son Sima Yan. She bore for her husband three sons and three daughters. After Sima Zhao's death in 265, Sima Yan inherited his position and soon forced the Cao Wei emperor Cao Huan to abdicate in favor of him, ending Cao Wei and establishing Jin Dynasty (as Emperor Wu). In 266, he created her empress. As empress Empress Yang's oldest son, Sima Gui (Âè∏È¶¨Ëªå), died in childhood, making her second son, Sima Zhong the legitimate heir, by traditional succession laws. However, Emperor Wu hesitated about selecting him as crown prince because he was developmentally disabled. Empress Yang was instrumental in persuading him to have her son designated crown prince anyway, arguing that tradition should not be abandoned easily. She was also instrumental in her son's selection of a wife, as Emperor Wu initially favored Wei Guan's daughter, but Empress Yang, friendly with Jia Chong's wife Lady Yang, praised Jia's daughter Jia Nanfeng greatly, leading to Jia Nanfeng's selection as crown princess. In 273, when Emperor Wu was undergoing a major selection of beautiful women to serve as his concubines, he initially put Empress Yang in charge of the selection process. She preferred those with slender bodies and fair skin, but did not favor those who have beautiful faces. She also left off a beauty named Bian, whom Emperor Wu favored‚Äîstating that since the Bians have served as empresses for three generations during Cao Wei (Cao Cao's wife Princess Bian, Cao Mao's empress, and Cao Huan's empress) that it would be too degrading for her to be a concubine. These caused Emperor Wu to be displeased, and he took over the selection process himself. Despite this and her husband's obsession with accumulating concubines, however, they appeared to continue to have genuine affection for each other. In 274, Empress Yang grew ill. She became concerned that whoever would be empress next‚Äîand she was particularly concerned about Consort Hu Fen (ËÉ°Ëä¨), whom Emperor Wu greatly favored‚Äîwould not support her son. She therefore asked Emperor Wu to marry her cousin Yang Zhi. Emperor Wu, distressed over her illness, agreed. She died soon thereafter and was buried with honors due an empress, at the tomb that her husband was eventually buried at when he died in 290. Concubine Zuo Fen wrote a long song of mourning in her honour. In 276, based on his promise to her, the emperor married Yang Zhi and created her empress.

It is situated northwest of York at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Nidd. Cottages and houses are grouped around a village green of with a duck pond and a maypole. The Ouse is navigable for another and river traffic played an important part in the village's life until the middle of the twentieth century. Until 1974 Nun Monkton was in the West Riding of Yorkshire.  History  Some sort of settlement has probably existed since the earliest times. The name \\"Monkton\\" appears to reflect a pre-Viking or Anglian settlement in the 8th and 9th centuries. The village is mentioned in the late 11th-century Domesday Book where it is referred to ‚Äì like most villages in northern Yorkshire ‚Äì as vastatus i.e. deliberately wrecked by the invading Normans to prevent uprisings against them. = Medieval Benedictine nunnery = A hermitage or small monastic settlement may have existed at Nun Monkton during the Anglian period in Northumbria, prior to the arrival of the Vikings, giving rise to the 'Monkton' part of the village's name. The arrival of the nuns came about a century after the Norman Conquest. In 1172 an Anglo-Norman landowner, Ivetta of the Arches, endowed a small Benedictine nunnery which owned the village and stood on the important ford route from York and Moor Monkton to the south and Beningbrough and Shipton to the north, coming across the river. These routes ended when the ferry was discontinued in the middle of the 20th century. The Priory existed until 1536 when it was dissolved by Henry VIII, despite a plea from his second wife, Anne Boleyn, that it be spared. Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent. 18th century cottage in Priory grounds = Post-Reformation village and estate = Though Nun Monkton village remained a single estate until the 1930s, it changed hands several times after the Protestant Reformation. Its first owner was John Neville, the 3rd Baron Latimer and the second husband of Katherine Parr the last wife of Henry VIII. Latimer, who had been granted in 1538, bequeathed it and lands in Hammerton to his daughter at his death in 1543. During the later 17th century and the first half of the 18th century, it was owned by the Payler (or Paylor) family. On 2 July 1644 the Battle of Marston Moor, one of the largest battles ever fought on English soil, took place in fields some miles to the south-west of the village. Royalist troops under Prince Rupert crossed the Ouse between Beningbrough and Nun Monkton and proceeded on to Skipbridge where they crossed the Nidd and joined battle with the Parliamentarian army. Because of its proximity to the battlefield, Nun Monkton must have been directly affected but there seem to be no traditions, though older villagers in the late twentieth century reported claims that fallen soldiers were buried around St. Mary's Church. In 1748 the estate and those in surrounding villages passed to William Tufnell Jolliffe upon the death of his uncle Nathaniel Payler. A painting dated to 1773 shows Squire William Tufnell with his son on horseback amid a pack of hounds, looking across from the Moor Monkton bank of the Nidd at Nun Monkton Priory and Church. Despite the passage of 237 years, the view is relatively unchanged today. An elaborate early nineteenth century monument to the Tufnell family is today in the sacristy on the north side of the church. Before 1871 it was in the old sanctuary of the church and seems to have been somewhat damaged during while being moved. George IV while Prince of Wales, is believed to have had lunch at the Priory during a visit to Yorkshire.Harry Speight : Nidderdale and the garden of the Nidd: a Yorkshire Rhineland, 1894, p.116. In the 1840s one visitor to the village would have been the novelist Anne Bront√´, and her brother Branwell. During her time as a governess to the Robinson family at Thorpe Green, Little Ouseburn, Bront√´ taught the children of the rector of Nun Monkton.Robert Barnard, Louise Barnard A Bront√´ encyclopedia, 2007, p 131Edward Chitham, A life of Anne Bront√´, 1993 P. 116Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, Volumes 75‚Äì77. In 1860, Isaac Crawhall, a Durham-born gentleman, bought Nun Monkton from the Tufnell family and his family owned the estate and lived at the Priory until it was bought by the Whitworth family in the 1920s. Crawhall was responsible for the redesigning of the church and the building of the new roof and chancel between 1871 and 1875. A painting of villagers standing outside St.Mary's church by the landscape artist John Henry Leonard was sold at Christies in January 2009. It appears to date from the 1860s and may have been commissioned by Isaac Crawhall. Nun Monkton was visited in the summer of 1898 by the future Provost of Eton and ghost story writer, M.R.James on a boat trip from York during a meeting of Convocation. James was enchanted by the Priory house and gardens and its chinoiserie summer house near the river. He wrote in a letter: \\"At Nun Monkton a beautiful house adjoins the church ‚Äî Queen Anne with a sweet garden and leaden statues and a summerhouse.\\" Nun Monkton later appears to have provided some of the background for his gruesome ghost story \\"The Ash Tree\\", though in the story the house is situated in Suffolk. The largest secular building in Nun Monkton and architecturally by far the finest after the church, is the hall or manor house formally known as the Priory, and used as a location in the television series A Touch of Frost in an episode entitled \\"Endangered Species\\". Observant viewers who know the location will note that when Jack Frost (played by David Jason) drives up to The Priory it shows the gate to the left of the cattle grid, over which a temporary wall was erected for the TV programme. In the grounds of the Priory is Avenue Cottage, an 18th-century grade II listed building. = Church = St Mary's church The village church of St Mary's is the Church of England parish church. It is the sole surviving structure from the former priory and of considerable interest for students of Anglo-Norman architecture. At the Reformation the east end of the church was demolished and, until the 1870s, St Mary's Nun Monkton was a truncated low-roofed building with standard 18th-century Anglican fittings such as box pews and monuments. In the 1870s, however, as a result of the impact of the Tractarian movement, the village squire of the day, Isaac Crawhall, commissioned a new east end, built in high Anglican style. There is a conspicuous red sanctuary lamp, though the altar does not feature a tabernacle. Most impressive is the magnificent east window with glass by Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris which has a claim to be the best stained glass in North or West Yorkshire. = Village custom = Until the first half of the 19th century, Nun Monkton villagers annually performed a ceremony of digging up, parading, and reburying a statue supposed to represent St Peter, the village's patron saint. The custom is said to have been stopped by a vicar who regarded it as a pagan survival. The fullest modern account of it seems to be given in the adjudication ruling by A.A.Baden Fuller which ruled that the village common was a green in 1974. Fuller writes as follows:,A.A. Baden Fuller; Decision : In the Matter of the Common or The Green and Moor End, Nun Monkton, Nidderdale Rural District Council Yorkshire West Riding Reference No 45/D/23-28 11 February 1974, p.21. \\"St. Peter's Day, 29 June, is the Feast Day in Nun Monkton and a correspondent writing in the Daily Herald in 1868 stated that it was customary in former years to observe a Festival known as \\"Rising Peter\\", but that it was almost obsolete in 1868. According to the writer ‚Äì \\"The Festivities extended over a week, and the same procedure was observed year after year.\\" On the Saturday evening preceding the 29th a company of parishioners headed by fiddlers and players of other instruments went in procession across the Great Common to Maypole Hill where there was an old sycamore tree, for the purpose of \\"Rising Peter\\", who had been buried under the tree after the last St. Peter's Day. This effigy of St. Peter, rudely carved in wood and clothed in a fantastic fashion was placed in a box and conveyed to the neighbouring house (possibly the Inn) where it was exposed to view and kept there until the following Saturday, when another procession formed and St. Peter was reinterred. This was called \\"burying Peter\\". On the evening of the first day of the feast, young men went through the village with large baskets for the purpose of collecting tarts and cheese cakes and eggs for mulled ale, all being consumed at the above ceremonies. Afterwards ‚Äì dancing, sports, and suppers took place in the village every day while the feast lasted.  Widdington  The small community of Widdington lies in the north of the parish. Widdington was historically a township in the ancient parish of Little Ouseburn. It became a separate civil parish in 1866.Vision of Britain website: Widdington CP In 1988 the parish was absorbed into the civil parish of Nun Monkton.Harrogate (Parishes) Order 1988,  Nun Monkton today  Alice Hawthorn pub, 2005Nun Monkton ceased to be an estate village in 1934 when the estate houses of the village were sold off. The population today, of around 250, is well below its high point of about 350 in the 1890s and consists largely of commuters travelling daily to York, Harrogate and Leeds and retired people. The last shop in the village closed in 1986. The village green, however, continues to be grazed by cows and other animals and is one of the last working greens in Yorkshire. The Alice Hawthorn public house was named after the 1840s equine winner of the Doncaster Cup and Queen's Vase and was formerly The Blue Bell Inn. The Alice closed in 2007 after 220 years, but reopened after refurbishment under new management in September 2009. It has since closed and reopened under new management in summer 2013. The Yorkshire Heart Vineyard and Brewery was founded in Nun Monkton in 2000 and won a gold medal in the International Wine Challenge Cellar Door of the Year awards.  Nun Monkton Foundation Primary School  There has been a school in Nun Monkton at least since the early-18th century when the Dorothy Wilson Trust was set up in York to endow education for both boys and girls in the village. The current school building dates from 1905 and was built on the playground of the earlier school. While other villages were losing their primary schools the Nun Monkton community fought hard in the 1990s to preserve its school. The school currently has Foundation status.  Maypole  Nun Monkton has had a maypole at least since the 1790s. A Norwegian pine maypole was erected in 1871 by the village squire of the time, Isaac Crawhall. Constant work is needed to preserve a maypole and in the 1920s the pole had to be shortened and re- erected. A similar operation was carried out by the British Army in 1975. But in March 2004, Isaac Crawhall's green-and-white-striped maypole finally snapped and fell down in a gale. The village has now replaced the maypole with an pole, reportedly the tallest in England, though unlike its predecessor it is a two-piece construction.

For many years, the ground's official name was Aris Stadium, until it was renamed in honor of Kleanthis Vikelidis, a legendary player of Aris FC in the 1930s. However, most commonly referred to as \\"Charilaou Stadium\\", after the district in which it was built. The stadium's capacity was 23,200 although it got limited to 22,800 after the renovations for the 2004 Summer Olympics, where it served as a training ground for Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Its facilities include dressing rooms, a gym, a swimming pool, VIP boxes, a VIP lounge, a restaurant with pitch view and press rooms. The capacity of the stadium is 22,800.  History  The football stadium opened in 1951. The expansion of the stadium took place in stages. In 1969 it was moved for the first time to a grass surface. In 1972, the grandstand was roofed in the West. The North Stand, which is the home crowd reserved, was completed 1975. During the Olympic football tournaments of the 2004 Summer Olympics, modernization measures were adopted.  Architecture  The Charilaou is a pure football stadium without running track for athletics competitions. The most obvious change after the renovation of 2004 was the establishment of a new grandstand. This is in contrast to the old holding a top rank, is what defined by a tier of boxes from the lower part. The stadium got new seats, which are the club colors of yellow and black. In addition, the grids were in front of the side stands, which separated the stands from the field, removed and, at the point where the local fans are housed by plexiglas. The stadium sometimes is called by the Aris fans as \\"La Bombonera\\", inspired by the emblematic home ground of Boca Juniors, a friendly club of Aris, who play often friendly matches with. It is related also with the atmosphere created by Aris fans.  Other uses  Below the grandstand, is located -next to the dressing rooms- a sports hall and a sports pool, which serves the swimming department of Aris Thessaloniki as a training facility.

In late 1943, it assumed a split operation as its 500th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (FBS) moved to Harris Neck Army Air Field, Georgia and its 502d FBS moved to Punta Gorda Army Air Field, Florida, while the group and remaining squadrons remained at Waycross Army Air Field. It received a few P-47 Thunderbolts in March 1944. It served as a RTU until it disbanded in early in 1944, when like most RTUs and Operational Training Units its personnel, equipment, and training activities at Waycross were handed over to the 345th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter).Maurer, Combat Units, p. 7 Those at Punta Gorda became the duty of the 344th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter)See Abstract, History Punta Gorda AAF May 1944 (accessed Nov 6, 2012) and at Harris Neck of the 346th AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter).Abstract, History Harris Neck AAF Jun 1944 (accessed Nov 6, 2012) This reorganization occurred because the AAF found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Craven & Cate, p. 75 =Cold War= : See also: 57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron; Naval Air Station Keflavik USAF Iceland Emblem 57th Fighter Interceptor Squadron F-4C Phantom intercepting a Tu-95R \\"Bear B\\" bomber 57th Fighter Interceptor Squadron McDonnell F-4E Phantom The second predecessor of the 85th Group was the Iceland Air Defense Force, which replaced the Iceland Base Command, which had been the headquarters for Army (and later Air Force) units stationed in Iceland since 1942 and was assigned to Military Air Transport Service (MATS). Between 1952 and 1961, provided air defense for Iceland, operated Keflavik Airport, and furnished base support for all U.S. military forces in Iceland.AFHRA Factsheet, 85th Group (accessed Nov 6, 2012) Fighters assigned to the unit routinely intercepted Soviet Union aircraft flying in the Iceland area. It performed its defense mission under North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as the Air Force component of NATO Iceland Defense Force. Keflavik Airport was transferred to the U.S. Navy on 30 June 1961, along with base support activities. Air Forces Iceland continued the air defense mission of Iceland as a tenant organization at Keflavik. it was transferred from MATS to Air Defense Command in 1962; Tactical Air Command in 1978 and Air Combat Command in 1992 until it was inactivated in 1993 and replaced by the 35th Wing. In 1994, it was consolidated with the 85th Tactical Fighter Training Wing and activated to replace the 35th Wing to serve again as the headquarters for Air Force units in Iceland, as the 85th Wing. It assumed the operational management of fighter and tanker aircraft deployed to Iceland to protect the nation's airspace. It defended U.S. national interests in the North Atlantic. In 2003, its 56th Rescue Squadron deployed to Liberia as part of Joint Task Force Liberia. It provided a U.S. presence over the capital of Monrovia towards the end of the Second Liberian Civil War and saved lives by extracting people from the United States Embassy in Monrovia. Air Force reductions and a new agreement with the Government of Iceland continued to affect Keflavik organizations. On 1 March 1995, the 57th Fighter Squadron was inactivated and the interceptor force was replaced by Regular Air Force and Air National Guard F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft rotating every 90 days to Iceland. The 85th Wing was reduced to a Group level in 1995 and supported rotational deployments. In 2002 jurisdiction of Air Force units in Iceland was transferred to the United States Air Forces in Europe. The 85th Group continued to support rotational deployments until it was inactivated during a one-hour, formal ceremony on 28 June 2006, as a result of the Air Force reduction in forces in Iceland. All rotational fighters left and the 56th Rescue Squadron ceased operation at the end of the fiscal year.

Career: United States  Mantler was born in Vienna, Austria. In the early 1960s, he was a student at the Academy of Music and Vienna University, concentrating on trumpet and musicology. He continued his studies at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. In 1964, he moved to New York City and joined the Jazz Composers Guild with Roswell Rudd, Archie Shepp, and Cecil Taylor. He founded the Jazz Realities quintet with Carla Bley and toured in Europe with Steve Lacy. After the Guild broke up, he established the Jazz Composer's Orchestra Association (JCOA). Its purpose was to provide an outlet for new orchestral jazz compositions. For its first record release he produced a double album of his music during 1968, entitled The Jazz Composer's Orchestra, with soloists Cecil Taylor, Don Cherry, Roswell Rudd, Pharoah Sanders, Larry Coryell, and Gato Barbieri. Some of this music was also performed during the \\"Long Concerts\\" at the Electric Circus in New York in 1969. The problems of independently distributing the orchestra's record label led him to form the New Music Distribution Service (as a division of JCOA) in 1972, an organization which was to serve many independent labels for almost twenty years. Mantler and Bley started their own company, WATT, which was a record label, recording studio, and music publisher. By the mid 1970s both orchestra and distributor discontinued their activities. Mantler recorded many solo albums with varying instrumentation and personnel, emphasizing his work as a composer rather than as a band leader. Appearing live infrequently, he concentrated on composing and recording. He recorded Something There with the string section of the London Symphony Orchestra and several albums using the words of writers Samuel Beckett (No Answer), Harold Pinter (Silence), and Edward Gorey (The Hapless Child). Reviewing Mantler's 1978 Movies LP in Christgau's Record Guide, Robert Christgau wrote, \\"Great title for the ultimate soundtrack demo, utilizing the chops and sound of Larry Coryell, Tony Williams, Steve Swallow, and Carla Bley on bracing (if rather detached) compositions that unite the conventions of jazz group writing with those of twentieth-century European music. Sticks to the ribs.\\" Commissions and performances with European orchestras followed, at the Danish Radio, the Swedish Radio, the North and West German Radio, and the Lille Opera. His 1987 album Many Have No Speech contained songs in English, German, and French that were based on the poetry of Samuel Beckett, Ernst Meister, and Philippe Soupault, with vocals by rock musicians Jack Bruce, Marianne Faithfull, and Robert Wyatt. From 1977 until 1985 he was also a member of the Carla Bley Band, touring extensively throughout Europe, the US, and Japan, as well as appearing on all of the Band's recordings. Mantler and Bley were married from 1965 ‚Äì1991 and had one daughter, Karen Mantler, who became a musician.  Career: Europe  In 1991 he left the United States and moved to Europe, dividing his time between Copenhagen, Denmark and the South of France. A new orchestral piece was commissioned by the Austrian Donau Festival, and was premi√®red near Vienna in June 1991 by the N√∂.Tonk√ºnstlerorchester, conducted by Michael Gibbs, with Andy Sheppard as soloist. New compositions were also commissioned by the Danish Radio Big Band and the North German Radio Big Band in Hamburg. During 1992 Mantler recorded a new album, titled Folly Seeing All This, released by ECM Records in March 1993, which features the Balanescu Quartet plus other instrumentalists. The album includes instrumental compositions and one song, music set to Samuel Beckett's last work written shortly before his death in 1989, the poem \\"What Is the Word\\" featuring the voice of Jack Bruce. In 1993 he formed the Chamber Music and Songs ensemble, featuring his trumpet plus Mona Larsen (voice), Bjarne Roup√© (guitar), Kim Kristensen (keyboards), and a string quartet consisting of Marianne S√∏rensen (violin), Mette Winther (viola), Gunnar Lychou (viola), and Helle S√∏rensen (cello). Its premiere took place at the Copenhagen Jazzhouse in September, followed by a studio production at Denmark Radio. Cerco un Paese Innocente, a \\"Suite of Songs and Interludes for Voice, Untypical Big Band, and Chamber Ensemble\\", with words by the Italian poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, had its premiere in concert at Denmark Radio in January 1994. Featured were the voice of Mona Larsen, Mantler's ensemble, and the Danish Radio Big Band, conducted by Ole Kock Hansen. The work was subsequently recorded in the studio and released by ECM Records in 1995. The School of Understanding (\\"sort-of-an-opera\\") had its premi√®re in August 1996 at Arken, the new Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen. Participants included singers Jack Bruce, Mona Larsen, Susi Hyldgaard, John Greaves, Don Preston, Karen Mantler, Per J√∏rgensen, and Robert Wyatt. The recording was released as a double-CD by ECM in November 1997, followed by a new live production at the Hebbel Theater in Berlin. His One Symphony, commissioned by the broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk, was premiered in November 1998 by the Radio Symphony Orchestra Frankfurt, conducted by Peter Rundel. The recording of the work was released in February 2000, together with previously recorded material featuring Mona Larsen and the Chamber Music and Songs ensemble interpreting songs set to texts by Ernst Meister. Hide and Seek, an album of songs with words by Paul Auster (from his play by the same name) for chamber orchestra and the voices of Robert Wyatt and Susi Hyldgaard, was released in March 2001. Theatrical productions of the work, conceived by Rolf Heim (who has previously worked with Mantler on the School of Understanding performances), were produced in the Spring of 2002 in Copenhagen (Kanonhallen, February) and Berlin (Hebbel Theater, March). His Concerto for Marimba and Vibraphone (commissioned by Portuguese percussionist Pedro Carneiro in 2001) premiered at the Hessischer Rundfunk in March 2005 with the Radio Symphony Orchestra Frankfurt conducted by Pascal Roph√©. During September 2006 Porgy & Bess in Vienna presented a series of retrospective portrait concerts with his Chamber Music and Songs ensemble In recognition of his life's work he received several Austrian awards: the State Prize for Improvised Music, the Prandtauer Prize of the City of St. P√∂lten, where he spent his early youth, and the Music Prize of the City of Vienna. The anthology Review (recordings 1968 ‚Äì 2000), released by ECM in 2006, traced his musical path during more than 30 years of recordings for JCOA, WATT, and ECM. He appeared at the JazzFest Berlin in November 2007 with his Concertos project, featuring the Kammerensemble Neue Musik Berlin under the direction of Roland Kluttig. A studio recording of the concertos with soloists Bjarne Roup√© (guitar), Bob Rockwell (tenor saxophone), Roswell Rudd (trombone), Pedro Carneiro (marimba and vibraphone), Majella Stockhausen (piano), Nick Mason (percussion), and Mantler on trumpet, was released by ECM during November 2008. His next CD (For Two), a series of duets for guitar (Bjarne Roup√©) and piano (Per Salo), was released by ECM during June 2011. New works were commissioned and performed by the Max Brand Ensemble, conducted by Christoph Cech (Chamber Music Eight, Tage der Neuen Musik, Krems, Austria, 2012) and by the Chaos Orchestra, conducted by Arnaud Petit (Oiseaux de Guerre, featuring singer Himiko Paganotti, Forum Blanc-Mesnil, France, 2014). During September 2013, Porgy & Bess in Vienna presented his Jazz Composer's Orchestra Update project, featuring the Nouvelle Cuisine Big Band, conducted by Christoph Cech, with soloists Michael Mantler (trumpet), Harry Sokal and Wolfgang Puschnig (saxophones), Bjarne Roup√© (guitar), David Helbock (piano) and the radio.string.quartet.vienna. The program included a complete re- working of all the pieces from the original 1968 The Jazz Composer's Orchestra album, as well as of older material from as early as 1963, never before performed or recorded. A selection of recordings from these performances was released by ECM Records during November 2014. The complete project was performed live several times during 2015/16: at the Moers Festival and at the North Sea Jazz Festival in Rotterdam (with the Nouvelle Cuisine Big Band) and at the German Jazzfestival Frankfurt (with the hr-Bigband), as well as in Portugal at the Lisbon Jazz em Agosto Festival (with the Orquestra Jazz de Matosinhos) Comment c'est (How It Is), a song cycle for voice (Himiko Paganotti) and chamber orchestra (the Max Brand Ensemble) was premiered with two concerts at Porgy & Bess in Vienna during September 2016. A studio recording of the work was released by ECM Records during November 2017.

History The Presbyterian Girls' College and The Scots College were established as boarding schools for girls and boys in 1918 and 1919 respectively, by Messrs. B. T. DeConlay, R. J. Shilliday, and W. R. Black, to serve the needs of the large Scottish population in the area and provide a solid Presbyterian education. The two separate schools were amalgamated in 1970, and this new co-educational school was named The Scots PGC College. Scots PGC became a school of the Uniting Church in 1977, following Church union. 1995 saw the College Council move to adopt a new school badge designed by Neil Bonnell (Principal from 1985 to 1994), and a new school motto, \\"Always Aiming Higher\\". Prior to this the badges and mottos of both the original schools were used. The mottos were \\"Semper Petens Alta\\" (\\"Always Aiming Higher\\") for the boys, and \\"E Labore Dulcedo\\" (\\"Sweetness Out of Labour\\") for the girls.The Scots PGC College- History (accessed:26-06-2007) Uniform The Clan Cameron of Erracht Tartan is the basis of the College uniform.

According to some records, his name was originally Kazama Kotar≈ç (È¢®Èñì Â∞èÂ§™ÈÉé). The F≈´ma clan and F≈´ma Kotar≈ç The clan was based in Kanagawa Prefecture, specializing in horseback guerrilla warfare and naval espionage.Stephen K. Hayes, Ninja: Legacy of the Night Warrior, p.16.Donn F. Draeger, Ninjutsu: The Art of Invisibility, p.129-130. According to some sources, the family has roots in the 10th century when they served Taira no Masakado in his revolt against the Kyoto government. The use of the name started with the first leader (jonin) of the clan: originally surnamed \\"È¢®Èñì\\" (F≈´ma), with a different kanji, it was later changed to homophone È¢®È≠î. Each subsequent leader of the school adopted the same name as its founder, making it difficult to identify them individually. This school was in the service of the H≈çj≈ç clan of Odawara. F≈´ma Kotar≈ç was the fifth and the best known of the F≈´ma clan leaders. Born in Sagami Province (modern Kanagawa Prefecture) on an unknown date, he became notorious as the leader of a band of 200 Rappa \\"battle disrupters\\",Stephen K. Hayes, The Mystic Arts of the Ninja: Hypnotism, Invisibility, and Weaponry, p.4. divided into four groups: brigands, pirates, burglars and thieves. Kotar≈ç served under H≈çj≈ç Ujimasa and H≈çj≈ç Ujinao. His biggest achievement came in 1580, when the F≈´ma ninja covertly infiltrated and attacked a camp of the Takeda clan forces under Takeda Katsuyori at night, succeeding in causing severe chaos in the camp, which resulted in mass fratricide among the disoriented enemies. In 1590, Toyotomi Hideyoshi laid siege to Odawara Castle, which eventually fell, and the H≈çj≈ç clan was forced to surrender. When the Tokugawa shogunate came to power, the remnants of F≈´ma- ry≈´ were reduced to a band of brigands operating in and around Edo. A popular but fictional story says that in 1596, Kotar≈ç was responsible for the death of Hattori Hanz≈ç, a famous ninja in the service of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who had tracked him down in the Inland Sea, but Kotar≈ç has succeeded in luring him into a small channel, where a tide trapped the Tokugawa gunboats and his men then set fire to the channel with oil. Kotar≈ç was eventually caught by the shogunate's special law-enforcement force, guided by his rival and a former Takeda ninja K≈çsaka Jinnai (È´òÂùÇÁîöÂÜÖ), and executed through beheading by an order of Ieyasu in 1603. In folklore and popular culture In a folk legend, he is often an inhuman figure: a supposedly part-oni monstrous giant (over 2 meters tall) with inverted eyes.Joel Levy, Ninja: The Shadow Warrior, p.165-166. In fiction portrayals, F≈´ma Kotar≈ç is often depicted as Hattori Hanz≈ç's arch- rival. As the name F≈´ma literally means \\"wind demon\\", F≈´ma Kotar≈ç's depiction is frequently more flamboyant, fantastical, and sometimes even demonic. In contrast, Hanz≈ç is usually rendered with a relatively subdued appearance. Kotar≈ç is a player character in the video game Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny as a young ninja in the service of the H≈çj≈ç clan, also returning in the spin- offs Onimusha Tactics and Onimusha Soul. He is also a main character in the World Heroes fighting game series (as \\"Fuuma\\"), also featured in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum together with his main rival Hanzo. In the video game Samurai Warriors 2 and its sequels along with its spin-off series Warriors Orochi, he is Hanz≈ç's foe, who, despite serving the H≈çj≈ç clan, prefers chaos and continually makes trouble for many factions. He also appears in several other video games such as Fate/Grand Order (as an assassin class servant), Getsu F≈´ma Den, Kessen III (as an optional bonus character), Nobunaga's Ambition II, Sengoku Basara 2 (initially as a non-player character, he became playable in the Heroes edition), Sengoku Basara 3 and Sengoku Basara 4, Persona 2: Eternal Punishment (as a summonable \\"persona\\" character), Pok√©mon Conquest (as a playable sidequest character), Shall We Date?: Ninja Love (as a romance option or the player character), and Taik≈ç Risshiden V (as an unlockable player character). He is further featured in the manga series Nabari no Ou, where he appears as the shape-shifting leader of the F≈´ma ninja village and an ally of the protagonist, and also makes an appearance in the light novel series Mirage of Blaze during the story arc involving the H≈çj≈ç clan, and in the manga and anime series Samurai Deeper Kyo, where he is Sarutobi Sasuke's childhood friend and rival, and Karasu Tengu Kabuto. F≈´ma Kotar≈ç is featured in the manga Hana no Keiji: Kumo no Kanata ni; in the SNES game of the same title, he is the final opponent that Keiji Maeda has to fight against. The anime series Sengoku Collection features a female interpretation of Kotar≈ç, being a servant to the female version of Imagawa Yoshimoto. In the manga and anime series Laughing Under the Clouds, Fuma Kotaro is a couple of twins who both rule over a falling Fuma clan. In the manga series Yaiba, he is a revenant brought back to life by Onimaru. His 18th-century descendant F≈´ma Kotar≈ç Kaneyoshi is the hero's nemesis through most of the TV series The Samurai. His modern descendant is a player character in the video game Ninja Commando. The F≈´ma clan are also featured in the TV series Shogun Iemitsu Shinobi Tabi and the video games and Inindo: Way of the Ninja. In the Soul series of video games they are represented by the female ninja Taki and several minor characters including Li Long's lover Chie (Souls and Tekkens Yoshimitsu has also used the Fumaken sword since Tekken 6). Characters who are modern-day descendants of the F≈´ma clan include title characters in the manga series F≈´ma no Kojir≈ç and the anime film The Plot of the Fuma Clan, as well as two of the main characters in the manga X. In the manga and anime series Naruto, the character Pain was revealed to have a body that originated from the F≈´ma clan when he kills his rival Hanz≈ç. A fictional weapon called the F≈´ma shuriken is a large collapsible shuriken with four blades. In 2014, Makai Syojyo Ken held a professional wrestling event where several wrestlers performed as historical figures; during the event, Isami Kodaka performed as F≈´ma Kotar≈ç.

Roland Garros was constructed to provide a venue for France's first successful Cup defense in 1928. France was an important power in tennis during the first half of the 20th century due to the dominance of Suzanne Lenglen during the 1910s and 1920s, and les Quatre Mousquetaires (\\"the Four Musketeers\\")‚ÄîJacques \\"Toto\\" Brugnon, Jean Borotra (the \\"Bouncing Basque\\"), Henri Cochet (the \\"Magician\\"), and Ren√© Lacoste (the \\"Crocodile\\")‚Äîin the 1920s and 1930s. In 1927, France defeated the United States to win the Davis Cup, due largely to the Musketeers' efforts. Roland Garros was constructed as a venue for France's successful defense the following year.A Visit to Roland Garros. Colleen's Paris Retrieved 2010-08-16. France retained the Cup until 1933, again largely because of the Musketeers. A monument to France's six Cup championships stands at the center of Place des Mousquetaires, a circular courtyard near the venue's entrance. In October 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, the facility was used as a detention centre where \\"ind√©sirables\\"‚Äîmostly Hungarians, Russians, Italians, Poles, and citizens suspected of being communists‚Äîwere held pending imprisonment. Journalist and former communist Arthur Koestler reported that at the time of his detention, posters advertising the last match prior to the outbreak of war, between Cochet and Borotra, were still in place. Playing surface While the Roland Garros surface is invariably characterized as \\"red clay\\", the courts are in fact surfaced with white limestone covered with a few millimeters of powdered red brick dust. Beneath the layer of porous limestone is of volcanic rock, followed by of sand, all of which rests on a slab of concrete. Crushed brick is pressed onto the limestone surface with rollers, then drenched in water. The process is repeated several times until a thin, compact layer coats each court. The crushed brick is deep enough to allow footprints and ball marks, but shallow enough to avoid making the court spongy or slippery. In tournament situations workers smooth the surface before matches and between sets by dragging rectangular lengths of chain-link across it. The red brick dust is replenished as needed (daily during major tournaments). The surface was a state-of-the art solution, in 1928, to the biggest problem with natural clay courts: poor drainage. At the time it was not unusual for clay surfaces to be unplayable for two to three days after even short periods of precipitation. The limestone/crushed brick combination, originally developed in Britain, played and looked similar to clay without clay's drainage issues, thus rendering natural clay obsolete as a tennis court surface. Since then a multitude of other \\"fast-dry\\" and synthetic clay surfaces have been developed. Courts surfaced with these materials play much like natural clay surfaces and are collectively classified as \\"clay courts\\", despite the fact that few if any true clay courts have been built for almost a century. The diversity in composition of various \\"clay\\" surfaces around the world explains the extraordinary variability in their playing characteristics. ‚ÄúAll clay courts are different,‚Äù Venus Williams has said. ‚ÄúNone play the same. [Roland Garros] plays the best.‚Äù Stadium courts =Court Philippe Chatrier= Court Philippe Chatrier prior to 2019 refurbishment Court Philippe Chatrier was built in 1928 as Roland Garros's centerpiece and remains its principal venue, seating 15,225 spectators (renovated and enlarged in 2019). The stadium was known simply as \\"Court Central\\" until 2001, when it was renamed for the long- time president of the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Tennis (FFT) who helped restore tennis as a Summer Olympics sport in 1988. The four main spectator grandstands are named for les Quatre Mousquetaires‚ÄîBrugnon, Borotra, Cochet, and Lacoste‚Äîin honor of their Davis Cup success, which prompted construction of the facility, and the stadium. As a further tribute, the trophy awarded each year to the French Open men's singles champion is known as La Coupe des Mousquetaires. After the completion of the 2018 tournament, the stadium was demolished down to its foundations and rebuilt with steeper grandstands in time for the 2019 tournament. A retractable roof and floodlights were added in time for the 2020 tournament (lighting was installed over all courts in the precinct to facilitate night matches), which was delayed to September of that year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. =Court Suzanne Lenglen= Court Suzanne Lenglen Built in 1994 and originally designated \\"Court A\\", Court Suzanne Lenglen is the secondary stadium with a capacity of 10,068 spectators.Event Guide / Map and Directions Roland Garros ‚Äì French Open Its namesake, an international celebrity and the first true star of women's tennis, won 31 major tournaments, including six French Open titles and six Wimbledon championships, between 1914 and 1926.

A bronze bas relief of Lenglen by the Italian sculptor Vito Tongiani stands over the east tunnel-entrance to the stadium.

Its architect, Jean Lovera, a former French junior champion, designed the 3,800-seat structure as a deliberate contrast to the adjacent, angular Court Philippe Chatrier.

Permanent exhibits include a display of the French Open perpetual trophies, including La Coupe des Mousquetaires and La Coupe Suzanne Lenglen; a narrative and photographic history of Roland Garros; displays documenting the evolution of tennis attire through the years; a comprehensive collection of tennis racquets dating back to the mid-19th century; and a large exhibition of tennis-related photographs and paintings. The media library houses a diverse collection of documents, posters, books, and magazines, as well as a database of tennis information, statistics, trivia, and match summaries of all French Open tournament matches since 1928. The bilingual (French/English) multimedia center contains over 4,000 hours of digitized video including documentaries, interviews with many of the sport's legendary players, and film archives dating from 1897 to the present.

Expansion project In 2009 the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Tennis (FFT) announced that it had commissioned the French architect Marc Mimram to design a significant expansion of Stade Roland Garros. On the current property, the proposal called for the addition of lights and a retractable roof over Court Philippe Chatrier.

In 2010, faced with opposition to the proposed expansion from factions within the Paris City Council, the FFT announced that it was considering an alternate plan to move the French Open to a new, 55-court venue outside of Paris city limits. The three sites under consideration were Marne-la-Vall√©e, the northern Paris suburb of Gonesse, and a vacant army base near Versailles. Amid charges of bluffing and brinkmanship, a spokesman explained that because Roland Garros was less than half the size of the other three Grand Slam venues and had no covered courts, the French Open was at risk of losing its Grand Slam status to Madrid‚Äîwhich has a long clay court tradition and larger facilities‚Äîor the Gulf countries. In February 2011, the FFT voted to keep the tournament at Roland Garros, citing the prohibitive expense ($630 million to $1 billion) of building a new venue from scratch versus a projected $370 million to carry out the proposed expansion. Further details of the plan were announced in May 2013, including a complete rebuild of the Chatrier court on its existing foundations in addition to the new roof and lights, and a larger Place des Mousquetaires in the area occupied by Court 1. The new stadium at Porte d'Auteuil would be built below ground level, with greenhouses surrounding it on all four sides. Project deadlines were pushed back from 2016 to 2018. Local residents, wildlife enthusiasts and municipal authorities continued to voice opposition to the plan, which would increase the Roland Garros grounds from 21 acres (8.5 hectares) to about 33.8 acres (13.5 hectares).Clarey C (28 May 2013): \\"Renovation Plans in Limbo, Roland Garros Faces Future\\".

FFT also noted that opponents of the eastward expansion \\"[did] not have good alternatives from the operational, legal and environmental point of view\\", and added that expansion into the Bois de Boulogne was impossible.

According to the Talmud it is open on Rosh Hashanah, as is its analog for the wicked, the Book of the Dead. For this reason extra mention is made for the Book of Life during Amidah recitations during the Days of Awe, the ten days between Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Yom Kippur, the day of atonement (the two High Holidays, particularly in the prayer Unetaneh Tokef). In the Hebrew Bible In the Hebrew Bible the Book of Life‚Äîthe book or muster-roll of God‚Äîrecords forever all people considered righteous before God. To be blotted out of this book signifies death.Shemot (Book of Exodus) 32:33 It is with reference to the Book of Life that the holy remnant is spoken of as being written unto lifeA. V., \\"among the living\\" in Jerusalem; compare also Ezekiel 9:4, where one of the six heavenly envoys \\"who had the scribe's inkhorn upon his loins\\" is told to mark the righteous for life, while the remainder of the inhabitants of Jerusalem are doomed. The Psalms also speaks of a book of the living: \\"Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.; compare . Even the tears of men are recorded in this Book of God. \\"Every one that shall be found written in the book . . . shall awake to everlasting life\\". et seq. This book is probably identical with the \\"Book of Remembrance\\" in which are recorded the deeds of those that fear the Lord.  In apocrypha The apocryphal Book of Jubileesxxx. 20-22. speaks of two heavenly tablets or books: a Book of Life for the righteous, and a Book of Death for those that walk in the paths of impurity and are written down on the heavenly tablets as adversaries (of God). Also, according to Jubilees 36:10, one who contrives evil against his neighbor will be blotted out of the Book of Remembrance of men, and will not be written in the Book of Life, but in the Book of Perdition. In Daniel 12:1 and Enoch 47:3 \\"the Ancient of Days\\" is described as seated upon his throne of glory with \\"the Book\\" or \\"the Books of Life\\" (\\"of the Living\\") opened before him. So are, according to Enoch 56:1, the righteous \\"written before the glory of the Great One,\\" and, according to Enoch 108:3, the transgressors \\"blotted out of the Book of Life and out of the books of the holy ones.\\" Reference is made also in The Shepherd of Hermas (Vision i. 3; Mandate viii.; Similitude ii.); in Revelation 3:5, 13:8, 17:8, 20:12‚Äì15, where \\"two Books\\" are spoken of as being \\"opened before the throne, the Book of Life, and the Book of Death, in which latter the unrighteous are recorded together with their evil deeds, in order to be cast into the lake of fire.\\" It is the Book of Life in which the apostles' names are \\"written in heaven\\" (Luke 10:20), or \\"the fellow-workers\\" of Paul (Phil 4:3), and \\"the assembly of the first-born\\" (Hebrews 12:23; compare I Clem. 45). Allusion is made also in Enoch 81:4, 89:61‚Äì77, 90:17‚Äì20, 98:6-15, 104:7; 2 Baruch 24:1; Ascension of Isaiah 9:20. In the New Testament The Book of Life is referred to seven times in the Book of Revelation (3:5, 13:8, 17:8, 20:12, 20:15, 21:27, 22:19) one of the books of the New Testament, attributed to John of Patmos. As described, only those whose names are written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, and have not been blotted out by the Lamb, are saved at the Last Judgment; all others are doomed. \\"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire\\" (Rev. 20:15, King James Version). \\"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works\\". (Rev. 20:12, King James Version) It is also mentioned in Paul's letter to the Philippians: :Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life. The eschatological or annual roll-call While the prevailing tendency among apocryphal writers of the Hasidean school was to give the Book of Life an eschatological meaning, the Jewish liturgy and the tradition relating to the New Year and Atonement days adhered to the ancient view, which took the Book of Life in its natural meaning, preferring, from a practical point of view, the worldliness of Judaism to the heavenliness of the Essenes. Instead of transferring, as is done in the Book of Enoch, the Testament of Abraham, and elsewhere, the great Judgment Day to the hereafter, the Pharisaic school taught that on the first day of each year (Rosh Hashanah), God sits in judgment over his creatures and has the Books of Life together with the books containing the records of the righteous and the wicked. The origin of the heavenly Book of Life must be sought in Babylonia, where legendsSee Creation Tab. iv. 121, and the Zu legend, ii. 7, quoted in Harper's \\"Babylonische Legenden,\\" in Beitr. z. Assyriologie by Delitzsch and Haupt, 1892, ii. 2, p. 412. speak of the Tablets of Destiny and of tablets containing the transgressions, sins, wrongdoings, curses and execrations of a person who should be \\"cast into the water\\"; that is, blotted out.Compare Micah vii. 19 and the art. Tashlik. The living are the righteous,Ps. lxix.29. who alone are admitted to citizenship in the theocracy, while the wicked are denied membership and blotted out of God's book (Ex. xxxii. 32 et seq.).Ezek. xiii. 9; Jer. xxii. 30; and Ex. xxxii. 30-34, accordingly assigned by Holzinger to a late stratum; see his commentary. The life in which the righteous participate is to be understood in a temporal sense, as temporal life is apparently prayed for in the liturgical formula: \\"Inscribe us in the Book of Life.\\" In Daniel xii. 1, however, those who are found written in the book and who escape the troubles preparatory to the coming of the Messianic kingdom are they who, together with the risen martyrs, are destined to share in everlasting life. Eternal life is certainly meant in Enoch xlvii. 3, civ. 1, cviii. 3, and frequently in the New Testament, especially in Revelation. The Targum (Isa. iv. 3; Ezek. xiii. 9) speaks of the \\"Book of Eternal Life.\\" The Mishnah states that the deeds of every human being are recorded in a book (Abot, ii. 1; see iii. 16). The Sefer ·∏§asidim (xxxiii) pointedly adds that God is in no need of a book of records; \\"the Torah speaks the language of man.\\"  Fundraising  A book of life motif is frequently found in Jewish houses of worship. It is both a decorative feature and fundraiser. Some synagogues have raised money by inscribing congregation member's names in a \\"book of life\\" as a tribute to their financial generosity.

Application SAPS II was designed to measure the severity of disease for patients admitted to Intensive care units aged 15 or more. 24 hours after admission to the ICU, the measurement has been completed and resulted in an integer point score between 0 and 163 and a predicted mortality between 0% and 100%. No new score can be calculated during the stay. If a patient is discharged from the ICU and readmitted, a new SAPS II score can be calculated. This scoring system is mostly used to: * describe the morbidity of a patient when comparing the outcome with other patients. * describe the morbidity of a group of patients when comparing the outcome with another group of patients Calculation The point score is calculated from 12 routine physiological measurements during the first 24 hours, information about previous health status and some information obtained at admission. The parameters are: * Age * Heart Rate * Systolic Blood Pressure * Temperature * Glasgow Coma Scale * Mechanical Ventilation or CPAP * PaO2 * FiO2 * Urine Output * Blood Urea Nitrogen * Sodium * Potassium * Bicarbonate * Bilirubin * White Blood Cell * Chronic diseases * Type of admission The calculation method is optimized for paper schemas. In contrast to APACHE II, the resulting value is much better at comparing patients with different diseases . The calculation method results in a predicted mortality, that is pure statistics. It does not tell the individual patient's chance of survival. The main purpose of this calculation is to provide a value that can be averaged for a group of patients, since it gives very unprecise values to calculate an average of the scores of a group of patients .

She was a major figure in Lagos during the reigns of Obas Adele, Oluwole, Akitoye, and Dosunmu. Life and career =Early life= Tinubu was born in the Ojokodo forest area of Egbaland. Her father's name was Olumosa. She was allegedly of Owu ancestry, either through her maternal or paternal side. Madam Tinubu was reportedly married multiple times. Her first marriage was to an Owu man. It bore two sons. After her Owu husband died, she remarried the exiled Oba Adele Ajosun in 1833 who, while visiting Abeokuta, was charmed by Tinubu. She moved with the exiled Oba to Badagry, which was traditionally the place of refuge for Lagos monarchs. At Badagry, she exploited Adele's connections to build a formidable business trading in tobacco, salt, and slaves. =Lagos= The exiled Oba Adele was still in Badagry when his successor, Oba Idewu, died. Prince Kosoko, Idewu Ojulari's brother, was a major contender for the now vacant throne. Eletu Odibo, the chief kingmaker, thwarted Kosoko's aspiration and Adele was invited by him to become Oba again. Tinubu accompanied Adele to Lagos, but the Oba died 2 years later. After Adele's death in 1837, Tinubu reportedly supported Oluwole (her stepson) in his bid for the Obaship of Lagos over that of Kosoko's. Oba Oluwole had recurring conflicts with Kosoko, who felt that he was the true heir to the throne. Consequently, Kosoko was banished to Ouidah. During Oluwole's reign, Madam Tinubu remarried one Yesufu Bada, alias Obadina, who was Oluwole's war captain and with the support of Oluwole, Tinubu and Yesufu's trading activities in Egbaland grew . When Oluwole died in 1841, Tinubu supported Akitoye (her brother in law) in his bid for the Obaship over Kosoko's. After Akitoye emerged Oba, he granted Tinubu favorable commercial concessions. Against the wish of his chiefs, Akitoye invited Kosoko back to Lagos and tried to placate him. Soon thereafter, Kosoko dislodged Akitoye from the throne. Considering Tinubu's alliance with Akitoye, she and other Akitoye supporters fled to Badagry when Kosoko became Oba in 1845. As a wealthy woman, Madam Tinubu was able to influence economic and political decisions during her time in Badagry. She tried to rally Akitoye's supporters to wage war against Kosoko. In December 1851 and under the pretext of abolishing slavery, the British bombarded Lagos, dislodged Kosoko from the throne, and installed a more amenable Akitoye as Oba of Lagos. Though Akitoye signed a treaty with Britain outlawing the slave trade, Tinubu subverted the 1852 treaty and secretly traded slaves for guns with Brazilians and Portuguese traders. Further, she obtained a tract of land from Akitoye which now constitutes part of the present-day Tinubu Square and Kakawa Street. Later, a conflict developed between Tinubu and some slave traders including Possu, a Kosoko loyalist. Consequently, Possu, Ajenia, and other traders tried to instigate an uprising against Akitoye because of Madam Tinubu's influence in Lagos. In the interest of peace, Benjamin Campbell, the British Consul in Lagos, asked Akitoye to exile Tinubu . After Akitoye died, Tinubu returned to Lagos and gave her support to his successor, Dosunmu. Under Dosunmu's reign Tinubu had a massive security force composed of slaves and she sometimes executed orders usually given by the king. As a result, Dosunmu grew wary of her influence in Lagos. A new development was the colonial government's support for the return of repatriated captives (mostly of Yoruba heritage) to settle in Lagos. Many of the returnees, also called Saro, were favored by the British in commerce and soon began dominating legitimate trade in Lagos. In 1855, when Campbell traveled to England, Tinubu tried to influence Dosunmu to limit the influence of the returnees. Dosunmu was noncommittal to her request and consequently, Tinubu was alleged to have played a part in an uprising against the returnees in which her husband, Yesufu Bada, was a major participant. When Campbell returned in 1856, he asked Dosunmu to banish Tinubu. In May 1856, Tinubu was banished to Abeokuta.> =Abeokuta= In Abeokuta, Madam Tinubu traded in arms and supplied Abeokuta with munitions in the war against Dahomey. Her activities in the war earned her the chieftaincy title of the Iyalode of all of Egbaland. While in Abeokuta, she allegedly opposed colonial policies in Lagos. In 1865, a fire engulfed the shops of some traders including some of her properties in Abeokuta. This doesn't appear to have weakened her financially, however. Tinubu became involved in Abeokuta king-making activities as well, supporting Prince Oyekan over Ademola for the Alake of Egbaland's title in 1879. Personal life Tinubu appears to have had another marriage with one Momoh Bukar, an Arabic scholar. Momoh's children from other wives later adopted the Tinubu name. Death and legacy Tinubu died in 1887. Tinubu Square on Lagos Island, a place previously known as Independence Square, is named after her. Ita Tinubu (Tinubu's precinct or Tinubu Square) had long been known by that name before the country's independence, but it was renamed Independence Square by the leaders of the First Republic. She was buried at Ojokodo Quarters in Abeokuta. =Opinions on the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade = Some publications have asserted without any substantiation that Madam Tinubu became a changed person after learning about the evils of the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade. However, an often cited hagiography about Madam Tinubu by Oladipo Yemitan paints a different picture of an unapologetic and profit minded stance. Another section of Yemitan's Tinubu biography, referred to as the Amadie-Ojo Affair, captures a slave trading deal gone sour in 1853 (notably after the 1852 Treaty abolishing slavery in Lagos) wherein Madam Tinubu tells another slave trader (Domingo Martinez) that \\"she would rather drown the slaves [20 in number] than sell them at a discount\\".

These intrusions can be many kilometres in area covering from around to over and several hundred metres to over in thickness.Blatt, Harvey and Tracy, Robert J. (1996) Petrology: Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic, 2nd ed., pp. 123‚Äì132 & 194‚Äì197, Freeman, While most layered intrusions are Archean to Proterozoic in age (for example, the Paleoproterozoic Bushveld complex), they may be any age such as the Cenozoic Skaergaard intrusion of east Greenland or the Rum layered intrusion in Scotland. Although most are ultramafic to mafic in composition, the Ilimaussaq intrusive complex of Greenland is an alkalic intrusion. Layered intrusions are typically found in ancient cratons and are rare but worldwide in distribution. The intrusive complexes exhibit evidence of fractional crystallization and crystal segregation by settling or floating of minerals from a melt. Ideally, the stratigraphic sequence of an ultramafic-mafic intrusive complex consists of ultramafic peridotites and pyroxenites with associated chromitite layers toward the base with more mafic norites, gabbros and anorthosites in the upper layers. Some include diorite, and granophyre near the top of the bodies. Orebodies of platinum group elements, chromite, magnetite, and ilmenite are often associated with these rare intrusions. Intrusive behaviour and setting Mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions occur at all levels within the crust, from depths in excess of to depths of as little as . The depth at which an intrusion is formed is dependent on several factors: * Density of the melt. Magmas with high magnesium and iron contents are denser and are therefore less likely to be able to reach the surface. * Interfaces within the crust. Typically, a horizontal detachment zone, a dense, impermeable layer or even a lithological interface may provide a horizontal plane of weakness which the ascending magma will exploit, forming a sill or lopolith. * Temperature and viscosity. As an ascending magma rises and cools, it becomes thicker and more viscous. This then restricts the magma from rising further because more energy is required to push it upwards. Conversely, thicker magma is also more efficient at forcing apart the wall rocks, creating volume which the magma may fill. Intrusive mechanisms It is difficult to precisely determine what causes large ultramafic ‚Äì mafic intrusives to be emplaced within the crust, but there are two main hypotheses: plume magmatism and rift upwelling. =Plume magmatism= The plume magmatism theory is based on observations that most large igneous provinces include both hypabyssal and surficial manifestations of voluminous mafic magmatism within the same temporal period. For instance, in most Archaean cratons, greenstone belts correlate with voluminous dike injections as well as usually some form of larger intrusive episodes into the crust. This is particularly true of a series of ultramafic-mafic layered intrusions in the Yilgarn Craton of ~2.8 Ga and associated komatiite volcanism and widespread tholeiitic volcanism. Plume magmatism is an effective mechanism for explaining the large volumes of magmatism required to inflate an intrusion to several kilometres thickness (up to and greater than ). Plumes also tend to create warping of the crust, weaken it thermally so that it is easier to intrude magma and create space to host the intrusions. Geochemical evidence supports the hypothesis that some intrusions result from plume magmatism. In particular, the Noril'sk-Talnakh intrusions are considered to be created by plume magmatism, and other large intrusions have been suggested as created by mantle plumes. However, the story is not so simple, because most ultramafic-mafic layered intrusions also correlate with craton margins, perhaps because they are exhumed more efficiently in cratonic margins because of faulting and subsequent orogeny. =Rift magmatism= Some large layered complexes are not related to mantle plumes, or example, the Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland. Here, the large magma volumes which are created by mid-ocean ridge spreading allow the accumulation of large volumes of cumulate rocks. The problem of creating space for such intrusions is easily explained by the extensional tectonics in operation; extensional or listric faults operating at depth can provide a triangular space for keel-shaped or boat-shaped intrusions such as the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe, or the Narndee-Windimurra Complex of Western Australia. It is also possible that what we see as a cratonic margin today were created by the action of a plume event initiating a continental rifting episode; therefore the tectonic setting of most large layered complexes must be carefully weighed in terms of geochemistry and the nature of the host sequence, and in some cases a mixed mechanism cause is possible. Causes of layering The causes of layering in large ultramafic intrusions include convection, thermal diffusion, settling of phenocrysts, assimilation of wall rocks and fractional crystallization. The primary mechanism for forming cumulate layers is, of course, the accumulation of layers of mineral crystals on the floor or roof of the intrusion. Rarely, plagioclase is found in cumulate layers at the top of intrusions, having floated to the top of a much denser magma. Here it can form anorthosite layers. Accumulation occurs as crystals are formed by fractional crystallisation and, if they are dense enough, precipitate out from the magma. In large, hot magma chambers having vigorous convection and settling, pseudo-sedimentary structures such as flow banding, graded bedding, scour channels, and foreset beds, can be created. The Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland is a prime example of these quasi- sedimentary structures. Whilst the dominant process of layering is fractional crystallisation, layering can also result in a magma body through assimilation of the wall rocks. This will tend to increase the silica content of the melt, which will eventually prompt a mineral to reach the liquidus for that magma composition. Assimilation of wall rocks takes considerable thermal energy, so this process goes hand in hand with the natural cooling of the magma body. Often, assimilation can only be proven by detailed geochemistry. Often, cumulate layers are polyminerallic, forming gabbro, norite and other rock types. The terminology of cumulate rocks, however, is usually used to describe the individual layers as, for instance, pyroxene-plagioclase cumulates. Monomineralic cumulate layers are common. These may be economically important, for instance magnetite and ilmenite layers are known to form titanium, vanadium deposits such as at Windimurra intrusion and hard-rock iron deposits (such as at Savage River, Tasmania). Chromite layers are associated with platinum-palladium group element (PGE) deposits, the most famous of these being the Merensky Reef in the Bushveld Igneous Complex. The central section or upper sections of many large ultramafic intrusions are poorly layered, massive gabbro. This is because as the magma differentiates it reaches a composition favouring crystallisation of only two or three minerals; the magma may also have cooled by this stage sufficiently for the increasing viscosity of the magma to halt effective convection, or convection may stop or break up into inefficient small cells because the revervoir becomes too thin and flat. Crystals accumulation and layering can expel interstitial melt that migrates through the cumulate pile, reacting with it.Irvine TN (1980) \\"Magmatic infiltration metasomatism, double-diffusive fractional crystallization, and adcumulus growth in the Muskox intrusion and other layered intrusions\\", pp. 325‚Äì383 in Hagraves RB (ed) Physics of Magmatic Processes.

It is the first book in his Dray Prescot series of sword and planet novels, set on the fictional world of Kregen, a planet of the Antares star system in the constellation of Scorpio. It was first published by DAW Books in 1972. Bulmer's choice of the setting for the book, and for the series as a whole, is a subtle tribute to the Martian series of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the prototypical Sword and Planet romance. The star Antares, similar in brightness and hue to the planet Mars in the night sky, was given its name (meaning \\"like Mars\\") by early astronomers to compare it to and help distinguish it from the planet. Bulmer is signalling that his series is similar to that of his model.James Kaler, \\"Antares\\". Accessed 5/19/07. The Dray Prescot series is made of several cycles of novels, each cycle essentially forming a series within the series. In addition to being the first volume in the series as a whole, Transit to Scorpio is the initial volume in the Delian Cycle, which introduces the reader to a number of different Kregen locales as Prescot struggles to find his place in this strange new world and to win the hand of Delia, the love of his life. Plot summary The novel features the story of Dray Prescot, an English sailor of Lord Nelson's navy, and his miraculous teleportation to the planet Kregen. There he is trained as an agent for the mysterious Savanti, an apparently benevolent secret society devoted to improving the lot of humanity among the many intelligent species of Kregen. Among the benefits conferred on him is immersion in an apparently miraculous pool, Kregen's equivalent of the Fountain of Youth, which heals all wounds and confers a greatly extended lifespan on the bather. During Prescot's sojourn among the Savanti an offhand reference is made to the continent of Gah in Kregen's opposite hemisphere, whose distasteful customs are an obvious dig at another sword and planet series, the Gor series of John Norman. Prescot falls from grace among his hosts for supplying forbidden aid to Delia, princess of the island empire of Vallia, who has been brought to the Savanti as an injured supplicant. Defying their decision not to help her, he takes her to the healing pool and cures her. In consequence, he is banished back to Earth. While Prescott spends five years on Earth only a day has passed for Delia, as he later learns. Later, he is returned to Kregen through the agency of the Star Lords, an even more mysterious group of apparently god-like beings, whose motivations are unknown, but apparently in opposition to the human Savanti. Prescot becomes a pawn in the Star Lords' schemes, sent willy-nilly to various locations on the planet to serve their ends and capriciously returned to Earth when his task is done or he manages to offend them. Despite this handicap he usually rises to a position of power in whatever society he is thrust into. Thrown back into contact with Delia, he is even able to renew and further his relationship with her. He eventually becomes the leader of the clansmen of Felschraung and Lord of Strombor in the city of Zenicce and learns that Delia of Delphond is in reality the daughter of the Emperor of Vallia, a powerful island nation. At the moment of triumph however he is returned to Lisbon on Earth. Important locales introduced in this novel include the hidden city of the Savanti, the northern plains of the continent of Segesthes, and the city state of Zenicce on the same continent. It also introduces the dove, used by the Savanti to monitor Dray Prescot, and the Gdoinye, a colourful bird of prey send by the Star Lords for the same task.

American restaurants and workplaces typically offer machine-made drip brew coffee by default, while hot tea brewed by the cup with tea bags is available by requestStern, Tracy \\"Tea Party:20 Themed Tea Parties with recipes for every occasion\\" (2007, Random House). Tea parties can be celebrated for many occasions, from the very small and intimate to the large family gatherings and celebrations. In the U.S. south a regional favorite called sweet tea - which is brewed, sweetened, and chilled in advance of consumption - may be served at all meals and throughout the day as an alternate to other beverages. In the United States, about 85% of the tea consumed is served cold, or iced. Iced tea is more frequently consumed during periods of hot weather or in lower latitudes, and hot tea is likewise more common in colder weather. Any confusion when one is visiting different parts of the country can easily be solved by explicitly asking for either \\"hot tea\\" or \\"iced tea.\\" Afternoon tea, as a meal, is rarely served in the U.S. except in ritualized special occasions such as the tea party or an afternoon out at a high-end hotel or restaurant, which may also offer cream tea on their menu. History Paul Revere holds a silver teapot he has made Advertisement of a Boston tea shop in 1811 listing teas for sale The American tea culture is a part of the history of the United States, as this beverage appeals to all classes and has adapted to the customs of the United States of America. In the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, now known as New York, tea was served with the best silver strainers, the finest porcelain cups and pots, and wooden tea caddies.[Griffiths, John \\"Tea: a history of the drink that changed the world\\" Carlton Publishing Group, 2011] Tea became a very popular drink in the colonies, and tea ceremonies were common among all classes. In Salem, MA, tea leaves were boiled to create a bitter brew, then served as a vegetable side dish with butter. By the time of the American Revolution, tea was drunk everywhere from the backwoods to the cities. At Google Books. The view of tea in American culture began to shift when the British government introduced the Townshend Acts in 1767. Tea was taxed as part of these laws which made it less affordable for the American people. However, cheaper tea was still smuggled into America. Later in 1773 the Tea Act was put into place which allowed the East India Company to gain a monopoly on tea sales in America by being able to sell tea at prices that were cheaper than both the colonial tea importers and smugglers. The British government did this to be able to continue to collect tea taxes from the American colonies. However, the British were unable to hide the tax from the colonies and only managed to enrage the colonists. This led to the Boston Tea Party, where tea was dumped into the Boston Harbor, and other public protests of shipments of tea. As a consequence, tea drinking became unpatriotic. Boycotts of tea led to an increase in consumption of other beverages, such as coffee or herbal teas infused with peppermint, sage or dandelions.(1) (2) At Google Books.

American Tea Masters The American Tea Masters Association was founded to provide mastery- level training, education, and professional certification to individuals desiring to become tea masters and tea sommeliers. Iced tea Iced tea, popular throughout the U.S. Iced tea is usually prepared from bagged tea. In addition to tea bags and loose tea, powdered \\"instant iced tea mix\\" is available in stores. This is made by preparing tea and then dehydrating it, similar to instant coffee. Iced tea can be purchased, like soda, in canned or bottled form at vending machines and convenience stores; usually, this pre- made tea is sweetened with corn syrup, and sometimes some other flavoring, such as lemon or raspberry, is added. Also, like other soft drinks, it can be purchased as a fountain drink, though in some establishments it is pumped from a bag-in-box, and in others, it is simply poured from a separate container that contains freshly brewed tea. In restaurants, iced tea is usually served unsweetened except in the Southeastern United States where iced tea is much more common and is available both sweet and unsweetened and \\"iced tea\\" is often considered to be \\"sweet tea\\" unless otherwise specified. The reason for the presweetening is that it may be difficult to dissolve sugar in iced tea, even with constant stirring. The result can be insufficiently sweetened tea or gritty, undissolved sugar crystals in the tea. Some restaurants have begun serving iced tea that has been pre-flavored with fruit essences, particularly passion fruit, often as the only iced tea made available. Iced tea's popularity in the United States has led to an addition to standard cutlery sets; the iced tea spoon is a standard flatware teaspoon, but with a long handle, suitable for stirring sugar into the taller glasses commonly used for iced tea. Tea bags Tea bags were invented in the United States Thomas Sullivan is credited with inventing tea bags in 1908. Sullivan, a New York tea importer, inadvertently invented tea bags when he sent tea samples to clients in small silk bags to cut costs, and they mistakenly steeped the bags whole. The customers were more interested in the brewing convenience of the novel silk bags than his bulk teas. Sullivan did not realize this until they all started to complain that the orders they received were not in the same small bags the samples had been in. Silk was too expensive for everyday disposal; therefore, he invented tea bags made of gauze. The tea bag made of paper fiber was a later American invention. The nylon pyramidal teabag containing broken teas and semi-leaf teas made an appearance in the marketplace for aficionados. The pyramidal shape - it is said - allows more room for the leaf to steep. Environmentalists prefer silk to nylon because of the health and biodegradable issues.Tea‚Äôs Got a Brand New Bag The New York Times, September 13, 2006. Most tea sold in the United States is sold in bags, although loose leaf teas and iced are also available. Instant tea In 1946, Nestle USA introduced the first instant tea, Nestea. Instant teas are produced from black tea by extracting the liquor from processed portion of tea typically from offgrade black teas; green tea in a smaller proportion has traditionally been used by the instant tea makers as a \\"clarification agent\\" - again, in effort to maximize the clarity of color and minimize off-colors created by certain teas that cloud. The extract is concentrated under low pressure, and drying the concentrate to a powder by freeze-drying, spray-drying, or vacuum-drying. Low temperatures tend to be used to minimize loss of flavor. The American market for instant tea powders, which developed quickly following Nestle's introduction, has slackened off considerably over the past quarter century, as Americans have more and more turned to naturally icing their favorite loose teas, as well as preparing iced tea from tea bags, and to ready-to-drink iced teas where the smaller sizes are found in the supermarkets' refrigerated drinks sections and the larger gallon sizes are found in the supermarkets' non-refrigerated drinks sections. Revival of fine teas Yellow and white teas became difficult to find in the United States and even green tea had become uncommon because of the People's Republic of China's ban on exports to the USA which was lifted in 1971. After the resumption of trade between mainland China and the USA, these teas typical to China re-entered the American market for the first time since the first two decades of the 20th century.History of Tea in the USA In the early 1980s, a mini-revival of demand for better quality teas from all origins occurred in the United States. Prior to this time, much of the tea available in 20th century USA was blended specifically for gallon and half-gallon sized iced tea bags, with the quality of not \\"creaming down\\" (a creamy looking color that imparts to some teas after cooling down) when iced as a needed aspect; \\"clear-liquoring\\" teas were required. Most iced tea blends in the USA have traditionally been made from the teas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Argentina and Malawi. Even though there is no correlation between the quality of cloudy teas versus clear teas, clear iced teas were considered more attractive by the consumer. A recent rise in the demand for orthodox tea in both gallon and half-gallon iced tea bags, as well as 500 and 1,000 gram loose tea packs has caused manufacturers to reinstate orthodox manufacturing methods. This is a departure from the more common Sri Lankan, Indonesian, Argentinian and other nations' orthodox rotorvane tea-making method which has limitations and can not produce whole leaf black tea. The rotorvane method was adopted primarily to satisfy the demand for the smaller leaf sizes that fit into small (1-2 gram) tea bag blends worldwide starting in the early 20th century. =Varieties of teas= A tea shop in Covington, Kentucky selling and serving whole leaf bulk teas and teaware, 2007 Currently, there is a revival of interest in the many varieties of black teas throughout the United States. Additionally, other exotic teas (such as the vast variety of African, Asian and South American teas) and different brewing styles are becoming more commonplace. Teas from all origins and elevations, made in all methods of manufacture, are popular in the USA, a tea market which has traditionally been more flexible and willing to try new types of drinks than tea markets throughout the old world. Decaffeinated tea is widely available in the United States, for those who wish to reduce the physiological effects of caffeine. There are many who are aware that the sales trend for decaf teas in the USA has shown a decreasing curve in demand at retail over the past 20 years, yet the high price of decaf remains unchanged. The reasons are twofold. Not only is decaf tea more expensive than non-decaf tea, the processes of decaffeinating that is commonly used depletes a great deal of the flavor out of the tea.Decaffeinated tea: Is It Safe to Drink? The teas with the highest caffeine content fall far below the coffees with the lowest caffeine content. In this light, and considering that most people would prefer to buy better quality teas rather than the less flavorful decaf teas, the American consumer has been buying decaf tea slightly less in recent years. For those who are caffeine intolerant, however, the invention of decaffeinated tea has been welcomed as a refreshing and tasty alternative to caffeinated beverages. U.S. regional tea traditions =Sweet tea= Sweet tea, with sugar or corn syrup added (usually while the tea is still hot from brewing), the mixture then being cooled with ice, is ubiquitous in the Southeastern United States. In these states, when a person says \\"tea\\", they normally mean sweetened iced tea. The unsweetened variant is often called \\"unsweet\\" tea instead of unsweetened or plain. The consumption of sweet tea with many meals leads to it sometimes called the \\"table wine of the South\\", and this trait is considered an important marker of the culture of the Southern United States. Southern sweet tea is made by brewing tea at double strength, adding a large amount of sugar to the freshly brewed hot tea, and diluting to the proper strength. It is served over a glass full of ice cubes and is often garnished with a slice of lemon. While high fructose corn syrup is commonly used as a sweetener for commercially manufactured tea, more often consumers are unaware of this, and when made at home, refined sugar is used. In the Northern United States and the Western United States, \\"tea\\" generally means the hot beverage and iced tea is referred to by name. =Sun tea= Sun tea brewing Sun tea is frequently brewed in temperate areas by placing tea and room-temperature water together in a glass jar left outdoors in direct sunlight. Steeping times are necessarily long, two to four hours. Tea may also be brewed with no heat at all by simply immersing the tea bags or infuser in room-temperature water and allowing a period of several hours (typically overnight) for steeping. Since sun brewing occurs in a temperature range that can promote the development of bacteria, particularly Alcaligenes viscolactis, the Centers for Disease Control and the Tea Association of the U.S.A. Inc. suggest storing sun-brewed tea in the refrigerator and discarding it after 24 hours. Alcoholic \\"tea\\" The so-called Long Island Iced Tea usually contains no tea; it is an alcoholic cocktail that looks like iced tea. A variant recipe uses actual iced tea as a mixer and is named after a professional golfer; the drink, called John Daly, contains iced or sweet tea, and vodka, and is based on the Arnold Palmer, which contains half iced tea and half lemonade.

Although often viewed as one continuous history, the term hypnosis was coined in the 1880s in France, some twenty years after the death of James Braid, who had adopted the term hypnotism in 1841. Braid adopted the term hypnotism (which specifically applied to the state of the subject, rather than techniques applied by the operator) to contrast his own, unique, subject-centred, approach with those of the operator-centred mesmerists who preceded him. Early history According to Patricia Fanthorpe, hypnosis \\"dates back for millennia.\\" =Temple sleep= According to Will Durant, hypnotism as a tool for health seems to have originated with the Hindus of ancient India, who often took their sick to the temples to be cured by hypnotic suggestion or \\"temple sleep,\\"Will Durant, The Story of Civilisation, Volume 1: Our Oriental Heritage. a practice of staying at night at a temple for meditational self- observance and communication with the gods, called Nidra in India.Shifu Nagaboshi Tomio (1994), The Bodhisattva Warriors: The Origin, Inner Philosophy, History and Symbolism of the Buddhist Martial Art Within India and China, p. 398 =Avicenna= Avicenna (Ibn Sina) (980‚Äì1037), a Persian psychologist and physician, was the earliest to make a distinction between sleep and hypnosis. In The Book of Healing, which he published in 1027, he referred to hypnosis in Arabic as al-Wahm al-Amil, stating that one could create conditions in another person so that he/she accepts the reality of hypnosis. =Post-classical Nigeria= Hypnosis was used in the Nigerian state of Borgu for military purposes, there were specific mixtures to hypnotize the enemy. Magnetism & Mesmerism Hypnotism evolved out of a sometimes skeptical reaction to the much earlier work of magnetists and Mesmerists. = Paracelsus = Paracelsus Paracelsus (1493‚Äì1541), a Swiss, was the first physician to use magnets in his work. Many people claimed to have been healed after he had passed magnets (lodestones) over their bodies. = Valentine Greatrakes = An Irishman by the name of Valentine Greatrakes (1628‚Äì1682) was known as \\"the Great Irish Stroker\\" for his ability to heal people by laying his hands on them and passing magnets over their bodies. = Johann Joseph Gassner = Johann Joseph Gassner (1727‚Äì1779), a Catholic priest of the time, believed that disease was caused by evil spirits and could be exorcised by incantations and prayer. = Father Maximilian Hell = Around 1771, a Viennese Jesuit named Maximilian Hell (1720‚Äì1792) was using magnets to heal by applying steel plates to the naked body. One of Father Hell's students was a young medical doctor from Vienna named Franz Anton Mesmer. = Franz Anton Mesmer = Mesmer Western scientists first became involved in hypnosis around 1770, when Franz Mesmer (1734‚Äì1815), a physician from Austria, started investigating an effect he called \\"animal magnetism\\" or \\"mesmerism\\" (the latter name still remaining popular today). The use of the (conventional) English term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer's magn√©tisme animal can be misleading and needs to be seen in this context: * Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those referred to at the time as mineral magnetism, cosmic magnetism and planetary magnetism. * Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of animals, including humans. Mesmer developed his own theory and was himself inspired by the writings of the English physician Richard Mead, the father of our understanding of transmissible diseases. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient's vein and letting the patient bleed for a while, passing magnets over the wound appeared to be an active force making the bleeding stop. Mesmer additionally discovered that using a stick instead also \\"worked.\\" After moving to Paris and becoming popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier, Benjamin Franklin, and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control named Joseph Ignace Guillotin. Mesmer refused to cooperate with the investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d'Eslon. Franklin constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been \\"magnetised\\" by d'Eslon. This is considered perhaps the first placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination.H.F. Ellenberger, The Discovery of the Unconscious, Basic Books, 1980. Although Mesmerism remained popular and \\"magnetic therapies\\" are still advertised as a form of \\"alternative medicine\\" even today, Mesmer himself retired to Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815. = Abb√© Faria = Abb√© Faria Many of the original mesmerists were signatories to the first declarations that proclaimed the French revolution in 1789. Far from surprising, this could perhaps be expected, in that mesmerism opened up the prospect that the social order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during the Revolution and the Empire. An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb√© Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early 19th century, Abb√© Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris. Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use of Mesmer's baquet (medical). Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that hypnosis 'generated from within the mind‚Äô by the power of expectancy and cooperation of the patient. Faria's approach was significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of Hippolyte Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault of the Nancy School. Faria's theoretical position, and the subsequent experiences of those in the Nancy School, made significant contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of √âmile Cou√© and the autogenic training techniques of Johannes Heinrich Schultz. De Puys√©gur = Marquis de Puys√©gur = A student of Mesmer, Marquis de Puys√©gur, first described and coined the term for \\"somnambulism.\\" Followers of Puys√©gur called themselves \\"Experimentalists\\" and believed in the Paracelsus-Mesmer fluidism theory. = R√©camier and Reichenbach = Reichenbach R√©camier, in 1821, prior to the development of hypnotism, was the first physician known to have used something resembling hypnoanesthesia and operated on patients under mesmeric coma. In the 1840s and 1850s, Carl Reichenbach began experiments to find any scientific validity to \\"mesmeric\\" energy, which he called Odic force after the Norse god Odin. Although his conclusions were quickly rejected in the scientific community, they did undermine Mesmer's claims of mind control. In 1846, James Braid published an influential article, The Power of the Mind over the Body, attacking Reichenbach's views as pseudoscientific. = James Esdaile = James Esdaile (1805‚Äì1859) reported on 345 major operations performed using mesmeric sleep as the sole anesthetic in British India. The development of chemical anesthetics soon saw the replacement of hypnotism in this role. = John Elliotson = John Elliotson (1791‚Äì1868), an English surgeon, in 1834 reported numerous painless surgical operations that had been performed using mesmerism. 19th century hypnotism =James Braid= Hypnotism and monoideism James Braid The Scottish surgeon James Braid coined the term \\"hypnotism\\" in his unpublished Practical Essay on the Curative Agency of Neuro-Hypnotism (1842) as an abbreviation for \\"neuro-hypnotism,\\" meaning \\"sleep of the nerves.\\" Braid fiercely opposed the views of the Mesmerists, especially the claim that their effects were due to an invisible force called \\"animal magnetism,\\" and the claim that their subjects developed paranormal powers such as telepathy. Instead, Braid adopted a skeptical position, influenced by the philosophical school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, attempting to explain the Mesmeric phenomena on the basis of well- established laws of psychology and physiology. Hence, Braid is regarded by many as the first true \\"hypnotist\\" as opposed to the Mesmerists and other magnetists who preceded him. Braid ascribed the \\"mesmeric trance\\" to a physiological process resulting from prolonged attention to a bright moving object or similar object of fixation. He postulated that \\"protracted ocular fixation\\" fatigued certain parts of the brain and caused a trance ‚Äì a \\"nervous sleep\\" or \\"neuro-hypnosis.\\" Later Braid simplified the name to \\"hypnotism\\" (from the Greek ·ΩïœÄŒΩŒøœÇ hypnos, \\"sleep\\"). Finally, realizing that \\"hypnotism\\" was not a kind of sleep, he sought to change the name to \\"monoideism\\" (\\"single-thought-ism\\"), based on a view centred on the notion of a single, dominant idea; but the term \\"hypnotism\\" and its later, misleading (circa 1885) Nancy-centred derivative \\"hypnosis,\\" have persisted. Braid is credited with writing the first ever book on hypnotism, Neurypnology (1843). After Braid's death in 1860, interest in hypnotism temporarily waned, and gradually shifted from Britain to France, where research began to grow, reaching its peak around the 1880s with the work of Hippolyte Bernheim and Jean-Martin Charcot. Braid on Yoga According to his writings, Braid began to hear reports concerning the practices of various meditation techniques immediately after the publication of his major book on hypnotism, Neurypnology (1843). Braid first discusses hypnotism's historical precursors in a series of articles entitled Magic, Mesmerism, Hypnotism, etc., Historically & Physiologically Considered. He draws analogies between his own practice of hypnotism and various forms of Hindu yoga meditation and other ancient spiritual practices. Braid's interest in meditation really developed when he was introduced to the DabistƒÅn-i MazƒÅhib, the \\"School of Religions\\", an ancient Persian text describing a wide variety of Oriental religious practices: Although he disputed the religious interpretation given to these phenomena throughout this article and elsewhere in his writings, Braid seized upon these accounts of Oriental meditation as proof that the effects of hypnotism could be produced in solitude, without the presence of a magnetiser, and therefore saw this as evidence that the real precursor of hypnotism was the ancient practices of meditation rather than in the more recent theory and practice of Mesmerism. As he later wrote, = Holy See = Objections had been raised by some theologians stating that, if not applied properly, hypnosis could deprive a person of their faculty of reason. Saint Thomas Aquinas specifically rebutted this, stating that \\"The loss of reason is not a sin in itself but only by reason of the act by which one is deprived of the use of reason. If the act that deprives one of his use of reason is licit in itself and is done for a just cause, there is no sin; if no just cause is present, it must be considered a venial sin.\\" On 28 July 1847, a decree from the Sacred Congregation of the Holy office (Roman Curia) declared that \\"Having removed all misconception, foretelling of the future, explicit or implicit invocation of the devil, the use of animal magnetism (Hypnosis) is indeed merely an act of making use of physical media that are otherwise licit and hence it is not morally forbidden, provided it does not tend toward an illicit end or toward anything depraved.\\" = American Civil War = Hypnosis was used by field doctors in the American Civil War and was one of the first extensive medical application of hypnosis. Although hypnosis seemed effective in the field, with the introduction of the hypodermic needle and the general chemical anesthetics of ether in 1846 and chloroform in 1847 to America, it was much easier for the war's medical community to use chemical anesthesia than hypnosis. = Jean- Martin Charcot = Jean-Martin Charcot The neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825‚Äì1893) endorsed hypnotism for the treatment of hysteria. La m√©thode num√©rique (\\"The numerical method\\") led to a number of systematic experimental examinations of hypnosis in France, Germany, and Switzerland. The process of post-hypnotic suggestion was first described in this period. Extraordinary improvements in sensory acuity and memory were reported under hypnosis. From the 1880s the examination of hypnosis passed from surgical doctors to mental health professionals. Charcot had led the way and his study was continued by his pupil, Pierre Janet. Janet described the theory of dissociation, the splitting of mental aspects under hypnosis (or hysteria) so skills and memory could be made inaccessible or recovered. Janet provoked interest in the subconscious and laid the framework for reintegration therapy for dissociated personalities. Charcot demonstrating hypnosis on a \\"hysterical\\" Salp√™tri√®re patient, \\"Blanche\\" (Marie Wittman), who is supported by Joseph Babi≈Ñski.See: A Clinical Lesson at the Salp√™tri√®re. = Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault = Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault (1864‚Äì1904), the founder of the Nancy School, first wrote of the necessity for cooperation between the hypnotizer and the participant, for rapport. Along with Bernheim, he emphasized the importance of suggestibility. = Hippolyte Bernheim = Some experts consider Hippolyte Bernheim the most important figure in the history of hypnotism.Weitzenhoffer, A. (2000). The Practice of Hypnotism. Along with Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault he founded the Nancy School, which became the dominant force in hypnotherapeutic theory and practice in the last two decades of the 19th century. = William James = William James (1842‚Äì1910), the pioneering American psychologist, discussed hypnosis in some detail in his Principles of Psychology. = First International Congress, 1889 = The First International Congress for Experimental and Therapeutic Hypnotism was held in Paris, France, on 8‚Äì12 August 1889. Attendees included Jean-Martin Charcot, Hippolyte Bernheim, Sigmund Freud and Ambroise-Auguste Li√©beault. The second congress was held on 12‚Äì16 August 1900. = British Medical Association, 1892 = The Annual Meeting of the BMA, in 1892, unanimously endorsed the therapeutic use of hypnosis and rejects the theory of Mesmerism (animal magnetism). Even though the BMA recognized the validity of hypnosis, Medical Schools and Universities largely ignored the subject. 20th century hypnotism = Emile Cou√© = Emile Cou√© (1857‚Äì1926), a French pharmacist ‚Äì and, according to Charles Baudouin, the founder of the \\"New Nancy School\\"Baudouin, C. (Paul, E & Paul, C. trans.), Suggestion and Autosuggestion: A Psychological and Pedagogical Study Based on the Investigations made by the New Nancy School, George Allen & Unwin, (London), 1920, p. 13.It is significant that Cou√© never adopted Baudouin‚Äôs designation \\"New Nancy School\\"; and, moreover, according to Bernard Glueck has ‚Äì Glueck, B., \\"New Nancy School\\", The Psychoanalytic Review, Vol. 10, (January 1923), pp. 109‚Äì12; at p. 112 ‚Äì who had visited Cou√© at Nancy in 1922, Cou√© was \\"rather annoyed\\" with Baudouin‚Äôs unauthorized characterization of his enterprise. ‚Äì having studied with Li√©beault in 1885 and 1886, discarded the 'hypnosis' of Bernheim and Li√©beault (c. 1886), adopted the 'hypnotism' of Braid (c. 1901), and created what became known as the Cou√© method (la m√©thode Cou√©), centred on the promotion of conscious autosuggestion.See Yeates, Lindsay B. (2016a), \\"√âmile Cou√© and his Method (I): The Chemist of Thought and Human Action\\", Australian Journal of Clinical Hypnotherapy & Hypnosis, Volume 38, No. 1, (Autumn 2016), pp. 3‚Äì27; (2016b), \\"√âmile Cou√© and his Method (II): Hypnotism, Suggestion, Ego-Strengthening, and Autosuggestion\\", Australian Journal of Clinical Hypnotherapy & Hypnosis, Volume 38, No. 1, (Autumn 2016), pp. 28‚Äì54; and (2016c), \\"√âmile Cou√© and his Method (III): Every Day in Every Way\\", Australian Journal of Clinical Hypnotherapy & Hypnosis, Volume 38, No. 1, (Autumn 2016), pp. 55‚Äì79. His method was an ordered sequence of rational, systematic, intricately constructed, subject-centred hypnotherapeutic interactions that stressed the significance of both unconscious and conscious autosuggestion, delivered a collection of well-polished common-sense explanations, a persuasive set of experiential exercises, a powerfully efficacious hypnotism-centred ego-strengthening intervention and, finally, detailed instruction in the specific ritual through which his empirically determined formula \\"Every day, in every way, I‚Äôm getting better and better\\" was to be self-administered twice daily. Much of the work of early 20th century self-help teachers (such as Norman Vincent Peale, Robert H. Schuller, and W. Clement Stone) was derived from that of Cou√©. = Boris Sidis = Boris Sidis Boris Sidis (1867‚Äì1923), a Ukraine-born American psychologist and psychiatrist who studied under William James at Harvard University, formulated this law of suggestion: :Suggestibility varies as the amount of disaggregation, and inversely as the unification of consciousness. Disaggregation refers to the split between the normal waking consciousness and the subconscious. = Johannes Schultz = The German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz adapted the theories of Abbe Faria and Emile Cou√©, identifying certain parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation. He called his system of self- hypnosis Autogenic training. = Gustave Le Bon = Gustave Le Bon's study of crowd psychology compared the effects of a leader of a group to hypnosis. Le Bon made use of the suggestibility concept. = Sigmund Freud = Hypnosis, which at the end of the 19th century had become a popular phenomenon, in particular due to Charcot's public hypnotism sessions, was crucial in the invention of psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud, a student of Charcot. Freud later witnessed a small number of the experiments of Li√©beault and Hippolyte Bernheim in Nancy. Back in Vienna he developed abreaction therapy using hypnosis with Josef Breuer. When Sigmund Freud discounted its use in psychiatry, in the first half of the last century, stage hypnotists kept it alive more than physicians. =Platanov and Pavlov= Russian medicine has had extensive experience with obstetric hypnosis. Platanov, in the 1920s, became well known for his hypno-obstetric successes. Impressed by this approach, Stalin later set up a nationwide program headed by Velvoski, who originally combined hypnosis with Pavlov's techniques, but eventually used the latter almost exclusively. Fernand Lamaze, having visited Russia, brought back to France \\"childbirth without pain through the psychological method,\\" which in turn showed more reflexologic than hypnotic inspiration. = 20th century wars = The use of hypnosis in the treatment of neuroses flourished in World War I, World War II and the Korean War. Hypnosis techniques were merged with psychiatry and was especially useful in the treatment of what is known today as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. = William McDougall = William McDougall (1871‚Äì1944), an English psychologist, treated soldiers with \\"shell shock\\" and criticised certain aspects of Freudian theory such as the concept of abreaction. = Clark L. Hull = The modern study of hypnotism is usually considered to have begun in the 1920s with Clark Leonard Hull (1884‚Äì1952) at Yale University. An experimental psychologist, his work Hypnosis and Suggestibility (1933) was a rigorous study of the phenomenon, using statistical and experimental analysis. Hull's studies emphatically demonstrated once and for all that hypnosis had no connection with sleep (\\"hypnosis is not sleep, ‚Ä¶ it has no special relationship to sleep, and the whole concept of sleep when applied to hypnosis obscures the situation\\"). The main result of Hull's study was to rein in the extravagant claims of hypnotists, especially regarding extraordinary improvements in cognition or the senses under hypnosis. Hull's experiments showed the reality of some classical phenomena such as mentally induced pain reduction and apparent inhibition of memory recall. However, Clark's work made clear that these effects could be achieved without hypnosis being seen as a distinct state, but rather as a result of suggestion and motivation, which was a forerunner of the behavioural approach to hypnosis. Similarly, moderate increases in certain physical capacities and changes to the threshold of sensory stimulation could be induced psychologically; attenuation effects could be especially dramatic. = Andrew Salter = In the 1940s, Andrew Salter (1914‚Äì1996) introduced to American therapy the Pavlovian method of contradicting, opposing, and attacking beliefs. In the conditioned reflex, he has found what he saw as the essence of hypnosis. He thus gave a rebirth to hypnotism by combining it with classical conditioning. Ivan Pavlov had himself induced an altered state in pigeons, that he referred to as \\"Cortical Inhibition,\\" which some later theorists believe was some form of hypnotic state. = British Hypnotism Act = In the United Kingdom, the Hypnotism Act 1952 was instituted to regulate stage hypnotists' public entertainments. = British Medical Association, 1955 = On 23 April 1955, the British Medical Association (BMA) approved the use of hypnosis in the areas of psychoneuroses and hypnoanesthesia in pain management in childbirth and surgery. At this time, the BMA also advised all physicians and medical students to receive fundamental training in hypnosis. =1956, Pope's approval of hypnosis= The Roman Catholic Church banned hypnotism until the mid-20th century when, in 1956, Pope Pius XII gave his approval of hypnosis. He stated that the use of hypnosis by health care professionals for diagnosis and treatment is permitted. In an address from the Vatican on hypnosis in childbirth, the Pope gave these guidelines: # Hypnotism is a serious matter, and not something to dabble in. # In its scientific use, the precautions dictated by both science and morality must be followed. # Under the aspect of anaesthesia, it is governed by the same principles as other forms of anaesthesia. = American Medical Association, 1958 = In 1958, the American Medical Association approved a report on the medical uses of hypnosis. It encouraged research on hypnosis although pointing out that some aspects of hypnosis are unknown and controversial. However, in June 1987, the AMA's policy-making body rescinded all AMA policies from 1881‚Äì1958 (other than two not relating to hypnosis). = American Psychological Association = Two years after AMA approval, the American Psychological Association endorsed hypnosis as a branch of psychology. =Ernest Hilgard and others= Studies continued after the Second World War. Barber, Hilgard, Orne and Sarbin also produced substantial studies. In 1961, Ernest Hilgard and Andr√© Muller Weitzenhoffer created the Stanford scales, a standardized scale for susceptibility to hypnosis, and properly examined susceptibility across age- groups and sex. Hilgard went on to study sensory deception (1965) and induced anesthesia and analgesia (1975). = Dave Elman = Dave Elman (1900‚Äì1967) helped to promote the medical use of hypnosis from 1949 until his heart attack in 1962. Elman's definition of hypnosis is still used today by professional hypnotherapists. Although Elman had no medical training, Gil Boyne (a major teacher of hypnosis) repeatedly stated that Dave Elman trained more physicians and dentists in the use of hypnotism than anyone else in the United States. Dave Elman is also known for introducing rapid inductions to the field of hypnotism. An induction method he introduced over fifty years ago is still one of the favored inductions used by many of today's practitioners. He placed great stress on what he called \\"the Esdaile state\\" or the \\"hypnotic coma,\\" which, according to Elman, had not been deliberately induced since Scottish surgeon James Esdaile last attained it. This was an unfortunate and historically inaccurate choice of terminology on Elman's part. Esdaile never used what we now call hypnosis even on a single occasion; he used something loosely resembling mesmerism (also known as animal magnetism). =Ormond McGill= Ormond McGill (1913‚Äì2005), stage hypnotist and hypnotherapist, was the \\"Dean of American Hypnotists\\" and writer of the seminal \\"Encyclopedia of Genuine Stage Hypnotism\\" (1947). = U.S. definition for hypnotherapist = The U.S. (Department of Labor) Directory of Occupational Titles (D.O.T. 079.157.010) supplies the following definition: :\\"Hypnotherapist ‚Äì Induces hypnotic state in client to increase motivation or alter behavior pattern through hypnosis. Consults with client to determine the nature of problem. Prepares client to enter hypnotic states by explaining how hypnosis works and what client will experience. Tests subject to determine degrees of physical and emotional suggestibility. Induces hypnotic state in client using individualized methods and techniques of hypnosis based on interpretation of test results and analysis of client's problem. May train client in self- hypnosis conditioning. Some states hold the term \\"Therapist\\" to be licensed medical professionals. Therefore, using this term and not being a licensed professional would be practicing without a license.\\" = UK National Occupational Standards = National Occupational Standards (NOS) for Hypnotherapy was published in 2002 by Skills for Health, the Government's Sector Skills Council for the UK health industry. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority started conferring optional certificates and diplomas in international level through National Awarding Bodies by assessing learning outcomes of training/accrediting-prior-experiential-learning. = Indian restriction = The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, in its letter no.R.14015/25/96-U&H;(R) (Pt.) dated 25 November 2003, has categorically stated that hypnotherapy is a recommended mode of therapy in India, to be practiced only by appropriately trained personnel. Contemporary researchers = Nicholas Spanos = Nicholas Spanos, who died in 1994, was Professor of Psychology and Director of the Laboratory for Experimental Hypnosis at Carleton University and a leading nonstate theorist and hypnotic skills training researcher. =Martin Orne= Martin Theodore Orne was a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania who researched demand characteristics and hypnosis.

It is located on a fertile high plain, northwest of Madrid at an elevation of . Toro is known as a center of Mud√©jar art and as a wine-producing region. It is located on the Duero River roughly halfway between Zamora, the provincial capital and Tordesillas in the province of Valladolid. The four-lane freeway (autov√≠a) A-11 now connects these two cities and passes just north of Toro. Highway N122 passes through the town. The distance to Madrid by highway is . Distances to other cities are: to Zamora, to Valladolid and to Salamanca. History =Antiquity= Toro is an ancient town, possibly the Arbukala of the Vaccai tribe which was conquered by Hannibal in 220 BC but survived to trouble the Romans. The Roman town was called Albucella. The modern name may derive from the bull totem of that Celtiberian people. In the 8th century it was conquered by the Moors. After the Muslims had been partially rolled back, Alfonso III repopulated the town in about 910. =Medieval= Ferdinand III was crowned King of Le√≥n in Toro in 1230 and his wife Elisabeth of Hohenstaufen (Beatriz) died here. Enrique II, first of the Trast√°mara line, summoned his first Cortes here in 1369. Juan II of Castile was born here in 1404, but the town was to have greater significance for his daughter Isabella I of Castile. Isabella (married with Ferdinand) had a rival for the succession in Juana la Beltraneja, supposedly the daughter of her half-brother Enrique IV, but allegedly the daughter of the queen's lover, the courtier Beltr√°n de la Cueva. La Beltraneja's supporters arranged her betrothal to Alfonso V of Portugal who was feeling upset over his earlier rejection by Isabella. A street in Toro with the Torre del Reloj at background. Alfonso invaded Castile in May 1475, backed by a number of dissident Castilian nobles. Isabella made Tordesillas her headquarters, while Ferdinand moved to secure the loyalty of Salamanca, Toro, and Zamora. Alfonso reached Ar√©valo in July and both Zamora and Toro went over to him, a serious blow for the young monarchs. Intrigue seethed as troops marched. Zamora swung back to Isabella's cause. The Portuguese crown prince arrived with reinforcements and on March 1, 1476 the rival armies met at Peleagonzalo, a few kilometres southwest of Toro. Ferdinand was victorious in this battle decided by light cavalry. The Portuguese under Alfonso broke and the king took refuge in Castronu√±o.

But the fortress of Zamora surrendered to Ferdinand soon thereafter (March 19, 1476) while Toro remained in Portuguese hands during more than half a year (until September 19, 1476). After that Alfonso gave up the fight and la Beltraneja retired to a Lisbon convent where she died in 1530, aged sixty-eight.

Isabella's legal successors in Castile were her daughter Joanna the Mad and her husband Philip the Handsome, who at the time stayed in the Netherlands. The Cortes took the oath to Ferdinand as temporary ruler and agreed that if Juana be deemed incurably ill, which she showed every sign of being, he should become regent. When the pair reached Spain in the spring of 1506, the two men agreed that Juana was incapable of ruling. Ferdinand turned over the sole rule to her husband Philip the Handsome and left for Kingdom of Aragon. Less than three months later, Philip was dead. Juana became totally insane and in August 1508 ceded her rights to her father and was retired to Tordesillas. =1500 to present= When in 1520 the towns of Castile, the Comuneros, rose against her son Charles I, who had succeeded his Spanish grandfather in 1516, Toro sided with them. Charles defeated the Comuneros at Villalar de los Comuneros, east of Toro, the next year. During the Peninsular War, in the bitter cold of December 1808, Sir John Moore began his retreat from Toro in the face of superior French forces. The ghastly ordeal ended in Moore's death before A Coru√±a (Galicia) in January. In May 1813, 100,000 British troops gathered in Toro under Wellington's command and from here Wellington launched the final campaign which expelled Napoleon's armies from Spanish soil after five terrible years. English traveller Richard Ford visited Toro in 1831 and reported a population of 9,000; it has just under 10,000 now. In 1838 it lost its status as a provincial capital, its province being merged with Zamora. Main sights San Salvador church. The town of Toro is built in the shape of a fan, in whose center stands the Collegiate church of Santa Mar√≠a la Mayor, dating to the 12th century. Outstanding on the outside is the polychrome western door, called ; and on the inside, the famous Flemish painting La Virgen de la Mosca (\\"Virgin of the Fly\\") and an unusual pregnant Virgin. Next to the collegiate church is the Espol√≥n viewing point, which offers views of a fertile plain known as the \\"oasis of Castile.\\" The town also has the remains of a wall from 910 AD; and the gates of Corredera and Santa Catalina, from the 17th and 18th centuries. Noteworthy civic buildings include the fa√ßade of the Law Palace, the City Hall, and the palaces of the Counts of Requena, the Marquis of Alca√±ices or the Marquis of Castrillo. Among the ecclesiastical buildings are the churches of San Lorenzo el Real, in Mud√©jar style; San Salvador de los Caballeros, which contains a Museum of Religious Art; San Sebasti√°n, and the monasteries of Sancti Spiritus, Santa Clara and Santa Sof√≠a. Notable inhabitants *Jes√∫s L√≥pez-Cobos, conductor (b. 1940) Toro wine Toro has been long famous for its wine (Toro (DO)). The Toro wines were so prestigious that King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n conceded privileges for its production in the 12th Century. Columbus took Toro wine with him on the expedition to discover America in 1492, because it could survive large journeys, due to its structure and body. Friar Diego de Deza, from Zamora, one of Isabel the Catholic's confessors, collaborated economically in the expedition, for which he was allowed to name one of the caravels, the Pinta that was half full of Toro wine.

Voorhees was born in Highland Park, New Jersey. Early life During World War II, he left his studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to join the United States Navy as an officer in what was called the \\"Underwater Demolition Team 11\\" (UDT-11), a precursor to the U.S. Navy SEALs. He spent much of the war mapping shoreline defenses in the Pacific. After the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Voorhees' unit was sent in to inspect the city, making him one of the first Americans to see the bomb's aftermath. For his military service he received the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and the Presidential Unit Citation. After the war, Voorhees continued his education, graduating from RPI in 1947 and then earning his master's degree in city planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1949. Transportation planning In 1952, Voorhees came to Washington, D.C. to work for the nonprofit Automobile Safety Foundation. While studying traffic in Baltimore, Voorhees developed a mathematical formula to predict traffic patterns based on land use. This formula has been instrumental in the design of numerous transportation and public works projects around the world. He wrote \\"A General Theory of Traffic Movement\\" (1956), which applied the gravity model to trip distribution, which translates trips generated in an area to a matrix that identifies the number of trips from each origin to each destination, which can then be loaded onto the network. In 1961, he began his own engineering firm (Alan M. Voorhees & Associates) which eventually grew to have branches in ten U.S. cities. He was involved in the design of many subway systems including those in S√£o Paulo, Hong Kong, Caracas, and Washington, D.C.. Voorhees is credited with the concept for the Canberra 'Y Plan', linking Australia's capital city with new townships of roads and public transport. Research on this proposal began in 1966 and the final report was presented in 1969. Voorhees sold his firm in 1967 and became the dean of the College of Architecture, Art and Urban Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle in 1971. The firm went on to be project manager of the Boston Transportation Planning Review. Voorhees invested in Micros Corporation and its electronic cash register in the late 1960s. Voorhees designed the street grid for land that was reclaimed in lower Manhattan in New York City, connecting new streets to centuries-old already existing roads and to the Brooklyn Bridge. He was also one of the early designers of the United States' Interstate Highway System and helped determine how the highways would cut through or bypass urban areas. Later life In 1979, following airline deregulation, Voorhees helped found Atlantic Southeast Airlines, which was later bought by Delta Air Lines. Voorhees received the first Harland Bartholomew Award of the American Society of Civil Engineers as the engineer who has contributed most to urban planning, and was honored with the establishment of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University in 1998, and helped found the Voorhees Computing Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He was chairman of the board of Autometric Corp., an aerospace company based in Northern Virginia. Autometric was later sold to Boeing. He was an angel investor of Lizardtech, the software of which was excellent for digital mapping and GIS purposes. Voorhees was an early investor in MICROS Systems, which sold to Oracle Corporation in 2014 for $5.3 billion. Voorhees was an avid collector of historical maps, amassing an impressive collection of over 300 maps focused on the history of Virginia. He donated this valuable collection, worth millions of dollars, to the Library of Congress, the Library of Virginia, and the Virginia Historical Society. Voorhees believed government could greatly improve the human condition, and was an early supporter of the Council for Excellence in Government. Voorhees was heavily involved with the Voorhees College, an Historical Black College in Denmark, SC. Voorhees often provided funding for campus improvement projects as well as scholarship funds for the students. Voorhees and his family helped start the successful and family-oriented Westmoreland Berry Farm, located in the Northern Neck of Virginia. In the late 1990s, Voorhees started a project to automate county government services in Richmond County, Virginia. The system he supported involved scanning thousands of land records in the county clerk's office and connecting these with data from the county planning office (topo maps, sewer and water overlays, satellite views, etc.) and tax office. The land records were then sent via the Internet to be archived at the Library of Virginia. He spent over $600,000 on this project. Voorhees was concerned with environmental protection. He donated over of land along the Rappahannock river in Virginia to become the Voorhees nature preserve.Voorhees Nature Preserve . The Nature Conservancy. His interest in government automation was designed to make it easier to identify environmentally sensitive areas and ensure that development took them into account. Voorhees died in a hotel he owned in Richmond, Virginia from an apparent stroke at the age of 83.

Its name stands for \\"Simplified Acute Physiology Score\\" and is a supplement to the SAPS II scoring system. It has been designed to provide a real-life predicted mortality for a patient by following a well defined procedure, based on a mathematical model that needs calibration. Predicted mortalities are good when comparing groups of patients, and having near-real- life mortalities means, that this scoring system can answer questions like \\"if the patients from hospital A had been in hospital B, what would their mortality have been?\\". However, in order to achieve this functionality, you must calibrate the system, which is additional effort, and it is difficult to compare two groups of patients if they were not scored using the same calibration. SAPS III is therefore not suitable by itself for publishing data about the morbidity of a single group of patients. The SAPS III project is conducted by the SAPS III Outcomes Research Group (SORG). Some shared calibrations make it possible to calculate a calibration-specific SAPS III score using paper forms. DID SAPS III The Danish Intensive care Database (DID) has a standard-form to calculate SAPS III scores for their specific purpose, and require participating ICUs to provide: * Age * Length of hospital stay before admission to the ICU * What kind of department did the patient arrive from * A checklist of specific diagnoses that the patient has had * Earlier treatments using vasoactive drugs * Was the patient admitted acutely or planned? * A checklist of why the patient was admitted to the ICU * Surgery: Acute surgery, planned surgery or no surgery * Type of surgery * Acute infections at admission * Estimated Glasgow Coma Score * Serum Bilirubin * Body temperature * Serum Creatinine * Heart Rate * Leukocyte count * pH * Thrombocyte (platelet) count * Systolic blood pressure * Oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 and PaO2, ventilation) Each of these values are given points based on value intervals, similar to SAPS II, and a score is calculated.

His works include the docudrama Son of the Northeast. Biography =Early career= Vichit graduated from Vajiravudh College in 1946 and started working as a journalist under the pen name Kounavudhi. He got into filmmaking in 1950, when he was offered the villain's role in Fa Kamnod. He then started working as a screenwriter, writing the dialogue for an adaptation of Wannaboon Withayakom's Phrom Bandan. His first screenplay was Santi-Weena, an acclaimed drama directed by Tawee \\"Kru Marut\\" Na Bangchang. It went on to competition in the 1955 Asia Film Festival in Tokyo, where it won several awards, including best cinematography for cinematographer Rattana Pestonji. Vichit started directing in 1958 and made 23 films until he retired in 1989. He had a string of action films in the 1960s and early '70s. Several starred legendary leading man Mitr Chaibancha. He also made several films with actor Adul Dulyarat. =Later films= In the 1970s, Vichit was among the filmmakers who highlighted social problems in their films. His 1978 drama, Mia Luang, or First Wife, examined the issue of men taking mistresses or a mia noi (second wife). His next film, 1979's Khon Phukao, or Mountain People, was an adventure tale about a young hill-tribe couple. It included a documentary-style introduction of the various ethnic groups in northern Thailand. Look Isan, or Son of the Northeast was shot in a similar documentary style to Mountain People. Set in Thailand's rural northeast in the 1930s, Look Isan is a sympathetic depiction of a hard- scrabble life, with vivid wildlife photography and some rousing action sequences. It is regarded as Vichet's best film. His 1985 film, Her Name is Boonrawd, was a look back at the Vietnam War days and the prostitution scene around Utapao air base, where US Air Force troops were based. In it, a spirited young woman struggles to earn an honest living and find true love with one of the American officers. In 1983, Vichit was awarded an honorary doctorate in Communication Arts by Chulalongkorn University and was honored in 1987 by Thailand's National Culture Commission as a National Artist. =Legacy= In 2005, the Bangkok International Film Festival included four films by Vichit in a retrospective: First Wife, Mountain People, Son of the Northeast and Her Name is Boonrawd. The festival also gave its annual Lifetime Achievement Award to Vichit, presenting it to his widow. The festival program noted that: \\"Vichit Kounavudhi is regarded today as a master of the Thai motion picture industry - one of the greatest inspirations to later generations of filmmakers, praised as a genius of directing, screenwriting and editing.

Life Buys was born in a wealthy family in Amersfoort in the province of Utrecht. He studied law in France and worked as lawyer at the court of Holland for a few years. In 1561, he became pensionary of Leiden. Later on he also became 'hoogheemraad' (the chief official) of the 'Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland' (Dutch constitutional body for the security of dikes and polders against the sea and the rivers) of Rhineland (the area around Leiden). Pensionaries were well paid. His task was to advise the city council on legal affairs and serve as the representative of Leiden at the estates of Holland. Paulus Buys was appointed as land's advocate of Holland in 1572 before Calvinists took the county. As representative of Holland, he vetoed the decision of the duke of Alva to raise taxes at the estates general of the Netherlands in Brussels. Because of this, he had to flee from the Netherlands and joined Prince William of Orange in Arnstadt. Paulus Buys was Roman Catholic, but he, like many moderate Catholics, joined the rebels (Protestantism was a minority faith in Holland at that time) and secretly helped raising armies for the cause of the prince when he came back to Leiden in the same year. He refused to admit a Spanish garrison in Leiden. Leiden became a part of rebel territory still in 1572. Buys became the head of the rebel 'Raad van State' (one of the constitutional bodies of the Netherlands) in 1573, which would make him the rebel leader if William of Orange died at the siege of Haarlem. The prince did not go to Haarlem, which fell to the Spanish. Buys was the leader of the inundations (opening of dikes to let the water of the sea in) during the siege of Leiden in 1574. The water drowned the Spanish cannons, so the Spanish had to lift the siege. He was the leader of the reconstruction of Leiden and appealed to the prince of Orange to establish the Leiden University. He was curator of the university. In 1575, he went to England to try to convince Elizabeth I of England to ally with rebel Holland and the prince of Orange. Elizabeth refused. Paulus Buys was one of the founders of the Union of Utrecht in 1579, which made an end to the Union of Brussels, which was founded by the prince of Orange. Prince William of Orange was killed in 1584. Paulus Buys lost his mainstay and left the estates of Holland, probably because he thought that they were overly supportive of France. Buys was an advocate of the English, and he became the chief adviserBruce p. xlii of the Earl of Leicester, when the latter was sent to the Netherlands to aid the rebels with an English army. Leicester first supported Buys against political rivals,Bruce p. 33 but within two months fell out with him. As Elizabeth I seemed to drawback her support for the Dutch, Leicester was convinced that Buys intrigued against him behind his back.Bruce p. 130 Buys was arrested in July 1586 by the town of Utrecht, to Leicester's contentment.Bruce p. 352 Many cities asked for his release, but he remained imprisoned for half a year and was released after the payment of a very large amount of money as ransom. This was the end of his political career. He lost his last profession as curator of Leiden university in 1591, because of his authoritarian behaviour. He sold his possessions in Leiden and moved to IJsselstein, where he died in 1594. Family His son is most likely Cornelis Buys (*1559), who inherited the manors Capelle ter Vliet and Zevenhoven in 1592 - the year Paulus Buys died. Cornelis Buys was a member of the General Chamber of Auditors of the County Holland and also a court clerk there. It is not known when Cornelis Buys died.

It is currently owned by Albertsons LLC. It is a no-frills grocery store where the customers bag their own groceries at the checkout. History =Acme version= Super Saver was a brand launched by the Acme grocery chain in 1970 on the East Coast as discount format grocery stores. The format was established in order to compete with lower priced grocery retailers such as ShopRite and Pathmark (competitors which did not offer trading stamps). The brand was retired in 1982 (though some isolated stores retained the signage into the early 1990s). =American Stores version= American Stores logo In 1994, American Stores Company, parent company of Acme and Lucky food stores decided to start a discount format grocery store chain in California. They built new stores in Southern California (Indio, Oceanside, Anaheim, National City), and converted about 6 Lucky stores, (3 in Sacramento, Pittsburg, Vacaville, and Woodland) to the format in Northern California. Initially, American Stores named these stores Price Advantage, based on the Lucky Advantage prototype store in Escondido, California. Price Club sued American Stores over name infringement shortly before the grand openings. The stores were swiftly rebranded Food Advantage the night before Grand Openings, with the word \\"Price\\" marked out with a thick ink marker on every label, tag and sign in the store. A scaled down warehouse store, Food Advantage featured no bakery or deli, with its concept modeled in a similar fashion to Food 4 Less stores. In the coming months, American Stores would rebrand these stores as Food/Price Advantage. Finally, American Stores decided to rebrand them as Super Saver, bringing back the familiar logo that had been used decades earlier in Philadelphia. In 1999, Albertsons purchased American Stores. A number of the Super Saver stores were divested to satisfy anti-trust concerns, but a few remained. By 2003, the only remaining Super Saver stores still operated by Albertsons were in Indio (closed in 2005), Woodland (closed in 2006) and Gonzales, LA (closed in 2006). =Albertsons version= In 2003, Albertsons then announced that they would be developing a new Hispanic format in Southern California, and would be calling it Super Saver. A few Albertsons stores converted to Super Saver, as well as a Max Foods location near the Mexico border in San Ysidro. In 2004, Albertsons announced that they were creating a discount grocery store division that would operate initially in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. This division would be an independent operating subsidiary of Albertsons known as EXTREME, Inc. These stores would be converted poorly performing former Albertsons stores and the name used on the store would be Super Saver. At this time, the Super Saver logo was redesigned. Albertsons also rebranded two former Food 4 Less stores in Utah to Super Saver at this time, but continued to use other names for discount format stores in Colorado and parts of California (Max Foods and Grocery Warehouse). The Super Saver stores offered Acme products for private label goods rather than the Albertsons brand, much as the original Acme Super Saver chain sold the company's Alpha Beta products instead of the Acme Ideal brand of the time. In 2006, Albertsons was dissolved as a company. The EXTREME group was sold to Cerberus Capital Management, which became known as Albertsons LLC. That same year, Cerberus made a decision to close the entire Super Saver store chain on August 1, except for a couple of stores in Utah.More Albertsons Closings Announced, Morning News Beat, June 14, 2006 The stores in Utah are now known as Lucky.

There was previously also a botanical collection but this was transferred to the National Botanic Gardens in 1970. As with many other natural history museums, the majority of specimens are not on display, for example the geological collections. In 1962, a building known as the \\"Annexe\\", which housed the main geological displays was demolished to make way for the D√°il √âireann restaurant and office, leading to these collections being placed in storage in buildings in Beggars Bush and elsewhere since.

Stuffed and mounted mammals, birds, fish ‚Äî and insects and other animals native to or found in Ireland ‚Äî comprise the rest of the ground floor. Many of the specimens of currently extant animals, such as badgers, hares, and foxes, are over a century old. A basking shark hangs from this ceiling. This grouping of Irish fauna in one room dates from 1910, when the collections were arranged by geography rather than purely taxonomy. The first floor contains mammals from around the world, including extinct or endangered species, including in turn a thylacine, and a pygmy hippopotamus. Also on display is the polar bear shot by Admiral Sir Francis Leopold McClintock. Many of the mounted specimens were purchased from or donated by the Royal Zoological Gardens, Dublin. Part of the large collection of Irish birds bequeathed by Richard Barrington is mounted along one wall. The Lower gallery, closed to general access since 2007, contains bird specimens from around the world. Above this, the second ceiling suspends a humpback whale and fin whale skeleton. This floor includes a composite dodo skeleton, from Mauritius. The Upper gallery, also closed since 2007, displays invertebrate and marine specimens including the Museum's collection of Glass Sea Creatures made by the glass artists Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka (the makers of Harvard's famous Glass Flowers collection). Numerous game heads can be seen mounted on pillars from the first floors up to the upper gallery, many of which were presented to the museum in the 1930s. History =1786‚Äì1857= The current museum was built in 1856 to house the Royal Dublin Society's growing collections, which had expanded continually since the late 18th century. In 1792 the Society purchased the collection of Nathaniel Gottfried Leske under the instruction of Richard Kirwan. Leske's collection was one of Europe's largest natural history collections. From this core collection, the Professor of Mineralogy in the RDS, Karl Ludwig Giesecke, expanded the collection by travelling Ireland and internationally including Greenland. The museum in Leinster House opened to the public two days a week from 1832, having been previously the private museum of the members of the RDS. Foreseeing that the museum may become a national museum, in 1836 a special Parliamentary Committee found that the public should have greater access to the museum, which would require a larger building. By 1850, with visitor numbers reaching 44,000 there were complaints of the cramped conditions during those restrictive public visiting hours of two days a year, nine months out of twelve. Alexander Carte was appointed curator and then Director of the Natural History Museum, and oversaw a period of expansion of the collections, with the aim of making the museum be more representative of geological and zoological diversity both nationally and internationally. Carte also began organising the exhibitions and collections into those pertaining to Ireland and then international specimens. He reorganised the insect collections, documenting the damage and loss of specimens that had occurred in the Leskean collection. As part of his strategy to encourage more donations, Carte published lists of the acquisitions and donors in the new Journal of the Royal Dublin Society. =1857‚Äì1877= In 1853 Society began plans for the new museum building by applying for a grant from the Treasury, partly in compensation for the building the RDS had handed over to Board of Trade which was to become the New School of Design. A grant of ¬£5000 was granted, with ¬£2500 to be raised by public subscription. This resulted in the building which still houses the Natural History Museum today. It was originally built as an extension to Leinster House, where the Royal Dublin Society was based from 1815 until 1922. The building was designed by architect Frederick Clarendon in harmony with the National Gallery of Ireland on the other side of Leinster Lawn. The frame of the building is cast iron, largely clad internally with timber on the upper floors. The exterior uses dressed granite and Portland stone. The foundation stone was laid on 15 March 1856 by Earl Carlisle the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and the building was completed in 1857 by contractors Gilbert Cockburn & Son. It was connected to Leinster House by a curved closed Corinthian colonnade, which once held displays of the Geological Survey of Ireland. The connection of the buildings allowed a visitor to move from Leinster House to the Museum building, and was eventually connected with the purpose built museum on Kildare Street. The new museum building was opened in August 1857. The first event was a Conversazione on 27 August attended by 1500 including Earl Carlisle. On 31 August David Livingstone delivered a lecture in the museum. The first exhibitions were mounted on the first floor and consisted of plants from the Botanic Gardens, Kiltorcan fossils, some birds donated by Carte, edible crustaceans and molluscs, Irish lepidoptera collected by Rev Greene, and fossils and birds collected by McClintock in the Arctic regions. There was also a selection of scientific instruments on display, along with some of the Society's library books. The ground floor hosted an area for refreshments for the attendees of the lectures. While Dublin awaited the building of a National Gallery, the Natural History Museum hosted an exhibition of Decorative Art from Easter Monday 1858 which was opened by Earl of Eglinton. The exhibition was viewed by 55,000 over 11 weeks. Due to Carte's efforts in soliciting donations, the collections expanded considerably in the 1860s, but the Society only spent ¬£373 on purchasing specimens. In the early 1860s much of the collection was not on display due to a lack of funds to prepare them for exhibition, and owing to the fact the ground floor of the new museum building was not completed, lacking heating and a permanent floor surface. Samuel Haughton arranged part of the mineralogical collection for display. In 1864, the RDS held an Exhibition of Manufactures in a purpose built building. Known as the Shelbourne Hall, it became an annexe of the museum housing the fossil hall and staff facilities. By 1867 the museum was open 4 days a week, and undertook to open for one evening every week. Due to the success of the evening opening it then remained open for two evenings each week. At this time the idea of Sunday openings was suggested, but did not happen until 1884. In 1870 the museum was visited by 103,237 members of the public. =1877‚Äì1919= From 1868 to 1876 the Government began to look at creating a policy for science and art in Ireland. It was proposed that relevant institutions should be founded and built, such as a Science and Art Museum, a National Gallery, a National Library, a School of Art, and museums dedicated to Natural History and Irish Antiquities, all on one site. On 18 November 1876 the RDS received a letter from the Secretary to the Treasury, William H. Smith, stating that there was an intention to obtain an Act of Parliament which would ‚Äúvest all the buildings and land now held by the Royal Dublin Society in the Government‚Äù to allow ‚Äúthe State the requisite control over property and buildings upon which a large amount of public money is to be expended.‚Äù The Society was amenable to this, and relevant compensation was decided upon. On 14 August 1877 ownership of the Museum and its collections was transferred to the State by an act of parliament, under the directorship of William Edward Steele and was known as the Museum of Science and Art, Dublin. New funding was provided for a new museum building on Kildare Street, and the collections were expanded to include representative specimens from British expeditions and surveys, various marine stations, British and European biological suppliers and taxidermists. As the new Irish museum was deemed to be on a par with other British institutions, seeing surplus collections and exchanges between the institutions. Specimens of note that were presented to the museum in 1877 was a Giant Irish deer from the Marquess of Bath, and what became recognised as the type of Rhomaleosaurus cramptoni. Carte died in 1881, and was succeeded by A.G. More with the amended title of Curator rather than Director. Under More's direction, the museum focused on the overhauling of the collections and exhibitions, through cleaning, re-labelling, and reorganisation. In particular the displays were set out in a new taxonomic order. More retired in 1887 due to ill-health, which resulted in Robert Francis Scharff becoming the new Curator in March 1887. In 1890, the purpose built museum for Irish Antiquities, saw the collections of Art and Industry, as well as the herbarium and economic collections moved into this building. Owing to the museum's reorganisation, the title of Curator was changed to Keeper. The 1890s saw the first female members of staff with Matilda Knowles and Jane Stephens appointed as Technical Assistants. A bronze statue of Surgeon-Major Thomas Heazle Parke was commissioned in the 1890s which still stands at front of the building. Electrical light was introduced to museum building in 1882, but it was only in 1895 that it was deemed satisfactory enough to fully replace the gas lighting. During this time many of the staff members added to the collections, such as Valentine Ball, Richard J. Ussher, and Alfred Cort Haddon. Specimens were also purchased from suppliers such as Robert Damon, Edward Gerrard & Sons, Deyrolle, V√°clav Friƒç, Wilhelm Schl√ºter, Rowland Ward and Williams & Son, Dublin. From 1905 to 1911, Scharff and other members of staff took part in surveys with the RIA of islands off of Ireland such as Lambay and Clare Islands. The staff were also involved in cave explorations, the materials from which were deposited in the museum. From 1885 to 1920, the museum produced catalogues of its collections by taxa as well as more general guides to the collections across the various divisions. More specialised lists were also written by museum staff. Scharff oversaw further expansion of the collections, particularly for areas of fauna that had been previously poorly represented, with the aim that the collections would reflect the full diversity of fauna in Ireland in particular. In 1909 a new entrance was constructed at the east end of the building facing Merrion Street, partly due to the construction of the College of Science which now houses the Department of the Taoiseach. This reversed the direction from which visitors approached the exhibitions and explains why some of the large exhibits still face what appears today to be the back of the building. =1920‚Äìpresent= In 1920 the RDS vacated Leinster House for their new premises in Ballsbridge, allowing Leinster House to become to seat of the new Irish Free State government. The colonnade which connected the museum to Leinster House was closed off in 1922. During this period the museum itself closed to the public from 28 June 1922, owing to the loss of Leinster House and the consequential reorganisation, but also due to the changeover of staff from the British civil service to the newly formed Irish service. The museum was reopened on 2 June 1924, with a significantly reduced staff. This also resulted in little change to the exhibitions for a long period of time. From 1921 the museum officially became known as the National Museum of Ireland. In 1927 the Minister for Education set up a Committee of Enquiry to report on purpose of the National Museum and how it could be improved. The report was written by Professor Nils Lithberg, in which he noted the cramped and poor conditions in which the zoological collections were held, and that the Natural History Museum was in a precarious condition. During a period in the 1950s, owing to loss of staff to retirement and resignation, the museum had just one staff member: Geraldine Roche. The geology and palaeontology collections received more curatorial attention and the addition of numerous new specimens during the 1950s and 60s under the auspices of John S. Jackson. Collections were removed from the annexe building, and placed into storage in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s as the staff increased again modestly, the entomology and zoology collections received more attention, both in the exhibitions and in the stored collections. =Stairway collapse= On the morning of 5 July 2007, the 150-year-old Portland stone staircase (not accessible by the general public) partially collapsed. Eleven people were injured, as a teacher training course was underway in the area. The stairway was a very ornate structure, arising from Leinster House's former status as the home of the Royal Dublin Society. Members of same would have used what is now the back door of the museum building to gain access from Leinster House to this building, hence the grandeur of the stairway. The building was subsequently the subject of a Health and Safety review, and following this, plans for improvements were made, which have been partially implemented. This building was closed until Thursday 29 April 2010, when the ground and first floor were reopened. The two galleries remain closed due to lack of emergency exits at upper levels. =Plans - 2000s= In the 2000s plans for an extension to one side of the existing building were considered, to provide more display space, and enable construction of lifts. This plan was costed at 15 million euro. Other previous reports have also cited the under-staffing of the museum, along with the restraints of the 1857 building as hampering the development of the exhibitions and collections. An even more ambitious plan, for a new building within the Collins Barracks complex to house a number of exhibition spaces including an earth science gallery, and costed at about 70 million euro. All such plans were put aside after the economic collapse of 2008. =Plans - 2018‚Äì2021= The museum is included in the 2018-announced National Development Plan, with allocation for the construction of a glass-and-steel structure to one side, with modern display space, not interfering with the integrity of the historic building, an education space, a shop, a caf√©, and lifts and other disabled-access facilitation; it might also facilitate the needed emergency egress points from the galleries. Professional functions Including the Keeper, there is a professional staff of just 3‚Äì4 in recent years, much smaller than in many comparable institutions, handling management, curation, classification, international cooperation and scientific advice. In particular, the museum forms part of the global scientific community handling taxonomic queries and exchanging materials and reference data. Hiring limitations in recent years have seen key posts go unfilled, sometimes being partly delivered by retired staff returning pro bono part-time, notably the former entomologist (a key role given that half the collection is of insect samples). Governance and operations The National Museum of Ireland has a unified organization structure and budget, with a single overall Director, a Keeper for each major collection, including Natural History, and to some extent also location, and shared registration, education, IT and administrative functions. Also shared is the facilities function, which provides the attendants for the galleries. Staffing has been severely restricted for many years, and at the Natural History Museum these limitations led to there being no educational operation for at least two years, and to the closure of the museum shop for some years; it resumed operations, selling books and other science-related items at the end of March 2018. Use as a venue The first wedding ceremony to take place in the Natural History Museum Dublin The museum has been used as a filming location, particularly for Victorian period dramas. These include an episode of Ripper Street season 2 in 2013. In 2015 Penny Dreadful filmed in the museum for season 3, seeing the museum standing in for the Natural History Museum, London. In 2018, the museum also became a wedding venue. It held its first wedding in January 2018 between former staff member Rebecca O'Neill and her fianc√©e Greg Sheaf.

The company is based in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota. History The company was established as the \\"Toro Motor Company\\" in 1914 to build tractor engines for The Bull Tractor Company, In 1948, Toro enters the push mower market acquiring Whirlwind Corp. They sold push mowers under this name for several years. They would close the Whirlwind Co. Windowm Mn. factory in 1952. In 1970, Toro's Chairman, David Lilly, and President, Al Conover, determined Toro's need to become a full-line lawn and garden manufacturer. To accomplish this, they recognized the need to offer a serious two-stage snow thrower line. However, persons who previously tried to accomplish this with less than stellar results, pronounced, \\"We are a mower company and don't belong in snow.\\" Nevertheless, Conover and Lilly assigned a couple newly employed engineers, to lead a group in research of alternatives for a potential new line of snow throwers. One of them then conducted the full line product development, resulting in a 3-unit line that received top ranking with Consumer Reports in its second year. Thus, Toro began its long-term domination of the snow industry. Later on, an unusual snow thrower concept, prototyped and demonstrated as part of this same research program, was developed further and became Toro's \\"Power Curve.\\" These same two individuals went on to create a number of other original Toro concepts, including Toro's \\"kicker\\" based mulching mower system, its riding mower bagging system, its yard lights, its \\"virtual pivot\\" fairway mower attachment system, its leaf vacuum/blower system, and a number of other concepts to facilitate Toro's campaign to become a full-line lawn and garden manufacturer. In later years, and as independent consultants, these same people went on to create and develop these multiple new patentable concepts for Toro, plus multiple other Minnesota companies. Thanks to excellent follow up and further improvement by Toro‚Äôs in-house product development engineering staff, plus very smart marketing efforts and decisions, Toro established its position as a genuine leader in the outdoor consumer product market. In 1986 Toro acquired the Wheel Horse Products Division of American Motors Corporation (AMC). Wheel Horse manufactured a wide range of lawn and garden tractors as well as riding lawn mowers. The division was spun off from AMC for $8 million so that the automaker could maintain focus on vehicles. The benefits to Toro were its knowledge about the outdoor power products sector and buying Wheel Horse put Toro back into the riding mower business. Lawn and garden tractors were then marketed under the Toro, Wheel Horse, and Toro Wheel Horse names. Acquisitions continued with the purchase of Lawn-Boy in 1989 from Outboard Marine Corporation. In the 1990s, then CEO Kendrick Melrose changed the company's strategy, shifting its focus to \\"professional maintenance markets\\" (such as golf courses, sports fields, municipal parks, and commercial properties). The company grew by acquiring James Hardie Irrigation in 1996, Exmark Manufacturing in 1997, Hayter in 2005, Rain Master Irrigation Systems, and Turf Guard Wireless Monitoring Technology in 2007. The strategy yielded higher margins and offered more protection from the uncertainty of weather and economic conditions than the highly competitive residential market segments. During December 2001, Toro adopted new accounting rules the Emerging Issues Task Force had issued and restated the prior periods. The adoption of these rules had no effect on operating earnings or net income. In 2007 almost 70 percent of the company's sales came from professional markets, versus one- third in 1990. In 2007, the low-end lawn and garden tractor product manufacturing was outsourced to MTD Products, to be sold at Home Depot stores. Toro also discontinued its Wheel Horse models and retired the brand name in 2007. However, products and other brands expanded with Toro's purchases of TYCROP Manufacturing turf equipment product line in 2009 and USPraxis in 2010. In 2014, the snowplow and snow removal equipment company Boss Products was purchased by Toro. On February 15, 2019, Toro announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire privately held The Charles Machine Works, the parent company of Ditch Witch and MTI Equipment and other brands, for $700 million.

Among other achievements, Dubourg led the orchestra at the premiere of Georg Friedrich Handel's great oratorio Messiah.  Biography  Dubourg was born in London, the illegitimate son of a court dancing master, his mother's identity is unknown.David J. Rhodes: \\"Dubourg, Matthew, in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. by Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 332. In 1712, at age 9, he performed a Corelli sonata standing on a stool at the home of Thomas Britton. At age 11, in 1714, he furthered his studies under the celebrated Italian violinist, composer and music theorist Francesco Geminiani. He performed a sonata at the Queen's Theatre in March 1714, a benefit concert in May at Hickford's Room, as well as many other performances during the London season.Dictionary of National Biography On 17 June 1727 he married Frances, the daughter of musician Bernard Gates at Stanmore, Middlesex.. They had one child, a daughter named Elizabeth, who married oboist Redmond Simpson on 22 September 1753, who had one child.. Dubourg served as concert-master from 1728 to 1764 in Dublin. His official title was \\"Chief Composer and Master of the Music attending His Majesty's State in Ireland\\" at Dublin Castle. He was a major force the musical life of Dublin, together with Geminiani, who was his friend and teacher for many years. Handel's Messiah Dubourg led the orchestra in the first performances of Handel's Messiah. Dubourg had worked with Handel as early as 1719 in London. The premiere of Messiah took place at \\"Mr Neale's Music Hall\\" in Dublin on 13 April 1742. Permission to use members of the choirs from Dublin's cathedrals had been granted by the dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift (1667‚Äì1745) (who is better known today as the author of Gulliver's Travels). However, Swift then withdrew his permission, only to grant it once again as the dates for the performances drew near. Swift also had no kind words for Dubourg's orchestra. He called them \\"a club of fiddlers in Fishamble Street\\". Handel led the performance of Messiah from the harpsichord, and Dubourg conducted the orchestra. Despite Swift's sally against Dubourg's orchestra, Handel thought they played quite well, writing to Charles Jennens, \\"as for the Instruments they are really excellent, Mr. Dubourgh being at the Head of them, and the Musick sounds delightfully in this charming Room\\". Of a concert in 1742 conducted by Handel, the following anecdote was told: Dubourg played a cadenza in which he wandered far from the theme creating complex modulations of it. When he finally returned to the original theme, Handel said: \\"Welcome home, Monsieur Dubourg\\". Following the premiere of Messiah Dubourg travelled to London with Handel and performed several other works with him at Covent Garden, including Samson, L'Allegro ed il Penseroso, and the London premiere of the Messiah in 1743. He returned to Dublin in October. Works Dubourg wrote several works, which are still frequently played, particularly in Britain. One of his passions was to take famous Irish tunes and morph them in the late Baroque style as, for example, with his Variations of Druid Tunes. His variations of the sonatas (op. 5) of Arcangelo Corelli are also often heard. Later life and death In 1752, Dubourg became Master of the Royal Chapel in London, a post he occupied until his death in 1767.. On 3 July 1767 Dubourg made a brief will leaving most of his estate to his wife Frances, and he died shortly thereafter. There is some question on the date of death, but his registered date of death is 5 July 1767. The inscription on his tombstone reads: \\"Here lyeth the body of Matthew Dubourg, chief composer and master of music in the kingdom of Ireland, servant to four generations of the illustrious House of Hanover, George I. and II., his Royal Highness the late Prince of Wales, and His present Majesty; as also instructor in Music to their Royal Highnesses the Duke of Cumberland and the late Prince Frederick.

Accessed September 16, 2007. College career Brunner played under head coach Tubby Raymond and led the Delaware Fighting Blue Hens to the NCAA Division II Football Championship in his only year as a starter in 1979. Brunner earned first team All-American honors by the American Football Coaches Association and was the Eastern College Athletic Conference All-East Player of the Year in 1979 when he threw for 2,401 yards and a then school record 24 touchdowns in leading Delaware to a 13-1 record and a national title game win over Youngstown State University. He also served as a backup in 1978 (behind future NFL player Jeff Komlo) and helped UD advance to the NCAA Division II championship game. Brunner was selected to the NCAA Division II Hall of Fame in 2002. Professional career Brunner was selected by the New York Giants in the sixth round of the 1980 NFL Draft. He replaced an injured Phil Simms during the 1981 season as the starting quarterback for the Giants. With Brunner leading them, the Giants beat the Philadelphia Eagles 20‚Äì10, but subsequently lost to the San Francisco 49ers 17‚Äì10. The Giants defeated the Los Angeles Rams 10‚Äì7 and the St. Louis Cardinals 20‚Äì10, setting up a season finale against the Dallas Cowboys, in which a win would clinch their first playoff berth since 1963. The Giants won the game 13-10 in overtime. The Giants were unable to build on their success in 1982, mainly due to the 1982 NFL Players strike that reduced the schedule to nine games. Ray Perkins left the Giants after the 1982 season and George Young's choice to replace Perkins was Bill Parcells, the Giants' defensive coordinator. Brunner was named the starter for the 1983 season opener against the Rams. Parcells chose Brunner over Simms, Jeff Rutledge and Mark Reed. Brunner was traded to the Denver Broncos on April 27, 1984, in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick (used to select linebacker Gary Reasons) to serve as backup quarterback to John Elway. Brunner was placed on injured reserve with a knee infection, however, on August 29, 1984. He was traded to the Green Bay Packers on April 26, 1985, in exchange for a 1986 sixth round draft pick (used to select tight end Orson Mobley), but was again traded, this time to the Cardinals on August 26, 1985, for another 1986 sixth round pick (used to select linebacker Burnell Dent). After backing up Neil Lomax in 1985, Brunner was released by the Cardinals on August 27, 1986. In his NFL career, he played in 72 games and threw for 29 touchdowns. He rushed for one touchdown and passed for 6,457 yards.

He was a war correspondent during World War I and co-authored the official history of Australia's involvement in the war. He later served in federal parliament from 1925 to 1940 and held senior ministerial office. Gullett grew up in country Victoria. He left school at the age of 12 but began a career in journalism through family connections. During World War I he was attached to Australian units on the Western Front and the Sinai and Palestine campaign, and also did work for the War Records Section. He contributed a volume to the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914‚Äì1918. Gullett was elected to parliament in 1925 as an \\"independent Nationalist\\". He joined S. M. Bruce's government as Minister for Trade and Customs (1928‚Äì1929) and then became deputy opposition leader (1929‚Äì1931) after the government's defeat. Gullett held a series of senior portfolios in the United Australia Party (UAP) governments of the 1930s, serving as Minister for Trade and Customs (1931‚Äì1933), External Affairs (1939‚Äì1940), Information (1939‚Äì1940), and Scientific and Industrial Research (1940). He was killed in the 1940 Canberra air disaster, along with two cabinet colleagues and the head of the army. Early life Gullett was born on 26 March 1878 in Toolamba West or Harston, Victoria. He was the son of Rose Mary () and Charles William Gullett; his father was born in London and his mother in Victoria. He grew up on his father's farm, a half-cleared selection of , learning \\"milking, ploughing, harvesting and horsemanship even as he received his schooling\\". He left school at the age of 12 following his father's death. Journalism, literary work and public service Gullett was encouraged to pursue a career in journalism by his uncle Henry Gullett, who wrote for the Daily Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald. He began his career writing on agriculture for the Geelong Advertiser, then in 1900 his uncle invited him to move to Sydney and join the staff of the Herald. In 1908, Gullett moved to England and became a London correspondent for the Daily Telegraph and The Sun, as well as working as a freelancer. He developed an interest in British immigration to Australia, writing pamphlets and giving lectures for the Australian High Commission. In 1914, he published The Opportunity in Australia, a semi-autobiographical tract designed as \\"an illustrated, practical handbook on Australian rural life\\". =World War I= After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Gullett received accreditation with the British and French militaries as an official war correspondent. He covered the Western Front, where he was \\"seeing war at close quarters but was not happy to be a mere observer\\". He briefly served as an ambulance driver, but declined a commission in the Grenadier Guards to return to Australia and enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Gullett was recruited as a speaker in enlistment campaigns and for the \\"Yes\\" vote in the 1916 Australian conscription referendum. He enlisted as a gunner in the 2nd Division's ammunition column, arriving in England in early 1917, but his age and a bout of pleurisy rendered him unfit for frontline service. Instead, his friend Charles Bean asked him to assist with his archival work. In August 1917 he was commissioned as a temporary lieutenant in the Audit Section of AIF headquarters in France. After seven weeks he was sent to the Australian War Records Section in London, and then in November, at Bean's request, attached to the AIF headquarters in Cairo. For the remainder of the war, Gullett was attached to various Australian units in the Sinai and Palestine campaign, including the Desert Mounted Corps, No. 1 Squadron AFC, the Imperial Camel Corps, and the Australian Light Horse brigades. He was appointed officer-in- charge of the local branch of the War Records Section in May 1918, then from August was an assistant official correspondent with the AIF. His \\"status as historian in uniform enabled him to move freely among all ranks\\", and he developed friendships with Banjo Patterson, Ross Smith and Richard Williams. He was made a Commander of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1918 for his war-time service. =Post-war career= Undated photo Gullett was present at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference as a press liaison officer to Prime Minister Billy Hughes. In the same year he co-edited Australia in Palestine, a history of Australia's involvement in the Palestine campaign, and published a pamphlet titled Unguarded Australia in favour of the \\"populate or perish\\" attitude towards immigration. In 1923, Gullett's contribution to the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914‚Äì1918 was published, a volume of nearly 800 pages covering the AIF in Sinai and Palestine. According to it was \\"comparable in scope, if not quite in authority, with the works of Bean on the more popular themes of the Western Front and Gallipoli\\". Bean himself regarded as \\"the most readable and most read\\" of the official history's twelve volumes. In 1919, despite his dislike of Hughes, Gullett accepted the prime minister's invitation to become the inaugural director of the proposed Australian War Museum, working out of the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne. He resigned the following year to become the director of the Australian Immigration Bureau, but his tenure there was short as he fell out with Hughes over immigration policy. After his resignation he was offered a position on The Times in London, but declined as he preferred to stay in Australia. He instead remained in Melbourne as the news editor of The Herald. Political career =Early years= Gullett with S. M. Bruce, who gave him his first ministerial appoinmtent Gullett began contemplating a political career towards the end of the war. Letters to his wife record his alignment with the Australian Labor Party (ALP), but concerns that \\"Labour people at home will be hard to swallow\\" and that \\"it will be hard to take sides against many good friends in the AIF who are uncompromising\\". In November 1918, he wrote: > I should give a fortune to be out on the Labour ticket next elections in > Australia. With a good propagandist on their side they will sweep H & Co > into the sea. The present administration is a hopeless thing & is not > improving. Gullett's eventual entry into politics came at the 1922 election, where he and his friend John Latham stood as anti-Hughes \\"Liberal\\" candidates. His initial attempt to win the Division of Henty was unsuccessful, but he reprised his candidacy at the 1925 election as an \\"independent Nationalist\\" and was elected. He allied himself with backbenchers holding similar views and in 1927 attracted attention by referring to Earle Page as \\"the most tragic Treasurer Australia had ever had\\". However, as with Latham, Hughes' successor as prime minister S. M. Bruce secured Gullett's support by inviting him into the ministry. He was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs in November 1928, following the 1928 election, but held office for less than a year before the government's defeat. Bruce lost his seat at the 1929 election and Latham was elected as the new leader of the Nationalists; Gullett became his deputy. Jack Lang remembered him as \\"the gad-fly who harassed the Scullin Government incessantly\\". He was involved in the formation of the United Australia Party (UAP) in 1931, which saw former ALP minister Joseph Lyons succeed Latham as leader of the opposition. Latham in turn became deputy leader of the new party, succeeding Gullett as deputy opposition leader. =Lyons Government= Undated photo (Dickinson-Monteath Studio) Gullett was re-appointed Minister for Trade and Customs when the Lyons Government took office in January 1932. He lobbied Lyons against including the Country Party in the ministry, predicting \\"they will prove filthy foes and will stab you all the way from the corner\\". Later in 1932, Gullett and Stanley Bruce represented Australia at the British Empire Economic Conference in Ottawa, which attempted to establish Imperial Preference, a system of tariff concession within the British Empire. He suffered from poor health on his return and resigned from the ministry in January 1933. In the same month he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George for his work at the Ottawa Conference. In October 1934, Gullett was re-appointed to the ministry as a minister without portfolio with responsibility for trade treaties. In early 1935, he presented a draft trade treaty with Japan to cabinet. He travelled to England with his wife later that year to attend the Silver Jubilee of King George V, and to discuss trade with representatives of Britain and the other Dominions. In 1936, Gullett continued his work on the proposed trade deal with Japan, which was tentatively titled the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. However, negotiations broke down and a trade war commenced, with Australia increasing duties on Japanese clothing and artworks and Japan doing likewise on Australian agricultural products. Jay Pierrepont Moffat, the U.S. Consul in Sydney, observed in his diaries that Gullett \\"looked ill and tired\\" and was \\"constantly leaving his desk and taking some medicine at a cupboard in the corner\\". His health forced a second retirement from the ministry in March 1937. However, Moffat believed that his resignation was actually due to a disagreement on trade policy. =Menzies Government= Gullett towards the end of his life In April 1939, Gullett became Minister for External Affairs in the first Menzies Ministry and Minister for Information from September 1939. However, when Robert Menzies formed a coalition with the Country Party in March 1940, he was moved to Vice-President of the Executive Council, and Minister in charge of Scientific and Industrial Research. He was killed in the Canberra air disaster in August 1940. Personal life On 2 October 1912, Gullett married Elizabeth Penelope \\"Penny\\" Frater, the daughter of the Australian writer Barbara Baynton. The couple had two children together. Their son Jo Gullett also entered politics, serving as the member for Henty from 1946 to 1955. Their daughter, Susan, was the mother of the actress Penne Hackforth-Jones.

Synopsis Alone on the astroship, Laureline departs the planet Rubanis, in the Constellation of Cassiopeia, having obtained the information she requires for the spatio-temporal agent's latest mission. Rendezvousing with the Apominobas merchants, they tell her of swindlers who are selling dangerous technologies. Leaving the Apominobas, she continues to her destination: the planet Solum. Using a telepathic link provided by Galaxity, she communicates with Val√©rian to keep him up to date with her progress. Val√©rian is sitting in a caf√© in Paris, 20th century Earth, waiting for Galaxity's contact, Mr Albert, to arrive. Albert enters the caf√© and seats himself beside Valerian. He has news: strange things have been happening on the M√©tro ‚Äì a presence at Auber station, a sighting at Nation station and now a derailment at Ch√¢telet. Val√©rian and Albert leave the caf√© and make for the metro station. Arriving they are told that the station is closed but manage to slip down onto the platform. Val√©rian proceeds down the tunnel to where the train derailed. Remaining behind at the platform, Albert observes a group of men ‚Äì some of whom appear to be businessmen ‚Äì heading down the tunnel as well. Val√©rian sees a light ahead of him in the tunnel and is suddenly confronted by a fire-breathing dragon. Pulling a futuristic rifle from his trench coat, he opens fire on the apparition which, he realizes, is made of pure energy. There is an explosion and Val√©rian is thrown to the ground, unconscious. Waiting outside the station, Albert is concerned that Val√©rian has been away too long. The group of men he saw at the station emerge, looking displeased, get into their vehicles, which include a van marked ‚ÄúBellson & Gambler‚Äù, and drive off. Shortly afterwards, an ambulance draws up and Val√©rian is carried out of the station on a stretcher. Albert follows the ambulance to the hospital where he convinces the doctors that he is Val√©rian's uncle and manages to get him discharged, telling the gendarmes that Val√©rian is weak-minded and believes he is an intergalactic detective. Later, at dinner, they review what has happened: they cannot think of a connection between the apparition on the M√©tro, the incident that brought Val√©rian to the 20th century in the first place ‚Äì an apparition of a muddy monster at a mine in Lorraine and Laureline's investigations in Cassiopeia. As they walk back to his hotel, Val√©rian complains of headaches arising from his telepathic communications with Laureline. In his hotel room, Val√©rian contacts Laureline who has reached the planet Solum. The ground on the planet is porous and ever-changing, and its inhabitants are engaged in incessant rebuilding of their ever-sinking city, adding layer upon layer. Each layer contains a living memory who records the history of the planet and Laureline is moving deeper and deeper trying to find a history who can give them a lead on the incidents that are happening on Earth. Val√©rian is woken by the phone in his room. It is Albert, ringing to warn him that his hotel is under observation by the police and by a second, unknown, group. Val√©rian slips out of the hotel via the roof and meets Albert in a taxi at the end of the road. The taxi takes them to a railway station where they get a train to Marais Poitevin where sightings of a monster have been reported in the marshes. Sleeping on the train, Val√©rian resumes contact with Laureline. One of the histories on Solum has told her a story about a planet called Ohuru which was plagued, and eventually destroyed, by similar apparitions. The history also tells Laureline of a link between the planet Ohuru and the planet Zomuk ‚Äì the dumping ground of the universe. The inhabitants are noted for the sanctuaries that they construct from the materials deposited on their planet. Laureline is told that some artifacts from Ohuru have landed up on Zomuk and she is now heading there to investigate. Arriving at Marais Poitevin, Val√©rian and Albert try to book into a hotel but find that it has been booked out by representatives, from United States, of a multinational company called W.A.A.M. who have gone on an excursion into the marshes. Following them into the marshes, Albert muses on the two corporations ‚Äì Bellson & Gambler and now W.A.A.M. who appear to be mixed up in this affair. Albert believes the second car that was watching Val√©rian's hotel was from Bellson & Gambler. They meet a farm-boy, Jean-Ren√©, in the marsh who tells them that the men from W.A.A.M. are looking in the wrong place. He offers to take Val√©rian to where the monster is but only if Val√©rian will give him his rifle and allow him to make the first shot at the beast. Val√©rian, reluctantly, agrees and they set off into the marsh. The monster, which resembles a whale, appears but Jean-Ren√©'s shot just bounces off its hide. Jean-Ren√© is knocked out by the recoil from the gun but Val√©rian grabs the rifle and opens fire, killing the monster. Returning to Paris, Albert brings Val√©rian to his house where one of his carrier pigeons has arrived with a message from Chatelard, an old friend of Albert's and a philosopher of science and mythology. Driving to Chatelard's house, Val√©rian and Albert are greeted by the old man who tells them that he believes there will be one more manifestation and it will take the form of air. He explains that there appears to be a link between the apparitions and the four classical elements ‚Äì the mud monster in the mine was earth, the dragon in the M√©tro was fire and the creature in the marsh was water. Chatelard also tells Albert that this is not the first time he has been asked about these manifestations ‚Äì a young woman from an American research centre had previously offered him a lot of money for any information he could share. As Val√©rian and Albert leave Chatelard's house, they are observed by a young, blonde woman in a car. Back at Albert's house, Albert looks up Bellson & Gambler and W.A.A.M. in his files. Bellson & Gambler are a heavy industry corporation, involved in mining, steel and petroleum. W.A.A.M. - World American Advanced Machines ‚Äì are a new economy company involved in electronics and computers. Albert realizes that these two disparate organisations are competing with one another to gain control of the powers behind the manifestations. Meanwhile, on Zomuk, Laureline has resumed contact with Val√©rian. The most beautiful sanctuary on Zomuk has been plundered of its contents. Gaining entry to the sanctuary, Laureline finds its main chamber empty except for representations of the four elemental forces on the walls ‚Äì exactly what Chatelard spoke of. Suddenly, the link between Val√©rian and Laureline is broken by an interruption from Albert. Angry at being cut off, Val√©rian snaps at Albert and storms out of the house. Val√©rian mopes angrily through the streets of Paris when a sports car, driven by the young woman who was watching him and Albert at Chatelard's house, pulls up. She asks Val√©rian if he'd like to go dancing with him. Val√©rian gets in the car and they drive off. Continues in Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos...

He was born in San Francisco, a place he recounts in his childhood memoir/novel China Boy (1991) about growing up in a broken, poverty-stricken immigrant family in an inner city ghetto. Lee attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, did graduate study in East Asian History with Liu Kwangching and obtained a J.D. (law) degree from the University of California, Davis School of Law (King Hall). While a graduate and law student at Davis, Lee served as an Assistant Dean of Students for the Educational Opportunity Program, project coordinator for Asian American Studies and ROTC Brigade Commander. He was an Army boxer, Army drill sergeant, paratrooper, Command Judge Advocate, U.S. Senate ethics investigator and legal adviser to the worldwide Connelly Investigation with tours in Asia. He became a multiple-event whistle blower, which involuntarily launched him into his work as an ethicist and character-based leadership consultant. Lee worked as supervising deputy district attorney, acting deputy attorney general, FBI and law enforcement trainer, Deputy Director of the California District Attorneys Association. He was an adjunct leadership instructor at USC. Lee recounts his life in autobiographical fiction. A challenging childhood in San Francisco's Panhandle is the subject of his book China Boy (1991), which became San Francisco's first One City One Book selection and a Colorado Springs' Pikes Peak Reads selection. Honor and Duty (1994) describes the tension between integrity, friendship and fidelity in an autobiographical tale about West Point. Tiger's Tail (1996) recounts Lee's role as an Army criminal investigator pursuing enemy secret agents, man-carried atomic devices and shaman prophets on the Korean DMZ. No Physical Evidence (2000) is a legal thriller that recounts a difficult trial as a deputy DA, involving a vulnerable teenage victim and a sociopathic child abuser, and recounts the simultaneous loss of their first daughter. Lee followed with a memoir, Chasing Hepburn (2004), in which his mother and three young sisters conduct a harrowing flight from wartime China to America. His 2007 book Courage: The Backbone of Leadership describes the measurable behaviors of integrity and courage. He has contributed to anthologies, written for Time and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and written op-eds. The death of his West Point mentor, General H. Norman Schwarzkopf caused him to write With Schwarzkopf: Life Lessons of the Bear (2015), which recalls their relationship.

Synopsis Val√©rian wakes up in a hotel room next to the blonde woman he met at the end of M√©tro Ch√¢telet, Direction Cassiopeia. He has been roused by Laureline using their telepathic link. She explains that Albert had become concerned at Val√©rian's disappearance some days previously and, unable to locate him, had resorted to contacting Galaxity via the space-time relay. Galaxity had then passed on the message to Laureline who used the link to contact him. Val√©rian, embarrassed, explains that he has been enjoying himself with the woman, who is called Cynthia Westerly. Laureline tells Val√©rian that Albert is certain that Cynthia is an agent of W.A.A.M. Laureline, meanwhile, has found out more about what happened on Zomuk when the four elements were stolen. A magnificent spacecraft had landed on Zomuk near the sanctuary and two figures emerged claiming to be the gods the Zoms worshiped. Believing them, the Zoms took them to the sanctuary and presented them with the four elements. Each \\"god\\" took two of the elements but their separation seemed to cause the two \\"gods\\" to fight amongst themselves. When, during the fight, one of the \\"gods\\" dropped a disintegrator rifle, the Zoms realised they were being deceived ‚Äì but too late: the spacecraft, now carrying the four elements, took off. Analyzing the disintegrator, Laureline determines that it was manufactured on one of the asteroids of the Elsinn Belt, a known hideout for space pirates. She decides to head there to see what she can find. The next morning, in Paris, while having breakfast in the hotel, Cynthia receives a call. Eavesdropping, Val√©rian learns that the next manifestation will be at Beaubourg. Returning to the table, Cynthia makes an excuse that she is meeting an aunt at the airport and can't stay with Val√©rian. When she leaves, Val√©rian telephones Albert and they agree to meet at Beaubourg. Cynthia emerges from the hotel and gets into her car observed by agents of Bellson & Gambler. They see Val√©rian follow her and pull up pretending to be a taxi. Cynthia meets her associates in the plaza in front of the Pompidou Centre while Val√©rian finds Albert. They look around the plaza trying to find the manifestation. Suddenly Albert spots an old homeless woman with a magnificent blue bird. The W.A.A.M. representatives also suspect something and offer the woman money in exchange for the bird. Val√©rian surprises Cynthia and in the confusion snatches the bird from the old woman. He dashes into the Pompidou Centre with it where the bird suddenly grows and become enveloped in a blue fire. Val√©rian opens fire with his rifle and destroys the apparition but not before it strikes him with a tongue of fire. Somewhat dazed and disoriented, he rejoins Albert in the underground car park. Taking the car to the airport, Val√©rian is bombarded with visions of alien worlds and of the future. The visions continue all throughout their flight to New York where they are greeted by another friend of Albert's, Schlomo Melsheim, one of the greatest authorities on the Kabbalah. Schlomo brings them to his home in Brooklyn where his wife tends to Val√©rian. Schlomo tells Albert that he had been approached by representatives of Bellson & Gambler seeking his assistance. The company had been contacted by an alien force via their computer promising sales demonstrations of new energy technologies unknown on Earth. At the same time, W.A.A.M. had also received a similar approach. Both companies employed experts from a myriad of disciplines including many mystical gurus such as medicine men, astrologers, alchemists, parapsychologists and ufologists. A final demonstration has been organised on some waste-ground in Brooklyn and Schlomo drives Val√©rian and Albert there. Albert disguises himself with a false beard. Many representatives of Bellson & Gambler are present including Jeremiah Bellson, the co-founder of the company himself. Schlomo has managed to gain access to the meeting though Bellson's lover, Sarah Friedlander, an old acquaintance. Sarah introduces them to Bellson with Schlomo claiming that Albert is an expert on Zohar and Val√©rian is his assistant. From Bellson's car, they observe that representatives of W.A.A.M. have also turned up for the demonstration. Val√©rian, still feeling unwell, excuses himself and tries to regain contact with Laureline. Laureline explains that she has found the two, Crocbattler and Rackalust, who stole the elements from the Zoms in the Elsinn Belt ‚Äì they are hiding out in an abandoned fortress on one of the asteroids where they have been squabbling non-stop since their successful raid. In conjunction with a criminal gang on Rubanis, and possibly manipulated by the mysterious aliens of the planet Hypsis, they conspired to steal the elements and sell them to the highest bidder on Earth. As Laureline explains the situation to Val√©rian, all four elemental forces manifest themselves in Brooklyn and begin to wreak havoc. The observers from Bellson & Gambler and W.A.A.M. look on, helpless. Laureline acts quickly ‚Äì dressed in an alluring costume she convinces Crocbattler and Rackalust to engage in a duel with the four elements and Laureline herself as the prize. Consumed with lust they agree and end up shooting and killing each other. Drawing her gun, Laureline destroys the four elements. At that moment the manifestations disappear. All the observers have fled except for Val√©rian, Albert and Schlomo. Jeremiah Bellson is the last to leave in his car accompanied by the founder of W.A.A.M. with whom he is discussing a joint venture. Val√©rian bids them farewell and makes for the Statue of Liberty where he uses the spatio-temporal relay station there to return home and face Laureline for his indiscretion.

Notes * There are two references in this album to the adventure The City of Shifting Waters -- the character of Sun Rae makes a cameo appearance in plate 31, frame 9; and Val√©rian mentions that adventure as he leaves Albert and Schlomo and returns to Galaxity via the spatio-temporal relay station located in the Statue of Liberty. * This album marks the first references to the mysterious planet of Hypsis ‚Äì first it appears as one of Val√©rian's visions of the future when he is affected by the element of Air and secondly Laureline suggests that it is the Hypsis that manipulated Crocbattler and Rackalust, as well as their contacts on Rubanis, to steal the elements and try to sell them to Earth ‚Äì foreshadowing the events of The Ghosts of Inverloch and The Rage of Hypsis. * This is the only adventure in which Val√©rian and Laureline never physically meet. * There is a certain similarity between the outfit Laureline wears to attract Crocbattler and Rackalust and the \\"Queen of Sin\\" costume Emma Peel wears in The Avengers episode \\"A Touch of Brimstone\\" * This story, involving supernatural powers drawn from representations of the four elements, bears some similarities to the 1997 Luc Besson film The Fifth Element on which Jean- Claude M√©zi√®res worked as a conceptual artist. While the Val√©rian series is certainly an influence on the film, it is not known to what extent the plot was influenced by this album and M√©tro Ch√¢telet, Direction Cassiopeia. Besson claims that he first came up with the idea for the film at the age of 16 which would pre-date the publication of these albums. 1981 graphic novels Val√©rian and Laureline ","title":"Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos"},{"id":"3516549","text":"Sabina (Latin: Sabinum), also called the Sabine Hills, is a region in central Italy. It is named after Sabina, the territory of the ancient Sabines, which was once bordered by Latium to the south, Picenum to the east, ancient Umbria to the north and Etruria to the west. It was separated from Umbria by the River Nar, today's Nera, and from Etruria by the River Tiber. Today, Sabina is mainly northeast of Rome in the regions Lazio, Umbria and Abruzzo. Upper Sabina is in the province of Rieti (Poggio Mirteto, Magliano Sabina, Casperia, Montopoli di Sabina, Torri in Sabina, Cantalupo in Sabina, Montebuono, Forano, Poggio Catino, Montasola, Stimigliano, Castelnuovo di Farfa, Fara in Sabina, Roccantica, Mompeo, Salisano, Cottanello, Configni, Vacone, Tarano, Collevecchio, Toffia, Poggio Nativo, ecc.). Sabina Romana is in the province of Rome (Mentana, Monteflavio, Montelibretti, Monterotondo, Montorio Romano, Moricone, Nerola, Palombara Sabina). Part of Sabina is in the regions of Umbria (territories of Narni, Amelia, Cascia, Norcia, partially Upper Valnerina, etc.) and Abruzzo (from Valle dell'Aterno to L'Aquila). History The Sabines who lived in two of the Seven Hills of Rome (the Quirinal and Viminal) formed part of the population of Rome (together with the Latins who lived on the other hills) at the time of its foundation. The second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius, was from Cures, the capital of Sabina. During the reigns of the Roman kings Ancus Marcius and Tarquinius Priscus the Sabines attacked Roman territory several times. This also occurred during the early period of the Roman Republic. After the Third Samnite War (298-290 BC), the Romans moved to crush the Sabines. The Roman consul Manius Curius Dentatus pushed deep into Sabina in the area between the rivers Nar (today‚Äôs Nera, the main tributary of the River Tiber) and Anio (Aniene, another tributary of the Tiber) and the source of the River Avens (Velino). Spurius Carvilius confiscated large tracts of land in the plain around Reate (today‚Äôs Rieti) and Amiternum (11 km from L'Aquila), which he distributed to Roman settlers.Florus, Epitome of Roman history, 1.10 Florus did not give the reasons for this campaign. The modem historian Salmon speculates that \\"it might have been because of the part they [the Sabines] had played or failed to play in the events of 296/295 [BC].\\" Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites, p. 376 That is, they let the Samnites cross their territory to go to Etruria and join forces with the Etruscans, Umbrians and Senone Gauls. Forsythe also speculates that it may have been a punishment for this.Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome, p. 334 Livy mentioned that Dentatus subdued the rebellious Sabines.Livy, Periochae, XI The Sabines were given citizenship without the right to vote (civitas sine suffragio), which meant that their territory was effectively annexed to the Roman Republic. Reate and Amiternum were given full Roman citizenship (civitas optimo iure) in 268 BC. In the Augustan division of Italy, Sabina was included in the region IV Samnium. With Diocletian's late 3rd-century administrative reforms, Italy became a Roman diocese and was subdivided into Roman provinces. Sabina became part of the province of Samnium. Constantine the Great turned Italy into a praetorian prefecture and subdivided it into two dioceses. Sabina fell under the diocese of Italia suburbicaria as the province of Valeria. With the Lombard invasion of Italy in the Early Middle Ages, the territory of Sabina became part of the Lombard Duchy of Spoleto. With the Byzantine reconquest of central Italy, it came under the Duchy of Rome of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna. With the rise of the Papal States, Sabina was governed directly by the pontificate or indirectly, by the counts of Sabina, a title of the noble Crescentii family in the 10th and 11th centuries. During the late 9th to early 10th century, the region was, along with much of central Italy, a stronghold of, or threatened by the Saracens.

Suburbicarian bishopric :See also suburbicarian diocese. Sabina has been the seat of a Catholic bishopric since the 6th century, though the earliest names in the list of bishops may be apocryphal. The official papal province of Sabina was established under Pope Paul V in 1605. The Cardinal Bishop of Sabina is one of the six suburbican tituli (not counting Ostia) of the College of Cardinals which carry the rank of Cardinal Bishop.

One of the oldest churches in the city‚Äîalong with St. Peter's Church and St. Rupert's Church‚Äîit is one of the few surviving examples of Gothic architecture in Vienna. Located in the Innere Stadt at Salvatorgasse 12, near the Donaukanal, the church was traditionally used by sailors on the Danube river. The name reflects the former location on the Fluvial terrace of an arm of the Danube river, prior to its regulation. Due to the stairs surrounding the church it got the popular name Maria Stiegen. History It is said that there was a wooden church at this place in the 9th century, although this has been disputed, Felix Czeike: Wien. Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte der Donaumetropole. Dumont, 1999. . which served as a place of worship for fishermen and sailors. The church is first mentioned in documents from 1158. The present building was built between 1394 and 1414 in gothic style. The first reference occurs in 1137, indirectly, and more explicitly in 1200. The ownership of the land appears obscure, variously passing into the hands of the Diocese of Passau in Bavaria, the nearby Schottenstift, and Viennese families. From 1302, the church was owned by the Herren von Greif. Between 1330 and 1355 a new choir was constructed and was probably conceived as a family burial ground. In 1409, the church became a more permanent part of the Passau diocese, giving its name to the surrounding precinct (Passauer Platz) and remained an enclave when the Archdiocese of Vienna was established in 1469. The church was deconsecrated in 1786 and gradually became dilapidated and parts were torn down. It was used as an arsenal and stable during Napoleon's occupation of Vienna in 1809. In 1812, the church was renovated and newly consecrated, coming into the hands of the Redemptorist order. The Gothic choir windows were taken to Laxenburg in Lower Austria and installed in Franzensburg castle. The church was further restored in 1900 and again in 1930, mainly involving the figures in the portico. The church is associated with the Czech community in Vienna.  Description  = Tower = The church's most striking characteristic is the 56 m (180 ft) high open work tower, built in 1419-1428 in Gothic scrollwork. It is recognisable from a great distance and is depicted on the oldest images of the city. = Choir = The choir, whose construction was begun at the same time as the tower around 1330 contains two high gothic panels (1460). The windows contain surviving fragments of medi√¶val stained glass. = Nave = The nave which, due to the limited space, is narrower than the choir. Because of the then course of the Danube arm the nave is slightly bent. Construction was started in 1400, and it is said that Duke Albrecht III himself was the builder. The builder of the choir and the tower was Michael Knab, who also produced the (later modified) plan for the towers of St. Stephen's cathedral, and was succeeded by Peter Prachatitz, also a master builder. = Porticos = The church has three porticos that are decorated with reliefs and figures. The choir door shows a Virgin of Mercy and a Coronation of the Virgin, both dating from around 1350, as deduced from during the Middle Portal which has realistic depictions of angels playing musical instruments. On the main portal on the west facade, canopies crown reliefs of the two Saint Johns (Baptist and Evangelist) from about 1410, in a style also seen at Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral and a range of sculptures and mosaic decoration, which date from the 20th century. = Art and ornamentation = An Annunciation in the nave of the church dates from about 1360 and is attributed to the Meister der Minoritenwerkstatt whose work also appears in Vienna's Minoritenkirche. The Virgin's partial disengagement from the wall and the spatial independence of the gestures are considered to make this an important transitional piece of the High Gothic. The pulpit is a Gothic Revival structure installed in 1820 during the renovation of the church which aimed to restore its medieval appearance. Elisabeth Hassmann: Meister Michael: Baumeister der Herzoge von √ñsterreich, B√∂hlau Verlag, 2002, p. 242 The wooden structure was affixed on the huge medieval pillar between the nave and the choir with a bridge connecting it to the door that was cut in the northern wall. The colour scheme is olive and gold, with blind tracery decoration on the balustrade and the rear wall. The abat-voix is crowned with the statue of Christ as Salvator Mundi under a pinnacled baldachin. The previous pulpit was erected in 1727 on the same spot in Baroque style.Carl Friedrich von Wiebeking: Theoretisch- practische b√ºrgerliche Baukunde, M√ºnchen, 1823, 2. vol., p. 98 Gallery =Exterior= File:Maria am Gestado Vienna August 2006 001.jpgMaria am Gestade File:Maria am Gestade.jpgMaria am Gestade File:MariaG01.jpgMaria am Gestade File:Maria am Gestade Wien 2010 Westportal 3.jpgWest portal File:MZK 002 Baugeschichte Maria am Gestade in Wien Fig. 01 Grundriss.jpgFloor plan of church =Interior= Wien - Maria am Gestade, innen.JPGInterior Maria am Gestade Wien 2014.jpgInterior Maria am Gestade Wien 2014 3.jpgAltar Wien - Maria am Gestade, Hochaltar.JPGAltar Wien Maria am Gestade Orgel.jpgPipe organ by Matth√§us Mauracher Jr. Gestade pulpit.jpgThe pulpit References ;Citations ;Bibliography   Smith DJD.

He played as a midfielder from 1985 until 2004, starting in non-league football. Signed by Nottingham Forest in 1990, he played for the club for 10 years, including a spell in the Premier League. After leaving the club he played for a number of sides, both in England and in the United States, before retiring in 2005. He is the son of Alan Woan who also played professionally, most notably for Northampton Town, Crystal Palace and Aldershot. Playing career =Early career= Born in Heswall, Cheshire, Woan started his career in 1985 at Manchester City but never made a start for the then First Division club. He spent five years playing in the lower leagues, including spells at Heswall, Welsh sides Caernarfon Town and Newtown, and Runcorn. His big break came, aged 22, when on 14 March 1990 he joined first division side Nottingham Forest for a fee of ¬£80,000. =Nottingham Forest= Woan did not make an appearance for the Midlanders in the latter half of the 1989‚Äì90 season, his debut coming almost ten months after joining the club. He made his first appearance on 2 January 1991 as a substitute in a 6‚Äì2 victory over Norwich City and went on to make 12 appearances that season, scoring three league goals. He started the 1991 FA Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur, and was taken off after 63 minutes for Steve Hodge. Forest went on to lose the match in extra time. On 20 April 1992, Woan scored the first goal in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford, as United's title challenge imploded in the run-in of the last season of the old First Division. Praised for his languid left foot, attacking flair, crossing and shooting ability, but questioned over his lack of pace, Woan established himself as one of the most prominent figures in the Forest team. Forest finished in third place in the 1994‚Äì95 season, booking a UEFA Cup place for the following year. In the fifth round of the 1995‚Äì96 FA Cup, Woan scored two long-range free-kicks, the second from an acute angle, to secure a 2‚Äì2 draw with Tottenham. Woan later said \\"I knew I wouldn't stand a chance [of taking the free kicks] had Stuart [Pearce] not been injured. I've tried that [the second free-kick] a hundred times and it always ends up in the Trent!\\" Forest went on to win the replay at White Hart Lane 3‚Äì1 on penalties after a 1‚Äì1 draw, with Woan converting his spot kick. Forest made it to the quarter- finals of both the FA Cup and UEFA Cup in 1995‚Äì96 but finished 9th in the league and failed to qualify for Europe. In the penultimate game of the season, Forest faced Newcastle United, who were still hoping to secure their first Premier League title. In an echo of his late intervention in 1992, Woan scored a long distance effort and the game finished 1‚Äì1. The title subsequently went to Manchester United. Following manager Frank Clark's departure in December 1996, Woan's Forest career began to suffer although the winger was the only player to play for the Reds in each year of the 1990s. During his ten-year spell at the club, Woan made 189 league appearances ‚Äì as well as 32 substitute appearance ‚Äì delivering 31 goals during his time. =Later playing career= Upon leaving Forest in 2000, and after a short trial with Bolton Wanderers, Woan signed for Swindon Town and in the 2000/01 season, producing three goals from 25 appearances. A year later Woan found himself joining American team Columbus Crew. Married to an American wife, the then 33-year-old winger endured a difficult season in Major League Soccer with the team winning just two of their eight opening matches. This led to the replacing of manager Tom Fitzgerald, the man who had secured Woan's contract in America. At the end of the season, Woan was traded to the Miami Fusion and finished his MLS career with them. In 2002, Woan returned to England and signed for struggling Shrewsbury Town, who were at the bottom of the Third Division. Woan teamed up with ex-Forest striker Nigel Jemson and the pair notably inspired the Shrews to one of their greatest ever results. The Shropshire outfit defeated Everton ‚Äì who featured a young Wayne Rooney ‚Äì in January 2003 in the third round of the FA Cup, with Jemson scoring twice. It was Woan's last minute cross that ensured the Premier League side's fate, but the Shrews were knocked out of the competition 4‚Äì0 by Chelsea the next round in a televised match. Shrewsbury were relegated that season and Woan returned to America. Woan then joined the Syracuse Salty Dogs of the A-League (the U.S. second tier) and competed in another season in the States before deciding to return to England. Coaching career Woan headed back to Swindon Town, taking charge of the under 18 side at the County Ground until deciding to move to Rushden & Diamonds as first team coach for Paul Hart in July 2006. Following the sacking of Hart later on in 2006, Woan then returned to Nottingham Forest, charged with coaching some of the youngsters coming through the Forest Academy. In March 2007 he was signed for Hucknall Town by one-time teammate Andy Legg, but didn't play in any games. On 7 July 2007, Premier League outfit Portsmouth announced that Woan had joined as coach of their Under-18s.

It consists of two concentric curtain walls and about nine towers of which three are preserved to their full medieval height, including the original battlements, and is said to be the only entirely preserved medieval castle in the country. Baba Vida is above sea level.Baba Vida Altitude and Location The construction of the fortress began in the 10th century at the place of the Ancient Roman castell Bononia. The building of Baba Vida is tied to a legend, according to which a Danubian Bulgarian king who ruled at Vidin had three daughters: Vida, Kula and Gamza. Prior to his death, he divided his realm among the three. Vida, the eldest, was given Vidin and the lands north to the Carpathians, Kula was awarded Zajeƒçar and the Timok Valley, and Gamza was to rule the lands west up to the Morava. Although Gamza and Kula married to drunkard and warlike nobles, Vida remained unmarried and built the fortress in her city. The name of the castle means \\"Granny Vida\\". Baba Vida served as Vidin's main defensive installation during the course of the Middle Ages and acted as the most important fortress of northwestern Bulgaria. The Baba Vida stronghold withstood an eight-month-long siege by Byzantine forces led by Basil II, but was destroyed and once again erected during the rule of Ivan Stratsimir (1356-1396), as whose capital it served. Between 1365 and 1369, the fortress was in Hungarian hands. Vidin was suddenly attacked by the forces of Louis I of Hungary, but it took several months to conquer Baba Vida. In 1369, Ivan Sratsimir managed to regain control of his capital, albeit having to remain under Hungarian overlordship. In 1388, the Ottomans invaded Sratsimir's lands and forced him to become their vassal. In 1396, he joined an anti-Ottoman crusade led by the King of Hungary, Sigismund, placing his resources at the crusaders' disposal. The crusade ended in the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis at Nikopol, Bulgaria, with the Ottomans capturing most of Sratsimir's domains shortly thereafter, in 1397. The fortress played a role during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, serving as a weapon warehouse and a prison, also as residence for Osman Pazvantoƒülu, as it has been no longer used for defensive purposes since the end of the 18th century. Today, Baba Vida castle functions as a museum. Being a popular tourist attraction, the fortress is being kept in repair.

Along with Saga of Erik the Red, it is one of the two main literary sources of information for the Norse exploration of North America. It relates the colonization of Greenland by Erik the Red and his followers. It then describes several expeditions further west led by Erik's children and √ûorfinnr \\"Karlsefni\\" √û√≥r√∞arson. The saga is preserved in the late 14th Century Flateyjarb√≥k manuscript and is believed to have been first written sometime in the 13th centuryThe Sagas of Icelanders (Penguin Books. √ñrn√≥lfur Thorsson, ed. 2001, p. 626.) regarding events between around 970 to 1030. Parts of the saga are fanciful, but much is believed to be based on historical truth. Synopsis =Colonization of GreenlandThe first chapter is taken from Landn√°mab√≥k and is probably not originally a part of the saga. It is often omitted from editions and translations.= An interpretation of the sailing routes to Greenland, Vinland, Helluland and Markland travelled by different characters in the Icelandic Sagas, mainly Saga of Eric the Red and Saga of the Greenlanders. Erik the Red emigrated from Norway to Iceland with his father, Thorvald Asvaldsson, to avoid murder charges. Erik married Thjodhild in Iceland. He again is involved in a dispute and is proclaimed an outlaw. He resolves to find the land spotted by Gunnbjorn while lost during a western voyage. Erik departed Iceland near Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull and arrived at the glacial coast of Greenland where he then sailed south searching for habitable areas. After two years of exploring, he returned to Iceland and told of his discoveries and giving Greenland its name as a way to attract settlers. Over- wintering in Iceland, Erik set sail again intending to colonize Greenland. His expedition has 30 ships but only 14 reach their destination. Erik founded a colony at Brattahlid in the south-west of the island where he became a respected leader. Erik and Thjodhild had three sons Leif, Thorvald, and Thorstein and a daughter Freydis.According to Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a, Freydis was an illegitimate child but this is not mentioned in Gr≈ìnlendinga saga. =Bjarni's voyage= A man named Bjarni Herjolfsson has the custom of spending alternate winters in Norway and in Iceland with his father. When he arrives one summer in Iceland he finds that his father has emigrated to Greenland. He resolves to follow him there though he realizes that it is a dangerous proposition since neither he nor any of his crew has been in Greenland waters. After sailing for three days from Iceland, Bjarni receives unfavorable weather, north winds and fog and loses his bearing. After several days of bad weather the sun shines again and Bjarni reaches a wooded land. Realizing that it isn't Greenland, Bjarni decides not to go ashore and sets sail away. Bjarni finds two more lands but neither of them matches the descriptions he had heard of Greenland so he does not go ashore despite the curiosity of his sailors. Eventually the ship does reach Greenland and Bjarni settles in Herjolfsnes. The description of Bjarni's voyage is unique to Greenland saga. Bjarni is not mentioned at all in Eir√≠ks saga rau√∞a which gives Leif the credit for the discoveries. =Leif's expedition= Das Haus des Glockenspiels in Bremen's B√∂ttcherstra√üe displays this Leif and Karlsefni panel of 10 from Bernhard Hoetger's 1934 \\"ocean-crossing\\" set Leif Eriksson becomes interested in Bjarni's discoveries and buys a ship from him. He hires a crew of 35 people and asks Erik to lead an expedition to the west. Erik is reluctant and says he is too old but is eventually persuaded. As he rides to the ship, his horse stumbles and Erik falls to the ground and hurts his foot. Considering this an ill omen, he says: \\"It is not ordained that I should discover more countries than that which we now inhabit.\\" Leif, instead, leads the expedition. Setting sail from Brattahlid, Leif and his crew find the same lands Bjarni had discovered earlier but in the reverse order. First they come upon an icy land. They step ashore and find it to be of little interest. Leif names the country Helluland meaning Stone-slab land. They sail further and find a forested land with white shores. Leif names it Markland meaning Wood land and again sets sail. Now Leif sails for two days with a north-easterly wind and comes upon a new land which appears very inviting. They decide to stay there for the winter. > The nature of the country was, as they thought, so good that cattle would > not require house feeding in winter, for there came no frost in winter, and > little did the grass wither there. Day and night were more equal than in > Greenland or Iceland. > ‚Äî Beamish (1864), p.64 As Leif and his crew explore the land, they discover grapes. There has been much speculation on the grapes of Vinland. It seems unlikely that the Norsemen travelled far enough south to find wild grapes in large quantities. On the other hand, even Adam of Bremen, writing in the 11th century, speaks of grapes in Vinland so that if the grape idea is a fantasy it is a very early one. The Norsemen were probably unfamiliar with grapes -- at one point the saga speaks of \\"chopping vines\\" -- and it is possible that they mistook another type of fruit, perhaps gooseberry, for grapes and Leif names the country Vinland. In the spring the expedition sets sail back to Greenland with a ship loaded with wood and grapes. In the voyage home they come upon and rescue a group of ship- wrecked Norsemen. After this Leif is called Leif the Lucky. =Thorvald's expedition= Leif's voyage is discussed extensively in Brattahlid. Thorvald, Leif's brother, thinks that Vinland was not explored enough. Leif offers him his ship for a new voyage there and he accepts. Setting sail with a crew of 30, Thorvald arrives in Vinland where Leif had previously made camp. They stay there for the winter and survive by fishing. In the spring Thorvald goes exploring and sails to the west. They find no signs of human habitation except for one corn-shed. They return to their camp for the winter. The next summer Thorvald explores to the east and north of their camp. At one point the explorers disembark in a pleasant forested area. :[Thorvald] then said: \\"Here it is beautiful, and here would I like to raise my dwelling.\\" Then went they to the ship, and saw upon the sands within the promontory three elevations, and went thither, and saw there three skin boats (canoes), and three men under each. Then divided they their people, and caught them all, except one, who got away with his boat. They killed the other eight, and then went back to the cape, and looked round them, and saw some heights inside of the firth, and supposed that these were dwellings. ‚Äî Beamish (1864), p.71 The natives, called Skraelings by the Norsemen, return with a larger force and attack Thorvald and his men. The Skraelings fire missiles at them for a while and then retreat. Thorvald receives a fatal wound and is buried in Vinland. His crew returns to Greenland. =Thorstein= Thorstein Eriksson resolves to go to Vinland for the body of his brother. The same ship is prepared yet again and Thorstein sets sail with a crew of 25 and his wife Gudrid. The expedition never reaches Vinland and after sailing the whole summer, the ship ends up back at the coast of Greenland. During the winter, Thorstein falls ill and dies but speaks out of his dead body and tells the fortune of his wife Gudrid. He predicts that Gudrid will marry an Icelander and have a long line of \\"promising, bright and fine, sweet and well-scented\\" descendants. Thorstein also predicts that she will leave Greenland for Norway and from there she will set out for Iceland. She will, however, live so long that she outlives her husband. Once her husband passes, Thorstein foresaw, she would travel abroad once again, going south on a pilgrimage and then return to her farm in Iceland. When she returns, a church will be built. From the time it is built until she dies, she will remain there and take holy orders. =Karlsefni's expedition= A ship arrives in Greenland from Norway commanded by Thorfinn Karlsefni, a man of means. He stays with Leif Erikkson for the winter and falls in love with Gudrid. They marry later that same winter. Karlsefni is encouraged by his wife and other people to lead an expedition to Vinland. He agrees to go and hires a crew of 60 men and 5 women. The expedition arrives in Leif's and Thorvald's old camp and stays there for the winter in good conditions. The next summer a group of Skraelings come visiting, carrying skins for trade. The Skraelings want weapons in return but Karlsefni forbids his men to trade weapons. Instead he offers the Skraelings dairy products and the trade is successful. Near the beginning of their second winter the Skraelings come again to trade. This time one of Karlsefni's men kills a Skraeling as he reaches for Norse weapons. The Skraelings run off. Karlsefni fears the natives will return, hostile and in larger numbers. He forms a plan for the coming battle. The Skraelings do come again and the Norsemen manage to fight them off. Karlsefni stays there for the remainder of the winter and returns to Greenland next spring. During their stay in Vinland, Karlsefni and Gudrid had the son Snorri. =Freydis's expedition= Freydis, daughter of Erik, proposed a voyage with the brothers Helgi and Finnbogi to travel to Vinland together and share the profits fifty- fifty. After the brothers agreed to the proposal, Freydis turned to her brother Leif because she wished to have the housing he built in Vinland. Leif said she may borrow them, but she could not have them for herself. The agreement between Freydis and Helgi and Finnbogi was that each could have no more than 30 men on board and then women as well. This agreement was made to ensure that neither side had an unfair advantage against the other, but Freydis quickly double crossed her partners and brought along 5 extra men. Upon arrival at Vinland, the brothers arrived slightly earlier and unloaded their belongings into Leif's house. When Freydis realized what they had done she immediately made them remove their things and so the brothers built their own longhouse. After a winter of small disputes, Freydis arose early one morning to go speak with the brothers. Finnbogi was the only one awake and he stepped out to hear what Freydis had to say. Finnbogi explained his dislike for the ill feelings between their two parties and hoped to clear the air with Freydis. She agreed and offered a trade. The brothers wanted to stay in Vinland, but Freydis was ready to go back home; she suggested they trade ships since the brothers had a much larger one than she did and it would be of better use bringing back her people and her half of the profits. Finnbogi agreed to this and the two parted. Once Freydis returned home, her cold, wet feet awoke her husband, Thorvard. He asks where she has been and she spins a tale much different from the actual events that took place. She says she offered to buy the brother's ship but they became angry and struck her. Freydis then continued to manipulate her husband till he agreed to avenge her. If he hadn't she threatened divorce. Thorvard took his men and began tying up all the men from the other camp in a sneak attack while they were still sleeping. Freydis had each man killed on the spot if they belonged to Finnbogi and Helgi's crew. Soon only the 5 women were left alive, but no man would dare kill them. In response Freydis says, \\"Hand me an axe.\\" She made quick work of slaying the women and she became very pleased with how well her morning had gone. She told all involved that anyone who speaks a word of the events would be killed. The plan was to say that the brothers chose to stay behind in Vinland while Freydis returned to Greenland. Once back home, Freydis returned to the farm and was sure that her crew was well rewarded for the trip to Vinland in order to keep them quiet about her dastardly deeds. Eventually though, Leif caught wind of what had happened and he was furious. He predicted, \\"that their descendants will not get on well in this world.\\"Kunz, Keneva, trans. \\"The Saga of the Greenlanders.\\" The Sagas of Icelanders: A Selection.

He later settled in Iceland with his wife and son and their descendants included some of the earliest Icelandic bishops.

Synopsis Inverloch Castle, Northern Scotland, 1986: Laureline, a guest at the castle, goes on her morning ride across Kenchmoor with her host, Lady Seal. Laureline is anxious: she has been at the castle for some days and has received no further details of what her mission here is. The planet Glapum't: Valerian has been hunting one of the native Glapum'tiens for some time but with little success. Finally, using some drugged food he captures his prey. Securing his prize on board the astroship and preparing for a spatio-temporal jump, he is concerned that he is unable to get a signal from Galaxity. London, England, 1986: Mr Albert, Galaxity's contact on 20th century Earth, checks out of his hotel room and makes his way on foot to King's Cross where he just makes it in time to catch the train to Scotland. He is carrying important confidential papers for a meeting. The planet Rubanis: Colonel Tloc, the chief of police meets with three Shingouz. He rebuffs their various offers of information until they deliver some shocking news to him ‚Äì a scanograph that shows that he is infected with the deadly Scunindar virus. They offer him the location of a possible cure in return for details of the threat faced by Earth. Tloc tells them that the threat comes from the planet Hypsis. He gives them the present location of their planet, a mysterious place that regularly changes its location. West Virginia, USA, 1986: Lord Seal meets in secret with several representatives of the United States Intelligence Community. The agencies are concerned because a large number of high level members of the defence community have suffered severe mental breakdowns including a general who blew up his missile silos and a submarine commander who sank his own ship. The situation is so bad that the country's ability to defend itself using its nuclear capability is under threat. Intelligence information suggests that something similar is occurring in the USSR. Lord Seal informs them that this matches information that he has been given by the UK Intelligence Services. The only connection that exists between all the victims were affected by strange devices disguised as cheap ornaments such as a model Pershing missile and a Snoopy toy. One of the attendees at the meeting, Gene Rowlands, falls ill during the conversation. A search of his things reveals a cheap calculator that when switched on emits a strange light. The meeting ends and Lord Seal indicates that he has every thing he needs for this evening's meeting. He is driven to a military airport and flies away in a jet fighter. Galaxity, capital of the Terran Galactic Empire, the 28th century: the Chief of the Spatio-Temporal Service sits alone in his office. All around him, the buildings of the city are disappearing into a strange mist. There are no other people to be seen anywhere. The Chief walks to a spatio-temporal relay and steps inside. Back at Inverloch Castle, Laureline and Lady Seal are watching the sun set over the castle lawn when a small spacecraft makes a crash landing onto the grass. Stepping out to investigate, the ship opens to reveal the three Shingouz. As Laureline leads them into the castle the ship's auto- destruct mechanism activates and destroys the ship. Shortly afterwards, a jet fighter overflies the castle and one of its occupants, Lord Seal, parachutes from the plane onto the castle lawn. Before joining the others in the castle, Lord Seal checks that the gardeners have cleared the greenhouse as per his instructions. Night has now fallen and with it a dense mist. Lord Seal's Rolls arrives carrying Mr Albert. Now the only person left to arrive is Val√©rian who has gotten lost in the fog. Receiving directions from some gentlemen in a local pub, he reaches the castle and parks the astroship in the greenhouse where the gardeners camouflage it under tarpaulin and palm trees. With all parties having now arrived at the castle, Lady Seal calls the group to attention. She reveals that the castle is haunted and that she has received notification that the Ghost of Inverloch will be arriving to join them this evening. They are interrupted by the Glapumt'ien, who wishes to be called Ralph, who had been forgotten by Val√©rian. Leading her guests to a ruined wing of the castle, she explains that the ghost has appeared many times to members of her family over the centuries and is responsible for the good fortune that has followed them through the generations. Reaching a deserted room among the ruins, Val√©rian and Laureline are astonished to discover a spatio-temporal relay. They are further shocked when the relay activates and the ‚ÄúGhost of Inverloch‚Äù reveals himself to be the Chief of the Spatio-Temporal Service. The Chief tells them that he has brought them together to investigate the catastrophe of 1986, first seen in The City of Shifting Waters, in which a nuclear accident at the North Pole caused the polar icecaps to melt engulfing most of the civilized world under water. He warns them that if they fail to succeed, then Galaxity will disappear and they will all be reduced to mere ghosts. Continues in The Rage of Hypsis...

She served during the Second World War and was sunk with heavy loss of life by German torpedo boats in an action in the English Channel in October 1943. Design and construction Charybdis was intended to fulfill a primarily anti-aircraft role and was designed with a primary armament of ten QF 5.25 inch guns. This gun had also been selected as the secondary armament for the battleships also under construction at this time. Delays in the delivery of the turrets, prioritised for the battleships after the outbreak of the Second World War, resulted in several of the Dido class being fitted with different primary armament. Charybdis and another Dido-class cruiser, , were armed with four twin QF 4.5 in Mk.III guns instead of the 5.25 inch guns. These 4.5 inch guns had originally been intended for the s as part of an upgrade programme. Scylla and Charybdiss armament put them on a par with the destroyers for surface action, but with much superior high angle capability. Charybdis differed from Scylla in having a single QF 4 inch Mk V gun mounted. Her armament changed during her time in service, with the 4 inch Mk V gun removed in an early 1943 refit and ten 20 mm guns added. As originally fitted, Charybdis also had eight QF 2 pounder guns arranged in two quadruple mountings, and six 21 inch torpedo tubes arranged above water in two triple banks. Like the other ships of the class, Charybdis was named after a character in Greek mythology. Charybdis is the name of a sea monster, usually mentioned alongside Scylla, the name given to another Dido-class ship, in the idiom \\"between Scylla and Charybdis\\". She was laid down at the yards of Cammell Laird at Birkenhead on 9 November 1939, and launched on 17 September 1940. After fitting out and undergoing trials, she was completed for service on 3 December 1941. Service =Home waters and Mediterranean= After trials Charybdis joined the Home Fleet and in December 1941 escorted the 1st Minelaying Squadron during Operation SN81, the laying of mines in the Northern Barrage. She remained with the Home Fleet into 1942, and in March was adopted by the civil community of Birkenhead, Cheshire, where she had been built, after a Warship Week savings campaign. On 30 March Charybdis sailed as an escort for another minelaying operation, SN87. In April 1942 she was assigned to join Force H at Gibraltar, and sailed for there as an escort for the aircraft carrier and battlecruiser . Charybdis joined Force W at Gibraltar and escorted Wasp into the Mediterranean to deliver aircraft to Malta as part of Operation Calendar. After the aircraft had been successfully flown off, Charybdis returned to Gibraltar with Wasp, and escorted her part of the way into the Atlantic. Deployed for the next few months with Force W, Charybdis escorted a number of aircraft carriers on journeys into the Mediterranean to a point where their aircraft could be flown off to reinforce Malta. As one of the escorting ships, Charybdis screened Wasp and the British carrier for Operation Bowery in early May, and Eagle and at the end of the month in Operation LB. Aircraft carrier operations continued into June 1942, with Charybdis supporting Operation Style and then Operation Salient. On 11 June Force W, including Charybdis, joined the carriers Eagle and Argus, with further escort provided by the battleship , the cruisers and and a number of destroyers to screen Operation Harpoon. The convoy in Operation Harpoon was run in conjunction with a convoy from Egypt, Operation Vigorous, both of which tried to supply food and mat√©riel by splitting enemy forces. In July 1942 Charybdis covered Operations Pinpoint and Insect, two more carrier deliveries of aircraft to Malta. By August 1942 Charybdis joined Force Z to provide an escort for HMS Eagle in the Malta convoy Operation Pedestal. =Operation Pedestal= Operation Pedestal: 12 August 1942: on fire after being bombed. HMS Charybdis is screening the carrier. Operation Pedestal was built around a 15-ship convoy of merchantmen, escorted by a powerful force consisting of two battleships, four aircraft carriers, seven cruisers and twenty six destroyers. The convoy came under heavy air and U-boat attack, sustaining high losses. HMS Eagle was sunk by torpedoes from German submarine , and only five merchant ships, including the damaged tanker , survived to reach Malta. After Eagles sinking, Charybdis launched a series of depth charge attacks in an unsuccessful hunt for U-73. She then stood by the damaged carrier and provided anti-air defence while salvage operations were carried out. On 13 July the taskforce's commander, Admiral Edward Neville Syfret, sent her to join Force X, in company with and , as the merchants came under heavy air attack while passing through the Strait of Sicily. Charybdis took the place of the crippled for this, before returning to Force Z on 14 July and continuing to engage enemy aircraft. =Atlantic and return to the Mediterranean= The focus of Charybdiss operations changed in September 1942, and she was assigned to patrol in the Atlantic, searching for German blockade runners attempting to reach Atlantic ports from the Far East. At the end of October she took part in Operation Train, escorting the carrier with further aircraft reinforcements for Malta. On 25 November 1942 she was allocated to the 12th Cruiser Squadron in Force H and sailed from Gibraltar for Algiers to take part in Operation Torch - the landings in Morocco and Algeria. She escorted the invasion convoys and provided bombardment support for the land forces, as well as anti-air defence. On 12 December 1942 Charybdis sailed for the United Kingdom to undergo a refit. Charybdis joined the Home Fleet after the completion of the work and trials in March 1943. Initially based at Scapa Flow, she covered minelaying operations and patrolled the North Sea until April 1943, when she was transferred temporarily to the Plymouth Command. There she was assigned to escort allied convoys and patrol in the Bay of Biscay. Charybdis was again back in Gibraltar in August 1943 and from there escorted Mediterranean convoys. In September Charybdis was part of Force V covering Operation Avalanche, the landings at Salerno. During her time off the Italian coast she carried US General Dwight D. Eisenhower to Salerno. She returned to Plymouth the following month, supposedly for a short period of leave. However, operational requirements directed that, almost immediately, the leave was cut short, and she resumed work in the Bay of Biscay. Operation Tunnel and sinking In late 1943, the British authorities were aware of the approach of the German blockade runner, M√ºnsterland, which was carrying an important cargo of latex and strategic metals. The Germans had a well-rehearsed procedure for escorting such vessels. The British reacted by executing Operation Tunnel, a standard operation whereby available ships would attempt to intercept. Of the planning of this operation Lt-Cmdr Roger Hill voiced his reservations to senior staff, but his advice was not heeded.[15] Charybdis was assigned to the operation on 20 October, and on 22 October the British force put to sea. With Charybdis were the fleet destroyers and , and four s: , , and . M√ºnsterlands escorts consisted of five Type 39 torpedo boats of the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, commanded by Franz Kohlauf. Charybdis picked up the convoy on its radar at 7 miles distance, but did not intercept radio transmissions, HMS Limbourne heard radio transmissions but could not pick up the ships on radar as Charybdis was blocking its view. At 1:38am German torpedo boat T23, under the command of Friedrich-Karl Paul, spotted Charybdis, which was hit on the port side by two torpedoes out of a salvo of six fired by T23 and T27. Limbourne was also hit during this action and was later scuttled by HMS Rocket. The German force escaped unharmed. Charybdis sank within half an hour, in position , with the loss of over 400 men including her captain George Voelcker. Four officers and 103 ratings survived. M√ºnsterland was eventually forced ashore and destroyed west of Cap Blanc-Nez on 21 January 1944 by fire from British coastal artillery after she ran aground. Legacy and commemoration Saint Saviour, Jersey Charybdis gained six battle honours during her service: Malta Convoys 1942, North Africa 1942, Salerno 1943, Atlantic 1943, English Channel 1943 and Biscay 1943. Soon after the sinking, the bodies of 21 Royal Navy and Royal Marine men were washed up in Guernsey. The German occupation authorities buried them with full military honours. The funerals became an opportunity for some of the islanders to demonstrate their loyalty to Britain and their opposition to the Nazi occupiers: around 5,000 islanders attended the funeral, laying some 900 wreaths ‚Äì enough of a demonstration against the Nazi occupation for subsequent military funerals to be closed to civilians by the German occupiers. Every year a commemoration service is held, which is attended by survivors of the action and their relatives, the Guernsey Association of Royal Navy and Royal Marines, Sea Cadets, St John's Ambulance Brigade, the Police, the Red Cross and representatives of the Royal Navy. Other members of the crew are buried in Jersey at St Helier (38), and in France at Dinard (96), St Brieuc (47), Ile de Brehat (1), St Germain sur Ay (1) and St Charles de Percey (2). The wrecks of Charybdis and Limbourne have been located. Charybdis was found in 1993, lying in 83 metres of water. Notes a. Some sources use this date for the commissioning as well, though naval-history.net instead records she was commissioned on 15 November 1941, following a publication by the Charybdis/Limbourne Association. b. The precise number of casualties is difficult to determine, several figures appearing in sources. Uboat.net states 464 men were lost. Naval-history.net in one place has 426 men, while the Charybdis/Limbourne Association concludes the \\"over 500 Men of Charybdis perished on that night\\". Wartime casualty lists day by day on naval- history.net records the names of 462 men from Charybdis either \\"killed\\" or \\"missing presumed killed\\", the site also stating on another page that Charybdis sank with the \\"loss of 30 officers 432 ratings\\".

Synopsis Inverloch Castle, the morning after the events of The Ghosts of Inverloch. Meeting for breakfast, Val√©rian, Laureline, the Chief, Lord and Lady Seal, the Shingouz, Ralph and Albert consider their next move. Lord Seal reports that worldwide nuclear defence systems continue to be disturbed as more and more mysterious objects from Hypsis are found. Albert produces the secret documents he has carried from France to Inverloch ‚Äì knowing that the 1986 catastrophe occurred at the Arctic Circle, he has used his maritime contacts to provide a list of vessels that may have been involved. The Chief reveals that the devices of Hypsis have also done their work on Galaxity. Lord Seal reveals that a vessel is due to meet them at Kenchmoor Cove. Arriving at the cove, they are met by Lieutenant Commander Merrywhistle of the weather ship HMS Crosswinds. Boarding his ship they begin their voyage. Val√©rian's sleep is frequently wracked by nightmares ‚Äì images of the flood that engulfed the Earth in 1986 and of Galaxity disappearing into space-time. Looking in on the chief Val√©rian and Laureline are disturbed to see him apparently mesmerized by one of the Hypsis' devices. Meeting with Albert and Merryweather, they consider the ships that are known to be in the Arctic. Albert has narrowed the possibilities down to two cargo ships, a whaler and a schooner. Several days later and they have intercepted and ruled out the two cargo ships and the whaler. Suddenly, Ralph, who has been spending most of his spare time in the ocean, returns to the Crosswinds to report that he may have some information. Checking the pictures of the last ship that they seek ‚Äì the schooner Hvexdet ‚Äì Ralph believes that this is the ship his contacts, the orcas that live in the Arctic Ocean, have told him about. He returns, accompanied by Val√©rian, to speak to them again. The orcas tell Ralph that the ship does not seem to be human to them and that they last saw it near Baffin Bay. Some time later, the Crosswinds has come upon the Hvexdet lying idle amid a group of icebergs. Merrywhistle orders his ship to ram the Hvexdet. Just as the prow of Crosswinds is about to make contact with the hull of the Hvexdet, the Hvexdet glows with a bright, alien energy and launches from the ocean into space. This is what the Chief has been counting on ‚Äì Ralph will be able to use his advanced mathematical abilities to track the Hvexdet back to Hypsis. Distracted by the Hvexdet's unexpected maneuver, the Crosswinds strikes an iceberg and begins to sink. Merryweather orders the passengers and crew to abandon ship and they make for the lifeboats. Merryweather and his crew make contact with two rescue ships and head off to rendezvous with them but Val√©rian and the others stay out on the ocean near the sinking Crosswinds. Using his communicator, Val√©rian calls Lord Seal who, using the spatio-temporal jump, brings Val√©rian and Laureline's astroship to hover just above their lifeboat. Boarding the astroship, they take off in pursuit of the Hvexdet. The Hvexdet careers through space-time, making seemingly random jumps, pursued, thanks to Ralph's abilities, by the astroship. Val√©rian proposes that they use Ralph's abilities to their greatest extent by putting him into direct phase with the astroship itself and attempting to predict where the Hvexdet will jump to before it can make the jump itself. With Ralph plugged in they make a series of jumps all in quick succession. Just as they are about to make the final jump to Hypsis, the Chief is assailed with doubt as to whether they are doing the right thing while Val√©rian is tortured once more by visions of Galaxity disappearing. Laureline, for her part, does not come from Galaxity and, fed up with their indecision, activates the jump herself and they emerge suddenly on Hypsis. The Hvexdet is ahead of them and it crashes at the foot of an immense tower. Bringing the astroship into land, Val√©rian and Laureline make for the wreckage of the Hvexdet. Examining the ship, which appears to have been crewed by androids, they find the hold loaded with nuclear charges ‚Äì enough to cause the catastrophe that melted the icecaps in 1986. The intervention by the passengers and crew of the Crosswinds means that the catastrophe will not now take place. Exploring the nearby tower, they are stopped by two sentries who tell them that only those summoned for non payment of taxes are allowed into the tower. The Hvexdet does not belong to the tower it crashed beside. A spot of negotiation by the Shingouz eventually yields the location of the tower that sent it. Gathering up the others, the party head for the tower. Arriving at the location they were given, they are surprised to find the tower is run down and neglected. Reaching the top, they are greeted by the three Lords of Hypsis who are behind the Hvexdet and the sabotage of Earth's nuclear defence capability. They include a huge man dressed in a trilby hat and trenchcoat in the manner of a gruff detective from a film noir, his hippy son and a talking slot machine which the first man is always hitting. It dawns on Albert and Lord Seal that these strange people are in fact the Holy Trinity ‚Äì the perichoresis of God, the Son and the Holy Spirit. God explains that his family has owned the Earth since its creation and has been intervening in its development, hoping to bring it forward to a point where it can return wealth to Hypsis. Other planets are owned by the other towers. The Hypsis have returned to Earth again ‚Äì in the 20th century in the form of the devices that have sabotaged the Earth's defences and in the 28th century in the form of a small silver ball given to the Chief by one of his spatio-temporal agents. This has wiped out Galaxity. The Trinity have had to wipe out Galaxity because of the complaints they are getting from the other towers ‚Äì Galaxity's imperialist tendencies have impacted on the other worlds that send tribute back to Hypsis. At this point, Albert interrupts, stating that if they proceed with their plan to cause a cataclysm in 1986 they will only precipitate the events that led to Galaxity's foundation. He points out that history is now on a different track. Lord Seal offers to intercede and to arrange for some tribute to revert to Hypsis, an arrangement that may allow the Trinity to restore their lost prestige. The Chief asks God if he can be returned to Galaxity, even though it has gone. Val√©rian wishes to go with him, to Laureline's horror. However, the Shingouz, seeing how upset Laureline is, strike a deal with God to keep the astroship for Val√©rian and Laureline so that they can continue their adventures together. Some time later, back at Inverloch, Val√©rian ponders the Galaxity he has lost as he contemplates his astroship, before Laureline prompts him into joining her, Albert and the Seals in a quiet game of croquet.

It is rare to find in cats in the United States. Uncinaria stenocephala is the most common canine hookworm in cooler regions, such as Canada and the northern regions of the US, where it can be found primarily in foxes (40%). U. stenocephala is also one of the most common hookworms in the UK, called the northern hookworm, however it has a rather low prevalence. U. stenocephala is also considered to be zoonotic hookworms because they live in animals but can be transmitted to humans.  Life cycle  The host ingests an infective third stage larva. The larva matures to the adult in the small intestine. Eggs are laid in the small intestine and pass out with the feces. The prepatent period is about 15 to 17 days. The eggs hatch in the soil and the larvae molt twice to reach the infective third-stage. Infections worsen and amplify when dogs who are regularly kept outside are not routinely dewormed. Adult worms may live for 4 to 24 months in the small intestine. Dog and cat hookworms range in size from 10 to 20 mm by 0.4 to 0.5 mm and the eggs are 71 to 93 Œºm by 35 to 58 ¬µm. A study shown a high number of eggs per female U. stenocephala worm was measured at over 5,000 eggs. Adult parasites are most often found in their hosts' small intestine. A second type of infection occurs with transdermal larval infection into the dog's skin, usually made possible by warm weather and humidity which allows the larvae to grow in the environment. These transdermal infections are not very significant in U. stenocephala because about 2.3% ¬± 1.3% of infective larvae actually reach the small intestine to finish its life cycle.  Diagnosis  Diagnostic Stage: * Eggs are found in fecal flotation. * Eggs measure 75 um long by 45 um wide. Common Diagnostic Test * Fecal float to recover eggs. Clinical Signs: *U. stenocephala ingests plasma protein rather than whole blood, so the loss of nutrients is evident. *All hookworms suck blood, they are capable of removing 0.1mL of blood per worm, per 24-hour period. * Light infections are asymptomatic. * Infected pups may present with pale mucus membranes and anemia, ill thrift, failure to gain weight, poor hair coat, dehydration, and dark, tarry diarrhea (melena). Puppies harboring many worms will develop an acute normocytic, normochromic anemia followed by hypochromic, microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency. Without immediate intervention, these animals may die of the infection. Those that survive may continue as \\"poor doers\\" with chronic anemia. U. stenocephala is considered a zoonotic hookworm and can cause a few different diseases in humans, including Cutaneous larva migrans. Humans become infected when the larvae penetrate unprotected skin due to contaminated animal feces in the environment.  Treatment/Prevention  Effective treatment of U. stenocephala includes proper medical treatment and the proper choice of anthelmintic. It is recommended for infected animals to have their feces examined 3 weeks after treatment is complete. Febantel, Febantel/Pyrantel embonate, Fenbendazole, Ivermectin, Mebendazole, Pyrantel Pamoate Heartworm prevention products that include Ivermectin/Pyrantal/Praziquantel or Moxidectin are good at controlling U. stenocephala in dogs.

Tatts Group History The company had three divisions: Lotteries, Wagering and Gaming Solutions.Tatts Group Limited 2013 Annual Report =Lotteries= Tatts Group has a near monopoly on lotteries in Australia. Tatts Lotteries is the Lotteries Operating Unit of Tatts Group and as of September 2013 the company owned or leased: * Tatts Lottery, which operates lotteries in Victoria, Tasmania, and The Northern Territory. * Golden Casket, which exclusively operates lotteries in Queensland. * NSW Lotteries, which operates lotteries in New South Wales and The Australian Capital Territory. * SA Lotteries. which exclusively operates lotteries in South Australia. On 1 June 2016 Tatts Group created a national lottery brand called ‚Äòthe Lott‚Äô. The brand encompasses all its jurisdictional lottery brands under this single entity. Corresponding with the change in branding, online lottery purchases were moved from Tatts.com to the new official lotteries website thelott.com. =Racing and sports wagering= Tatts Group holds wagering licences under its subsidiary UBET in Queensland, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania. Most of these assets were previously owned by UniTAB before it merged with Tattersalls Limited to form the modern Tatts Group in 2007. All of the licences entitle the company to the exclusive operation of physical betting shops which offer totaliser, fixed odds and sports wagering in their respective jurisdictions. The company also operates online nationally as Ubet.com providing racing and sports wagering products. Its shops operated under several different brand names due to its string of acquisitions, including TAB, TattsBet, Unitab, and others. On 27 November 2014, Tatts Group announced that it would begin to unify all of its wagering properties under the new brand UBET in 2015. =Gaming solutions= Comprising two companies, Maxgaming and ByteCraft. Tatts Group both operates and provides services for electronic gaming machines (known in Australian slang as \\"pokies\\", shortened from \\"poker machines\\"). Maxgaming Provides monitoring solutions and value adding services to the Australian gaming machine industry. Many Australian state governments have legislated mandatory monitoring for all gaming machines they license, to protect the integrity of the industry. Under this system, Monitoring Licences are granted to independent companies who operate computer networks connected to all gaming machines within a relevant jurisdiction. All machine activity is monitored to ensure that correct prizes are paid and taxes are calculated correctly on revenue. MaxGaming holds licences for three jurisdictions: New South Wales, Queensland and The Northern Territory. Queensland is the only monitoring licence that isn't exclusive, nonetheless MaxGaming still has around an 80% market share in that state.Pages 12 and 13 of the Tatts Group Limited 2013 Annual Report ByteCraft ByteCraft is an electronics specialisation company that Tatts Group Acquired primarily to maintain gaming machines. However the company isn't limited to gaming machines as its major contract is for the maintenance of Telstra's payphone networks.Page 13 of the Tatts Group limited annual report Discontinued operations =Tatts Pokies= Tatts Pokies operated over 13,000 gaming machines in Victoria starting from 1994. However the company's licence expired on 16 August 2012 and was not renewed.Page 15 of the Tatts Group Limited 2013 Annual Report The expiration of the licence led Tatts to sue The State of Victoria for compensation under a contract government signed with them in the mid 1990s. In the contract the Victorian state government signed, Tatts Group would be entitled to compensation for the infrastructure they had to pay for to set up their Tatts Pokies operation. The government materially benefited from this infrastructure. The government argued that the contract stated that compensation would be paid if \\"licences\\" were granted to any other party from 2012, but instead they granted \\"entitlements\\" to other operators and thus alleged they didn't have to pay the compensation. On 26 June 2014, The Supreme Court of Victoria found that the \\"entitlements\\" were in effect licences under the contract government signed, and awarded Tatts Group $451,157,286 Australian Dollars plus court costs and interest. Tabcorp Holdings also sued The State of Victoria under a separate agreement it had made with government, however the Supreme court of Victoria said that their agreement clearly only referred to the specific licences of the time and thus Victorian Government owed no compensation to Tabcorp. Tabcorp has since appealed this verdict. On 8 July 2014 The State of Victoria lodged an appeal in an attempt to avoid paying Tatts Group the compensation. Tatts has stated it will defend the appeal. =Talarius PLC= Talarius PLC operates gaming machine arcades in the United Kingdom under the brands Quicksilver, Winners and Silvers. The company operates more slot machines in the United Kingdom than any other company, with 7,461 machines spread across 173 venues.Page 14 of the Tatts Group Limited 2013 Annual Report Tatts Group sold the UK slot business in 2016 to Austrian gambling equipment manufacturer Novomatic Group. History The history of Tattersall's can be traced back to George Adams in 1881. Adams moved to Australia from England at the age of 16 and worked in many positions including publican, stockbroker and baker. While working as a publican in Sydney in 1881, Adams took bets on horse races, which could be considered the start of his gambling business. However, the company started a serious lottery when Adams moved to Hobart in 1895, a move supported by the Tasmanian Government. He set up his first operation there and eventually the company grew and developed in other states. =Tote Tasmania= Tote Tasmania Pty Ltd was a Tasmanian state-owned company, with its shares being held by the Treasurer and Minister for Racing of Tasmania. It had an exclusive right to conduct parimutuel (totalisator) wagering in the state of Tasmania. The company was privatised and sold to Tatts Group for AU$103 million and merged into their operations in 2012. Inheritance When Tattersall's was founded, George Adams structured the company so the original workers' families would inherit the profits. This created so-called \\"Tattersall's heirs\\": subsequent generations inherited a share in the company's profits.

Synopsis On a luxury space liner, one of the passengers, Kistna, is delighted to discover a fellow member of her race, the W√ª√ªrm, called Jal is also travelling on the liner. The W√ª√ªrm are declining in numbers and so to meet a fellow member of the species is a special occasion. After enjoying themselves in the ship's casino and the ballroom, Kistna invites Jal to her cabin to consummate their new-found union. In the cabin, Kistna removes the golden armour that completely covers her body. Jal follows suit, removing his armour to reveal that he is, in fact, a human and not a W√ª√ªrm after all. Jal attacks her and succeeds in his mission ‚Äì to steal Kistna's psychic powers. Wracked with guilt following his deed, Jal puts his disguise back on and makes for the bridge of the ship. He uses his newfound powers to threaten the captain and procure a shuttle craft. He sets the controls for Earth... Earth, the late 1980s. Val√©rian is in Russia, having been hired to examine a leak at a nuclear power plant. His investigations lead him to the conclusion that this accident was deliberately provoked. His work with the Russians finished, they arrange to have him returned to the West where he rendezvous with Laureline and Albert on the Finnish border. Travelling across Finland into Norway they fly off to their next destination in a seaplane. Later, Val√©rian, Laureline and Albert are to be found at a caf√© in a small village in Tunisia. As they wait, they ponder the job they have been asked to work on: none of them, not even Albert, knows who has hired them nor what they are supposed to be doing in Tunisia. Noticing a group of cloaked men heading into the palm forest near the village. Val√©rian and Laureline follow them to a marabout. Using a scanning device, taken from their astroship, they determine that there is a radioactive source inside the marabout. Returning to the village, they report their findings to Albert who makes a call to their mysterious employers. Then they make for the marabout in their truck. Using a cretiniser whip from the planet Phoum, a device that renders its victims cataleptic, they enter the marabout and find the source of the radiation ‚Äì an atomic mine. Deactivating the mine, they flee into the desert to an arranged meeting point near the Libyan border. At the rendezvous they are met by a Tunisian military helicopter. Flying along the Libyan border, their host explains that had the mine been detonated, it would have incited the world powers to respond with a nuclear attack of their own, giving Libya the excuse to invade and destabilise North Africa and precipitate a World war. The helicopter flies on to an airfield where Val√©rian, Laureline and Albert are collected by a jet aircraft. Some time later, the trio are in the United States in Arizona, driving along the border with Mexico. At last, they meet their employers ‚Äì J.D. Eklund, a professor from UCLA attached to the International Atomic Energy Agency and Ivan Gregorian, a commander of the Red Army in charge of nuclear disarmament surveillance. They inform them that there have been multiple alerts at nuclear installations around the world and none of the incidents are coincidental ‚Äì all of these blackmail incidents are being orchestrated by a single mastermind. They bring Val√©rian, Laureline and Albert to a bridge where a convoy of trucks carrying plutonium has been attacked by terrorists threatening to blow up the trucks unless a nuclear submarine is delivered to a port of their choice in the Yellow Sea. However, the intelligence services had received a tipoff about the attack and the trucks, which are in fact empty, are blown up by the US Army. The victory is short-lived however: the train that is carrying the real plutonium is attacked and derailed forcing them to capitulate to the demands for the submarine. One lead still remains however ‚Äì a mysterious stranger who is winning at the casinos in Hong Kong. Laureline arrives at the casino in Hong Kong, wearing a T√ºm T√ºm (de L√ºm) in her hair as a spying device, and finds Jal playing in a high-stakes card game. Glancing at Laureline, Jal recognises the T√ºm T√ºm and snatches it from her hair. He then grabs Laureline, stuffs her in his car and drives over the border with China. Arriving at his home, Jal interrogates Laureline asking if she is from another world or from the future. Slipping to the bathroom, Laureline takes a Tchoung tracer from her handbag and releases it in the hope that it can find Val√©rian. Elsewhere, one of the waiters in the casino has found the T√ºm T√ºm and returned it to Val√©rian and Albert who have returned to Inverloch Castle in Scotland to ponder their next move. Examining its eye, Val√©rian finds it has succeeded in recording an image of their quarry. Val√©rian is shocked to realise he recognises their adversary ‚Äì it is Jal, an agent of the Spatio-Temporal Service just like Val√©rian and Laureline. Val√©rian is puzzled that Jal hasn't disappeared along with Galaxity and the rest of the future Earth. At this point the Tchoung tracer arrives. Analysing its database, they discover Jal's location in China. Parting company with Albert, Val√©rian takes the astroship to China, to Jal's hideout. Val√©rian confronts Jal, who is amazed when he recognises Val√©rian. Jal reveals that he is attempting to cause the nuclear cataclysm that Val√©rian prevented in The Rage of Hypsis so that Galaxity can be restored to the timeline. He explains that the peculiar properties of the Neferfalen nebula where he was exploring protected him from being wiped out along with the rest of Galaxity but at the cost of the woman he had loved. In order to get her back, Jal is attempting to change history back onto its old course. As the standoff continues, Jal's powers become weaker and weaker until eventually he is overcome by Val√©rian and Laureline. Val√©rian and Laureline fly Jal to Point Central, the meeting place for all the races of the cosmos, and make for the Pulpissm's market where they meet the Shingouz. Laureline asks the Shingouz if they can find any other remnants of old Earth. Waiting at the market, they eventually receive a message from the Shingouz ‚Äì at the far side of Point Central they have found a place beyond a material border where the remains of lost and fallen civilisations can be found. Reaching the place they find the ruined remains of Earth's old segment in Point Central. Realising that he was a fool to think he could change history, Jal elects to be left alone with his thoughts on the abandoned segment. Principal characters * Val√©rian, from Galaxity, lost capital of Earth in the 28th century, formerly a Spatio-Temporal Agent, now working on a freelance basis * Laureline, from 11th century France, formerly a Spatio-Temporal Agent for Galaxity, now working on a freelance basis * Mr Albert, Val√©rian and Laureline's contact on 20th century Earth * Jal, a spatio-temporal agent from Galaxity * Kistna, a female from the planet W√ª√ªrm * The captain of the luxury liner where Jal meets Kistna * A fisherman from Lapland * J.D.

The pursuit of the mastermind behind the attempts to start a nuclear incident takes them across the borders of many countries: ** Lapland: the nuclear centre Val√©rian visits is in Russia. He then crosses the border into Finland across a lake where he meets Laureline and Albert. They then drive into Norway where they pick up a hydroplane. ** Tunisia, an oasis, in the Tunisian Sahara in the south of the country, about 15 miles from the border with Libya. The village has a cafe called the Cafe Pigalle. A marabout lies in palm forest outside the village. The Tunisian commandos that Val√©rian, Albert and Laureline meet in the desert take them briefly into Libya before leaving them at an airfield where they move on to their next destination. ** United States, Arizona near the border with Mexico. The exact location of the hijacked trucks is not specified but the train carrying the nuclear material is derailed nearby in Yuma, Arizona. Val√©rian, Laureline and Albert depart for China from Luke Air Force Base. ** Hong Kong, a casino where Jal is using the powers he stole from Kistna to win the money to finance his operations. ** Scotland, Inverloch Castle in the Scottish Highlands where Val√©rian's astroship remains hidden in Lord and Lady Seal's greenhouse (see also The Ghosts of Inverloch and The Rage of Hypsis). ** The People's Republic of China, Jal's house, located not far from the border with Hong Kong. * Point Central, the giant space station that acts as a meeting place for all the races of the cosmos, as seen previously in Ambassador of the Shadows. The segments visited belong to: ** The Ombrians, giant worm-like creatures. ** The Pulpissms, briefly seen in Ambassador of the Shadows, whose giant market, the busiest place on Point Central, attracts visitors, including spies of every race, from all over the station. ** Earth. Although Galaxity is no more, this segment, which is all crumbling and decayed and deserted, lies beyond an immaterial border that links fallen civilisations. Notes * This was the first Val√©rian adventure to make its debut in print in album format. All previous stories were first serialised in Pilote magazine. * This adventure marks the first appearance in the series of the following elements: ** The Cretiniser from Phoum, whip like device that renders anyone within its range catatonic. ** The T√ºm T√ºm (de L√ºm), a working animal which can be worn in the hair as a decoration but can be used as a spy camera thanks to the retinal persistence of its eye. ** The Tchoung Tracer, another working animal that can be freeze dried until needed, at which time it is revived by adding water. It can be trained to home in on a specific person and its point of origin can then be determined by scanning its brain. * The design of the space liner seen at the start of this adventure was later re-used by M√©zi√®res as the basis for the Fhloston Paradise liner seen in the 1997 Luc Besson film The Fifth Element on which he worked as a conceptual artist. * This album was translated into English by Timothy Ryan Smith and published, along with The Living Weapons and The Circles of Power in the same volume, in November 2004 by iBooks under the title Valerian: The New Future Trilogy. The pages were shrunk from their normal size to US comic book size. * The English translation introduces a number of changes and discrepancies into the text: ** The Russians pay Val√©rian in Euro currency even though this story is set more than a decade before its introduction in 2002. ** Lord and Lady Seal are referred to as Lord and Lady Steals. ** The Pulpissms' segment, with its great market, is referred to as the Pulp Market. The translator did not realise that the Pulpissms are an alien race. * Kistna's race is not named in the text of the album itself ‚Äì however, they are given the race name W√ª√ªrm in Les Habitants du Ciel: Atlas Cosmique de Val√©rian et Laureline, the illustrated encyclopedia of the Val√©rian universe.

Background John Payne was born at Peterborough in 1532.Stanton, Richard, A Menology of England and Wales, p.140, Burns & Oates, Ltd., London, 1892 He was probably a mature man when he went to the English College at Douai in 1574, served there as bursar, and was ordained priest by the Archbishop of Cambrai on 7 April 1576.Wainewright, John. \\"Bl. John Payne.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 4 Feb. 2013 Ministry Shortly afterwards, on 24 April 1576, he left for the English mission in the company of another priest, Cuthbert Mayne. While Mayne headed for his native South West England, Payne resided for the most part with Anne, widow of Sir William Petre, and daughter of Sir William Browne, sometime Lord Mayor of the City of London, at Ingatestone, Essex, in whose house was a \\"priest hole\\",Camm OSB, Bede, Lives of the English Martyrs, p.429, Longmans, Green & Co., London, 1914 but also in London. The missioner passed as a steward of Lady Petre. Shortly after his arrival he converted (or re-converted) to Catholicism George Godsalve or Godsalf, of the diocese of Bath, a man who had gained the B.A. at Oxford and had been ordained a deacon in the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary, but who had then become a Protestant. Payne sent Godsalf to Douai, where he arrived on 15 July 1576 to be prepared for the Catholic priesthood, which he was to receive at Cambrai on 22 December. Payne himself was arrested at Ingatestone and imprisoned early in 1577, but was soon released and went back to Douai that November. From there he probably returned to Ingatestone before Christmas, 1579. Arrest Early in July 1581, he and Godsalf, who had come to England in June 1577, were arrested in Warwickshire whilst staying on the estate of Lady Petre (widow of William Petre), through the efforts of the informer George \\"Judas\\" Eliot (a criminal, murderer, rapist and thief, who made a career out of denouncing Catholics and priests for bounty). After being examined by Walsingham at Greenwich, they were committed to the Tower of London on 14 July. Godsalf did not give in but spent several years in prison, after which he was released from the Marshalsea in September 1585 and banished, dying in Paris in 1592. Eliot had insinuated himself into a position in the Petre household where he then proceeded to embezzle sums of money. He enticed a young woman from the Roper household and then appealed to Father Payne to marry them; and on his refusal determined to be revenged and make a profit as well. As to Payne, a more significant catch, he was racked on the Council's orders on 14 August, and again on 31 October. On 20 March 1581/2 he was abruptly woken, taken from his cell half dressed and delivered by the Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir Owen Hopton (c. 1524‚Äì1591) of Cockfield Hall in Suffolk to officers waiting to take him to Chelmsford jail, not being allowed to return to the cell to get his purse - which was purloined by the Lieutenant's wife, Anne Echyngham. Trial Payne was indicted at Chelmsford on 22 March on a charge of treason for conspiring to murder the Queen and her leading officers and install Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. Payne denied the charges, and affirmed his loyalty to the Queen in all that was lawful (i.e. not contrary to his Catholicism or allegiance to the Pope), contesting the reliability of the murderer Eliot. No attempt was made to corroborate Eliot's story, which had already been rehearsed in large part at the trial of Edmund Campion on 20 November 1581. The guilty verdict was a foregone conclusion. Execution At his execution on the morning of the Monday 2 April (nine months after his imprisonment), he was dragged from prison on a hurdle to the place of execution and first prayed on his knees for almost half an hour and then kissed the scaffold, made a profession of faith and declared his innocence. Reinforcements had been sent from London to help the execution run smoothly. Lord Rich called upon him to repent of his treason, which Payne again denied. A Protestant minister then shouted a claim that years ago Payne's brother had admitted to him Payne's treason. Payne said that his brother was and always had been an earnest Protestant but that even so would never swear to such a thing. To bear this out, Payne asked that the brother, who was in the locality, be brought, but he was not found in time and the execution proceeded and Payne was at last turned off the ladder. The government's intentions for a smooth execution with minimal trouble and maximum propaganda value had failed ‚Äì indeed, the crowd had become so sympathetic to Payne that they hung on his feet to speed his death and prevented the infliction of the quartering until he was dead. The executioner, Simon Bull, was meanwhile rebuked for dithering over the quartering in case Payne revive and suffer further.Challoner, Richard. Memoirs of Missionary Priests, Thomas Richardson & son, 1843, p. 90 Beatification and canonisation John Payne was one of the group of prominent Catholic martyrs of the persecution who were later designated as the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. He was beatified \\"equipollently\\" by Pope Leo XIII, by means of a decree of 29 December 1886 and was canonised along with the other Martyrs of England and Wales by Pope Paul VI on 25 October 1970. Schools and churches A Roman Catholic secondary school in Chelmsford town centre (towards Broomfield) is now named after him. The name of the school is St John Payne Catholic School. The Roman Catholic church of St John Payne is found on Colchester's Greenstead estate.

He is one of the most prolific and highly regarded scriptwriters in Taiwan and a leading member of the New Taiwanese Cinema, although he has also acted in a number of films. He starred in Edward Yang's 2000 film Yi Yi. Wu is a well-known supporter of the Democratic Progressive Party and has filmed commercials for the party. Biography Wu was born into a coal miner's family in 1952 and raised in the mining town of Jiufen. He went into the army after high school, and after being discharged in 1976, went to work at a library while pursuing a degree in accounting at the Fu Jen Catholic University night school. He started writing short stories for newspapers in 1975, when he was still an accounting major. After penning his first screenplay in 1978, Wu entered Central Motion Picture Corporation as a creative supervisor and worked with several leading Taiwanese New Wave directors such as Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang. Wu has since wrote more than 70 screenplays that were made into films, and has become one of the leading artists of the Taiwanese Cinema of the 1980s. Wu has also set the record for winning the most Golden Horse Awards to date (Taiwan's Film Awards), including a collaboration with the internationally acclaimed Hong Kong director Ann Hui on her film Song of Exile, a.k.a. Ketu Qiuhen (1990). His novels and screenplays have also made him one of Taiwan's best-selling authors. Writing =Fiction= Wu started writing short stories while he was still a college student at the Fu Jen Catholic University in Taipei studying accounting, publishing his first short story in a newspaper at the age of seventeen. In an interview with film scholar Michael Berry, Wu stated that \\"I was already working in Taipei at that time, and the extra money I earned from publishing my stories in the newspapers actually added up to more than my salary, which made me very happy and inspired me to keep on writing.\\" He started making a name for himself on the Taiwanese literary scene with a series of popular and commercially successful short story collections, including Grab on to Spring (Êäì‰Ωè‰∏ÄÂÄãÊò•Â§©) (Zhuazhu yige chuntian)(1977). Other popular novels by Wu include: Special of the Day (ÁâπÂà•ÁöÑ‰∏ÄÂ§©) (1988), Taiwan, Tell The Truth (Ëá∫ÁÅ£ÂøµÁúüÊÉÖ) (2002), Year-old a person to travel (ÂÖ´Ê≠≤‰∏ÄÂÄã‰∫∫ÂéªÊóÖË°å) (2003), These people, those things (ÈÄô‰∫õ‰∫∫ÔºåÈÇ£‰∫õ‰∫ã) (2010) and Taiwan, Say the Truth (Âè∞ÁÅ£ÂøµÁúüÊÉÖ) (2011). One of Wu's role models and mentors as a writer was Cheng Ching-wen, who wrote the short story collection Three-Legged Horse. Wu said of the mentorship provided by Cheng: > \\"Cheng Ching-wen was really a kind of role model for me. I was twenty- > something when I was discharged from the military. At the time, it was > extremely difficult to find a job if one was not well educated. I knew that > taking on an apprenticeship to learn a trade would require much more time > than just entering the university, so I decided to do the latter. I knew > Cheng Ching-wen and consulted him when I was trying to decide what to study > and which universities to apply to. Cheng was working in a bank and writing > fiction in his spare time. His job at the bank provided financial stability > for him and his family while writing accommodated his own interests. He once > told me, \\"You can only truly enjoy writing as an act of literary creation > when there is no financial burden hanging over your head.\\" This really > resonated with me, and I decided to apply for something that would > eventually help me to find a job - business school became my first choice. > But I never went into business because by my senior year I was already > working for CMPC, writing screenplays. I did eventually finish my studies, > however.\\" =Screenwriting= Wu's storytelling talents and penchant for realistic dialogue caught the attention of a Taiwanese movie studio named Central Motion Picture Corporation (CMPC), which hired him as a scriptwriter and creative supervisor while he was still finishing his college studies. By 1981, Wu had won his first Golden Horse Best Screenplay Award for writing Ching-chieh Lin's Classmates (Tong ban tong xue) (1981).IMDb, Tong ban tong xue - Awards & Nominations, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5097584/awards?ref_=tt_awd Wu would go on to win 5 more Golden Horse \\"Best Original Screenplay\\", \\"Best Adapted Screenplay\\" or \\"Best Original Film Song\\" awards later on in his career, for the films: Lao Mo de di er ge chun tian (1984) (Best Original Screenplay, 1984),IMDb, Nien-Jen Wu - Awards & Nominations, https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943150/awards?ref_=nm_awd The Two of Us (1987) (Best Adapted Screenplay, 1987), Kun Hao Chen's Gui hua xiang (1987) (Best Original Film Song, shared with Yang Chen), Anne Hui's Song of the Exile (1990) (Best Original Screenplay, 1990), and Toon Wang's Wu yan de shan qiu (1992)(Best Original Screenplay, 1992).

The Schniarfeur's weapons are its irritating voice and its destructive spit. The planet Bromn is so dangerous that all its inhabitants, including the Schniarfeur, are in a state of perpetual aggression. A Schniarfeur's aggression can be tempered by operating on its chabounal gland. * Rompf, a Lord of War from Blopik. * Wauk, a Lord of War from Blopik and Rompf's rival. Settings * Blopik, the third planet in the Constellation of Orpheus. Blopikians are a mixture of minotaur and centaur having the head of a bull and the body of a horse. Despite their fearsome appearance, they are ruminants. Their planet is mostly rocky, primarily red and brown in colour with many canyons and ravines. Primitive wooded bridges connect the ravines. The Blopikian natives regularly make war on their great plains. When the forests of the high ranges reach maturity and bear fruit, the Blopikians set them on fire to start the war between the rival tribes. * Earth, Russia, the late 1980s after the events of On the Frontiers but before the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Cwmbach means 'Little Valley' in Welsh (Cwm = valley, Bach = little). Cwmbach has a population of 5,117 (mid-2017 estimate). Prior to the industrial revolution, Cwmbach consisted of a number of farms and homesteads; in the early to mid-19th century it became a significant coal mining community. History There is evidence of inhabitation in the Cwmbach area since prehistoric times, with the mountains above Cwmbach littered with earthworks, and cairns of a religious, rituary and funerary type. Five of these are registered with Cadw. The Craig-Y-gilfach earthwork is ideally situated at the top of the mountain, giving protection from both the Cynon and Merthyr valleys. Despite its early inhabitation, Cwmbach like most of the Cynon Valley was a quiet isolated area made up of farms and homesteads before the coming of industry. Its rural calm was first disturbed by the building of the Aberdare canal which opened in May 1812, with traffic passing through the area now known as Cwmbach in order to reach the canal head further to the north or join with the Glamorganshire canal to the south. Originally opened for trade with the iron industry of the Aberdare region, the canal found itself ideally situated when in 1837 the first deep pit was sunk at Abernant-Y-Groes Colliery (later known as Cwmbach colliery). A further pit was later sunk and named Lletyshenkin Colliery. All coal was subsequently exported via the canal and train systems to Cardiff Docks. The location of Cwmbach pit is today marked by an RCT Heritage Trail plaque at Pit Place. Within the space of only a few years there were horrific explosions. At Cwmbach pit in 1846 28 miners were killed, followed by the deaths within three weeks of four others who had been seriously injured in the incident. At Lletty Shenkin colliery in 1849 there were 53 deaths. At Cwmbach colliery there were two deaths in 1852 and at Lletty-shenkyn colliery there were five deaths in 1853 and two in 1862. The Lletty Shenkin explosion of 1849, in particular, led to demands by the local middle classes in Aberdare for improved safety in the mines. Steam coal mines were particularly susceptible to explosions and prominent figures such as Thomas Price, called for the introduction of mines' inspectors who would visit collieries on a regular basis, at least once a month, to carry out inspections. This policy was, however, opposed by the miners who demanded that the inspections be carried out by experienced colliers. As a result, little happened for many years. As the collieries expanded so did the village of Cwmbach. However, the closures of the pits (the final colliery Lletty Shenkin closed in 1922) resulted in high emigration and poverty. In the 1950s Cwmbach prospered with a large number of new council houses that were built at the lower end of Cwmbach and to the south. This housing stock was transferred to RCT Homes in 2010 a private not for profit social housing provider. The 1950s also brought building on the site of the former Pant Farm; these were all private houses made of up houses and bungalows. Today's Cwmbach is a mixture of both social and private housing. An area known as Tirfounder Fields was cleared and building work started in 2001 for a retail park. In Cwmbach, the first Cooperative society shop in Wales was established in 1860 in Bridge Road. The building was demolished in 1977. Governance Cwmbach is also the name of an electoral ward with boundaries coterminous with the community. The Cwmbach ward has elected a county councillor to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council since 1995. It has been represented by the Labour Party for the whole of that period, with Councillor Jeffrey Elliott of the Labour and Co-operative parties being incumbent since 2012.Rhondda Cyon Taff County Borough Council Election Results 1995-2012, The Election Centre.

Culture and Cwmbach Male Choir The Cwmbach Male Choir was formed in 1921 and were the first choir to sing at Cardiff Arms Park prior to an international rugby match. Local history being that they were formed at a local cricket match held in June 1921. A number of the crowd watching the game became uninterested in the play and began to sing hymns and part songs. This led to the suggestion that a male choir be formed. From this a meeting was held at the Cwmbach Hall and Institute and the Cwmbach Male Choir became a reality. The choir has shared a concert platform with some world-famous artists, including Paul Robeson, Sir Geraint Evans, Stuart Burrows, Dame Gwyneth Jones, Constance Shacklock, Patricia Kern and the internationally renowned guitarist John Williams. The poet Harri Webb lived in Cwmbach for a number of years (until the mid-1990s). Places of worship Situated on Bridge Road is St. Mary Magdalene's. This is a Church in Wales church at the heart of the community and is over 130 years old. It has undergone a ¬£140,000 restoration, replacing the roof and re-hanging a bell which had been missing for 15 years. During the works, services were held at the Church Hall next door. Cornerstone Church on Sion Terrace is an Evangelical church, but is also home to the Cornerstone Project, delivering classes, youth activities and training to the local population. Bethania Baptist chapel was badly damaged by wartime bombing in 1941 but was subsequently restored. However, the chapel closed in the 1980s and was demolished in 1995. Schools Cwmbach has two schools, Cwmbach Community Primary School and Cwmbach Church in Wales School. Both schools provide education facilities for nursery, infant and junior ages. Sports Cwmbach is home to two football teams, Cwmbach Royal Stars and Royal Oak. Community buildings Cwmbach has a police station and is used as a base by the local community police. The station is not listed by South Wales Police as it has no service counter but is open to the public when police officers are working. The small Cwmbach Library was located on Morgan Row, but closed in 2014. There were plans for its demolition and five houses to be built on the site.\\"Former library closed in council cuts could soon be demolished and rebuilt as homes\\", Wales Online, 17 March 2015.

The strategy involves using reverse psychology (and luck) to deceive the enemy into thinking that an empty location is full of traps and ambushes, and therefore induce the enemy to retreat. Some examples are listed in the following sections. Cao Cao According to the Sanguozhi, in 195, the Empty Fort Strategy was used by the warlord Cao Cao against his rival L√º Bu in one incident at Chengshi County (‰πòÊ∞èÁ∏£; southwest of present-day Juye County, Shandong). In the summer of that year, L√º Bu went to Dongmin County (Êù±Á∑°Á∏£; northeast of present-day Jinxiang County, Shandong) and gathered about 10,000 troops to attack Cao Cao. At the time, Cao Cao had very few soldiers with him, so he set up an ambush and defeated L√º Bu.(‰∫åÂπ¥Êò•ÔºåË•≤ÂÆöÈô∂„ÄÇÊøüÈô∞Â§™ÂÆàÂê≥Ë≥á‰øùÂçóÂüéÔºåÊú™Êãî„ÄÇÊúÉÂëÇÂ∏ÉËá≥ÔºåÂèàÊìäÁ†¥‰πã„ÄÇÂ§èÔºåÂ∏ÉÂ∞áËñõËò≠„ÄÅÊùéÂ∞ÅÂ±ØÈíúÈáéÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÊîª‰πãÔºåÂ∏ÉÊïëËò≠ÔºåËò≠ÊïóÔºåÂ∏ÉËµ∞ÔºåÈÅÇÊñ¨Ëò≠Á≠â„ÄÇÂ∏ÉË§áÂæûÊù±Á∑°ËàáÈô≥ÂÆÆÂ∞áËê¨È§ò‰∫∫‰æÜÊà∞ÔºåÊôÇÂ§™Á•ñÂÖµÂ∞ëÔºåË®≠‰ºèÔºåÁ∏±Â•áÂÖµÊìäÔºåÂ§ßÁ†¥‰πã„ÄÇÂ∏ÉÂ§úËµ∞ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñË§áÊîªÔºåÊãîÂÆöÈô∂ÔºåÂàÜÂÖµÂπ≥Ë´∏Á∏£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1. The Wei Shu (È≠èÊõ∏) gave a more detailed account of the ambush. Cao Cao had sent his troops out to collect grain so he had less than 1,000 men with him in his base, which was not well defended. When L√º Bu showed up, Cao Cao sent all his available soldiers to defend the base and even ordered women to stand guard on the walls. To the west of Cao Cao's base was a dyke, and to its south was a deep forest. L√º Bu suspected that there was an ambush, so he told his men, \\"Cao Cao is very cunning. We must not fall into his ambush.\\" He then led his troops to 10 li south of Cao Cao's base and set up his camp there. The following day, L√º Bu came to attack Cao Cao, and by then, Cao Cao had really set up an ambush near the dyke. L√º Bu's forces fell into the ambush and were defeated.(È≠èÊõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÊñºÊòØÂÖµÁöÜÂá∫ÂèñÈ∫•ÔºåÂú®ËÄÖ‰∏çËÉΩÂçÉ‰∫∫ÔºåÂ±ØÁáü‰∏çÂõ∫„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñ‰πÉ‰ª§Â©¶‰∫∫ÂÆàÈô¥ÔºåÊÇâÂÖµÊãí‰πã„ÄÇÂ±ØË•øÊúâÂ§ßÂ†§ÔºåÂÖ∂ÂçóÊ®πÊú®ÂπΩÊ∑±„ÄÇÂ∏ÉÁñëÊúâ‰ºèÔºå‰πÉÁõ∏Ë¨ÇÊõ∞Ôºö‚ÄúÊõπÊìçÂ§öË≠éÔºåÂãøÂÖ•‰ºè‰∏≠„ÄÇ‚ÄùÂºïËªçÂ±ØÂçóÂçÅÈ§òË£è„ÄÇÊòéÊó•Ë§á‰æÜÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÈö±ÂÖµÂ†§Ë£èÔºåÂá∫ÂçäÂÖµÂ†§Â§ñ„ÄÇÂ∏ÉÁõäÈÄ≤Ôºå‰πÉ‰ª§ËºïÂÖµÊåëÊà∞ÔºåÊó¢ÂêàÔºå‰ºèÂÖµ‰πÉÊÇâ‰πòÂ†§ÔºåÊ≠•È®é‰∏¶ÈÄ≤ÔºåÂ§ßÁ†¥‰πãÔºåÁç≤ÂÖ∂ÈºìËªäÔºåËøΩËá≥ÂÖ∂ÁáüËÄåÈÇÑ„ÄÇ) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1. The \\"ambush\\" mentioned in the Sanguozhi refers to the ambush that L√º Bu's forces fell into on the second day, as described in the Wei Shu. The incident is also mentioned in Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian. However, the Zizhi Tongjian account, which combined the Sanguozhi and Wei Shu accounts, did not mention the events on the first day ‚Äì about Cao Cao sending all his available soldiers to defend the base and ordering women to stand guard on the walls.(Â∏ÉÂæ©ÂæûÊù±Á∑°ËàáÈô≥ÂÆÆÂ∞áËê¨È§ò‰∫∫‰æÜÊà∞ÔºåÊìçÂÖµÁöÜÂá∫Êî∂È∫•ÔºåÂú®ËÄÖ‰∏çËÉΩÂçÉ‰∫∫ÔºåÂ±ØÁáü‰∏çÂõ∫„ÄÇÂ±ØË•øÊúâÂ§ßÂ†§ÔºåÂÖ∂ÂçóÊ®πÊú®ÂπΩÊ∑±ÔºåÊìçÈö±ÂÖµÂ†§Ë£°ÔºåÂá∫ÂçäÂÖµÂ†§Â§ñ„ÄÇÂ∏ÉÁõäÈÄ≤Ôºå‰πÉ‰ª§ËºïÂÖµÊåëÊà∞ÔºåÊó¢ÂêàÔºå‰ºèÂÖµ‰πÉÊÇâ‰πòÂ†§ÔºåÊ≠•È®é‰∏¶„ÄîÈÄ≤„Äï(ËøΩ)ÔºåÂ§ßÁ†¥‰πãÔºåËøΩËá≥ÂÖ∂ÁáüËÄåÈÇÑ„ÄÇÂ∏ÉÂ§úËµ∞ÔºåÊìçÂæ©ÊîªÊãîÂÆöÈô∂ÔºåÂàÜÂÖµÂπ≥Ë´∏Á∏£„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 61. =Debate= Yi Zhongtian, a history professor from Xiamen University, commented on this incident in his book Pin San Guo (ÂìÅ‰∏âÂõΩ) in response to criticism from Fudan University historian Zhou Zhenhe and an online commentator known as \\"Hongchayangweili\\" (Á∫¢Ëå∂Êù®Â®ÅÂà©). Earlier on, Yi referred to this incident when he said in a lecture on the television programme Lecture Room that \\"Cao Cao's rights to the invention of the Empty Fort Strategy had been stolen from him\\". Zhou claimed that the Empty Fort Strategy had never been used in history before so there were no \\"rights\\" to its invention; the online commentator argued that the incident does not count as a use of the Empty Fort Strategy. Yi defended his claim and said that the incident in 195 is valid because of the circumstances under which it was used, which were very similar to the incidents involving Zhao Yun and Wen Ping (see the sections below). Cao Cao was trying to confuse L√º Bu by making use of the geographical features (the \\"deep forest\\") and by ordering women to stand guard on the walls, so as to make L√º Bu suspect that he had set up an ambush in the \\"deep forest\\" and lure L√º Bu to attack his \\"weakly defended\\" base by deploying women as soldiers to show how \\"desperate\\" he was to set up a defence. The ploy worked because it made L√º Bu hesitate when he wanted to attack. Cao Cao had bought sufficient time to set up a real ambush, and he defeated L√º Bu when he came to attack again on the following day. Zhao Yun The Zhao Yun Biezhuan (Ë∂ôÈõ≤Âà•ÂÇ≥; Unofficial Biography of Zhao Yun) mentioned an incident about Zhao Yun, a general under the warlord Liu Bei, using the Empty Fort Strategy during the Battle of Han River in 219, fought between Liu Bei and his rival Cao Cao as part of the Hanzhong Campaign. This incident took place after Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan was defeated and killed in action at the earlier Battle of Mount Dingjun. Cao Cao's forces were transporting food supplies to the north hill when Liu Bei's general Huang Zhong heard about it and led a group of soldiers, including some of Zhao Yun's men, to seize the supplies. Huang Zhong did not return after a long time so Zhao Yun led tens of horsemen in search of Huang. Zhao Yun encountered Cao Cao's forces and engaged them in battle but was outnumbered and was forced to retreat back to his camp, with Cao Cao's men in pursuit. Zhao Yun's subordinate Zhang Yi wanted to close the gates of the camp to prevent the enemy from entering. However, Zhao Yun gave orders for the gates to be opened, all flags and banners to be hidden, and the war drums silenced. Cao Cao's forces thought that there was an ambush inside Zhao Yun's camp so they withdrew. Just then, Zhao Yun launched a counterattack and his men beat the war drums loudly and fired arrows at the enemy. Cao Cao's soldiers were shocked and thrown into disarray. Some of them trampled on each other while fleeing in panic, and many of them fell into the Han River and drowned. When Liu Bei came to inspect the camp later, he praised Zhao Yun and threw a banquet to celebrate his victory.(Â§è‰æØÊ∑µÊïóÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨Áà≠Êº¢‰∏≠Âú∞ÔºåÈÅãÁ±≥ÂåóÂ±±‰∏ãÔºåÊï∏ÂçÉËê¨Âõä„ÄÇÈªÉÂø†‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂèØÂèñÔºåÈõ≤ÂÖµÈö®Âø†ÂèñÁ±≥„ÄÇÂø†ÈÅéÊúü‰∏çÈÇÑÔºåÈõ≤Â∞áÊï∏ÂçÅÈ®éËºïË°åÂá∫ÂúçÔºåËøéË¶ñÂø†Á≠â„ÄÇÂÄºÊõπÂÖ¨ÊèöÂÖµÂ§ßÂá∫ÔºåÈõ≤ÁÇ∫ÂÖ¨ÂâçÈãíÊâÄÊìäÔºåÊñπÊà∞ÔºåÂÖ∂Â§ßÁúæËá≥ÔºåÂã¢ÂÅ™ÔºåÈÅÇÂâçÁ™ÅÂÖ∂Èô≥Ôºå‰∏îÈ¨•‰∏îÂçª„ÄÇÂÖ¨ËªçÊï£ÔºåÂ∑≤Âæ©ÂêàÔºåÈõ≤Èô∑ÊïµÔºåÈÇÑË∂£Âúç„ÄÇÂ∞áÂºµËëóË¢´ÂâµÔºåÈõ≤Âæ©È¶≥È¶¨ÈÇÑÁáüËøéËëó„ÄÇÂÖ¨ËªçËøΩËá≥ÂúçÔºåÊ≠§ÊôÇÊ≤îÈôΩÈï∑ÂºµÁøºÂú®Èõ≤ÂúçÂÖßÔºåÁøºÊ¨≤ÈñâÈñÄÊãíÂÆàÔºåËÄåÈõ≤ÂÖ•ÁáüÔºåÊõ¥Â§ßÈñãÈñÄÔºåÂÅÉÊóóÊÅØÈºì„ÄÇÂÖ¨ËªçÁñëÈõ≤Êúâ‰ºèÂÖµÔºåÂºïÂéª„ÄÇÈõ≤Èõ∑ÈºìÈúáÂ§©ÔºåÊÉü‰ª•ÊàéÂº©ÊñºÂæåÂ∞ÑÂÖ¨ËªçÔºåÂÖ¨ËªçÈ©öÈß≠ÔºåËá™Áõ∏ËπÇË∏êÔºåÂ¢ÆÊº¢Ê∞¥‰∏≠Ê≠ªËÄÖÁîöÂ§ö„ÄÇÂÖà‰∏ªÊòéÊó¶Ëá™‰æÜËá≥Èõ≤ÁáüÂúçË¶ñÊò®Êà∞ËôïÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ≠êÈæç‰∏ÄË∫´ÈÉΩÊòØËÜΩ‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç‰ΩúÊ®ÇÈ£≤ÂÆ¥Ëá≥ÊöùÔºåËªç‰∏≠ËôüÈõ≤ÁÇ∫ËôéÂ®ÅÂ∞áËªç„ÄÇ) Zhao Yun Biezhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 36. Wen Ping The Weil√ºe mentioned an incident about the Empty Fort Strategy being used by a general Wen Ping during a battle between the forces of the states of Cao Wei and Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period. It is not clear which battle this was, but it could be the Battle of Jiangling of 223. The Wu leader Sun Quan led thousands of troops to attack a fortress defended by the Wei general Wen Ping. At the time, there were heavy rains and much of the fortifications were damaged. The civilians in the fortress had retreated to the fields so they could not help the defenders repair the fortifications in time. When Wen Ping heard that Sun Quan had arrived, he was unsure of what to do, but eventually thought of using deception. He ordered everyone in the fortress to stay under cover while he hid behind the walls, creating an illusion of an empty fortress. As Wen Ping expected, Sun Quan became suspicious and he said to his subordinates, \\"The northerners regard this man (Wen Ping) as a loyal subject, which is why they entrusted him with defending this commandery. Now, as I approach, he does not make any move. It must be either that he has something up his sleeve or that his reinforcements have arrived.\\" Sun Quan then withdrew his forces.(È≠èÁï•Êõ∞ÔºöÂ≠´Ê¨äÂòóËá™Â∞áÊï∏Ëê¨ÁúæÂçíËá≥„ÄÇÊôÇÂ§ßÈõ®ÔºåÂüéÊüµÂ¥©Â£ûÔºå‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊï£Âú®Áî∞ÈáéÔºåÊú™ÂèäË£úÊ≤ª„ÄÇËÅòËÅûÊ¨äÂà∞Ôºå‰∏çÁü•ÊâÄÊñΩÔºå‰πÉÊÄùÊÉüËé´Ëã•ÊΩõÈªòÂèØ‰ª•Áñë‰πã„ÄÇ‰πÉÊïïÂüé‰∏≠‰∫∫‰Ωø‰∏çÂæóË¶ãÔºåÂèàËá™Ëá•Ëàç‰∏≠‰∏çËµ∑„ÄÇÊ¨äÊûúÁñë‰πãÔºåË™ûÂÖ∂ÈÉ®Èª®Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂåóÊñπ‰ª•Ê≠§‰∫∫Âø†Ëá£‰πüÔºåÊïÖÂßî‰πã‰ª•Ê≠§ÈÉ°Ôºå‰ªäÊàëËá≥ËÄå‰∏çÂãïÔºåÊ≠§‰∏çÊúâÂØÜÂúñÔºåÂøÖÁï∂ÊúâÂ§ñÊïë„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇ‰∏çÊï¢ÊîªËÄåÂéª„ÄÇÈ≠èÁï•Ê≠§Ë™ûÔºåËàáÊú¨ÂÇ≥Âèç„ÄÇ) Weil√ºe annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 18.

Zhuge Liang Wooden sculptures of Sima Yi's army fleeing from an old man sweeping in front of an empty city, in Huaxilou, Bozhou, Anhui One of the best known examples of the use of the Empty Fort Strategy is a fictional incident in the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises historical events in the late Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. This event took place during the first of a series of campaigns ‚Äì known as Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions ‚Äì led by Shu Han's chancellor Zhuge Liang to attack Shu's rival state, Cao Wei. In the first Northern Expedition, Zhuge Liang's efforts to conquer the Wei city Chang'an were undermined by the Shu defeat at the Battle of Jieting. With the loss of Jieting (present-day Qin'an County, Gansu), Zhuge Liang's current location, Xicheng (Ë•øÂüé; believed to be located 120 li southwest of present-day Tianshui, Gansu), became exposed and was in peril of being attacked by the Wei army. In the face of imminent danger, with the main Shu army deployed elsewhere and only a small group of soldiers in Xicheng, Zhuge Liang came up with a ploy to hold off the approaching enemy. Zhuge Liang ordered all the gates to be opened and instructed soldiers disguised as civilians to sweep the roads while he sat on the viewing platform above the gates with two page boys flanking him. He put on a calm and composed image by playing his guqin. When the Wei army led by Sima Yi arrived, Sima was surprised by the scene before him and he ordered a retreat after suspecting that there was an ambush inside the city. Zhuge Liang later explained that his strategy was a risky one. It worked because Zhuge Liang had a reputation for being a careful military tactician who hardly took risks, so Sima Yi came to the conclusion that there was an ambush upon seeing Zhuge's relaxed composure.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 95-96. =As a topic of academic study= Christopher Cotton, an economist from the Queen's University, and Chang Liu, a graduate student, used game theory to model the bluffing strategies used in the Chinese military legends of Li Guang and his 100 horsemen (144 BC), and Zhuge Liang and the Empty City (228 AD). In the case of these military legends, the researchers found that bluffing arose naturally as the optimal strategy in each situation. The findings were published under the title 100 Horsemen and the empty city: A game theoretic examination of deception in Chinese military legend in the Journal of Peace Research in 2011.The full reference of the work is: C.

In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi added the anecdote as an annotation to Zhuge Liang's biography in the third- century historical text Sanguozhi. The anecdote is as follows: After adding the anecdote to Zhuge Liang's biography, Pei Songzhi wrote a short commentary as follows: Evidence from historical sources indicate that Sima Yi was indeed not in Jieting at the time. The Battle of Jieting took place in 228 but Sima Yi's biography in the Book of Jin claimed that in 227, Sima Yi was stationed at Wancheng in the north of Jing Province. He led an army to suppress a rebellion by Meng Da at Xincheng (Êñ∞Âüé; in present-day northwestern Hubei), and returned to Wancheng after his victory. Later, he went to the imperial capital Luoyang to meet the Wei emperor Cao Rui, who consulted him on some affairs before ordering him to return to Wancheng.(Â§™ÂíåÂÖÉÂπ¥ÂÖ≠ÊúàÔºåÂ§©Â≠êË©îÂ∏ùÂ±ØÊñºÂÆõÔºåÂä†Áù£Ëçä„ÄÅË±´‰∫åÂ∑ûË´∏Ëªç‰∫ã„ÄÇ ...

Yi Zhongtian, a professor from Xiamen University, commented on this incident in his book Pin San Guo (ÂìÅ‰∏âÂõΩ). He pointed out three problems in the story: # Sima Yi did not dare to attack because he feared that there was an ambush inside the fortress. If so, he could have sent recces to scout ahead and check if there was really an ambush. # Romance of the Three Kingdoms provided this description: \\"(Sima Yi) saw Zhuge Liang sitting at the top of the gates, smiling and playing his guqin and being oblivious to his surroundings.\\"(ÊûúË¶ãÂ≠îÊòéÂùêÊñºÂüéÊ®ì‰πã‰∏äÔºåÁ¨ëÂÆπÂèØÊé¨ÔºåÂÇçËã•ÁÑ°‰∫∫ÁÑöÈ¶ôÊìçÁê¥„ÄÇ) Sanguo Yanyi ch. 95. Based on this description, the distance between Sima Yi and Zhuge Liang must have been very short, or else Sima would not have been able to observe Zhuge's actions so clearly. If so, Sima Yi could have ordered an archer to kill Zhuge Liang. # Both Guo Chong's anecdote and Romance of the Three Kingdoms said that Sima Yi's army was superior to Zhuge Liang's in terms of size: Guo Chong's anecdote stated that Sima Yi had 200,000 men while Zhuge Liang had 10,000 men; Romance of the Three Kingdoms mentioned that Sima Yi had 150,000 men while Zhuge Liang had only 2,500 men.(ÂøΩÁÑ∂ÂçÅÈ§òÊ¨°È£õÈ¶¨Â†±Âà∞ÔºåË™™Âè∏È¶¨ÊáøÂºïÂ§ßËªçÂçÅ‰∫îËê¨ÔºåÊúõË•øÂüéËúÇÊìÅËÄå‰æÜ„ÄÇÊôÇÂ≠îÊòéË∫´ÈÇä‰∏¶ÁÑ°Â§ßÂ∞áÔºåÂè™Êúâ‰∏ÄÁè≠ÊñáÂÆòÔºåÊâÄÂºï‰∫îÂçÉËªçÔºåÂ∑≤ÂàÜ‰∏ÄÂçäÂÖàÈÅãÁ≥ßËçâÂéª‰∫ÜÔºåÂè™Ââ©‰∫åÂçÉ‰∫îÁôæËªçÂú®Âüé‰∏≠„ÄÇ) Sanguo Yanyi ch. 95. If so, Sima Yi could have ordered his troops to surround Zhuge Liang's fortress first, and then wait for an opportunity to attack. Li Yuan According to historical sources such as the Old Book of Tang, New Book of Tang and Zizhi Tongjian, Li Yuan, the founding emperor of the Tang dynasty, used a similar strategy in 618 CE in a battle against the Turks before he started his rebellion against the Sui dynasty. In early 618, Li Yuan was still a Sui general and his base was Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ; present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi). When he heard rumours that Emperor Yang wanted to execute him, he started making preparations for a rebellion against the Sui dynasty to save himself. In May 618, the Turks allied with the warlord Liu Wuzhuo to attack the Sui dynasty in order to gain territory. Jinyang became one of their targets. Around the time, Li Yuan had just arrested Wang Wei (ÁéãÂ®Å) and Gao Junya (È´òÂêõÈõÖ), two officials sent by Emperor Yang to spy on him. He was also still busy plotting his rebellion.(ÂâØÁïôÂÆàËôéË≥ÅÈÉéÂ∞áÁéãÂ®Å„ÄÅËôéÁâôÈÉéÂ∞áÈ´òÂêõÈõÖË¶ãÂÖµÂ§ßÈõÜÔºåÁñëÊúâËÆäÔºåË¨ÄÂõ†Á¶±Èõ®ÊôâÁ•†‰ª•ÂúñÈ´òÁ•ñ„ÄÇÈ´òÁ•ñË¶∫‰πãÔºå‰πÉÈô∞ÁÇ∫ÂÇô„ÄÇ‰∫îÊúàÁî≤Â≠êÔºåÈ´òÁ•ñÂèäÂ®Å„ÄÅÂêõÈõÖË¶ñ‰∫ãÔºåÈñãÈôΩÂ∫úÂè∏È¶¨ÂäâÊîøÊúÉÂëäÂ®Å„ÄÅÂêõÈõÖÂèçÔºåÂç≥Âùê‰∏äÂü∑‰πã„ÄÇ‰∏ôÂØÖÔºåÁ™ÅÂé•ÁäØÈÇäÔºåÈ´òÁ•ñ‰ª§Ëªç‰∏≠Êõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∫∫ÂëäÂ®Å„ÄÅÂêõÈõÖÂè¨Á™ÅÂé•Ôºå‰ªäÂÖ∂ÊûúÁÑ∂„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇÊÆ∫‰πã‰ª•Ëµ∑ÂÖµ„ÄÇ) Xin Tang Shu vol. 1. Moreover, he was also not prepared for a battle against the Turks because of two reasons. Firstly, the Turk cavalry was so powerful that Li Yuan was not confident that his troops could defeat the enemy. Secondly, even if Li Yuan won the battle, he would nonetheless suffer significant losses that would undermine his rebellion against the Sui dynasty. Li Yuan thus ordered his soldiers to hide in Jinyang and leave the city gates wide open. Shibi Khan, who led the Turk cavalry, saw that the city appeared to be deserted and feared that there might be an ambush, so he did not enter. Li Yuan then ordered his son Li Shimin and subordinate Pei Ji to make their troops beat war drums loudly in the empty camps they had set up earlier, so as to create an illusion that reinforcements had arrived in Jinyang. Shibi Khan was so frightened that he retreated after two days.(ÊôÇ‰∏ñÊ∞ëÂ∑≤Â∏ÉÂÖµÂ°ûË°¢Ë∑ØÔºåÊñáÈùúÂõ†ËàáÂäâÂºòÂü∫„ÄÅÈï∑Â≠´È†ÜÂæ∑Á≠âÂÖ±Âü∑Â®Å„ÄÅÂêõÈõÖÁπ´ÁçÑ„ÄÇ‰∏ôÂØÖÔºåÁ™ÅÂé•Êï∏Ëê¨Ë°ÜÂØáÊôâÈôΩÔºåËºïÈ®éÂÖ•Â§ñÈÉ≠ÂåóÈñÄÔºåÂá∫ÂÖ∂Êù±ÈñÄ„ÄÇÊ∑µÂëΩË£¥ÂØÇÁ≠âÂãíÂÖµÁÇ∫ÂÇôÔºåËÄåÊÇâÈñãË´∏ÂüéÈñÄÔºåÁ™ÅÂé•‰∏çËÉΩÊ∏¨ÔºåËé´Êï¢ÈÄ≤„ÄÇË°Ü‰ª•ÁÇ∫Â®Å„ÄÅÂêõÈõÖÂØ¶Âè¨‰πã‰πüÔºåÊ∑µÊñºÊòØÊñ¨Â®Å„ÄÅÂêõÈõÖ‰ª•Âæá„ÄÇÊ∑µÈÉ®Â∞áÁéãÂ∫∑ÈÅîÂ∞áÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫Âá∫Êà∞ÔºåÁöÜÊ≠ªÔºåÂüé‰∏≠Âø∑Êáº„ÄÇÊ∑µÂ§úÈÅ£ËªçÊΩõÂá∫ÂüéÔºåÊó¶ÂâáÂºµÊóóÈ≥¥ÈºìËá™‰ªñÈÅì‰æÜÔºåÂ¶ÇÊè¥ËªçËÄÖÔºõÁ™ÅÂé•ÁµÇÁñë‰πãÔºåÁïôÂüéÂ§ñ‰∫åÊó•ÔºåÂ§ßÊé†ËÄåÂéª„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 183. Battle of Mikatagahara Many traditions say that in 1572, during the Sengoku Period in Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu used the tactic during his retreat in the Battle of Mikatagahara. He commanded that the fortress gates remain open, and that braziers be lit to guide his retreating army back to safety. One officer beat a large war drum, seeking to add encouragement to the returning men of a noble, courageous retreat. When the enemy forces, led by Baba Nobuharu and Yamagata Masakage heard the drums, and saw the braziers and open gates, they assumed that Tokugawa was planning a trap, and so they stopped and made camp for the night. The authenticity of this story has been disputed by some, however, as it appears to be copied straight from Zhuge Liang's story, perhaps in an attempt to embellish Tokugawa's career.

Synopsis Val√©rian and Laureline have brought their crippled astroship to a repair yard on the planet Rubanis. They are quoted a price of seven hundred thousand bloutoks for the repairs but have no money. They are approached by the three Shingouz who advise them to visit Colonel T'loc, the chief of police, who has a job for them. Taking a taxi cab, they are driven first through the anarchic traffic of the First Circle of the city, where they have left the astroship, and then into the Second Circle which is much less chaotic thanks to the floating mines that keep the traffic in check. From there, they proceed upwards to the orbital station where Colonel T'loc has his headquarters. With the taxi left waiting, they are brought to T'loc's office. The colonel tells them that he is concerned about trouble that is brewing in the Circles of Rubanis. The police force are too busy lining their own pockets to deal with the situation and so T'loc has turned to Val√©rian and Laureline to help him. He describes the five Circles of Rubanis: the First, dedicated to heavy industry; the Second, designated for business and the Third, dedicated to shopping and entertainment. The Fourth Circle is dedicated to the aristopatrons: the leaders of the religions, the public service and business. It is from this Circle that T'loc receives his orders via a machine in his office. No orders have been received for a long time. Val√©rian and Laureline ask to examine the machine but T'loc forbids it saying that to open the machine is to risk their lives. T'loc doesn't know where his orders come from and this troubles him. He wants Val√©rian and Laureline to investigate the Fifth and final Circle ‚Äì the Circle of Power, a Circle that no one enters and offers them seven hundred thousand bloutoks. Val√©rian and Laureline ask for expenses on top of what's offered but T'loc refuses. Val√©rian moves to open the machine and T'loc pulls his gun on him warning him that if the machine is opened the Scunindar virus will spread. T'loc relents and agrees to double their risk bonus and gives them an up front payment ‚Äì a Grumpy Transmuter from Bluxte, able to duplicate any currency it is fed. Given a contact name to start their investigations from T'loc's deputy, Indicator Croupachof, they ask their taxi driver to take them to the Third Circle. As they fly through the Second Circle, they are attacked by a woman driving a black limousine. The driver manages to evade her and she crashes her vehicle. Landing in the Third Circle, Val√©rian, Laureline and the taxi driver make their way to the bar where they are to meet their contact. Waiting for their contact, they find that the Shingouz are also in the bar ‚Äì it is their job to introduce the contact. The contact arrives and demands 100 Ebebe pearls for the information. Laureline puts the grumpy to work and the contact tells there is a way into the Fifth Circle through an old, abandoned entrance. Suddenly they are interrupted ‚Äì Na'Zultra, the woman in the limousine who attacked them, enters, accompanied by her henchmen and swinging a cretiniser whip. Val√©rian and the taxi driver duck under the table out of the influence of the whip but Laureline and the Shingouz are mesmerized. The contact tries to escape but is shot. The henchmen grab Laureline and make off with her. Val√©rian tries to follow but is too late. The taxi driver, who is called S'Traks, offers to help ‚Äì he thinks he can find Na'Zultra through the mechanics who will be sent from the Fourth Circle to recover her crashed limousine. Val√©rian and S'Traks return to where the wreck of the vehicle lies and hide themselves inside it. Just as S'Traks planned, the recovery vehicle arrives and takes them into the Fourth Circle. As they explore, a group of aristopatrons ‚Äì priests, high officials and businessmen ‚Äì come marching by. S'Traks is shocked by their appearance ‚Äì their necks have elongated and their heads have shrunk. Ambushing some stragglers, Val√©rian and S'Traks steal their clothes in order to disguise themselves and follow the crowd. Elsewhere, Na'Zultra is interrogating Laureline. Na'Zultra explains that she intends to seize power on Rubanis and demands the information that Laureline got from the contact. Laureline tells her that Na'Zultra had killed him before he could say anything. Unsatisfied with Laureline's answers, she reveals that she has a machine similar to the one in Colonel T'loc's office. Na'Zultra explains that the Scunindar virus affects the mind and orders her henchmen to strap Laureline into the machine. Before they can switch on another of Na'Zultra's men arrives to warn her that two intruders have been detected at an aristopatron meeting. Realising that it must be Val√©rian and S'Traks, Na'Zultra departs with her men leaving just one guard to look after Laureline who is still strapped into the machine. Left alone with the guard, Laureline offers to make him rich if he will release her. Intrigued, the guard undoes the straps and Laureline shows him the Grumpy Transmuter. The guard asks Laureline to get the Grumpy to transmute some Glods from Vlago-Vlago. While the guard is distracted watching the Grumpy going about making the Glods, Laureline sneaks up behind him and knocks him unconscious. Exploring the corridors of the Fourth Circle, searching for Val√©rian and the way out, Laureline finds a group of aristopatrons connected to a series of the machines that release the Scunindar virus. Moving on further she finds Val√©rian and S'Traks, pinned down by fire from Na'Zultra and her Vlago-Vlago mercenaries. Laureline manages to distract Na'Zultra for long enough to enable all three to make their escape using the recovery vehicle. Some time later, Val√©rian, Laureline and S'Traks ponder their next move. Laureline will try to find out more about the secret entrance to the Fifth Circle while Val√©rian will report back to T'loc on their progress and S'Traks will recruit a team to take on Na'Zultra's mercenaries. In the depths of the Third Circle, Laureline meets with the Shingouz again. She notices how entranced the population are by the screens that located all around the Circle. The Shingouz explain that they are another variation on the machines Laureline saw in the Fourth Circle. Laureline asks the Shingouz if they can find the ancient service entrance to the Circle of Power. They tell her of an old real estate salesman who lives in the Second Circle who may still have a set of plans for the Fifth Circle. Arriving at police headquarters, Val√©rian notices Croupachof's surprise at seeing him again and realises that it was he who warned Na'Zultra. Meeting with T'loc, Val√©rian asks why he has been sent on a useless mission since T'loc not only already knows that the aristopatrons have succumbed to the Scunindar virus but that he also has an antidote. Val√©rian points to the machine and asks to use it ‚Äì he will protect himself from the virus by using T'loc's antidote. Elsewhere, in the First Circle, S'Traks is assembling his army from the best pilots in the city. Arriving at an office in the Second Circle with the Shingouz, Laureline visits Dr. Zoump, the real estate salesman who may have a map of the Fifth Circle. Val√©rian, connected to the machine, is presented with a series of strange images including that of the mysterious Hyper-Prince. Switching off, Val√©rian asks T'loc if he is aware that they are putting together an expedition to go into the Circle of Power and find out who is transmitting the images. T'loc replies that he does and that he is also assembling a team of his own. They will move once the entrance has been located. T'loc gives Valerian the agreed fee of one million, seven hundred thousand bloutoks. As Val√©rian is picked up from T'loc's headquarters by S'Traks, he notices the large armada of police vehicles that T'loc is assembling. S'Traks replies that his team is even larger. In the Second Circle, Dr Zoump hands over the map in return for a fee. Leaving his office Laureline and the Shingouz just miss Na'Zultra and Croupachof who are also seeking the map. Val√©rian is reunited with Laureline and the Shingouz at the rendezvous point where the S'Traks' has assembled the team for the assault on the Circle of Power. They take off, closely monitored by both Na'Zultra and her mercenaries and T'loc and his police force. Finding the entrance, Val√©rian, Laureline and S'Traks punch their way in. All they find is a derelict room with automatic cameras transmitting the images of the Hyper- Prince and the Scunindar virus. Before the cameras lies the Hyper-Prince. Val√©rian, unaffected by the virus, snatches the ring from his finger and the Prince crumbles to dust, his ring of authority ‚Äì a viral sapphire from Scunindar ‚Äì no longer potent. At that moment both T'loc and Na'Zultra burst in. Fighting breaks out between S'Traks' men and T'loc and Na'Zultra's. Val√©rian, Laureline and the Shingouz make their escape as war breaks out all across Rubanis. Some time later, their astroship repaired and refitted, Valerian and Laureline depart Rubanis.

As in previous albums, the never-ending traffic congestion is a hallmark of the planet. Rubanis is composed of five distinct circles: * The First Circle. Where all of Rubanis' heavy industry is located. The most anarchic part of the planet. * The Second Circle. The business district. More regulated than the first circle. Floating mines keep the traffic in order. However, businessmen flinging themselves from their buildings when the stock exchange crashes can cause a hazard to traffic. * The Third Circle. Where merchants, amusements and arts congregate. * The Fourth Circle. Home to high priests, respected public officials and the business aristocracy. * The Fifth Circle. The mysterious circle of power.

Jean-Claude M√©zi√®res was contracted in 1991 to provide concept art for the film. He produced concepts for the futuristic New York, with its flying cars, as well as the Fhloston Paradise space-liner. When the production on the film was suspended in 1993, Besson turned to making the film L√©on and M√©zi√®res returned to Val√©rian where he reworked several of the concepts he had been working on into The Circles of Power -- most notably the flying taxi cabs. When the album was finished in 1994, M√©zi√®res sent a copy to Besson who was so taken with the cab-driving character of S'Traks that he rewrote the script of The Fifth Element, changing the occupation of protagonist Korben Dallas from a worker in a rocketship factory to cab driver.M√©zi√®res (2004), p. 65 The film resumed production in 1996 and was released in 1997. * The Circles of Power was translated into English by Timothy Ryan Smith and published, along with On the Frontiers and The Living Weapons in the same volume, in November 2004 by iBooks under the title Valerian: The New Future Trilogy.

All ten people on board were killed: six passengers, including three members of the Australian Cabinet and the Chief of the General Staff; and four crew. The aircraft is believed to have stalled on its landing approach, when it was too low to recover. The deaths of the three cabinet ministers severely weakened the United Australia Party government of Robert Menzies and contributed to its fall in 1941.Tink, Andrew \\"Air Disaster Canberra: the plane crash that destroyed a government \\". NewSouth Books. 1 April 2013, , Retrieved 17 April 2013 via boffinsbookshop.com.au Background A16-97, the aircraft involved in the crash, was part of a batch of 100 Lockheed Hudson bombers newly ordered for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It was received by the No. 1 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Laverton on 20 June 1940 and assigned to No. 2 Squadron. It was the first Hudson in the RAAF to be fitted out with passenger seating, to be reserved for transporting \\"essential maintenance stores and personnel to advanced operational bases\\", as well as ministerial traffic when required. On 9 August, the station administrative officer at RAAF Laverton received instructions to prepare a flight to Canberra on 13 August, to be reserved for Fairbairn, the air and civil aviation minister. The aircraft had 7 hours and 10 minutes of flying time, of which 2 hours and 35 minutes had been completed by Lockheed test pilots. A daily inspection was completing on the morning of the flight and signed off by the pilot Bob Hitchcock. At 8.47 a.m. he and three crew members left RAAF Laverton for Essendon Airport. James Fairbairn, the Minister for Air and Civil Aviation, had been working at his departmental headquarters in Melbourne and requested the flight in order to attend an important cabinet meeting on defence policy, which would discuss the allocation of Australian resources in the war. It had been called partially in response to a telegram from Winston Churchill to Menzies outlining his . The chiefs of staff of the army, navy and air force were also due to be in attendance. Fairbairn invited three other senior officials to join him on the flight ‚Äì Geoffrey Street, Minister for the Army; Henry Gullett, Minister for Information, and General Brudenell White, Chief of the General Staff. Fairbairn's private secretary Dick Elford and White's staff officer Frank Thornthwaite were the two other passengers. Two other ministers, George McLeay and Arthur Fadden, were also invited, but declined seats as they had already arranged to take the train. Prime Minister Robert Menzies' assistant private secretary Peter Looker had reserved two seats on the flight, but Menzies also preferred to take the train. Crash The Ministers and General White, with their staff, were being flown from Melbourne to Canberra for a Cabinet meeting. The aircraft, a RAAF Lockheed Hudson II bomber, was flown by an experienced Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) officer, Flight Lieutenant Robert Hitchcock. The aircraft, A16-97, had been in service with the RAAF since 20 June 1940, and was being operated by No.2 Squadron. The Perth Daily News reported: \\"The plane was seen by watchers at the Canberra Aerodrome and the Air Force station to circle the drome, and then rise and head south. It disappeared behind a low tree-dotted hill. There was an explosion and a sheet of flame, followed by a dense cloud of smoke... The Canberra Fire Brigade and ambulances from Canberra and Queanbeyan, across the border in New South Wales, as well as several Air Force tenders, arrived soon afterwards and fire extinguishers were played on the blazing wreckage. After about half-an-hour, when the blaze had died down, it was seen that the entire undercarriage, wings and structural supports of the plane had been torn away and were a smouldering mass in which were the charred bodies of those on board.\\" The plane came down in a paddock on \\"Dundee\\", a grazing property of owned by Duncan Cameron.

RAAF crew: *Flight Lieutenant Robert Edward Hitchcock *Pilot Officer Richard Frederick Wiesener *Corporal John Frederick Palmer *Aircraftman Charles Joseph Crosdale Cause The cause of the crash has always been a mystery although there has never been any suggestion of enemy action or sabotage. The crash took place at 10:15 a.m. in fine weather, in what the Melbourne Herald called \\"ideal flying conditions\\". James Fairbairn had served in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I and still enjoyed flying. It has always been suspected that he may have persuaded the RAAF crew to allow him to fly the plane into Canberra. A week before the accident, Fairbairn told an Adelaide headmaster, \\"Hudson bombers have a rather nasty stalling characteristic.... From what I have been told, a pilot coming in to land can find himself, suddenly and without warning, in a machine that is no longer airborne, heading straight to the ground.... Personally, I think it's only a matter of handling your throttles wisely\\".Andrew Tink (23 March 2013) \\"Fatal Flight\\". Sydney Morning Herald, accessed 19 May 2013 (Edited extract from Tink, \\"Air Disaster Canberra\\")The 1940 Canberra air disaster that changed history ‚Äî and the unanswered questions that remain ABC News, 4 September 2018. Retrieved 4 September 2018. More recently the RAAF Historian C. D. Coulthard-Clark, in his book The Third Brother, called into question the flying ability of the pilot-in-command, FLTLT Hitchcock. An account of his comments appears in the book Air Crash vol. 2 by noted Australian aviation writer Macarthur Job (Aerospace Publications, Canberra 1992). However, Andrew Tink, author of Air Disaster Canberra: the plane crash that destroyed a government (2013), was reported in 2018 as doubting whether Hitchcock had been at the controls at the time of the crash. Investigations The Court of Inquiry into the accident found that it was most likely from the aircraft stalling on its landing approach, resulting in loss of control at a height too low to recover. The aircraft crashed into a hill with great force, killing all occupants instantly, then burning fiercely. =Coronial inquest= A coronial inquest was conducted by John Goodwin, the chairman of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council and the territory's acting coroner. He had been a special magistrate since 1930 and was \\"experienced in coronial duties\\". Goodwin was assisted by Thomas Mills, a representative of the Crown Solicitor's Office. Mills advised Goodwin that his jurisdiction was limited to determining the identity of the victims and their cause of death. Goodwin's report, issued on 27 August, accepted the identification of the victims made by Duncan Mackellar, the medical superintendent of Canberra Hospital. Mackellar was a general practitioner with limited experience in forensic medicine, and faced difficulties in distinguishing between the victims' bodies which had been burned beyond recognition. The six civilian passengers were identified with the assistance of Street's private secretary Percy Hayter. Thornthwaite was identified by his personal belongings, White by his general's insignia, Street by a signet ring, and Gullett by his dentures; Fairbairn and Elford were identified by previous injuries. The four military passengers were identified with the assistance of Group Captain Douglas Wilson, who did not know them personally. Wilson used a process of elimination based on the victims' uniforms and positions within the plane. Based on Mackellar's evidence, Goodwin concluded \\"I am of the opinion that the men were killed before the plane was burnt\\". He determined that in each case the \\"immediate cause of death\\" was a fractured skull. Mackellar had attested that it would be \\"fairly safe to assume that all ten men were killed when the plane hit the ground\\". This conclusion contradicted initial newspaper reports that the victims had been killed by the post-crash fire. There is anecdotal evidence that at least one eyewitness believed there were still people alive after the crash. However, no evidence of that nature was brought before the inquest. =RAAF investigations= Being an RAAF flight, responsibility for the crash lay with the Department of Air rather than the Department of Civil Aviation and its Air Accident Investigation Committee. The RAAF's Inspectorate of Air Accidents, led by Arthur William Murphy with the assistance of Henry Winneke, submitted a report on 16 August which concluded that the immediate cause of the accident was a stall. It concluded that there was \\"no option but to attribute the stall to an error of judgment on the part of the pilot\\". The Air Board separately constituted a three-person Service Court of Inquiry led by Wing Commander Leon Lachal and assisted by Squadron Leader Frederick Stevens and Pilot Officer George Pape. Lachal's report went into more depth and consideration of technical detail, but reached the same conclusion, that the crash was \\"due to the aircraft stalling when approaching the aerodrome to land\\" and that \\"the accident was due to an error of judgment on the part of the pilot\\". The conclusion of the Murphy and Lachal reports was immediately disputed by the RAAF's Director of Training George Jones, who stated \\"I cannot believe that a pilot of Hitchcock's experience would stall the aircraft under the circumstances which apparently existed\\". =2020 Wooldridge revelation= On 12 August 2020, the day before the 80th anniversary of the crash, Michael Wooldridge, a former Minister of the Australian Government, wrote a revelatory story in The Australian. He recalled a discussion he had with Sir Harry White, Australia's first National Librarian, whose friend, Norman Tritton, Prime Minister Menzies' Private Secretary. Menzies sent Tritton to the crash site to find out the details. Tritton had told White that he had been allowed to the crash itself, and the body of Fairbairn was still strapped into the pilot's seat. Wooldridge discussed the matter with White early in his tenure as a politician, and said that White kept the secret for 50 years, and he did for another 30 years.Pilot of doomed RAAF bomber can finally be revealed - The biggest cover-up in Australian political history is finally revealed., Michael Wooldridge, The Australian, 2020-08-12 Effects Menzies was deeply affected by the crash, both personally and politically. \\"This was a dreadful calamity,\\" he told the House of Representatives the next day. \\"For my three colleagues were my close and loyal friends. Each of them had a place not only in the Cabinet but in my heart\\". Although Menzies was not in fact close to Fairbairn personally or politically, Street and Gullett were among his closest supporters, and Gullett was a trusted senior adviser. When Menzies attended a memorial gathering at the site on 12 August 1960, 20 years after the crash, he was seen to be still very emotional in recalling the day. In the wake of the loss of three senior Cabinet ministers, Menzies was forced to reshuffle his ministry. The Cabinet was permanently weakened by their loss, and that was a factor undermining Menzies's position in the following months. One of those promoted in the reshuffle was Harold Holt, recalled from Army service and thus gaining a promotion that eventually led to the Prime Ministership. As a general election was already due by the end of the year, it was felt prudent to call it for September, to avoid the necessity of also holding three by-elections for such a short term. At the election, Fairbairn's seat of Flinders and Street's seat of Corangamite were retained by the UAP, but Gullett's seat of Henty was lost to an independent, Arthur Coles, who was one of the two independents who voted to bring down the government in 1941 (then headed by the Country Party leader Arthur Fadden), allowing John Curtin of the Australian Labor Party to become Prime Minister. Legacy In 1953, the RAAF base at Canberra was renamed Fairbairn Airbase in Fairbairn's honour. Two of the ministers were later followed into federal politics by their sons, Jo Gullett and Tony Street. After the war, a memorial cairn was erected at the site.

It is the terminus of the Aberdare branch of the Merthyr Line, 22¬Ω miles (36 km) directly north of . Passenger services are provided by Transport for Wales.  Overview  Abercynon branch train at Aberdare (Low Level) in 1954 The station at this location (the former Aberdare High Level) was opened in 1851 and was served by the trains of the Vale of Neath, later Great Western Railway on their route between and Pontypool Road. The line from Abercynon and Cardiff had been built in 1846 by the Aberdare Railway Company (later absorbed by the Taff Vale Railway) - this ran to an adjacent but separate station at , although the two routes were later connected to each other a short distance to the west of the town at Gadlys Junction. Passenger rail services into the town on both lines fell victim to the Beeching Axe in 1964, with the last train running on the former VoN line on 13 JunePage, p.37 and over the ex-TVR line from Cardiff on 30 OctoberHolland, p.122 However part of the VoN line west of the town remained open for coal trains serving Tower Colliery at Hirwaun, which was then accessed by the former Taff Vale line. This was also retained to serve various collieries and a coking plant further down the valley at Abercwmboi. From 1968 though, this route was reduced to single track to reduce maintenance costs. Goods traffic through the ex-VoN High Level station ended in 1965 and the line fell into disuse, but in August 1973 it was reopened to release the former TVR line trackbed and station site for road improvements (including the removal of an inconveniently-located level crossing - the town bus station now occupies the site). All services were diverted onto the old VoN line via a new connection between the two lines near Cwmbach and then on through the old High Level station to regain their former route at Gadlys Junction. The new connection was carried over the River Cynon on a girder bridge that had previously been used to carry the defunct to branch line across the A40 road at Wheatley, Oxfordshire.Body, p.94 The fact that the line remained open made it possible to reinstate passenger services to the town, which started again under British Rail and Mid Glamorgan in October 1988 using a new platform close to the old disused one (the old High Level station building still survives and can be seen from the current station). Freight continued to run several times a day from the colliery over track owned by it, until Tower Colliery's final closure on 18 January 2008. EWS still ran trains to the Tower washery on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday for some time afterwards to clear coal stocks from the site. These departed Aberdare at 7:00 pm on Wednesdays and 11:30 am on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, these trains were hauled by occasional Class 60s but a high proportion of these services were Class 66 hauled. Freightliner also operate stone trains to Tower but this service varies, these trains are usually hauled by a Class 66 diesel locomotive. Announced in November 2009 the Welsh Assembly Government has asked Network Rail to conduct a feasibility study on reopening the line to Hirwaun for passenger services. Network Rail is expected to clear the line of vegetation and assess the track bed before publishing its report in 2010, before any business cases to reopen the line is then developed.\\"Old tracks could see trains again\\"BBC News article 6 November 2009 It was announced in March 2011 that the Welsh Assembly Government's 2011-12 capital programme would include the re-opening of the line to Hirwaun as part of the Cynon Valley Scheme.\\"Aberdare-to-Hirwaun rail line set to reopen\\"Wales Online news article 21 March 2011 However, there is currently no information on when the work will commence. Facilities View shortly after reopening (2004) Along with other stations on the Merthyr Line, Aberdare has undergone construction work to lengthen the platform. This now allows four-car trains to stop at the station. The platform also has a staffed ticket counter, which is open six days per week from early morning until mid-afternoon. Train running information is offered via CIS displays, a help point and timetable posters. Car parking is provided at the station. The high level station building is being restored to become a bistro cafe for students, staff and the public, as part of the new Coleg y Cymoedd campus.\\"Plans submitted to build new ¬£20m college campus in heart of Aberdare\\"Wales Online news article 11 December 2013 Services On Mondays to Saturday daytimes, the service from Aberdare is a half-hourly service to Barry Island, via . In the evenings this drops to hourly and certain late night trains run to rather than Barry Island. Services are formed of Class 142 and Class 143 Pacer units and Class 150 Sprinter units. On Sundays there is a general 2-hourly service to Barry Island with an hourly service in the morning and in the late afternoon. This is due to a campaign by the local Assembly Member and a successful trial in December 2017. The extra services began in April 2018. There is a dedicated rail linc bus that links with the train. It is only available to rail passengers and operates to Penywaun, Hirwaun, Cefn Rhigos and Rhigos. The rail link bus no longer operates, but rail linc tickets are valid for use on Stagecoach buses that serve the aforementioned communities; planning is also in place to open a new railway station at Hirwaun.

Settings * A luxury hotel on an unnamed yellow and orange coloured planet where Val√©rian and Laureline are spending their vacation. They have also been brought on excursions to: ** Kokok'Um. To see the underwater colonnades. ** Tak. To see the crystalloid formations which remind Laureline of the asteroid belt surrounding Alflolol. ** An unnamed planet to watch the primitive wildlife. * Point Central, the vast space station where all the races of the cosmos meet, previously seen in Ambassador of the Shadows and On the Frontiers. Point Central is made up of many different segments: ** Earth's segment, ruined and crumbling just like it was in On the Frontiers. Its sole occupant remains Jal. ** A service astroport on the dark side of Point Central used by several races. It is from here that the Mortis Quartet transfer their prisoners to the stellar barge that takes them to Iksaladam. ** The Caliph addresses the assembled dignitaries in the vast Hall of Screens, the meeting place for Point Central's council. ** Laureline's Tchoung-tracer passes through several segments of Point Central previously seen in Ambassador of the Shadows and On the Frontiers while searching for Val√©rian: *** The endless corridors and passageways that connect the segments maintained by the mute Zools. *** The Groubos and their Zuur pilots. *** The warlike Kamuniks. *** The Marmakas. *** The Pulpissim's market. * Iksaladam, the area of the cosmos richest in the valuable Ultralum fuel needed to power the spatio-temporal engines of most races' spaceships. The high concentration of Ultralum causes frequent distortions in the local fabric of space-time and, as a result, the entire region is a shambles of planets, asteroids, comets, debris and dust. The only people capable of navigating it are the old space dogs that carry the Ultralum fuel in their barges and the Caliph's navy who have highly sophisticated tracking and detection equipment. Iksaladam is ruled by its Caliph, descended from the prophet, one of the richest men in the cosmos, who rules from his vast palace on the central planet in the Iksaladam system. The Ultralum is mined by the Extralums (short for Extractors of Ultralum) who use mobile extraction wells which are capable of adapting to the spatio-temporal instability of the region. Nevertheless, Ultralum mining is highly hazardous and accidents are very common.

The projects had emerged from design studies which had been aimed at competing first with the Boeing 727-200 and then with the proposed European Airbus. During the 1960s, BAC, having become interested in the prospects for developing successors to its existing airliners, such as the Vickers VC10, embarked upon a series of studies, initially centering on an enlarged double-decker version of the VC10, commonly referred to as the Super VC10. After this concept failed to gain favour and the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) selected the American Boeing 747 instead, the company decided to refocus its efforts on a smaller aircraft partially based upon its successful One-Eleven airliner instead. The resulting proposed 191 to 208-seat airliner, known as the Two-Eleven, was viewed as an alternative to the multinational collaborative effort with other European nations to produce an airliner, referred to then as an Airbus. However, the Two-Eleven study ultimately failed to attract much attention within the industry while the British government favoured the cooperative Airbus initiative and thus was shelved in 1968. Following the British decision to withdraw from the Airbus programme in 1969, BAC quickly revisited its designs for the Two-Eleven and refreshed them to produce an updated proposal, known as the Three-Eleven. It was a widebody airliner, in a similar class in terms of size, weight, and range, to the original Airbus design. During August 1970, BEA's chairman, Sir Anthony Milward, publicly declared his optimism for the Three-Eleven programme. Spurred on, during November 1969, BAC approached the Ministry of Technology, seeing to acquire financial support for the Three-Eleven programme. However, support was not forthcoming for several reasons, chiefly the foreign policy implications of competing head to head with the Airbus and thus Britain's own European partners, as well as the tendency of previous British airliners to be uncompetitive and to incur higher than predicted development costs. On 2 December 1970, Frederick Corfield, the Minister for Aviation Supply, announced in the House of Commons that there would be no official backing from the government for the Three-Eleven. BAC quietly shelved its plans for the type during the following year. Development =Two- Eleven= During the 1960s, there was considered interest in the development of a new generation of airliners to replace those of the first generation, such as the British de Havilland Comet and Bristol Britannia, the French Sud Aviation Caravelle and the American Boeing 707, amongst European aircraft manufacturers. In Britain, the British Aircraft Company (BAC) was no exception, showing significant interest in the requirements of both civil and military operators, to which it considered various measures and approaches to respond with.Wood 1975, pp. 225-235. During 1964, both BAC and its principal domestic rival, Hawker Siddeley, conducted detailed studies on the prospects of producing stretched versions of their existing airliners, the Vickers VC10 and the Hawker Siddeley Trident.Wood 1975, p. 233. In the first half of the following year, BAC submitted its proposals for the production of two separate double-decker versions of the VC10, which was commonly referred to as the Super VC10; however, it was quickly recognised that the British government would be required substantial support for the initiative to succeed, involving \\"several tens of millions of pounds\\".Wood 1975, pp. 233-234. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the enlarged double-decker, which was to be equipped with the proposed Rolls-Royce RB178 turbofan engine, would have had good commercial prospects, yet financing for the programme was not forthcoming and the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) has ultimately opted to procure the rival Boeing 747 instead.Wood 1975, p. 234. While the Super VC10 proposal was being studied, other alternatives were also being examined by BAC, BOAC, and the British government. The idea of European cooperation had become increasingly palatable from a political standpoint; the British government was keen to pursue some of the joint development opportunities being promoted, including that of a 'European Airbus'. Observing the interest being expressed in the Airbus concept, BAC decided to prepare its own alternative proposals for a similar airliner, this time basing it around the smaller and more successful BAC One-Eleven regional jet. Accordingly, during 1966, BAC formally issued their latest proposal for a new airliner in the form of the Two-Eleven. It was a 191 to 208-seat airliner, being sized relatively similarly to the existing American Boeing 727-200, while resembling the basic configuration of the future McDonnell Douglas MD-80 in terms of its size and layout. As proposed, the Two-Eleven would have been powered by a pair of the in-development Rolls-Royce RB211 high-bypass turbofan engines, rate of 30,000 lb each. Reportedly, to proceed with development of the Two-Eleven would have required an estimated ¬£50 million. According to Wood, the proposal attracted the support of British European Airways, but not of the British government, which by this time was already favouring the option presented by Airbus and lacked the resources to fund multiple competing efforts at the same time. BAC sought to improve the Two-Eleven to increase its attractiveness to operators, hoping to garner greater support from the industry. As such, by August 1967, the company was stating the tenative airliner to now be provided with superior airfield performance via the availability of greater thrust, which had been increased by 20 per cent over the initial design.Wood 1975, pp. 234-235. The study ultimately failed to attract much attention; consequently, by 1968, the proposal had been shelved with little fanfare. =Three-Eleven= During 1968, the British government decided to back out of the Airbus venture, citing a belief in its poor prospects in terms of both its economics and market.p. 235. BAC was speculated to have welcomed such news and seen it as encouraging, not being part of the European Airbus programme (as distinct from rival Hawker Siddeley) and having little airliner work for the future as the One-Eleven project wound down. Perhaps sensing this event as an opportunity, BAC decided to revisit its designs for the Two-Eleven and to extensively refresh them, resulting in its proposal for the Three-Eleven.Wood 1975, p. 236. The Three- Eleven was publicly introduced at the 1967 and 1969 Paris Air Shows. It was a widebody airliner, in a similar class in terms of size, weight, and range, to the original and somewhat smaller European Airbus which was then in the early stages of development. At the time, the Three-Eleven was widely assumed to have emerged with encouragement from some British government circles and individuals that were close to Rolls-Royce, who were anxious to have a fall- back option in case the European Airbus failed. As presented in drawings, artists' impressions, models, and a partial timber mock-up, the Three-Eleven, resembled a One-Eleven which had been doubled in size. According to Wood, as proposed, the Three-Eleven was to be furnished with twin RB.211 engines, rated at 43,000 lb of thrust (later raised to 50,000 lb); these would have been mounted near the rear of the airliner, fixed to either side of the tail cone beneath a T-formation empennage. Possessing a take-off weight of 267,000 lb (which was subsequently revised upwards to 302,000 lb), the airliner could accommodate up to 245 passengers seated in an eight abreast configuration at a 34-inch pitch (or up to 300 passengers at a 30-inch pitch). Such a payload could be carried across a distance of at least 1,500 nm. During November 1969, BAC approached the Ministry of Technology, seeing to acquire financial support for the Three-Eleven programme. In its application, the company claimed that it had an established order book for between 40 and 50 options to procure the tentative airliner, while the development costs were estimated to be ¬£140 million, half of which was being sought from the British government. BAC forecast the Three-Eleven to receive type certification during late 1974. The company had high hopes of receiving support as the Minister of Technology, the Labour politician Tony Benn, was known to be sympathetic toward the Three- Eleven. While the government deliberated on its response to BAC's submission, the company decided to expend ¬£4 million of its own money on the programme in order to continue to refine its proposal. =Lack of support and abandonment= In order to proceed, the Three-Eleven programme would have required what was commonly termed at the time as \\"government launch aid.\\" Following its withdrawal from the Airbus venture, the British government was theoretically free to support the Three-Eleven. During 1969 and 1970, the British government-owned airline British European Airways (BEA) expressed willingness to operate the proposed airliner and its preference for the type over the rival Airbus proposal. During August 1970, BEA's chairman, Sir Anthony Milward, publicly declared his optimism for the Three-Eleven, noting that, unless the airliner was ordered, BEA would be forced to spend ¬£180 million procuring foreign-built airliners to satisfy its needs instead. In addition to BEA, several other airlines declared their support for the Three- Eleven proposal, such as the privately owned Court Line Aviation airline (however, the operator had also declared itself to be equally willing to operate the European Airbus). No orders were placed: the design had not been finalised and the programme itself has not been actually launched. By this stage, the Three-Eleven had become involved in several controversies: * The foremost controversy addressed the Three-Eleven's technical aspects, with claims that, inherent to the design's aerodynamic properties, it would be prone to encountered the deep stall phenomenon, along with other unfavourable conditions, such as loadability and centre of gravity issues when used in real-life airline service, as well as there being a high likelihood of the type being overweight. It was suggested that the aeroplane would make a poor freight and mixed passenger/freight carrier due to configurational shortcomings. (Indeed, the layout failed to make its way into production on any widebody aircraft, the Ilyushin Il-86 project reverting to a conventional layout before it reached the hardware stage.); * Another controversy addressed Britain's foreign policy and was double-sided. On the one hand, in nascent complaints at European governments' finance for aircraft which competed with American products, private US aircraft makers cautioned that such support may ultimately impact trade and political relations across the Atlantic. On the other, Britain's potential Common Market partners warned that since the Three- Eleven project would directly compete against the European Airbus, around which they had largely coalesced; according, to proceed with the programme effectively threw doubt over British loyalty to the EEC which, at this point, the British government had submitted an application to become a member of. * A third controversy addressed the British government's backing for its aviation industry. Specifically, there were concerned claims that several of the airliner projects which had been sponsored by the government had tended to be uncompetitive, furthermore, in some cases, the aircraft had been unwanted by the airlines whose needs they purported to meet. In particular, it was claimed that Vickers VC10 and Trident experience showed that initial finance was understated deliberately so as to entice backing from the government, which would effective lock it into providing further support later as and when the need for additional financing became apparent. Specifically, rival Hawker Siddeley had publicly scorned BAC's development cost figures for the Three- Eleven, rubbishing them as have been understated and making its own suggestions of much higher figures to be likely. Considerations of these multiple issues were a factor in the delaying of any government launch aid. Since a general election was approaching, the Labour cabinet of Harold Wilson had decided to halt any progress on the issue until a new government with a fresh mandate had been elected to power. The election resulted in a Conservative government. As opposed to Labour, this party was enthusiastically intent on taking Britain into the EEC; the party was also ideologically opposed to state intervention in industry. In short order, however, the new Edward Heath cabinet had to involve itself in such an intervention in order to rescue Rolls-Royce from bankruptcy, resulting in the firm's nationalising. Since launch aid for the Three-Eleven would have been a further very significant instance of state intervention, and would also have given an anti- EEC signal, it was quietly omitted from the political agenda. By that time, the Airbus A300 design had been finalised and had attracted modest but sufficient orders, while the first A300 aeroplane was progressing to completion. There was also growing pressure from the Heath government for BEA and private British airlines (particularly Court Line) to buy another airliner, the American Lockheed L-1011 TriStar: since TriStars were powered by Rolls-Royce engines, this would help recovery in a sector of the British aviation industry which had recently attracted large state support. Wood speculated that, if the British government had provided financial backing for the Three-Eleven, the consequential investment by BAC in Rolls-Royce via the RB.211 engine would have been a considerable boon to the ailing firm, and may have potentially averted Rolls-Royce's bankruptcy entirely, but he also notes that this is conjecture on his own part. On 2 December 1970, Frederick Corfield, the Minister for Aviation Supply, announced in the House of Commons that there would be no official backing from the government for the Three- Eleven programme. This was effectively the death knell for the initiative, as other parties that potentially could have been interested were dissuaded by the government's decision to turn its back on the Three-Eleven. In the circumstances that BAC found itself in, few sales could be foreseen for the Three-Eleven, simultaneously, it was also apparent that there were no commercial sources which were likely to fund its development. By 1971, BAC had decided to quietly abandon the Three-Eleven venture.

Booty played briefly in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a third baseman, and also in the National Football League (NFL) as a quarterback. High school (1990‚Äì1994) Booty went to Evangel Christian Academy in Shreveport, Louisiana. Josh's father Johnny was an All-American high school football player as well at Shreveport's Woodlawn High School (which produced NFL quarterbacks Terry Bradshaw and Joe Ferguson in the 1960s), and was the athletic director at Evangel Christian. He was also one of the founders of the Evangel school that turned into a football factory. Booty was named to the All-Time National High School All-American team by Dick Butkus. Joe Namath, and John Elway were the other two QB's mentioned on the All-Time team. As quarterback for the football team, he threw for 11,700 yards and 126 touchdowns, becoming the first high school player in history to throw for more than 10,000 yards (despite missing the last four games of his senior year because of a broken hand). Booty was named the USA Today Offensive Player of the Year and was named the National High School Player of the Year by at least six associations, including Parade and the Football News. Evangel won the Louisiana High School Athletic Association Class 1A state championship in 1993, the first of 11 the Eagles would win between 1993 and 2006. Booty's main competition for the 1993 awards was Peyton Manning, who was then a senior at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. As a shortstop for the baseball team, he was a four-time All-State choice at shortstop. As a senior, he batted .429 with 20 intentional walks, 25 stolen bases, and 12 home runs in 70 at bats. He was the starting shortstop for the U.S. Junior Olympic National Team that won the silver medal. He was a USA Today All-American shortstop. Booty won a silver medal in the 1993 U.S. Olympic Festival. He was the 5th pick overall in the 1994 Major League Baseball Draft by the Florida Marlins. Highly recruited by major college football programs from across the country, Booty decided to sign with the Marlins for a then-record $1.6 million signing bonus. Baseball career (1994‚Äì1998) Booty was the fifth pick overall in the first round of the Major League Baseball Amateur Draft (1994). Booty spent five years in the Marlins organization, and was a career .269 hitter in the major leagues. The Marlins reportedly paid him $1.6 million, a then draft signing bonus record, if he did not play football in the duration of his contract, but decided to pursue a career in pro football. He hit 20-plus home runs in single and double A minor league stops and was voted the Minor League Defensive Player of the Year in 1997 for the Portland Sea Dogs. He hit .198 in his minor league career. In 2013, Booty spent spring training in Arizona with the Arizona Diamondbacks as a knuckleball pitcher after winning MLB Network's reality show The Next Knuckler. College football career (1999‚Äì2000) In 1999, Booty went to Louisiana State University (LSU) to play football for LSU's football team. He signed with LSU in February 1994 to play football for then-coach Curley Hallman, but instead signed a baseball contract. During two years there, he completed 49.3% of his passes for 3,951 yards and 24 touchdowns. =Freshman season= Booty beat out two future NFL draft picks Craig Nall and Rohan Davey for the starting job. The Tigers did not have much success, and Head Coach Gerry DiNardo was fired during the season. =Sophomore season= During his sophomore season (2000), under Coach Nick Saban, Booty started the first four games of the season. In LSU's 58‚Äì0 victory over Western Carolina he completed 80.0% of his passes for 291 yards, throwing two touchdowns and no interceptions. In LSU's 28‚Äì13 victory over Houston he completed 44.0% of his passes for 175 yards, throwing two touchdowns and two interceptions. In LSU's 34-17 loss to No. 24 Auburn he completed 44.8% of his passes for 214 yards, throwing two touchdowns and one interception. In LSU's 13-10 loss to UAB he completed 39.5% of his passes for 156 yards. He threw an interception along the left sideline on what turned out to be the Tigers' final offensive play of the game, turning the ball over to the Blazers in field goal range. UAB won on a 32-yard Rhett Gallego field goal with no time left. Booty did not play in next game against No. 11 Tennessee because of a rib injury. Davey quarterbacked a 38‚Äì31 overtime victory over Tennessee in Tiger Stadium. Davey only completed 33.3% of his passes against Florida, throwing no touchdowns and one interception, so Booty took over with 10:32 left in the third quarter while the score was Florida 24, LSU 3. Booty finished the game, completing 62.5% of his passes for 184 yards, throwing one touchdown. The final score was Florida 41, LSU 9. Booty was starting quarterback for the rest of the season: *LSU's 34‚Äì0 victory over Kentucky (completing 45.5% of his passes for 225 yards, throwing three touchdowns and no interceptions) *LSU's 45‚Äì38 OT victory over #13 Mississippi State (completing 63.2% of his passes for 246 yards, throwing two touchdowns, and one interception) *LSU's 30‚Äì28 victory over Alabama (completing 58.1% of his passes for 275 yards, throwing for four touchdowns and no interceptions). This competition is known as the \\"It's About Time\\" game because it was the first time in 31 years that LSU had defeated Alabama at home.Chet Hilburn, The Mystique of Tiger Stadium: 25 Greatest Games: The Ascension of LSU Football (Bloomington, Indiana: WestBow Press, 2012), p. 47 *LSU's 20‚Äì9 victory at Ole Miss (completing 53.3% of his passes for 290 yards, throwing one touchdown and no interceptions) *LSU's 14-3 loss to Arkansas (completing 22.2% of his passes for 65 yards, throwing no touchdowns and two interceptions) in pouring rain and windy conditions During Booty's nine games as a starter, LSU went 6‚Äì3, as Booty threw 17 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. Booty finished his sophomore season throwing for 2,121 yards, which at the time was the third-best performance by a sophomore in LSU history, behind Jeff Wickersham's 1983 sophomore season (2,542 yards) and Tommy Hodson's 1987 sophomore season (2,125 yards). Booty was voted to the first team All-SEC Team, becoming the first LSU quarterback to be awarded that honor since Tommy Hodson. At the end of the 2000 season, LSU went to the Peach Bowl and posted a 28‚Äì14 victory over No. 15 Georgia Tech. Booty played the first half and completed 42.1% of his passes for no touchdowns and no interceptions. Trailing 14-3 at halftime, Saban yanked Booty and inserted Davey, who helped LSU outscore the Yellow Jackets 25-0 in the second half. Professional football career Booty was taken as the 177th pick (6th round) of the 2001 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks. Personal life One of Booty's younger brothers, Abram, was a wide receiver at LSU (1997‚Äì1999), Valdosta State University (2000) and a Cleveland Browns wide receiver in 2001. Another brother, John David, was the starting quarterback at USC in 2007, and was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in 2008. John David quarterbacked USC's victories over Michigan and Illinois in the 2007 and 2008 Rose Bowls, respectively. He was formerly the spokesperson for TrueMRI in Beverly Hills, California, and has been involved with numerous radio and television commentating work in sports, including Sirius, Fox Sports, ESPN Radio. Josh won the MLB Network reality show \\"The Next Knuckler\\", hosted by former Boston Red Sox players Tim Wakefield and Kevin Millar. The show also included football players Doug Flutie, John David Booty, David Greene, and Ryan Perrilloux. For winning, he got a chance to go to spring training with the Arizona Diamondbacks as a pitcher, even though his baseball rights technically still belonged to the Marlins.Marlins hold rights to reality winner He struggled with his command while pitching in minor league spring training games and was released on March 28.Former LSU QB Josh Booty, who won TV contest to pitch, released by Diamondbacks References External links 1975 births Living people Players of American football from Louisiana Players of American football from Mississippi Evangel Christian Academy players LSU Tigers football players Cleveland Browns players Florida Marlins players Baseball players from Mississippi Major League Baseball third basemen Gulf Coast Marlins players Elmira Pioneers players Kane County Cougars players Portland Sea Dogs players Charlotte Knights players Sportspeople from Starkville, Mississippi Seattle Seahawks players Oakland Raiders players ","title":"Josh Booty"},{"id":"3516702","text":"\\"The Fisherman and His Wife\\" (German: Von dem Fischer un syner Fru) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm in 1812 (KHM 19). The tale is of Aarne‚ÄìThompson type 555, about dissatisfaction and greed. It may be classified as an anti-fairy tale.The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: A-F, article \\"Anti-fairy tale\\", p. 50  Origin  The tale was published by the Brothers Grimm in the first edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen in 1812 as tale no. 19. Their source was the German painter Philipp Otto Runge (1777‚Äì1810), from whom the Grimms obtained a manuscript of the tale in 1809. Johann Gustav B√ºsching published another version of Runge's manuscript a few months earlier in 1812 in Volkssagen, M√§rchen und Legenden, with some discrepancies with Grimm's version. Synopsis Anne Anderson290x290px There is a poor fisherman who lives with his wife in a hovel by the sea. One day the fisherman catches a fish, which claims to be an enchanted prince and begs to be set free. The fisherman kindly releases it. When his wife hears the story, she says he ought to have had the fish grant him a wish. She insists that he go back and ask the flounder to grant her wish for a nice house. The fisherman returns to the shore but is uneasy when he finds that the sea seems to become turbid, as it was so clear before. He makes up a rhyme to summon the flounder, and it grants the wife's wish. The fisherman is pleased with his new wealth, but the wife is not and demands more, and demands that her husband go back and wish that he be made a king. Reluctantly, he does and gets his wish. But again and again, his wife sends him back to ask for more and more. The fisherman knows this is wrong but there is no reasoning with his wife. He says they should not annoy the flounder, and be content with what they have been given, but his wife is not content. Each time, the flounder grants the wishes with the words: \\"just go home again, she has it already\\" or similar, but each time the sea grows more and more fierce. Eventually, the wife wishes to command the sun, moon, and heavens, and she sends her husband to the flounder with the wish \\"I want to become equal to God\\". When that final wish is made, the flounder says: \\"just go home again, she is already sitting in the old hovel again\\". And with that, the sea becomes calm once more.  Variants  The \\"Fisherman and His Wife\\" is similar to other AT-555 tales such as the German \\"Hanns Dudeldee\\", the Russian \\"The Old Man, His Wife, and the Fish\\", the Japanese \\"The Stonecutter\\", and the Indian \\"The Bullock's Balls\\".  Cultural legacy  Its theme was used in The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish, an 1833 poem by Aleksandr Pushkin. Virginia Woolf has her character Mrs. Ramsey in To the Lighthouse read a version of the story to her son, James. G√ºnter Grass's 1977 novel, The Flounder, is loosely based on the fairy tale, as are Emanuele Luzzati's version, Punch and the Magic Fish, and Ursula LeGuin's novel The Lathe of Heaven. The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish by Alexander Pushkin is based on this tale. In 1977 the German writer G√ºnter Grass published the novel, The Flounder (German: \\"Der Butt\\"), which is loosely based on this fairy tale. That same year, an animated adaptation with Hans Conreid and June Foray was released for Oscar consideration. A short cartoon based on this story was part of the United States animated television series, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. The Flounder was replaced by a beautiful mermaid who grants the wishes in exchange for her freedom. Additionally, the wife goes directly from queen to wishing to be a 'goddess'. The mermaid points out to the fisherman that all his wishes have been for his wife, and asks him what he desires. The fisherman replies that he just wants his wife to be happy, and the mermaid replies, \\"Go; she is happy.\\" As in the later 1997 version, the fisherman and his wife are reduced to living in their hovel, but the wife is happy that it is poor yet neat. In 1997, the story was given a Spanish-flavored adaptation on the animated cable series, Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child. Edward James Olmos and Julia Migenes provided the voices of the fisherman and his wife. In this version, the fisherman is unable to figure out what his last wish is, and says, \\"I want only for my wife to be happy\\". Immediately, he and his wife are reduced to living in the hovel again. She is content and happily embraces him. The Timon and Pumbaa cartoon episode \\"Be More Pacific\\" is based on this story, with Pumbaa's role paralleling the fisherman's and Timon's role paralleling the wife's. Pumbaa finds and rescues a magical whale named Lester, who grants him three wishes. Pumbaa asks for nothing for himself, but he does relay Timon's wishes to Lester. First Timon wishes for \\"something big and expensive\\" and is given the Statue of Liberty. Then he wishes to be a king and is transformed into a giant. Lastly he wishes to be \\"a regular-sized king in a stone castle with a ferocious fire-breathing monster that he can defeat,\\" but Pumbaa gets the message wrong and says \\"can't\\" instead of \\"can.\\" The ferocious monster turns out to be a fire-breathing chicken (instead of the dragon that Timon actually meant), and after several futile attempts to defeat and escape it, the episode ends with Timon searching for another wish-granting fish while Pumbaa struggles to hold down the trapdoor separating them from the monster.

The asteroids are clustered close to a sun that provides warmth and are close enough together to trap a breathable atmosphere enabling inhabitants to travel between the asteroids without extensive life support equipment. We see many parts of the Asteroids in this album including: * The hangars at the unfashionable end of Shimballil where Val√©rian and Laureline park their astroship and where the pouzzouf delivery business that Gl√º works for is located. * Ty Ko√ºn IV's personal asteroid which contains his luxury home and grounds that include a lake and forest. * Zakitab-The-Great-Market, where the population of Shimballil converge to trade their wares. * The Free University of Shimballil. Each floor has a Department assigned to it. When a new Department is created a new floor is added. It is connected to the rest of the asteroids via a regular shuttle service and is supplied constantly by automated delivery trucks. The subjects it offers include: ** Antimatter Lifeforms ** Theological Biology ** Poetry ** Interplantary Commercial Law ** Pedagogy * The Cyberkinomax Studios including Mindmax Studios, Mega Kolossus Studios and Ty Ko√ºn IV Paradise Studios. They are very similar to movie studios with sound stages, actors, wardrobe, make-up etc. Each kinosaga episode is written and filmed once the market surveys are in and are tailored accordingly. Two days after distribution each episode is junked. * The Diplomatic Quarter which is made up of impressive buildings protected by geostatic domes. Located in this quarter is the Star College which is modelled on the English public school Eton College right down to the uniforms. Its headmistress is the formidable Karl√§-Varl√§. Notes The Asteroids of Shimballil was originally the title of a proposed animated Val√©rian project in the early 1980s and the location was reused for this album. The Great Market at Zakitab is used in both stories. However, in The Asteroids of Shimballil, Shimballil is more primitive and the inhabitants have not discovered space travel. Orphan of the Stars appears to be set many years later ‚Äì Shimballil has been colonised by the wealthiest denizens of the galaxy who have brought their sophisticated technology with them. The concept art and plot outline for The Asteroids of Shimballil were published as an appendix to the album release of Bad Dreams. 1998 graphic novels Val√©rian and Laureline ","title":"Orphan of the Stars"},{"id":"3516713","title":"Chad at the 1996 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"3516718","text":"Chad competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.

It is a burrowing scorpion which spends a lot of time digging in the sand and enlarging its burrow. A similar species is the giant desert hairy scorpion. Captive care Hadrurus spadix can be housed in a big vivarium. A mixture of peat and sand should be used for substrate, though sand should be the major component. The substrate should be humidified in order to stabilize it and permit burrowing, then dried before introducing the scorpion in the vivarium. A rock or a piece of bark should be provided so the scorpion can dig its burrow under it. No water is needed in the vivarium and humidity should be quite low (30%) to prevent mycosis. Hadrurus spadix requires high temperatures, and do best at 30 ¬∞C‚Äì35 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F‚Äì95 ¬∞F) during the day, with a sharp drop in temperatures (to 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F)) during the night to mimic desert conditions. As with all scorpions, this species can be fed most types of small insects, though crickets remain the most common choice. Behavior Commonly known as the black-back scorpion, it can be differentiated from the giant desert hairy scorpion by its completely black prosoma or cephalothorax. This scorpion is quite nervous and can display aggressiveness towards its keeper. It should not be kept communally, as fights and cannibalism are frequent. The toxicity of its venom is usually deemed to be low, though its sting can be quite painful. This scorpion and its close relative Hadrurus arizonensis make good pets for a beginner, as they are quite large, very active and typically eat a lot.

Now he has to intervene with a situation that has arisen on Earth. Paris, 2001. The board of the multinational company Vivaxis are meeting to discuss their corporate rebranding. Suddenly, the Father of Hypsis manifests himself as a disembodied voice. He warns them against experimenting with human nature. The Spirit of Hypsis reads out the terms of a contract between God and Vivaxis. In the industrial depths of Point Central, Sat, a member of a species exiled by Hypsis, meets with the twin-detectives Frankie and Harry. They inform him of Hypsis' intervention on Earth and suggest that he travels with them to deal with the situation personally. Back on Earth, the Father's rage has got too much for him and the top of the Vivaxis building has collapsed. The board are forced to evacuate before the Spirit can complete reading the contract. On Point Central, the Shingouz observe Sat leaving with the twin-detectives. The travel to the orbiting living satellite, Belorb where they communicate with Val√©rian and Laureline warning them that Hypsis have intervened in Paris and that another agent, Sat, a fallen archangel of Hypsis and the devil of human mythology, is also involved. Val√©rian and Laureline travel to Earth and contact Mr Albert. He tells them of the mysterious explosion that has occurred in Vivaxis' tower in La D√©fence. He receives a message by carrier pigeon from a friend of his, Professor Petzold, who is director of worldwide research for Vivaxis. His message warns that Vivaxis is involved in research into human nature that would lead to eternal life through genetic manipulation and psychic conditioning. The research is being conducted at two centres ‚Äì one in Romania and one in South Africa. Val√©rian and Laureline decide to split up in order to investigate each centre. Sat arrives in Paris with Frankie and Harry. They take him to meet Master Mercury, an investment manager. Sat asks Mercury for his help in taking over Vivaxis.

As the attendees flee the auditorium, the Father and Sat square up to one another. Val√©rian interrupts bringing Schroeder and the first specimen of Vivaxis' research. The Father is not impressed with their work. Master Mercury reveals that Sat now holds the controlling stake in Vivaxis having taken advantage of the plunge in their share value.

Tsarevets is above sea level.Tsarevets Altitude and Location It served as the Second Bulgarian Empire's primary fortress and strongest bulwark between 1185 and 1393, housing the royal and the patriarchal palaces, and it is also a popular tourist attraction. History Veliko Tarnovo - Tsarevets Ruins of the Palace The earliest evidence of human presence on the hill dates from the 2nd millennium BC. It was settled in the 4th century and a Byzantine city, tentatively identified with Zikideva, was constructed near the end of the 5th century, on the grounds of which the construction of the Bulgarian stronghold was begun in the 12th century. After the Vlach-Bulgarian Rebellion and the establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire with its capital in Veliko Tarnovo, the fortress became the most important one in Bulgaria, often compared with Rome and Constantinople in magnificence. In 1393, the stronghold was besieged by Ottoman forces for three months before finally being conquered and burnt down on 17 July, which marked the fall of the Bulgarian Empire. It has three entrances. The main entrance is located in the easternmost side of the hill. The castle complex is located in the centre, surrounded by an internal stone wall, two battle towers and two entrances - north and south. It consists of a throne hall, castle church and the king's chamber. The restoration of the fortress Tsarevets began in 1930 and was completed in 1981 in honour of the 1300 anniversary from the establishment of the Bulgarian state. Kings Petar, Asen, Kaloyan and Ivan Asen the second lived there. Complex The whole stronghold is girdled by thick walls reaching up to and was served by three gates. The main gate was at the hill's westernmost part, on a narrow rock massif, and featured a draw-bridge. The second gate is away from the first one and the third one, which existed until 1889, is further. The palace is on the hill's central and plain part, which was a closed complex encircled by a fortified wall, two towers and two entrances, a main one from the north and one from the south. It featured a throne room, a palace church and a royal residential part and encompassed . On the top of the hill is the patriarchate, a complex with an area of about . The Cathedral of the Ascension of the Lord, built on the remains of a late Roman basilica, was reconstructed in 1981 and painted in 1985. The frescoes inside, painted in a striking modernist style rather than in the style of traditional Orthodox frescoes, depict conventional Christian subjects as well as glorious and tragic moments of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The church has not been reconsecrated. Baldwin's Tower (–ë–∞–ª–¥—É–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –∫—É–ª–∞), a modern reconstruction of a medieval tower modeled after the tower in Cherven and built in 1930, is in the southeastern part of the fortress. It is at the place of the original medieval tower where Latin Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople found his death as a prisoner of Kaloyan of Bulgaria. During the Middle Ages, residential buildings, craftsman's workshops and numerous churches and monasteries were situated on the slopes of the Tsarevets hill. Archaeologists have discovered 400 residential buildings, differentiated in quarters, over 22 churches and 4 monasteries. Tsarevets hill is also the location of Execution Rock, an outcropping over the Yantra River from which traitors were pushed to their deaths and their bodies fell into the river.

It is the first part of a trilogy of stories, continued in The Order of the Stones (2007) and The Open-Time (2010). Synopsis Among the asteroids at the edge of the mysterious Great Void, where the universe is still in formation, Val√©rian and Laureline along with a Schniarfeur living weapon are working as travelling salesmen, hawking their wares from a battered old space truck, frequently harassed by the local police force who take their orders from the Triumvirate of Rubanis. At one of their stops they befriend a young girl, Ky-Ga√Ø, who has lost her job after the spacesuit factory in which she worked closed down. Laureline takes Ky-Ga√Ø on as an assistant. When some of their merchandise is stolen by the Limboz, creatures from the Great Void who have lost their planet, Val√©rian and Laureline give chase. Catching the Limboz, Val√©rian agrees to let them go only if they'll give them information about the location of the Earth which Val√©rian and Laureline believe is located somewhere in the Great Void. Acting on the information given by the Limboz, Val√©rian and Laureline make for Port Abyss, the only free port at the edge of the Great Void. There they meet Singh'a Rough'a, a space captain who is mounting a voyage of exploration into the Great Void. Singh'a Rough'a takes an interest in the spacesuits that Laureline is selling; she needs them for her expedition crew. However, while Laureline and Singh'a Rough'a are negotiating, the police, acting under the orders of the Triumvirate of Rubanis, arrive and arrest Val√©rian and the Schniarfeur. While Val√©rian and Schniarfeur languish in prison, Laureline and Ky-Ga√Ø return to Ky-Ga√Ø's old factory; they have the notion of re-opening it so that they can make the spacesuits to fulfill Singh'a Rough'a's order. As they go to work, Laureline confesses to Ky-Ga√Ø that she and Val√©rian are only posing as merchants ‚Äì in reality they are trying to find the location of Earth. At the prison, Val√©rian gets talking to one of his fellow prisoners who tells him of an encounter he had with a mysterious stone that appeared to be alive. This tallies with what the Limboz had earlier told Val√©rian and Laureline. Bribing one of the guards, Val√©rian and Schniarfeur make their escape and rendezvous with Laureline and Ky-Ga√Ø, who are bringing the finished spacesuits to Singh'a Rough'a. Laureline realises that the Great Void is too dangerous a place to bring Ky-Ga√Ø; Val√©rian gives her the Schniarfeur, who has been studying business administration, as a present and the two decide to re-open the spacesuit factory as a business together. In the Great Void, the Triumvirate of Rubanis meet with one of the giant sentient stones, the Wolochs. The Wolochs tell the Triumvirate that Val√©rian and Laureline have escaped and that they are not happy about Singh'a Rough'a's expedition. Evading the police, Val√©rian and Laureline reach Singh'a Rough'a's ship, impressing her sufficiently that she allows them to join her crew.

It has about 1,400 inhabitants. Polish minority constitute 15.9% of the population. Etymology The name of Chotƒõbuz is derived from an old Slavic personal name ChociebƒÖd (KocobƒÖd, as the beginning Ch was often transformed into K). Geography Chotƒõbuz lies on the border with Poland, on the left bank of the Olza River, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. There is a border crossing with Poland in the municipality, one of the largest in the country and the largest between the Czech Republic and Poland. It is connected with the Polish one by the long bridge built in 1991 running along the Olza River. History Chotƒõbuz is one of the oldest villages in Cieszyn Silesia. There was a fortified settlement (gr√≥d) of the Golensizi tribe in this place called Cieszynisko (or Old Cieszyn). It was an important center since the 8th century. After decline of the settlement at the beginning of the 12th century, it was relocated to Wzg√≥rze Zamkowe (castle hill) in Cieszyn. Near the old place a new settlement was created, Podobora. It is today an archaeological site and was partly rebuilt to form archeopark which is possible to visit. Chotƒõbuz was first mentioned in the document of Pope Gregory IX issued in 1229 among villages belonging to Benedictine abbey in Tyniec, as Koczobontz.Hos√°k et al. 1970, 323. In 1268 it was bestowed by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolski to the newly established Benedictine abbey in Orlov√°. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz and Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. Chotƒõbuz as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 975 in 1880 to 1,173 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (between 95.1% and 97.1%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 39 or 3.4% in 1910) and Czech-speaking (at most 17 or 1.5% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Protestants (52.6%), followed by Roman Catholics (46.8%), 5 Jews and 3 persons adhering to another faiths. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. Remains of an old Gothic fort from the 13th century still remain, in its vicinity a Renaissance fort was later built. It was eventually rebuilt into a ch√¢teau at the beginning of the 19th century by the new owner. The Ch√¢teau gained its current look in 1875-1879, when it was completely rebuilt. It was again renovated in 1947. From 1974 to 1997 Chotƒõbuz was administratively a part of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n.

In the same year he set a temporary Kenyan 5000 m record of 13:01.82 in Zurich. He participated in the Olympic finals of 1988 and 1992 but did not win a medal. He also was the first person to break 27:00 in the 10,000 m in 1993. Biography Ondieki attended Iowa State University where he captured four Big Eight conference titles, three of them in cross country. Ondieki received All-America accolades six times at Iowa State. Although he never won an NCAA individual championship, he came close on several occasions, earning NCAA runner-up honors three times and third-place status three times. Except for the NCAA championship, he won every cross country meet he competed in during the 1983 and 1984 seasons. Ondieki was known for his demanding training sessions and his ability to run constantly at a high pace. However, he lacked a finishing kick, a weakness exploited by his opponents in the 1992 Olympic 5,000 m final in Barcelona. In 1993, Ondieki became the first athlete to break the 27-minute barrier over 10,000 meters when he ran 26:58.38 at the Bislett Games in Oslo on July 10. His time broke the mark set by Richard Chelimo only five days earlier in Stockholm by over 9 seconds. From 1989 to 1993, Ondieki was ranked in the top 5 in the world in the 5,000 meters by Track & Field News, with his number one ranking coming in 1991. In 1993, Track & Field News ranked him number one in the world in the 10,000 meters. Ondieki married Lisa Martin, an Australian marathon runner. In 1990 they had a baby girl named Emma Ondieki. Today, Ondieki and Martin are divorced. In September 1991 both he and Martin attended the 1991 AFL Grand Final as a part of the prematch entertainment.

As a college coach, Spivey used a series of quotes to motivate his athletes. He would say, \\"Sit in the chair\\" to explain the importance of trusting the coach. \\"No deposit, no return\\" signified that desirable results in the championship end of the season would only come with hard work early on in the season. \\"The hay is in the barn\\" was used during the championship end of the season to remind the athletes that they'd already done all the work they could do and now was time to reap the benefits. The phrases \\"Reach out and slap a hand,\\" \\"People in the Sears Tower would pay to run with you guys\\" and \\"It's great to be alive\\" were all used to motivate athletes during hard workouts.

These standards replaced earlier versions by the PAS and the NCIB. The WGA developed these standards in conjunction with the Better Business Bureau, professional accounting organizations, charitable organizations, and foundations that fund grants. The WGA explains that these standards were developed \\"to assist donors in making sound giving decisions and to foster public confidence in charitable organizations. The standards seek to encourage fair and honest solicitation practices, to promote ethical conduct by charitable organizations and to advance support of philanthropy.\\" The standards set a baseline for ethical governance, responsible fundraising, and transparency of financial operations. Adherence to the Standards for Charity Accountability is voluntary; no charity is legally bound to submit documentation of its operations to the WGA. The absence of documentation, or the absence of a charity's inclusion in the BBB reporting system, may not necessarily indicate negative or unlawful behavior on the part of the charity. Evaluated charities A listing of charitable organizations currently evaluated by the WGA is available on its website.National Charity Report Directory, from Give.org Criticism USA Today reported that the WGA‚Äôs charity seal program had come under fire. O‚ÄôDonnell, Jayne.\\"BBB's charity ratings, seal of approval under fire,\\" USA Today, Dec. 27, 2012. The WGA licenses its seal to charities that meet its 20 standards of accountability at rates from $1,000 to $15,000 annually. This income provides 67 percent of the WGA‚Äôs budget. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said that this financial relationship raises questions about \\"credibility and possible conflicts of interest.\\" The American Institute of Philanthropy, another charity rater, criticized the WGA for taking money from the same charities it was rating. The WGA replied that there is \\"a strict separation between the people who do the accreditations and the ones who work on the seal programs.\\" See also *Charitable organization *Charity assessment *Charity watchdog *Philanthropy References External links *give.org ‚Äî BBB Wise Giving Alliance site Charity in the United States ","title":"BBB Wise Giving Alliance"},{"id":"3516843","text":"Patrik Alexander Sundstr√∂m (born March 14, 1987) is a Swedish-Canadian hockey coach and former player.http://www.arbetarbladet.se/ishockey/shl/forre- brynascentern-slutar-bara-30-ar-gammal He played for IF Bj√∂rkl√∂ven, Bryn√§s IF, Mora IK in the Swedish Allsvenskan.

It currently has 400,000 registered members. FishingKaki.com is a thriving forum for fishing enthusiasts in Singapore and beyond, getting visitors from many parts of the world including the US, UK and Australia. Now owned and led by Luke Maow Bear, FishingKaki.com has since been revamped in all aspects, which includes design, structure and direction. FishingKaki.com has since migrated to Amazon Web Services for both speed and stability. Forum Structure The structure of Fishingkaki.com is divided based on a few major categories. =FishingKaki.com Announcements= Announcements of events and new products are posted here. =Catch Reports= This forum is for users to post their Catch Reports (CRs). Catch Reports are articles or a collection of pictures of a catch or fishing trip. =Discussion= This is the main forum which is divided by fishing type. Examples are Luring, jigging, surf casting and fly fishing. Also under this section is \\"Coffeeshop Talk\\", which is for non-fishing related discussions. =Looking For Kakis= Users looking for others to fish with post here. This includes charters who have signed up as partners of FishingKaki.com. =Partners= Partners of FishingKaki.com are listed here.

History  =Fishing Singapore= Originally started as Spikeman's Fishing Singapore, it was a hobby website created by Spike Choo in 1997 with angling as its main theme. In 1998, KC, an administrator running the Singapore ONE Community Portal, invited Spike to host his site in the S-One Portal. Spike took the opportunity to rename the site to Fishing Singapore. KC also helped to create a Fishing Forum as part of the new website. As Singapore's first ever Fishing Internet forum, it rapidly gained popularity among the younger generation of anglers in Singapore. It was then known as Fishing Singapore Forum. Spike got to know John Hooi via the forum and after a few fishing trips, invited John to help manage the site with him. John Hooi served as both the administrator of the forum and the webmaster of the Fishing Singapore website together with Spike. John later invited four forum moderators to run the forum. They were Michael Lim, Jimmy Aw, Abang and Loh Tee. The technical functions of this board were limited which gave rise to many controversial issues that escalated into countless internet flame-wars. Among the issues were the administrator John Hooi's capability to oversee the forum, the four moderators' ability to moderate and much mud-slinging among the commercial entities in Singapore's fishing industry. It was a very active and chaotic period with constant flaming among many parties. =Fishingkaki.com (Past)= The transformation from Fishing Singapore to Fishingkaki.com took place in 2001 when S-ONE announced that they were shutting down the Fishing Singapore Forum. John Hooi then started funding the site himself and officially registered the domain name Fishingkaki.com and with the help of his friend Viper of Console City, began FishingKaki with a forum based on the PHP Bulletin Board system. The site was hosted in the U.S.. All users of Fishing Singapore Forum migrated over to the new site and soon after that, the company S-One ceased its services. With the advanced functions of PHPBB, the forum was structured into different categories. A special fly fishing section was introduced, headed by Jimmy Aw. With this new forum, members were now required to register with a valid email address to access its functions as opposed to how it was done before. Spike and John had ideas to turn Fishingkaki into a web portal but plans for this were soon abandoned. Spike, who designed and conceptualised both the Fishingkaki logo and motto, handed the rights for the design to John as a goodwill gesture when he retired from active participation in the running of the new site. During this period, Fishingkaki grew into a successful internet forum with more than 5000 registered members managed by more than 16 moderators. Fishingkaki.com was migrated from US to Singapore in 2002. In 2003, Fishingkaki.com was officially registered as a Private Limited Company with John Hooi and Mike Goh as the company's Directors. The site crashed in March 2005 and a new server was found and Fishingkaki was recreated on 20 April 2005 with the help of Mike Goh and staff of Fragnetics.com before they shifted yet again to NSWGroup who currently hosts Fishingkaki. Jeffrey Tee joined Fishingkaki.com Pte Ltd as a Director in 2004. Together with John Hooi and Mike Goh, these 3 Directors are officially known as the Consultants of Fishingkaki. Each one has their own unique areas of expertise relating to the running of the forum.

NHSBT Blood Donation was previously known as the National Blood Service until it merged with UK Transplant in 2005 to form a NHS special health authority. Other official blood services in the United Kingdom include the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the Welsh Blood Service. Donations The service depends entirely on voluntary donations from the public. Originally, Blood was collected from various donor clinics located over the country. In 1994, the first mobile session was held in Elstree, hosted by the Joely Bear Appeal. Currently, Blood donation sessions are set up throughout the country and take place in many diverse venues. From village halls, to mobile collection units (known as Bloodmobiles), and sessions set up companies and organisations so people can donate at work. New donors are generally required to be fit and healthy, weigh between and and be aged between 17 and 66. However, regular donors are permitted to donate past the age of 70 as long as they remain healthy. Female donors may give blood up to three times a year (once every 16 weeks) and male donors may give blood four times a year (every 12 weeks). =Pre-donation and exceptions= Prior to each donation, the donor's iron level is checked to make sure they are not anaemic. The donor will be required to fill in a questionnaire to provide consent and declare that the donation will be safe (for example, stating that the donor does not have a heart condition), and it is safe to give the donor's blood to someone else. ;Weight *To give blood donors must weigh over . For donors who are female, aged under 20 years old, weigh under and are under height, the blood service will need to confirm their estimated blood volume is over 3500 ml. ;HIV *Every single blood donation is tested for HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and Hepatitis B and C. Infected blood is not used in transfusions but tests may not always detect the early stages of viral infection. ;Pregnancy/Travel *Women should not give blood if they are pregnant or have had a baby in the last six months. People should wait six months after returning from a malarial area before giving blood, and should inform the National Blood Service if they have visited Central or South America at any time. ;People who cannot give blood *People should not give blood if they have donated with less than 12 weeks' interval between donations, or 16 weeks if they are female. If they have a chesty cough, sore throat or active cold sore, are currently taking antibiotics or you have just finished a course within the last seven days or have had any infection in that last two weeks. *If they have had hepatitis or jaundice in the last 12 months, or had a tattoo, semi-permanent make up or any cosmetic treatments that involves skin piercing in the last 4 months. *If they have had acupuncture in the last 4 months, unless this was done within the NHS or by a qualified healthcare professional registered with a statutory body. *If a member of their family (parent, brother, sister or child) has suffered with CJD (Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease) or if they have ever received human pituitary extract (which was used in some growth hormone or fertility treatments before 1985). *If they have received blood or think they may have received blood during the course of any medical treatment or procedure anywhere in the world on or after the 1st January 1980. ;People who may not be able to give blood: *People who have had a serious illness or major surgery in the past or are currently on medication, or if they have had complicated dental work. People who have had simple fillings are ok to give blood after 24 hours, as are simple extractions after 7 days. *People who have been in contact with an infectious disease or have been given certain immunisations in the last four weeks, as well as people presently on a hospital waiting list or undergoing medical tests. ;People who can never give blood *People who have ever had syphilis, HTLV (Human T-lymphotropic virus), HIV or Hepatitis C, worked as a prostitute, or have ever injected themselves with drugs. ;People should not give blood for 3 months after sex with: *A man (if they are male). *Men who have had anal or oral sex with another man (with or without a condom) are deferred from blood donation for 3 months. *A man who has had sex with another man (if you're a female). *A prostitute. *Anyone who has ever injected themselves with drugs. *Anyone with haemophilia or a related blood clotting disorder who has received clotting factor concentrates. *Anyone of any race who has been sexually active in parts of the world where AIDS/HIV is very common. Note: This 3 month deferral period only applies to England, Wales and Scotland - not Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland still has a 12 month ban in place for these groups. =Donating blood= Once the preliminary checks are complete, the donor lies on a bed and a sterile hypodermic needle connected to a bag is inserted into a vein in their inner elbow. The donation usually lasts between five and 10 minutes, during which of whole blood is given. =Post- donation= The dressing applied to a donor's arm after giving blood Following the donation (and subsequent dressing of the wound), donors are invited to refreshments. This period serves two vital purposes: to replace certain lost fluids, and to allow staff to monitor the donor's wellbeing. Donations can also be taken by machines called cell separators, usually in larger blood donation centres located in city centres. These machines use a process called apheresis to collect either blood plasma only, or plasma and platelets, the other blood cells being returned to the patient. Platelets are the tiny fragments of cells in the blood which help it to clot and so stop bleeding, and are used in the treatment of cancer and leukaemia. A constant supply is vital because platelets only last five days once collected. People who give plasma and/or platelets can donate every two weeks, and each donation usually gives two or three adult doses. One adult dose of platelets would otherwise require four whole blood donations. =Blood Component donations= Blood is made in the bone marrow. It is composed of red blood cells, platelets, plasma and white blood cells, collectively referred to as blood components. Donations given at regular blood donation sessions are referred to as \\"Whole Blood\\". Platelets are very small cells. They work with the clotting factors in plasma to form a mesh \\"plug\\" to stop or prevent bleeding. Plasma is the fluid part of the blood. It contains protein, salts and clotting factors. White cells fight harmful bacteria and help prevent infection. Red cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Most platelet donations are given to patients who are unable to make enough platelets in their bone marrow. For example, patients with leukaemia or other cancers may have too few platelets as the result of their disease or treatment. Also after major surgery or extensive injury, patients may need platelet transfusions to replace those lost through bleeding. Platelets are often life-saving and special in that they can help up to 3 adults or even 12 children. As platelets can only be stored for a few days, regular and frequent donors are in great demand and that is why platelet donors are asked to attend at least 8 - 10 times per year. Controversy The service had come under criticism for a long implemented policy of banning men who have sex with men (MSM) from ever being blood donors. University students in both England and Scotland protested against the ban, and University of Birmingham's Guild of Students banned the National Blood Service from setting up a recruitment stall during Freshers' week. The policy was changed in 2011 to prevent MSMs from donating for 12 months after having anal or oral sex with another man (with or without a condom). This also applied to women who have had sex with a MSMs. In November 2017 the referral period on MSMs was reduced to 3 months for both MSMs and women who have sex with them. Legal A vs The National Blood Authority (Queens Bench Division). This trial concerned the claims of 114 Claimants, for recovery of damages arising out of their infection with Hepatitis C, from blood and blood products through blood transfusions from 1 March 1988. All the claimants received blood transfusions or blood products usually in the course of undergoing surgery, whether consequent upon having suffered an accident or otherwise, immediately after childbirth.

This largely brown bird, which commonly holds its tail raised, is found in scrubland and lightly wooded habitats, often near rocks, from Kenya and Ethiopia to Gambia (a large part if its range is in the Sudanian Savanna). As traditionally defined, it is the only member of Ptilopachus, but based on genetic evidence, this genus also includes Nahan's \\"francolin\\".Crowe, T.

(Abstract).Gill, F, & Donsker, D. eds. (2010). IOC World Bird Names. Version 2.7. Accessed 15 January 2011. English name Some confusion exists in the naming of this species because the name of this bird in many languages translates literally into English as \\"rock partridge\\". For instance, in Dutch the species is rotspatrijs, in German - Felsenhenne, in French - poulette de roche - all literal translations of \\"rock partridge\\". The bird known as rock partridge in English is actually a member of another genus, Alectoris graeca. The confusion is further compounded as in some languages, Alectoris species are known by names that literally translate as stone partridge. In Dutch, steenpatrijs, in German Steinhuhn; red-legged partridge (A. rufa) being rode steenpatrijs in Dutch. Further complication arises as, particularly within the US, the name \\"rock partridge\\" has been used for a variety of Alectoris species and hybrids. The international bird trade, for sport, aviaries' and meat, has led to misapplication of various of these common and scientific names. Alectoris and Ptilopachus species are actually very different in size and habits, Ptilopachus being only 20‚Äì25 cm long.  Taxonomy  =Subspecies= The four recognized subspecies are: * P. p. brehmi (Neumann, 1908) * P. p. florentiae (Ogilvie-Grant, 1900) * P. p. major (Neumann, 1908) - Abyssinian stone partridge - rocky areas of northwest Ethiopia * P. p. petrosus (Gmelin, 1789) - nominate - Senegal to South Sudan, northern Uganda and northern Kenya Description The stone partridge is exceptional among gamebirds in that the female, to human eyes, is showier than the male. Both sexes are predominantly earthy chocolate brown above, with sparse, pale, cream-grey spotting. The head, neck, and chest are paler brown and have broad cream edging to the feathers that gives the bird a scaled appearance. In males, the lower chest and belly are orange-cream; in females, very pale cream. Both sexes raise their crown feathers to form a rudimentary crest, but the feathers of females are somewhat longer, hence more obvious when raised. Eggs are pale pink, fading to cream; juveniles are dark chocolate-brown throughout, moulting into adult plumage at several weeks old. In captivity at least, the male plays a major role in both incubation and rearing of the young, offering young small items of food by picking them up, dropping them, and calling to the chicks. Distribution and habitat Widespread and common throughout its large range, the stone partridge is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Since 2000, the stone partridge has been imported into the United States and Europe, where it is hoped that it will become established in zoos and bird collections.

The theatre was designed and constructed by the architect Fran√ßois Debret on the site of the garden of the H√¥tel de Choiseul on the rue Lepeletier.Mead 1991, p. 48. Due to the many changes in government and management during the theatre's existence, it had a number of different official names, the most important of which were: Th√©√¢tre de l'Acad√©mie Royale de Musique (1821-1848), Op√©ra-Th√©√¢tre de la Nation (1848-1850), Th√©√¢tre de l'Acad√©mie Nationale de Musique (1850-1852), Th√©√¢tre de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale de Musique (1852-1854), Th√©√¢tre Imp√©rial de l'Op√©ra (1854-1870), and Th√©√¢tre National de l'Op√©ra (1870-1873).Levin, Alicia. \\"A documentary overview of musical theaters in Paris, 1830-1900\\" in Fauser 2009, p. 382. History Performance of Charles-Simon Catel's opera Les bayad√®res for the inauguration of the Paris Opera's Salle Le Peletier on 16 August 1821 When King Louis XVIII's nephew, Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry, was fatally stabbed on the night of 13 February 1820 in front of the former theatre of the Paris Opera, the Salle de la rue de Richelieu, the king decided that the theatre would be demolished in order to build a commemorative chapel in its place. However, the project to build a chapel was never carried out due to the 1830 revolution. Today the Fontaine Louvois in the Square Louvois occupies the spot where the chapel would have been built.Barbier 1995, pp. 34-35. The Salle de la rue de Richelieu had been the principal venue of the Paris Opera since 1794. Very soon after the death of his nephew in February 1820, the king commissioned the architect Fran√ßois Debret to design a new theatre for the Op√©ra on the Rue Le Peletier, which was completed one year later. During the construction the opera and ballet companies occupied the Th√©√¢tre Favart and the Salle Louvois.Pitou 1983, 1: 38, 44. The Salle Le Peletier was inaugurated on 16 August 1821 with a mixed-bill that opened with the anthem \\"Vive Henry VIII\\", and included the composer Catel's opera Les bayad√®res and the Ballet Master Gardel's ballet Le Retour de Z√©phire.Pitou 1990, pp. 758‚Äì760. Although the theatre was meant to be temporary and was built of wood and plaster, it continued to be used by the Op√©ra for more than fifty years. Many of the great grand operas of the 19th century were presented for the first time on its stage, among them: Rossini's Guillaume Tell (1829), Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable (1831), Hal√©vy's La Juive (1835), and Verdi's Don Carlos (1867).Simeone 2000, p. 192. The theatre, which was 14,000 square metres in area with a 104 ft. stage, was quite advanced for its time. On 6 February 1822 gas was used for the first time in order to light the stage effects in Nicolas Isouard's opera Aladin ou La Lampe merveilleuse.Simeone 2000, pp. 191-192. The stage and orchestra pit were able to be removed in order to transform the auditorium into a massive hall which could accommodate large balls and other festivities. =Ballet= Along with the Ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre in London, the Salle Le Peletier played host to the heyday of the romantic ballet, with such Balletmasters as Jules Perrot, Arthur Saint-L√©on, Filippo Taglioni, Joseph Mazilier, Jean Coralli, and Paul Taglioni staging many masterworks for the Paris Opera Ballet. Among these works: La Sylphide (1832), Giselle (1841), Paquita (1846), Le corsaire (1856), Le papillon (1860), La source (1866), and Copp√©lia (1870). Among the great ballerinas to grace the stage of the Op√©ra during this time were Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Carolina Rosati, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, and Fanny Cerrito.

Appleton and Company, New York (1859) pp. 172-173. =Fire= On the night of 29 October 1873, the Salle Le Peletier met the same fate as many of its predecessors: it was destroyed by a fire which raged for 27 hours, believed to have been started by the theatre's innovative gas lighting. Fortunately, in 1858 Emperor Napoleon III had hired the civic planner Baron Haussmann to begin construction on a second theatre for the Parisian Opera and Ballet based on the design of architect Charles Garnier. In 1875, the new theatre, today known as the Palais Garnier, was inaugurated.

There is a name of the same meaning in modern Sweden: Sm√•land, which would have been at a location known to Ptolemy in southeastern Scandinavia. It means \\"small land\\", which name refers to its broken and uncultivatable terrain; i.e., the province includes only small land for settlement purposes. As the name is based on the terrain, it would have been most likely kept over the centuries. The terrain encouraged emigration from Kalmar to Minnesota, where the land was much bigger. As the name of the Favonae is based on the terrain, they might well have been known by some other, ethnic name, not reported by Ptolemy. There is a notable suggestion by Kendrick, published in 1930 (see under Dauciones), that the Favonae were not in Sweden but were on the coast of Finland opposite. This hypothesis is based entirely on the argument that the Levonii of Ptolemy are the Swedes proper and therefore the east of them must be Finland. However, Kendrick also argues that the Chaideinoi could not have been in Hedemark because the latter was too remote for Ptolemy. If Hedemark is to be considered remote, then Finland must be even more so; moreover, Ptolemy does mention the Finns and does not identify them with the Favonae. Kendrick does not supply us with any names from Finland.

EMA was transferred from the Attorney-General's Department in a machinery of government change to become a division of the newly established Department of Home Affairs in 2018. Emergency Management involves the plans, structures and arrangements which are established to bring together the normal endeavours of government, voluntary and private agencies in a comprehensive and coordinated way to deal with the whole spectrum of emergency needs including prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. Until late 2001, EMA was an agency within the former Australian Defence Force Support Command and then the Department of Defence Corporate Support Group. Role Australian state and territory authorities have a constitutional responsibility, within their boundaries, for coordinating and planning for the response to disasters and civil emergencies. When the total resources (government, community and commercial) of an affected state or territory cannot reasonably cope with the needs of the situation, the state or territory government can seek assistance from the Australian Government. On request, the Australian Government will provide and coordinate physical assistance to the States in the event of a major natural, technological or civil defence emergency. Such physical assistance will be provided when State and Territory resources are inappropriate, exhausted or unavailable. The Australian Government accepts responsibility and prepares plans for providing Commonwealth physical resources in response to such requests. Emergency Management Australia is nominated as the agency responsible for planning and coordinating Commonwealth physical assistance to the states and territories under the Commonwealth Government Disaster Response Plan (COMDISPLAN). Planning The Commonwealth Government Disaster Response Plan (COMDISPLAN) provides the framework for addressing state and territory requests for Commonwealth physical assistance arising from any type of emergency. COMDISPLAN is normally activated when Commonwealth assistance for emergency response or short-term recovery is requested or likely to be requested. Structure After the 2009 restructure of the Attorney-General's Department, responsibility for the Australian Emergency Management Institute (formerly the Emergency Management Australia Institute) was taken over by the National Security Capability Development Division. EMA is made up of the Crisis Management Branch, Disaster Recovery Branch, and the Disaster Preparedness Branch.

It is separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called the Great Deep. Geography Thorney Island in 1835 (centre left) before being joined to the mainland with seawalls The village of West Thorney lies on the east coast of the island and has been incorporated into a British Army military base which occupies the southern part of the island, south of Great Deep. A coastal public footpath, part of the Sussex Border Path encircles the island, but public access to the south of the island is limited to the footpath and the church of St Nicholas at West Thorney. Walkers using the footpath may be asked by intercom to provide their contact details (name, address and mobile phone number) at the security gates to access the southern part of the island. Walkers must keep to the footpath marked with the yellow posts. During the winter months, fortnightly shoots are held on Thorney for partridge, pheasant and snipe. To the south of the island is Pilsey Island, now joined to Thorney Island by a sandbank, which is an RSPB nature reserve. The 2001 census showed the island to have a resident population of 1,079. Climate The climate of Thorney Island is generally milder than elsewhere in the UK, but slightly cooler than other areas locally due to being quite rural. The record high temperature is on 6 August 2003 and the record low is on 13 January 1987. The Met Office has an official weather station situated at the Royal Artillery base on Thorney Island. RAF Thorney Island and Baker Barracks In 1938, the RAF airfield on Thorney Island was built. Subsequently the Royal Navy expressed an interest in using the base. In 1980 West Thorney became host to many hundreds of Vietnamese families, accepted by the United Kingdom for settlement in the United Kingdom. In 1985, a series of experiments referred to as the \\"Thorney Island Heavy Gas Dispersion Trials\\" investigating atmospheric dispersion of gases was carried out on the island. 1984 saw the base renamed Baker Barracks to house a Royal Artillery unit, the 26th Field Regiment Royal Artillery, armed with the FH70. Later, the 26th Field Regiment Royal Artillery was replaced on the island by the 47th Regiment Royal Artillery, armed with the Starstreak HVM. In January 2008, the 12th Regiment Royal Artillery moved to the island on their return from Germany. 47 Regiment subsequently relocated from Thorney Island to Larkhill, Wiltshire under restructuring of the British Army as part of the Army 2020 programme. In 2009, the airfield was used as a test track for a British-built steam car hoping to smash the longest standing land speed record. The British Steam Car Challenge team included test driver Don Wales, nephew of the late Donald Campbell and grandson of Sir Malcolm Campbell.

He was the author of The Life and Miracles of St. William of Norwich, a hagiography of William of Norwich that is considered an antisemitic text. Career Thomas was presumably born in Monmouth, since he is identified by the town's name. Historian Gavin I. Langmuir says that he appears to have been \\"respectably educated\\".Langmuir, Gavin I (1996). Toward a Definition of Antisemitism, University of California Press, pp. 216ff He arrived in Norwich in 1149‚Äì50, a few years after the 1144 death of William of Norwich, a child whose unsolved death was blamed on the local Jewish community. Thomas quickly devoted himself to the promotion of William's claims to sainthood, by collecting evidence of his holiness and by arguing that he had been martyred by the Jews in a ritual murder. Thomas of Monmouth unsuccessfully tried to get William of Norwich canonized as a saint, but did succeed in creating a cult around him in Norwich. He contended that he had received visions from the founding Bishop of Norwich, Herbert de Losinga, who had died in 1119. Losinga told him that William's body should be moved into the chapter house of the monastery. Thomas had to battle the sceptical prior Elias, who was unconvinced of William's sanctity. But the body was moved in 1150, the year in which Elias died, and by then the cult of William was established. Life of William The crucifixion of William as described by Thomas, depicted on a rood screen in Holy Trinity church, Loddon, Norfolk Thomas heard from a converted Jew named Theobald of Cambridge that every year there is an international council of Jews at which they choose the country in which a child will be killed during Easter. This is because a Jewish prophecy says that the killing of a Christian child each year will ensure that the Jews will be restored to the Holy Land. Monmouth claimed that in 1144 England was chosen, and the leaders of the Jewish community delegated the Jews of Norwich to perform the killing. They then abducted and crucified William.Paper on William of Norwich presented to the Jewish Historical Society of England by Raphael Langham This is the earliest recorded ritual murder accusation against the Jews. According to Langmuir, the evidence strongly suggests that Thomas had discovered that the Jews had crucified William in a manner designed to mimic the death of Jesus. In his own account, this specific claim is never made by any of the earlier accusers, who only say that Jews were responsible for William's death. Even Theobald only speaks of sacrifice. Thomas of Monmouth's account helped inflame antisemitic sentiment in England, resulting in the eventual expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290. Historian Gillian Bennett says of the book that \\"The tone throughout is intemperate, and the gloating description of William's martyrdom quite sick. In Thomas's eyes, there is nothing that Jews will not stoop to, and they are constantly referred to as 'our enemies'.\\"Gillian Bennett, Bodies: Sex, Violence, Disease, and Death in Contemporary Legend, University of Mississippi Press, Jackson, 2005, pp.255 ff. Thomas continued to add material to his book after the first volume came out in 1150. The second volume, probably written up in 1155, is even more \\"strident\\" in tone, according to Bennett, suggesting that Thomas' claims had met with considerable scepticism and opposition. He marshals evidence to support his assertions. It is only in this volume that the claims about an annual crucifixion ritual are made. Later volumes concentrate on accumulating evidence of miraculous cures effected by William. A final volume was completed in 1172 and a preface was added. Nothing else is known about his life after this date. The single surviving manuscript of Thomas' work was discovered by M. R. James and published in 1896 with historical essays by James and Augustus Jessopp. =The Life and Passion of William of Norwich as antisemitic propaganda= The blood libel rumor eventually spread throughout the Christian world in the Middle Ages.

In Roman times, and presumably before, Thorney Island may have been part of a natural ford where Watling Street crossed the Thames, of particular importance before the construction of London Bridge.

It was released in 2006, and has sold around 200,000 copies in Japan. Loosely based on a classical Chinese novel, Shui Hu Zhuan by Shi Nai'an, Suikoden V centers on the political struggles of the Queendom of Falena, and takes place 6 in- universe years before the events of the first Suikoden. The player controls the Prince of Falena and travels the world, acquiring allies and dealing with the problems of the nation. The game features a vast array of characters, with over sixty characters usable in combat and many more able to help or hinder the Prince in a variety of ways. Gameplay Suikoden V is a role-playing video game and thus features many of the usual traits. The player controls the Prince and travels with him around the world map, advancing the plot by completing tasks and talking with other characters. The Prince can also recruit new characters to his cause, which often involves a short sidequest. In towns, the player can gather information, sharpen character's weaponry, learn new skills and buy equipment; wilderness areas generally feature random encounters with monsters. The game runs at 60 FPS and is the first 3d Suikoden game to feature a camera system similar to the top down perspective of the first 2 games. The battle system to Suikoden V features six person parties in combat rather than the four person parties of Suikoden IV, reversing a much- decried change. Each character is individually controllable, as well (as opposed to Suikoden III). A variety of statistics in Suikoden V determine in- game combat ability. Like in Suikoden III, there exists a skill system in Suikoden V; for instance, the \\"Stamina\\" skill increases a character's hit points. Different characters have affinities for different skills. Only two skills can be equipped to each character, though they can be switched at any time between battles. If all six characters lose all their hit points and are thus incapacitated, it is game over and the player must restart. Exceptions exist for certain plot battles in which winning is optional; the player can lose and the plot continues on, albeit in a slightly different fashion. The characters can be set up in a variety of fighting formations across a roughly 6x4 grid. Each formation allows the party to gain increased statistics, such as increased defense or increased attacks, occasionally offset by decreased stats in other categories, as well as a special attack based on the formation. New formations are acquired over the course of the game. Like in previous games, some characters have special cooperative attacks that can potentially do more damage. These attacks often do more damage than normal and cannot miss, but they also cannot receive critical damage bonuses and cannot hit targets multiple times. An auto-battle function is enable as well for quickly breezing through easy battles. Characters that don't participate directly in combat usually offer other services to the Prince, such as running a shop, giving clues for potential recruits, or aiding in the strategic war battles. Additionally, up to four characters may be kept in reserve of the current party; some non-combat characters, when in the reserve, offer minor benefits such as healing after battle or a greater chance of finding a special item after battle. Runes, the source of all magic in the world of Suikoden, are handled similarly to other Suikoden games. Characters have a certain number of spell usages per \\"spell level;\\" for instance, a character with four level 1 spell slots and a Water Rune could cast \\"Kindness Drops\\" (the level 1 Water Rune spell) four times. Other runes offer different benefits, and some may be used as often as desired. The strategic war battles from earlier Suikodens return for major army clashes, in real-time with more freedom of movement than the hex and square based earlier installments. Instead, the battlefield is now continuous. Both land and naval battles exist in Suikoden V; some battles even combine both elements. The system is analogous to Rock, Paper, Scissors, where cavalry beats infantry, infantry beats archers, and archers beat cavalry; at sea, ram ships are strong against archery ships, infantry ships defeat rams, and archery ships beat infantry ships. There are also additional benefits to having certain characters in certain units, such as magical attacks using runes or leadership bonuses. A few special units exist as well in beaver units and dragon cavalry units, which can travel on both sea and land. Suikoden V also contains a number of minigames, including, but not limited to, fishing, accessible through the character Subala, and Blind Man's Bluff, a card game that Linfa plays. Story =Setting= Suikoden V takes place in the Queendom of Falena, portraying the events of that region of the Suikoden world eight years before the events in Suikoden and 142 years after the events in Suikoden IV (~IS 449). The Queendom of Falena is a relatively rich land sustained by the Feitas River, which connects its disparate parts and enables trade and communication. It is ruled by Queen Arshtat and her husband Ferid, who have been a balancing and steady force since the demise of her somewhat rash mother. However, the tensions of the past have not been entirely settled. Arshtat's mother and aunt had been engaged in a covert struggle for power over the succession. Falena's government also has powerful nobles who maintain their own separate forces, loyal to them. Arshtat's hand in marriage was seen as key to gaining power in the future by the nobles; a civil war was narrowly averted when Ferid, a neutral outsider, won the Sacred Games and thus the right to marry Arshtat. Arshtat and Ferid begat two heirs, the Prince (named by the player, called Freyjdour in the manga) and Lymsleia. At the beginning of Suikoden V, the time has come for Lymsleia's Sacred Games, a gladiatorial tournament in which the winner may ask for the future Queen's hand in marriage. (As a Queendom rather than a Kingdom, the first-born female is in line for the throne.) Aside from the many freelancers, suitors, and independent nobles who desire this prize, the two most powerful noble houses both bear a special interest in it; like with Arshtat's Sacred Games, Lymsleia's hand could prove a crucial advantage. The Godwins believe that Falena needs to be more centralized, powerful and perhaps expansionistic. The Barows seek more to rebuild and trade with foreign nations. The Barows faction has of late been somewhat on the decline, though they are still powerful; a recent war with the neighboring New Armes Kingdom was fought on Barows-allied lands, while the Godwins remained safe and untouched in the west of Falena, perhaps explaining the Barows wish to not further antagonize Armes. The royal family and others worry that if a Godwin or Barows were to win, it might well trigger another struggle. A key part of the Suikoden setting is the existence of Runes, the source of all magic. Any person can have a rune inscribed on them, although some people are more talented in their use, and others can inscribe more than one rune (with three as the general maximum). In turn, all power from individual carved runes ultimately descends from the powerful 27 True Runes, which created the world in Suikodens mythology. Falena's national treasure is the Sun Rune, a True Rune which can both bring prosperity and growth as well as destruction and calamity. Falena also controls the \\"child\\" runes of the Sun Rune, the Dawn Rune and Twilight Rune. However, Falena's grip on the runes has gone somewhat awry. Two years prior to the start of Suikoden V, residents of Lordlake rioted and charged the East Palace, near the capital of Sol-Falena. In the confusion, the Dawn Rune, which was housed there, was stolen. Lordlake had previously been considered the most loyal of all the towns to the royal government and granted special privileges. With this seeming act of high treason by Lordlake, Arshtat took the Sun Rune upon herself, normally stored in Sol-Falena's palace on a pedestal, and used the Rune's power to scorch Lordlake's vegetation, wildlife and river, killing its leader Lord Rovere in the process. Since bearing the Sun Rune, the normally compassionate Arshtat has grown more and more erratic in behavior, prone to mood swings and wild fits of vengeance. =Characters= As with previous Suikoden titles, there are \\"108 Stars of Destiny\\" to recruit in the game. While some characters join as per the story's requirements, others require that the Prince recruit them either at a specific time, or by fulfilling particular conditions. As such, certain characters can be missed entirely. Some of the characters from Suikoden V appeared in earlier Suikoden games; as Suikoden V takes place before I‚ÄìIII, their experiences in Falena are a prequel of sorts for them. Notably, Georg Prime and Lorelai both play important roles in Suikoden V and appear in other games, while Viki, Jeane and Leknaat continue their run of all Suikoden games to date. Plot Two years after Lordlake was razed by her Sun Rune, Queen Arshtat dispatches her son the Prince, her sister Sialeeds, and their royal bodyguards Lyon and Georg Prime to inspect the state of the ruined town. The player as the Prince sees the grim state of the dried-up town and report on it, but Arshtat scorns this; she declares that Lordlake's citizens deserve their desolation for stealing the Dawn Rune. Arshtat's husband Ferid pulls her back to her senses, and she dismisses the inspection party with a whisper. The next issue of contention is the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held somewhat early for the ten-year-old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing themselves with a champion, hail from rival noble houses: the foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fianc√©, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified. However, Lord Marscal Godwin, Gizel's father, is less than impressed with Gizel's activities, thinking that he has made an enemy of the Prince and the royal family as a whole with his plotting. Additionally, the royal family took Zegai, the Barows champion, into their own personal custody, who could perhaps help reveal the Godwins cheating and offer an excuse to annul the engagement. Thus, the Godwins launch a preemptive attack at the engagement ceremony in Sol-Falena, Falena's capital. Arshtat and Ferid had anticipated and prepared for the attack, but not the involvement of the elite Nether Gate assassins, who overwhelm the palace's defenses. The struggle culminates in Arshtat and Ferid's deaths, while Lymsleia finds herself a captive. The Prince (whose irrelevance to the line of succession made him the lowest-priority target), Lyon, Georg and Sialeeds are forced to flee. The Prince searches first for a sanctuary, then for a way to fight back. He finds both (temporarily) as a guest of the influential noble Salum Barows, Lord Godwin's long-time rival. Salum (with his son Euram alongside) clearly plans to be the senior partner in his alliance with the Prince, but the Prince must take what allies he can find. Reluctantly, Sialeeds suggests bringing in help in the form of the legendary tactician Lucretia Merces, whom the Prince frees from prison. With her intelligence and vast network of contacts, Lucretia finds out that the Barows were behind the theft of the Dawn Rune ‚Äì an act of high treason. With this revelation, the Prince is able to convince the Barows' allies to join him personally, including even Salum's daughter Luserina. The recovered Dawn Rune picks the Prince as its new bearer, even though the Prince can never inherit the throne. Lucretia guides the Prince and his army in establishing a headquarters, forging alliances, restoring Lordlake, and winning a long streak of battles. The Godwins crown Lymsleia Queen and claim to fight in her name, but lose the public relations war due to the Prince's resistance, the claims of a coup, the restoration of Lordlake (thus fixing a mistake of Arshtat's rule), and the Godwins' army commanders foolish brutality. The civil war almost comes to a close when Lymsleia takes the field personally, officially due to the Godwin's failure to put down the \\"rebellion\\", but actually to be rescued by her brother. The Prince and his forces defeat her bodyguards and attempt to capture Lymsleia back; without Lymsleia, the Godwin's government would collapse. At this juncture, however, Sialeeds defects to Gizel's side, spiriting Lymsleia away and prolonging the conflict. Lyon is seriously wounded, preventing the party from pursuing Lymsleia. Meanwhile, Sialeeds takes up the Twilight Rune, the counterpart to the Dawn Rune held in Godwin territory. The Godwins enjoy a brief reversal in fortunes with new army levies and an alliance with a faction of Falena's neighbor Armes. However, Falena's normally neutral Dragon Cavalry enters the war on the Prince's side due to Armes' involvement, and the Godwins are driven back once more. Sialeeds ensures that the Prince's forces must capture Stormfist, the seat of Godwin power, and thoroughly erase any possible strongholds of Godwin sympathy. Despite seemingly being affiliated with the Godwins, however, Sialeeds incinerates a Godwin ambush of the Prince's force. Sialeeds later murders Salum Barows in Gizel's name, leaving the whimpering Euram alive with the venomous taunt that the Barows faction will surely fall to ruin with an idiot like him in charge. Only the capital city of Sol-Falena remains under Godwin control. The battle for it claims the lives of both Sialeeds and Gizel. As she expires, Sialeeds hints at her motives (which her maids confirm, if the player speaks with them later): she knew that, if the Prince had rescued Lymsleia when he first had the chance, things only would have returned to the way they were before, with the same corrupt nobility holding power struggles. The only way, in her mind, to secure the royal family's hold on the Queendom was to prolong the war such that the nobility would be completely and utterly ruined. By doing it in the Godwins' name, the Prince and Lymsleia could be rid of them without getting their hands dirty. As Gizel dies, felled by the Prince in a duel, he declares that Sialeeds was the only real winner. Lord Marscal, the only remaining Godwin, retreats with the Sun Rune to a nearby mountain range, where he meets the Prince in a showdown to prove that the royals can rule without the power of the Sun Rune. He draws the Rune's power into himself for the final battle with the Rune incarnation. In the ending, Lymsleia re-assumes the throne and dissolves the Senate, though a new representative parliament is created to replace it and advise the Queen. Depending on the player's choices and performance, several endings are possible. If very few optional stars of destiny were recruited, Lyon dies of the wounds she received earlier and the Prince wanders off alone in despair. If most but not all of the stars were recruited, the Prince travels the world with Georg. If all 108 Stars were recruited, Lyon survives. If the Prince chose to be nice when interacting with Lymsleia, he has the further option of staying in Falena and becoming the new Commander of the Queen's Knights, with Lyon by his side. Development Suikoden V was directed by Takahiro Sakiyama, a newcomer to the Suikoden franchise, and written by Kazuyoshi Tsugawa, who served as the writer for The Sword of Etheria and worked on the battle system design for Skies of Arcadia. The game started out as a gaiden to the series, with development beginning even before that of Suikoden IV. However, as the content that the team came up with grew, it eventually evolved into a main installment. Soundtrack The music was composed by Hudson Soft composers Yoshihiro Tsukahara, Takashi Watanabe, Kuniyuki Takahashi, and Chiharu Mukaiyama under the direction of Konami veteran Norikazu Miura. The opening theme, \\"Wind of Phantom\\", was composed by Yuji Toriyama, conducted by Robin Smith, and performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.https://vgmdb.net/album/920 The complete Genso Suikoden V OST, featuring all the music from the game in original form, was released on March 24, 2006. A shorter \\"Limited Edition\\" demo disc with 10 tracks had been released earlier. Reception Suikoden V had disappointing sales compared to earlier PlayStation 2 Suikodens. In 2006 in Japan, the game sold 194,780 copies, down from Suikoden IV's 303,069. Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one seven for a total of 32 out of 40. Elsewhere, the game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The plot received praise for the depth of its political maneuverings, even if the game starts off somewhat slowly: GameSpy said, \\"Suikoden V has a robust, well-done plot that doesn't telegraph every twist or conform to embarrassing clich√©s.\\" Most reviewers also found the cast of characters engaging, as well; GameSpot said that \\"Suikoden's always been great at making the stars evince unique personalities with just a few exchanges of conversation, and there's lots of interesting people to meet and lure to your forces.\\" Suikoden V also reversed some of the unpopular changes of Suikoden IV (such as 4-person parties), and offered some tie-ins to Suikoden and Suikoden II for fans of the original PlayStation games. The graphics and loading times were generally criticized, however. IGN wrote, \\"there's a ton of loading everywhere you turn. Moving from one area to another means 2-5 second loads; initiating a battle means 7-10 second loads; winning a skirmish brings 4-6 second loads afterwards.\\" Game Revolution said of the graphics that \\"Army battles and in-engine cut scenes look blocky and raw, but the CGI cut scenes are beautiful and detailed. Towns look great, but dungeons are horrid, bland, maze-like nightmares.\\" Suikoden V won IGN's 2006 award for Best Story on the PlayStation 2. It also won the Danish gaming magazine Gamereactors award for Best Story overall, and was named the 9th best game of the year by them.

Prince Christian was connected with the club in this era, and patrons of the club included Kings George V, George VI, and the Duke of Edinburgh, hence the club's nickname of \\"The Royalists\\". Over the years the club has competed in the Southern League (1895‚Äì96), West Berks League (1903‚Äì04), Great Western Suburban League (1904‚Äì22), Athenian League (1922‚Äì29), Spartan League (1929‚Äì39), Great Western Combination (1939‚Äì45), Corinthian League (1945‚Äì50), Metropolitan League (1950‚Äì60), Delphian League (1960‚Äì63), then the Athenian League again (1963‚Äì81), until joining the Isthmian League in 1981. During this time Windsor won their County Cup five times in a row (1941‚Äì45), which, until recent times was an English record. In 1922 they recorded their best ever Amateur Cup run, reaching the 4th Round Proper, and in 1925 reached the 2nd Round Proper of the FA Cup, losing 2‚Äì5 to Charlton Athletic at the Valley. Without doubt the best period in Windsor's history was the 1980s. Under manager Brian Caterer, they started the decade by winning the Athenian League and reaching the last four in the FA Vase (just one year after losing in the quarter final). The league title was retained in 1981, when they were also League Cup finalists and reached the 1st Round Proper in the FA Cup. Then came promotion to the Isthmian League Division Two, where they finished 5th in their first season. Promotion came the following season after finishing 2nd. The following season the Division One Championship was won, along with another appearance in the FA Cup 1st Round Proper.http://www.non- leagueclubdirectory.co.uk/index.php/clubs/windsor Their first campaign in the Premier Division saw them finish 5th as well as a draw at home against AFC Bournemouth in the second round of the FA Cup. Windsor eventually lost the replay with both sides already knowing that the winners would have a home tie against Manchester United in the next round. Since then they have had four further appearances in the 1st Round Proper of the FA Cup, and three appearances in the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup final, winning in 1988 and 1989. The 1990s started with Windsor celebrating their centenary in 1991/92. They suffered a poor following season and their 9-year spell in the Premier Division came to an end when they finished second from bottom and were relegated to Division One. 1993/94 saw them finish 21st again, to be relegated to Division Two and although they improved their position by one place the following season, it still wasn't enough to avoid the dubious honour for the third season running in 1994/95. Season 1995/96 saw a revival in the club's fortune when they finished third in Division Three and were the Isthmian League's leading scorers with 117 goals. Season 2000‚Äì01 saw a complete overhaul of the club and the changes were vindicated when the club achieved promotion to Division One by finishing runners-up. In November 2001, following a poor start to their Division One campaign, which wasn't helped by a horrendous early-season injury list, the Royalists finished in bottom place, although a league restructure meant relegation was never a worry. Season 2002‚Äì03 saw some more experienced faces added to the squad during the course of the season and the club enjoyed its best FA Trophy run for years beating Welling United, Hitchin Town and Vauxhall Motors before bowing out on penalties to Aylesbury United. Two years later a re-organisation of the English football league system saw them moved into the Premier Division, where they remained until another re-organisation saw them moved into the Southern League in 2006. In July 2006, Simon Lane was installed as the new manager. After rebuilding the squad from scratch, Lane guided the club into 14th place by the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season In 2009 Windsor & Eton FC won the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup, beating Marlow FC 1‚Äì0 in the final. At the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season the Royalists finished top of the Southern League Division One South and West, one point ahead of AFC Totton, thus securing automatic promotion as champions. Mounting debts meant numerous hearings in court for the club through 2010, and on 30 January 2011 the club made an official statement effectively saying that the club would cease to exist after the high court hearing on 2 February, but that they hoped to start a new club, playing at the same ground. =New club formed= Windsor F.C. was formed on 2 February 2011 by fans of the original Windsor & Eton club and accepted into the Combined Counties Football League Premier Division. Ground Early grounds at which the club played were Windsor Recreation Ground and Balloon Meadow (now part of Windsor Racecourse) before the move to the present ground at Stag Meadow in 1911. In 2003 the Isthmian League awarded the ground an 'A' grade following some frenetic building activity which saw terracing completed all the way around the ground, plus a new turnstile block and an extension to the covered terracing on the far side of the ground. Following the successful 09‚Äì10 season a team of supporters and club members turned out prepare the ground for football in the Southern Premier Division. The summer was spent roofing, weeding, painting, carpeting and completing odd jobs all around the ground to give it the face lift it required. As well work taking place to prepare the playing surface of the pitch. Notable former players Two players who turned out for Windsor during the inter-war years were Vic Woodley, who later distinguished himself in goal for Chelsea, Derby County and England, and Billy Coward, who joined QPR before moving to Walsall and playing in the famous 'giant-killing' side which beat the mighty Arsenal in the FA Cup in 1933. More recently, Morgaro Gomis, Solomon Taiwo and Gavin Tomlin played for the club. Keith Scott (footballer) played for the club and also managed the club taking them on to win the Berks and Bucks County FA cup in 08-09 and then on to win the league in 09-10. Actor Ralf Little turned out for the club on several occasion in the 05‚Äì06 season. Mosta FC Striker Victor Osobu played for the club in their championship winning year, 09-10. AFC Wimbledon goal keeper Seb Brown played for Windsor in the 07‚Äì08 season whilst on loan from Brentford FC Jermaine Gumbs ‚Äì Anguillan international footballer in 2008‚Äì09 season Mascot Windsor and Eton FC's mascot was Scotty the Stag. Scotty made his debut at Stag Meadow on 12 December 2009 during the 6‚Äì0 thrashing of Bracknell Town FC. Scotty helped raise money for charity and visited children at Wexham Park Hospital. Scotty also took part in two mascot races during the 2010‚Äì11 season.

This type of fairytale, in the French oral tradition, is often combined with motifs from the type 327A, similar to Hansel and Gretel; one such tale is The Lost Children.Delarue, Paul. The Borzoi Book of French Folk- Tales. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York, 1956, p. 365. The story was first published in English as Little Poucet in Robert Samber's 1729 translation of Perrault's book, \\"Histories, or Tales of Past Times\\". In 1764, the name of the hero was changed to Little Thumb. In 1804, William Godwin, in \\"Tabart's Collection of Popular Stories for the Nursery\\", retitled it Hop o' my Thumb, a term that was common in the 16th century, referring to a tiny person.Opie, Iona and Peter. The Classic Fairy Tales. Oxford University Press, 1974, p. 129. Summary Hop-o'-My-Thumb () is the youngest of seven children in a poor woodcutter's family. His greater wisdom compensates for his smallness of size. When the children are abandoned by their parents, he finds a variety of means to save his life and the lives of his brothers. After being threatened and pursued by an ogre, Poucet steals his magic seven-league boots while the monster is sleeping. Plot Illustration by Gustave Dor√©, from Les Contes de Perrault (1862), depicting Hop-o'-My-Thumb hiding under a stool, listening to his parents as they discuss abandoning him and his brothers. A poor woodcutter and his wife are no longer able to support their children and intend to abandon them in a forest. Hop-o'-My-Thumb, overhearing his parents, plans ahead and collects small white pebbles from a river. He uses the stones to mark a trail that enables him to successfully lead his brothers back home. However, the second time round, he uses breadcrumbs instead, which the birds eat up. The brothers are lost in the wood. Hop-o'-My-Thumb climbs up a tree and spots a distant light. The boys walk towards it. They come at last to a house, and learn that it belongs to an ogre. Hop-o'-My-Thumb, fearing the wolves, decides to take the risk of staying in the monster's residence. The ogre allows the boys to sleep for the night, and provides a bed for them in his daughters' room. But the ogre wakes up not too long after, and prepares to kill them in their slumber. Hop-o'-My-Thumb, who anticipated the possibility, already planned ahead and replaced the daughters' gold crowns with the bonnets worn by him and his brothers. As a result, the ogre kills his daughters instead, and goes back to bed. Once he is snoring, Hop-o'-My-Thumb directs his siblings out of the house. The ogre wakes up in the morning to discover his grave mistake, puts on his seven-league boots, and races after the boys. They spot the ogre while walking. Hop-o'-My-Thumb once again thinks fast and hides in a small nearby cave. The ogre, who is tired, happens to rest close to their hiding spot. Hop-o'-My-Thumb instructs his brothers to make their way home, and meanwhile, removes the boots from the sleeping ogre. He puts them on, and the boots, being magical, resize to fit him. Hop-o'-My-Thumb uses the boots to make a fortune, and returns to his family's home, where they live happily ever after. History and analysis Illustration to \\"Le petit Poucet\\" from the first edition of Perrault's book (1697), showing Hop-o'-My-Thumb pulling the sleeping ogre's boots off. The French folktale was first published by Charles Perrault as Le petit Poucet in Histoires ou contes du temps pass√© in 1697. The French name for the hero, \\"Poucet\\" /puse/, derives from the French word \\"pouce\\" /pus/, which means \\"thumb\\", \\"big toe\\", or \\"inch\\". The suffix \\"-t\\" gives it an affectionate touch, given the morphemes of the language. The beginning mentions that \\"le petit Poucet\\" was no bigger than a man's thumb when he was born. However, it seems that for the remainder of the story, the protagonist is just a small child, and the tale bears no resemblance to Tom Thumb. As is the nature of traditional stories, passed on orally, the beginning passage might be a remnant from an older tale, ancestral to both Hop-o'-My-Thumb and Tom Thumb. The first half of Hop-o'-My-Thumb is very similar to Hansel and Gretel. The woodcutter parents are no longer able to support their children and abandon them. The hero lays a trail of breadcrumbs, which thanks to the birds, does not help him get back home. Such laying of trail is found in many stories, one of the oldest being Theseus and the Minotaur. The second half of the story involves an ogre, which the hero outsmarts. It bears resemblance to Sweetheart Roland and Themisto.Opie, Iona and Peter. The Classic Fairy Tales.

A century later, architect Carlo Rossi conceived to unify the structures facing the Mikhailovsky Palace into a uniform Neoclassical ensemble. His plans were realized between 1829 and 1831 when the bridges were rebuilt and decorated with identical lamp posts and ironwork fences featuring palmettes, spears, and gorgons. Thanks to repairs undertaken in 1936, 1953 and 1999, the bridge remains in good condition, and is still open to road and foot traffic.

Kliment Ohridski‚Äú) is the oldest higher education institution in Bulgaria. Founded on 1 October 1888, the edifice of the university was constructed between 1924 and 1934 with the financial support of the brothers Evlogi Georgiev and Hristo Georgiev (whose sculptures are now featured on its fa√ßade) and has an area of 18,624 m¬≤ and a total of 324 premises. The university has 16 faculties and three departments, where over 21,000 students receive their education. The current rector is Anastas Gerdzhikov. It has been consistently ranked as the top university in Bulgaria according to national and international rankings, being constantly among the best four percent of world universities according to QS World University Rankings.  History  University students in the 1930s The university was founded on 1 October 1888‚Äîten years after the liberation of Bulgaria‚Äîto serve as Bulgaria's primary institution of higher education. Initially, it had 4 regular and 3 additional lecturers and 49 students. It was founded as a higher pedagogical course, it became a higher school after a few months and a university in 1904. The first rector was Bulgarian linguist Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan. During Sofia University's first years, it had three faculties, namely a Faculty of History and Philology (since 1888), a Faculty of Mathematics and Physics (since 1889) and a Faculty of Law (since 1892). History, geography, Slavic philology, philosophy and pedagogics, mathematics and physics, chemistry, natural sciences and law were also taught. The first women (16 in number) were welcomed to the university in 1901 and 25 November (8 December N.S.), the day of St. Kliment of Ohrid, became the university's official holiday the following year. As Prince Ferdinand opened the National Theatre in 1907, he was booed by Sofia University students, for which the university was closed for six months and all lecturers were fired. Not until a new government with Aleksandar Malinov at the head came into power in January 1908 was the crisis resolved. At the beginning of the Balkan Wars, 1,379 students (725 men and 654 women) were recorded to attend the university. A fourth faculty was established in 1917, the Faculty of Medicine, the fifth, the Faculty of Agronomy following in 1921, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and the Faculty of Theology being founded in 1923. In 1922‚Äì1923, Sofia University had 111 chairs, 205 lecturers and assistants and 2,388 students, of which 1,702 men and 686 women. The foundation stone of Sofia University's new edifice was laid on 30 June 1924. Funds were secured by the brothers Evlogi Georgiev and Hristo Georgiev. The rectorate was built according to the initial plans of the French architect Henri Br√©an√ßon, who had won a competition for the purpose in 1907. The plans were developed by Nikola Lazarov and revised by Yordan Milanov, who also directed the construction, but died before the official opening on 16 December 1934. On 27 October 1929, the first doctoral thesis in natural science of the university was defended by geologist Vassil Tzankov. The second one in chemistry followed on 1 July 1930 and the title doctor was granted to Aleksandar Spasov. In 1930‚Äì1931, the university had four more doctors. After the political changes of 9 September 1944 and the emergence of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, radical alterations were made in the university system of the country. At that time in 1944‚Äì1945, 13,627 students attended the university, taught by 182 professors and readers and 286 assistants. Communist professors were introduced to the higher ranks of university authority, with others that did not share these views being removed. Specific party-related chairs were established and the university was restricted after the Soviet model. Three new faculties were founded in 1947, one of forestry, one of zootechnics and one of economics and major changes occurred, with many departments seceding in later years to form separate institutions. Sofia University Mountains on Alexander Island, Antarctica were named for the university in commemoration of its centennial celebrated in 1988 and in appreciation of the university‚Äôs contribution to the Antarctic exploration.

He is a vampire hunter and the mentor of Blade. Screenwriter David S. Goyer created him for the 1998 film Blade (in which the part was played by Kris Kristofferson), but he first appeared on screen in Spider-Man: The Animated Series where he was voiced by Malcolm McDowell and later by Oliver Muirhead. In 2006, Abraham Whistler appeared in the Blade television show. Fictional character biography Abraham Whistler is a vampire hunter and the mentor of Blade. Abraham Whistler was once a happily married man with two daughters and a beautiful wife. He lived a normal life, and his family lived comfortably, but all of that changed one night when a drifter came, seeking dinner and place to rest for a while before continuing on his way. Whistler let the man in, only to regret that decision for the rest of his life. The drifter was a vampire, and a sadistic one at that. After torturing the family - mainly Whistler - for a while, he then tried to force Whistler to decide in which order his family would die. Whistler refused, struggling to stop the vampire from killing his wife and daughters. He was unable, and a few hours before dawn, the vampire left him with a damaged leg, other injuries, and the drained corpses of his family. Whistler dedicated himself to hunting down vampires, learning about their ways and customs, and shut himself off from the world. A few years after his family's death, he went to a bar, got drunk, and ended up sleeping with one of the locals. The next morning, he explained to her that he was on the run from a powerful organization, and she would be in danger if they found out she'd been involved with him. He left her with a name and took her number and address, just in case he needed to get in touch with her should something happen. The one night stand had a big consequence: A daughter, whom Whistler learned about not long after her birth. He almost panicked, forcing his one-time lover and daughter to move somewhere else and change their names. He was determined not to lose this new family to the vampires. Certain they were safe, Whistler then left them to fend for themselves after giving them a substantial amount of money he'd earned from stealing from the vampires and their familiars. He checked in on his new family so often but kept them largely ignorant. Several years later, Whistler met up with a young boy who he'd almost mistaken for a vampire - Eric Brooks, a half-vampire, half-human miracle. He took the Daywalker in, teaching him to use his powers and was able to create a serum to sate the bloodlust Eric suffered. The two of them became a team, Eric taking on the name Blade, and since then they have stayed together and fought the vampires as partners. In the recent years though, Whistler was diagnosed with lung cancer from his smoking, and he realized that without him, Blade would be alone. Determined Blade wouldn't have to fight the war on his own, Whistler secretly began forming a team of vampire hunters. Around the same time, Abigail Whistler showed up, having tracked down her father, determined to know the man who had left her and her mother alone while occasionally supporting them. Whistler reluctantly told her everything, only to have an even more determined girl on his hands - one that wanted to follow in his footsteps. Seeing it was useless to convince her otherwise, he put her on the team, thankful that she would at least have others with her and he would be able to check up on her. Later, Whistler was nearly beaten to death by Deacon Frost's goons and shot himself in an attempt to prevent resurrecting as a vampire. His suicide was in vain, though. He came back, only to be kidnapped by the vampires working for Eli Damaskinos, who saw Whistler as a great advantage over the Daywalker and someone who could prove useful. Kept as a prisoner and tortured regularly, Whistler was eventually saved by Blade and given a cure for the vampirism. Whistler wasn't happy about the temporary alliance between Blade and the vampires, and he sensed something between Blade and Nyssa. He also resented Scud but went along with Blade's plan. Spider-Man (1994 TV series) Screenshot from Spider-Man: The Animated Series. Abraham Whistler's background in the animated series is the same as that in the films, although he appears younger and with a much more kempt appearance than the cinematic interpretation of the character. Whistler was a vampire hunter who took on a young Blade and trained him in martial arts and as a vampire hunter. Blade, who was half-vampire himself, was given a serum developed by Whistler that would stop him from craving human plasma. When Blade hunted Morbius the Living Vampire, a young human student who was accidentally mutated into a vampire- like creature, Blade discovered the Neogenic Recombinator, which could transform humans into vampires. Whistler told him not to destroy it, as it could also be used to cure Blade of his vampirism. Morbius was eventually driven into hibernation. While Blade was hunting a vampire in Europe, Whistler was visited by the Black Cat, who was looking for help to cure Morbius. Whistler told her that the only way he knew to cure him would be to destroy him and gave her a weapon to do so, but she couldn't bring herself to do it. Movies Actor Kris Kristofferson as the character in the Blade film series. =Blade= In the first Blade film it is revealed that Whistler lost his wife and two daughters to an attack by a vampire who had arrived at their home posing as a drifter. Whistler was beaten and tortured, being forced to choose which one of his family died first. These events shaped his hatred of vampires and his mission to destroy as many as he could. Whistler is a weapons expert and master of several martial arts, having a part in creating many of Blade's weapons. When he discovered a thirteen-year-old Blade on the streets preying on the homeless, he took him under his wing. Realizing that he was half human and lacked a vampire's normal weaknesses with the exception of their thirst, he developed a serum to suppress Blade's vampiric lust for blood. Deacon Frost, an ambitious vampire whom Whistler and Blade had been tracking, located their base and attacked Whistler, causing him to be infected with vampirism. After informing Blade of Frost's plan to resurrect an ancient vampire god, Whistler then seemingly commits suicide, considering death a better fate than becoming a vampire. However, his death is not seen on camera; only the sound of a gun firing is heard. =Blade II= It is revealed in the second Blade film that Whistler survived his suicide attempt to be kidnapped by another gang of vampires and taken to the Czech Republic. After killing all but one of the vampires responsible for his imprisonment, Blade frees him from suspended animation, taking him to Prague and injecting him with the \\"cure\\". During his time with them, he was repeatedly tortured to the point of death, healed, and then tortured again. Blade, Whistler, and Scud were summoned by the Shadow Council, ruled by overlord Eli Damaskinos, to eradicate the reaper threat. Reinhardt and Chupa (played by Matt Schulze), a friend of Priest who now wishes to kill Whistler to even the score with Blade, corner Whistler, and Chupa proceeds to savagely beat him. Reinhardt leaves the two. Whistler, to save himself, releases the reaper pheromones into the air. As Chupa is about to finish him off with a gun, reapers swarm the sewers and feed on Chupa, allowing Whistler to slip away. During his escape, Whistler is confronted by Jared Nomak, the original Reaper, who lets Whistler live to reveal the truth about the Reaper strain to Blade. When Blade and Whistler are captured by Damaskinos thanks to Scud's betrayal, Whistler manages to escape after Reinhardt underestimates him, rescuing the injured Blade and taking him to a vat of blood so that Blade can be restored to full health to stop Damaskinos's forces and Nomak. =Blade: Trinity= In the third Blade film, Blade is framed for the murder of several humans (who were in fact familiars being used as bait). Blade, now in the public eye and wanted by the FBI, is hunted down. In a raid on their new hideout, Whistler set the self-destruct mechanism and seemingly died in an explosion. He is not seen or heard of afterwards (although Drake took the form of Whistler when he attacked the Nightstalkers). Whistler fathered a daughter out of wedlock or before marriage. This was Abigail Whistler, who eventually tracked down her natural father when she came of age, and asked to be trained as a vampire hunter. Whistler trained her, although he trained her separately from Blade, who was totally unaware that Whistler had any prot√©g√©s other than himself. Whistler also set up Abigail as the leader of one of the many Nightstalker units he had secretly founded. It is assumed that these units were set up because one man (or half-vampire) is not enough to destroy an entire species. Also, since Blade is not immortal (he will eventually die from old age if he is not killed in action first), Whistler did not want the war to die with him. Blade: The Series In Blade: The Series, which takes place after Blade: Trinity, the writers go further into Whistler's background. In the episode \\"Sacrifice\\", viewers learn that Whistler got his trademark limp from a young Blade, who escaped his father's house and broke Whistler's leg in an attempt to flee. Blade's father called Whistler in at the urging of a helpful policeman, and Whistler tested him to learn that he was not a regular vampire. He asked Blade's father to give him the boy to use as a weapon against vampires, but Blade ran away before a decision was made. After Blade joined and turned a street gang called the \\"Bad Bloods\\", Whistler found him and killed several members of the gang before taking Blade under his wing.

The mill, which has been restored to full working order, is a Grade II listed building and is under the ownership of the National Trust.Stainsby Mill: Hardwick Estate information at the National Trust The mill is located in the grounds of Hardwick Hall, another National Trust property. History A mill on this site appears to have existed from the early 13th century. Originally all the water for the mill came from the River Doe Lea which fed the Miller's Pond on the Hardwick estate. By 1762 the Stainsby Pond, fed by the Stainsby Brook, had been constructed and the water also fed into the Mill Pond which was situated the other side of the road from the mill. Water was allowed into the mill race by sluice gates under the road. =The current mill= By the 1840s the mill had been become dilapidated and William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire decided it needed rebuilding and re- equipping. The mill was substantially rebuilt in dressed stone from the Hardwick Estate and fitted with modern machinery, including a diameter breast shot water wheel, between 1846 and 1850. It was in operation for a century until it finally closed in 1952. Up till 1865 the millers were members of the Saunders family who had worked the mill since 1689. Subsequently the tenancy passed into the Hitch family for the rest of its working life, the last miller being William Hitch. =Preservation and restoration= As a result of the death of the 10th Duke of Devonshire in 1950, as part of the Hardwick Estate, the mill was passed to the government in lieu of death duties. It was given to the National Trust who carried out a partial restoration in 1976. As a result of a report on the mill's future by the Ault Hucknall Environment Group in 1990 a full restoration to working order was commenced in 1991 with the mill being opened to the public again in 1992.

He ruled from 1404 until 1417, when he died from an infection caused by a dog bite. William was a son of Albert I and Margaret of Brieg. Biography Holland, double groat or \\"Tuin\\", struck in Valenciennes under William of Bavaria as William VI, Count of Holland. William, allied with the Hooks, was in conflict with his father until 1394. In 1404 he succeeded him as Count of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut and duke of Bavaria-Straubing. In 1408 in the Battle of Oth√©e William and John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, and Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, defeated the citizens of Li√®ge who had revolted against William's brother John of Bavaria, the bishop of Li√®ge. As a result, he was no longer, as count of Hainaut, obliged to pay homage to the bishop. William's reign was marked by internal strife within the county of Holland. In particular, Lord John V of Arkel supported William's enemies in Holland. William conquered Arkel in 1412, at which point John accepted his defeat and Arkel was annexed by Holland. William claimed Friesland as the count of Holland. Duke William I of Bavaria-Straubing had previously sent five expeditions to conquer Friesland. Only Stavoren was captured in 1398. William II also sent expeditions to the region but Stavoren was regained by the Frisians in 1414. Prior to his death, William ensured his nobles swore allegiance to his only daughter, Jacqueline. Jacqueline was the only child by his wife Margaret of Burgundy, a daughter of Philip the Bold whom he married in 1385, at the Burgundian double wedding in Cambrai, at the same time his sister, Margaret of Bavaria, married John the Fearless. However, on William's death in 1417, a war of succession broke out between his brother John, the bishop of Li√®ge and his daughter Jacqueline of Hainaut. This would be the last episode of the Hook and Cod wars and finally place Holland and Hainaut into Burgundian hands.

The club's final season was in 2003‚Äì04 when they were relegated after losing to Coventry RFC in their final match. The club was based at College Grove in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. History =Foundation= Wakefield RFC was founded in 1901, six years after the schism in rugby that saw the formation of the Northern Union and the move of Wakefield Trinity, who had been the principal rugby club in the city, to the new code. On 15 June 1901, the Wakefield Express printed a short notice: ‚ÄúA movement is on foot to form a new rugby football club on purely amateur lines to play under Rugby Union rules, and a meeting to promote that object has been called‚Äù. One of the club's first vice presidents was former England and British Lion international Osbert Mackie. England International JW Sagar was the club's first captain and he expressed the wish that the formation of the club would provide the opportunity for the local grammar school boys to continue in the game in the city rather than having to move elsewhere. Players to benefit included Bill Guest, a former Queen Elizabeth Grammar School (QEGS) pupil between 1918 and 1922, who was to become one of the leading figures at Wakefield both as a player and administrator until his death in 1991. Silcoates School produced among others, Steve Townend, the club's second leading appearance maker and prolific point scorer, who was to join the coaching staff after finishing his playing days, eventually becoming Director of Rugby. =1920‚Äì1996= The club's first honours were in 1920, when they won the Yorkshire Cup (\\"T‚Äôowd tin pot\\") and were to win it on a further seven occasions, (1922, 1969, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994). The 1920s saw the first international capped while at Wakefield, when Dr John McDougall won three caps for Scotland to add to his caps won before the First World War while at Greenock Wanderers. The war saw the death of Frank Alford Kingswell, a member of the club's very first team at Mytholmroyd and from the start of the 1920‚Äì21 season, his brother, Billy Kingswell, made the former Outwood Church ground (renamed in memory of his brother) available to the club. This was the club's home until a move to College Grove in 1935 and they remained there until their demise in 2004. The 1930s saw two further internationals, Reg Bolton winning one cap in 1932‚Äì33 before adding to this when he moved to Harlequins and Jack Ellis, winning a solitary cap against Scotland in 1938‚Äì39, the outbreak of the Second World War cutting short his international career, although he did play in service and Red Cross internationals. In the 1950s, and 1960s, the club developed two players who were to gain International caps for England whilst playing for other clubs - Phil Taylor with Northampton and Dave Rollitt with Bristol. Bryan Barley won the first of his seven England caps in 1983‚Äì84. Barley was closely followed by Mike Harrison, who captained England in the first Rugby World Cup in 1987 and was the club's most capped player with fifteen caps, seven of which were as England captain. Graham Marshall was capped by Scotland shortly after leaving the club. Dave Scully was to become the club's only World Cup winner, when he starred for England in the first World Cup sevens tournament winning the \\"moment of the tournament\\" for a crunching tackle on Fijian Mesake Rasari. Barley, Harrison and Scully were to encapsulate the running rugby for which Wakefield had become known since their formation and this probably was one of the reasons that the club lost a substantial number of players to rugby league over the years. This led to the famous comment from Robin Foster, the club's press officer in October 1967 \\"Wakefield Trinity will run short of cash before we run out of players\\".Wakefield Express, 28 October 1967 The running game brought the club wider recognition and in 1975‚Äì76 the club was admitted to the John Player Cup for the first time and reached the semi-final, with 'giant killing' wins over Moseley and Northampton before a narrow defeat at Rosslyn Park. Jeff Dowson the club captain during this run, was nominated by Rugby Union Writers club as 'Personality of the year' and was later to play for the Barbarians. Les Cusworth, (the British club record holder of 25 drop goals in just 21 games in 1974‚Äì75), was later to play for England following a move to Leicester and Neil Bennett a county winger and prodigious try scorer, was to continue playing for the club until 1989, becoming Wakefield's leading appearance maker playing in 504 first team games and scoring 245 tries in the process. The 1970s were to see Wakefield designated a 'major club' by the RFU. On formation of the leagues in 1987 Wakefield were placed in Division 3, winning the league title in 1987‚Äì88 and remaining in Division 2 for a record fifteen seasons until relegation at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season. =Decline in the professional era= Declining attendances and a struggle to cope with professionalism led to the club to seek solutions for its long-term future. A proposed takeover by Bradford Bulls rugby league club in January 2002 amounted to nothing, although three Wakefield players (Mark Sowerby, a former England Sevens captain, Jon Feeley and Jon Skurr) helped Bradford Bulls win the Middlesex 7s in 2002. (Wakefield themselves won the plate competition at the 1996 Middlesex Sevens.) The club's final match was on 26 April 2004 against Coventry, who won the match 15‚Äì11 and with that defeat, consigned Wakefield to relegation to the third tier, the National Division 2. With relegation comes a drop in RFU payments which added to the financial problems of a trading loss of ¬£105,000 for the season and unsecured creditors' loans of approximately ¬£640,000. In a memo to the House of Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport dated 11 May 1999, the club reported \\"Wakefield RFC has since the advent of professional rugby [union] made cumulative operating losses of approximately ¬£500,000\\".Memorandum submitted by Wakefield Rugby Football Club Limited, UK Parliament, 11 May 1999 The shareholders of the club decided that they could not continue to provide the same level of funding to the club upon relegation to Division 3. Plans to sell the club's 'league place', to a consortium who wanted to move the club to Oxford, were blocked by the RFU, who also blocked similar moves to 'merge' or 'move' the club with Sale FC and Halifax. Two South African consortiums also showed interest in moving the club to London but these attempts come to nothing.\\"London Tribe eye Wakefield\\" at BBC Sports, 2 May 2004 A merger with cross-city rivals Sandal, formed in 1927 by former Wakefield player Claude Beaumont, failed to materialise. (Wakefield Cougars, an amateur side formed during the 1990s from the Wakefield fourth team, did move to Sandal for a season before ceasing to exist as an independent side in 2004‚Äì05). Just three years after celebrating its centenary the club was forced to withdraw from the league during the summer of 2004, although they remain non-playing members of the RFU and Yorkshire RFU. =Post-club days= Wakefield's memory is being kept alive, with two former players; Nick Lloyd and Dean Schofield playing the Premiership whilst Dan Scarbrough plays for Racing Metro in the French top 14 and Warren Spragg plays in the Italian Super 10 competition for Petrarca Padova. Lloyd, Scarbrough, Schofield are England Internationals whilst Spragg is an Italian International. Jonathan Pettemerides who currently plays for Singapore Cricket Club and is captain of the Cypriot national side Nigel Melville is the chief executive officer and president of rugby operations for USA Rugby while Les Cusworth is Argentina's Director of Rugby. Stuart Lancaster is head of Elite Player Development for the England Rugby Football Union and Jon Skurr is Irish Rugby Union Sevens coach. Geoff Cooke who was briefly Chief Executive of the club in the 1998/99 season was Executive Director of First Division Rugby Limited, the collective organisation who ran National League One of the English Rugby Union Clubs Championship before re- organisation of the leagues in 2009/10. Diccon Edwards is in charge of the Leeds Carnegie Academy, Jimmy Rule is Chief Executive at Hull F.C. Rugby League club, and Ryan Duckett is General Manager and Director of Operations of Bradford Bulls. Two former players are playing in the Rugby League Super League, Paul Sykes for Bradford Bulls RL and Rob Parker for Salford City Reds. Both played for Wakefield during their brief link up with Bradford Bulls.

It dates from the early nineteenth century and its developed as a result of the opening of the Aberdare Ironworks at Llwydcoed in 1800. Background and history The settlement was originally known as Heol-y-Felin (translated as Mill Street) due its location on the road to Llwydcoed Mill. This name was still in use in 1855 when Heolyfelin Chapel was established. The name Trecynon was adopted around 1860 after a competition was held at a local eisteddfod competition to decide upon a name for the village. In 1811, the Robertstown Tramway Bridge, was built over the river Cynon, linking Heolyfelin and Robertstown. It is the oldest of its kind in the world.Engineering timeline: Robertstown Tramway Bridge. Accessed 11 October 2013 Until 1800 there was only one house at Heol-y-Felin, next to Hen-Dy-Cwrdd Unitarian Chapel, built in 1751. As the iron industry attracted migrants to the Aberdare District there was an increased demand for housing, and, as a result Heol-y- Felin began to grow. Many of the earliest houses in were built along the main road from Aberdare to Hirwaun. By the 1860s Heol-y-Felin had become one of the main population centres in the parish of Aberdare Parish,and Harriet Street, Ebenezer Street, Alma Street, Mount Pleasant Street and Margaret Street were all built in this period. Such rapid and intensive development inevitably led to public health problems, as were revealed in 1853 when Thomas Webster Rammell prepared a report for the general Board of Health on the condition of public health in Aberdare. Heol-y-Felin was not considered the worst case in the district by any means but there wereconcerns. John Griffith, Vicar of Aberdare, reported that: Likewise, local industrialist Rees Hopkin Rhys reported: Rammell's report led directly to the formation of the Aberdare Local Board of Health the following year. The Local Board, which later became the Aberdare Urban District Council was responsible for a range of local improvements in Aberdare, including the opening of Aberdare Park in 1869. Population continued to grow steadily in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, as a result of the steam coal trade. In August 1902 the foundation stone of the Trecynon Public Hall and Library was laid by Lord Windsor and D. A. Thomas, M.P. Funds for the construction of the Hall came from a variety of sources, including the Carnegie Fund and local coalowners. The hall was officially opened on 10 March 1903 when a grand concert was organised. The Coliseum Theatre was opened on 17 September 1938. Industry The Aberdare Ironworks at Llwydcoed was the main employer in the early industrial period. The Ironworks closed in 1875 and thereafter coal became the main source of employment. Education In 1848 the Aberdare British Schools (Ysgol-y-Comin) were built on an unenclosed area of Hirwaun Common and in 1896 the Aberdare Intermediate School was built on the Southern edge of Trecynon, to become Aberdare Boys County School from 1913. Religion St Fagan's Church The earliest building in Trecynon was Hen Dy Cwrdd Chapel the oldest Nonconformist chapel in the Cynon Valley. Hen Dy Cwrdd Chapel was founded in 1751 and rebuilt in 1862. The chapel had two notable ministers during the nineteenth century. Thomas Evans (Tomos Glyn Cothi), minister from 1811 until 1833 was a political radical who was a pioneer in the political reform movement. His replacement John Jones, minister from 1833 until 1863 was also a radical and was one of the founders of the magazine Yr Ymofynnydd, which he used to publish his radical ideals. Unitarians cared less for their buildings than other nonconformist denominations who built increasingly grandiose edifices such as Calfaria, Aberdare. When the new building was opened in 1862, John Jones refused to hold a special service of consecration, as he considered such a service was too suggestive of 'popery'. Although the building still survives, the chapel closed in the mid 1990s due to a declining congregation. It is hoped that an alternative use will be found for the chapel building in the future. No services are held at the chapel nowadays, but the building remains as a protected Grade II listed building. St Fagan's Church is one of the oldest churches in the Aberdare district and was built in the 1854 when John Griffith was vicar of Aberdare. It was built to serve the needs of the growing Anglican congregation in the upper Cynon Valley. The church was paid for by Harriet Windsor-Clive, Baroness Windsor and, when the church burnt down in 1856, was rebuilt again at her expense.\\"Death Of The Baroness Windsor\\", The Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian, 13 November 1869, p.5 Each of the major nonconformist denominations established chapels at Trecynon. Ebenezer was one of the oldest Independent chapels in the locality. Heolyfelin was established in 1855 as a branch of the Baptist church at Hirwaun. Carmel was a Calvinistic Methodist chapel, as was Bryn Seion in Mill Street, Today The most prominent local attraction and landmark is Aberdare Park, a popular public Victorian era park which was opened in 1869 on a site. The Aberdare College campus site of Coleg Morgannwg is situated within the northern part of the village, on Cwmdare Road. Aberdare Boys' Grammar School was opened in Trecynon in 1896 as 'Aberdare Intermediate School' for both boys and girls - the girls leaving in 1913 for their own new school at Plasdraw. The boys' school relocated to Cwmdare Road in 1964 and ceased to be a grammar school in 1978 when it became the new Aberdare Boys' Comprehensive School, but changed its name to Aberdare High School in 2009, and closed in the summer of 2014. Comin Infant school and Comin Junior School are located within the village. Both school sites are physically connected.

Other early housing was built at Miner's Row, Founder's Row and Scales Houses. The names of these streets betray their early origins; the Scale family were among the founders of the works and remained partners until 1846. Red Cow Pub In the second half of the 19th century a new period of growth was instigated by the development of the coal industry in the area. Matthew Wayne Esq. of the Gadlys Ironworks opened the Dyllas Colliery in 1840 and in 1849 Ysguborwen Colliery was sunk by Samuel Thomas and Thomas Joseph. Among the houses built in this period were those at Moriah Place, Horeb Terrace and Grey's Place. Exhibition Row was built in 1851 and was named Exhibition Row in honour of the Great Exhibition held at Crystal Palace that year. Industry The Aberdare Ironworks were established at Llwydcoed in the early nineteenth century and in 1823 were taken over by Rowland Fothergill. Owenrship later passed to his nephew, Richard. Eight public houses were open in Llwydcoed at this time. They were The Earl Grey, Fox and Hounds, Red Cow, Corner House, The Mason's, Miner's Arms, the Dynevor Arms and the Croes Bychan. At that time stop tap was midnight and a local essayist recounts the boisterous nature of the revelries. \\"It is said that more beer was lost (wasted) when the furnaces, coal mines and iron-ore undertakings were being worked, especially at the start of the month, and on pay Saturday Night, than is being drunk now.\\" (Unknown Author.

The village's history is intertwined with coal-mining, and since the decline of the industry in the 1980s, it has become primarily a commuter base for the larger surrounding towns of Aberdare and Merthyr Tydfil and Pontypridd, as well as the cities of Cardiff and Swansea.  Name  The village's name translates to \\"Dare Valley\\". The Dare () is tributary that flows down from the Darren mountain, down through the village and on to Aberdare (literally \\"Mouth Of The Dare\\"), where it joins the larger River Cynon, one of the largest tributaries of the River Taff.  History  Before the exploitation of the South Wales Coalfield, Cwmdare was a scattering of a few houses and farms. However, in the 1850s with the Industrial Revolution fuelling the demand for coal, several deep coal mines were constructed in the area, and workers began to migrate there from other parts of Wales, as well as the South West of England. The influx of miners naturally necessitated the construction of housing to support them, and between 1853 and 1859, the first streets were laid down on the west side of the Dare Valley, which would become the centre of the village of Cwmdare. At the same time, a small collection of houses were constructed on the east side of the valley, near the Merthyr Dare Colliery, known as Pithead. As the collieries grew over the next century, Cwmdare grew with it, with rows of terraced miner's cottages being built to the north-west of the original hamlet to create homes for the expanding workforce. Cwmdare had four large collieries in operation during its history, all of which had closed by 1977. The Cwmdare, Merthyr Dare and Bwllfa Dare collieries were all sunk in the 1850s, while work began on Nantmelyn Colliery in 1860. Over the next 120 years, the seams in the Maerdy mountain were gradually used up, with Merthyr Dare closing in 1884, Cwmdare in 1936, Nantmelin in 1957, and finally Bwllfa Dare in 1977.  Post-mining changes  Following the closure of the mines and the decline of coal mining in South Wales, Cwmdare has evolved into a residential satellite of nearby Aberdare, as well as Merthyr Tydfil, Cardiff and Swansea. There are almost no jobs in Cwmdare itself, so most residents commute to one of the larger towns for work. Due to the redevelopment of the Dare Valley area in the 1970s, Cwmdare has become an attractive commuter village due to its proximity to both of Wales' major urban centres, Cardiff and Swansea, good transport links, and the attractive scenery. As a result, an explosion of new-build housing has seen the population expand exponentially, covering most of the east side of the Dare Valley, almost down to the river Dare itself.  Local amenities  Despite its increased population, Cwmdare has few local amenities, and most residents rely on nearby Aberdare for most things. It does however have a local shop, post office, and a pub, The Ton Glwyd Fawr Inn on the village square. In addition, as a reflection of the strong history of Nonconformism in South Wales mining areas, it has several chapels - Nebo, Elim, Gobaith and the Cwmdare Mission, as well as the Church In Wales St Luke's Church. Cwmdare is also home to a variety of local schools, the oldest of which is Cwmdare Primary School, a respected English-language primary school that teaches around 260 pupils from the ages of 4-11. In addition to this is Maesgwyn School, a school for pupils aged 11‚Äì19 with moderate learning difficulties, and Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Aberd√¢r ‚Äì a Welsh- language primary school that serves the upper Cynon Valley.  Dare Valley Country Park  : In 1970, following the closure of all but one of Cwmdare's deep coal mines, it was decided that the landscape, on the west side of the valley, having been destroyed by the mining industry for more than a century, should be returned to its original state. For the next two years coal and slag tips were cleared, the River Dare was re-routed and the small mining hamlet of Pithead was demolished and two artificial lakes were created. In 1973, the work was completed, and Dare Valley Country Park was opened to the public. It comprises 500 acres (2.0 km2) of woodlands, pasture and moorland mountainside. Paths and bridges make the area popular with walkers, families and dog- walkers, while those with an interest in industrial history can still find evidence of the area's mining past dotted about the landscape, including an old pit wheel, erected as a monument at the site of the Bwllfa Dare pit. In 1985 a visitor's centre and camp site was built near the site of the old Merthyr Dare colliery ‚Äì it features a cafe, campsite and 15 visitor rooms, as well as an exhibition that tells the story of Cwmdare's industrial and natural heritage.

Biography Born in Corfu, he was the son of Major- General Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby, an Anglo-Irish nobleman who was a senior commander in the British Army. He entered the army on 27 December 1842 as an ensign in the 49th Regiment of Foot. Transferred to the Grenadier Guards, he became a lieutenant on 16 February 1844, captain on 18 July 1848, and major on 19 October 1849. From 1847 to 1858 he was aide-de-camp to Lord Clarendon and Lord St. Germans, successively lord-lieutenants of Ireland. He served through the Crimean campaigns of 1855‚Äì1856, becoming lieutenant-colonel on 31 Aug. 1855; for the action before Sebastopol he received a medal with clasp, the Turkish medal, and the Order of the Medjidie, 3rd Class. After the peace he was appointed equerry to Albert, Prince Consort, who greatly valued his services. On 2 August 1860 he became colonel, and in 1862, after the death of the prince, he was sent to Canada in command of a battalion of the Grenadier Guards which was stationed in the colony during the American Civil War. On 6 March 1868 he became a major-general. Ponsonby embellished letters to his children at Eton with a series of illustrations in which he concealed the school's address. It was a family quirk continued by his son, Arthur Ponsonby, and recently revived by descendant Harriet Russell. His letters bore addresses appearing as doodled signposts in snowstorms or as huge envelopes shouldered by tiny people. He served as Keeper of the Privy Purse and Private Secretary to Queen Victoria. His appointment occurred on 8 April 1870, after the death of prior Private Secretary General Sir Charles Grey, who was \\"a son of Earl Grey, the Prime Minister\\" at the time and who was wife Mary Ponsonby's \\"Uncle Charles.\\"Arthur Ponsonby.

It is named after Bulgarian writers Petko and Pencho Slaveykov, father and son. A sculpture of the two sitting on a bench is one of its main landmarks. A square called Kafene Ba≈üi is first mentioned to have existed at the modern place in 1515. A coffeehouse, a mosque, and two Turkish police stations were situated there. In the 17th century, the square was an important crossroad stretching from modern Sveta Nedelya Square to Vitosha Boulevard and featured a fountain. After the liberation of Bulgaria, the square was extended, and many one- and two-story houses with gardens were erected on the site, one of which belonged to Petko Slaveykov, whose name the square later took. Bookstalls on the square During the 1920s and 1930s, Slaveykov Square formed its modern appearance, with five- to seven-storey buildings featuring a shop on the ground floor. The first significant constructions appeared in this period ‚Äî the Teachers' Fund (1924). the Ministry of Public Works (1928), and the French Institute (1934). After 1944, the automobile traffic around the square was gradually limited, and it turned into a pedestrian area.

In 1921 he was the founding editor of Broom, an international literary and art magazine, which was first published in New York City before he moved the venture to Europe. Loeb published two novels while living in Paris in the 1920s, and additional works after returning to New York in 1929. Early life, education, marriage and the Great War Harold Albert Loeb was born into a wealthy ethnic German Jewish family in New York City. His mother Rose was a member of the Guggenheim family; one of his cousins was Peggy Guggenheim. His father Albert was a successful investment banker with Kuhn, Loeb & Company. The young Loeb attended Princeton University, where he earned his B.A. in 1913. After earning his degree, he moved to Empress, Alberta, Canada, working on a ranch and later laying concrete for the Canadian Pacific Railway.Sarason, 1980, p. 251 In 1914, Loeb returned to New York, where he married Marjorie Content, daughter of a wealthy stockbroker and his wife. They returned to a rural life in Alberta for a period, where their son and daughter were born in 1915 and 1916, respectively.Sarason, 1980, p. 251 The United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany made it impossible for Loeb to continue working as a foreigner in Canada. In 1917, the family returned to New York.Sarason, 1980, p. 251 The next year, Loeb moved to San Francisco, where he worked for the Guggenheims as a purchaser for the American Smelting and Refining Company. When the United States entered the war, Loeb joined the military. Due to poor eyesight, he was not sent overseas and assigned to a desk job in New York.Kondritzer, 1984, p. 4; Sarason 1980, p. 251 Sunwise Turn Bookstore and Broom After the war, Loeb became partial owner in New York of the bookstore The Sunwise Turn. While working at the Sunwise Turn, he met several young writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Laurence Vail, and Malcolm Cowley. He also met his future business partners Alfred Kreymborg and Lola Ridge. They started their office for Broom in the basement of Loeb's wife's brownstone. In 1921, Loeb convinced Kreymborg to become a joint partner and publish Broom magazine. Loeb sold his share of the Sunwise Turn bookstore and moved to Rome to begin publication of the magazine in Europe. Loeb separated from Marjorie Content in 1921, and their divorce was completed in 1923. Editorial vision In the May 1922 issue of Broom, Loeb published his essay, \\"Foreign Exchange,\\" which defined his editorial vision.Sarason, 1980, p. 253 After this, Loeb began publishing more American writers, including John Dos Passos, Laurence Vail, E.E. Cummings, Gorham Munson, Robert Coates and Matthew Josephson.Sarason, 1980, p. 253 In September 1922, Loeb published the article, \\"The Mysticism of Money.\\" In October 1922, Loeb announced the magazine's move to Berlin, a center of artistic activity in Europe. In March 1923, Loeb left Broom and moved to Paris to work on his own writing. Paris While in Paris, Loeb spent time with numerous American expatriates, writers and artists, including Ernest Hemingway. He had a brief affair with Duff, Lady Twysden. Hemingway later used them as inspiration for the characters of Robert Cohn and Lady Brett Ashley in his roman √† clef, The Sun Also Rises. In his 1959 memoir, Loeb later wrote about this period, and of being involved in boxing and bullfights with Hemingway. Loeb published his first two novels, Doodab (1925) and The Professors Like Vodka (1927) while living in Paris. He continued to write, publishing his third novel Tumbling Mustard in 1929, the year that he returned to New York City. Later years Loeb published two non-fiction books in the 1930s, addressing the United States' political and social issues during the Great Depression. He published a memoir, The Way It Was (1959). In the 1960s, he published essays about writers Ford Madox Ford and Hemingway, and about their times in Paris. He also wrote a review of Carlos Baker's 1969 biography of Hemingway. In 1969, he edited an anthology of work published originally in Broom. Loeb married and divorced three more times after his marriage to Marjorie Content. In addition to his brief affair with Duff Twysden, he was involved with Kathleen Eaton Cannell.

The most significant indicator is its extremely expensive real estate. Seoul as a whole is known for its expensive housing prices‚Äîas of 2011, its average apartment cost approximately US$5,500 per m2‚Äîbut the average price in Gangnam is almost twice as high, roughly US$10,000 per m2, which is 3.5 times the nationwide average. As for land value, the mere 40 km2 land of Gangnam district rivals with the entire land value of the city of Busan, the second-largest city in South Korea. Combined with the neighboring districts of Seocho and Songpa, the Greater Gangnam Area accounts for almost 10% of the land value of the entire country. While Seoul's traditional business centers such as Central District, Jongno District, Yongsan District and Yeongdeungpo District still maintain their leading roles, Gangnam and its neighboring districts have fast become the new core across all areas of business over the last few decades.

Thakin Chit Maung (; 1915 ‚Äì 3 March 2005), also known as Widuya Thakin Chit Maung, was a veteran Burmese politician. Political career His political career in Burma (also called Myanmar) began as a teenager in the early 1930s when he joined the nationalist organisation, Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association). He participated in the anti-British campaign led by General Aung San (father of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi) and fought against the Japanese during World War II. In 1950, Chit Maung helped established the Burma Workers and Peasants Party, nicknamed the \\"Red Socialists\\",. As there is another Burmese politician Thakin Chit Maung of the same name and as both of them took the appellation 'Thakin', 'Master' - this Thakin Chit Maung is known by the additional acronym mentioned usually before his name: 'Widura'. Hence Widura Thakin Chit Maung. Widura Thakin Chit Maung earned this additional name around February 1959 after he gave a speech in the then Burmese Parliament. In his speech Thakin Chit Maung compared the travails of the Burmese people during the caretaker administration of General Ne Win with the travails that the embryo ('would-be') Buddha had gone through in the Buddha's previous existence as the Minister Widura which were depicted in The Jataka Tales. Thakin Chit Maung's speech in Parliament was broadcast live on radio at that time and soon thereafter he gained the appellation or honorific of 'Widura Thakin Chit Maung'. Thakin Chit Maung who was then a member of Parliament representing the leftist National United Front (not to be confused with National Unity Party of the renamed Burma Socialist Programme Party formed in late September 1988) opposed the then proposed amendment to Section 116 of the 1947 Burmese Constitution which would allow General Ne Win to continue to serve as 'care taker Prime Minister' (Section 116 of the 1947 Burmese Constitution stated in effect that no person who is not a member of Parliament shall serve as a Minister or Prime Minister for more than six months. General Ne Win was not a member of Parliament and since by February 1959 he had served as Prime Minister for nearly six months there were moves to amend the Constitution in order for General Ne Win to continue to serve as caretaker Prime Minister. The Constitution was amended and General Ne Win's caretaker government held multiparty elections in February 1960. The Clean Faction of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) led by U Nu won the 1960 elections by a landslide and General Ne Win handed back power to U Nu.) The other Burmese politician Thakin Chit Maung is known by the name of his home town Myanaung and hence Thakin Chit Maung (Myanaung). Both Thakin Chit Maung (Widura) and Thakin Chit Maung (Myanaung) were members of the Internal Unity Advisory Board (IUAB) informally known as the 'Thirty-three' since there were 33 members in the Board. The late General Ne Win, then Chairman of the Union Revolutionary Council (also known as RC) that has taken over power through a military coup on 2 March 1962 formed the IUAB on 2 December 1968 and the Board was to report its suggestions to the RC by 31 May 1969 to enhance 'national unity'. Thakin Chit Maung also formed the Democratic Front for National Reconstruction in the 1980s and joined the Veteran Politicians Group in the late 1980s. The Veteran Politicians Group later sent open letters to Burma's then military ruler, Senior General Than Shwe, urging the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and for national reconciliation talks to take place between the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the various ethnic groups throughout the country. Thakin Chit Maung died at the age of 90 in Rangoon on 3 March 2005.

Rhodesia After brief service in the ranks with the regular British Army's Intelligence Corps, then the Corps' Territorial Army airborne unit, and the civil staff of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner's Office at New Scotland Yard in the 1960s, Bemister started his journalism career with the politically liberal Rhodesia Herald and Sunday Mail newspaper group in pre-independence Rhodesia before joining the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation and its television subsidiary, RTV in Salisbury as a news sub-editor. He also contributed to the later banned African nationalist newspaper Moto. New Zealand and Australia In 1974, he moved to New Zealand and worked as a general reporter for the tabloid NZ Truth, known in the early 1970s for its expos√© journalism and investigative reporting. He then immigrated to Australia where he joined Rupert Murdoch's News Limited newspaper titles: The Truth (formerly Melbourne's investigative tabloid, allegedly generating substantial profits, which contributed to Murdoch's acquisition of the British News of the World), the Sydney Sunday Telegraph, and the national daily, The Australian. He returned to the broadcast media with the Australian Broadcasting Commission in both Melbourne and Sydney and the Australian Ten Television Network as Special Investigative Producer in Sydney. Television As an independent television journalist, Bemister's first film was The Confessions of Ronald Biggs, a documentary about the fugitive British train robber Ronald Biggs, who was then living in Brazil. Bemister's co-produced 90-minute film The Hunter and the Hunted, about Nazi war criminals, their whereabouts, and the Nazi hunters who sought their arrest and prosecution, was commissioned by the Australian Seven Network and filmed on location in South America, France, Germany, Israel and the UK. Included in the film were scenes identifying the then home in La Paz, Bolivia, of Klaus Barbie, former head of the Gestapo in Lyon, France, and the first confirmation by a Bolivian law officer of Barbie‚Äôs true identity.Guardian newspaper obituary Tuesday, 6 January 2009 Barbie had been living under the alias Klaus Altmann, and while the Paris Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld had identified him in Bolivia in 1971, the government there had always refused requests to extradite him to France. In a filmed interview with Bemister, La Paz District Attorney Gaston Ladesma admitted that Altmann had confessed to him that he was Klaus Barbie. On 19 January 1983, 14 months after The Hunter and the Hunted was telecast on network television in the United States that a new moderate government in Bolivia deported Barbie to France to stand trial. The film also contained the only filmed interview of SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Walter Rauff (who has been called \\"arguably the most wanted Nazi fugitive then alive\\"). In 1979, Bemister traced Rauff to a small bungalow in a suburb of the Chilean capital, Santiago, near a house occupied by his son and grandchildren. A few hours later Bemister found himself on the wrong side of a jammed garden gate to the son's house as the former SS Standartenf√ºhrer Walter Rauff sought entry from the street, while a nearby surveillance camera team filmed the whole encounter. Unaware of Bemister's hidden microphone, Rauff gave his only filmed interview, joking about Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal: \\"We are all old (presumably referring to other Nazis) and failing him in clients\\". Adolf Eichmann's son Horst also controversially discusses the case against his father in the film. A 58-minute version of the film was later telecast on PBS in the United States for which Bemister won the 1981 Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Journalism on U.S. Network Television and the 1982 CINE Golden Eagle Award. Bemister's other international producer credits include Philby on Thames Television in Britain, Moscow's Man for Sveriges Television, WDR- Fernsehen in Germany, and the Discovery Channel worldwide; and the Home Box Office documentary special America Undercover: The Search for Dr Josef Mengele for which he worked as Producer-Correspondent. He was also Investigative Reporter for Fremantle Media's The Seven Million Dollar Fugitive. His productions for Australian television networks include a two-hour feature documentary, Spy Trap, telecast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; the one-hour documentary special Psychic Visions Of The Future, a cynical look at the world's alleged psychics for the Australian Ten Television Network, and Warriors Of The Deep, a docudrama about the Japanese midget submarine attack into the heart of Sydney Harbor in 1942, then the base for American and Australian warships. This film was telecast by the Australian Seven Network. Cinema feature project In 2008, Bemister embarked on the production of a 120-minute 'cross genre' factual feature film entitled Admissible Evidence, which planned to incorporate cinematographic and photographic evidence, satellite mapping of crime loci, ground penetrating radar, electronic and human intelligence, and other forensic evidence to identify World War II (Great Patriotic War) German war criminals and their collaborators, including members of the Romanian Army and Police. The project planned to incorporate evidence of some scientists in face, gait, and voice recognition from the United States, Sweden and Germany, and investigators 'cold case' Nazi war crimes committed between 1938 and 1945, including new evidence of murders of Jewish babies and burning of live victims in quicklime; such crimes were to be exposed for the first time, together with admissible evidence concerning each case. The technologies, where possible, would have also identified Nazi victims: principally Jews, but also Slavs, Roma, homosexuals, psychiatric patients, pacifists including Quakers, Red Army prisoners-of-war, and unarmed civilians. To redress cases where many thousands of alleged war criminals were not prosecuted, the film was to present forensic 'nano-evidence'. The film, a German, Russian, and UK co-production with the participation of other European organisations, was scheduled for production in 2009, and was the recipient of UK National Lottery Funding, through a grant from the British Government‚Äôs Department of the Media, the UK Film Council, and Screen South. The picture was to abandon the conventional British documentary format in favor of $4 million production values and the style of a forensic/detective procedural drama with four-camera cinematography, innovative mis-en-scene and lighting, the most advanced visual effects - commonly used in big budget adventure features - and rapid editing. It was not planned that the film would address armed partisan actions, but was to side-bar Soviet NKVD war crimes, the very few war crimes committed by the Allies, and as a postscript, review the cases of organizations, scientific academics, and reactionary historians who attempted to 'red flag' the production. The future of the project is uncertain since Bemister's death. Other biography In 2007, his work featured in Richard Trank‚Äôs documentary I Have Never Forgotten You: The Life & Legacy of Simon Wiesenthal. More recently, with American, German, and Swedish colleagues, he carried out studies into experimental forensic technologies for Admissible Evidence. Bemister was a life member of the Oxford University Film Foundation, and a member of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, New York, and the Frontline Club, London. He was also an Associate Member of the Oxford University Society. He was educated at St George‚Äôs College, Weybridge, England, and received the Undergraduate Diploma in Film Studies at the University of Oxford. Throughout his life, Bemister suffered from intermittent bipolar disorder. He helped to establish the \\"Equilibrium\\" foundation, which promotes research about the condition. He was married briefly in 1995.

Hira·πáyagarbha (Sanskrit: ‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡§É ; literally the 'golden womb' or 'golden egg', poetically translated as 'universal womb') is the source of the creation of universe or the manifested cosmos in Vedic philosophy, as well as an avatar of Vishnu in the Bhagavata Purana.Hiranyagarbha britannica.com. It finds mention in one hymn of the Rigveda (RV 10.121), known as the Hira·πáyagarbha S≈´kta, suggesting a single creator deity (verse 8: ', Griffith: \\"He is the God of gods, and none beside him.\\"), identified in the hymn as PrajƒÅpati. The concept of the \\"golden womb\\" is first mentioned in the Vishvakarma S≈´kta (RV 10.82.5,6) which picturized the \\"primeval womb\\" as being rested set upon the navel of Vishvakarman the Supreme cosmic creator, that One wherein abide all things existing. This imagery was later transferred to Vishnu. The Upanishad calls it the Soul of the Universe or Brahman,The Philosophy of the Upanishads, by Paul Deussen, Alfred Shenington Geden. Published by T. & T. Clark, 1906. Page 198. and elaborates that Hira·πáyagarbha floated around in emptiness and the darkness of the non-existence for about a year, and then broke into two halves which formed the Svarga and the P·πõthvi. In classical PurƒÅ·πáic Hinduism, Hira·πáyagarbha is the term used in the Vedanta for the \\"creator\\". Hira·πáyagarbha is also BrahmƒÅ, so called because it is said he was born from a golden egg (Manu Sm·πõti 1.9), while the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata calls it the Manifest.The MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, Book 12: Santi Parva. Kisari Mohan Ganguli, tr. Section CCCIII The Mahabharata. Some classical yoga traditions consider Hira·πáyagarbha as the originator of yoga, though this may also be a name for Rishi Kapila. Creation Matsya PurƒÅ·πáa (2.25-30) gives an account of initial creation. After MahƒÅprƒÅlaya, the great dissolution of the Universe, there was darkness everywhere. Everything was in a state of sleep. There was nothing, either moving or static. Then Svayambhu, self-manifested Being arose, which is a form beyond senses. It created the primordial waters first and established the seed of creation into it. The seed turned into a golden womb, Hira·πáyagarbha. Then Svayambhu entered in the egg. The NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa S≈´kta exclaims that everything that is, visible or invisible, all this is pervaded by NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa within and without. The ƒ™≈õvara Upani·π£ad says that the universe is pervaded by ƒ™≈õvara (God), who is both within and without it. He is the moving and the unmoving, He is far and near, He is within all these and without all these. The VedƒÅnta S≈´tra further states that Brahman is That from Whom this Universe proceeds, in Whom it subsists, and to Whom, in the end, it returns. The Sa·πÉkhya school holds that there are only two primary principles, Puru·π£a and PrƒÅk·πõti, and creation is only a manifestation or evolution of the constituents of PrƒÅk·πõti due to the action of Puru·π£a's Consciousness. The Bhagavata states that NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa alone was in the beginning, who was the pious of principles of creation, sustenance, and dissolution (also known as the Hindu Trinity of BrahmƒÅ, Vi·π£·πáu and Shiva) - the Supreme Hari, multi-headed, multi-eyed, multi-footed, multi-armed, multi- limbed. This was the Supreme Seed of all creation, subtler than the subtlest, greater than the greatest, larger than the largest, and more magnificent than even the best of all things, more powerful, than even the wind and all the gods, more resplendent than the Sun and the Moon, and more internal than even the mind and the intellect. He is the Creator, the Supreme. The term can also mean as He who, having become first the Creator, has come to be considered as the womb of all objects. Hira·πáyagarbha S≈´kta The Hira·πáyagarbha S≈´kta of the Rigveda declares that God manifested Himself in the beginning as the Creator of the Universe, encompassing all things, including everything within Himself, the collective totality, as it were, of the whole of creation, animating it as the Supreme Intelligence. =Sanskrit Verse= ‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡§É ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡•á ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§É ‡§™‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•á‡§ï‡§æ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§ ‡•§ ‡§∏ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡•É‡§•‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§§‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡••'' hira·πáyagarbha·∏• samavartatƒÅgre bh≈´tasya jƒÅta·∏• patirekƒÅsƒ´ta  sa dƒÅdhƒÅra p·πõthvƒ´·πÉ dhyƒÅmutemƒÅ·πÉ kasmai devƒÅyahavi·π£ƒÅ vidhema  ‡§Ø ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§¨‡§≤‡§¶‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ ‡§â‡§™‡§æ‡§∏‡§§‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§É ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§õ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ω‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§É ‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡•• ya ƒÅtmadƒÅ baladƒÅ yasya vi≈õva upƒÅsate pra≈õi·π£a·πÉ yasyadevƒÅ·∏•  yasya chƒÅyƒÅm·πõta·πÉ yasya martyu·∏• kasmai devƒÅyahavi·π£ƒÅ vidhema  ‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡•à‡§ï ‡§á‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ ‡§ú‡§ó‡§§‡•ã ‡§¨‡§≠‡•Ç‡§µ ‡•§ ‡§Ø ‡§à‡§∂‡•á ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§¶‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§§‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§™‡§¶‡§É ‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡•• ya·∏• prƒÅ·πáato nimi·π£ato mahitvaika idrƒÅjƒÅ jagato babh≈´va  ya ƒ´≈õe asya dvipada≈õcatu·π£pada·∏• kasmai devƒÅya havi·π£ƒÅvidhema  ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§Æ‡•á ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§∞‡§∏‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∏‡§π‡§æ‡§π‡•Å‡§É ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§É ‡§™‡§∞‡§¶‡§ø‡§∂‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§¨‡§æ‡§π‡•Ç ‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡•• yasyeme himavanto mahitvƒÅ yasya samudra·πÉ rasayƒÅ sahƒÅhu·∏•  yasyemƒÅ·∏• paradi≈õo yasya bƒÅh≈´ kasmai devƒÅya havi·π£ƒÅvidhema  ‡§Ø‡•á‡§® ‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡•å‡§∞‡•Å‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ ‡§™‡•É‡§•‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä ‡§ö ‡§¶‡•É‡§¢‡§æ ‡§Ø‡•á‡§® ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§≠‡§ø‡§§‡§Ç ‡§Ø‡•á‡§®‡§®‡§æ‡§ï‡§É ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á ‡§∞‡§ú‡§∏‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§É ‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡•• yena dayaurugrƒÅ parthivƒ´ ca dar·∏ªhƒÅ yena sava satabhita·πÉ yenanƒÅka·∏•  yo antarik·π£e rajaso vimƒÅna·∏• kasmai devƒÅyahavi·π£ƒÅ vidhema  ‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§∏‡§æ ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§≠‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§Ö‡§≠‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡•á‡§ú‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞ ‡§â‡§¶‡§ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡•• ya·πÉ karandasƒ´ avasƒÅ tastabhƒÅne abhyaik·π£etƒÅ·πÉ manasƒÅrejamƒÅne  yatrƒÅdhi s≈´ra udito vibhƒÅti kasmai devƒÅyahavi·π£ƒÅ vidhema  ‡§Ü‡§™‡•ã ‡§π ‡§Ø‡§¶ ‡§¨‡§∞‡•ç‡§π‡§§‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§® ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§ú‡§®‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§∞‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ ‡•§ ‡§§‡§§‡•ã ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡•á‡§ï‡§É‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡•• ƒÅpo ha yada barhatƒ´rvi≈õvamƒÅyana garbha·πÉ dadhƒÅnƒÅjanayantƒ´ragnima  tato devƒÅnƒÅ·πÉ samavartatƒÅsureka·∏•kasmai devƒÅya havi·π£ƒÅ vidhema  ‡§Ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§¶‡§æ‡§™‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¶ ‡§¶‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§ú‡§®‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§Æ ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•á‡§∑‡•ç‡§µ‡§ß‡§ø ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡•• ya≈õcidƒÅpo mahinƒÅ paryapa≈õyada dak·π£a·πÉ dadhƒÅnƒÅjanayantƒ´ryaj√±ama  yo deve·π£vadhi deva eka ƒÅsƒ´ta kasmaidevƒÅya havi·π£ƒÅ vidhema  ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§®‡•ã ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡•Ä‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§Ç‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ú‡§ú‡§æ‡§® ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ ‡§¨‡§∞‡•ç‡§π‡§§‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•à ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§π‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ß‡•á‡§Æ ‡•• mƒÅ no hi·πÉsƒ´jjanitƒÅ ya·∏• parthivyƒÅ yo vƒÅ diva·πÉsatyadharmƒÅ jajƒÅna  ya≈õcƒÅpa≈õcandrƒÅ barhatƒ´rjajƒÅnakasmai devƒÅya havi·π£ƒÅ vidhema  ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§æ‡§™‡§§‡•á ‡§®‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨‡§≠‡•Ç‡§µ ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§ú‡•Å‡§π‡•Å‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§µ‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§™‡§§‡§Ø‡•ã‡§∞‡§Ø‡•Ä‡§£‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç ‡•• parajƒÅpate na tavadetƒÅnyanyo vi≈õvƒÅ jƒÅtƒÅni pari tƒÅbabh≈´va  yatkƒÅmƒÅste juhumastana no astu vaya·πÉ sayƒÅma patayorayƒ´·πáƒÅma  =Translation in English= In the beginning was the Divinity in his splendour, manifested as the sole Lord of land, skies, water, space and that beneath and He upheld the earth and the heavens.

The port features prominently in the China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) plan, and is considered to be a link between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Maritime Silk Road projects. It is about southwest of Turbat, and to the east of Chabahar Port in Iran's Sistan and Balochistan Province. Gwadar's potential to be a deep water sea port was first noted in 1954, while the city was still under Omani suzerainty. Plans for construction of the port were not realised until 2007, when the port was inaugurated by Parvez Musharraf after four years of construction, at a cost of $248 million. In 2015, it was announced that the city and port would be further developed under CPEC at a cost of $1.62 billion, with the aim of linking northern Pakistan and western China to the deep water seaport. The port will also be the site of a floating liquefied natural gas facility that will be built as part of the larger $2.5 billion Gwadar-Nawabshah segment of the Iran‚ÄìPakistan gas pipeline project. Construction began in June 2016 on the Gwadar Special Economic Zone, which is being built on 2,292 acre site adjacent to Gwadar's port. In late 2015, the port was officially leased to China for 43 years, until 2059. Gwadar Port became formally operational on 14 November 2016, when it was inaugurated by Pakistan's Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif; the first convoy was seen off by the then Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, General Raheel Sharif. On 14 January 2020, Pakistan operationalized Gwadar Port for Afghan transit trade.  Location  Gwadar near the Iran‚ÄìPakistan border Gwadar Port is located in southwestern Pakistan near the Iranian border. SoP, 1965) Gwadar Port is situated on the shores of the Arabian Sea in the city of Gwadar, located in the Pakistani province of Balochistan. The port is located 533 km from Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, and is approximately 120 km from the Iranian border. It is located away from Oman, and near key oil shipping lanes from the Persian Gulf. The greater surrounding region is home to around two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves. It is also the nearest warm-water seaport to the landlocked, but hydrocarbon rich, Central Asian Republics, as well as Afghanistan. The port is situated on a rocky outcropping in the Arabian sea that forms part of a natural hammerhead-shaped peninsula protruding out from the Pakistani coastline. The peninsula, known as the Gwadar Promentory, consists of rocky outcropping reaching an altitude of 560 feet with a width of 2.5 miles that are connected to the Pakistani shore by a narrow and sandy 12 kilometre long isthmus. The isthmus separates the shallow Padi Zirr bay to the west, from the deep water Demi Zirr harbour in the east.  Background  Pakistan identified Gwadar as a port site as far back as 1954 when Gwadar was still under Omani rule. Pakistan's interest in Gwadar started when, in 1954, it engaged the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct a survey of its coastline. The USGS deputed the surveyor, Worth Condrick, for the survey, who identified Gwadar as a suitable site for a seaport. After four years of negotiations, Pakistan purchased the Gwadar enclave from Oman for US$3 million on 8 September 1958 and Gwadar officially became part of Pakistan on 8 December 1958, after 200 years of Omani rule. A small wharf at Gwadar was completed in 1992, and formal proposals for a deep sea port at Gwadar were unveiled a year later in 1993. The federal government approved the construction of the port in December 1995 but the project could not get started because of shortage of funds. In 1997, a government-appointed task force identified Gwadar as one of the focus area of development, but the project did not launch due to economic sanctions imposed against Pakistan following its nuclear tests in May 1998. Construction on Phase 1 of the project began in 2002 after the agreement for its construction was signed during the state visit of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji in 2001. After completion of Phase 1 in 2007, the first commercial cargo vessel to dock at the port was the \\"Pos Glory,\\" with 70,000 Metric Tonnes of Wheat on 15 March 2008.  Construction  Gwadar Port is being developed in two phases: Phase I covered building of three multipurpose berths and related port infrastructure and port handling equipment, and was completed in December 2006, but inaugurated on 20 March 2007. =Phase I (2002‚Äì2006)= The first phase of construction at Gwadar Port began in 2002, and was completed in 2006, before inauguration in 2007. * Berths: 3 Multipurpose Berths * Length of Berths: 602 m in total * Approach Channel: 4.5 km long dredged to 12.5 m depth and max draft (hull) of channel.(capacity: bulk carriers of 30,000 deadweight tonnage [DWT] and container vessels of 25,000 DWT) * Turning basin: 450 m diameter * Service Berth: One 100 m Service Berth * Related port infrastructure and handling equipment, pilot boats, tugs, survey vessels, etc. * Built at a cost of $248 million. =Phase II= The second phase of construction is currently underway as part of planned improvements under CPEC and other ancillary projects. The total project is expected to cost $1.02 billion. In Sep 2018, the Pakistan Senate expressed concern at slow rate of progress of most projects of Phase II at Gwadar as construction had not started for most projects. Ongoing: * Approach Channel: To be dredged to 14.5 m depth and max draft (hull) of channel * 6 lane East Bay Expressway to connect the port to the Makran Coastal Highway * New international airport to be built in vicinity of the port * Desalination plant * 300 megawatt coal-fired power plant Planned: * 4 Container Berths along 3.2 kilometres of shoreline * 1 Bulk Cargo Terminal (capacity: 100,000 DWT ships) * 1 Grain Terminal * 1 Ro-Ro Terminal * 2 Oil Terminals (capacity: 200,000 DWT ships each) * Floating liquefied natural gas terminal with capacity of 500 million cubic feet of gas per day * 2,292 acre special economic zone to be developed adjacent to port =Longer term plans= * Dredging of approach channel to depth of 20 meters * 100 berths to be built by 2045 * Capacity to handle 400 million tons of cargo per year Expansion under CPEC The Western Alignment of CPEC is depicted by the red line. The 1,153 kilometre route will link the M1 Motorway near Islamabad with Gwadar Port. The Western Alignment will also connect to the Karakoram Highway, which is being rebuilt and overhauled as part of CPEC to provide improved access to Gilgit Baltistan and the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor plan, the state-owned China Overseas Port Holding Company (COPHC) will expand Gwadar Port with construction of nine new multipurpose berths on 3.2 kilometres of seafront to the east of the existing multipurpose berths. COPHC will also build cargo terminals in the 12 kilometres of land to the north and northwest of the site along the shoreline of the Demi Zirr bay. In total, COPHC has awarded $1.02 billion worth of contracts for expansion of the port. In addition to construction of nine berths and cargo terminals, plans for expanded port infrastructure also include several projects that will be financed by loans extended by Chinese state owned banks. The Gwadar Port dredging project will deepen approach channels to a depth of 14 meters from the current 11.5-meter depth, at a cost of $27 million. Dredging will enable docking of larger ships with a deadweight tonnage of up to 70,000 at Gwadar Port, while current capacity permits a maximum 20,000 DWT. Future plans call for dredging of the harbour to a depth of 20 meters to allow for docking of larger vessels. Also included as part of the CPEC infrastructure development package for port infrastructure is a $130 million breakwater around the port. Ancillary infrastructure projects for the port will also be built as part of CPEC. A $114 million desalination plant will be developed to provide potable water to the city, while the Government of Pakistan will also contribute $35 million towards infrastructure projects in the Gwadar Special Economic Zone. A 19 kilometre-long dual carriageway known as the Gwadar East Bay Expressway will also be built at a cost of $140 million to connect Gwadar Port to the existing Makran Coastal Highway and the planned $230 million Gwadar International Airport. A floating liquefied natural gas facility that will have a capacity of 500 million cubic feet of liquified natural gas per day will also be built at the port as part of the $2.5 billion Gwadar-Nawabshah segment of the Iran‚ÄìPakistan gas pipeline, which is being built as a joint venture between Pakistan's Inter State Gas System, and the China National Petroleum Corporation. The Pakistani government also intends to establish a training institute named Pak-China Technical and Vocational Institute at Gwadar which is to be completed at the cost of 943 million rupees to impart skills to local residents to train them to operate machinery at the port. It was expected that by 2017, the port will handle over one million tons of cargo, most of which will consist of construction materials for other CPEC projects. COPHC plans to eventually expand the port's capacity to 400 million tons of cargo per year. Long terms plans for Gwadar Port call for a total of 100 berths to be built by 2045. In Sep 2018 the Ministry of Maritime of Pakistan submitted a report in Senate that during the last five years, 99 ships loaded with cargo from seven different countries anchored at Gwadar Port. The weight of shipments was 1.439 million tons. =Financing= The government of China in August 2015 announced that the previously announced concessionary loans for several projects in Gwadar totalling $757 million would be converted 0% interest loans for which Pakistan will only be required to repay the principal value. The projects which are now to financed by the 0% interest loans include: the construction of the $140 million East Bay Expressway project, installation of breakwaters in Gwadar which will cost $130 million, a $360 million coal power plant in Gwadar, a $27 million project to dredge berths in Gwadar harbour, and a $100 million 300-bed hospital in Gwadar. In September 2015, the government of China also announced that the $230 million Gwadar International Airport project would no longer be financed by loans, but would instead be constructed by grants which the government of Pakistan will not be required to repay. Gwadar Special Economic Zone The expanded port will be located near a 2,282 acre free trade area in Gwadar which is being modelled on the lines of the Special Economic Zones of China. The swathe of land was handed to the China Overseas Port Holding Company in November 2015 as part of a 43-year lease, while construction of the project began on 20 June 2016. The special economic zone is expected to employ approximately 40,000 people, with possibility for future expansion. The special economic zone will include manufacturing zones, logistics hubs, warehouses, and display centres. Business established in the special economic zone will be exempt from Pakistani income, sales, and federal excise taxes for 23 years. Contractors and subcontractors associated with China Overseas Port Holding Company will be exempt from such taxes for 20 years, while a 40-year tax holiday will be granted for imports of equipment, materials, plants, machinery, appliances and accessories that are to be for construction of Gwadar Port and special economic zone. The special economic zone will be completed in three phases. By 2025, it is envisaged that manufacturing and processing industries will be developed, while further expansion of the zone is intended to be complete by 2030. On 10 April 2016, talking to The Washington Post, Zhang Baozhong, chairman of China Overseas Port Holding Company said that his company could spend a total of $4.5 billion on roads, power, hotels and other infrastructure for the industrial zone, which he said would be open to non-Chinese companies. The company also plans to build an international airport and power plant for Gwadar. Saudi Arabia has promised to build US$10 billion oil refinery at Gwadar Port in 2019. Operations Gwadar Port is owned by the government-owned Gwadar Port Authority and operated by China Overseas Port Holding Company (COPHC), a state-run Chinese firm. Prior to COPHC, the port was operated by the Port of Singapore Authority. =Port of Singapore Authority (2007‚Äì2013)= Following the completion of Phase I, the Government of Pakistan in February 2007 signed a 40-year agreement with PSA International for development and operation of the port, and an adjacent 584 acre special economic zone. PSA International was the highest bidder for the Gwadar Port, after its competitor DP World withdrew from the bidding process. PSA was granted a wide range of tax concessions, including exemption from corporate tax for 20 years, land for a special economic zone, duty-free imports of materials and equipment for construction and operations of the port, and duty-free shipping and bunker oil for 40 years. In addition to these incentives, the provincial government of Balochistan was also asked to exempt PSA International from the levy of provincial and district taxes. According to the agreement with PSA, the Government of Pakistan was to get a fixed 9% share of the revenue from cargo and maritime services, in addition to 15% of revenues earned from the adjacent special economic zone. In September 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported that Gwadar was being underused as commercial port, and that Pakistan had asked the Chinese government to assume operations of the port. PSA also reportedly sought to withdraw from its contract with the Pakistani Government, and expressed willingness to sell its share in the project to a Chinese firm after the Pakistani Navy failed to transfer land required for development of the planned 584 acre free trade zone. PSA also did not invest the agreed $550 million into the port, on account of the poor security situation in Balochistan in the period between 2007 and 2013. The government of Pakistan also failed to invest in requisite infrastructure works. The Supreme Court of Pakistan further issued a stay order against the allotment of land to PSA on account of a public petition. =China Overseas Port Holding Company (2013‚Äìpresent)= On 18 February 2013, Pakistan awarded a contract for construction and operation of Gwadar Port to a Chinese state- owned enterprise. As per details of the contract, the port would remain as property of Pakistan, but would be operated by the state-run Chinese firm ‚Äì China Overseas Port Holding Company (COPHC). The contract signing ceremony was held on 18 February 2013 in Islamabad, and was attended by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, Chinese Ambassador Liu Jian, as well as various federal ministers and members of parliament, as well as senior government officials. The ceremony was also marked the transfer of the concession agreement from the PSA to the COPHC. As per this agreement, 91% of the revenue generated by Gwadar Port will go to COPHC and 9% to Gwadar Port Authority. In March 2019, the Pakistani Senate was informed that during last three years, total gross revenue of Rs 358.151 million had been generated from Gwadar Port, out of which the share going to Gwadar Port Authority was Rs 32.324 million. Geopolitical impact =Gwadar Port as a means to circumvent the Straits of Malacca= The Straits of Malacca provide China with its shortest maritime access to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Approximately 80% of its Middle Eastern and African energy imports also pass through the Straits of Malacca. As the world's biggest oil importer, energy security is a key concern for China while current sea routes used to import Middle Eastern and African oil are frequently patrolled by the United States Navy. The sea-route via the Straits of Malacca is roughly , while the distance from Gwadar Port to Xinjiang province is approximately , and another from Xinjiang to China's eastern coast. However, the cost of moving oil overland is far greater. An oil pipeline from Gwadar to China's population centers (not yet built), will cost up to $8/barrel, while the cost of shipping oil from the Persian Gulf to China is $2‚Äì3/barrel. In the event that China were to face hostile actions from a state or non-state actor, energy imports through the Straits of Malacca could be halted, which in turn would paralyse the Chinese economy in a scenario that is frequently referred to as the \\"Malacca Dilemma\\". In addition to vulnerabilities it faces in the Straits of Malacca region, China is heavily dependent upon sea-routes that pass through the South China Sea, near the disputed Spratly Islands and Paracel Islands, which are currently a source of tension between China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and the United States.See South China Sea dispute for more context. The CPEC project will allow Chinese energy imports to circumvent these contentious areas. The Sino- Myanmar pipelines have also been constructed by China to address this so- called \\"Malacca Dilemma\\". In addition to China's potential weaknesses against the U.S. Navy, potential vulnerabilities could stem from a decline in China‚ÄìIndia relations. The Indian Navy has recently increased maritime surveillance of the Straits of Malacca region from its base on Great Nicobar Island. India has expressed fears of a Chinese \\"String of Pearls\\" encircling it.Blasko, Dennis J. and M. Taylor Fravel. \\"'Much Ado About The Sansha Garrison.\\" , \\"The Diplomat\\", 23 August 2012. Retrieved 4 May 2013 Were conflict to erupt, India could potentially impede Chinese imports through the straits. Indian maritime surveillance in the Andaman Sea could possibly enhance Chinese interest in Pakistan's Gwadar Port. The Kyaukpyu Port, which is currently being developed in Myanmar by the Chinese government as another alternate route around the Straits of Malacca, will likely be vulnerable to similar advances by the Indian Navy. The proposed Bangladesh-China-India- Myanmar Corridor (BCIM) would also be vulnerable to Indian advances against China in the event of conflict, thereby potentially limiting the BCIM Corridor's usefulness to China's energy security, and thereby increasing Chinese interest in CPEC. =Improved access to western China= Planned investments in Gwadar Port as part of CPEC will improve connectivity to the restive Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, thereby increasing the region's potential to attract public and private investment. The CPEC is considered central to China‚ÄìPakistan relations; its central importance is reflected by China's inclusion of the project as part of its 13th five-year development plan. The Gwadar Port project will also complement China's Western Development plan, which includes not only Xinjiang, but also the neighbouring regions of Tibet and Qinghai. In addition to its significance to reduce Chinese dependence on the Sea of Malacca and South China Sea routes, the port of Gwadar will provide China an alternative and shorter route for energy imports from the Middle East, thereby reducing shipping costs and transit times. The currently available sea-route to China is roughly , while the distance from Gwadar Port to Xinjiang province is approximately , and another from Xinjiang to China's eastern coast. As a result of the CPEC, Chinese imports and exports to the Middle East, Africa, and Europe would require much shorter shipment times and distances. =A new transit hub for the Central Asian Republics= Upon completion of CPEC-related infrastructure projects, transit times between Kashgar, China and Pakistan's Gwadar Port will be greatly reduced. This will in turn will also reduce transit times to the Kyrgyzstan and hydrocarbon-rich Kazakhstan through already existing overland routes. The Chinese government has already upgraded the road linking Kashgar to Osh, Kyrgyzstan via the Kyrgyz town of Erkeshtam while a railway between √úr√ºmqi, China and Almaty, Kazakhstan has also been completed as part of China's One Belt One Road initiative. Numerous land crossings already exist between Kazakhstan and China as well. Additionally, the Chinese government has announced plans to lay railway track from Tashkent, Uzbekistan towards Kyrgyzstan with onwards connections to China and Pakistan's coast. The heads of various Central Asian republics have expressed their desire to connect their infrastructure networks to the CPEC project and Gwadar Port via China. During the August 2015 visit of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Kazakhstan, the Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov, conveyed Kazakhstan's desire to link its road network to the CPEC project, which will also provide Kazakhstan with access to the port. During the November 2015 visit of Tajikistan's President Emomali Rahmon to Pakistan, the Tajik premier also expressed his government's desire to join the Quadrilateral Agreement on Traffic in Transit to use CPEC and Gwadar Port as a conduit for imports and exports to Tajikistan by circumventing Afghanistan. The request received political backing by the Pakistani Prime Minister. The Pamir Highway in Central Asia already provides Tajikistan access to Kashgar via the Kulma Pass. These crossings complement the CPEC project to provide Central Asian states access to Pakistan's seaports in Gwadar and Karachi by completely bypassing Afghanistan ‚Äì a country which has been ravaged by civil war and political instability since the late 1970s. =Comparison to Chabahar Port projects= In May 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Iranian counterpart President Hassan Rouhani signed a series of twelve agreements in Tehran in a boon to India‚ÄìIran relations. By these agreements, India Ports Global Pvt. Limited will refurbish a 640-meter long container handling facility, and reconstruct a 600-meter long berth at the Port of Chabahar, as well as modernise ancillary infrastructure at the berths. Improvements at the port are intended to allow Indian goods to be exported to Iran, with the possibility of onward connections to Afghanistan and Central Asia. A section of the Indian media described it as \\"a counter to the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor,\\" although the total monetary value of projects has been noted to be significantly less than that of US$46 billion CPEC project, evaluated at worth about $500 million. Indian financial commitments in Chabahar As part of the twelve memoranda of understanding signed by Indian and Iranian delegations as per text released by India's Ministry of External Affairs, India Ports Global signed a contract with Iran's Arya Banader to refurbish and reconstruct two existing berths at the port, at a cost of $85 million over the course of 18 months. The berth project represents the only direct investment in port infrastructure mentioned in the May 2016 agreements.Refer to list of MoUs ‚Äì no other project directly related to Chabahar Port is mentioned Chabahar was developed in 1972 as the oceanic port in Iran, and already features ten berths as of 2016, with a capacity to dock vessels of 80,000 deadweight tonnage. As part of the agreements, India will also offer a $150 million line of credit extended by the Exim Bank of India for future port development, India further agreed to extend a $400 million line of credit to be used for the import of steel for the construction of a rail link between Chabahar and Zahedan, while India's IRCON and Iran's CDTIC signed a memorandum of understanding for the possible construction and financing of the Chabahar to Zahedan rail line at a cost of $1.6 billion. Chinese financial commitments in Gwadar China has not offered Pakistan any line of credit for CPEC infrastructure development in the same manner as India has for Iran.No reference to credit lines is to be found in list of MoUs As part of CPEC, China has instead has committed $1.153 billion to finance construction projects and development of the port and adjacent sites.See below: List of projects $230million for Gwadar Airport, $114m desalination plant, $35m for SEZ infrastructure, $360m for coal plant, $140m for East Bay Expressway, $100m for hospital, $130m for breakwaters, $27m for dredging. Sum of figures = $987million Chinese commitments in Gwadar as part of the CPEC project include: the construction of the $140 million East Bay Expressway project to connect the port with the Makran Coastal Highway, installation of breakwaters at Gwadar port which will cost $130 million, a $360 million coal power plant adjacent to Gwadar Port, a $27 million project to dredge berths in Gwadar harbour, and a $100 million 300-bed hospital in Gwadar. A $114 million desalination plant will also be developed to provide potable water, while $35 million worth of infrastructure projects around the special economic zone will also be built. China will also grant Pakistan $230 million to construct a new international airport in Gwadar which is to be operational by December 2017. A floating liquefied natural gas facility will also be built at Gwadar Port as part of the $2.5 billion Gwadar-Nawabshah segment of the Iran‚ÄìPakistan gas pipeline. In addition to investments directly under the aegis of CPEC, the China Overseas Port Holdings Company also initiated $2 billion worth of additional infrastructure projects at the adjacent Gwadar Special Economic Zone on 20 June 2016. COPHC will also expand Gwadar Port with construction of multipurpose berths on of seafront to the east of the existing multipurpose berths. COPHC will additionally build cargo terminals in the of land to the north and northwest of the site along the shoreline of the Demi Zirr bay. Iranian and Pakistani responses to Chabahar development plans After signing the Chabahar agreement, Iran's ambassador to Pakistan, Mehdi Honerdoost, stated that the agreement was \\"not finished,\\" and that Iran would welcome the inclusion of both Pakistan and China in the project. While clarifying that Chabahar Port would not be a rival or enemy to Pakistan's Gwadar Port, he further stated that Pakistan and China had both been invited to contribute to the project before India, but neither China nor Pakistan had expressed interest in joining. Pakistani analysts have endorsed the view that Chabahar is not a competitor, stating that Gwadar has an advantage by being a deep sea port and the expansion of Chabahar would in fact expand trade through Gwadar. Larger vessels that cannot dock at Chabahar could dock at Gwadar and the cargo transshipped to Chabahar.Aamir Latif, Iran's Chabahar won't vie with Pakistan's Gwadar: Experts , Andalou Agency, 1 June 2016. However, Pakistan's military commentators have characterised the alliance between India, Iran, and Afghanistan as a \\"security threat to Pakistan\\", and it had \\"ominous and far- reaching implications\\" to the region. Pakistan's foreign policy advisor Sartaj Aziz has further signalled that Pakistan may link the Gwadar port to Chabahar via rail.\\"Pakistan may link Gwadar to India-funded Chabahar in Iran, says Sartaj Aziz\\" , Daily Pakistan, 27 May 2016. Future environmental impact Some have expressed concerns on the future of the environment of the region in light of the Gwadar port's expansion. A report of the LEAD Fellows' Study Group on the Oil Spill (SGOS) alleges that a port expansion would lead to future damage on the maritime environment such as oil spills and other human industrial waste pouring into the sea, also alleging that Pakistan's laws on maritime pollution have weak penalties and lack of institutional responsibility. This sentiment was shared by Syed Fazl-E-Haider. In his publication in Pakistan and the Gulf Economist, Haider put forth the argument that the sea water on the Baloch coast was pollution free due to the lack of human presence and activity. But ever since the commence of commercial operations in the port, all this will result in environmental consequences. In the jointly written book with Barbara E. Curry, Humpback Dolphins (Sousa spp.): Current Status and Conservation, Part 1 of Advances in Marine Biology, PhD marine biologist, Thomas A. Jefferson outlines some of the environmental consequences suffered by the Balochistan coast. He discusses the problem of sewage waste and solid waste affecting the coast including that of Gwadar. He argues that a thorough natural habitat assessment and regulation of fisheries is a solution to this growing environmental problem.

History Spotland was originally known as St Clement's Playing Fields, after the nearby St Clement's Church. Having previously been used for cricket, it became the home of St Clement's Rugby Club in 1878, until they disbanded in 1897. As well as staging local rugby competitions, the ground briefly hosted two short-lived football clubs ‚Äì the original Rochdale A.F.C. from 1900 to 1901 and Rochdale Town from 1902 to 1903, but both folded. The present Rochdale A.F.C. was then formed to use the ground in 1907, later buying the freehold for ¬£1,700 in 1914. By the time the club joined the Football League in 1921, a low wooden grandstand had been built on the south side of the ground, once the location of the cricket pavilion. Also by this time, the name of the surrounding area of the town, Spotland, had been adopted as the ground's name. In August 2016, Rochdale A.F.C. renamed Spotland Stadium the Crown Oil Arena as part of a sponsorship deal by the Bury-based fuel company Crown Oil. In 2018, due to the winter weather the pitch got into such a bad state that a number of games had to be postponed. Subsequently Rochdale were drawn against Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup and the Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino was quoted ‚Äúnot a pitch in a condition to play football‚Äù after seeing some pictures leading Rochdale to relay the surface in time for their game. Structure and facilities The ground has four stands: the Co- Operative Stand (or Main Stand), the Thwaites Beer Stand (the Sandy Lane End), the T.D.S. Stand (Pearl Street End) and the Westrose Leisure Stand (the Willbutts Lane Stand). All are fully seated, apart from the Sandy Lane End, which is a small terrace behind one of the goals. Other uses Spotland Stadium Apart from local football and rugby league, Spotland has in the past been used to host minor nations rugby league matches, such as British Amateur Rugby League Association (British Amateur Rugby League Association) matches, and also the National League Cup finals of 2003 and 2004. =Rugby League World Cup= Spotland Stadium was selected as a venue for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup hosting a match between Fiji and Ireland. This was the first time that Rochdale has staged an event in a World Cup in any sport. The event was sold out with almost 9,000 people attending, setting what was incorrectly claimed to be a new stadium record, even though Rochdale AFC had 24,231 for an FA Cup tie v Notts County in December 1949 and three higher crowds for FA Cup and play-off games between 1990 and 2008 against Northampton, Coventry and Darlington.

Kaunda reacted swiftly; on 4 February 1972, he made the specious accusation that Kapwepwe was an instrument of the White Rhodesian, South African and Portuguese governments; Kapwepwe and 122 of his followers were arrested and the UPP was banned. Before the end of the year a one-party state was proclaimed, and Kaunda felt sure enough of his power to free Kapwepwe on 31 December. Kapwepwe retired from politics and only appeared briefly in 1978, when he and Harry Nkumbula stood for Zambia's one-party presidential nomination against Kaunda.

Grigoriev was also interested in the Russian countryside, its peasants and village life. From 1916 to 1918 he created a series of paintings and graphic works, Russia (Raseja, ), depicting the poverty and strength of rural Russia. The album started with Grigoriev's poem To her stepsons. The album won a praise from influential art-critic Alexandre Benois. According to Benois, Grigoriev had shown the very essence of Russia in the period before the revolutionary upheaval. The leaderless workshop he organised in September 1919 led to the creation of the Society of Young Artists.

It is listed as a critically endangered species due to habitat loss and hunting. It is the only member of the genus Aproteles. Due to its imperiled status, it is identified by the Alliance for Zero Extinction as a species in danger of imminent extinction. Etymology The genus name (\\"Aproteles\\") ‚Äì \\"incomplete at the front\\" (Greek), is a reference to the lack of lower incisors; the species name (\\"bulmerae\\") was assigned for Susan Bulmer, the archaeologist who excavated the site from which the original fossils were recovered. Description One adult female Bulmer's fruit bat weighed 600 g (1.3 lb). Bulmer's fruit bat is a cave-dweller that occurs in mid-montane forests. Its altitudinal range is at least 1800 to 2400 m (5800‚Äì7900 ft). It is probably an obligate frugivore. It occurs in cave-dwelling colonies. Distribution and habitat Bulmer's fruit bat is a cave-dweller that occurs in mid-montane forests. It has been found living in a cave at 2300 m elevation. Its altitudinal range is at least 1800 ‚Äì 2400 m. It occurs in the Maoke Range Alpine Heathlands Global 200 Ecoregion Bulmer's fruit bat was first described from 12,000-year-old fossils found in the central highlands in Chimbu Province, Papua New Guinea. It may have become extinct there about 9000 years ago. In 1975, it was discovered in the Hindenburg Wall area of Western Province, Papua New Guinea, in a cave known as Luplupwintem. At that time, local inhabitants described the bat as being abundant, perhaps numbering thousands of bats. However, two years later, the colony had been decimated, apparently by hunters who entered the cave with shotguns and store-bought ropes. During the 1980s, no bats were seen and it was feared that the species may have become extinct. However, by 1993 a colony of about 160 bats was known to be living in the same cave. The species existed in the Telefomin region of Sandaun Province, Papua New Guinea, as recently as 1984. The only other populations reported from recent times are from the vicinity of Herowana in Eastern Highlands Province and from the vicinity of Crater Mountain in Chimbu Province, both in Papua New Guinea Ecology Bulmer's fruit bat lives in cave-dwelling colonies. It is not sexually active by the beginning of its second year and probably does not breed until its third year. Births occur in April. A newborn Bulmer's fruit bat is carried for the first few weeks of its life by its mother while she forages. Based on dental structures and its close relationship to other fruit-eating bats, Bulmer's fruit bat is probably an obligate frugivore. Its diet includes figs. Conservation Hunting and human disturbance are the probable causes of its recent decline. The colony at Luplupwintem Cave had traditionally been protected by the native people of the area, but an inflow of outside cash in the mid-1970s led to the purchase of caving equipment and guns and to the decimation of the bat colony. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation. The species is currently classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN.

The result was the creation of the Noddy series for young children, still a major property for animators half a century later. The conscious intention to create a Disney-style sympathetic focus character -- a European Mickey Mouse -- was reportedly a major factor. Beek's death in 1953 was no obstacle to the further progress of the several series of Noddy books. Peter Wienk worked alongside Beek on the Noddy books and from 1953-1970 Wienk did many illustrations for the Noddy books and Noddy Big books. There was yet another Dutch illustrator who worked on some of Blyton's other books, Willy Schermel√©.www.lambiek.net Eileen Soper (1905‚Äì1990) illustrated around 50 Blyton books, including the whole Famous Five series. In the 1970s her illustrations for the Famous Five books were replaced with more contemporary ones by Betty Maxey. Dorothy M. Wheeler (1891-1966) was the English artist who illustrated the original editions of five entire series: \\"The Magic Faraway Tree\\" series, the \\"Josie Click and Bun\\" series, the \\"Mr Pink-Whistle\\" series, the \\"Mr Tumpy\\" series (in strip book form) and the \\"O'Clock Tales\\" short story compilations. She also illustrated \\"Bumpy and His Bus\\" and \\"The Little Tree House\\". Johan Groenveld (1924-2011) illustrated the Dutch version of The Castle of Adventure (1946). He is known in The Netherlands and abroad as an illustrator, cartoonist and cartographer. Betty Ladler (1914‚Äì2004) provided illustrations for Third Holiday Book (1948), Tenth Holiday Book (1955), Eleventh Holiday Book (1956) and Enid Blyton's Magazine (1955). Kathleen I. Nixon (1894‚Äì1988) provided illustrations for numerous stories by Enid Blyton. The interior illustrations of The Enid Blyton Book of Bunnies ( 1925 ) published by Newnes is attributed to her. Pierre Probst (1913‚Äì2007) was a French artist who collaborated intensely with Blyton for a few years in the 1950s, on a series of books for Collins. He is known in France for other creations. Benjamin Rabier (1864‚Äì1939),www.horay-editeut.fr one of the patriarchs of the French comic book and creator of La vache qui rit, worked on the 1936 title The Famous Jimmy.

The population in 2011 was 439,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 14.56 km¬≤. History The Church of Church of Our Lord of Socorro () The name Labruja came from the Portuguese word laboriosa, after the name of the mountain range where it is located; laboriosa means laborious in English. The ancient settlement dates back to the primordial history of Portugal which, although may not have existed during the Roman era, was a village during the Goth civilization. Historically, the settlement grew from the 9th century village, that became a centre of a Benedictine monastery, founded by Herm√≥igio, bishop of Tui. Labruja was a vicarage of the S√© of Braga, and also, at one time, the archdeaconship of the S√© of Tui. The Benedictine monastery of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o de Labruja, was founded by the Bishop of Tui, Hermo√≠gio, who ordered its construction on local lands (Bandeira) under the reign of the monarch Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n. This king later donated the monastery to the S√© in Lugo, in 915. In 1125, Teresa transferred this title to the S√© in Tui. During the division of ecclesiastical lands on 1 December 1156, the churches of Cep√µes, Rendufe and half of Romarig√£es was transferred to the administration of Tui. In 1242, Lucas, Bishop of Tui, created the archdeaconship of Labruja, with its seat in the S√© and administration at S√£o Crist√≥v√£o de Labruja. During the Inquiri√ß√µes (inventory/inqueries) of 1258, the monastery became part of the Royal Padroado. The Sanctuary of Our Lord of Help/Aid (), was the centre of religious pilgrimages during the 13th century, and was remodelled in 1773, in addition to further renovations in successive years. Lubrija was on the road to Santiago de Compostela, along the famous Saint James's Way, crossed by the faithful. The monastery was closed in 1460, and by 1520, the local census (written by Diogo de Sousa) identified that the monastery was reduced to merely a parochial church. It was founded after the foral of S√£o Martinho, bestowed by King Manuel I of Portugal on 2 June 1515. In 1546, Archbishop Manuel de Sousa, evaluated the monastery and annex in 70,000 r√©is. Friar Baltasar Limpo, in 1580, identified Labruja as an ecclesiastical parish, and annexed the community of S√£o Tiago de Romarig√£es. Geography The civil parish is located in the Serra de Labruja, nine kilometres from the municipal seat of Ponte de Lima, occupying one of the largest tracts in the municipality. But regardless, the parish has less than 750 inhabitants interspersed within several localities (with dozens of homes in each), including: Antas, Arco, Bacelos, Balada, Bandeira, Bargo, Bou√ßa, Camboa, Carvalho, Casa Branca, Code√ßal, Devesa, Espinheiro, Fij√¥, G√°via, Igreja, Mota, Outeiro, Pessegueiros, Pedrelo, Pinheiro, Pombinha, Ponte Nova, Quinta, Revolta, Rua, Santana, Soutinho, Torre, Valinhos, Vinh√≥ de Baixo and Vinh√≥ de Cima. Its neighbours include Cunha and Romarig√£es to the north (in the municipality of Paredes de Coura); Arcozelo to the south; Rendufe, B√°rrio and Cep√µes to the east; and Cabra√ß√£o to the west. Municipal services are limited in the region: by 2011, canalized water distribution was not yet universal; sewage treatment was non-existent; and the collection of waste only served 80% of the community (twice weekly). Educational services are limited to two primary-level schools ( and EB1 de Soutinho), only one with refectory, while there are no local medical services (healthcare is handled in the municipal seat). Cultural services include a sports complex, an open library and a local community hall (used by local cultural groups for annual events). Economy The primary economic activities in this area are subsistence agriculture, farming and bee-keeping, in addition to saw-milling and nascent commercial businesses. There are also artisanl industries such as textiles and embroidery, in addition to woolen quilts, that hark back to the traditional communities that occupied the valley. Other sectors are limited by the municipal plan, a lack of industrial zones, and limited access. The parish is served by primarily by local roads, as the E1-IP1 (A3 Auto-Estrada Porto- Valen√ßa) motorway bypasses the village, and the secondary N201 (while meandering through the parish) is also some distance from the rural community. Public transport is limited to bus service and local taxis. Architecture Although limited, the parish attempts to promote a tourist economy, through the preservation of many of its architectural treasures: =Civic= * Bridge of Arquinho (), dating to the 13th-14th century, this Romanesque single-arch bridge crosses the Labruga River. * Pillory of Ponte de Lima () * Tower of Pa√ßo do Beiral () =Religious= * Church of Senhor do Socorro (), which celebrated an annual festival on first Sunday and Saturdays in July; The ample temple and front court, is surrounded by a wall, and accessible from a staircase flanked by angels blowing trumpets. The verandas of balusters are decorated with stone flames, while the staircase is enhanced by allegorical statues of stone, intermingled with vases and flames. The fa√ßade of the church is flanked by two bell-towers designed in the Rococo-style. On the cornices are royal arms, while below them and above the main doorway is a window flanked by niches with the statues of Saint Peter, and presumably Pope Clement XIV. Apart from its ornate 18th century chapel, choir and pulpits in the Neoclassical-style, the interior is simple. Behind the temple is a building used to house pilgrims on their visits to Santiago de Compostela. * Chapel of S√£o Jo√£o da Grova () * Chapel of Santa Catarina () * Chapel of Santa Ana () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Neves () * Chapel of Po√ßa () * Chapel of S√£o Domingos () * Church of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o () Along the route to Santiago do Compostela, there are still vestiges of the rock ovens used by pilgrims to cook goat on the journey. Culture Most social events, apart from religious events, are motivated by the cultural groups: the Associa√ß√£o Cultural, Recreativa e Desportiva de Labruja (), the Grupo Coral () and the Grupo Animador de Labruja.

Biography L√°szl√≥ Bit√≥ was born in Budapest, Hungary. His family was forced to leave Budapest during the Communist era. He served in a mine in Koml√≥ and became a local leader of the revolution in 1956. After the revolution was crushed by Russian forces, he fled to the United States where he won a scholarship and became a physiologist. He was granted asylum in the United States and came to Bard College in the winter field period of 1956‚Äì57. Bit√≥ graduated from Bard College in 1960 as a pre-med biology major. He went on to obtain his Ph.D. from Columbia University in medical cell biology in 1963. His research led to the development of Xalatan, the drug that has saved the sight of millions of glaucoma sufferers. He has published more than 150 scientific articles and received, among many other honors, the highest recognition in the field of eye research, the Proctor Medal, in 2000 and the Helen Keller Prize for Vision Research in 2013.Laszlo Bito - Helen Keller Foundation Upon retiring from Columbia University as Emeritus Professor of Ocular Physiology, he returned to Hungary and his first love of writing. Of his 14 nonscientific books‚Äînovels, essays, and three anthologies of some of his more than a hundred newspaper and magazine articles‚Äîsome have appeared in translations in half a dozen countries. Scientific career In the United States L√°szl√≥ Bit√≥ has built an academic career as an internationally known professor of physiology. Most of his academic career is connected to Columbia University (where he is Professor Emeritus of Ocular Physiology) and to the University of Puerto Rico where he studied the effect of ageing on the eyes of monkeys. The fruit of his research is Xalatan, the medicine for glaucoma. The development of Xalatan brought a fundamental change to the treatment of this blinding disease. He published more than 140 scientific papers and was awarded with the Proctor Medal (2000) and Columbia University Award for Distinguished Achievement (2004). Writing L√°szl√≥ Bit√≥ gradually moved back to Hungary after the fall of Communism and started a new career as a writer. His first novels are based on his early personal memories of Hungarian history.

His third novel, based on Biblical stories, \\"Abraham and Isaac\\" brought him literary success in 1998. The book was translated to several languages and was put on stage in Budapest theaters. \\"The Teachings of Isaac\\" and \\"Isaac of Nazareth\\" followed the philosophical ideas in \\"Abraham and Isaac\\" to a logical conclusion. His most recent books are the work of an American citizen and a Hungarian patriot.

Eileen and her older sister, the artist Eva, inherited the house after his death in 1942 and lived there for the rest of their lives. She attended Hitchin Girls School and was artistically trained mostly by her father. Achievements Soper showed early promise as an artist, and two of her etchings were shown in the Royal Academy in London at the age of 15 after she showed three prints at an exhibition organised by the International Society of Printmakers in California. She continued to produce around 180 etchings, mostly of children at play, into the early 1930s. Queen Mary bought two of her etchings, among them Flying Swings in 1924. Her work was popular and well received and shown in the UK and the US. Today Soper is best known for her collaboration with Enid Blyton, most notably all of the Famous Five books.

The village is north east of the town of Fakenham, west of Cromer and north of London. The nearest railway station is at Sheringham for the Bittern Line which runs between Sheringham, Cromer and Norwich. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. History and Origins The name Hindringham means \\"The land of the people living behind the hills\\". Hindringham is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it is listed as Hidringham, Hindringaham, and Indregeham.The Domesday Book, England's Heritage, Then and Now, Editor: Thomas Hinde, Norfolk page 190 Prominent landmarks =St Martin Parish Church= The Parish church is dedicated to St Martin and dates from the 14th century. It stands prominent and tall behind a long line of red-roofed flint cottages. A wall separates the churchyard from the six-foot drop to the road. The chancel is offset to the south against the nave. The font dates from the 15th century and is decorated with a Crucifixion, Instruments of the Passion and a Holy Trinity symbol along with heraldic shields. The church has an ancient chest which is thought to be one of the oldest in England, dating from the end of the 12th century. It is a Grade I listed building. =Hindringham Hall= Hindringham Hall is a 16th century moated brick and flint house located roughly quarter of a mile to the North West of the village centre. It was built by Martin Hastings, a courtier in the service of Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and Somerset, the illegitimate son of Henry VIII by his mistress Elizabeth Blount. A lease written in 1562 refers to the house 'now being builded and edified'. It had fallen into decline until restored in 1900 by Gerald Gosselin from Bengeo Hall, Hertfordshire. The interior was completely refurbished, the exterior largely being retained. The moat and associated fish ponds date from the 12th century. They are fed from the River Stiffkey, which runs through the grounds. Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries the ponds were managed by the monks of Norwich Priory, and comprised an important food source for it. Though somewhat silted up, they remain amongst the best preserved in East Anglia. The extensive gardens are the work of the current owners, and include a significant rose collection. They were shortlisted for the Historic Houses 2020 Garden of the Year award. They are open to the public on certain days during the Summer months. =Hindringham Lower Green tower windmill= The village has a windmill although it is actually situated in the nearby hamlet of Lower Green. Amenities The village has a mixed non-denominational Primary School under the control of the Norfolk education authority. Hindringham has a popular sports and social club and this acts as the clubhouse for Hindringham FC on matchdays. Sports and recreation =Hindringham FC= The village football club, Hindringham F.C. was originally formed in 1910 and re-formed in 1986. The club has worked its way up to senior status in the Football Association National Pyramid since the re- formation. They were elected from the North East Norfolk League to the Anglian Combination in 1998 and eventually won promotion to the Premier Division from Division 1 in the 2006-07 season and in dramatic fashion. With only a win good enough in their final game away at Sprowston Wanderers, a goal in second half stoppage time sealed a 1-0 victory and a runner's-up spot. Hindringham stayed in the Premier Division for two seasons before finally being relegated in the 2008-09 season. They had been relegated the previous season but the withdrawal of Halvergate United and Lowestoft Town from the division meant that the club stayed in the Premier Division for another season. They have been in Division 1 ever since the 2008-09 relegation. From the 2005-06 to the 2007-08 season, the club ran a successful youth team which won their league the first season and made two cup final appearances during this time. (Captain Yotis Alamanous Vice Captain Adrian Belton) Hindringham's last home match in front of the old clubhouse was a 6-1 defeat to Norwich St.Johns in Division 1 on 24 April 2010. In May 2010 the old clubhouse was demolished and a new clubhouse opened in March 2011. The clubhouse used to also act as the village pub but is now solely a clubhouse. The building is called 'The Pavilion'. Because of the ongoing work to the clubhouse, the 2010-11 season up to March saw Hindringham play their home games at Kelling Road, Holt and Clipbush Park, Fakenham. Some home games were played on the opposition's ground. The first game after the completion of the new clubhouse was on 12 March 2011 against Sprowston Athletic. Hindringham won 3-0. The club's home ground can either be called The Elms or Wells Road. During their early Anglian Combination years up to the late 2000s, first team matches regularly attracted crowds of around 30-50 with some matches managing to attract crowds close to 100. In an Anglian Combination Division 1 match against Sheringham in May 2005, an attendance of over 100 was recorded. The attendance was confirmed by the then chairman of the club later on. The team play in black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their away kit is black and royal blue striped shirts and royal blue shorts and socks. Hindringham's main rivals are Fakenham Town, Holt United and Wells Town. Other clubs nearby include Walsingham (who Hindringham have traditionally played in an annual pre-season cup competition) and Binham.

Di·ªám put C·∫©n in charge of central Vietnam, stretching from Phan Thi·∫øt in the south to the border at the 17th parallel, with C·∫©n ruling the region as a virtual dictator. Based in the former imperial capital of Hu·∫ø, C·∫©n operated private armies and secret police that controlled the central region and earned himself a reputation as the most oppressive of the Ng√¥ brothers. In his youth, C·∫©n was a follower of the nationalist Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he worked to organise support for Di·ªám as various Vietnamese groups and international powers sought to stamp their authority over Vietnam. C·∫©n, who succeeded in eliminating alternative nationalist opposition in central Vietnam, became the warlord of the region when his brother became president of the southern half of the partitioned nation in 1955. He became notorious for his involvement in smuggling and corruption, as well as his autocratic rule. C·∫©n was regarded as an effective leader against the Viet Cong communist insurgency, which was much weaker in central Vietnam than in other parts of South Vietnam. His Popular Force militia was regarded by US officials in central Vietnam as a successful counter to the communists. C·∫©n's influence began to wane after his elder brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Hu·∫ø. Th·ª•c overshadowed C·∫©n and aggressively promoted Catholicism, which led to the banning of the Buddhist flag in 1963 during Vesak, the celebration of the birthday of Gautama Buddha. C·∫©n's forces opened fire on a crowd who were protesting the ban, killing nine and precipitating the Buddhist crisis. Ongoing demonstrations intensified throughout the summer as the regime responded with increased brutality, sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a November 1963 coup. C·∫©n had been offered asylum by the US Department of State, but ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. had CIA officer Lucien Conein arrest the fallen Ng√¥ in Saigon. C·∫©n was turned over to the military junta, which tried and executed him in 1964. Early years alt=Man with a black cylindrical hat, thick black beard, rimless glasses, wearing a black tunic, stands in front of a white background. C·∫©n was the fifth of six sons born to Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh·∫£, who was a mandarin in the imperial court of Emperor Th√†nh Th√°i, who was ruling under French control.Jacobs, pp. 18‚Äì19.Tucker, pp. 288‚Äì93. Kh·∫£ retired from the court in protest at French interference, taking up farming. C·∫©n's first and third brothers ‚Äì Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Kh√¥i and Di·ªám ‚Äì rose to become provincial governors under French rule. Di·ªám, like his father, resigned in protest in 1933, while Kh√¥i was assassinated in 1945 by H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh's cadres. The second brother, Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, was appointed as the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Hu·∫ø. A fourth brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu became the family's chief political strategist, while the youngest, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Luy·ªán was a diplomat when the family held power in South Vietnam. Of the Ng√¥ brothers, only Th·ª•c and Luy·ªán avoided being executed or assassinated during Vietnam's political upheavals.Tucker, p. 292. Details about C·∫©n's early life are scarce. In his youth, he had studied the writings and opinions of the renowned anti-French Vietnamese nationalist Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u, who spent his last years in Hu·∫ø. Regarded as the leading revolutionary of his time, Ch√¢u had been captured and sentenced to death, before having his sentence reduced to house arrest.Tucker, p. 326.Jacobs, p. 21. C·∫©n regularly traveled to Ch√¢u's sampan on the Perfume River with gifts of food and listened to Ch√¢u's political lectures.Hammer, p. 114. Regarded as the least educated of his family,Karnow, p. 210. C·∫©n had never traveled outside Vietnam and was the only Ng√¥ brother not to have studied at a European-run institution.Buttinger, p. 1253. Vietnam was in chaos after the Japanese invaded the country during World War II and displaced the French colonial administration. At the end of the war, the Japanese left the country, and France, severely weakened by political turmoil within the Vichy regime, was unable to exert control.Tucker, p. 142. H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh's Viet Minh declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and battled other Vietnamese nationalist groups as well as French forces for control of the nation.Jacobs, pp. 22‚Äì25. During this time, C·∫©n organised a clandestine support base for Di·ªám in central Vietnam. At the time, Di·ªám was one of many nationalists who were attempting to stake a claim to national leadership, having spent a decade in self-imposed exile from public affairs. C·∫©n helped weaken other anti-communist nationalist groups, such as the Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party) and the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), which competed with Di·ªám for support. On 23 October 1955, Di·ªám toppled B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i in a fraud-ridden referendum orchestrated by Nhu. Di·ªám declared himself President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later. C·∫©n's men helped to cower the populace into voting for his brother. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water often forced down their nostrils.Karnow, p. 239.Jacobs, p. 95. The violations were particularly flagrant in C·∫©n's area,Miller, p. 207. which was the home of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty and a source of sympathy towards B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. C·∫©n ordered the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In H·ªôi An, some people were killed in election day violence.Miller, p. 208. Rule With Di·ªám's ascent to the leadership of South Vietnam in 1955, C·∫©n's stock rose. C·∫©n had no formal position in the government but was effectively regarded as the warlord of central Vietnam. He had almost unlimited power in the region, often interfering with army operations against the Vi·ªát C·ªông in a style described as \\"feudal\\". Robert Scigliano, a journalist and academic from the Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group, asserted that C·∫©n, along with Nhu, Madame Nhu and eldest brother Archbishop Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c formed \\"an extralegal elite which, with Di·ªám, directs the destiny of Vietnam\\". C·∫©n sometimes vetoed government-appointed officials posted to central Vietnam from Saigon.Scigliano, Robert. South Vietnam: Nation Under Stress (1964), p. 58. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. C·∫©n ran his own personal army and secret police, which fought the Vi·ªát C·ªông and imprisoned other anti-communist political opponents. C·∫©n accumulated great wealth through corrupt practices such as graft in awarding foreign aid contracts from the United States governments of Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy to Vietnamese businessmen. He required the businessmen to pay a fee to the National Revolutionary Movement ‚Äì the official party of the regimeTucker, p. 59. ‚Äì in return for the processing of applications for foreign aid contracts and import licenses. C·∫©n was widely believed to be selling rice to North Vietnam on the black market, as well as organising the trafficking of opium throughout Asia via Laos, and monopolising the cinnamon trade.Buttinger, pp. 954‚Äì55. Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu (right), shaking hands with US Vice President alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. He was often in conflict with his brothers regarding internal matters, with Nhu, Di·ªám's most influential adviser,Jacobs, p. 87. controlling the southern part of the country. The brothers often competed with each other for US aid contracts and the rice trade, but did not interfere with matters in one another's territorial zone.Karnow, p. 246. C·∫©n had once tried to set up an office for his secret police in Saigon (which was in Nhu's southern region) by showing Di·ªám his long list of detained political opponents, but insisted that he not have to report to Nhu.Langguth, p. 99. He brutally suppressed dissent by using torture and re-education camps to achieve his aims. Comparing C·∫©n to his brothers, Scigliano said that he was \\"also considered the most severe, some would say primitive, member of the family and he rules his domain with a strict and sometimes brutal hand\\". Referring to his autocratic style, a Vietnamese critic said that unlike Di·ªám, C·∫©n was consistent and left his followers in no doubt as to what he wanted: \\"They are not confused by double talk about democratic ideals and institutions\\". His creation of a well-defined system of incentives and deterrence has been cited as one reason for his success.Buttinger, pp. 1149‚Äì50. Anti-communism In spite of his autocracy and iron rule, C·∫©n earned praise from Hu·∫ø-based US officials for his relatively high levels of success against the Vi·ªát C·ªông insurgency. C·∫©n's central region was much more peaceful than the restive areas near Saigon and the Mekong Delta. C·∫©n created the Popular Force organisation to operate in central Vietnam. The Popular Force was an alternative to the Strategic Hamlet Program which was used on a much larger scale in the south by Nhu, who moved peasants into fortified camps in an attempt to isolate Vi·ªát C·ªông cadres from accessing the rural populace and intimidating or otherwise gaining their support.Karnow, p. 273. C·∫©n assumed a third or so of the rural peasantry were Vi·ªát C·ªông sympathisers, significant enough to render the hamlets ineffective by intimidating other villagers from within. C·∫©n's Popular Force were a group of volunteers who underwent rigorous training similar to United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. Those who passed the training were put into units of 150 men and assigned to live and work in the villages by day. At night, they did defense patrols, using hit-and-run tactics against the Vi·ªát C·ªông. According to the report by US officials in central Vietnam, the program aroused popular support because of the integration of the Popular Force's personnel into the daily life of the village and the sense of security that the force provided. The units were generally regarded as being successful in their six-month deployments, allowing them to be deployed to the next trouble spot.Jones, p. 205. Officials in Washington disagreed with the assessment of their subordinates in central Vietnam, alleging that C·∫©n was mainly using the Popular Force for repressing dissidents.Jones, p. 217. Buddhist crisis C·∫©n was considered the most secular of the four Ng√¥ brothers who controlled Vietnam's domestic affairs. With the appointment of elder brother Th·ª•c as the Archbishop of Hu·∫ø in 1961, C·∫©n became less influential as Th·ª•c aggressively blurred the distinction between church and state. In early 1963, Nhu sent an emissary from Saigon telling C·∫©n to retire and leave for Japan.Hammer, pp. 105‚Äì10. Unrest erupted in the summer of 1963. After the flying of Vatican flags was permitted at a celebration for the anniversary of Th·ª•c's consecration as a bishop, the flying of Buddhist flags on 8 May to commemorate Vesak ‚Äì the birth of Gautama Buddha ‚Äì was banned. C·∫©n's subordinates ordered government forces to fire on the unarmed Buddhist crowd protesting the ban, killing nine. C·∫©n believed the United States, whose relations with South Vietnam had become strained, caused an explosion during the Vesak shootings, to destabilise his family's regime.Hammer, p. 116. Another notable religious incident occurred in the central region under C·∫©n's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of ƒê√† N·∫µng. Local Buddhists began to believe that the fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among C·∫©n's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel L√™ Quang Tung under the direction of Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.Prochnau, p. 411. Downfall and arrest alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. Sparked by the killings in Hu·∫ø on Vesak, the Buddhists organised nationwide mass protests against the religious bias of the Di·ªám regime throughout the summer of 1963, demanding religious equality.Tucker, pp. 288‚Äì89.Jacobs, pp. 142‚Äì52. The protests were met with brutal crackdowns, including ARVN Special Forces attacks on Buddhist pagodas which left hundreds missing, presumed dead.Jacobs, pp. 152‚Äì53. As public discontent heightened, a group of ARVN officers planned and carried out a US-backed coup in November. This came about after C·∫©n's prot√©g√© T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, a 37-year-old who became the youngest-ever general in the ARVN due to his loyalty to the Di·ªám regime,Karnow, p. 317. switched sides and helped the coup when his corps was expected to remain loyal.Karnow, pp. 318‚Äì22. Di·ªám and Nhu were executed at the conclusion of the coup.Karnow, p. 326. Following the downfall of the Ng√¥ family, the White House came under pressure from the South Vietnamese public to take a hard line against C·∫©n. Mass graves containing 200 bodies were found on his land. The US consul in Hu·∫ø, John Helble, confirmed the existence of rows of 18th-century style dungeons with filthy, dark cells in an old French arsenal. Although junta member General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n asserted that the compound predated the Di·ªám era, the town's citizens saw C·∫©n as a mass murderer. On 4 November, two days after the coup ended, thousands of irate townspeople walked three kilometres to C·∫©n's house on the city's southern outskirts ‚Äì where he lived with his aged mother ‚Äì demanding vengeance. The junta had ringed the home with barbed wire and armoured cars, sensing that the populace would riot and attack C·∫©n. By this time, C·∫©n had escaped to a Catholic seminary, but was considering applying to the Americans for political asylum. The US State Department was faced with a dilemma: sheltering C·∫©n would associate them with the protection of a corrupt and authoritarian regime that had tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of its own people. Allowing C·∫©n to be attacked by angry mobs would damage the reputation of the new American-backed junta. The State Department instructed: The White House sent a cable to the US Embassy, Saigon on 4 November agreeing that C·∫©n and his mother needed evacuation. General ƒê·ªó Cao Tr√≠, the commander of the ARVN I Corps, who had repressed the Buddhists in Hu·∫ø, privately told C·∫©n that the junta would allow him safe passage out of Vietnam. On 5 November, C·∫©n sought refuge at the US consulate with a suitcase crammed with US currency. Tr√≠ was then told that C·∫©n was not safe in Hu·∫ø and that he was to send C·∫©n to Saigon immediately for his own protection. Tr√≠ would only promise safe passage in an American plane to Saigon, where embassy officials would meet C·∫©n. On the journey to the capital, C·∫©n was accompanied by four Americans: a vice-consul, two military policemen and a lieutenant colonel.Jones, p. 433. He had intended to seek asylum in Japan.Hammer, pp. 305‚Äì06. US ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. had other ideas. Instead of sending embassy officials to T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t airport, Lodge sent CIA officer Lucien Conein, who had helped the Vietnamese generals to plan the coup. Conein turned C·∫©n over to the junta. Lodge said that General ƒê√¥n had promised that C·∫©n would be dealt with \\"legally and judicially\\". The ambassador told Washington that asylum was unnecessary, saying \\"It seems to me that our reason for giving him asylum therefore no longer exists\\". He said that the US could not interfere with justice, since C·∫©n was \\"undoubtedly a reprehensible figure who deserves all the loathing which he now receives\\". Lodge reasoned that since C·∫©n would not be killed, protecting him would give the impression that the US backed his activities. Lodge said that General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, who was the President, implied that C·∫©n would receive clemency even if sentenced to death. This contradicted Conein's assertion that the ARVN officer corps felt that C·∫©n should be executed. C·∫©n's case was damaged by the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners, who recounted tales of torture at the hands of the Ng√¥ brothers.Jones, p. 434. Trial and execution It was reported that General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh ‚Äì who had deposed Minh in a January 1964 coup ‚Äì offered C·∫©n exile if he handed over his foreign bank deposits. C·∫©n protested, saying that he had no money. ƒê√¥n later claimed that Kh√°nh would have executed C·∫©n anyway, as C·∫©n would have known of the corruption that the generals were party to.Hammer, pp. 306‚Äì07. During the Ng√¥ era, Kh√°nh commanded the ARVN II Corps, which had operated in the Central Highlands under C·∫©n's supervision.Tucker, p. 299.Tucker, p. 580. Despite having helped to arrest C·∫©n, Lodge advised Kh√°nh to be restrained in his handling of the case for fear of stoking religious resentment or upsetting international opinion with a death penalty.McAllister, p. 760. Lodge later claimed the South Vietnamese prosecutors failed to make any case against C·∫©n. The Vietnamese leader also had to contend with the other side of the arguments, from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Di·ªám regime. During the trial, Th√≠ch Tr√≠ Quang, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for C·∫©n. He argued that if C·∫©n lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against C·∫©n.McAllister, p. 778. C·∫©n was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minhwho was still the titular head of statein the position of approving a third death in the Ng√¥ family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung to execute Di·ªám and Nhu during the coup.Karnow, pp. 325‚Äì26. C·∫©n's diabetes worsened during the course of the trial, and by the time he was executed, his elderly mother had died. He suffered a heart attack while in custody. On 9 May 1964, he was carried on a stretcher into the prison courtyard and assisted by guards and two Catholic priests to stand alongside the post to which he was tied. He was blindfolded against his request and shot in front of approximately 200 observers. Lodge defended his actions, claiming the United States did all it could to prevent the execution. The ambassador claimed C·∫©n would have been allowed to seek refuge at the US embassy, despite the fact that he had ordered Conein to intercept C·∫©n at the airport. Rev. Cao VƒÉn Lu√¢n, Catholic rector of Hu·∫ø University who had been fired for falling afoul of the powerful Archbishop Th·ª•c, asked Lodge that C·∫©n not be executed. According to Lu√¢n, Lodge reportedly assured the rector the execution would not take place. C·∫©n left his personal fortune, which had indeed been deposited in foreign banks, to Catholic charities.Langguth, p. 258.

Pasni town, like the rest of Makran Coast, is affected by an active fault (the Makran Accretionary Front) caused by the northward movement (40‚Äì50 mm/year) of the Arabian Plate against the Eurasian Plate. Tectonic activity emanating from this subduction zone in the Arabian Sea causes occasional, low intensity quakes. On 28 Nov 1945, a tsunami, triggered by the 1945 Balochistan earthquake, completely destroyed Pasni town. Demography Pasni street scene The population is predominantly Balochis in Pasni. These Baloch clans include: Kalmati, Bizanjo, etc. who belong to traditional ruling communities and currently, tend to dominate land ownership and the fishing industry. Pasni also has some other tribes such as Barr, Mullahzai, Jadgaal, Wadaila people living in this small town, but the working classes have traditionally comprised Medh, Darzada, Puxh, Maqsoodi and Naqeeb, some of whom are groups that were historically slaves of the ruling families. People of East African ancestry commonly known as Koweeg or 'sheedis' can also be found in Pasni in small numbers; this African lineage is found at low frequency in the rest of Makran, as well as Karachi. 'Sheedis' are mostly descended from female slaves brought in as concubines in the early 19th century, when slave trade flourished under Omani Sultans whose suzerainty extended over Gwadar till 1958. https://web.archive.org/web/20061011071126/http://hgm2002.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/Abstracts/Publish/WorkshopPosters/WorkshopPoster11/hgm0573.htm] Facilities The city houses a modern fish harbour and Port of Pasni, with fishing being the main occupation of the city dwellers. Frozen catch is also sent to Turbat and Karachi for sale in the larger markets. Pasni Airport is shared by Pakistan Air Force (PAF), Pakistan Navy and civil aviation. PAF as well as PN-Aviation operational facilities are housed nearby. Daily commercial flights link the town with Karachi. In 2008, the government approved the construction of Shadi Kaur storage dam 50 km north of Pasni, which was inaugurated in September 2017 and is expected to alleviate some of the water deficiency of the region.PC to initiate construction of two dams in Balochistan. Daily Times. 20 April 2008 History Other than being a small fishing village, the city does not figure much in history. Alexander the Great is said to have stopped at Pasni (called 'Cysa' in Arrian's treatise Indica) while unsuccessfully trying to rendezvous with his admiral, Nearchus, during a disastrous exodus via Makran after the Indian Campaign (325 BC). According to one theory, Admiral Nearchus' well-stocked fleet was supposed to have continuously provisioned Alexander's army as the latter marched West along the barren coast towards Persia. In the event, a major portion of Alexander's route through Makran (Bela-Averan-Hoshab-Turbat and then south to Pasni- Gwadar) turned out to be much further inland than expected, apparently due to faulty knowledge of the terrain. An unexplored Harappan-era settlement known as Sokhta Koh is tucked away in the low hills, about 25 km north of Pasni. It is conjectured that this was an ancient Harappan outpost which traded luxury wares with Mesopotamia and Persian Gulf settlements. The city of Pasni, along with Gwadar, were burned by the Portuguese in 1581, having had some violent encounters with the Kalmatis in the area. The city was attacked again, by Baloch rebels during the 1898 Baloch uprising; the city was looted, and the telegraph lines running to Gwadar severed.

On August 26, 1990, the rock band KISS performed at the arena as part of their Hot in the Shade Tour. During the show, the band's enormous stage set overloaded the arena's power supply causing a transformer to explode outside the building and cutting electricity inside the arena. This abruptly ended the show before the band could complete their set.

He was condemned to death on 1 February 1578, and was confined after the trial in an underground dungeon in the Tower of London, the Pit of the Tower. While in prison he subsisted on bread and water and was able to say Mass. On his execution day he refused to see several Protestant ministers, after meeting with family members. He was taken to Tyburn and was allowed to speak before the bystanders, who were mostly hostile in the historically Protestant London.

Neild, Jr. (1908‚Äì1958) who, with his father in 1937, had designed the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum in Shreveport. The coliseum is named after William Rex Hirsch, a former fair president, manager and treasurer. The building completed construction in 1954, the year of Hirsch's death, and initially was planned to have the name The Youth Building. The coliseum has been used for a variety of events through the years, with dirt being brought in and placed on the floor for rodeos and tractor pulls. It is located adjacent to the Independence Stadium and across from Fair Park High School in Shreveport. Hirsch coliseum is very similar in design, though smaller in size to the John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum (completed in 1937 and designed by Neild, Sr), owned and operated by the Louisiana State University Campus in Baton Rouge. However, the Parker coliseum has a dirt floor arena and is mainly used for livestock-type events, with portable hard floors laid on top of the dirt for other types of events such as basketball games or concerts. Sports tenants The Hirsch was home to the professional Shreveport Mudbugs minor league ice hockey team, from 1997, until they moved to the CenturyTel Center, in Bossier City in 2000. It hosted the 1981 Atlantic Sun Conference men's basketball tournament and has hosted the Southland Conference men's basketball tournament six times. It was also home to the Shreveport-Bossier Bombers indoor football team. The Coliseum has hosted many professional wrestling events over the years including NWA, WCW and WWE events. From 2013 to 2015, the Hirsch was home to a professional basketball franchise through the American Basketball Association called the Shreveport-Bossier Mavericks.

His next and final appearance at the coliseum would be on July 1, 1976, 13 months before his death on August 16 of the following year. Rush was scheduled to perform during their Roll the Bones Tour on February 22, 1992, with Primus as their opening act, but the show was cancelled due to Geddy Lee contracting laryngitis. In January 1995, it was the scene of a small scale riot, when a Pantera concert was cancelled at the last minute, because of a city ordinance that had just gone into effect, requiring seating on the floor, which the band felt created an unsafe situation for the fans and themselves.

He was then named the Alexandria municipal public works director under then Mayor Carroll E. Lanier, upon the retirement for health reasons of the previous director, Malcolm Hebert.Anthony D'Angelo was married for sixty-three years to the former Agnes Maggio (1926-2017), a native of Natchitoches. The couple had six children. Beginning September 1, 2017, a private firm called SMG will assume management of the Coliseum; the company was actually in place a month earlier in preparation for the transition. SMG has a five-year contract to run the facility. With the Rapides Parish Jury's decision to allow SMG to take over operations for the Coliseum, the officials held a special meeting on August 11, 2017, and voted to dissolve the Coliseum Authority. Rapides Parish officials contend that SMG can offer better incentives to promoters so that a smaller market like Alexandria can land quality entertainment.

On November 6, 2012, Rapides Parish voters approved a $23 million bond issue back by a $2.5 million property tax for the coliseum. Also approved was a $1 million tax to pay for the coliseum maintenance and operations for a period of 20 years. The $23 million taxes would pay for renovation projects that included an expanded seating capacity, a new 3-story lobby, sky boxes and exhibition hall, improved electrical systems and roofing, new rest rooms, stages, dressing rooms, and a basketball floor, and a rebuilt parking space. The coliseum also features a new center-hung video display. The renovation was designed to give the coliseum a modern appeal and attract larger events for the Rapides Parish area. Start of construction for the project was delayed due to the Rapides Parish Police Jury's difficulty of obtaining a permit to begin the renovations because of dispute between them and the city of Alexandria over the Rapides Parish Coliseum parking lot issue which was eventually settled.

They took on the name BSG Stahl Brandenburg in 1955 to reflect the backing of the local steel company. With that support, the club was able to assemble competitive sides by offering attractive salaries to the castoffs of other teams. The strategy drew some capable players to their ranks and helped them develop a solid fan base.

After a year at this level it dropped back to the Oberliga and down to the Verbandsliga Brandenburg in 1996. By the end of the 90s they found themselves mired in financial difficulty. The club declared bankruptcy in 1998 and quickly re-formed as FC Stahl Brandenburg, but continued to stumble. In 2002, in a desperate move to save something of the club, a merger with crosstown rival Brandenburger SC S√ºd 05 to form FC Brandenburg was put into the works, but only went as far as the union of the clubs' youth sides. Fan protests from both sides ‚Äì and more money problems ‚Äì caused the merger to unravel the next year. Today, after a stint in the tier seven Landesliga FC Stahl Brandenburg play in the Brandenburg-Liga (VI) as a lower table side.Das deutsche Fu√üball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tablesFC Stahl Brandenburg at Fussball.de Tables and results of all German football leagues Rugby department During the East German era, the club also had a rugby union department, which now is separate club, the Stahl Brandenburg Rugby.

It was designed by HOK Sport (now Populous), with the exterior designed by Morris Adjmi Architects. Opened in 2007, it is the home of the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the men's basketball program of Seton Hall University, known as the Seton Hall Pirates. The arena officially seats 16,514 patrons for hockey games and up to 18,711 for basketball. Fans and sports writers have affectionately nicknamed the arena \\"The Rock\\" in reference to the Rock of Gibraltar, the corporate logo of Prudential Financial, a financial institution that owns the naming rights to the arena and is headquartered within walking distance of it. In December 2013, the arena ranked third nationally and ninth internationally for self-reported annual revenue. The arena was built amidst financial concerns and years of speculation that the Devils would relocate, despite the fact that the team was a perennial playoff contender and had been at or near the top of the NHL's standings for over a decade. The arena is located two blocks from Newark Penn Station in downtown Newark, just west of Newark's Ironbound district, which makes it easily accessible via New Jersey Transit, PATH, Newark Light Rail, and Amtrak. At the time of its opening, Prudential Center was the first major league sports venue to be built in the New York metropolitan area since the Brendan Byrne Arena, the Devils' former home, opened in 1981. According to the Devils organization, the Prudential Center has played a major role in the revitalization of downtown Newark. History =Planning= For years, the New Jersey Devils had been rumored to be at least considering relocation. Even when the team won the Stanley Cup in 1995, it was amidst rumors that the franchise would move to Nashville. Despite playing championship-caliber hockey in the 2002‚Äì03 season culminating in a Stanley Cup that year, the Devils only averaged 14,858 fans per game at their home arena, Continental Airlines Arena at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford. A project to build a new 18,000-seat arena in Newark first received funding from Newark's city council in 2002, when the team was owned by Puck Holdings, a subsidiary of YankeeNets. In 2004, former Lehman Brothers executive Jeffrey Vanderbeek bought the team from Puck Holdings and became a strong proponent of the proposed arena. Vanderbeek said, \\"The Devils need a new arena that can provide a game-day experience that is certainly equal to the best team in the National Hockey League and certainly equal to the product that is put on the ice.\\" He also stated that he believed the arena \\"would take downtown Newark to a whole new level.\\" After legal battles over both eminent domain and the city's financial participation in the arena project, the final deal was approved by council and went through in October 2004. =Construction and funding= Prudential Center, under construction in June 2007 A site for the arena in downtown Newark was selected, bordered by Edison Place on the north, Lafayette Street on the south, Mulberry Street on the east, and Broad Street on the west. The site was the location of the never-completed Renaissance Mall and, previously, the tracks and train shed of the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Broad/Lafayette Street terminal whose building still stands nearby. The arena was designed by HOK Sport, with the exterior designed by Morris Adjmi Architects. Initial designs were released in early 2005 and referred to the arena as \\"Newark Arena\\". Groundbreaking began on October 3, 2005, and a workforce of 2,725 union workers was employed to construct the arena. Financial issues, though, threatened to halt the deal. On January 24, 2006, the Devils averted having the project canceled by submitting a guarantee in writing that the team would contribute $100 million to the arena, one day before their deadline. Though construction was well underway, in late summer 2006, Cory Booker, who had recently taken office as Mayor of Newark, promised to reevaluate the deal and considered backing out. In October, Booker conceded there would be \\"a first-class arena built in the city of Newark, whether we like it or not\\", and soon afterwards, the Devils struck a deal including both property and monetary givebacks that appeased city officials. The city of Newark pledged to contribute $210 million to the construction of the arena, using settlement money from its lease dispute over underpaid rent for use of Newark Liberty International Airport with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Devils paid for the remainder of the cost. Thus, no new direct taxpayer funding was required for the construction of the arena. Some taxpayer dollars, however, were spent on infrastructure improvements. These improvements were necessary for both the new arena and proposed private development surrounding that arena. Prudential Financial purchased the naming rights to the stadium in January 2007 for $105.3 million over 20 years, reducing the city's cost for the project. The arena had been referred to as \\"Newark Arena\\" before the deal. In addition to its formal name, Prudential Center was immediately nicknamed \\"The Rock\\" after Prudential's corporate logo. Construction on the arena was completed in October 2007. The estimated final cost of the arena's construction is $380 million. In total, more than 18,000 tons of steel were used to build the bowl area and high roof, while 62,000 linear feet of ductwork were installed throughout the arena. The Devils had to play their first nine games of the 2007‚Äì08 NHL season on the road as construction on their home arena was finished. =Opening= For the soft opening on October 20, the Newark Boys Chorus performed at Prudential Center, which became the first use of the arena. It officially opened on October 25, 2007, with a series of 10 concerts by the New Jersey native rock group Bon Jovi, featuring a star-studded lineup of opening acts including Big & Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Daughtry, The All-American Rejects and fellow New Jersey native group My Chemical Romance. The Devils played their first home game at Prudential Center on October 27, 2007, against the Ottawa Senators, who, coincidentally, were the Devils' last opponent at Continental Airlines Arena. Chris Neil scored the arena's first goal, while Brian Gionta scored the Devils' first goal in the arena. Martin Gerber earned the first win as the Senators defeated the Devils 4‚Äì1. On November 11, 2007, the first collegiate basketball game took place in the arena, with Seton Hall defeating Monmouth, 89‚Äì81, in overtime. =Lighting incident= On January 8, 2010, a lighting problem occurred in the arena during a game between the Devils and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Tampa Bay was leading 3‚Äì0 with 9:12 left in the second period when half of the arena's sports lights went out due to a power surge on the grid feeding electricity to the arena, followed by a computerized lighting system failing to reboot. PSEG and Prudential Center electricians worked on the situation for 1 hour and 52 minutes but could not reboot the system. The game was suspended due to the lighting problem; it was resumed two nights later, with about 3,000 of the original crowd of 15,129 in attendance. Tampa Bay won, 4‚Äì2, with Lightning center Steven Stamkos scoring two goals in the contest: one on Friday and one on Sunday. Arena usage A view of the ice from Section 232, following a New Jersey Devils game Prudential Center primarily serves as the home arena for the New Jersey Devils hockey franchise, who previously played at the Meadowlands Arena from 1982 to 2007, as well as the home court of the NCAA's Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball program, who also played in the Meadowlands from 1985 to 2007. The arena also hosts select home games for the Seton Hall Pirates women's basketball team, and the NJIT Highlanders men's basketball team. The arena was a former home of the New York Titans of the National Lacrosse League until 2009, when the team moved to Orlando. =Ice hockey= The Devils won their first regular season game at the arena on October 31, 2007, by defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning 6‚Äì1, led by a hat trick by Jay Pandolfo. The Devils' first playoff game win at the arena came on April 15, 2009, when they defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 4‚Äì1 in Game 1 of the First Round. The Devils' first playoff series-clinching win at the arena was on May 25, 2012, when they defeated the rival New York Rangers 3‚Äì2 in overtime on a goal by Adam Henrique to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. Games 1, 2, and 5 of the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals were played at the arena. =College basketball= The Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball team moved into the arena on November 11, 2007, and defeated the Monmouth University Hawks by a score of 89‚Äì81 in overtime. In November 2007 and 2008, the Center hosted the semifinals and finals of college basketball's Legends Classic. The arena hosted the East Regional semifinals and final of the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. =Professional basketball= The Prudential Center was originally intended to also be the home of the New Jersey Nets, but the team was sold to real estate developer Bruce Ratner, who intended to build an arena in Brooklyn for the team, and the Nets remained in the Meadowlands while awaiting construction of what became the Barclays Center. However, the construction of the Barclays Center was plagued by lawsuits and economic issues during the late 2000s recession. In the fall of 2009, the Nets played two preseason games at the Prudential Center, while considering a possible move there. After the success of the preseason games at the Prudential Center, the Nets finalized a deal to move to the Prudential Center. On June 23, 2011, the arena hosted the 2011 NBA draft, marking the second time the NBA draft was held in New Jersey. The arena held the NBA draft once again the following year on June 28, 2012. On April 23, 2012, the Nets played their final game at the Prudential Center, a 105‚Äì87 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. Lou Williams made the final basket on the court. The Nets subsequently relocated to the Barclays Center to become the Brooklyn Nets at the beginning of the 2012-13 NBA season. The New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) played home games at Prudential Center during the 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons, due to renovations at Madison Square Garden. =Indoor soccer= The New Jersey Ironmen of the indoor Xtreme Soccer League (XSL) played their inaugural home game at Prudential Center on December 1, 2007. A crowd of 13,429 was on hand to see soccer legend Pel√©, who was the honorary captain, take the ceremonial first kick. The Ironmen won this game 8‚Äì6 over the Detroit Ignition. The Ironmen folded along with the XSL in 2009. =Boxing and MMA= Boxing promoter Main Events has hosted a number of fight cards, most notably headlined by former world champions Zab Judah and Tomasz Adamek. Due to the large Polish population in the North Jersey area, Adamek has drawn upwards of 10,000 fans for his last few bouts, including almost 11,000 against Michael Grant on August 21, 2010. The UFC held UFC 78 on November 17, 2007, one of the first events to take place at the new arena. It marked the first UFC event in New Jersey in two years. It also played host to UFC 111, which took place on March 27, 2010. On March 19, 2011, it hosted UFC 128, UFC 159 on April 27, 2013, and UFC 169 on February 1, 2014. =Gymnastics= On November 11, 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions. =Professional wrestling= WWE has held multiple events at Prudential Center including Hell in a Cell in 2009, Extreme Rules in 2016, and Backlash on May 6, 2018.

On March 25, 2020, the arena was due to host an AEW Dynamite special episode Blood and Guts, featuring All Elite Wrestling's first-ever Blood and Guts match. However, the event was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. =NFL= The National Football League used the arena for Super Bowl XLVIII Media Day on January 28, 2014, instead of the game's outdoor site, nearby MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford. =Concerts= Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, for years a staple at the Meadowlands Arena, performed their first show at the Prudential Center on May 2, 2012, as part of their Wrecking Ball World Tour. They returned to the arena on January 31, 2016, for a date on the opening leg of The River Tour 2016. The McDonald's Gospelfest, the nation's largest gospel music competition, has taken place at the arena since 2008. The Eagles' performance at the arena on their Long Road out of Eden Tour is commemorated with murals on the arena's upper suite level.

Features =Design= The lower level Grand Concourse, with the Goal Bar on the upper right, features jerseys from most high school hockey teams in New Jersey. The red and gray exterior is inspired by Newark's bricklaying and railroad heritage. Fans approaching the arena from the front are presented with a view of the arena's externally mounted 4,800 square foot (446 m2) LED display, one of the largest in the world. The Daktronics display is split up into thin panels with gaps in between, in order to prevent the fans' view from inside from being obstructed. Along the arena's east side Mulberry Street entrance are two large \\"entrance cylinders\\" named the Ford Tower and Investor's Bank Tower, the arena's most prominent exterior feature. These towers take the fans up to the Grand Concourse, by escalator and staircase. The interior's lower level Grand Concourse provides views of downtown Newark on the Edison Place and Mulberry Street sides through large windows. Prudential Center features separate concourses for the lower and upper levels, whereas the Continental Airlines Arena had one concourse for both levels of the arena. Throughout the Grand Concourse, jerseys of most high school hockey teams in New Jersey hang from the walls. The arena also features many murals of players and memorable moments from Devils history. One mural encompasses a long stretch of the Grand Concourse wall and features Devils Martin Brodeur, Scott Stevens, and Ken Daneyko, along with tributes to other New Jersey sports and Newark landmarks, with depictions that include Seton Hall men's basketball legends Richie Regan and Terry Dehere, soccer player Tony Meola, a boxer, and tennis legend Althea Gibson. =Amenities and facilities= The new scoreboard installed in 2017 before its first regular season game in service. A mural outside the Prudential Center (featuring Martin Brodeur in the center) in front of a double-length bus stop. As one of the newer facilities to be used in the NHL, the Prudential Center features a large array of amenities. The rink area features LED ribbons circumnavigating the arena and a scoreboard by Trans-Lux installed in 2017, weighing over 44 tons and the largest in-arena, center-hung scoreboard in the world, replacing a smaller, lower-resolution eight-sided unit from Daktronics. The 76 luxury suites available are the largest in North America. Personal dining, WiFi, and HDTVs are some of the many conveniences available in the luxury suites. There are 750 flat-screen TVs in total across the arena. On each side of the lower bowl the three middle sections consist of a combined 2,330 Club seats. These black-colored seats emblazoned with the Devils' logo are wider with more legroom. Club seat and season ticket holders have access to a 350-seat restaurant on the suite level in one of the end zones with views of the rink and practice rink. Additionally, the Goal Bar, located on Suite Level One offers Club and Goal Bar seat holders terrace-style seating in a bar environment. Club Seat holders also have access to lounges on the main concourse offering buffet-style food options. One of these lounges contains the television camera staging area and the commentating post at which Steve Cangialosi and Ken Daneyko call games for MSG Plus telecasts, whereas home radio broadcasts and all road team broadcasts originate from the press box above the 200 level. On the north, Edison Place side of the arena, at street level, are the ticket office and the Devils' 2,600 square foot (242 m2) Team Store, along with Championship Plaza, a public meeting place that celebrates the Devils' past and present successes on the ice. Attached to the Prudential Center are the Devils' corporate offices and practice rink, which contains its own locker rooms.

Practice rink The Devils's practice rink, the RWJ Barnabas Health Hockey House (formerly AmeriHealth Pavilion), is attached to the arena, located on the south side of the building. On select days, it is open to fans after the game for public ice skating. The practice rink also served as the home of the Metropolitan Riveters of the National Women's Hockey League from 2016 to 2019. The Saint Peter's Prep Mauraders hockey teams, NJIT Highlanders club hockey team that competes in the Colonial States College Hockey Conference, and other local youth teams also use the rink. It has been the home The arena also hosts the NJSIAA Public A, Public B, and Private State Finals for high school ice hockey. Championship Plaza and environs Championship Plaza, an outdoor space designed to celebrate the Devils' 30-year history, is located opposite the PNC Bank Tower on Mulberry Street between Edison Place and Market Street. \\"We are working hard to enhance our fans' experience at Prudential Center, and continue our effort to be a cornerstone in the revitalization of Newark\\", Vanderbeek said in a released statement. \\"Championship Plaza is going to be a great place to gather with friends, meet new fans and celebrate Jersey's team.\\" The most prominent piece of the project is the tall, stainless steel hockey player statue. The Prudential rock, inspired by the Rock of Gibraltar, was also installed in the plaza, and placed along Mulberry Street. Devil fans were able purchase a limited amount of bricks that would be placed in and around the plaza with personalized messages inscribed. The plaza was opened to the public on October 3, 2009. On the opposite end of the arena, a statue of former New Jersey Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur was dedicated outside of the Lafayette Street entrance tower and practice rink on October 22, 2016. Much like the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the Prudential Center was expected to boost Newark's urban renaissance. Small-scale projects in the immediate vicinity of the arena around Four Corners have led to the construction of new hotels, loft conversions, and a restaurant row. The development of Mulberry Commons (known as Triangle Park during its conception), a city square originally proposed as the centerpiece of a commercial and residential complex near the arena, stagnated for a decade before construction began in October 2017. The park finally opened after 15 years of delay on May 30, 2019. Accessibility and transportation Located only two blocks from Newark Penn Station, the Prudential Center, like its other two major counterparts in the New York metropolitan area, Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center, is one of the most easily accessible arenas in the country. Public transportation access is provided via NJ Transit trains and buses, PATH trains, Newark Light Rail, and Amtrak. Major highways in the arena's vicinity include I-95 on the New Jersey Turnpike, I-78, I-280, US 1/9, NJ 21, US 22, and the Garden State Parkway.

It is listed as a critically endangered species due to ongoing habitat loss. It is the only known member of the genus Pharotis, which is closely related to Nyctophilus. Previously, the species was believed to have been extinct since 1890. In 2014, researchers realized that a female bat collected near Kamali in 2012 was a member of this species.  Taxonomy  The genus Pharotis and the species Pharotis imogene were both described in 1914 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas. The specimens used by Thomas to describe the species had been collected by Lamberto Loria in 1890. Thomas obtained the specimens via Giacomo Doria of the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale. The etymology of the prefix \\"phar-\\" is unclear. The suffix \\"-otis\\" is from Ancient Greek \\"Œø·ΩñœÇ,\\" meaning \\"ear\\". Furthermore, the etymology or eponym of imogene is also unclear. An arrangement within the family Vespertilionidae, the common evening bats, allies this genus to the similar Nyctophilus, within subfamilial taxon Vespertilioninae as the tribe Nyctophilini, known as the big-eared bats of Australia and New Guinea. Description Its fur is dark brown; its ears and flight membranes are brown as well. It is similar in appearance to the small-toothed long-eared bat, Nyctophilus microdon, with which it is sometimes confused. It can be differentiated from Nyctophilus species by looking at the skin between the nostrils--in the New Guinea big-eared bat, this skin is hairless, while it has fine hairs in Nyctophilus. Its forearm length is approximately . Its ears and tragi are both long, at and , respectively. Its head and body length is . Individuals weigh roughly . Biology and ecology Little is known about this species, as it is rarely encountered. Based on its large ears, however, it is hypothesized that it might hunt for insect prey using low-intensity echolocation. It possibly captures prey by gleaning, which means plucking them off of a surface rather than aerial pursuit. Range and habitat The individual captured in 2012 was in a logged lowland rainforest of the Abau District of Papua New Guinea. Its habitat preference is unknown, but possibly includes lowland sclerophyll woodlands or woodlands with patches of rainforest. Conservation In 2020, the IUCN classified this species as critically endangered. The species had not been definitively encountered since 1890. In 2012, researchers rediscovered the species when they captured an adult female, though at first they were unsure which species they had found. Due to its imperiled status, it is identified by the Alliance for Zero Extinction as a species in danger of imminent extinction. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation.

History Stewart Shillito, the son of John Shillito, the founder of the Cincinnati department store, Shillito's, had seen tennis played while on vacation at the fashionable seaside resort of Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island, and in 1878 he decided to build a court at his father's home on Highland Avenue and Oak Street in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Mt. Auburn. After the first court was built, interest spread rapidly among enthusiastic friends of Shillito, and by 1880, Cincinnati was ready for a tennis club. On December 3, 1880, Edmund H. Pendleton presided over a meeting held at the Burnet House in Cincinnati, the purpose being the organization of a tennis club. A constitution was drawn up and the following officers were nominated and elected: President - Jeptha Garrand; Secretary - Howard S. Winslow; and Treasurer - Albert C. Barney. In one week, 86 players were enrolled as members, and the south wing of Music Hall was leased for indoor play until May 1881, making Cincinnati the site of some of the earliest indoor play in America. The lease on Music Hall was renewed for an additional year, but soon thereafter the decision was made to terminate the agreement. (The story is that the roof leaked, and the club members wanted a discount on the rent because of it.) With the termination of the lease, the era of the nineteenth century indoor tennis ended in Cincinnati. At the time one of the officers of the Club, Howard S. Winslow, lived on Oak Street and Reading Road. His father generously made available to the members if the Club (CTC) sufficient ground to lay three grass courts at the rear of his property which was adjacent to a lane. The city fathers, seeing growing tennis activity, named the lane Tennis Lane. It continues to bear that name today. The CTC remained at that location through 1885, when it moved, with no explanation, to a new location on Arbigust Street (now called Vernon Place). For the next 13 years the Club occupied two different locations on Vernon Place. During these years the Club grew in terms of membership and activity, and in two of the three years, 1891 and 1893, the club sponsored the Ohio State Adult Championship. Having moved twice in 13 years, the club began looking in 1898 for a more permanent address. Among the members of CTC were John B. Keys and John Scarborough. Each owned tracts of land which they were interested in developing into a subdivision. They both hoped to do the club a favor, and at the same time enhance the value of their holdings by encouraging the club to locate on their property. John Keys offered as a gift of land on Bedford Avenue adjoining the new Cincinnati Golf Club. John Scarborough offered the Club what is substantially its present location, not as a gift, but rent free for the first few years. Mr. Scarborough agreed to lay out four courts and build a club house at his own expense. Finally in the spring of 1899, Scarborough's offer was excepted because Keys' property on Bedford was considered \\"too far out in the country and somewhat inaccessible\\". Thirty- eight members from Vernon Place along with many new members brought the membership to 186 when the courts were opened. Some of the improvements promised in the Scarborough agreements were not completed until 1900. In the first year at the new location there were four courts, the present courts 1, 2, 9 and 10. In 1904 three more courts were added to the upper tier, the present 6, 7 and 8. In 1925 three courts were added to the lower tier, courts 3, 4 and 5. The original club house was torn down in 1905 and replaced with the present structure in 1906. The Tri-State Tournament Between the years of 1903 and 1968, and with the exception of about 10 years, the Club hosted the popular and well-known tournament known as the Tri-State Tennis Tournament. This event attracted many of the best male and female players from around the country and the world, and the tournament was always one of the major events on the major tennis schedule during the Pre-Open Era. In 1904 The Cincinnati Enquirer reported: \\"Such a number of noted tennis players from cities throughout the United States has been entered that the Tri-State Tournament ranks very high, being surpassed in importance only by the National Lawn Tennis Association Tournament at Newport, R.I.\\" Many great players, both men and women, participated in the tournament. Its list of winners reads like a \\"Who's Who'\\" of tennis - Nat Emerson, Beals Wright, Bill Tilden, George Lott, Bobby Riggs, Frank Parker, Bill Talbert, Tony Trabert, Barry MacKay, May Sutton, Alice Marble, Pauline Betz, and Dorothy Bundy, to name but a few. This tournament eventually would grow into what is now known as the Western & Southern Open. The tournament, now held in the Cincinnati suburb of Mason, is the oldest tournament in the nation played in its original city. Nat Emerson and Tony Trabert The Club has had a number of nationally ranked players, the first being Nat Emerson who won the Tri-State Tournament when it was first played in 1899, and was a finalist several times afterward. He was ranked No. 7 in Men's Singles by the USTA in 1908. Another nationally prominent player in the early years was Reuben A. Holden, Jr., who won the NCAA Singles Championship in 1910 while a student at Yale University. It was 41 years later in 1951, when Club member Tony Trabert playing for the University of Cincinnati won the NCAA Singles title. Barry MacKay of Dayton also won the NCAA Singles title in 1957, while at the University of Michigan. Trabert was one of the most prominent players in the modern history of tennis. He played on the United States Davis Cup team and was later the captain. He won the French singles twice, 1954-55 as well as the Wimbledon and U.S. singles in 1955, making him one of only nine men in tennis history to have won three of the four major titles in a calendar year. He was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1970. Court 2 at the tennis club has been dedicated in his honor. Bill Talbert was ranked in the U.S. Top 10 13 times between 1941 & 1954. He won nine Grand Slam doubles titles, and also reached the men's doubles finals of the U.S. National Championship nine times. He also was a Davis Cup player and one of the most successful Davis Cup captains in U.S. history. He was enshrined into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1967 and was in the first class, along with his former prot√©g√© Tony Trabert, enshrined into the Cincinnati Tennis Hall of Fame. After his playing career, he was Tournament Director of the US Open. Talbert and Trabert were both coached by Howard Zaeh, as well as many hundreds of others who went on to play around the world. Davis Cup Throughout this long period the Club continued to bring world class players and teams to Cincinnati, including a Davis Cup tie in 1952, the first ever to be played here. All this activity did much to further the interest in tennis in Cincinnati and in the Ohio Valley area. Prominent Members In addition to a number of outstanding players, CTC has had distinguished and prominent citizens in its membership. To name a few, William Howard Taft, 27th President of the United States and later Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; Potter Stewart, Justice of the Supreme court; Neil McElroy, Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration and President and Chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company. Too numerous to mention are other members who have been leaders in the business community, medical, legal and teaching professions. From 1993 to 1995, member J. Howard \\"Bumpy\\" Frazer served as president of the USTA - the first Cincinnatian ever to direct the national organization. Another member, Alvin Bunis, founded the first tennis senior tour‚Äîthe first senior tour in either tennis or golf. National Register of Historic Places CTC has occupied its present site at Dexter and Wold Avenues since 1899, and on March 29, 1983 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of Interior for its leadership in the development and advancement of the sport of tennis in the Cincinnati and Ohio Valley Area.

The Paunacussing Creek also called Fleecydale runs through Carversville and meets the Delaware River at Lumberville. By 1730, roads had been formed into Carversville's dense forests so that settlers could haul out wool and farm produce and bring in lumber that had been rafted down the Delaware River from northern Pennsylvania. Carversville was originally called Indian Village, though was later named Mill Town for the presence of its mills. Its name was later contracted into Milton before finally, in 1833, being renamed Carversville in honor of the first postmaster,Richardson, John.

Carversville was a center of commerce from its inception, and boasted enterprises such as Stovers Mill, Fretz Mill, Carver Mill, Suggin Bag Manufactury, a sash and blind mill, and the famous Roram Hat factory. In 1859, the Excelsior Normal Institute was founded on the hill that overlooks the village. This five-story stone building became a well-known school which turned out scholars until it fell on hard times in the late nineteenth century. When teaching ended, pleasure began as the building became a resort. However, its lifespan was also short-lived. The final use for the property was as the Carversville Christian Orphanage. The building was razed in the mid-1900s. Today, Carversville is home to some 100 residents, and is protected by a Historic District Ordinance which prevents the area from being marred by overdevelopment of new homes and businesses. The center of Carversville, nicknamed the Town Square is home to the Carversville Inn, a restaurant which dates back to 1813, the dental office of Dr. Howard Barsky, and the Carversville General Store. The Historic Carversville Society maintains an active schedule full of events for its residents, which includes Carversville Day (a town fair that includes the famed \\"pet parade\\"), Films in the Field (dated movies shown once per month during the summer that are projected on the side of the General Store), and carolling in the Square (where villagers gather in the Town Square to sing Christmas carols and visit Santa Claus). Carversville was home to noted artist Charles Hargens famous for his cover art. Mr. Hargens painted covers for The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, The Open Road for Boys and many western novels of the 1930s and 1940s.

It was once the prime basketball facility for Baylor University. The H.O.T Coliseum was constructed after McLennan County voters authorized a bond issue of $1.2 million in the early 1950s. Despite public criticism that might be directed toward the board and individual members, it was the board's unanimous decision to build portions of the entire plant that the available money would permit. The last of five contracts was signed on January 9, 1952, and construction of the Coliseum began soon afterward. The Coliseum, livestock barn, ticket booths and several small buildings were constructed, paving was done and fencing enclosed the grounds. In the spring of 1953, the Coliseum was completed, and on April 11, the formal opening was held. The Coliseum remained home to Bears basketball, and Waco's largest concert venue, until Ferrell Center was built in 1988. All facilities and grounds of the Fair Complex underwent renovations and/or reconstruction throughout the years of 2000 to 2005. The Complex now covers of land containing modernized facilities, 700 stalls, 250 RV hook-ups and parking areas able to accommodate over 3800 vehicles. Its facilities consist of the Heart O‚Äô Texas Coliseum, Back Porch Club, Show Pavilion, General Exhibits Building, Creative Arts Building and the recently constructed Stall Barn. The Events Center coliseum seats 6,000 for rodeos and up to 9,000 for concerts. In August 2010, officials announced that Extraco Banks signed a long-term naming rights deal, officially changing the name of the grounds to the Extraco Events Center. The Heart O' Texas Fair & Rodeo, held for a week in October, is its largest attraction of the year, hosting a PRCA rodeo event and accompanying fair, which attract hundreds of thousands. The Extraco Events Center also hosts yearly events such as the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey circus, Monster Trucks, major concert acts, and has also hosted WWE Monday Night Raw on several occasions.

Traditionally, MacConkey agar has been used to distinguish those bacteria that ferment lactose from those that do not. This is important because gut bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, can typically ferment lactose, while important gut pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica and most shigellas are unable to ferment lactose. Shigella sonnei can ferment lactose, but only after prolonged incubation, so it is referred to as a late- lactose fermenter. During fermentation of the sugar, acid is formed and the pH of the medium drops, changing the color of the pH indicator. Different formulations use different indicators; neutral red is often used. For example, lactose fermenters turn a deep red when this pH indicator is used. Those bacteria unable to ferment lactose, often referred to as nonlactose fermenters, or NLFs for short, use the peptone in the medium. This releases ammonia, which raises the pH of the medium. Although some authors refer to NLFs as being colourless, in reality they turn neutral red a buffish color. E. coli O157:H7 differs from most other strains of E. coli in being unable to ferment sorbitol. In sorbitol MacConkey agar, lactose is replaced by sorbitol. Non-pathogenic strains of E. coli ferment sorbitol to produce acid: Pathogenic E. coli cannot ferment sorbitol, so this strain uses peptone to grow. This raises the pH of the medium, allowing the pathogenic strain to be differentiated from other non-pathogenic E.coli strains through the action of the pH indicator in the medium.

As with both of those games, it is played in a swimming pool with snorkeling equipment (mask, snorkel, and fins). The goal of the game is to manoeuvre (by carrying and passing) a slightly negatively buoyant ball from one side of a pool to the other by players who are completely submerged underwater. Scoring is achieved by placing the ball (under control) in the gutter on the side of the pool. Variations include using a toy rubber torpedo as the ball, and weighing down buckets to rest on the bottom and serve as goals. It is played in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan.  Origins  Underwater football was developed in the 1960s by Dave Murdoch, a scuba diving instructor who was teaching in the Manitoba's Frank Kennedy Centre. The game developed from a \\"keep-away\\" training exercise that used a pool brick to develop the students snorkelling skills. It is still played there today.  Rules  Several ball types have been used throughout the game's history. These include a 10-pound pool brick, a junior sized NFL-style football, and a junior sized basketball, all with negative buoyancy. Pneumatic balls (such as the football or basketball) can be made negatively buoyant by filling them with a liquid that is denser (heavier) than water instead of air, e.g. a strong saline solution or corn syrup. The sport is similar to water polo, but it is played most of the time underwater. Each player can go up to the surface to take air as many times needed, except when he has the football in his hand. Like the traditional football, one player from each team manoeuvre the ball past their opponents to get to the ball to goal. Each team has 13 players, but only five players are on the court at same time. The player with the ball can swim with it or pass the ball to his team players. Meanwhile, the opponents will try to take the ball from the other player or intercept a pass. And at last the team which has the maximum scores will win. The court is 10 metres wide (32 ft), long, and deep. A match has two 20-minute rounds, and a half-time of 5 minutes.  Governing body  The governing body is the Manitoba Underwater Council (MUC). The MUC also supports competition by providing insurance required for the hire of swimming pools as well as sponsoring the cost of hire.

Manziel, a former amateur boxer, manager of boxer Buddy Turman, and close friend of World heavyweight Champion Jack Dempsey, was a successful businessman who dreamed of a 20,000 seat complex in East Texas. His vision would have been the only all-year air-conditioned stadium in the U.S. Dempsey even agreed to relocate and help manage the center. Unfortunately, Manziel died in 1956 and the 56,000 square-foot building's construction came to a halt. In 1981, Bobby Manziel, Jr. picked up where his father left off by converting the unfinished arena into what it is today. In November 1983, after years of remodeling, the construction was complete and thousands attended the opening ceremony to watch Barbara Mandrell perform.http://www.oilpalace.com/concerts-in-tyler-texas.php On March 10, 2018, a $2 million renovation was unveiled for a concert starring Jamey Johnson.

Carolina Environmental Study Group, 438 U.S. 59 (1978), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court overturned the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina's decision that the Price Anderson Act violated equal protection by treating victims of nuclear accidents differently from the victims of other industrial accidents.. Background Several groups filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, regarding the Price Anderson Act. The suit challenged it on two grounds; it violated the Fifth Amendment because it did not ensure adequate compensation for victims of accidents, and it violated the Fourteenth Amendment because it treated nuclear accidents differently from other accidents. Decision The Court found that the differential treatments of industrial victims did not constitute a violation of equal protection, based on the reasons Congress gave for liability limitations: \\"There is no equal protection violation, since the general rationality of the Act's liability limitation, particularly with reference to the congressional purpose of encouraging private participation in the exploitation of nuclear energy, is ample justification for the difference in treatment between those injured in nuclear accidents and those whose injuries are derived from other causes.\\" The court summarised the circumstances leading up to the act: *\\"Private industry responded to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 with the development of an experimental power plant constructed under the auspices of a consortium of interested companies. It soon became apparent that profits from the private exploitation of atomic energy were uncertain and the accompanying risks substantial. Although the AEC offered incentives to encourage investment, there remained in the path of the private nuclear power industry various problems - the risk of potentially vast liability in the event of a nuclear accident of a sizable magnitude being the major obstacle. Notwithstanding comprehensive testing and study, the uniqueness of this form of energy production made it impossible totally to rule out the risk of a major nuclear accident resulting in extensive damage. Private industry and the AEC were confident that such a disaster would not occur, but the very uniqueness of nuclear power meant that the possibility remained, and the potential liability dwarfed the ability of the industry and private insurance companies to absorb the risk. Thus, while repeatedly stressing that the risk of a major nuclear accident was extremely remote, spokesmen for the private sector informed Congress that they would be forced to withdraw from the field if their liability were not limited by appropriate legislation.\\"Duke Power Co., 438 U.S. at 63-64. The court also concluded: *\\"...it is clear that Congress' purpose was to remove the economic impediments in order to stimulate the private development of electric energy by nuclear power while simultaneously providing the public compensation in the event of a catastrophic nuclear incident.\\"Duke Power Co., 438 U.S. at 83. *\\"The record supports the need for the imposition of a statutory limit on liability to encourage private industry participation and hence bears a rational relationship to Congress' concern for stimulating private industry's involvement in the production of nuclear electric energy.Duke Power Co., 438 U.S. at 84. *the Price-Anderson Act does, in our view, provide a reasonably just substitute for the common-law or state tort law remedies it replaces.\\"Duke Power Co., 438 U.S. at 88. *\\"The District Court's finding that the Act tends to encourage irresponsibility in matters of safety and environmental protection cannot withstand careful scrutiny, since nothing in the liability-limitation provision undermines or alters the rigor and integrity of the process involved in the review of applications for a license to construct or operate a nuclear power plant, and since, in the event of a nuclear accident the utility itself would probably suffer the largest damages.\\"Duke Power Co., 438 U.S. at 87. *\\"We view the congressional assurance of a [then] $560 million fund for recovery, accompanied by an express statutory commitment, to 'take whatever action is deemed necessary [438 U.S. 59, 91] and appropriate to protect the public from the consequences of' a nuclear accident, 42 U.S.C. 2210(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), to be a fair and reasonable substitute for the uncertain recovery of damages of this magnitude from a utility or component manufacturer, whose resources might well be exhausted at an early stage.\\"Duke Power Co., 438 U.S. at 90-91. *\\"There is no equal protection violation, since the general rationality of the Act's liability limitation, particularly with reference to the congressional purpose of encouraging private participation in the exploitation of nuclear energy, is ample justification for the difference in treatment between those injured in nuclear accidents and those whose injuries are derived from other causes.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 438 References External links * 1978 in the environment 1978 in United States case law Duke Energy United States energy case law United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court ","title":"Duke Power Co. v.

Born a princess, she was a courageous queen whose fame contributed to the victory of the Yoruba people over a neighbouring people. Moremi was Oranmiya son of Oduduwa, the Yoruba's Ile Ife first king. Biography The Ayaba Moremi lived in the 12th century, hailed from Offa, and was married to Oranmiyan, the heir to the king of Ife and founding father of the Yoruba people, Oduduwa. Ile-Ife was a kingdom that was said to have been at war with an adjoining tribe who were known to them as the Forest people. (√ågb√≤ in the Yoruba language, though the said tribe is believed by scholars to have had no relation to the contemporary √ågb√≤s of modern Nigeria). Scores of Ife citizens were being enslaved by these people, and because of this they were generally regarded with disdain by the Yoruba city-states. Although the people of Ile-Ife were furious about these raids, they did not have the means to defend themselves. This is because the invaders were seen as spirits by the people of Ife, appearing as masquerades completely covered in raffia leaves. Moremi was a very brave and beautiful woman who, in order to deal with the problem facing her people, pledged a great sacrifice to the Spirit of the river Esimirin so that she could discover the strength of her nation's enemies.. She is said to have been taken as a slave by the Igbo and, due to her beauty and Esimirin's help, married their ruler as his anointed queen. After familiarizing herself with the secrets of her new husband's army, she escaped to Ile-Ife and revealed this to the Yorubas, who were then able to subsequently defeat them in battle. Following the war she returned to her first husband, King Oramiyan of Ife (and later Oyo), who immediately had her re-instated as his queen. Moremi returned to the Esimirin River to fulfill her pledge. The river demanded she sacrificed her only son, Oluorogbo. The demand was inconceivable and Moremi pleaded with the god for a less terrible offering. But in the end, she kept her promise and paid the price. The offering of Oluorogbo to the river god grieved not only Moremi but the whole kingdom of Ife. The Yoruba people consoled Moremi by offering to be her eternal children‚Äî-a promise kept until today. Legacy The Edi Festival is said to have then been started as a means of celebrating the sacrifice the princess made for the people of Yorubaland. Furthermore, a number of public places are named after her in contemporary Nigeria, such as Moremi High School and the female residence halls at the University of Lagos and Obafemi Awolowo University. In 2017, Oba Ogunwusi, the Ooni of Ile Ife, Osun State, erected a statue of Moremi in his palace. The statue is the tallest in Nigeria, displacing the previous holder of that record (a statue in Owerri, the Imo State capital). It is also the fourth tallest in Africa.

It seems that by then the old walls were in poor condition and repairing them was not viable. Moreover, their considerable length of 1.8km required more defenders than were available. The new city had an area of 1/4 of the original city enclosing little more than military buildings and churches, following a very common trend for the cities of that century in the Danube area.Liebeschuetz (2001), 77 The larger area of the extensive ruins (21.55 hectares) of the classical Nicopolis was not reoccupied. The south wall of the old city was reconstructed as the north wall of the new one. Its towers were built upon destroyed and abandoned buildings, and ornamented stone blocks from their facades were used in the new structures. The towers were about 15m in front of the 10m high wall. The outside of the wall was rendered with mortar with incised grooves imitating massive stone blocks. The old south gate later also underwent a major reconstruction to compensate for higher surrounding terrain as the gate was situated in a hollow.Ivan Tsarov: \\"Ulpia Nicopolis ad Istrum ~ Cultural and Historical Heritage Library\\" Slavena Publishing House, Varna, 2009, The town became an episcopal centre during the early Byzantine period.

Archaeology Aqueduct source octagonal collection basin Aqueduct underground source The classical town was planned according to the orthogonal system. The network of streets, the forum surrounded by an Ionic colonnade and many buildings, a two-nave room later turned into a basilica and other public buildings have been uncovered. The rich architectures and sculptures show a similarity with those of the ancient towns in Asia Minor. The agora contained a statue of Trajan on horseback as well as other marble statues and an Ionic colonnade. The city also had a three-nave basilica, a bouleuterion, a temple of Cybele, a small odeon, thermae (public baths) as well as a unique Roman building inscribed with termoperiatos, a heated building with shops and enclosed space for walks and business meetings. Some town houses and buildings have also been excavated. A unique public building, a thermoperipatos, has been identified only in Nicopolis ad Istrum so far, out of all cities in Roman Empire. It occupied a whole insula and was built under Commodus in 184-5 on the ruins of an earlier building. It was probably used for tradng and included shops. It was ruined in the 4th c. and another building later built over it. The city was supplied by three aqueducts and had several water wells, many of which have been unearthed in archaeological excavations. The western aqueduct of 25km length had a bridge of almost 3km long and almost 20m tall carrying water over the entire valley of the Rositsa River.Ivan Tsarov: ‚ÄúThe Aqueducts in the Bulgarian Lands, 2nd-4th century AD‚Äù Its 2nd century water catchment reservoir is located near the town of Musina in Pavlikeni municipality, to the west of the Roman city, where it still collects water from the karst springs inside the Musina Cave.

A simple Bayesian model of written text contains only the dictionary of legal words and their relative probabilities. A Markovian model adds the relative transition probabilities that given one word, predict what the next word will be. It is based on the theory of Markov chains by Andrey Markov, hence the name. In essence, a Bayesian filter works on single words alone, while a Markovian filter works on phrases or entire sentences. There are two types of Markov models; the visible Markov model, and the hidden Markov model or HMM. The difference is that with a visible Markov model, the current word is considered to contain the entire state of the language model, while a hidden Markov model hides the state and presumes only that the current word is probabilistically related to the actual internal state of the language. For example, in a visible Markov model the word \\"the\\" should predict with accuracy the following word, while in a hidden Markov model, the entire prior text implies the actual state and predicts the following words, but does not actually guarantee that state or prediction. Since the latter case is what's encountered in spam filtering, hidden Markov models are almost always used. In particular, because of storage limitations, the specific type of hidden Markov model called a Markov random field is particularly applicable, usually with a clique size of between four and six tokens.

It is also used within a number of household disinfectants and wound cleaners. It is less effective than some other available agents. It is available as a liquid.  History  Chloroxylenol was first made in 1927. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is sold in a number of formulations and under a number of brand names, including Dettol. Soon after it was created parachlorometaxylenol was then called PCMX, but this was thought to be a poor name and it was renamed Dettol. Then in 1932 it was marketed in Britain and in India. It had a white on green bottle with a white sword depicted.C.S.G. Krishnamacharyulu It is sold, in the same style bottle, in Argentina and Uruguay to this day.  Properties  Side effects are generally few but can include skin irritation. It may be used mixed with water or alcohol. Chloroxylenol is most effective against gram-positive bacteria. It works by disruption of the cell wall and stopping the function of enzymes.  Uses  Chloroxylenol is used in hospitals and households for disinfection and sanitation. It is also commonly used in antibacterial soaps, wound-cleansing applications and household antiseptics such as Dettol liquid (to which it contributes its distinctive odor), cream and ointments.  Side effects  Chloroxylenol is not significantly toxic to humans, is practically non-toxic to birds, and is moderately toxic to freshwater invertebrates. It is highly toxic to fish, cats, and some amphibians and should not be used around them.Dettol liquid at drugs.com It is a mild skin irritant and may trigger allergic reactions in some individuals. =Humans= Excessive exposure to chloroxylenol has the potential for causing death. It can be poisonous when swallowed and even when it is unintentionally inhaled. A medical study in Hong Kong which analyzed 177 cases of Dettol ingestion that resulted in emergency department treatment (95% of which were intentional), concluded that \\"Dettol poisoning resulted in serious complications in 7% of patients, including death.\\" = Animals = Chloroxylenol is toxic to many animals, especially cats. Phenolic compounds are of particular concern because cats are unable to fully metabolize them. A cat may swallow the product by licking its paws after they have come into contact with it. In Australia, chloroxylenol spray has been shown to be lethal to cane toads, an invasive species that was introduced from Hawaii as a result of bad judgment in 1935. It had been hoped that the amphibian would control the cane beetle but it became highly destructive within the ecosystem. Spraying the disinfectant at close range has been shown to cause rapid death to toads. It is not known whether the toxins are persistent or whether they harm other Australian flora and fauna. Owing to concerns over potential harm to other Australian wildlife species, the use of chloroxylenol as an agent for pest control was banned in Western Australia by the Department of Environment and Conservation in 2011.  Society and culture  A number of brand names are available. Chloroxylenol is the active ingredient in Dettol. It comprises 4.8% of Dettol's total admixture, with the rest made up by pine oil, isopropanol, castor oil, soap and water.

Its tagline is that \\"It's not about weight limits, it's about no limits!\\" History The high-flying, high risk style of wrestling had become one of the features of World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling in the late 1990s. Rather than emphasizing the fact that most wrestlers who perform this style are under 220 lb (100 kg) by calling it a cruiserweight division, TNA decided to emphasize the high-risk nature of the stunt like moves that the wrestlers performed only in TNA where no restraints were placed on them. As such, according to Bob Ryder in The History of TNA: Year 1, they named the division after the X Games. Until 2011, there was no upper weight limit on the X Division or its title, though in practice, most of the wrestlers in this division were cruiserweights, with Sonny Siaki, Samoa Joe, Kurt Angle, and Abyss being notable exceptions. To further emphasize this point, the slogan \\"It's not about weight limits, it's about no limits\\" was used to describe the division. On the August 11, 2011, edition of Impact Wrestling, TNA authority figure Eric Bischoff announced that X Division would have a weight limit of . However, when Hulk Hogan became the new on screen GM in March 2012, the weight limit was quietly repealed, as heavier wrestlers like former champion Samoa Joe and eventual champion Rob Van Dam were able to compete for the title. On the March 21, 2013, episode of Impact Wrestling, new rules were implemented for the X Division: # A 230 lb. weight limit # All matches will be triple threat matches # In championship matches, whoever gets pinned or is made to submit would be ineligible for the next championship match, while the one who does not will be a challenger for the next X Division match. On the April 18, 2013, episode of Impact Wrestling, a new feature called the X Cam was introduced, giving viewers a first-person look at every X Division match. On the August 22, 2013, episode of Impact Wrestling, it was announced that the triple threat match rule had been revoked and that X Division matches may also be contested under one on one matches again. On October 20, 2013, at Bound for Glory, 280 lb. Samoa Joe took part in a five-man Ultimate X match for the X Division Championship. This indicated that the 230 lb. weight limit was also quietly revoked. Reception The X Division was generally regarded as one of the key attractions of TNA. Due to TNA focusing more on the heavyweight and main event picture, the X Division has been placed on the back-burner in recent memory. A 2005 three-way match between Christopher Daniels, Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles was given the rare rating of 5 stars by the Wrestling Observer. One of the most intense feuds in the X Division was between A.J. Styles, Christopher Daniels, and Samoa Joe. The feud started when Joe won the 2005 Super X Cup, becoming one of the best wrestlers in the division. Both Daniels and Styles disliked Joe, despite having had a feud of their own. Tournaments TNA maintains three different styles of tournament referred to as \\"X Cup\\" tournaments. The Super X Cup tournament is a standard single-elimination tournament featuring one-on-one matches. The Americas X Cup tournament was a team-format points-based tournament featuring two teams of four wrestlers each, with each team representing a respective country that most or all of the wrestlers are from. Members of the team competed in a variety of matches, including singles matches and tag team matches, which accrued points for their side. The World X Cup tournament was an expansion on the Americas X Cup, in which four teams of four wrestlers competed. In the World X Cup, TNA always hosts a home team for the United States, with other countries such as Japan, Mexico, and Canada being represented by either TNA-contracted wrestlers or wrestlers from a promotion that TNA has a partnership agreement with. X Division wrestlers are generally the only TNA wrestlers that compete in the TNA X Cup Tournaments. The first such tournament was the TNA 2003 Super X Cup Tournament, which was won by Chris Sabin. Ultimate X Match The Ultimate X match is the signature gimmick match of the X Division. It is similar to a ladder match except that two cables attached to truss towers adjacent to the ring posts cross above the center of the ring and the item of value is hung at the intersection of the cables. The winner is the competitor who can retrieve the item of value from the cables. It was originally created in August 2003 and pitted Michael Shane, Frankie Kazarian, and Chris Sabin. Since then, twenty-four Ultimate X matches have taken place, some for the X Division championship, some for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, and some with a giant red X suspended above the ring symbolizing something such as number one contender status, and even the X Division title itself.

In addition to large collections of alpine plants, rhododendrons, primulas, and lilies, it was known for its plant-conservation program and its large seed bank that protects rare or endangered plants of the Pacific Northwest. The seed bank, formally established in 1983, was thought to be the first in the U.S. that was devoted entirely to preserving rare native plants. The garden, created in the 1930s by Portland resident Rae Selling Berry, was bought after her death in 1976 by The Friends of Berry Botanic Garden, a nonprofit corporation. Managed by a Board of Directors, the Berry estate had an area of , and contained the largest public rock garden on the West Coast. In January 2010, The Berry Botanic Garden Board of Directors announced plans to sell the property and close the garden because of funding problems. The property was sold in February 2011, and in November 2011 the BBG conservation program and seed bank, now known as the Rae Selling Berry Seed Bank & Plant Conservation Program, completed the transfer to the Environmental Science and Management Program at Portland State University. History The garden began in the 1930s as the personal collection of Rae Selling Berry (1881-1976), who obtained seeds from plant explorers including Frank Kingdon- Ward, Francis Ludlow and George Sherriff, and Joseph Rock. She also collected alpine plants herself from the mountains of the Western United States, British Columbia, and Alaska. In 1938 she established the garden's current site, and the garden became a public, nonprofit organization in 1978. She had a two- story Bungalow style home built at the location in 1939, which was designed by Reuben T. Sinex. Berry, the daughter of Ben Selling and Mathilda Hess, grew up in Portland and married Alfred Berry, a contractor who became the superintendent of Portland International Airport. For more than 30 years, the couple and their three children lived in northeast Portland's Irvington neighborhood, where Berry developed an interest in plants. Reading about plant expeditions to Europe and Asia, she began to provide financial support for the expeditions and through them to obtain seeds. By the mid-1930s, Berry had run out of room for her plants in Irvington, and the couple moved to \\"a bowl- shaped site nestled near the top of a hill\\". The property, just north of Lake Oswego, included springs and creeks, a ravine, a meadow, and a cattail marsh, and was partly covered with second-growth Douglas-fir. In developing the garden, Berry focused on \\"exceptional plants\\", particularly rhododendrons, primulas, and alpines. In 1964, the Garden Club of America awarded her the Florens de Bevoise Medal for her knowledge of plants. In 1965, she won the American Rhododendron Society's first Award of Excellence given to a woman, and she was honored for her work by the American Rock Garden Society. Berry continued to expand her collection past the age of 80, taking field trips in search of Oregon's only primrose, Primula cusickiana (Cusick's Primrose). At age 90, she was still planting seeds in the gardens, and died at home at age 96. In 1978, two years after Berry's death, The Friends of The Berry Botanic Garden, a nonprofit corporation, bought the estate. Donations to a $300,000 fund drive to make the purchase possible included $10,000 from the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust in Scotland as well as support from plant societies, the American Rhododendron Society, and the Oregon branch of The Nature Conservancy. The Friends stated mission was \\"to preserve, maintain, disseminate, study and add appropriate plant material to the collections.\\" By 1983, the discovery that 39 native species in the garden were rare or endangered species led to the creation of the Seed Bank for Rare and Endangered Species of the Pacific Northwest. This was thought to be the first seed bank in the U.S. devoted entirely to preserving rare native plants. The seed bank consists of more than 14,000 accessions (packages of seed) from more than 300 rare or endangered plants of the Pacific Northwest. The garden and home at the garden were added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2002 as the Rae Selling Berry Garden and House. In January 2010, The Friends, citing financial problems, decided to sell the garden but to preserve the conservation program with help from Portland State University (PSU). Collections The garden continued to develop after it became a nonprofit organization. Its major collections included primulas (commonly called primroses), many of which started from seeds from Asian plant expeditions augmented by international seed exchanges. Primroses are found mainly in mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Berry produced several varieties of her own including \\"Snow Lady\\" and \\"Purple Spark\\". Another major collection consisted of high-mountain alpine and subalpine plants. Keeping the most delicate specimens in cold frames or in log beds behind the house, Berry expanded her collection through exchanges with other gardeners, her own expeditions, and from plant explorers in Asia. The log-bed section of the garden gave way after 1980 to a rock garden with an alpine bog. Insiders' Guide to Portland calls it \\"the largest public rock garden on the West Coast\\". Rhododendrons made up a third major collection. Many of the seeds, acquired from plant explorers in Asia, began their lives on the Berry family's prior home in Irvington and were transplanted to the garden. Berry's collection grew to include more than 2,000 specimens representing 160 species. Dwarf species grew in the rock garden, and two species, R. decorum and R. calophytum, formed a forest of more than 150 mature plants. Native plants from the Pacific Northwest comprised a fourth major collection, which included about 200 of the roughly 5,000 native plants in the region. These plants were found in all parts of the garden, especially along a native-plant trail, in the rock garden, and in the water garden. Lilies made up a fifth major collection started in 1979 when the garden's board of directors decided to provide sanctuary for many species of the genus Lilium found in the wild in the Northwest and along the West Coast. The lilies were stored as seed or planted in suitable locations throughout the garden.

Biography Born Al Albertini in Chester, Pennsylvania, United States, he went to South Philadelphia High School. As a teenager, he appeared on the Horn and Hardart Children's Hour, a radio program. After graduating from South Philadelphia High, he went to Temple University and the United States Navy, where he met Dave Mahoney. They went on to found The Four Aces. The Four Aces recorded the song \\"Three Coins in the Fountain\\", written by Jule Styne for the film of the same name. The song hit the No. 1 bestselling record twice in 1954, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song the same year. Alberts also popularized the song \\"On the Way to Cape May\\", first through recording it, and then by performing it often on his later television show and specials. The Four Aces biggest hit was \\"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing\\", which was the theme to the 1955 film starring William Holden and Jennifer Jones. The song was a number one hit for four weeks, and it also won the Academy Award for best song. In 1960 he recorded On The Way To Cape May, a song that has become a Jersey Shore sound summertime anthem for the Philadelphia/Delaware Valley and South Jersey Shore area. It was written by Maurice \\"Buddy\\" Nugent according to BMI and The Philadelphia Inquirer. The song became popular without the push of a major record label. It has become popular in a variety of 21st century media, such as XM satellite and internet radio, and also enjoys regular airplay on many Delaware Valley AM and FM stations. Subsequently, he became a television personality in Philadelphia where he hosted a one-hour Saturday afternoon talent show, called Al Alberts Showcase, first airing on WKBS-TV, and then on WPVI-TV that featured a panel of local children known as the \\"Teeny Boppers.\\" Also there was a group of young teenage dancers called the \\"Show Stoppers.\\" Local talents of all ages would sing songs and perform dance routines. Alberts would sit with the Teeny Boppers and they would each tell him a joke. The show helped launch the careers of Andrea McArdle, and such acts/performers as Sister Sledge, The Kinleys, and Teddy Pendergrass. After 32 years, the show went off the air after Alberts' retirement in 2001. Death and legacy Alberts died at his home in Arcadia, Florida of complications from renal failure.

He is noted for his long association with the Metropolitan Opera, in which he served as General Manager from 1990 to 2006. In all, he spent 42 years working at the Met in various capacities, rising rapidly to managerial positions. Since February 2016 he has been Executive Director of the Sarasota Ballet.  Early life  Volpe was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an Italian family. While living in Long Island, he opened his own auto mechanic business in high school. After a fire at the auto garage, he worked as a theatrical carpenter on Broadway. In lieu of college, Volpe joined the Metropolitan Opera in August 1964 as an apprentice carpenter.  Career at the Metropolitan Opera  =Rise from carpenter= Volpe became the Metropolitan Opera's master carpenter in 1966, having joined the company's carpentry division in 1964 as an apprentice. He became Technical Director of the Met in 1978. In 1981 he was appointed Assistant Manager of the Met, and retained that position for 9 years. His accomplishments in that capacity included managing the company's re-entry into the commercial recording field. Volpe became the opera's General Manager in August 1990. He was the first head of the Metropolitan Opera to advance from within the ranks of the company's management. =Artistic management= As general manager, Volpe reduced the number of operas repeating from prior seasons and increased the overall length of the season. During his tenure, several world premieres were given, including commissions made under his aegis, such as Tan Dun's The First Emperor, presented in the 2006‚Äì07 season. The Met's repertory further expanded with 22 works given their Met premieres during Volpe's 16 seasons as general manager ‚Äì more new works than under any general manager since Giulio Gatti- Casazza, who ran the company from 1908 to 1935. Volpe expanded the Met's international touring activities. The company visited Spain's Expo '92, Germany in 1994, and Japan in 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2006. In addition, under Volpe, frequent tours and recordings of symphonic repertoire by the Met orchestra were inaugurated, as well as an annual series at Carnegie Hall. The orchestra made European concert tours in 1996 and 1999, and a tour of the United States in 1998. In August 2002, the orchestra gave concerts at the Salzburg Festival, the Lucerne Festival, the Baden-Baden Festival and the Rheingau Musik Festival. In 1994, Volpe terminated the contract of star soprano Kathleen Battle, due to repeated disruptive behavior.Kozinn, Allan. \\"The Met Drops Kathleen Battle, Citing 'Unprofessional Actions.'\\" The New York Times, February 8, 1994. Future engagements with Battle were canceled as well. Volpe named Russian conductor Valery Gergiev as the company's Principal Guest Conductor in 1997. In 1998, Volpe instituted an education project for young children in cooperation with the New York City Department of Education and endowed by the Texaco Foundation. The program emphasizes direct experience with music and opera for students in New York City schools. The children come to the Metropolitan Opera House for backstage tours, followed by attendance at dress rehearsals, and artists from the Metropolitan Opera are frequently sent to participating schools for educational presentations. Volpe also established a partnership with the University of Connecticut that provides students from the music and drama departments with behind-the-scenes access to the creative processes taking place in the opera house. The Met outreach under Volpe also included the \\"Cultural Passport\\" program with the City University of New York (CUNY), offering a special program for honors students and teachers-in- training to familiarize them with opera. =Technical innovations= Volpe conceived and developed \\"Met Titles\\", which were introduced during the 1995‚Äì96 season opening night performance of Otello. This system provides individual screens for surtitles screens on the backs of the seats for those members of the audience who wish to utilize them, but with little distraction for those who do not. In 1998, Volpe initiated the development of a new management software program, called Tessitura. Tessitura uses a single database of information to record, track and manage all contacts with the Met's constituents, conduct targeted marketing and fund raising appeals, handle all ticketing and membership transactions, and provide detailed and flexible performance reports. Beginning in 2000, Tessitura was offered under license to other arts organizations, and it is now used by a network of more than 200 opera companies, symphony orchestras, ballet companies, theater companies, performing arts centers, and museums in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. =Fiscal management and marketing= Sound fiscal management and various marketing initiatives, permitting the Met to maintain high musical and production standards, characterized Volpe's tenure. In addition, Volpe's customer care initiative, begun in 1996, steadily improved the Met's responsiveness to its customers' needs. Volpe inaugurated consumer-friendly services like automated ticket sales, varied subscription packages, and a more liberal ticket exchange policy. Volpe strengthened the Met's administration through a re-organization, naming assistant managers responsible to the general manager for specific areas of operations. Labor relations under Volpe's management were without significant contract disputes for over two decades, the longest period of labor peace in the company's history. In fact, Volpe's successor Peter Gelb hired him in February 2010 to represent the Met in its various negotiations with labor unions.\\"Volpe to Lead Labor Talks at the Met.\\" Volpe successfully opposed major aspects of Lincoln Center's 21st-century redevelopment plans: a proposal to build a glass dome over the entire plaza and plans to construct a new theater for the New York City Opera in Damrosch Park. In Volpe's view, Lincoln Center needed refurbishing, but not a drastic redesign costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Although the Met suffered the ill effects experienced by most arts organizations in New York City of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, sound fiscal management, including marketing initiatives and continued strong fundraising, permitted the Met to maintain its high musical and production standards. To ensure affordable access to Met performances for a broad range customers, Volpe maintained a wide variety of ticket prices and subscription packages. =Retirement= In February 2004, Volpe announced his intention to retire, citing a desire to spend time on the personal interests which he had neglected while at his \\"all-consuming\\" position at the Met.\\"Volpe to Retire as General Manager of Metropolitan Opera.\\" Associated Press, February 10, 2004. On August 1, 2006, Peter Gelb became his successor as general manager. Career outside the Met Volpe has been a guest lecturer at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, as well as at the \\"Models of Leadership\\" course for New York University's Stern School of Business, where he teaches a course entitled \\"Managing in the Performing Arts\\". After leaving the Met, Volpe joined Giuliani Partners, the firm founded by the former New York City mayor after he left office, as a senior vice president. His job was to bring in cultural clients, manage noncultural projects, and draw on the many contacts he made through opera. However, Volpe missed working in theatrical endeavors and left in January 2008. In 2008, he joined Theater Projects Consultants, a leading theater design firm, at its American headquarters in South Norwalk, Connecticut. Volpe was appointed Executive Director of the Sarasota Ballet in February 2016. Personal life He is married to Jean Anderson Volpe, a former ballet dancer. Together, Joseph and Jean have a daughter. The Volpe family resides in Manhattan and Sarasota. \\"New York‚Äôs Metropolitan Opera GM Relocates to Sarasota\\"  Memoir  Volpe's 2006 memoir, The Toughest Show on Earth: My Rise and Reign at the Metropolitan Opera, published by Knopf, describes his 42 years at the Met.

Jeff moved to Tampa, Florida in 1981, but soon returned New York, before moving once again to the Boston area. There, while working in a cover band with some hometown friends, he met Boston guitarist Matt Leff. Leff had been playing in a band Wicked Witch, whose lead vocalist was Zak Stevens. Wicked Witch went through a few lineup changes and had broken up at the time Matt and Jeff started playing together. Zak returned from his home in SC to Boston to reform a 2nd version of Wicked Witch. In the fall of 1992, Zak got the call to join Savatage, replacing recently departed Jon Oliva. Zak accepted and made his Savatage debut on 1993's Edge of Thorns. Wicked Witch folded soon after, as they couldn't get a replacement for Stevens. In 1993, Plate moved back to upstate New York to regroup, joining an alternative/country rock band called Voodoo Rodeo. After hearing of the death of Criss Oliva, guitarist and founding member of Savatage, Jeff called Zak Stevens to see how he was doing, and was surprised to learn that Savatage was committed to regroup and continue. Replacing drummer Steve Wacholz, he joined the band for the 'Handful Of Rain' U.S tour in the fall of '94. Plate recorded three more albums with Savatage - \\"Dead Winter Dead\\", \\"The Wake Of Magellan\\", and \\"Poets and Madmen\\". Although the band has not performed since 2012, there has been no official statement on the band's breakup. The success of the single \\"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24\\" from Dead Winter Dead lead to the formation of the Trans- Siberian Orchestra (TSO). Plate has performed on every TSO release to date, including \\"Christmas Eve and Other Stories\\", \\"The Christmas Attic\\", \\"Beethoven's Last Night\\", \\"The Lost Christmas Eve\\", \\"Nightcastle\\" and the EP \\"Dreams of Fireflies (On a Christmas Night)\\". He has performed on every Trans- Siberian Orchestra Tour, including the annual Winter Tours and several Spring Tours. In addition to his work with TSO, Plate has performed on the solo albums of fellow TSO member Chris Caffery, as well as shows with former Trans- Siberian Orchestra violinist Mark Wood and his Electrify Your Strings Program. In 2006 Plate recorded \\"Long Time No Sing\\" with vocalist John West. Plate joined American heavy metal band Metal Church in 2006. During his 11-year tenure with Metal Church, he recorded four albums and did several world tours with them. After some member changes and a brief hiatus, they reformed in 2012 and released two more albums (Generation Nothing and XI) before Plate left the band in March 2017. In 2009, Jeff would team up once more with former Savatage bandmate Zak Stevens and former Wicked Witch bandmate Matt Leff to relaunch Wicked Witch under a new moniker, Machines of Grace. They recruited bassist Chris Rapoza, re-worked and re-recorded the original Wicked Witch material and ultimately released a self-titled album. Jeff's sister Terry died in a car accident in 2003, an event Jeff said \\"changed my life‚Ä¶\\" Terry is survived by her 2 sons Bradley and Jeff. In 2008 Plate married Cathy Fracasso. Jeff currently resides in upstate New York and, when not touring with TSO, teaches privately and performs locally with his cover band RUST. Equipment Jeff uses Pearl drums, Remo drumheads, Zildjian cymbals, and Vater drumsticks.

Career Higgins started acting in school and Cosmopolitan Club theatre plays, taking the lead in 'Treasure Island', Sweeney Todd', and 'The Beggar's Uproar' (sic). After graduation he studied at the school of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company. In 1967 he became a professional stage actor. He received positive reviews for his performance as Romeo in Romeo and Juliet at Birmingham Repertory. He worked onstage in Coventry and at the Chichester Festival in Chichester. One of his first television appearances was a pivotal role in a 1968 episode of the TV series Journey to the Unknown with Janice Rule. Another television appearance was in Strange Report (1969) with Anthony Quayle. Higgins' first successes in cinema were: A Walk with Love and Death by John Huston with Anjelica Huston (1969), Something for Everyone (1970) with Michael York and Angela Lansbury, Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970), with Christopher Lee, and a cult film Vampire Circus (1972). In all the films of his early career until 1975, Higgins was credited as 'Anthony Corlan' due to the similarity of his real name to that of another actor. There followed a period of television and plays for the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre and other British theatre productions. In 1970 he played Boris in the BBC TV series The Roads to Freedom based on the Jean-Paul Sartre trilogy. In 1976 he played a supporting role in a popular British television series, Hadleigh. In 1977 he played the lead role in a BBC series The Eagle of the Ninth, based on Rosemary Sutcliff's 1954 book.Tise Vahimagi, British Television: An Illustrated Guide; In 1980 he was Juan in Love in a Cold Climate and in 1981 played the supporting role of Major Gobler in the feature film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, starring Harrison Ford and directed by Steven Spielberg. Higgins won Best Actor of 1979 from Time Out magazine for his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company that year. Higgins played the role of Stephan in the American film production of Quartet opposite French actress Isabelle Adjani in 1981. In the same year the British director Peter Greenaway chose Higgins for the leading role in his breakthrough film The Draughtsman's Contract. In 1985 Higgins appeared as the cuckolded husband in Nagisa Oshima's Max, Mon Amour with Charlotte Rampling. In 1985 he acted opposite Sting in The Bride, a version of Bride of Frankenstein. Throughout the 1980s Higgins appeared in supporting roles in many television series such as Lace, Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story, with Armand Assante, and Reilly, Ace of Spies, with Sam Neill. He went to Australia to play the lead as Sir Laurence Olivier in an Australian made-for-television film, Darlings of the Gods, about the time spent in Australia by Olivier and Vivien Leigh. In 1991 Higgins played Johann Strauss I in the Austrian-produced, made-for-television series, The Strauss Dynasty, which was filmed in Austria with many well-known actors and aired internationally. He played both Sherlock Holmes and Holmes' enemy Professor Moriarty, in two different decades of his career. He was the villain Rathe (not yet going by the name Moriarty) in Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), and played Sherlock Holmes himself in Sherlock Holmes Returns (1993). In 1993 he played a lead part in the film Sweet Killing. In 2005 he appeared in Chromophobia. He played General Jacques Francois Dugommier in 2007 in Heroes and Villains: Napoleon. In 2009 he appeared in Lewis, Law & Order: UK, and Agatha Christie's Marple (\\"The Secret of Chimneys\\").

Formerly two groups, the Shipibo and the Conibo, they eventually became one distinct tribe through intermarriage and communal ritual and are currently known as the Shipibo-Conibo people. Traditional embroidering. Shipibo-Conibo tribe. Lifestyle, tradition and diet The Shipibo-Conibo live in the 21st century while keeping one foot in the past, spanning millennia in the Amazonian rainforest. Many of their traditions are still practiced, such as ayahuasca shamanism. Shamanistic songs have inspired artistic tradition and decorative designs found in their clothing, pottery, tools and textiles. Some of the urbanized people live around Pucallpa in the Yarina Cocha, an extensive indigenous zone. Most others live in scattered villages over a large area of jungle forest extending from Brazil to Ecuador. Shipibo-Conibo women make beadwork and textiles, and are well-known for their pottery, decorated with maze-like red and black geometric patterns. While these ceramics were traditionally made for use in the home, an expanding tourist market has provided many households with extra income through the sale of pots and other craft items. They also prepare chapo, a sweet plantain beverage. The Shipibo of the village of Pao-Yan used to have a diet of fish, yuca and fruits. Recently, however, the situation has deteriorated because of global weather changes and now there is mostly just yuca and fish. Since there has been drought followed by flooding, most of the mature fruit trees have died, and some of the banana trees and plantains are struggling. Global increases in energy and food prices have risen due to deforestation and erosion along the Ucayali River. The basic needs of the people are more important now than ever, affecting their long-term planning abilities. There is now a sense that hunger may not be that far off for those in the farther reaches of the Shipibo nation. Contact with western sources ‚Äì including the governments of Peru and Brazil ‚Äì has been sporadic over the past three centuries. The Shipibo are noted for a rich and complex cosmology, which is tied directly to the art and artifacts they produce. Christian missionaries have worked to convert them since the late 17th century, particularly the Franciscans. In 2017, the Shipibo-Conibo were found to practice female genital mutilation (FGM) to make girls 'real' women, as superstition held that uncut girls could become lesbians. Population Pano-speaking ethnicities With an estimated population of over 20,000, the Shipibo-Conibo represent approximately 8% of the indigenous registered population. Census data is unreliable due to the transitory nature of the group. Large amounts of the population have relocated to urban areas ‚Äì in particular the eastern Peruvian cities of Pucallpa and Yarinacocha ‚Äì to gain access to better educational and health services, as well as to look for alternative sources of monetary income. The population numbers for this group have fluctuated in the last decades between approximately 11,000 (Wise and Ribeiro, 1978) to as many as 25,000 individuals (Hern 1994). Like all other indigenous populations in the Amazon basin, the Shipibo-Conibo are threatened by severe pressure from outside influences such as oil speculation, logging, narco-trafficking, and conservation.

It was located at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers in or near the area now known as The Forks in the city of Winnipeg. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry after the merger of North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821. History Governor of Red River, Andrew Bulger, driving his family on the frozen Red River in a horse cariole with the fort now renamed Fort Garry in the background (winter of 1822-23) In the early 19th century fur-trading was the main industry of Western Canada. Two companies had an intense competition over the trade. The first, the Hudson's Bay Company, was a London, England- based organization. The second, the North West Company, was based in Montreal. Hudson's Bay Company was distinctly English in its culture and flavour while the North West Company was a mix of French, Scottish and First Nations cultures. The voyageurs of the North West Company were a highly mobile group of fur traders. They established temporary encampments in the forks region that later became Winnipeg. In 1809 the North West Company built Fort Gibraltar. About half a mile north the Selkirk settlers and HBC employees built Fort Douglas which was started in 1813 and completed in 1815. There were many conflicts between the mostly Scottish employees of the HBC and the NWC employees, who were mostly French-Canadians and M√©tis.(see Pemmican War) On March 17, 1816, Fort Gibraltar was captured and destroyed by Robert Semple, new Governor of the Red River Colony. The action was ruled illegal by British authorities and the North West Company was given permission to rebuild the fort in 1817. On March 26, 1821, The North West Company was merged with its rival under the name of the Hudson's Bay Company. The site of the fort was designated a National Historic Site in 1924 as part of the \\"Forts Rouge, Garry, and Gibraltar National Historic Site of Canada\\". =Chronology of Fort Gibraltar= * 1809 The North West Company builds Fort Gibraltar * 1816 Fort Gibraltar is captured and destroyed by the Red River Colony * 1817 Fort Gibraltar is rebuilt by the North West Company * 1821 The North West Company merges with Hudson's Bay Company ‚Äì Fort Gibraltar continues its operations under the Hudson's Bay Company standard * 1822 Fort Gibraltar is renamed Fort Garry * 1835 Fort Garry is rebuilt after being destroyed by the 1826 floodA Short Pictorial History On Upper Ft.

It is known variously as the red swamp crayfish, Louisiana crawfish, or mudbug. Appearance P. clarkii is typically dark red, with long claws and head, small or no spines on the sides of its carapace just below the head, and rows of bright red bumps on the front and side of the first leg. Range and range expansion The native range of P. clarkii is from northern Mexico and far southeastern New Mexico, through the Gulf States to the Florida Panhandle, as well as north through the Mississippi Basin to southern Illinois and Ohio. It has also been introduced, sometimes deliberately, outside its natural range to countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and elsewhere in the Americas. In northern Europe, the populations are self maintaining, but not expanding, while in southern Europe, P. clarkii is multiplying and actively colonising new territory, at the expense of the native crayfish, Astacus astacus and Austropotamobius spp. Individuals are reported to be able to cross many miles of relatively dry ground, especially in wet seasons, although the aquarium trade and anglers may have hastened the spread in some areas ( anglers using P. clarkii as bait are thought to have introduced it to the American state of Washington). Attempts have also been made to use P. clarkii as a biological control organism, to reduce levels of the snails involved in the lifecycle of schistosomiasis, leading to the dispersal of P. clarkii in, for instance, Kenya. Ecology P. clarkii, dorsal view P. clarkii is most commonly found in warm fresh water, such as slowly flowing rivers, marshes, reservoirs, irrigation systems and rice paddies. It is considered to be the most ecologically plastic species in the order Decapoda, and is able to grow quickly even in only seasonally present water, being able to tolerate dry spells of up to four months. P. clarkii grows quickly, and is capable of reaching weights in excess of , and sizes of long. It is also able to tolerate slightly saline water, which is unusual for a crayfish. Additionally, P. clarkii are physiologically capable of tolerating relatively low dissolved oxygen concentrations. The average lifetime of Procambarus clarkii is five years. Some individuals are known to have reached ages (in nature) of over six years. The burrowing activities of P. clarkii can lead to damage to water courses and to crops, particularly rice, and its feeding can disrupt native ecosystems. It may out-compete the native crayfish species, and is a vector for the crayfish plague fungus Aphanomyces astaci, for crayfish virus vibriosis, and a number of worms parasitic on vertebrates. Their burrowing activities may also be a threat to civil infrastructure such as storm ponds and levees. Economic importance Harvests of P. clarkii account for a large majority of the crayfish produced in the United States and elsewhere. Crayfish farming began in Louisiana in the 18th century, taking place in rice fields in a concurrent or alternate culture system. The concurrent culture of rice and crayfish makes good use of land, resources, equipment, and infrastructure already being used for rice production. However, crawfish production has decreased in recent years due to an increase of imports from China, which is now the world's leading producer of crawfish and is also using a rice-based system. A number of species of crustaceans were introduced to China to create markets for aquaculture and because they are better adapted to growing in a rice field than native fish species. Rice-fish farming originated in China and is once again growing as the yields from Green Revolution practices used to grow rice are no longer increasing, and resources such as land and water are becoming more limited. P. clarkii has also been introduced elsewhere for cultivation, such as Spain, where its success is attributable to its ability to colonise disturbed habitats that would be unsuitable for the native crayfish (Astacus astacus). P. clarkii is also marketed by biological supply companies for teaching and research. P. clarkii also exhibits different color morphs, including white, blue, and orange, which are commonly sold in pet stores. The introduction of P. clarkii has also resulted in economic losses in some regions. In the Baixo Mondego region of Portugal, it caused a decrease in 6.3% of profits in rice fields. However, this was on a wet-seeded field. All negative effects of crawfish can be avoided if adult crawfish are separated from the seed and seedlings. =As food= Boiled crawfish, Louisiana P. clarkii is eaten in the United States, Cambodia, Europe, China, Africa, Australia, Thailand, Canada, New Zealand, and the Caribbean. About 98% of the crayfish harvested in the United States come from Louisiana, where the standard culinary term is \\"crawfish\\" or \\"crawdaddy\\". Louisiana in 1990 produced 90% of the crawfish in the world and consumed 70% locally. Louisiana crawfish are usually boiled in a large pot with heavy seasoning (salt, cayenne pepper, lemon, garlic, bay leaves, etc.) and other items such as potatoes and corn on the cob. Many differing methods are used to season the dish, and there are an equal number of opinions on which one is correct.How to Season a Crawfish Boil They are generally served at a gathering known as a crawfish boil. Reproduction Procambarus clarkii normally reproduces sexually, but research suggests it may also reproduce by parthenogenesis. Can reproduce throughout the year References Further reading * External links Procambarus clarkii at Animal Diversity Web Cambaridae Freshwater crustaceans of North America Fauna of the Southeastern United States Crustaceans described in 1852 ","title":"Procambarus clarkii"},{"id":"3517848","text":"The Pennsylvania State University Marching Blue Band, known generally as the Blue Band, is the marching band of The Pennsylvania State University. Founded in 1899, it is the largest recognized student organization at the University Park campus of Penn State, presently with over 300 active student members. The primary function of the Blue Band is in support of the Penn State Nittany Lions football team, performing for all home football games at Beaver Stadium. Instrumentation The current Blue Band numbers 313 members, including 265 instrumentalists, 32 Blue Band Silks (Colorguard), 10 Touch of Blue (majorettes), 2 Uniform Managers, 2 Student Operations Assistants, a drum major and a Blue Sapphire (featured baton twirler). Members come from virtually all curricula and colleges represented at the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University. The 2019‚Äì2020 Penn State Marching Blue Band includes: * Total membership: 316 members * 1 Drum major (Jack Frisbie) * 14 Piccolos * 24 Clarinets * 26 Saxophones * 65 Trumpets * 26 Mellophones * 34 Trombones (4 bass trombones) * 14 Baritones * 30 Sousaphones * 32 Percussion * 2 Uniform Managers * 2 Student Operations Assistants * 32 Silks * 10 Majorettes * 1 Feature twirler (Gillian Brooks) History The Blue Band traces its history to 1899 with the formation of a six-member drum and bugle corps initiated by student George H. Deike. A donation from steel magnate and Penn State College Board of Trustees member Andrew Carnegie made possible the formation of a brass band in the summer of 1901. By 1913, the organization was known as the College Band, and the first permanent director of bands, Wilfred O. \\"Tommy\\" Thompson, was appointed in 1914. In 1923, a few new blue uniforms were purchased towards replacement of the old brown military-style uniforms in use. Blue uniforms were issued on the basis of ability and rank. Photos from 1924 (not shown here) show a nucleus of blue-uniformed members in a block \\"S\\" formation surrounded by a large number of brown-uniformed band members. This select group of instrumentalists became known as the \\"Blue Band\\" and represented Penn State as the official traveling band. During succeeding eras in which Hummel (Hum) Fishburn (1939‚Äì1947), James W. Dunlop (1947‚Äì1975), Ned C. Deihl (1975‚Äì1996), Dr. O. Richard Bundy (1996‚Äì2015) served as directors, the name Penn State Blue Band was kept even though all members were uniformed in blue. Today, the director of the Marching Blue Band is Gregory Drane. Auditions The Blue Band is open to all students at the University Park Campus by competitive audition. The Blue Band accepts 290‚Äì315 student members annually. Veteran members (returnees) must re-audition for the band the following year if they wish to return. The audition process consists of two parts of a standard etude or solo played on the Tuesday (prospective rookies) or Wednesday (prospective returnees) before band camp. The student should pick a slow/lyrical section and a technical/virtuosic section that demonstrates his/her current playing level. The student must then sight read a piece selected by the staff member responsible for their respective section to demonstrate the student's ability to pick up pieces quickly, as there is limited time to prepare the band's repertoire during the season. Staff members score both prepared and sightread performances, which are then tallied and ranked to assist the staff and section leaders in making final cuts. The day after the playing audition, rookies are taught the Blue Band style of marching, during which time other members of the Blue Band staff, as well as section leaders make decisions for final cuts which happen that evening. Although the band consists of over 300 players, there are fewer positions in both the pregame and halftime performances. After all the available slots on the drill are filled, the remaining players (usually rookies) are assigned to double a spot on the field with another Blue Band member (usually another rookie). These \\"alternates\\" are required to learn all the music and drill just as a regular member. Within each alternate pair, each person is guaranteed one performance between the first two football games. Afterwards, the whole section competes for spots on the field by memorizing and \\"checking off\\" (playing a school song or chaser for a section leader (guide), without music) as many pieces as possible. If there is a tie or the entire section has all of their music checked off, there are challenges where a player may challenge any one person in the section for a position. A challenge consists of the playing of Lions '68 (Floating LIONS Music) while marching the \\"skill drill\\", which is a basic outline of what each player must do while floating the \\"LIONS\\" during pregame. Rehearsal Membership in the Blue Band requires a large time commitment. The band practices weekly on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:00 p.m. to 5:45 p.m., and on Tuesday from 7:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. The band performs at all home football games and must arrive for an additional Saturday morning rehearsal five hours before the scheduled kickoff. All practices take place at the O. Richard Bundy Blue Band Building (dedicated in October 2015), the home of the band as of Fall 2004, or on the practice field next to it. A few weeks into the football season, however, Intramural Sports occupy the field on Tuesdays, so the band rehearses on the turf fields next to Holuba Hall, just off of University Drive. Performances The Blue Band during a halftime performance in Beaver Stadium. The Blue Band performs many times throughout the school year, not only during football season. In addition to home football games, the entire band travels to one away game per season, and there is also a small 15-person pep band that travels to the other away games. The band learns a new halftime show for every home game to add a variety of music to the band's repertoire, as well as adding variety to halftime performances. Saturday performances start by marching over to the Bryce Jordan Center in parade formation to Parade Order. When the band reaches the Bryce Jordan Center, the band plays its Pregame and Halftime music at an event known as Tailgreat, a pre-game pep rally, including performances by the Penn State Cheerleaders and an appearance by the Nittany Lion. After Tailgreat, the band makes its way outside to line up in parade formation to march to the stadium. As is tradition, the band starts its march to Beaver Stadium by singing a rousing rendition of \\"The Nittany Lion\\". The band then proceeds to the stadium and prepares for the pregame performance. When the band is not playing in on the field, it is located within the student section, just behind the South end zone. While in the stands, the band plays a variety of stands tunes and fight songs, including the official fight song of Penn State: \\"Fight On, State\\". After the game, the band has a post-game performance on the field, which consists of the traditional playing of \\"Lion Special\\", followed by select tunes from their half time performance. There is also a separate performance after the game on the northwest corner of the field known as the \\"Corner Concert\\", where the percussion section highlights their parts for halftime, Parade Order, and, more often than not, something entertaining they have come up with during the week. The band also has many other performances during the year including Men's and Women's Basketball and Volleyball games, and other various sporting events, such as Cross Country meets. Outside of the Blue Band's obligations as a pep band, the band has its own concert, traditionally known as \\"Band-o-rama\\", during which the band will reprise the year's halftime music and fight songs. Class Although the Blue Band itself is jointly administered by the College of Arts and Architecture and Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics, student members are not paid nor given any scholarship money by the university for being a member of the band. All students who participate in the Blue Band are enrolled in a one-credit class ‚Äì MUSIC 081 ‚Äì and must remain a student in good standing with the University in order to maintain their eligibility with the band.

According to his staff profile at blueband.psu.edu, Drane has served as the Assistant Director [of the Blue Band] since 2005, directing Athletic Pep Bands as well as founding the Penn State Volleyball Band, and has been part of the Blue Band staff since 2002, when he was a graduate assistant. A talented saxophone player himself, Drane has designed and arranged some of the band's most memorable halftime performances, including \\"Moving Picture Show\\" and \\"Game of THONS.\\" Drane holds a bachelor's degree in music education and music performance from Bethune‚ÄìCookman, a master's degree in music education from Penn State and is nearing completion on his Ph.D. from Penn State. =Staff= L-R: Eric W. Bush, Dennis Glocke, O. Richard Bundy, Gregory Drane, Carter Biggers, and Darrin Thornton Working with Mr. Drane are two assistant directors, numerous graduate teaching assistants, and instructors. Each assistant director holds a full-time faculty appointment within the Penn State School of Music, while the graduate teaching assistants and instructors vary between paid and volunteer positions. While utilizing many custom musical arrangements, drill for the Blue Band is typically written by the director and assistant directors, and each section of the band is assigned a graduate assistant or instructor to assist with instruction. The Assistant Directors of Bands at Penn State University are Robert Hickey and Erik Jester. According to their staff profiles on blueband.psu.edu: Robert Hickey serves as the Assistant Director of Athletic Bands. In addition to serving as an Assistant Director of the Blue Band, Mr. Hickey also conducts and directs the Fall Athletic Band and Pride of the Lions Band in the Spring. Mr. Hickey is an alum of Penn State and the Blue Band with a bachelor's degree in Music Education, and a master's degree in Conducting. Erik Jester joined the Penn State faculty in 2018 and serves as the Assistant Director of Athletic Bands. Additionally, Mr. Jester teaches undergraduate conducting courses and conducts the Concert Band. Prior to his appointment at Penn State, he was the Director of Bands and Instructor of Low Brass at California State University San Bernardino, preceded by positions at Madison College in Wisconsin and Triton College in Chicago. Mr. Jester holds master's degrees in trombone performance and conducting from Penn State and has completed doctoral coursework at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The current graduate teaching assistants for the Blue Band are Michquelena Potlunas Ferguson, William Oliver, Herb Payung and Chadijah Craig (2019 season). = Director Emeritus = O. Richard Bundy, Director of Athletic Bands Emeritus at Penn State From 1996 to 2015, the Blue Band was under the direction of O. Richard Bundy. Dr. Bundy received his undergraduate degree in music education from Penn State, then after receiving a master's degree from the University of Michigan, he returned to Penn State for his doctoral degree (serving as assistant director under Dr. Ned C. Deihl from 1983‚Äì1996). Prior to his appointment to the faculty, he served as trombonist with the United States Continental Army Band and as band director/instrumental music instructor in the Iroquois School District, Erie, Pennsylvania. In addition to conductor of the Blue Band, he teaches courses in conducting, marching band techniques, instrumental music education, and band literature. Dr. Bundy has the distinction of being the first director of the Blue Band that had previously marched in the band as a member, graduate or undergraduate. An active guest conductor and adjudicator, Bundy has conducted ensembles and presented clinics throughout the eastern United States and Canada. He is a member of the College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA), Music Educators National Conference, Pennsylvania Music Educators Association, Phi Beta Mu, and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. He is a past president of the Eastern Division of CBDNA and Phi Beta Mu, Nu chapter. On October 11, 2015, the Blue Band's practice facility was dedicated in Bundy's honor and renamed the O. Richard Bundy Blue Band Building. =Officers= The Blue Band is maintained in a large part by student officers who are elected by the band at the end of the season for the next season. Officers control uniform assignment, the band finances, the music library, equipment set up and transfer, as well as maintaining the band's website. Officers also organize intramural sports, ticket raffles, and getting vital information to the section through list serve. =Drum Major= The Penn State Blue Band has one drum major who is chosen in the spring prior to each band camp. The drum major leads the band through warm-ups and fundamentals as well as instructing the band during rehearsals. Along with duties in Band Camp and during Football season, the Drum Major also makes various appearances at The Student Bookstore or at other events to get the community a chance to see him/her. The Penn State Drum Major is perhaps best known for the pre-game flip that was created by Drum Major/gymnast Edwin L. Anderson for the 1942 season. Unfortunately, Anderson had to leave school for the Fall semester due to appendicitis, so the Flip didn't become a tradition until 1971. Currently, the Flip occurs twice under the current Blue Band pre-game drill. Blue Band Drum Majors have been 'flipping' for Penn State since 1971. In 1978, the flip evolved from a back flip to the current forward flip. The number of drum major flips in the Blue Band pre-game has varied from 1 to 3 (with the current number being 2). The drum major for the 2019 season was Jack Frisbie. The drum major for the 2020 season is Keith Griffith. =Guides= The Blue Band's most experienced and most talented members in each section are the guides (section leaders). Guides help the section, especially rookies, learn the Penn State way of doing anything from marching to playing to specifics about each section such as how to hold your instrument. =Squad leaders= The Band is divided up into about 60 squads, each with a squad leader. During halftime preparation, the squad leader is responsible for obtaining a copy of the halftime drill and teaching the other members of the squad how to read it, as well as assigning positions in the squad and coaching the squad during practices. Squad leaders are usually guides but in the lack of enough, especially in larger sections, the most experienced member of a squad is the squad leader. Gameday traditions = Team Walk and President's Tailgate = Since 2014, the football team arrives outside the baseball stadium, and is led by a parade consisting of a Blue Band pep band, the cheerleaders, dance team and the Nittany Lion, who walk up Curtin Road and then turn into the Stadium amidst the fans who line up along the route. Another pep band busses out to the Penn State Hotel and Conference Center to play at the President's Tailgate. The Band usually plays a few school songs to rally all those at the President's Tailgate. =Parade order= During the parade to the Bryce Jordan Center for Tailgreat, the parade from the center to Beaver Stadium, and the post-game parade from the stadium back to the Blue Band Building, the band marches to the percussion cadence, Parade Order. Each section of the band has their own set of chants and carefully choreographed motions. At one point, the trombone section performs \\"suicides\\" where the players alternate the positions of their horn between straight up and to the side, trumpets all hold their horns in a line parallel to the ground and do a wave, and the sousaphones do the \\"tail\\" in which the back of the band sousas essentially serpentine around each other, giving the band the appearance that it has a lions tail. There are also full band motions such as during the beginning of the parade where the whole band jumps and high kicks with their right foot. The full band also performs cheers such as \\"WE ARE PENN STATE!\\", and \\"I wish I was in the land of roses\\" to symbolize any Big Ten band's wish to make it to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Parade Order is the feature of the drumline's post-game performance, known as \\"Corner\\" or \\"Drumline Corner\\", which used to occur in the northwest corner of the stadium, but in recent years is performed on the 50-yard line, after the Blue Band's post-game performance. Each year, Parade Order is usually modified by one of the members of the drumline, and each week during \\"Corner\\" the break features an extended sketch rehearsed by the entire line (previously, a \\"vocal\\" featuring a humorous phrase or pop culture reference appeared at this spot). Other features of this performance include calling out the bass line (\\"Here comes the bass!\\"), 10 push-ups by the cymbal line, the \\"White DJ\\" visual by the snare line and circles by the tenor line. Parade Order is easily recognized due to its introduction, which features a lick that is similar to the beginning of the SCV cadence, \\"Electric Wheelchair.\\" =High-step Marching= The Blue Band performs their variation of the \\"Big Ten March style\\" during every gameday performance. In order to high-step march, Blue Band marchers must raise their thigh to be parallel with, extend their calf to be perpendicular to, and point the toe directly at the ground. This style, in contrast to typical drum-corps style marching, gives the band a very visual effect. Because the band performs this high-step, it enables them to perform certain moves that could not be done by low stepping. Penn State's signature pregame move ‚Äì the 3/4 turn ‚Äì orients the band to their right after performing a rapid 270-degree turn to the left. =Pregame= The band begins their pregame performance with \\"Lion Fanfare and Downfield\\". \\"Downfield\\" is when the Drum Major will perform the 2 trademark flips, one on the 50-yard line, and one on the South goal line. Next, the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" is played, followed by the playing of the opponent's fight song when the game is against a Big Ten team. \\"NFOS\\" is then played, during which the band creates the \\"PSU\\" formation. From the PSU formation, the \\"PSU Alma Mater\\" is played, and the band performs one verse towards each side of the stadium. The Band finishes up their pregame performance with the Blue Band's \\"trademark drill,\\" the Floating Lions. The band spells out the word \\"LIONS\\" across the field and reverses the drill halfway through, giving the word \\"LIONS\\" a full 180-degree rotation. Lastly, the band moves to the \\"Team Aisle\\" formation, from which the Penn State Nittany Lions football team will run out of the tunnel. There are no right turns in pregame. =Big Ten Salute= Every marching band that plays for a Big Ten Conference football team salutes the opposing team's fans during pregame with their fight song. The Penn State Blue Band inserts the opposing team's fight song into the middle of the pregame performance, and forms the first letter of the name of the opposing team's school while playing their song towards their fans. This happens immediately after the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" (at a home game) or \\"Lion Fanfare and Downfield\\" (at an away game). In both cases, this is directly before \\"NFOS\\" and the PSU formation. Facts & figures The Penn State Marching Blue Band has appeared at 33 bowl games including multiple appearances in the Orange, Cotton, Sugar, Fiesta, Gator (now TaxSlayer), Rose and Citrus Bowls. The band has also performed at the Outback, Blockbuster, Holiday, Pinstripe, and Rose Bowls and for the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football. In addition to marching in several Orange Bowl, Citrus Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl parades, the Blue Band marched in the Bicentennial Constitution Celebration Parade held in Philadelphia in 1987 and made its first appearance on January 2, 1995, in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. The Blue Band made its film debut in the 1977 made-for-TV movie Something for Joey. Appearing again in the 1993 feature film Rudy, they played \\"The Nittany Lion\\" in the movie. In 2005, the Penn State Blue Band was honored with the Sudler Trophy. The Trophy, which has been presented by the John Philip Sousa Foundation since 1982, is regarded as the nation's highest accolade for collegiate bands. Bundy joined previous Blue Band directors and representatives from the Penn State College of Arts and Architecture to accept the award at a halftime presentation during the 2005 homecoming game. In recognition of the honor, members of the Blue Band wore patches commemorating the achievement on their uniforms during the 2005 season.

It has by far the longest orbital period of the numbered periodic comets. On February 1, 2002, Chinese astronomer Zhang Daqing from Kaifeng discovered a new comet in the constellation Cetus, and reported it to the IAU.

According to tradition, since they discovered the new comet independently, the comet was named after both of them. The comet was initially designated as C/2002 C1 (Ikeya-Zhang). The comet was probably observed in 1661, 341 years earlier, by Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius. A bright comet had also been recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1661. The permanent designation \\"153P\\" was given to the comet. It has the longest known orbital period of any periodic comet (366.51 years).

Wolfowitz Doctrine is an unofficial name given to the initial version of the Defense Planning Guidance for the 1994‚Äì99 fiscal years (dated February 18, 1992) published by US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz and his deputy Scooter Libby. Not intended for public release, it was leaked to the New York Times on March 7, 1992,. and sparked a public controversy about U.S. foreign and defense policy. The document was widely criticized as imperialist, as the document outlined a policy of unilateralism and pre-emptive military action to suppress potential threats from other nations and prevent dictatorships from rising to superpower status. Such was the outcry that the document was hastily re-written under the close supervision of U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell before being officially released on April 16, 1992. Many of its tenets re-emerged in the Bush Doctrine,: \\"Preemption [‚Ä¶] requires hegemony. Although Bush speaks, in his letter of transmittal, of creating 'a balance of power that favors human freedom' while forsaking 'unilateral advantage,' the body of the NSS makes it clear that 'our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States.' The West Point speech put it more bluntly: 'America has, and intends to keep, military strengths beyond challenge.' The president has at last approved, therefore, Paul Wolfowitz's controversial recommendation to this effect, made in a 1992 'Defense Planning Guidance' draft subsequently leaked to the press and then disavowed by the first Bush administration. It's no accident that Wolfowitz, as deputy secretary of defense, has been at the center of the new Bush administration's strategic planning.\\" which was described by Senator Edward M. Kennedy as \\"a call for 21st century American imperialism that no other nation can or should accept.\\". Although Wolfowitz was ultimately responsible for the Defense Planning Guidance, as it was released through his office and was reflective of his overall outlook, he did not participate in its drafting, nor saw it before it was publicly released. The task of preparing the document fell to Libby, who delegated the process of writing the new strategy to Zalmay Khalilzad, a member of Libby's staff and longtime aide to Wolfowitz. In the initial phase of drafting the document, Khalilzad solicited the opinions of a wide cross-section of Pentagon insiders and outsiders, including Andrew Marshall, Richard Perle, and Wolfowitz's University of Chicago mentor, the nuclear strategist Albert Wohlstetter.Mann 2004, p. 210. Completing the draft in March 1992, Khalilzad requested permission from Libby to circulate it to other officials within the Pentagon. Libby assented and within three days Khalilzad's draft was released to the New York Times by \\"an official who believed this post-cold war strategy debate should be carried out in the public domain.\\" Mann 2004, p. 210  Doctrine articles  = Superpower status = The doctrine announces the U.S.'s status as the world‚Äôs only remaining superpower following the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War and proclaims its main objective to be retaining that status. This was substantially re-written in the April 16 release. = U.S. primacy = The doctrine establishes the U.S.'s leadership role within the new world order. This was substantially re-written in the April 16 release. = Unilateralism = The doctrine downplays the value of international coalitions. This was re-written with a change in emphasis in the April 16 release. = Preventive Intervention = The doctrine stated the U.S‚Äôs right to intervene when and where it believed necessary. This was softened slightly in the April 16 release. = Russian threat = The doctrine highlighted the possible threat posed by a resurgent Russia. This was removed from the April 16 release in favour of a more diplomatic approach. = Middle East and Southwest Asia = The doctrine clarified the overall objectives in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. The April 16 release was more circumspect and it reaffirmed U.S. commitments to Israel as well as its Arab allies.

He was described by the art commentator Thalasso as a painter through whom the East spoke. The eldest child of a large family, de Mango was born in the town of Bisceglie near Bari in Italy, where he honed his native talent for drawing up to the age of nineteen.Centro di Studi Biscegliese, short biography. On the Golden Horn by de Mango. Biography In 1862, under the patronage of an aristocratic family of Bari, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples and studied there for eight years under Filippo Palizzi and Domenico Morelli. Morelli was a painter who treated exotic orientalist themes. During this period de Mango also worked with Saverio Altamura, Bernardo Celentano, Raffaele d'Auria, Federico Maldarelli, Raffaele Postiglione and Giuseppe Mancinelli. In 1883 De Mango settled in Istanbul during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, where he is known to have set up, and taught for some time at, the oil painting department of the School of Fine Arts. Forced to leave Istanbul briefly in 1911 during the Tripolitanian War, the artist returned to the city following the Treaty of Ouchy on 15 October 1912. De Mango was among the artists who, at the initiative of Alexander Vallaury, a teacher in the architecture department of the School of Fine Arts, and Regis Delbeuf, manager of the Istanbul daily Le Stamboul, organized the first painting and sculpture exhibition at Beyoƒülu in 1901, dubbed the Pera Exhibitions in the Passage Oriental, an arcade owned by the French merchant Bourdon. With 27 works, De Mango was the most well- represented artist in the exhibition, as he was again in the 1920 exhibition when he was one of 36 artists, participating with 33 of his own paintings. De Mango also had 16 paintings in the last of the Pera exhibitions, which was held in 1903. He painted in the open air and in his workshop at Beyoƒülu, reflecting the daily life of the different districts of Istanbul until his death in 1930. Istanbul dreamscapes De Mango conjured up idyllic scenes in the paintings he made at Fenerbah√ße and √úsk√ºdar on Istanbul's undulating coastline. The sparkling surface and unruffled calm of the sea and the trees along the shore enhance the dream-like atmosphere. Besides these scenes on the Marmara, the artist also depicted a large number of other spots in Istanbul including B√ºy√ºkdere, G√∂ksu (the Sweet Waters of Asia), the old Muslim quarter of Ey√ºp, the Greek district of Phanar, the Princes‚Äô Islands, the Golden Horn, Seraglio Point and the Bosphorus. Despite his powerful use, especially, of color in his oil paintings, problems of perspective are nonetheless observable here and there. A prolific artist, De Mango worked extensively in oil, watercolor, pencil and India ink. Not only did he continuously treat new subjects, he is also known, upon popular demand, to have reworked at his Beyoƒülu atelier some of his earlier studies of Damascus, Beirut and Egypt from sketches at hand, selling most of them to his Levantine clients. With the proclamation of the Republic on 29 October 1923 and the transfer of the seat of government to Ankara, artistic activities in Istanbul began to lose momentum as development focused on the new capital. During this formative period in the Turkish art of painting and its milieu, the artist was, therefore, far-removed from the new developments. Owing to advancing age, his activities were restricted to giving lessons in the mansions of the cosmopolitan circle in which he lived and moved, and holding one-man shows at the Italian-run ‚ÄòSocieta Operaia‚Äô and ‚ÄòCasa d‚ÄôItalia‚Äô. He also made large- scale paintings of the saints commissioned by the city's several Italian churches. de Mango at Dolmabah√ße Palace Leading a solitary existence, De Mango was a man of supreme dignity and nobility and of a proud, stern nature. Through a regular correspondence with his brother Carlo de Mango back in Italy, he maintained close ties with his family and the city of his birth. In financial straits during the final years of the near half-century he spent in Istanbul, De Mango lived in a single room allocated to him by Marcello Campaner in the ‚ÄòPalazzetto dei Dragomani‚Äô (Translators‚Äô House) behind the Casa d‚ÄôItalia. De Mango, who died at the age of eighty-eight, never married and nursed a perpetual longing for a family. Leonardo de Mango, is thought to have made some 1500 drawings and paintings, both oils and water colors, during his 47-year sojourn in Istanbul.

Biography =Early political life= Vatinius was quaestor in 63 BC, the same year Marcus Tullius Cicero was consul. Cicero believed that Vatinius was elected on account of the influence of another of the consuls. Cicero sent him to Puteoli to prevent the gold and silver from being carried away from the city, but his extortions were so oppressive that the inhabitants were obliged to complain of his conduct to Cicero. He later served as a legatus under Gaius Cosconius. Again Cicero claims that while there he carried out robbery and extortion.Cicero, Vatin., passim. =In the service of Caesar= In 59 BC he was tribune of the plebs and allied himself to Gaius Julius Caesar, who was then consul along with Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. Vatinius was a most zealous partisan for Caesar. He brought forward several proposals before the assemblies of the people, including the lex Vatinia, which granted Caesar Cisalpine Gaul and IIlyricum for five years, to which the senate‚Äîat the instigation of Pompey and Piso‚Äîafterwards added the province of Transalpine Gaul. Cicero accuses him of setting the auspices at defiance, of offering violence to the consul Bibulus, of filling the forum with soldiers, and of crushing the veto of his colleagues in the tribunate by force of arms. It was during his tribunate that Vatinius brought forward the informer Lucius Vettius, who accused many of the most distinguished men in the state, and among others Cicero, of a plot against the life of Pompey.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, ii.24; pro Sestio 63 Vatinius left Rome with Caesar to serve as a legate in Gaul.Julius Caesar, de Bello Gallico, viii.46. But soon he returned to Rome to run for further political offices; but he failed in standing for the praetorship. His animosity towards Cicero continued and he appeared as a witness against Milo and Sestius, two of Cicero's friends. Cicero spoke on behalf of Sestius with a scathing speech against the character of Vatinius.Cicero, pro Sestio, passim; ad Quintem fratrem ii.4. =Praetorship= After a fair amount of turmoil, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus were elected to the consulship for 55 BC. Marcus Porcius Cato was put forward by the optimates for the praetorship. Pompeius and Crassus successfully defeated Cato, securing the election for Vatinius.Plutarch, Cato minor, 42; Pompey, 52. After his year in office, Vatinius was accused of bribery by Licinius Calvus. Calvus had previously accused Vatinius, but this was his most eloquent speech. Vatinius even interrupted him to exclaim, \\"I ask you, judges, if I am to be condemned because the accuser is eloquent.\\"Seneca the Elder, Controversiae, 7.4.6. Cicero, despite his previous attacks against Vatinius, defended him because he was afraid of offending the triumvirs and wanted their protection from Publius Clodius.Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, i.9. Despite Cicero's speech, Vatinius' acquittal was more likely due to bribery by his patrons. =Service during the civil wars= Vatinius returned to Gaul in 51 BC where he was again a legatus for Julius Caesar. He stayed with Caesar during the start of the civil war.Julius Caesar, de Bello Civili, iii.19. While in Greece, Caesar sent him with peace proposals to Pompeius. But instead of serving at the battle of Pharsalus, he defended Brundisium from Decimus Laelius, who led an attack on the city with part of Pompeius's fleet.Julius Caesar, de Bello Civili, iii.100. In return for his success, Vatinius was rewarded with the consulship in 47 BC. In 46 BC he was sent to Illyricum with three legions and defeated Marcus Octavius, a Pompeian partisan with a large fleet, for which he received an ovatio.Appian, Illyrian Wars, 13. As Vatinius's troops had declared in favor of Marcus Junius Brutus, he was forced to turn over command of his army to the latter in 44 BCE, after the death of Caesar, when Brutus went to Macedonia to take command of his province.Dio Cassius, Roman History, xlvii.21; Livy, Periochae, 118; Appian, The Civil Wars, iv.75. In 42 BC he was permitted to ride in triumph for services in Illyricum. In later life, he reconciled with Cicero. Personal life Vatinius was married twice, first to Antonia Cretica (sister of Mark Antony) and later to a woman named Pompeia. It has been suggested that this woman could have been a sister of Pompeyhttps://web.archive.org/web/20200504150020/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/53182963.pdf or Julius Caesar's ex-wife Pompeia.

He was a member of the distinguished Claudia gens. He was a friend to Roman senator Cicero and an early opponent of Julius Caesar. He was also noteworthy for marrying the sister of the future emperor Augustus, Octavia the Younger, with whom he fathered M. Marcellus, who was for a while Augustus' intended heir. Biography =Early life= He was a direct descendant of consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus. His grandfather was also named Marcus; his father was Gaius and his mother was named Junia. =Family= From his first unnamed wife, Marcellus had a daughter who married the Roman senator Sextus Quinctilius Varus, who served as a Quaestor in 49 BC. He was a grandfather to the Roman general Publius Quinctilius Varus and his three sisters. He later married Octavia the Younger, a great-niece of Julius Caesar, sister of Octavian, and a child of the Roman consul Gaius Octavius, in an arranged ceremony. Octavia bore Marcellus three known surviving children: a son, Marcus, and two daughters, both named Claudia Marcella, born in Rome.

However, Pompey apparently declined the proposal and Octavia's husband continued to oppose Julius Caesar, culminating in the crucial year of his consulship in 50 BC when he tried to recall Julius Caesar from his ten-year governorship in Gaul two years early, without his army, in an attempt to save the Roman Republic. Failing this, he called unsuccessfully upon Caesar to resign. He also obstructed Caesar from standing for a second consulship in absentia, insisting that he should return to Rome to stand, thereby forgoing the protection of his armies in Gaul. When Caesar finally invaded Italy in 49 BC, Marcellus, unlike his brother and nephew, did not take up arms against him. Caesar subsequently pardoned him. =Later years= In 46 BC, with the help of other senators including Cicero (in the latter's Pro Marcello), Gaius was able to intercede with Caesar for his cousin M. Claudius Marcellus, a former consul of 51 BC and a fervent anti- Caesarian, who was at the time living in exile in Mytilene. Gaius died in May 40 BC; five months later, his widow, Octavia, married the triumvir Mark Antony.

Auth is best known for his syndicated work originally drawn for The Philadelphia Inquirer, for whom he worked from 1971 to 2012. Auth's art won the cartoonist the Pulitzer Prize in 1976 and the Herblock Prize in 2005. Biography =Early years= William Anthony \\"Tony\\" Auth, Jr. was born May 7, 1942 in Akron, Ohio, the son of William Anthony Auth, Sr. and Julia Kathleen Donnelly. At age five Auth was bedridden with rheumatic fever for a number of months.William Yardley, \\"Tony Auth, Pulitzer-Winning Cartoonist, Dies at 72,\\" New York Times, Sept. 15, 2014. During this period of protracted convalescence, Auth was encouraged by his mother to take up drawing as an enjoyable and worthy creative pastime. Inspired by comic book art, Auth began to draw regularly, making use of an ample supply of paper, pencils, and crayons provided by his parents. At age nine, he and his family moved to Los Angeles, California where Auth continued his education. Auth attended UCLA where he earned his bachelor's degree in biological illustration in 1965.Michael Cavna, \\"RIP, Tony Auth: Colleagues Salute Pulitzer-Winning Philadelphia Journalist as a Singular, Big-Hearted Artist,\\" Washington Post, Sept. 15, 2014. At UCLA he also worked on the Daily Bruin, the school newspaper, as well as for various alternative newspapers in the Los Angeles area. Auth was married to Eliza Drake Auth, who is a realist landscape and portrait painter. Together they had two children. The couple resided in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. =Career= After Auth graduated he became a medical illustrator at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital, a large teaching hospital associated with the University of Southern California. During his time as a medical illustrator, Auth began drawing political cartoons. Auth started out doing one political cartoon a week for a weekly alternative newspaper. He eventually worked his way up to drawing three political cartoons a week for the UCLA Daily Bruin. In 1971, Auth was hired on as staff editorial cartoonist by The Philadelphia Inquirer. He would work for this same company for 41 years. Auth's work was published by the Inquirer five days a week, reaching an additional national audience via syndication. Although his personal politics leaned to the left, Auth used his work as an equal opportunity foil against political incompetence by politicians from both sides of the Congressional aisle. He was an outspoken critic of financial corruption on Wall Street, racial bigotry and intolerance, and gun violence, driving home his points with wit and a minimalistic artistic style. Auth made use of a light table in composing his finished work, in which he attempted to mimic the rough-hewn simplicity of rapidly drawn preliminary sketches.\\"Farewell, Tony Auth,\\" Association of American Editorial Cartoonists, Sept. 15, 2014. His content was acerbic and made use of irony in hammering home his political points. In 1976 Auth's work was rewarded with a Pulitzer Prize. He would be a finalist for the Pulitzer two more times during his four decade career, finishing on that short list in 1983 and 2010. Auth also won the prestigious Herblock Prize in 2005, an award given by a foundation established by the late political cartoonist Herb Block. Auth retired from his position at the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2012, taking a buyout from the paper. Following his departure from the paper, Auth went to work for the online news producer NewsWorks.org, owned by Philadelphia news-talk radio station WHYY-FM, where he became the publication's first digital artist-in-residence. His other work includes the comic strip Full Disclosure, which he drew from 1982 to 1983, and Norb, which he produced in 1989. In addition to his ongoing daily newspaper work Auth published several collections of his political cartoons and illustrated eleven children's books. =Death= Tony Auth died of brain cancer on September 14, 2014. He was 72 years old. Awards Auth received many awards over his career which included: * five Overseas Press Club Awards * Sigma Delta Chi Award for distinguished service in journalism * Thomas Nast Prize * Herblock Prize (2005) * Pulitzer Prize (1976) Auth was also awarded an honorary doctorate in 2012 by the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.

Its oversized circular bar was a New York landmark.Toots Shor Preview It was frequented by celebrities, and together with the 21 Club, the Stork Club, Delmonico's and El Morocco was one of the places to see and be seen. Joe DiMaggio often went there to eat, and that helped make it famous. Toots was said to do personal favors for Joe as well, at no cost.The American Experience: Joe DiMaggio/Toots Shor Jackie Gleason always ate there for free. Other notable guests included Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Orson Welles, Yogi Berra, and Ernest Hemingway (Berra and Hemingway allegedly met there). History While the food at Toots Shor's Restaurant was known to be ‚Äúnuttin‚Äô fancy‚Äù ‚Äî standard American, sports-bar fare such as shrimp cocktail, steak, baked potato ‚Äî the establishment became well known for who frequented there and how Shor interacted with them. Shor was a raconteur and a master of the \\"needle,\\" jibes or quips directed at the famous. Celebrity alone was not enough to receive first-class service in Shor's restaurant. According to David Halberstam in his book The Summer of '49, guests had to observe the unwritten \\"code\\" which prevailed in Shor's establishment. Charlie Chaplin, who was not privy to that code, was made to wait in line. When Chaplin complained, Shor told him to entertain the others who were waiting in line. One day, MGM head Louis B. Mayer complained about waiting twenty minutes for a table and said, ‚ÄúI trust the food will be worth all that waiting.‚Äù Shor replied: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be better‚Äôn some of your crummy pictures I stood in line for.‚Äù In a famous incident, Shor outdrank Jackie Gleason and left him on the floor to prove the point. Somewhat notoriously, wives were not welcome in Toots‚Äôs saloon; it was known, in the argot of the day, as a place of \\"booze and broads,\\" where ballplayers, actors and politicians mixed. Baseball players were especially welcomed; in particular, Shor admired Mickey Mantle. He also adored Joe DiMaggio. Shor always ensured that DiMaggio got first-rate service without being hassled or asked for autographs by restaurant staff, other patrons, or fans. Another prominent figure who frequented Shor's restaurant was famed trial attorney Edward Bennett Williams. During his time as a private attorney while living in New York City in the mid-1960s, Richard Nixon liked to stop in on Saturday nights, usually to talk sports with the various athletes who were present. Toots Shor cultivated his celebrity following by giving them unqualified admiration, loyal friendship, and a kind of happy, boozy, old- fashioned male privacy. Those whom Shor really liked were called ‚Äúcrum-bums‚Äù. Shor reputedly said that he didn‚Äôt care if he was a millionaire‚Äîso long as he could live like one. Shor was rewarded after a fashion with a mention in the 1954 film White Christmas, in which Bing Crosby's character comments to Rosemary Clooney's, while both are raiding the restaurant refrigerator of the Vermont inn where they are staying, that the food is not as fancy as Toots Shor's. In 1959, Shor sold the lease for his 51st Street restaurant for $1.5 million to William Zeckendorf and Mutual Life and it closed on June 30, 1959. The following year he opened at a new location at 33 West 52nd Street, the former Leon & Eddie's, and tried to emulate the decor and atmosphere of the original. The then-Chief Justice Earl Warren considered Toots one of his closest friends, and \\"The Chief\\" showed up to be photographed with a shovel full of dirt when Toots broke ground on his 52nd street \\"joint.\\" Closing In 1971, authorities padlocked the doors of the 52nd Street restaurant for nonpayment of federal, state, and local taxes totaling $269,516. Shor vowed to open again in three weeks, but 18 months passed before his restaurant at 5 East 54th Street opened. For a variety of reasons, however, his famous clientele never returned with their former regularity. In 1977, the 52nd Street restaurant became a disco called \\"New York New York.\\" \\"Toots\\" Shor died indigent in 1977.

Claudius Marcellus ‚Äì was five times consul and fought against Hannibal in Italy. Nothing is known of his earlier life, any military service, or his quaestorship and entry to the Senate, although he may have been the candidate in opposition to Clodius for the curule aedileship of 56 BC of whom, on 23 November, Cicero wrote \\"The candidate Marcellus is snoring so loud that I can hear him next door\\" Cicero, ad Att. iv.3 (although the other two contemporary Claudii Marcelli are also possibilities). Marcellus must have held the praetorship at the latest in 52 BC,Sulla's legislation set the minimum age of 39 for praetors; for Marcellus to be consul in 49 BC this is the last year in which he could have held the praetorship but he could have held the office some years before ‚Äì there is no mention of this in the historical record. In 50 BC Marcellus was elected consul for the following yearMRR II s.a. 49BC (AUC 705) alongside Lentulus Crus, as opponents to Caesar.Caesar, B.G. 8.50 Both his brother Marcus and cousin Gaius (Minor) had strongly opposed Caesar during their own consulships,Caesar, B.G. 8.53; Plutarch, Caesar 29.1, 29.2; Plutarch, Pompeius 58.4, 58.6; Suetonius, Div.Iul. 28.2 , 28.3, 29.1 working to have his proconsulship of Gaul terminated and to prevent Caesar from standing for election as consul of 48 BC in absentia. Caesar had blocked Marcus by working with the tribunes and the other consul, Servius Sulpicius Rufus, and then Gaius (Minor) by heavily bribing his consular colleague, Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus,Plutarch, Pompeius 58.1; Plutarch, Caesar 29.3; Suetonius, Div.Iul. 29.1 but had not yet been able to secure election to a second consulship without having to stand as a candidate in Rome and without relinquishing his proconsular command (which would expose him to prosecutionSuetonius Div.Iul. 30.3 for illegalities in his first consulship). The election of Marcellus and Lentulus as consuls for 49 BC was within the normal framework of family connections and influences,Gruen, p.158 but also a snub to Caesar through his own candidate, Servius Sulpicius Galba.Caesar, B.G. 8.50 Gaius Marcellus and Lentulus Crus continued the policy of the Claudii Marcelli in their opposition to Caesar.Suetonius, Div.Iul. 29.2 ; Velleius, II.49, 3 Civil War Late in 50 BC, with much of the Senate wanting peace and unwilling to act against Caesar,Plutarch, Pompeius 58.5 the consul Gaius Marcellus (Minor) took matters into his own hands and led a coup, without the backing of the Senate and directed against Caesar, aiming to put control of an armyLegions were being assembled for a campaign against Parthia into the hands of Pompeius.Dio Cassius, XL.66; Plutarch, Pompeius 58.6 Lentulus, as consul- elect certainly joined with him in this,Plutarch, Pompeius 59.1 possibly Gaius Marcellus Major too.Meier p.342 Neither the Claudii Marcelli or Lentulus were particular adherents of Pompeius, a powerful magnate and general, but saw him as a tool to use against Caesar.Velleius, II.49, 2 On the Kalends 1 January 49 BC, Marcellus and Lentulus entered office, and were presented at once with letters from Caesar, the tenor of which was claimed to be a declaration of war: Caesar would stand his legions down provided Pompey did as well;Appian, II.32; Dio Cassius, XLI.1; Caesar, B.C. I.1 otherwise, he intended to retain them and \\"move quickly\\" to avenge the wrongs done against him‚Äîpresumably against Rome.Appian, II.32 The Senate's response was an ultimatum: Caesar was to disband his legions or be declared a public enemy.Dio Cassius, XLI.1; Caesar, B.C. I.2 After a week of angry exchanges, on 7 January 49 BC, the senate under Lentulus and Marcellus passed the \\"final decree\\" (senatus consultum ultimum);Caesar, B.C. i.5 the tribunes Antonius and Cassius fled with Caesar's envoy, the younger Gaius Scribonius Curio, from Rome to meet Caesar at Ravenna. Whilst Lentulus is recorded as the more vehement of the consuls in instigating the action that caused the tribunes to flee,Dio Cassius, XLI.3; Plutarch, Caesar 31.2 Marcellus does not seem to have been aloof.Appian, II.33 On 10 January, Caesar famously crossed the Rubicon,Suetonius, Div.Jul 31 , 32; Plutarch Pompeius 60.2 starting the Civil War. Initially Marcellus remained in Rome, with the consuls opposing any accommodation with Caesar,Appian, II.37 maintaining an anti-Caesarian hysteria, and pressuring Pompeius to cross Italy and raise troops.Appian, II.36 On 17 January both Marcellus and his colleague followed Pompeius in leaving Rome ahead of Caesar's advancing forces,Appian, II.37; Caesar, B.C. I.14; Dio Cassius, XLI.6 scandalously without even making the usual sacrifices before departure.Plutarch, Caesar 34.1; Plutarch Pompeius 61.4 They went south to Teanum where, on 22 January, Lucius Julius Caesar, a kinsman serving with Caesar, brought conciliatory proposals from the proconsul.Caesar, B.C. I.10; Cicero, ad Att. vii.13a, vii.14 On 25 January Cicero (whose letters provide the details of these events) met with Marcellus and Lentulus in Capua, along with many other senators who had fled Rome. Cicero reported to his correspondent, Atticus, that all were anxious that Caesar should stand by his offer and they had sent messages back to him.Cicero, ad Att. vii.15, vii.16 However, within a few days Cicero was reporting to Atticus that the consuls did not care for peace.Cicero, ad Att. vii.20 Lentulus was even reported to have tried to recruit gladiators at one stage, but thought better of this when criticized.Caesar, B.C. I.14 The whereabouts of Marcellus was not known, even by 7 February, when he was two days late for a meeting with Lentulus and Cicero. The latter despaired, writing in frustration that the consuls were of no use and that no recruiting was being done.Cicero, ad Att. vii.21 Pompeius himself wrote from Luceria on 17 February to Marcellus and Lentulus urging them to collect all the troops they could and join him at Brundisium.Cicero, ad Att. viii.12a By 20 February the consuls had done so.Suetonius, Div.Jul 34.1 ; Cicero, ad Att. viii.11c In late February Caesar sent his agent, Cornelius Balbus (the younger) on a secret mission to win over the consul Lentulus with the bribe of a lucrative province;Cicero, ad Att. viii.9, 11; ad Fam. x.32 there is no hint that he made any similar offers to Marcellus, which may be an indication of the latter's comparative honesty or, perhaps more likely, his comparative insignificance in Roman politics. Balbus was too late in any case: Pompeius had sent both consuls and their forces on ahead of him to DyrrhachiumAppian, II.39, 40; Caesar, B.C. I.25; Plutarch, Caesar 35.2; Plutarch Pompeius 62.2 and he followed with the remainder by 4 March, narrowly evading Caesar.Cicero, ad Att. ix.6 Cicero condemned this, as it destroyed the negotiations for peace which he claimed to be mediating.Cicero, ad Att. ix.9 Very little is known specifically about Marcellus after crossing to Dyrrachium, though he is addressed by the Goddess Discordia in Petronius' Satyricon, urged to hold fast to the decree which commanded Caesar to resign his proconsulship,Petronius, Satyricon, ch.124 v.288 the senatus consultum of 7 January 49 BC. Pompeius placed much emphasis on his fleets to prevent Caesar from crossing from Italy. One fleet, that from Rhodes, was jointly commanded by Marcellus in association with Gaius Coponius.Caesar, B.C. III.5 Other than this, nothing is known of Marcellus' involvement in the Civil War. The command of the Rhodian fleet at Dyrrachium was later mentioned as being under the command of Quintus CoponiusCaesar, B.C. III.26 and was wrecked in a storm.Caesar, B.C.

It was sparked by leaked images of Iraqi prisoners, hooded and naked, being mistreated obtained by the United States and global media in April 2004. The Fay Report was one of five such investigations ordered by the military and was the third to be submitted, as it was completed and released on August 25, 2004. Prior to the report's release, seven reservist military police had already been charged for their roles in the abuse at the prison, and so the report examined the role of military intelligence, specifically the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade that was responsible for the interrogation of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. General Paul J. Kern was the appointing authority for the report and oversaw the investigation. The chief investigators were Major General George Fay, whom the report is named after, and Lieutenant General Anthony R. Jones. The Fay Report noted that \\"contracting-related issues contributed to the problems at Abu Ghraib prison\\". General Fay also wrote that \\"The general policy of not contracting for intelligence functions and services was designed in part to avoid many of the problems that eventually developed at Abu Ghraib...\\". The report identified lack of contractor oversight as a cause of both the insufficient training that contractors received and inadequate contract management. While over half the interrogators at the prison were employees of Caci International, up to 35% lacked any formal military interrogation training. Questions have also been raised about whether CACI's background checks on prospective employees were adequate. In addition to questions about contractors qualifications, the report also notes that military personnel were ill-prepared for the tasks of contract administration, monitoring and oversight. The Fay Report implicated 27 members of the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade in the abuse, including four civilian contractors and an additional three military police to the seven previously charged. Eight members were also cited for not reporting the mistreatment. Colonel Thomas M. Pappas, who was commander and the top military intelligence officer at Abu Ghraib, along with four lower-ranking officers were subject to possible criminal charges as well as administrative action and another four officers ranking higher than colonel. The report \\"revealed disturbing facts\\" of the cited forty-four cases of abuse, with General Kern going as far to call some of these abuses torture. One example of such mistreatment cited in the report was a 'game' where guards and interrogators competed with dogs to see who could make naked teenage prisoners defecate out of fear first. In addition to the abuse, the report cited at least eight cases of ghost detainees, or inmates hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross and other human rights groups. General Kern acknowledged there could be more than a dozen cases, and other reports later confirmed there could have been more than 100, bringing forth media questions about the role of the CIA at the prison. The report concluded that higher-ranking officials such as Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the top US commander in Iraq, and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, as well as Pentagon and Justice Department officials were not culpable but bore responsibility for creating conditions that led to the abuse and recommended further investigation. These conditions included commanders being under-prepared for the mass influx of prisoners, poor leadership and discipline, unclear directives, and a lack of troops, and questioned how only lower-ranking personnel were solely responsible for some of the 'torture methods' carried out.

This major collection, consisting of 2.5 million clippings, tearsheets and comic sections, spanning the years 1894 to 1996, has provided source material for numerous books and articles by Blackbeard and other researchers.  Biography  Born in Lawrence, Indiana, Blackbeard spent his childhood in this rural town northeast of Indianapolis. His grandfather ran a service station; his father, Sydney Blackbeard, was an electrician, and his mother, Thelma, handled the bookkeeping for Sydney's business. When he was eight or nine, the family moved to Newport Beach, California, where he attended high school. During World War II, Blackbeard served with the 89th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squad, 9th Army, in France, Belgium and Germany. In the post-war years, he went to Fullerton College on the G.I. Bill, studying history, English and American literature. He also worked on the staff of the Torch, the college yearbook. Books The Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics Blackbeard vigorously defended comic strips as worthy of study. \\"The comic strip is the only wholly indigenous American art form. . . . Only the tasteless and uninformed consider comic art trivial.\\" He described comic books, by contrast, as \\"meretricious dreck,\\" which may have marginalized him in the broader field of comic art.Fox, Margalit. \\"Bill Blackbeard, Comic Strip Champion, Dies at 84\\".

(San Francisco, Associated Press) As a freelance writer, Blackbeard wrote, edited or contributed to more than 200 books on cartoons and comic strips, including 100 Years of Comic Strips, the Krazy & Ignatz series (Eclipse/Fantagraphics) and NBM's 18-volume Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy. His contributions to various magazines has been documented by illustrator John Adcock, who commented: In 1977, Blackbeard and the jazz critic Martin Williams collaborated on The Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics, regarded by the comics community as a major work in the field because it provides an authoritative overview of the 20th century's leading strips.Biography of the Collector: Bill Blackbeard San Francisco Academy of Comic Art Finding that libraries were discarding bound newspapers after microfilming, Blackbeard established the San Francisco Academy of Comic Art in 1968 as a non-profit organization and began collecting newspapers from California libraries, expanding his scope to institutions nationwide. Blackbeard and his wife Barbara, married in 1966, were forced out of several San Francisco addresses by the growth of Bill's collections. The Academy found its longest lasting home in a Spanish stucco home at 2850 Ulloa Street in San Francisco's quiet residential Sunset district.Schwartz, Marshall. \\"He Lives in a Funny House Full of Old Comic Strips,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, January 20, 1972. The scope of this collection was detailed by Jeet Heer: During three decades of acquisition, Blackbeard accumulated 75 tons of material, which filled both the upstairs rooms and the ground-floor garage. In 1997, he learned that the owner of the home was not going to renew his lease, necessitating a new location for the SFACA collection. Blackbeard then entered into negotiations with Lucy Shelton Caswell, curator of Ohio State University's Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum (then known as the Cartoon Research Library).Blackbeard, Bill. \\"The Four Color Paper Trail\\", International Journal of Comic Art , Fall 2003. In January 1998, six semi- trailer trucks moved the collection from California to Ohio. The Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum offered this description of Blackbeard's collection: Double Fold It was Blackbeard who told Nicholson Baker about \\"fraudulent\\" studies used by libraries to justify their massive destruction of books and newspapers, information documented by Baker in his book Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper (2001), a National Book Critics Circle Award Winner. Baker, who devoted the preface of that book to his discussions with Blackbeard, later commented: According to Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum curator Jenny E. Robb, Blackbeard left bound volumes intact in later years.  Later life and death  After he sold the collection to Ohio State in 1997, Blackbeard moved from San Francisco to Santa Cruz, California, where his wife liked to surf.Baker, Nicholson. Double Fold. Random House, 2001. He continued to contribute to books and indulge his interests, in addition to comic strips, in pulp magazines, old films and penny dreadfuls. At age 84, Blackbeard died on March 10, 2011, in Watsonville, California.

C-PTSD relates to the trauma model of mental disorders and is associated with chronic sexual, psychological, narcissistic (child) abuse and physical abuse or neglect, chronic intimate partner violence, victims of prolonged workplace or school bullying, victims of kidnapping and hostage situations, indentured servants, victims of slavery and human trafficking, sweatshop workers, prisoners of war, concentration camp survivors, residential school survivors, and defectors of cults or cult-like organizations. Situations involving captivity/entrapment (a situation lacking a viable escape route for the victim or a perception of such) can lead to C-PTSD-like symptoms, which can include prolonged feelings of terror, worthlessness, helplessness, and deformation of one's identity and sense of self. C-PTSD has also been referred to as DESNOS or Disorders of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified. Some researchers believe that C-PTSD is distinct from, but similar to, PTSD, somatization disorder, dissociative identity disorder, and borderline personality disorder. Its main distinctions are a distortion of the person's core identity and significant emotional dysregulation. It was first described in 1992 by an American psychiatrist and scholar, Judith Herman in her book Trauma & Recovery and in an accompanying article. The disorder is included in the World Health Organization's (WHO) eleventh revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The C-PTSD criteria has not yet gone through the private approval board of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) for inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Complex PTSD is also recognized by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Healthdirect Australia (HDA), and the National Health Service (NHS).  Symptoms  = Children and adolescents = The diagnosis of PTSD was originally developed for adults who had suffered from a single-event trauma, such as rape, or a traumatic experience during a war. However, the situation for many children is quite different. Children can suffer chronic trauma such as maltreatment, family violence, dysfunction, and or a disruption in attachment to their primary caregiver. In many cases, it is the child's caregiver who causes the trauma. The diagnosis of PTSD does not take into account how the developmental stages of children may affect their symptoms and how trauma can affect a child's development. The term developmental trauma disorder (DTD) has been proposed as the childhood equivalent of C-PTSD. This developmental form of trauma places children at risk for developing psychiatric and medical disorders. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk explains DTD as numerous encounters with interpersonal trauma such as physical assault, sexual assault, violence or death. It can also be brought on by subjective events such as abandonment, betrayal, defeat or shame. Repeated traumatization during childhood leads to symptoms that differ from those described for PTSD. Cook and others describe symptoms and behavioural characteristics in seven domains: * Attachment ‚Äì \\"problems with relationship boundaries, lack of trust, social isolation, difficulty perceiving and responding to others' emotional states\\" * Biology ‚Äì \\"sensory-motor developmental dysfunction, sensory-integration difficulties, somatization, and increased medical problems\\" * Affect or emotional regulation ‚Äì \\"poor affect regulation, difficulty identifying and expressing emotions and internal states, and difficulties communicating needs, wants, and wishes\\" * Dissociation ‚Äì \\"amnesia, depersonalization, discrete states of consciousness with discrete memories, affect, and functioning, and impaired memory for state-based events\\" * Behavioural control ‚Äì \\"problems with impulse control, aggression, pathological self-soothing, and sleep problems\\" * Cognition ‚Äì \\"difficulty regulating attention; problems with a variety of 'executive functions' such as planning, judgement, initiation, use of materials, and self-monitoring; difficulty processing new information; difficulty focusing and completing tasks; poor object constancy; problems with 'cause-effect' thinking; and language developmental problems such as a gap between receptive and expressive communication abilities.\\" * Self-concept ‚Äì \\"fragmented and disconnected autobiographical narrative, disturbed body image, low self- esteem, excessive shame, and negative internal working models of self\\". = Adults = Adults with C-PTSD have sometimes experienced prolonged interpersonal traumatization beginning in childhood, rather than, or as well as, in adulthood. These early injuries interrupt the development of a robust sense of self and of others. Because physical and emotional pain or neglect was often inflicted by attachment figures such as caregivers or older siblings, these individuals may develop a sense that they are fundamentally flawed and that others cannot be relied upon. This can become a pervasive way of relating to others in adult life, described as insecure attachment. This symptom is neither included in the diagnosis of dissociative disorder nor in that of PTSD in the current DSM-5 (2013). Individuals with Complex PTSD also demonstrate lasting personality disturbances with a significant risk of revictimization. Six clusters of symptoms have been suggested for diagnosis of C-PTSD: * alterations in regulation of affect and impulses; * alterations in attention or consciousness; * alterations in self-perception; * alterations in relations with others; * somatization; * alterations in systems of meaning. Experiences in these areas may include: *Changes in emotional regulation, including experiences such as persistent dysphoria, chronic suicidal preoccupation, self-injury, explosive or extremely inhibited anger (may alternate), and compulsive or extremely inhibited sexuality (may alternate). *Variations in consciousness, such as amnesia or improved recall for traumatic events, episodes of dissociation, depersonalization/derealization, and reliving experiences (either in the form of intrusive PTSD symptoms or in ruminative preoccupation). *Changes in self-perception, such as a sense of helplessness or paralysis of initiative, shame, guilt and self-blame, a sense of defilement or stigma, and a sense of being completely different from other human beings (may include a sense of specialness, utter aloneness, a belief that no other person can understand, or a feeling of nonhuman identity). *Varied changes in perception of the perpetrators, such as a preoccupation with the relationship with a perpetrator (including a preoccupation with revenge), an unrealistic attribution of total power to a perpetrator (though the individual's assessment may be more realistic than the clinician's), idealization or paradoxical gratitude, a sense of a special or supernatural relationship with a perpetrator, and acceptance of a perpetrator's belief system or rationalizations. *Alterations in relations with others, such as isolation and withdrawal, disruption in intimate relationships, a repeated search for a rescuer (may alternate with isolation and withdrawal), persistent distrust, and repeated failures of self-protection. *Changes in systems of meaning, such as a loss of sustaining faith and a sense of hopelessness and despair.  Diagnostics  C-PTSD was under consideration for inclusion in the DSM-IV but was not included when the DSM-IV was published in 1994. Neither was it included in the DSM-5. Post traumatic stress disorder continues to be listed as a disorder. = Differential diagnosis =  Post-traumatic stress disorder  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was included in the DSM-III (1980), mainly due to the relatively large numbers of American combat veterans of the Vietnam War who were seeking treatment for the lingering effects of combat stress. In the 1980s, various researchers and clinicians suggested that PTSD might also accurately describe the sequelae of such traumas as child sexual abuse and domestic abuse. However, it was soon suggested that PTSD failed to account for the cluster of symptoms that were often observed in cases of prolonged abuse, particularly that which was perpetrated against children by caregivers during multiple childhood and adolescent developmental stages. Such patients were often extremely difficult to treat with established methods. PTSD descriptions fail to capture some of the core characteristics of C-PTSD. These elements include captivity, psychological fragmentation, the loss of a sense of safety, trust, and self- worth, as well as the tendency to be revictimized. Most importantly, there is a loss of a coherent sense of self: this loss, and the ensuing symptom profile, most pointedly differentiates C-PTSD from PTSD. C-PTSD is also characterized by attachment disorder, particularly the pervasive insecure, or disorganized-type attachment. DSM-IV (1994) dissociative disorders and PTSD do not include insecure attachment in their criteria. As a consequence of this aspect of C-PTSD, when some adults with C-PTSD become parents and confront their own children's attachment needs, they may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively especially to their infants' and young children's routine distress‚Äîsuch as during routine separations, despite these parents' best intentions and efforts., pp. 123-149 Although the great majority of survivors do not abuse others, this difficulty in parenting may have adverse repercussions for their children's social and emotional development if parents with this condition and their children do not receive appropriate treatment. Thus, a differentiation between the diagnostic category of C-PTSD and that of PTSD has been suggested. C-PTSD better describes the pervasive negative impact of chronic repetitive trauma than does PTSD alone. PTSD can exist alongside C-PTSD, however a sole diagnosis of PTSD often does not sufficiently encapsulate the breadth of symptoms experienced by those who have experienced prolonged traumatic experience, and therefore C-PTSD extends beyond the PTSD parameters. C-PTSD also differs from continuous traumatic stress disorder (CTSD), which was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high- risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.  Traumatic grief  Traumatic grief or complicated mourning are conditions where both trauma and grief coincide. There are conceptual links between trauma and bereavement since loss of a loved one is inherently traumatic. If a traumatic event was life-threatening, but did not result in a death, then it is more likely that the survivor will experience post-traumatic stress symptoms. If a person dies, and the survivor was close to the person who died, then it is more likely that symptoms of grief will also develop. When the death is of a loved one, and was sudden or violent, then both symptoms often coincide. This is likely in children exposed to community violence. For C-PTSD to manifest traumatic grief, the violence would occur under conditions of captivity, loss of control and disempowerment, coinciding with the death of a friend or loved one in life-threatening circumstances. This again is most likely for children and stepchildren who experience prolonged domestic or chronic community violence that ultimately results in the death of friends and loved ones. The phenomenon of the increased risk of violence and death of stepchildren is referred to as the Cinderella effect. Similarities to and differentiation from borderline personality disorder C-PTSD may share some symptoms with both PTSD and borderline personality disorder. However, there is enough evidence to also differentiate C-PTSD from borderline personality disorder. It may help to understand the intersection of attachment theory with C-PTSD and BPD if one reads the following opinion of Bessel A. van der Kolk together with an understanding drawn from a description of BPD: > Uncontrollable disruptions or distortions of attachment bonds precede the > development of post-traumatic stress syndromes. People seek increased > attachment in the face of danger. Adults, as well as children, may develop > strong emotional ties with people who intermittently harass, beat, and, > threaten them. The persistence of these attachment bonds leads to confusion > of pain and love. Trauma can be repeated on behavioural, emotional, > physiologic, and neuroendocrinologic levels. Repetition on these different > levels causes a large variety of individual and social suffering. However, C-PTSD and BPD have been found by researchers to be completely distinctive disorders with different features. Notably, C-PTSD is not a personality disorder. Those with C-PTSD do not fear abandonment or have unstable patterns of relations; rather, they withdraw. They do not struggle with lack of empathy. There are distinct and notably large differences between Borderline and C-PTSD and while there are some similarities ‚Äì predominantly in terms of issues with attachment (though this plays out in completely different ways) and trouble regulating strong emotional effect (often feel pain vividly), the disorders are completely different in nature ‚Äì especially considering that C-PTSD is always a response to trauma rather than a personality disorder. > While the individuals in the BPD reported many of the symptoms of PTSD and > CPTSD, the BPD class was clearly distinct in its endorsement of symptoms > unique to BPD. The RR ratios presented in Table 5 revealed that the > following symptoms were highly indicative of placement in the BPD rather > than the CPTSD class: (1) frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined > abandonment, (2) unstable and intense interpersonal relationships > characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and > devaluation, (3) markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of > self, and (4) impulsiveness.

In > contrast, in CPTSD as in PTSD, there was little endorsement of items related > to instability in self-representation or relationships. Self-concept is > likely to be consistently negative and relational difficulties concern > mostly avoidance of relationships and sense of alienation. In addition 25% of those diagnosed with BPD have no known history of childhood neglect or abuse and individuals are six times as likely to develop BPD if they have a relative who was so diagnosed compared to those who do not. One conclusion is that there is a genetic predisposition to BPD unrelated to trauma. Researchers conducting a longitudinal investigation of identical twins found that \\"genetic factors play a major role in individual differences of borderline personality disorder features in Western society.\\" A 2014 study published in European Journal of Psychotraumatology was able to compare and contrast C-PTSD, PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder and found that it could distinguish between individual cases of each and when it was co-morbid, arguing for a case of separate diagnoses for each. BPD may be confused with C-PTSD by some without proper knowledge of the two conditions because those with BPD also tend to suffer from PTSD or to have some history of trauma. In Trauma and Recovery, Herman expresses the additional concern that patients who suffer from C-PTSD frequently risk being misunderstood as inherently 'dependent', 'masochistic', or 'self-defeating', comparing this attitude to the historical misdiagnosis of female hysteria. However, those who develop C-PTSD do so as a result of the intensity of the traumatic bond ‚Äì in which someone becomes tightly biolo-chemically bound to someone who abuses them and the responses they learned to survive, navigate and deal with the abuse they suffered then become automatic responses, imbedded in their personality over the years of trauma ‚Äì a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.  Treatment  While standard evidence-based treatments may be effective for treating post traumatic stress disorder, treating complex PTSD often involves addressing interpersonal relational difficulties and a different set of symptoms which make it more challenging to treat. According to the United States Department of Veteran Affairs: > The current PTSD diagnosis often does not fully capture the severe > psychological harm that occurs with prolonged, repeated trauma. People who > experience chronic trauma often report additional symptoms alongside formal > PTSD symptoms, such as changes in their self-concept and the way they adapt > to stressful events. The utility of PTSD-derived psychotherapies for assisting children with C-PTSD is uncertain. This area of diagnosis and treatment calls for caution in use of the category C-PTSD. Dr. Julian Ford and Dr. Bessel van der Kolk have suggested that C-PTSD may not be as useful a category for diagnosis and treatment of children as a proposed category of developmental trauma disorder (DTD). According to Courtois & Ford, for DTD to be diagnosed it requires a > history of exposure to early life developmentally adverse interpersonal > trauma such as sexual abuse, physical abuse, violence, traumatic losses of > other significant disruption or betrayal of the child's relationships with > primary caregivers, which has been postulated as an etiological basis for > complex traumatic stress disorders. Diagnosis, treatment planning and > outcome are always relational. Since C-PTSD or DTD in children is often caused by chronic maltreatment, neglect or abuse in a care-giving relationship the first element of the biopsychosocial system to address is that relationship. This invariably involves some sort of child protection agency. This both widens the range of support that can be given to the child but also the complexity of the situation, since the agency's statutory legal obligations may then need to be enforced. A number of practical, therapeutic and ethical principles for assessment and intervention have been developed and explored in the field: * Identifying and addressing threats to the child's or family's safety and stability are the first priority. * A relational bridge must be developed to engage, retain and maximize the benefit for the child and caregiver. * Diagnosis, treatment planning and outcome monitoring are always relational (and) strengths based. * All phases of treatment should aim to enhance self- regulation competencies. * Determining with whom, when and how to address traumatic memories. * Preventing and managing relational discontinuities and psychosocial crises. = Adults = Trauma Recovery Model - Judith Herman Dr. Judith Lewis Herman, in her book, Trauma and Recovery, proposed that a complex trauma recovery model that occurs in three stages: # establishing safety, # remembrance and mourning for what was lost, # reconnecting with community and more broadly, society. Herman believes recovery can only occur within a healing relationship and only if the survivor is empowered by that relationship. This healing relationship need not be romantic or sexual in the colloquial sense of \\"relationship\\", however, and can also include relationships with friends, co-workers, one's relatives or children, and the therapeutic relationship. Complex trauma means complex reactions and this leads to complex treatments. [need reference] Hence, treatment for C-PTSD requires a multi-modal approach. It has been suggested that treatment for complex PTSD should differ from treatment for PTSD by focusing on problems that cause more functional impairment than the PTSD symptoms. These problems include emotional dysregulation, dissociation, and interpersonal problems. Six suggested core components of complex trauma treatment include: # Safety # Self-regulation # Self-reflective information processing # Traumatic experiences integration # Relational engagement # Positive affect enhancement The above components can be conceptualized as a model with three phases. Every case will not be the same, but one can expect the first phase to consist of teaching adequate coping strategies and addressing safety concerns. The next phase would focus on decreasing avoidance of traumatic stimuli and applying coping skills learned in phase one. The care provider may also begin challenging assumptions about the trauma and introducing alternative narratives about the trauma. The final phase would consist of solidifying what has previously been learned and transferring these strategies to future stressful events. Neuroscientific and Trauma Informed Interventions In practice, the forms of treatment and intervention varies from individual to individual since there is a wide spectrum of childhood experiences of developmental trauma and symptomatology and not all survivors respond positively, uniformly, to the same treatment. Therefore, treatment is generally tailored to the individual. Recent neuroscientific research has shed some light on the impact that severe childhood abuse and neglect (trauma) has on a child's developing brain, specifically as it relates to the development in brain structures, function and connectivity among children from infancy to adulthood. This understanding of the neurophysiological underpinning of complex trauma phenomena is what currently is referred to in the field of traumatology as 'trauma informed' which has become the rationale which has influenced the development of new treatments specifically targeting those with childhood developmental trauma. Dr. Martin Teicher, a Harvard psychiatrist and researcher, has suggested that the development of specific complex trauma related symptomatology (and in fact the development of many adult onset psychopathologies) may be connected to gender differences and at what stage of childhood development trauma, abuse or neglect occurred. For example, it is well established that the development of dissociative identity disorder among women is often associated with early childhood sexual abuse. Use of Evidence Based Treatment and Its Limitations One of the current challenges faced by many survivors of complex trauma (or developmental trauma disorder) is support for treatment since many of the current therapies are relatively expensive and not all forms of therapy or intervention are reimbursed by insurance companies who use evidence based practice as a criteria for reimbursement. Cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy are well established forms of evidence based intervention. These treatments are approved and endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and the Veteran's Administration. While standard evidence-based treatments may be effective for treating standard post traumatic stress disorder, treating Complex PTSD often involves addressing interpersonal relational difficulties and a different set of symptoms which make it more challenging to treat. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs acknowledges, > the current PTSD diagnosis often does not fully capture the severe > psychological harm that occurs with prolonged, repeated trauma. People who > experience chronic trauma often report additional symptoms alongside formal > PTSD symptoms, such as changes in their self-concept and the way they adapt > to stressful events. For example, \\"limited evidence suggests that predominantly cognitive behavioral therapy (an evidenced based treatment)[is]effective, [it does not] suffice to achieve satisfactory end states, especially in Complex PTSD populations\\". Treatment Challenges It is widely acknowledged by those who work in the trauma field that there is no one single, standard, 'one size fits all' treatment for complex PTSD. There is also no clear consensus regarding the best treatment among the greater mental health professional community which included clinical psychologists, social workers, licensed therapists MFTs) and psychiatrists. Although most trauma neuroscientifically informed practitioners understand the importance of utilizing a combination of both 'top down' and 'bottom up' interventions as well as including somatic interventions (sensorimotor psychotherapy or somatic experiencing or yoga) for the purposes of processing and integrating trauma memories. Survivors with complex trauma often struggle to find a mental health professional who is properly trained in trauma informed practices. They can also be challenging to receive adequate treatment and services to treat a mental health condition which is not universally recognized or well understood by general practitioners. Dr. Allistair and Dr. Hull echo the sentiment of many other trauma neuroscience researchers (including Dr. Bessel van der Kolk and Dr. Bruce D. Perry) who argue: > Complex presentations are often excluded from studies because they do not > fit neatly into the simple nosological categorisations required for research > power. This means that the most severe disorders are not studied adequately > and patients most affected by early trauma are often not recognised by > services. Both historically and currently, at the individual as well as the > societal level, \\"dissociation from the acknowledgement of the severe impact > of childhood abuse on the developing brain leads to inadequate provision of > services. Assimilation into treatment models of the emerging affective > neuroscience of adverse experience could help to redress the balance by > shifting the focus from top-down regulation to bottom-up, body-based > processing.\\" Complex post trauma stress disorder is a long term mental health condition which is often difficult and relatively expensive to treat and often requires several years of psychotherapy, modes of intervention and treatment by highly skilled, mental health professionals who specialize in trauma informed modalities designed to process and integrate childhood trauma memories for the purposes of mitigating symptoms and improving the survivor's quality of life. Delaying therapy for people with complex PTSD, whether intentionally or not, can exacerbate the condition. Recommended treatment modalities and interventions There is no one treatment which has been designed specifically for use with the adult complex PTSD population (with the exception of component based psychotherapy ) there are many therapeutic interventions used by mental health professionals to treat post traumatic stress disorder. As of February 2017, the American Psychological Association PTSD Guideline Development Panel (GDP) strongly recommends the following for the treatment of PTSD: #cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and trauma focused CBT #cognitive processing therapy (CPT) #cognitive therapy (CT) #prolonged exposure therapy (PE) The American Psychological Association also conditionally recommends #brief eclectic psychotherapy (BEP) #eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) #narrative exposure therapy (NET) While these treatments have been recommended, there is still on-going debate regarding the best and most efficacious treatment for complex PTSD. Many commonly used treatments are considered complementary or alternative since there still is a lack of research to classify these approaches as evidenced based. Some of these additional interventions and modalities include: #biofeedback #dyadic resourcing (used with EMDR) #emotionally focused therapy # emotional freedom technique (EFT) or tapping #Equine-assisted therapy #expressive arts therapy #internal family systems therapy #dialectical behavior therapy(DBT) #family systems therapy #group therapy #neurofeedback #psychodynamic therapy #sensorimotor psychotherapy #somatic experiencing #yoga, specifically trauma-sensitive yoga = Arguments Against Complex PTSD Diagnosis = Though acceptance of the idea of complex PTSD has increased with mental health professionals, the fundamental research required for the proper validation of a new disorder is insufficient as of 2013. The disorder was proposed under the name DES-NOS for inclusion in the DSM-IV but was rejected by members of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) committee of the American Psychiatric Association for lack of sufficient diagnostic validity research. Chief among the stated limitations was a study which showed that 95% of individuals who could be diagnosed with the proposed DES-NOS were also diagnosable with PTSD, raising questions about the added usefulness of an additional disorder. Following the failure of DES-NOS to gain formal recognition in the DSM-IV, the concept was re-packaged for children and adolescents and given a new name, developmental trauma disorder. Supporters of DTD appealed to the developers of the DSM-5 to recognize DTD as a new disorder. Just as the developers of DSM-IV refused to included DES-NOS, the developers of DSM-5 refused to include DTD due to a perceived lack of sufficient research. One of the main justifications offered for this proposed disorder has been that the current system of diagnosing PTSD plus comorbid disorders does not capture the wide array of symptoms in one diagnosis. Because individuals who suffered repeated and prolonged traumas often show PTSD plus other concurrent psychiatric disorders, some researchers have argued that a single broad disorder such as C-PTSD provides a better and more parsimonious diagnosis than the current system of PTSD plus concurrent disorders. Conversely, an article published in BioMed Central has posited there is no evidence that being labeled with a single disorder leads to better treatment than being labeled with PTSD plus concurrent disorders. Complex PTSD embraces a wider range of symptoms relative to PTSD, specifically emphasizing problems of emotional regulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal problems. Diagnosing complex PTSD can imply that this wider range of symptoms is caused by traumatic experiences, rather than acknowledging any pre-existing experiences of trauma which could lead to a higher risk of experiencing future traumas. It is also asserts that this wider range of symptoms and higher risk of traumatization are related by hidden confounder variables and there is no causal relationship between symptoms and trauma experiences. In the diagnosis of PTSD, the definition of the stressor event is narrowly limited to life- threatening events, with the implication that these are typically sudden and unexpected events. Complex PTSD vastly widened the definition of potential stressor events by calling them adverse events, and deliberating dropping reference to life-threatening, so that experiences can be included such as neglect, emotional abuse, or living in a war zone without having specifically experienced life-threatening events. By broadening the stressor criterion, an article published by the Child and Youth Care Forum claims this has led to confusing differences between competing definitions of complex PTSD, undercutting the clear operationalization of symptoms seen as one of the successes of the DSM. One of the primary arguments for a new disorder has been the claim that individuals who experience complex post traumatic stress symptomatology are often misdiagnosed, and as a consequence may be given inappropriate or inadequate treatment interventions. The movement to recognize complex PTSD has been criticized for approaching the process of diagnostic validation backwards. The typical process for validation of new disorders is to first publish case studies of individual patients who manifest all of these issues and clearly demonstrate how they are different from patients who experienced different types of traumas. There are no known case reports with prospective repeated assessments to clearly demonstrate that the alleged symptoms followed the adverse events. Then the next step would be to conduct well-designed group studies. Instead, supporters of complex PTSD have pushed for recognition of a disorder before conducting any of the prospective repeated assessments that are needed.

Wounded at the end of the war, he returned to the United Kingdom in April 1902. He was later promoted to Major and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel, and served in the First World War. He wrote the standard history: The Grenadier Guards in the Great War of 1914‚Äì1918. 3 vols. Published in 1920. Courtier He also held several court positions, notably as Equerry-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria from 1894 to 1901, as Assistant Keeper of the Privy Purse and Assistant Private Secretary to Queen Victoria from 1897 to 1901, to King Edward VII from 1901 to 1910 and to King George V from 1910 to 1914; as Keeper of the Privy Purse from 1914 to 1935, and as Lieutenant Governor of Windsor Castle from 1928 to 1935. In 1906, Ponsonby was appointed to the Order of the Bath as a Companion (CB). In 1910, he was promoted to be a Knight Commander (KCVO) and was promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) in the 1921 New Year Honours. In 1914, he was sworn of the Privy Council. In the 1935 Birthday Honours, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Sysonby, of Wonersh in the County of Surrey. Family Lord Sysonby married Victoria, daughter of Colonel Edmund Hegan Kennard, on 17 May 1899, at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks. She later became a well-known cook book author. They had three children: *Victor Alexander Henry Desmond Ponsonby (19 June 1900 ‚Äì 24 November 1900) *Hon. Loelia Mary Ponsonby (1902‚Äì1993) *Hon. Edward Gaspard Ponsonby (1903‚Äì1956) Lord Sysonby died in London in October 1935, aged 68, only four months after his elevation to the peerage, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. He was succeeded in the barony by his surviving son Edward. Lady Sysonby died in 1955. His autobiography Recollections of Three Reigns, edited and published posthumously in 1951, is full, frank and entertaining.

He also edited Letters of the Empress Frederick (1928) and published Sidelights on Queen Victoria (1930). The Ponsonby family The Ponsonby family has played a leading role in British life for two centuries. His father was Sir Henry Ponsonby who was Private Secretary to Queen Victoria. His grandfather, Frederick was badly wounded at the Battle of Waterloo, but survived to become a British Army general. Lady Caroline, better known to history under her married name of Lady Caroline Lamb, was the wife of the future Prime Minister Lord Melbourne and lover of the poet Lord Byron. This lady was also a key figure in a film ‚Äì played by Sarah Miles ‚Äì in 1972. The father of the two siblings, Frederick's great-grandfather, was the 3rd Earl of Bessborough. The man wounded at Waterloo is not to be confused with another Ponsonby depicted on film, his kinsman General Sir William Ponsonby, whose death ‚Äì possibly due to not risking his best horse in battle ‚Äì at the hands of a group of lancers is an incident noted in the film 'Waterloo'. Frederick's daughter, Loelia, married the 2nd Duke of Westminster. Notes  References  * Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition).

Meadowdale International Raceway was a race track located in Carpentersville, Illinois. It was used for motor racing from 1958 to 1968. The track's first life Meadowdale Raceway was built in 1958 north of Carpentersville, Illinois, to attract development to the suburbs of Chicago. It is located at the intersection of Illinois Route 31 and Huntley Road. At the time the track was built, Carpentersville was a very small industrial town on the Fox River that was just beginning to see the effects of the post-war housing boom in the United States. One developer, Besinger, who was erecting a housing subdivision along the river, decided to install a road race track across the highway from the subdivision as an attraction. As originally opened, the track was long, with a steep 180 degree curve, known as the Monza Wall, leading onto the 3/4 mile front straight. The Chicago Region of the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) conducted the track's inaugural event on September 13 and September 14, 1958, a regional race. However, SCCA indicates that the inaugural race was something less than a complete success: :Seeding of the grounds was unsatisfactory or had not been done, and dust enveloped everything and everyone. Earth embankments lined much of the course and several turns did not offer escape roads. The weekend was marred by a fatal accident during Race Three. SCCA began a long series of negotiations with track management over improvements that were needed, but despite this, the 1959 and 1960 SCCA seasons contained no events at Meadowdale. Several major wrecks and the fatality that took place during the inaugural events gave it a reputation as a \\"killer\\", which it was never able to rid itself of. The track was based on European road-racing courses. Unfortunately, it was more challenging than what a lot of amateur drivers in America were accustomed to as it had no wide run-off areas that American amateurs expected. Additionally, the first few days of racing at the track were faced with high winds that created dust-clouds which obstructed the vision of drivers. In addition, these dust-clouds filthied spectators, making for upset crowds. Reports of massive traffic jams on nearby roads, and a long walk from the track's parking area only added to the difficulties faced by the newly opened race track. Management attempted to solve the track's problems, but lacked funding to make all the alterations that were needed. Issues with the track were numerous. The paving on the Monza wall was rough, and the minute number of trackside run-off areas that the track had ended abruptly at the bridges (which were only as wide as the paving). This made for hard walls at severe angles with the track, a critical danger if any driver was to lose control when approaching them. In addition to SCCA events, the track also hosted USAC auto racing, AMA motorcycle racing, and kart racing during its life. The only events that proved marginally successful in making profit were rental events which were able to attract a modest attendance of spectators. The track never was able to garner enough cash to support the facility. Unfortunately, the track never committed to making a series of safety improvements requested by the various sanctioning bodies, and this, together with competition by nearby Road America, eventually led to the track's demise. The last major auto racing event, an SCCA Trans-Am Series race, held July 7 and July 8, 1968 as a last- ditch effort to save the track by making it a major professional racecourse. Nevertheless, the track closed soon afterwards in 1969. The track's second life Various proposals were put forth over the years to bring racing back to Meadowdale. However, these ran into the same problems that had brought down the track in the first place: unsafe track conditions, and competition from Road America and Blackhawk Farms Raceway, and none were ever successful. In 1994, a group of local park districts purchased the north of the track's land for use as part of a new forest preserve, and purchased the remainder of the site in 2002. The track site is now, formally, a forest and nature preserve and recreational area known as \\"Raceway Woods\\". However, the volunteers who maintain the site have recognized its importance as a race track, and have done much to keep the original track and related structures in place in the form of a hiking trail. Raceway Woods is maintained by the Dundee (IL) Township Park District and the Forest Preserve District of Kane County. References * Fosbender, Ross (2005). Meadowdale International Raceway.

The character first appeared in Bagge's self-published Comical Funnies in 1981. In the 1990s Buddy became an iconic symbol of Seattle underground culture, with the character being associated with slackerdom and the grunge movement, something which his creator sees as fairly unintentional on his part. Bagge created Buddy as a fairly unlikeable character as a commentary on shallow hipster culture, but the character was immensely popular, with members of Generation X strongly identifying with Buddy and his problems. In this way he may have been seen as an antihero and archetype of 1990s underground culture. Bagge had the character enact storylines based on events from his past, such as his family life, adolescence and his move to Seattle in the 1980s. Buddy is a disaffected adolescent who is a self-proclaimed outsider. He is directionless and unmotivated, drifting through life without goals and commonly has a cynical attitude to almost everything. By his twenties he has not changed much, although he is rather more comfortable in his hipster persona, fitting into the Seattle grunge scene and listening to obscure rock music as proof of his hip credentials. He has a brittle personality and is quick to anger, often becoming violent and getting into fights, be it with his family, friends, spouses or rivals. He has a ruthless and selfish streak which he uses to his advantage in his business dealings as a music promoter, memorabilia salesman and junkyard dealer. Buddy's appearance developed from early sketches until by the mid-1980s he had arrived at the recognisable figure with a black crop of hair covering his eyes with a bulbous nose and perpetually dressed in a flannel shirt and jeans. He kept the same look for nearly 20 years, until Bagge changed it to reflect the character's ageing and midlife crisis. Since 2004 he has been depicted with a shaved head wearing a sailor's hat. Buddy has had two major romantic relationships, firstly with Valerie Russo, an upper middle class feminist, and then with the neurotic and troubled Lisa Leavenworth, who later becomes his wife and the mother of his son. Publication history and development Buddy Bradley first appeared with the rest of the Bradleys in Bagge's short-lived early 1980s publication with John Holmstrom and J. D. King, Comical Funnies. The Bradleys family was based on Bagge's own, with Buddy being the character he most identified with. He recognised \\"what a great vehicle the Bradley's oldest son, Buddy, served as a way of re-telling stories from my own distant- and all too vivid - past.\\" Bagge has said Buddy's life shadows events in his own but Buddy is ten years younger than Bagge. This, according to Bagge, \\"creates just the right amount of time and distance between myself and my own experiences where I can laugh at my problems and woes rather than cry and wail about them\\". Buddy appeared with Bradleys again in Neat Stuff from 1985 until 1989, featuring particularly in issues # 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. He then became the main character in Hate, featuring in all 30 issues from 1989 to 1998, and in all 9 of the Hate Annuals up until the present. The Bradleys stories from Neat Stuff were collected in the 1999 6-issue comic series The Bradleys, which was also compiled into a trade paperback. Buddy Bradley in a \\"The Bradleys\\" strip from 1982 (far left). Bagge originally drew the character with a pointy nose and flared left Initial drawings of Buddy have his defining features; a large nose and hair that covers his eyes. Differences were the nose was originally hooked with flared nostrils and his floppy bangs were neater with individual strands of hair instead of being solid black. Bagge perfected the most well-known rendition of Buddy around 1986 and did not significantly change the look of the character until 2004. He was always drawn with black scruffy hair covering his eyes, a large nose and dressed in sneakers, blue jeans and, until 1994, a checked flannel shirt. In \\"The Bradleys\\" strips in Neat Stuff, Buddy has acne spots all over his face. By the time of Hate the acne had cleared up. By the time of The Bradleys stories he was drawn in a fairly ligne claire style with occasional shading. In the early copies of Hate, Bagge began using cross- hatching extensively, so Buddy's face always had a dark, textured look. When Bagge began employing a number of inkers and colorists after issue #14, the style returned to much cleaner, simpler-lined characters like in Neat Stuff, although they were more exaggerated in facial features and the body shape of Buddy became less angular with more rounded, spaghetti-like limbs. Bagge's use of highly exaggerated, less naturalistic facial expressions to make the characters express strong emotions increased over this period, until it became a trademark of Hate. When he was angry Buddy would be drawn with jagged, fang- like teeth, a large gaping mouth and huge bulging eyes, with steam rising from his head. When he moved back to Jersey, Buddy stopped wearing his trademark flannel shirt and could be seen in a variety of plain single color shirts, most usually a bright yellow shirt. In 2004, for Hate Annual #5, Bagge started drawing Buddy with a shaved head, wearing a sailor's hat and an eyepatch. This is how he currently appears. Bagge explained this change in Buddy's appearance by saying \\"I realized Buddy still looked the same as he did when he was a teen, even though I had aged him well into his mid-30s. So I decide to age him visually somehow, while also highlighting his gradual descent into a crazy old coot who works at a dump. He doesn't need the eye patch, of course; it's just an affectation.\\" He also said the decision to change Buddy related to a comedy routine by his collaborator, comedian Dana Gould. \\"He talks about when he was a kid, his dream job was to be the crazy old guy with one eye that works at the dump. When I was a kid, we'd go to the dump, and I used to wish that I was that guy. So I decided that that should be Buddy.\\" Other artists who have drawn Buddy are David Coulson, an illustrator friend of Bagge's, who drew a Bradleys story which appeared in Weirdo #13 in 1985, and German artist Guido Sieber, who drew three Buddy stories in 1998 for a German version of Hate called Kra√ü (Krass). In this story, Sieber moved the character from Seattle to Berlin. Jim Blanchard was also credited as Art Director and was credited alongside Bagge on the title pages on the last 15 issues of Hate. right Fictional character biography =Neat Stuff= Buddy, born 1967, was raised in an unnamed suburb of Passaic County, New Jersey in a Roman Catholic family. As he became a high school student he had frequent violent disagreements with his family as he tried to find independence and began to question their conservative values. He spent time with schoolfriends Tom and Kevin driving around getting stoned, although he became increasingly isolated from them too. In the story \\"Hippy House\\" from Neat Stuff #9 he mentions he believes he was considered the \\"school weirdo\\". He also started spending an increasing amount of time in second hand record stores, where he met Jay, an older role model whom Buddy admired, leading to him become interested in 1960s music. After graduation he became a small-time drug dealer selling marijuana to friends and spending the money on vinyl records. When his stash was stolen by two small children, Buddy abandoned his younger brother Butch in a 7-11 before wrecking his fathers car. Fearing his parent's wrath he was afraid to return home. At first he slept on a highly polluted beach. =Hate= Throughout most of the eighties, Buddy moved around the country with his high school friend Leonard \\"Stinky\\" Brown, moving around from Brooklyn to Hoboken then to Minneapolis, before setting out for the West Coast and ending up in Seattle, moving into an apartment with the reclusive science fiction geek George. Buddy dated a depressed and somewhat insane girl named Lisa upon his arrival, but the pair stopped seeing each other after a while. Buddy got a job at a used bookstore. Visiting a pool hall with Stinky, he met Valerie and the pair began dating. Buddy had concerns that Valerie may be too high class and intellectual for him. However the couple stayed together for some time, and it was Buddy's first serious relationship, with him meeting Valerie's parents. Valerie's housemate turned out to be Lisa, who made frequent passes at Buddy and attempted to make him break up with Valerie. Buddy reacted angrily to this, literally dumping Lisa in a trash can. Buddy managed a teenage rock band, which became locally successful when Buddy convinced Stinky to be lead singer. At the same time Buddy became distant from Valerie as he put more time into the band and she left him, going off with her boss to Paris. Buddy left his rock manager job when he had an argument with the band at the start of their first tour and went back to Seattle, while Stinky left for California and became a failed porn star. He began a strange relationship with the mentally unstable Lisa, which led to him quitting his job at the bookstore. He then tried becoming a second hand collectables dealer, but ran into trouble with rival dealer and criminal Yahtzi Murphy making it difficult for him to work in that field in Seattle again. With his apartment becoming increasingly crowded and scared of reprisals from Murphy, Buddy returned to his parents in Jersey with Lisa following. Buddy bought a second hand monster truck to drive around in. He reunited with Jay, who suggested they go into the collectables and memorabilia business together. They set up a store in Paterson, N.J., which was fairly successful, but Buddy challenged Jay over his erratic approach to business and his drug habit, and ended up buying out Jay's share of the business, becoming the sole owner. In Hate #22 Buddy's father was hit by a truck and died instantly. His mother started dating another man and was never around the house, meaning the Bradley family home was taken over by his criminal acquaintances and neighbors. Buddy moved into the backroom of his store when his mother moved to Florida with her new partner. His relationship with Lisa got worse, as he was confused and angered by her mood swings and erratic behaviour, having an unhelpful foray into relationship counseling. Eventually Lisa left him for a bi-sexual co-worker. Tracking her down with the help of Jay's girlfriend, Buddy found her living in an apartment in New York City. After going on a series of disastrous dates with other women, Buddy was reunited with a calmer, medicated Lisa and they had sex; he then helped her sneak away from her increasingly domineering girlfriend. At the end of Hate #30, Lisa revealed she was pregnant with Buddy's child, and when she was determined not to get an abortion he married her, rather than have his son being brought up by Lisa's family or put up for adoption. =Hate Annual= At the start of the Hate Annuals, Buddy was still in New Jersey with his and Lisa's baby Harold, running his collectables business and selling things on the growing internet. He was making a good living at it but was bored and felt stuck in a rut. He tried finding a different career, considered becoming a tour guide with Jay and tried being a UPS delivery man, but he resisted working with his former nefarious friends and acquaintances. Moving to a house next to a junk yard, he eventually went into business with Jay as a scrap metal dealer. He shaved his hair off and started wearing an eyepatch and sailor cap. He returned to Seattle with Lisa to visit her ailing parents, Lisa deciding to stay and sort out their affairs, so Buddy planned to return home to New Jersey with Harold and look after him on his own for a while. Personality Bagge has said the character is semi-autobiographical, being a more bad-tempered, aggressive and pessimistic version of himself. In their review of the Buddy Does Seattle trade paperback, Publishers Weekly commented on Buddy: \\"The title character is perhaps the most honestly portrayed everyman the medium has ever seen, an antihero whose utter obnoxiousness, \\"who cares\\" attitude and disdain for everyone and everything around him make him as believable as any comics character can be.\\" In other media In October 2009, Fox announced it had commissioned a script for a pilot of The Bradleys cartoon series. The script was to be written by Bagge and Matthew Lawton, who were also to be executive producers along with Barry Katz, Brian Volk-Weiss and Michael Pelmont. The character appeared in a 2006 Greek television commercial for cellphone company Mo'Mad.

It comprised the Val d'Aosta region (Italy) and the Canton Valais (Switzerland). Its strongest indigenous tribe were the Salassi. Their territory was annexed by emperor Augustus in 15 BC. Its chief city was Augusta Praetoria Salassorum (Aosta).  Etymology  The province was named for poeninus mons, the Roman name of the Great St Bernard Pass. Near the pass was a sanctuary dedicated to Jupiter Poeninus. Because the name Poeninus is similar to Poenus (Latin for \\"Carthaginian\\"), some Roman authors inferred that the Carthaginian general Hannibal crossed this part of the Alps in his famous march on Italy in 218 BC, using either the Great St Bernard or Little St Bernard passes. The Roman historian Livy explains that Poeninus was actually a corruption of Penninus, the name of a deity worshipped by a local tribe. Livy adds that it was implausible that Hannibal took such a northerly route, as these high mountain passes would have been inaccessible at the time.Livy XXI.38 Tacitus mentions the Alpes Poeninae in connection with the movements of Otho.Tac. Historiae 1.87.2 http://latin.packhum.org/loc/1351/4/86/93-101 Most historians agree, according to Polybius that Hannibal's army passed through the Alps via the region of the Segusii, and the pass known today as Montgen√®vre.  History  After the region was conquered in 15 BC, it was incorporated into Raetia, a large district which stretched from the central Alps to the Danube. The population included a number of Celtic tribes, including the Nantuates and Seduni on the northern side of the St. Bernard Pass and the Salassi on the southern side. By the time of Emperor Claudius (41-54 AD) the tribes were generally Romanized and the Vallis Poenina district was removed from the Raetia et Vindolicia province. Vallis Poenina included much of the valley north of the St. Bernard Pass. A new capital civitas was established near the ruins of Octodurus (civitas Vallensium now Martigny) and the residents enjoyed at least the protections of the Latin Rights. The Vallis Poenina district was merged with the Alpes Graiae or Alpes Atrectianae district to form the Alpes Graiae et Poeninae province. By the 3rd century AD there were several senator ranked families living in the province. Under the reforms of Diocletian, the province became part of the Diocese of Gaulliae. In 381, the first Bishop of the region, Theodul, was mentioned. After the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the region was invaded by the Burgundians and incorporated into their kingdom. In 574 it was invaded by the Lombards and came under their authority. The Roman name and borders fell into disuse and by the Dark Ages it was part of Sapaudia.

Rich development of surface roots. 150px Passive hydroponics, semi-hydroponics or passive subirrigation is a method of growing plants without soil, peat moss, or bark. Instead an inert porous medium transports water and fertilizer to the roots by capillary action. Water and fertilizer are held in a reservoir and conducted to the roots as necessary, reducing labor and providing a constant supply of water to the roots. In the simplest method, the pot sits in a shallow solution of fertilizer and water or on a capillary mat saturated with nutrient solution. Since routine maintenance is much simplified, passive hydroponics can reduce the labor required to maintain a large collection of plants. The Kratky Method is a specialized passive hydroponic technique which involves plants suspended in net pots above a non-circulating water and nutrient reservoir. The various hydroponic media available contain more air space than more traditional potting mixes, delivering increased oxygen to the roots. Allowing air to reach the roots is particularly important in preventing root rot in epiphytic plants such as orchids and bromeliads, whose roots are exposed to the air in nature. Passive hydroponics also may add additional ambient humidity through evaporation. It is important in passive subirrigation to wash out the system from time to time to remove salt accumulation. Plants that require drying between waterings or a dry dormant period may fail to thrive under the constant moisture of passive hydroponics.  Media  The medium is a key component. It must provide capillary action that will keep the plant uniformly moist. It has to be something that won‚Äôt decompose and provides adequate air space. Many media are available for passive hydroponics, but the most common are expanded clay pellets, coconut husk chips, perlite, vermiculite, diatomite, and rock wool. These are frequently used in combination.

The text was adapted from Octavio Paz's poem El c√°ntaro roto (The Broken Water-Jar), and inspired by the experience of the composer witnessing a desert cloudburst. On his website, Whitacre stated that he composed it after approached by Jocelyn K. Jensen in 1991 to write a piece for her high school choir. The first section is a cappella, notable for its dissonant tone clusters. Whitacre notates long, sustained notes with text to be spoken at random by each individual singer. Following the opening section is a baritone solo, which is then followed by the development of a new a cappella theme. This section continues into a spoken, arrhythmic incantatory solo with background. In the section titled \\"The Cloudburst\\", handbells (which are directed to be hidden from the audience) play a written two bars, and then play at random as the choir crescendos into an aleatoric section, which is signaled by a loud clap of \\"thunder\\". During this time, the choir begins claps, snaps, and thigh smacks in order to imitate the sound of rain. A thunder sheet, bass drum, handbells, suspended cymbal, wind chimes, and piano contribute to the effect of a thunderstorm. The storm gradually builds then fades, and the ending of the piece mirrors the beginning section, with the choir arpeggiating as the piano voices block chords. \\"Cloudburst\\" was the title feature of an album by Stephen Layton's chamber choir Polyphony. The album included other works by Whitacre and was nominated for the 2007 Grammy Award in best Choral Performance. A concert band version, commissioned for the Indiana All-State Band, was released by Whitacre in 2001.

Shipowners typically hire a licensed crew and captain rather than take charge of the vessel in person.

Welles was a United States district court case between former 1981 Playboy Playmate of the Year (\\"PMOY\\") Terri Welles and Playboy Enterprises, Inc. in which Welles was accused of trademark infringement and trademark dilution in her use of Playboy's trademarked terms in the metatags of her website. Facts Welles maintained a website which identified her as a former PMOY and displayed the registered trademarked terms Playboy, Playmate of the Year, and Playmate of the Month and the unregistered trademark \\"PMOY\\" in metatags, wallpaper, banner ads, and the masthead. Playboy sued Welles, claiming both trademark infringement and trademark dilution. Defendant was featured on the cover of a 1981 Playboy magazine. Defendant was a Playboy model and Playmate of the Year who used these trademarked terms to describe herself via her personal website. Plaintiff's sued Defendant for Defendant's under two theories: trademark infringement and trademark dilution. Opinion of the Court The Court held that nominative use (a type of fair use for discussing the product itself) is permitted where: #The product or service can not be readily identified without using the trademark (i.e. trademark is descriptive of a person, place, or product attribute); #Only so much of the mark may be used as is reasonably necessary for identification (e.g. the words may be reasonably used but not the specific font or logo); and #The user does nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder - which applies even if the nominative use is commercial. Here, the Ninth Circuit Court applied the nominative fair use test to the defendant and concluded the Defendant's use of these trademarked items was permissible because there was no other practical way for the Defendant to describe herself. The Plaintiff was relying on the decision in Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp., to support the contention that the Defendant's use of Playboy trademark in her web site infringes on its trademark by causing likelihood of confusion shown on the basis of initial interest confusion. However, the court added that the Plaintiff's reliance on Brookfield was misplaced. None of the cases which Brookfield discusses involved fair use defense or a use of trademarks in the metatags which accurately and fairly described the contents of the web page or web site. The court defined Plaintiff's use of the theory of 'initial interest of confusion' as \\"confusion of 'consumer attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion.\\" In order for this type confusion to be actionable under the Lanham Act, several factors must be reviewed: #Evidence of the initial interest confusion as being \\"damaging and wrongful,\\" #Evidence that confusion between two products \\"will mistakenly lead the consumer to believe there is some connection between the two and therefore develop an interest in the defendant's line that it would otherwise not have,\\" or #Evidence that the \\"situation offers an opportunity for sale not otherwise available by enabling defendant to interest prospective customers by confusion with the plaintiff's product.\\" In this case, the Plaintiff failed to present any of the facts indicating: #Any initial interest confusion was \\"damaging and wrongful;\\" #Anyone believes or is likely to believe there is a connection Welles' site and Playboy's. #Welles received \\"opportunities for sale not otherwise available\\" by confusing web users; or #Any of Welles' actual customers were in the \\"appreciable number,\\" or majority of people who when plugging in one of the Plaintiff's trademark terms into a web browser search engine, was \\"looking for Playboy's official site.\\" There was also no evidence Welles intended to divert Plaintiff's customers to her web site by trading on Playboy's goodwill. This intent was relevant since the court in Brookfield stated that in \\"Dr. Seuss, the Ninth Circuit explicitly recognized that the use of another's trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion, may be still an infringement.\\" Brookfield at 1062. Conclusion The court wanted to render an analysis that was flexible and reflective of \\"emerging technologies\\", but also wanted to uphold common sense principles of trademark law. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's conclusion with respect to Welles' use of metatags because the court considered the use nominative.

Pilot operates the Pilot Food Mart convenience stores in Tennessee. Along with FJ Management, Pilot is joint- owner of Pilot Flying J, the largest truck stop chain in the United States.  History  Pilot Company was founded by James Haslam Jr. in 1958 in Weber City, Virginia when he purchased an existing gasoline station. By 1965, Pilot owned 12 stations, and was selling 5 million gallons of fuel yearly. Pilot built its first convenience store in 1976, and converted the rest of its locations into convenience stores. In 1981, Pilot built its first travel center, and has focused on that aspect of its business ever since. 1988 saw Pilot begin its concentration on expanding its travel center network in a nationwide presence. Also in 1988, Pilot opened its first travel center with a fast food restaurant inside. On September 1, 2001, Pilot and Marathon Petroleum Company formed Pilot Travel Centers, LLC. On July 1, 2010, Pilot and Flying J's travel center chains merged to form Pilot Flying J. The two brands maintain their separate identities in the merged company. =Investigation of price gouging= On September 14, 2008, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum issued subpoenas to Pilot for investigation of price gouging in the days following Hurricane Ike. Sports sponsorship =NASCAR= In 1998, Pilot sponsored Gary Bradberry and Triad Motorsports in NASCAR. This venture was short lived, however, ending in 1999. Pilot returned to NASCAR in 2011 with the help of Scott Wombold when it became the primary sponsor of Rusty Wallace Racing driver Michael Annett in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. As the deal came after the Flying J merger, both Pilot and Flying J are primary sponsors of the car. In 2012, when Annett moved to the Nationwide team of Richard Petty Motorsports, Pilot Flying J followed him to his new team. In 2014, Annett moved to the Sprint Cup Series, driving the No. 7 Chevrolet for Tommy Baldwin Racing, and again Pilot Flying J followed him, re-entering the Cup Series for the first time since 1998. The sponsorship followed Annett to the No. 46 Chevrolet for HScott Motorsports on the Sprint Cup Series in 2016 and to the No. 5 Chevrolet for JR Motorsports in the Xfinity Series in 2017. =Pittsburgh Steelers= In 2008, Pilot president James (Jimmy) Haslam III, son of founder James (Jim) Haslam II, purchased a 16% stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers as part of the team's ownership restructuring due to some heirs of the Rooney family retaining stakes in gambling enterprises such as horse tracks and race horse breeding stables, violating NFL rules. NFL approves Rooney's ownership plan] It was not known at the time if it would lead to a sponsorship deal between the two at Pittsburgh-area Pilot Travel Centers locations, or possibly a sponsorship deal with the NFL in general nationwide. The Rooney family retained control of the franchise itself. =Cleveland Browns= In August 2012, Pilot president Jimmy Haslam purchased a controlling interest in the Cleveland Browns from Randy Lerner for over $1 billion, pending approval of other NFL owners. Under NFL rules, he needed to sell his share in the Steelers before buying the Browns. Haslam has made plans with the Rooney family to sell his Steelers interest, and is expected to sell that stake by the time the Browns purchase is finalized in October 2012. Haslam sold the naming rights to FirstEnergy to become FirstEnergy Stadium.

The film stars Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Shirley Temple in a story about a teenager's crush on an older man. Upon its release, The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer was well received by both audiences and critics. Sidney Sheldon won an Oscar for his screenplay. Plot Margaret Turner (Myrna Loy) and Susan Turner (Shirley Temple) are sisters who live together. Susan is an intelligent 17-year-old high-school student with a habit of forming short-lived interests after hearing the regular guest lectures at the school. Margaret is a judge, and Susan's guardian. Richard Nugent (Cary Grant), a handsome and sophisticated artist, is a defendant in Margaret's courtroom, charged by ADA Tommy Chamberlain (Rudy Vallee) with starting a nightclub brawl. She releases him with a warning when it becomes clear that the fight was started by two women fighting over him. He proceeds to Susan's school, where he is the guest lecturer for the day--and as he speaks, Susan becomes infatuated with him. After the talk she finds a reason to spend time with him and suggests she model for him; that evening, she puts on a sophisticated dress and sneaks away from home and into his apartment while he is out. Richard has no sooner discovered Susan in his apartment than Tommy and Margaret arrive to rescue her from his presumed seduction. Richard assaults Tommy and is held in jail until Matt Beemish (Ray Collins), who is the court psychiatrist and also Margaret and Susan's uncle, intervenes and explains the true situation. He recommends allowing Susan to date Richard until the infatuation burns itself out; Tommy will drop the assault charge if Richard complies. At a high-school basketball game, Richard tries unsuccessfully to boost Susan's image of Jerry White (Johnny Sands), the boyfriend she dumped for him. Later, at a school picnic, Susan persuades Richard to enter a series of novelty races (open to adult family members), where he loses repeatedly to Tommy. But in the main event, an obstacle course, she asks Jerry to help Richard win. Because he still loves her, Jerry complies, helping him directly at one point, then colliding with Tommy so that Richard does win the event. Meanwhile, Richard and Margaret are becoming attracted to each other, to the discomfiture of Tommy, who sees Richard as a habitual troublemaker and wants Margaret for himself. Hoping Richard will stop seeing Margaret if he no longer has to date Susan, Tommy announces he is dropping the charge. But Richard and Margaret go out to a nightclub, where they are interrupted in succession by all the other main characters as well as a former girlfriend of Richard's. They all part angrily. Afterwards, though, Matt is able to talk sense into Susan, and she returns to Jerry. Matt finds out that Richard has decided to take a trip and is able to manipulate affairs so that Margaret will travel with him. Learning that Tommy is coming to arrest Richard on trumped-up charges, Matt forestalls him by telling police at the airport that Tommy is a mental patient with delusions of being an ADA. Richard and Margaret are happily surprised to meet each other as they approach the plane to board.

Planned as a series of 24 magazines, since reduced to 22, INTERVIEW: Jason Lutes Talks the Final Days of ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù, Comic Book Resources, July 28, 2015 then re-released in book form, it describes life in Berlin from 1928 to 1933, during the decline of the Weimar Republic. Plot =Book One= The first eight issues were compiled into a book titled Berlin: City of Stones, published in 2000. It starts with Marthe M√ºller, an art student, arriving in Berlin. One story arc details the start of her life in Berlin, focusing on her relationship to journalist Kurt Severing. A second storyline describes a working-class family which breaks up due to differing political views, the mother, Gudrun, eventually joining the communists with her daughters Elga and Silvia, while the father takes his son Heinz to the Nazis. The book ends with Gudrun's death in the massacre of 1 May 1929, the International Workers Day (known in German as Blutmai). =Book Two= Issues 9‚Äì16 have been compiled in Berlin Book Two: City of Smoke, published in 2008.Back to the City - Jason Lutes on Berlin 2, Newsarama, October 1, 2008 In the second volume, the relationship between Marthe and Kurt disintegrates, partly due to the influence of Kurt's former lover Margarethe. Marthe develops a relationship with fellow art student Anna. Gudrun's daughter Silvia struggles to stay alive by herself; Elga was apparently taken in by her father, but Silvia refuses to join the Nazis and blames the Communists for Gudrun's death on Blutmai. Another major subplot involves a group of African- American jazz musicians who perform at a Berlin nightclub. The volume concludes with the electoral victory of the Nazi Party in September 1930. =Book Three= The final volume comprises issues 17‚Äì22 and is called City of Light.

He was originally the band's bassist from 1976 to 1982. In 2002, he returned to the group after a 20-year hiatus, replacing his own replacement, the late Howie Epstein. Biography Blair's father was a Navy man, so the family relocated every few years throughout the United States as well as within Japan and Hong Kong. As a teenager in Japan, Ron was in a locally famous rock band. But it was the music scenes in Macon, Georgia, and Gainesville, Florida, where Blair felt most at home. In Gainesville, Blair was a member of the band RGF. His sister is Janice Blair, a singer who was married to Gregg Allman from 1973 to 1975. Career Blair eventually moved to Los Angeles, and there teamed up with fellow Gainesville musicians Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench and Stan Lynch. Campbell and Tench, along with Tom Petty, had been members of the popular Gainesville band Mudcrutch. Mudcrutch had relocated from Gainesville to Los Angeles, but subsequently broke up after failing to sign a recording contract. After the breakup, Tench recruited Campbell, Blair and Lynch to record demos in the hopes of getting a new record deal in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Denny Cordell, president of Shelter Records, signed Tom Petty to his record label, after which Petty met up with his former bandmates and Floridians and asked if they would like to become his band. They agreed, and soon became known as the Heartbreakers. Blair went on to play with the band through its first four albums, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, You're Gonna Get It!, Damn the Torpedoes and Hard Promises. In the last couple of years of his first stint with the band, Blair was considering leaving and was not always available, thus being occasionally replaced with other bassists, including Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn, on his last two albums. In spite of his departure in 1982, he would continue to make occasional guest appearances on studio albums all the way up to Southern Accents. He rejoined the Heartbreakers on March 18, 2002, to perform at the band‚Äôs Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. The reunion led to Blair‚Äôs return to the group for its 2002 summer tour. He helped finish The Last DJ album and was present for all subsequent albums and tours following the death of his replacement Howie Epstein, creating a seamless transition. Aside from the Heartbreakers, Blair has designed albums for Barbara Morrison and Carlos Zialcita. He has also played on albums by Kirstin Candy, Stevie Nicks, Del Shannon, Slobberbone and The Tremblers. Blair was also part of the original lineup of The Dirty Knobs, Mike Campbell's side-project band as well as Campbell's band the Blue Stingrays recording the album Surf-N-Burn in 1997. Tom Petty said this about Blair: \\"It‚Äôs great having him [back] in the band. It reminds me of the old days just seeing him around. ... We hung out. We knew each other. And he was always the best bass player in town.\\"Orange County Register, August 26, 2002 Blair has been seen with many basses (including a Rickenbacker 4001 and a H√∂fner Club bass, both owned by Petty), but is best known for playing Fender Jazz Basses, having used a black Jazz Bass in his early years with the Heartbreakers and a white Jazz Bass since his return to the band. His bass rig in the early days of the Heartbreakers was a Vox Super Beatle. When he returned to the band in 2002, and for the tours in 2002 and 2003, Blair was seen using a blond piggyback Fender Bassman amplifier. Since 2005, Blair's bass rig is a modern Ampeg SVT.

From 1914 through 1926, Wambsganss played for the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, and Philadelphia Athletics. He is best remembered for making one of the most spectacular defensive plays in World Series history, an unassisted triple play. Early life Wambsganss was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of German descent. \\"The Wambsganss name was German in origin, though the best a German professor at Concordia College in Fort Wayne, Indiana, could tell him was that it seemed to combine components of the word for overcoat, or at least a word that might have been used as overcoat in early 20th century German usage.\\" He attended Concordia College and studied for the ministry before entering professional baseball. Major league career In a 13-season career, Wambsganss posted a .259 batting average with seven home runs and 521 run batted in in 1492 games played. Due to his long surname, Wambsganss was often called \\"Wamby\\" by headline writers. Wambsganss was the regular second baseman of the Cleveland Indians for ten years. Over a thirteen-year Major League career, he amassed 4,269 assists with 3,420 putouts and turned 605 double plays. He committed only 375 errors in 8,064 chances for a significant .954 fielding percentage. Batting from the second or eighth spot, Wambsganss averaged 74.2 runs per year from 1919 to 1923. He scored a career-high 89 runs in 1922. He hit a career- high .295 in 1918 and hit .290 in 1923, his last season with Cleveland. He was sent to the Boston Red Sox in the same trade that brought first baseman George Burns to the Indians. In 1924 with Boston, Wambsganss hit .275 and collected career-highs in hits (174) and runs (93). After a sub-par season in 1925, he was sold to the Philadelphia Athletics. He finished his Major League career with the A's in 1926, batting .352 in 54 games. =World Series triple play= Bill Wambsganss, and his unassisted triple play victims: Pete Kilduff, Clarence Mitchell and Otto Miller. Photo by L. Van Oeyen, Library of Congress archives. In game five of the 1920 World Series played at League Park, Wambsganss caught a fifth-inning line drive batted by Clarence Mitchell, stepped on second base to retire Pete Kilduff, and tagged Otto Miller coming from first base, to complete the only unassisted triple play in World Series history. Earlier in the game, Wambsganss' teammate Elmer Smith hit the first grand slam in World Series history off Brooklyn Robins pitcher Burleigh Grimes, in the first inning with none out. The historic blast scored Charlie Jamieson, Wambsganss, Tris Speaker, and Smith. Brooklyn fell to the Indians in an 8‚Äì1 loss. Cleveland winning pitcher Jim Bagby helped himself by hitting a three-run home run in the third. It was the first home run hit by a pitcher in modern World Series history. After the World Series, Cleveland fans presented Wambsganss with a medal to commemorate the unassisted triple play. The medal was lost the following April while Wambsganss was traveling aboard a train. Post-MLB career After his last year in the Major Leagues, Wambsganss played for Triple-A Kansas City of the American Association. After coaching New Orleans of the Southern League in 1930, he returned to the Kansas City club as manager in 1931. Additionally, he managed for four seasons in the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) for the Fort Wayne Daisies (1945‚Äì46) and the Muskegon Lassies (1947‚Äì48). In November 1988, Wambsganss and the rest of the AAGPBL received recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York dedicated a permanent display to the entire league. The gymnasium at Concordia Theological Seminary is named in honor of him. Later life When interviewed in the 1960s by Lawrence Ritter for the classic 1966 oral history The Glory of Their Times, Wambsganss recalled: \\"Funny thing, I played in the big leagues for 13 years, 1914 through 1926, and the only thing that anybody seems to remember is that once I made an unassisted triple play in a World Series. Many don't even remember the team I was on, or the position I played, or anything. Just Wambsganss-unassisted triple play! You'd think I was born on the day before and died on the day after.\\" Wambsganss died of heart failure in Lakewood, Ohio, on December 8, 1985. He was 91 years old. Wambsganss was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland. In the 1958 film Teacher's Pet, Clark Gable and Gig Young argue whether Wambsganss' triple play took place in the 1920 or 1921 World Series.

He went on to co- create the series Sym-Bionic Titan and, in 2013, developed, wrote, storyboarded, executively produced, and directed a revival of Mickey Mouse short cartoons. Life and career Paul's father, Rich Rudish, created the character Rainbow Brite for Hallmark and was art director for the 1985 animated film Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer. Paul went into animation, too, studying in the Character Animation program at California Institute of the Arts. Rudish did character design and storyboard work early in his career, most notably for Batman: The Animated Series. When Cartoon Network started producing new shows as Cartoon Network Studios, he quickly expanded into new roles on series created by Genndy Tartakovsky and Craig McCracken. He wrote, designed characters, or directed art for episodes of series including Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, and Samurai Jack. He moved up to directing art for the entire production of the 2003 Star Wars: Clone Wars miniseries. In 2010, Rudish earned his first co-creator credit for the series Sym-Bionic Titan, which he co-created with Tartakovsky and Samurai Jack writer Bryan Andrews. He wrote the series and also designed the characters and Sym-Bionic Units. Around the same time, he provided development art for the first season and second season opener of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. Rudish's next project saw him work with characters not created by either him, Tartakovsky or McCracken: Mickey Mouse and friends. Rudish created, executive-produced and directed a new series of 3.5-minute episodes titled simply Mickey Mouse. The series uses the character designs and personalities from the earliest Mickey, Donald, and Goofy shorts, even using lesser known characters such as Clarabelle. Many of the shorts use a classic story structure in which Mickey must overcome a series of obstacles to achieve a seemingly simple goal, though some highlight the more playful aspects of animation, such as Mickey's cartoony evasive moves in \\"No Service\\" or the ability of characters to detach and reattach their ears (complete with temporary deafness) in \\"Bad Ear Day\\". Despite the retro feel, the developers used modern animation techniques and tools. Further, they did update some elements, most notably the vivid, detailed backgrounds and super-smooth animation in fast-paced scenes. They also took stylistic risks, basing some episodes entirely in foreign countries. In most of these, the characters speak sparingly, if at all, while in \\"Croissant de Triomphe\\", set in Paris, the characters speak entirely in French. The first episode, \\"No Service\\", was released on June 28, 2013 on Disney Channel, Disney.com and WATCH Disney Channel. Awards Rudish has received a number of Emmy and Annie award nominations, winning three Emmys and one Annie. He shared Emmy wins for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More) in 2004 and '05 for Star Wars: Clone Wars miniseries with that show's production staff, also earning nominations for Dexter's Laboratory and Samurai Jack. In 2013 he won for Outstanding Short- Format Animated Program for the Mickey Mouse episode \\"Croissant de Triomphe\\". In 1997, Rudish shared an Individual Achievement: Writing in a TV Production Annie with Jason Butler Rote for the Dexter's Laboratory episode \\"The Beard to Be Feared\\". He also received Annie nominations in 1994 for Best Individual Achievement for Artistic Excellence in the Field of Animation for an episode of 2 Stupid Dogs and in 2003 for Outstanding Character Design in an Animated Television Production for The Powerpuff Girls episode \\"Members Only\\".

The symptoms of both disorders can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and social withdrawal. While impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning is required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, in schizophreniform disorder an individual's level of functioning may or may not be affected. While the onset of schizophrenia is often gradual over a number of months or years, the onset of schizophreniform disorder can be relatively rapid. Like schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder is often treated with antipsychotic medications, especially the atypicals, along with a variety of social supports (such as individual psychotherapy, family therapy, occupational therapy, etc.) designed to reduce the social and emotional impact of the illness. The prognosis varies depending upon the nature, severity, and duration of the symptoms, but about two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder go on to develop schizophrenia. Signs and symptoms  Schizophreniform disorder is a type of mental illness that is characterized by psychosis and closely related to schizophrenia. Both schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), have the same symptoms and essential features except for two differences: the level of functional impairment and the duration of symptoms. Impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning is usually present in schizophrenia, particularly near the time of first diagnosis, but such impairment may or may not be present in schizophreniform disorder. In schizophreniform disorder, the symptoms (including prodromal, active, and residual phases) must last at least 1 month but not more than 6 months, while in schizophrenia the symptoms must be present for a minimum of 6 months.American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association.  Cause  The exact cause of the disorder remains unknown, and relatively few studies have focused exclusively on the etiology of schizophreniform disorder. Like other psychotic disorders, a diathesis‚Äìstress model has been proposed, suggesting that some individuals have an underlying multifactorial genetic vulnerability to the disorder that can be triggered by certain environmental factors. Schizophreniform disorder is more likely to occur in people with family members who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Diagnosis If the symptoms have persisted for at least one month, a provisional diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder can be made while waiting to see if recovery occurs. If the symptoms resolve within 6 months of onset, the provisional qualifier is removed from the diagnosis. However, if the symptoms persist for 6 months or more, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder must be revised. The diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may be considered when the duration of symptoms is less than one month. The main symptoms of both schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia may include: *delusions, *hallucinations, *disorganized speech resulting from formal thought disorder, *disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms, such as *an inability to feel a range of emotions (flat affect), *an inability to experience pleasure (anhedonia), *impaired or decreased speech (aphasia), *a lack of desire to form relationships (asociality), and *a lack of motivation (avolition). Treatment Various modalities of treatment, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and various other psychosocial and educational interventions, are used in the treatment of schizophreniform disorder. Pharmacotherapy is the most commonly used treatment modality as psychiatric medications can act quickly to both reduce the severity of symptoms and shorten their duration. The medications used are largely the same as those used to treat schizophrenia, with an atypical antipsychotic as the usual drug of choice. Patients who do not respond to the initial atypical antipsychotic may benefit from being switched to another atypical antipsychotic, the addition of a mood stabilizer such as lithium or an anticonvulsant, or being switched to a typical antipsychotic. Treatment of schizophreniform disorder can occur in inpatient, outpatient, and partial hospitalization settings. In selecting the treatment setting, the primary aims are to minimize the psychosocial consequences for the patient and maintain the safety of the patient and others. While the need to quickly stabilize the patient's symptoms almost always exists, consideration of the patient's severity of symptoms, family support, and perceived likelihood of compliance with outpatient treatment can help determine if stabilization can occur in the outpatient setting. Patients who receive inpatient treatment may benefit from a structured intermediate environment, such as a sub-acute unit, step-down unit, partial hospital, or day hospital, during the initial phases of returning to the community. As improvement progresses during treatment, help with coping skills, problem- solving techniques, psychoeducational approaches, and eventually occupational therapy and vocational assessments are often very helpful for patients and their families. Virtually all types of individual psychotherapy are used in the treatment of schizophreniform disorder, except for insight-oriented therapies as patients often have limited insight as a symptom of their illness. Since schizophreniform disorder has such rapid onset of severe symptoms, patients are sometimes in denial about their illness, which also would limit the efficacy of insight-oriented therapies. Supportive forms of psychotherapy such as interpersonal psychotherapy, supportive psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy are particularly well suited for the treatment of the disorder. Group psychotherapy is usually not indicated for patients with schizophreniform disorder because they may be distressed by the symptoms of patients with more advanced psychotic disorders.  Prognosis  The following specifiers for schizophreniform disorder may be used to indicate the presence or absence of features that may be associated with a better prognosis: *With Good Prognostic Features, used if at least two of the following features are present: **Onset of prominent psychotic symptoms within 4 weeks of the first noticeable change in usual behavior or functioning **Confusion or perplexity at the height of the psychotic episode **Good premorbid social and occupational functioning **Absence of blunted or flat affect *Without Good Prognostic Features, used if two or more of the above features have not been present. The presence of negative symptoms and poor eye contact both appear to be prognostic of a poor outcome. Many of the anatomic and functional changes seen in the brains of patients with schizophrenia also occur in patients with schizophreniform disorder. However, at present there is no consensus among scientists regarding whether or not ventricular enlargement, which is a poor prognostic factor in schizophrenia, has any prognostic value in patients with schizophreniform disorder. According to the American Psychiatric Association, approximately two-thirds of patients diagnosed with \\"provisional\\" schizophreniform disorder are subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia; the remaining keep a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. Epidemiology Schizophreniform disorder is equally prevalent among men and women. The most common ages of onset are 18‚Äì24 for men and 18‚Äì35 for women. While the symptoms of schizophrenia often develop gradually over a period of years, the diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder require a much more rapid onset. Available evidence suggests variations in incidence across sociocultural settings. In the United States and other developed countries, the incidence is low, possibly fivefold less than that of schizophrenia. In developing countries, the incidence is substantially higher, especially for the subtype \\"With Good Prognostic Features\\". In some of these settings schizophreniform disorder may be as common as schizophrenia.

In order to ensure the reliable operation of circuits employing transistors, it is necessary to scientifically model the physical phenomena observed in their operation using transistor models. There exists a variety of different models that range in complexity and in purpose. Transistor models divide into two major groups: models for device design and models for circuit design. Models for device design The modern transistor has an internal structure that exploits complex physical mechanisms. Device design requires a detailed understanding of how device manufacturing processes such as ion implantation, impurity diffusion, oxide growth, annealing, and etching affect device behavior. Process models simulate the manufacturing steps and provide a microscopic description of device \\"geometry\\" to the device simulator. \\"Geometry\\" does not mean readily identified geometrical features such as a planar or wrap-around gate structure, or raised or recessed forms of source and drain (see Figure 1 for a memory device with some unusual modeling challenges related to charging the floating gate by an avalanche process). It also refers to details inside the structure, such as the doping profiles after completion of device processing. Figure 1: Floating-gate avalanche injection memory device FAMOS With this information about what the device looks like, the device simulator models the physical processes taking place in the device to determine its electrical behavior in a variety of circumstances: DC current‚Äìvoltage behavior, transient behavior (both large-signal and small-signal), dependence on device layout (long and narrow versus short and wide, or interdigitated versus rectangular, or isolated versus proximate to other devices). These simulations tell the device designer whether the device process will produce devices with the electrical behavior needed by the circuit designer, and is used to inform the process designer about any necessary process improvements. Once the process gets close to manufacture, the predicted device characteristics are compared with measurement on test devices to check that the process and device models are working adequately. Although long ago the device behavior modeled in this way was very simple mainly drift plus diffusion in simple geometries today many more processes must be modeled at a microscopic level; for example, leakage currents in junctions and oxides, complex transport of carriers including velocity saturation and ballistic transport, quantum mechanical effects, use of multiple materials (for example, Si-SiGe devices, and stacks of different dielectrics) and even the statistical effects due to the probabilistic nature of ion placement and carrier transport inside the device. Several times a year the technology changes and simulations have to be repeated. The models may require change to reflect new physical effects, or to provide greater accuracy. The maintenance and improvement of these models is a business in itself. These models are very computer intensive, involving detailed spatial and temporal solutions of coupled partial differential equations on three-dimensional grids inside the device. Such models are slow to run and provide detail not needed for circuit design. Therefore, faster transistor models oriented toward circuit parameters are used for circuit design. Models for circuit design Transistor models are used for almost all modern electronic design work. Analog circuit simulators such as SPICE use models to predict the behavior of a design. Most design work is related to integrated circuit designs which have a very large tooling cost, primarily for the photomasks used to create the devices, and there is a large economic incentive to get the design working without any iterations. Complete and accurate models allow a large percentage of designs to work the first time. Modern circuits are usually very complex. The performance of such circuits is difficult to predict without accurate computer models, including but not limited to models of the devices used. The device models include effects of transistor layout: width, length, interdigitation, proximity to other devices; transient and DC current‚Äìvoltage characteristics; parasitic device capacitance, resistance, and inductance; time delays; and temperature effects; to name a few items. =Large-signal nonlinear models= Nonlinear, or large signal transistor models fall into three main types: Physical models : These are models based upon device physics, based upon approximate modeling of physical phenomena within a transistor. Parameters within these models are based upon physical properties such as oxide thicknesses, substrate doping concentrations, carrier mobility, etc. In the past these models were used extensively, but the complexity of modern devices makes them inadequate for quantitative design. Nonetheless, they find a place in hand analysis (that is, at the conceptual stage of circuit design), for example, for simplified estimates of signal-swing limitations. Empirical models : This type of model is entirely based upon curve fitting, using whatever functions and parameter values most adequately fit measured data to enable simulation of transistor operation. Unlike a physical model, the parameters in an empirical model need have no fundamental basis, and will depend on the fitting procedure used to find them. The fitting procedure is key to success of these models if they are to be used to extrapolate to designs lying outside the range of data to which the models were originally fitted. Such extrapolation is a hope of such models, but is not fully realized so far. =Small-signal linear models= Small-signal or linear models are used to evaluate stability, gain, noise and bandwidth, both in the conceptual stages of circuit design (to decide between alternative design ideas before computer simulation is warranted) and using computers. A small-signal model is generated by taking derivatives of the current‚Äìvoltage curves about a bias point or Q-point. As long as the signal is small relative to the nonlinearity of the device, the derivatives do not vary significantly, and can be treated as standard linear circuit elements. An advantage of small signal models is they can be solved directly, while large signal nonlinear models are generally solved iteratively, with possible convergence or stability issues. By simplification to a linear model, the whole apparatus for solving linear equations becomes available, for example, simultaneous equations, determinants, and matrix theory (often studied as part of linear algebra), especially Cramer's rule. Another advantage is that a linear model is easier to think about, and helps to organize thought. Small-signal parameters A transistor's parameters represent its electrical properties. Engineers employ transistor parameters in production-line testing and in circuit design. A group of a transistor's parameters sufficient to predict circuit gain, input impedance, and output impedance are components in its small-signal model. A number of different two- port network parameter sets may be used to model a transistor. These include: * Transmission parameters (T-parameters), * Hybrid-parameters (h-parameters), * Impedance parameters (z-parameters), * Admittance parameters (y-parameters), and * Scattering parameters (S-parameters). Scattering parameters, or S parameters, can be measured for a transistor at a given bias point with a vector network analyzer. S parameters can be converted to another parameter set using standard matrix algebra operations.

At the time, the term \\"Southern Syria\\" referred to a political position which implied support for the Greater Syria nationalism associated with the kingdom promised to the Hashemites of the Hejaz by the British during World War I. After the war, the Hashemite prince Faisal attempted to establish such a Pan-Syrian or pan-Mashriq state (i.e. a united kingdom that would comprise all of modern Syria, as well as Mount Lebanon and Palestine, including Transjordan, so that Palestine would be the province of \\"Southern Syria\\"). This kingdom was to be united with the other Hashemite domains in Hejaz and Iraq, thus contributing in large measure towards the fulfillment of Pan-Arabist ambitions. However, he was stymied by conflicting promises made by the British to different parties (see Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement, Balfour Declaration and McMahon‚ÄìHussein Correspondence), leading to the Franco-Syrian War, which destroyed the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920. The newspaper Suriyya al-Janubiyya espoused this Pan-Syria idea alongside Pan- Arabist and Palestinian nationalist political positions. These positions were not contradictory at the time and, in fact, were mutually supportive. With the disappearance of Faisal's Syrian kingdom, the idea of Pan-Syrianism lost support, and the newspaper focused on Palestinian nationalism and opposition to British rule and Zionist immigration, prior to the suppression of the paper by the British authorities in April during the 1920 Nebi Musa riots.

He was born and raised into a family of Muslim scholars in Damascus. His father was Bader al-Din al-Hasani, one of the most respected Islamic scholars in the late nineteenth century.  History  The young Hasani studied Islamic theology with his father, and in 1905 became his personal assistant. He trained young students of his generation in conduct and thought. In 1912, he became a member in the committee for school reform, which was established by the Municipality of Damascus. In 1916, he became editor-in- chief of al-Sharq (The East), a daily newspaper published by Jamal Pasha, the Ottoman Governor of Syria. He held this position throughout World War I. When the war ended in 1918, his father delegated him to meet with King Faisal I, the first post-Ottoman ruler of Syria, and explain the conditions and needs of Muslim establishments in Syria. Faisal was impressed by Hasani's eloquence and, in March 1920, appointed him Director of the Royal Palace. He retained this post until the French occupied Syria in July 1920 and dethroned Faysal, setting up their mandate in Syria. Hasani went to Paris and established secret channels with the French, promising them absolute support if they agreed to support his political ambitions. The French government accepted and began grooming him for future leadership in Syria.  Years in office  In 1925, the French High Commissioner Maurice Sarrail asked Hasani to form a government during the climax of a national uprising in the Arab Mountain. Hasani failed to create a suitable composition. He was given a second opportunity and succeeded, creating a government of prominent figures on 15 February 1928. With no presidential office in Syria, Hasani was vested with supreme presidential powers, but had to submit all of his actions and decrees to the French High Commissioner in Beirut. His cabinet included the historian and scholar Muhammad Kurd Ali as Minister of Education, the attorney Said Mahasin as Minister of Justice, and Jamil al-Ulshi, an Ottoman-trained officer and ex- prime minister, as Minister of Finance. The opponents to his regime were mainly hard-line nationalists who criticized the French connections of Ulshi, Mahasin, and Hasani, claiming that they had not contributed to the nationalist movement since the French Mandate was imposed in 1920. In April 1928, Hasani held office for three months on the Constituent Assembly that drafted the first republican constitution for Syria. Hasani ruled Syria with three different cabinets from February 1928 until November 1931. The opposition, headed by the National Bloc, accused him of tampering with the ballots to secure his election through Interior Minister Sa‚Äôid Mahasin. In 1932, Hasani nominated himself for presidential office. The French, who were under mounting nationalist pressure to reform the political system in Syria, distanced themselves from the elections. With no proper French backing, he was defeated at the polls. Hasani protested to government authorities in Paris, who compensated him with the post of Prime Minister in the administration of President Mohammad Ali al-Abid. The National Bloc, Hasani's prime opponent in local politics, staged a countrywide strike that lasted for sixty days, demanding that France address the issue of Syrian independence in a serious manner. During the strike, commercial life was brought to a standstill and hundreds of Syrians were arrested and deported to remote prisons on the Syrian-Turkish border. Hasani arrested many leaders of the National Bloc, including Saadallah al-Jabiri from Aleppo and Fakhri al-Barudi from Damascus. Shukri al-Kuwatli and Nasib al-Bakri, two politicians from Damascus, were placed under house-arrest. The entire ordeal embarrassed the French who in turn, called the Bloc leaders into independence talks in Paris. When a Franco- Syrian treaty was ready, the Bloc leadership assumed power and Hasani moved into the opposition to the new administration of President Hashim al-Atassi, the leader of the National Bloc.  Final years  Taj al-Din al-Hasani (left) with President Alfred Naqqache of Lebanon in 1941. The ex-Prime Minister remained on the margins of political life until 1941, when following the Bloc downfall, General Charles de Gaulle appointed him President of Syria on 12 September 1941, after having failed to prevail upon Hashim al-Atassi to return to office. He was required to contain the nationalist movement and provide funds for France's war effort in Europe. To raise money, President Hasani increased his taxes and raised the price of bread, thereby alienating himself throughout the poor districts of Syria. De Gaulle rewarded Hasani's services by officially recognizing Syria's independence on 27 September 1941 and promising complete French evacuation once the war in Europe ended. The French General abrogated a law formulated in the 1920s that divided the Alawite Mountain and the Arab Mountain into independent zones, thereby re- incorporating them into the Syrian Republic. France, however, was given the right to retain military bases throughout the country and receive economic, financial, and political privileges in Syria. Hasani then tried to distance himself from French influence and began befriending members of the National Bloc. He also tried to convince the French to re-instate the democratically elected Parliament of 1936‚Äì1939, but his efforts proved futile. He died suddenly of a heart attack on 17 January 1943. His son-in-law Munir al-Ajlani claims that in his final years, Taj al-Din al-Hasani wanted to distance himself from the French and project the image of a true nationalist, but died before that was done. He was the first Syrian head of state to die while in office.

It was described as new to science (initially as a subspecies of the common treecreeper C. familiaris) in 1995 from 14 specimens taken at four sites in the mountains of western Sichuan, China. In 2002, it was realized that these birds constituted a distinct species, and subsequent researchTietze et al. (2006) suggests it is closest to the Nepal treecreeper (C. nipalensis). This bird is relatively large with a long tail. Its bill is strikingly short while the throat is whitish and darker underparts. Sichuan treecreeper sings aloud with a rapid and high-pitched trill. This species is believed to be a relict species breeding in open old- growth stands of the conifer Faber's fir (Abies fabri) at high altitude (2,500-2,830 m), although it is thought to undertake localized altitudinal migrations in the winter (occurring down to at least 1,600 m). It is known from five sites: Labahe Natural Reserve (Tianquin County), Dayi County, Shuanghe town (Ebian County), Wawu Shan (Hongya County), and Wujipung in Wolong Biosphere Reserve. Within this small area, the species is thought to be patchily distributed because it seems to be confined to old stands of the Faber's fir. The species forages for invertebrates in the upper story of large trees by creeping along branches and trunks. Intensive logging of primary coniferous forests in the last century, even at high altitudes in the mountains of western China, has seriously reduced the potential range of this species. The Wawu Shan table mountain has steep slopes which are inaccessible to lumberjacks in the absence of extensive road construction, but it is not yet formally protected, and there are plans to open up the regions for tourism by building a cable railway. The population was estimated at less than 1000 adult individuals, occurring over a range of 19,690 km2. Formerly classified as vulnerable species by the IUCN,BLI (2004) new research has shown it to be not as rare as it was believed. Consequently, it is downlisted to near threatened status in 2008.BLI (2008) Footnotes  References  * BirdLife International (BLI) (2008): [2008 IUCN Redlist status changes].

By far the smallest of the R&D; departments at Nintendo with about 20 employees, R&D3;‚Äôs primary responsibilities were the technical hardware design and development software for both the arcade systems and the later home consoles, the Famicom and the NES. The team also helped create bank switching and the MMC chips in the NES cartridges. R&D3; also made forays into video game development, producing few such famous titles such as the Punch-Out!! and StarTropics series of games. R&D3; was also responsible for releasing a series of sports games for Nintendo, including Pro Wrestling, NES Play Action Football, and Ice Hockey. These titles were aimed primarily at the American market, where they sold well. A major limitation with the NES cartridges was the inability to save directly on the cartridge. The cartridges contain RAM, which are easily writable but lose all stored memory as soon as the power is turned off. Takeda is credited for his team‚Äôs development of the battery back-up memory, which was first used in the North American and European versions of Shigeru Miyamoto‚Äôs The Legend of Zelda. It supplies a long-life power source to the RAM chip, maintaining the saved data even when the main power supply is cut or the cartridge is removed. Takeda is also credited with the invention of the Analog controller for the Nintendo 64 system, a style which has since been copied by Microsoft and Sony for their respective systems. Takeda‚Äôs R&D3; team was renamed Integrated Research and Development in 2000. In that same year, they worked with Conexant to create broadband and modem peripherals for the Nintendo GameCube. Takeda was promoted in 2002 to senior management director, while still maintaining his position as general manager. Following the death of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata on July 11, 2015, Takeda was appointed as acting Representative Director of Nintendo alongside Shigeru Miyamoto, effective on July 13.http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2015/150713e.pdf Retrieved 2015-07-12 He was relieved of this position on September 16, when Tatsumi Kimishima assumed the role of the company's president. He was also appointed the position of \\"Technology Fellow\\" at that time, providing expert advice to Kimishima as a \\"support network\\", alongside Miyamoto. Takeda was given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 21st D.I.C.E. Awards in February 2018 for his contributions and leadership in Nintendo's hardware development. Development of the Wii Takeda was one of the lead developers on the Wii console. He was known for disagreement with the contemporary model of adding every technical and graphical improvements to create new console generations. He claims that such a model is subject to diminishing returns. He has been quoted as saying that ‚ÄúIf [Nintendo] had followed existing roadmaps we would have aimed to make [the Wii] faster and flashier. We‚Äôd have tried to improve the speed at which it displays stunning graphics. But we could not help but ask, ‚ÄòHow big an impact would that really have on our customers?‚Äô In development, we came to realize the sheer inefficiency of this path when we compared the hardships and costs of development against the new experiences customers might have.‚Äù Takeda began to have doubts about following this model as early as 2002. He claims to have figured out that consumers will not be satisfied with graphics at any point, that the new improvement effects will eventually wear off, and that ‚Äúthere is no end to the desire of those who just want more. Give them one, they ask for two. Give them two and the next time they will ask for five instead of three, their desire growing exponentially.‚Äù He has famously compared the console industry to the automobile industry. Noticing that not all cars are built to compete at the highest level of racing, he points out that there are lucrative markets for the most fuel- efficient, family-friendly vehicles as well. Takeda meant for the Wii to parallel this model, and has mentioned in an interview that one of his major technical goals on the Wii was to scale back the power necessary to operate the console while maintaining the same high performance. He compared the Wii to a hybrid vehicle for its mass appeal and conservation attributes.  Works  ; Producer * EVR Race * Sheriff (arcade game) * Space Firebird * Popeye (arcade game) * Punch-Out!!

Isaac Nathan (c. 179115 January 1864) was an English composer, musicologist, journalist and self- publicist, who topped off an eventful career by becoming the \\"father of Australian music\\". Early success Isaac Nathan was born around 1791 in the English city of Canterbury to a hazzan (Jewish cantor) born in Poland, Menahem Monash \\"Polack\\" (the Pole), and his English Jewish wife, Mary (Lewis) Goldsmid (1779‚Äì1842). He was initially destined for his father's career and went to the school of Solomon Lyon in Cambridge. Showing an enthusiasm for music, he was apprenticed to the London music publisher Domenico Corri. He also claimed to have had five years of voice lessons with Corri, who had studied with Nicola Porpora. In 1813 he conceived the idea of publishing settings of tunes from synagogue usage and persuaded Lord Byron to provide the words for these. The result was the poet's famous Hebrew Melodies. Nathan's setting of these remained in print for most of the century. The Hebrew Melodies used, for the most part, melodies from the synagogue service, though few if any of these were in fact handed down from the ancient service of the Temple in Jerusalem, as Nathan claimed. Many were European folk-tunes that had become absorbed into the synagogue service over the centuries with new texts (contrafacta). However they were the first attempt to set out the traditional music of the synagogue, with which Nathan was well acquainted through his upbringing, before the general public. To assist sales, Nathan recruited the famous Jewish singer John Braham to place his name on the title page, in return for a share of profits, although Braham in fact took no part in the creation of the Melodies. The success of the Melodies gave Nathan some fame and notoriety. Nathan was later to claim that he had been appointed as singing teacher to the Princess Royal, Princess Charlotte, and music librarian to the Prince Regent, later George IV. There is no evidence for this, although his edition of the Hebrew Melodies was dedicated to the Princess by royal permission.Conway (2012), 91‚Äì4 Decline In 1816, Byron left England, never to return (nor to communicate further with Nathan). In 1817 Nathan's royal pupil Princess Charlotte died in childbirth. He thus lost his two major patrons. Nathan undertook a runaway marriage with a music pupil, and another after his first wife's early death. Both spouses were Christian; however for both, Nathan also undertook and arranged synagogue marriages after the church ceremony. His hot temper probably accounts for a duel he fought over the honour of Lady Caroline Lamb, and his assault on an Irish nobleman who he thought had impugned one of his female pupils. The latter saw Nathan prosecuted, although he was acquitted. Nathan felt a special attachment for Lady Caroline; she was godmother to one of his children and he wrote her an appreciative poem in Hebrew, which he reprints in his Recollections of Lord Byron. Gambling on prize-fights was one cause of his financial problems. He may have spent at least some months in debtors' prisons. He wrote frequently for the popular press in London on boxing and music. He wrote comic operas for the London stage, and four of these were produced between 1823 and 1833. His copyright for Hebrew Melodies ought to have brought him income ‚Äì at one point he sold it to his married sister, presumably to avoid it being lost in bankruptcy ‚Äì but it became involved in complex legal disputes. He attempted a publishing business in partnership with his brother Barnett Nathan, who later became proprietor of Rosherville Gardens. Nathan published a history of music (1823), dedicated by permission to King George IV, which shows in its treatment of Jewish music a great deal of understanding of the Bible and of Jewish traditions.Conway (2012), 97 Nathan also attracted some renown as a singing teacher. One of his pupils was another great English poet, the very young Robert Browning, who 60 years later recalled: 'As for singing, the best master of four I have, more or less, practised with was Nathan, Author of the Hebrew Melodies; he retained certain traditional Jewish methods of developing the voice'.Quoted in Herbert Everith Greene, \\"Browning's Knowledge of Music\\" in Proceedings of the Modern Languages Institute, 62 (1947), 1098. Australian resurgence Nathan claimed to have undertaken some mysterious services for the Royal Family, but the Whig government under Lord Melbourne, Lady Caroline Lamb's husband, refused payment to him, leading to his financial embarrassment. He emigrated to Australia with his children, arriving in April 1841. There he became a leader of local musical life, acting as music adviser both to the synagogue and to the Roman Catholic cathedral in Sydney. He gave first or early performances in Australia of many of the works of Mozart and Beethoven.Conway (2012), 98‚Äì9 On 3 May 1847 his Don John of Austria, the first opera to be written, composed and produced in Australia, was performed at the Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney.Isaac Nathan, Byron, and Don John of Austria, p.14. Longer version of programme note for the Sydney Symphony Orchestra performances October 2007, at He was the first to research and transcribe indigenous Australian music, and also set lyrics by the poet Eliza Hamilton Dunlop.Eliza Hamilton Dunlop in the Australian Dictionary of Biography Death and descendants The London Jewish Chronicle of 25 March 1864 reported from Sydney: > Mr. Nathan was a passenger by No. 2 tramway car [‚Ä¶] [he] alighted from the > car at the southern end, but before he got clear of the rails the car moved > onwards [‚Ä¶] he was thus whirled round by the sudden motion of the carriage > and his body was brought under the front wheel. The horse-drawn tram was the first in Sydney: Nathan was Australia's (indeed the southern hemisphere's) first tram fatality. He was buried in Sydney; his tomb is at Camperdown Cemetery.Camperdown Cemetery Many of Nathan's descendants became leading Australian citizens. Later descendants include three brothers ‚Äì the conductor Sir Charles Mackerras; the psephologist Malcolm Mackerras; the headmaster of Sydney Grammar School Alastair Mackerras ‚Äì and their nephew, the conductor Alexander Briger. Summary Nathan's Hebrew Melodies was in print in England at least until the 1850s and was known across Europe. Moreover, Nathan can claim some credit as inspiring Byron's texts. These not only in themselves diffused a spirit of philosemitism in cultured circles (indeed they became perhaps Byron's most genuinely popular work); but they were used as the basis for settings by many other composers in the nineteenth century, both Jewish (Felix and Fanny Mendelssohn, Joachim) and gentile (Schumann, Loewe, Mussorgsky, Balakirev, and others). Nathan's writings on music had little direct influence, small sales, and received no serious reviews in the press. In isolation, he struck upon and highlighted a theme which was at the time a major concern of the Jewish intellectual movement in Germany; the delineation and promotion of a genuine Jewish culture. The same spirit seems to have motivated his pioneering work with the music of the indigenous Australians.Conway (2012), 100 Finally, Nathan's indomitable refusal to admit defeat in life in exile ‚Äì he undoubtedly paralleled himself with his hero Byron ‚Äì has enabled him, from his concertising and writings on Aboriginal music, to be justly remembered by antipodean musicologists as \\"the father of Australian music\\".

The coast is steep with vertical cliffs reaching down to the sea. Kaliakra is a nature reserve, where dolphins and cormorants can be observed. It sits on the Via Pontica, a major bird migration route from Africa into Eastern and Northern Europe. Many rare and migrant birds can be seen here in spring and autumn and, like much of this coastline, is home to several rare breeding birds (e.g. pied wheatear and a local race of European shag). The rest of the reserve also has unusual breeding birds; saker falcon, lesser grey shrike and a host of others. It also features the remnants of the fortified walls, water-main, baths and residence of Despot Dobrotitsa in the short-lived Principality of Karvuna's medieval capital. The Bolata Cove with a small sheltered beach lies just north at the mouth of a picturesque canyon, also part of the nature reserve. Name The following names have been used for the headland and the fortress throughout their history: * Thracian: Tirizis (Greek: Œ§ŒØœÅŒπŒ∂ŒπœÇ) , Akrai or Kalƒì Akra  Relic from medieval Bulgaria exhibited in Kaliakra museum. Kaliakra museum is working in a natural cave in the cliffs at Kaliakra. It exhibits items found on the spot there, at cape Kaliakra, Southern Dobruja. The name \\"Kaliakra\\" is of Byzantine Greek origin. It is a combination of \\"Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåœÇ\\" (\\"beautiful\\") and \\"Œ¨Œ∫œÅŒ±\\" (\\"headland\\" or \\"edge\\" or \\"extremity\\") and is traditionally translated as \\"Beautiful Headland\\". History Kaliakra was the site of the naval Battle of Cape Kaliakra on 11 August 1791, part of the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792). The first modern lighthouse on Kaliakra was built in 1866 by the Compagnie des Phares de l‚ÄôEmpire Ottoman; the present one, a cylindrical stone masonry tower with lantern and gallery, was erected in 1901, with focal plane height of and a white flash (every 5 seconds); it also has a radio navigation emitter and a foghorn. Near Kaliakra, there is a large mediumwave broadcasting facility, which never went into service as planned. As of 2009, several wind power facilities are under development in the vicinity. The area now has three championship golf courses designed by the legendary golfers Gary Player and Ian Woosnam.  Ancient fortress  = History = The earliest naval settlement dates back to the 4th century BC, when the area was inhabited by the Thracian tribe of Tiris and who gave the area its original name of Tirisis. The ancient geographer Strabo, describing Kaliakra, stated that the capital of King Lisimachus, one of Alexander's generals and ruler of Thrace, was located here. According to rumor, he hid in the caves near the peninsula his innumerable treasure, reputedly captured on the campaigns against Persia. In the Hellenistic era, a second fortress wall was built inland, and in Roman times the Thracian fortress was expanded. In the years 341‚Äì342, round towers were completed, and there was already a city built up around the fortress. In the second half of the 4th century, a third fortification with 10 m walls, 2.90 m thick, was erected even farther from the end of the peninsula. During the archeological excavations made in the 20th century, the remains of ancient and early Christian necropolises were discovered on Kaliakra. In the 5-6th century, according to Hierocele, the fortress (now known as Accra Castellium or simply Accra-cape) gained the importance of a fortified nucleus against the oncoming barbarian tribes and was one of the 15 cities in the province of Scythia. In 513, a battle ensued between Kaliakra and the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I. The settlement and fortress developed in the following centuries, but according to some researchers in the 7th century a decline occurred because the Slavs and Proto-Bulgarians showed no interest in settling this place. In 10th century sources, the area is variously listed as Tetrasida, Tetrasiada, Tetrisias, Trisa, Tirisa, or Tirista. The earliest dated Western European map that mentions the modern name Kaliakra is that of the Italian Petrus Vesconta, from 1318. In other Italian maps and 14th-century writings, the peninsula is also described as Capo Calacria or Calacria. The German armored bearer Hans Schiltberger describes the peninsula as Kalacerca, derived from the \\"Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåœÇ\\" ‚Äì beautiful / good and \\"œÑœÉŒ≠œÅŒ∫Œπ\\" ‚Äì a hoop, given the three walls of the Kaliakra fortress. The Bulgarian Navy of the First World War included a mine-clearing boat named \\"Kalatserka\\". The heyday of Kaliakra was in the second half of the 14th century when it was the capital of the principality (despotate) of Carvun under the Bulgarian rulers Balik and Dobrotitsa. The despotate covered the northeastern Bulgarian lands, and was detached from the central government. Dobrotica is also called Dobrudzha, which is the Turkish pronunciation of its name. Written records speak of a powerful, medieval town where the ruler cut his own coins and turned the fortress into a church center. Today there are remains of the fortress walls on the tip of the headlands; some of the water supply, baths and the residence of the prince are still preserved. Kaliakra's despots were the first of the native rulers to begin building a navy. Dobrotica's galleys participated in successful combat operations in the Black Sea. In 1393 - 1394 the Carvun principality became one of the last Bulgarian possessions to fall under Ottoman rule. In 1402, the Vlach voivode Mircea Stari took over the lands around Kaliakra, but later that year the area was again occupied by the Ottoman troops. In 1444, the knights of the Polish and Hungarian King Vladislav III Varnenczyk were stopped near Cape Kaliakra in their campaign against the Ottoman Empire. In the old Turkish lawmen, Kaliakra is mentioned as a port with a Kilagra or Celigra Burun customs. On July 31, 1791, the largest naval battle in the Black Sea began off the coast of Kaliakra during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787‚Äì1792. The Russian squadron, led by Admiral Fyodor Ushakov, repeatedly defeated Hussein Pasha's superior Turkish armada, and helped end the war. A plaque with a bas-relief of the Russian Admiral was erected on the headland's tip. On August 10, 2006, the 215th anniversary of this victory, a monument to him was erected. The monument is a figure in full height and is located on a hill, where it is visible from the sea. Legends Rock beach Probably the most popular legend about the place is one about 40 Bulgarian girls, who preferred to tie their hair together and jump into the Black Sea rather than face the prospect of being captured by the Ottomans. An obelisk dedicated to this legend is placed at the entrance to the cape, called The Gate of the 40 Maidens. Another legend tells the story of Saint Nicholas, the patron of seamen, who was running away from the Ottomans when God made the earth under him longer and longer so he could escape, and the cape was formed this way. The saint was eventually captured and a chapel was built in 1993, symbolizing his grave. A dervish monastery is also said to have existed on the same place during Ottoman rule, which is thought to have preserved the relics of Muslim Bektashi saint Sarƒ± Saltƒ±k. A third legend is about Lysimachus, a successor of Alexander the Great, who seized the royal treasure and escaped to Kaliakra, dying in a major storm along with his whole fleet. Climate Honour Kaliakra Glacier on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Kaliakra.

Kvaternik was the leader of the 1871 Rakovica Revolt which was an attempt to create an independent Croatian state, at the time when it was part of Austria- Hungary. In order to get foreign support for his cause Kvaternik visited the Russian Empire, France and the Kingdom of Sardinia. He was also well known for anti-Austro-Hungarian speeches that he made as member of Croatian Parliament. Early life Kvaternik was born in Zagreb. He was educated in Senj and in Pest. After the abolition of feudalism in 1848 by ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá, greater freedom from the Austrian Empire was granted. This encouraged proponents of Croatian independence such as Kvaternik. In 1857, the Austrian authorities forbade him to work as a lawyer, leaving him unemployed. Political and revolutionary activity In 1858 he decided to leave for the Russian Empire, seeking an ally against the Austrian state. Kvaternik was aware that Russia was aggrieved because Austria did not join the Crimea War. While in Russia, Kvaternik gained its citizenship, but soon realized that he would get no military help. In spring 1859 he left for Torino. With help from Niccol√≤ Tommaseo he met with various Italian statesmen and politicians. One of them was Italian prime minister Camillo Benso di Cavour and minister of justice Urbano Rattazzi. Kvaternik succeeded to arrange a meeting with them more easily because the Kingdom of Sardinia was just about to ally with Napoleon III of France to attack Austria. The Croatian Grenzers saved the Austrian Empire many times. Kvaternik promised that he would get loyalty of the Grenzers to help Cavour in his war against Austria. Kvaternik knew that the Grenzers were unhappy with the Austrian payments to them after the 1848 Hungarian Revolution. He issued an announcement in Croatian to the Grenzers not to help Austria in their war against the Italians. Kvaternik's announcement had a strong impact as the Grenzer were suffering from low morale while fighting in the Battle of Solferino. Austrians rushed to sign a peace with the French. Nevertheless, Kvaternik believed that the Grenzers would play a significant role in the liberation of Croatia. He continued negotiations with the Italian and Hungarian emigration and offered the Croatian crown to the Prince Napol√©on Joseph Charles, the Emperor's cousin and son-in-law of Italian King Victor Emmanuel II. After Napol√©on refused the crown, he offered it to a Polish noble W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czartoryski, who was a Catholic Slav. Kvaternik and his Italian and Hungarian allies made a plan to destroy Austria by instigating simultaneous revolts in both the Croatian Military Frontier and in Venice, while Giuseppe Garibaldi would land his troops in the northern Dalmatia. After that they counted on Hungarian and Romanian help with support of the Sardinian Kingdom and France. They also knew that Russia and Prussian Kingdom wouldn't offer any help to Austria. However, in 1865 the plan was withdrawn as Napoleon of France stopped to giving any help and thus forced Italy on inaction. In March 1860, Kvaternik claimed to Napoleon of France that Croatia could provide some 250,000 soldiers explaining that Croats were able to do so when they fought the Hungarians in the 1848 Revolution. A month later, he stated to the Sardinian ambassador (Signor Nigra) that Croats still hoped for revolution and could raise some 400,000 men and liberate Venice. Kvaternik was, however, more active during his stay in Italy between 1863-65. As a member of the Croatian Sabor beginning in 1861, Kvaternik become popular among those who disliked Austria, and at the same time he was still in contact with the Grenzers. In March 1864, he made a revolutionary plan, anticipating the creation of the Croatian People's Government and also started to publish a revolutionary newspaper in Geneva. In April 1864 he claimed to the Sardinian Foreign Ministry that Slavonia could provide some 300,000 men. The next month he claimed he could transfer the Granzers into \\"Free Italy\\" in order to help the revolt. Rakovica revolt =Political situation in Austria-Hungary= Minister-President of Cisleithania Count Karl Sigmund von Hohenwart After the dual monarchy was created in 1867, Germans and Hungarians become the most influential people in the monarchy, leaving Slavs, such as Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, Serbs and Slovenes, in an unprivileged position. The Prussian ambassador in Vienna, General Schweinitz, reported that the Czechs were trying to destroy the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy and that the Germans and Hungarians feared the monarchy would approach the Russian Empire for help. Hungarians were also aware that Emperor Franz Joseph was counting on Russian help to avenge his defeat at K√∂niggr√§tz from 1866. The Czech effort to crush the Monarchy were so strong that they overthrown the dualist government of Alfred Potocki. After Potocki's removal, Franz Joseph named Karl von Hohenwart new Minister-President of Cisleithania. Hohenwart advocated federalism and collapse of the dualist policy. The main opponents of Hohenwart's policy were Hungarian nationalists, namely Prime Minister of Hungary Gyula Andr√°ssy and his government. Franz Joseph had a plan to deal with the Hungarians once he solved the problem with the Czechs. Austria-Hungary entered a fierce political struggle. Hohenwarth was dealing with the Czechs, while Friedrich von Beust, the foreign minister and chairman of the joint government, dealt with Andr√°ssy. Hohenwarth, nevertheless, was successful at the beginning. In September 1871, the Emperor recognized the Czech Kingdom and promised to crown himself as its king in Prague. It was the first sign that dualist policy would collapse in favour of federalism. As Andr√°ssy was disappointed by this move, he forced von Beust to give a memorandum against Hohenwarth to the Emperor in October, however, the Emperor continued to give his thrust to Hohenwart. =Preparations for the Rakovica revolt= While in Torino in June 1864, Kvaternik met with Ante Rakija≈°, a former military cadet who had deserted. Rakija≈°, a Croatian nationalist educated in Graz, served as Kvaternik's main assistant. In November 1864 both of them planned a revolt that would occur in spring 1865. Rakija≈° obtained a fake passport and moved from Torino to Ancona, waiting for a chance to enter Dalmatia. In early 1865 he went to Braƒç, and from there to Split and later to Sinj, from where he went to Knin. In Knin, he tried to instigate an uprising. He failed and was arrested and sentenced to eleven months in prison in Zadar. Due to the arrest of Rakija≈°, Kvaternik realized that their plan for a revolt had failed, so he also returned to Croatia. But just as he arrived to Zagreb, he was soon forced to flee as he was a Russian citizen, and as such he was dangerous to the authorities. His expulsion was ordered by Ban Josip ≈†okƒçeviƒá, who hated him as well as members of the Party of Rights; ≈†okƒçeviƒá was advised to do so by Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer. Rakovica Deaths, painted by a Croatian painter Oton Ivekoviƒá After Austria was defeated by Prussia in the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz in 1866 and after Franz Joseph I of Austria was crowned as Hungarian king in 1867, Kvaternik got amnesty from the Austrian Emperor and approval for his return. Ban Levin Rauch also gave him Austrian citizenship and permitted him to work as a lawyer. As of then, Kvaternik worked as a lawyer and also dealt with history. He published his book \\"Eastern Question and the Croats\\" in two volumes. Kvaternik was also involved in publishing activities; between 1868-70 he wrote for the magazine Hrvat (The Croat). In 1871 he was publishing an official newspaper of the \\"Party of Rights Hrvatska\\". Meanwhile, Rakija≈° was released from prison and went to Zagreb where he closely cooperated with Kvaternik. Rakija≈° soon moved to Karlovac and was employed as a police officer with Kvaternik's help by captain Fabiani, a supporter of the Party of Rights. The Grenzers would be in Karlovac on every Friday, which Rakija≈° used to explain them the political situation. Croats were disappointed by creation of the dual monarchy in 1867, and with the Croatian-Hungarian Agreement in 1868, but were pleased with the unification of the Military Frontier with rest of Croatia. However, the people of the Military Frontier feared the Hungarian influence and higher taxes. =Revolt= Rakovica In May 1871, Kvaternik wasn't elected to the Sabor, so in October he abandoned his party's aim of only using political resistance and launched the Rakovica Revolt, just when the Austria-Hungary was in the process of federalization. Kvaternik believed that once he started the revolt, the unhappy Grenzers would join him. His goal was the liberation of Croatia and the unification of its lands. He planned to proclaim the Croatian People's Government after a projected meeting with the Granzers, after which he would arm the people from Slunj, Ogulin, and the Isle regiments and Rakovica. Then he planned to move towards Ogulin and Karlovac from where he would go to Zagreb where he would for a second time proclaim the liberation and to ask the European countries for their recognition and protection. He was bolstered by the fact that Austria-Hungary was isolated at the time, without no strong allies. In October 1871, Kvaternik left Zagreb and met with Rakija≈° in Karlovac and went with him to Broƒáanac, where he arrived on the evening on 7 October. The revolutionaries held a meeting in Broƒáanac and formed the transitional Croatian People's Government and Kvaternik was named president. Petar Vrdoljak was named minister of interior, Ante Rakija≈° was named minister of defence and Vjekoslav Bach, a lawyer from Zagreb, was named minister of finance. Rade ƒåuiƒá, another revolutionary, was named commander of the usta≈°e (uprising), a commander of the armed forces respectively, while Ante Turkalj was named prefect of the Ogulin region. The next day, Sunday, 8 October, Kvaternik launched the revolt. With some 200 Grenzers Kvaternik moved towards Rakovica with noted Croatian flag. He was accompanied by Bach. The building of their government supposed to be in house of a merchant, Ivo Vuƒçiƒá, a local from Rakovica. As they arrived they arrested those Grenzer who opposed to join them and took their arms. They started to organize the revolt. Nearby villages also joined them, including Broƒáanac, Brezovac, Ma≈°vina, Plavƒáa Draga and Moƒçila. Eugen Kvaternik Square in ƒåakovec The revolt, however, ended unsuccessfully and Kvaternik was killed while trying to break out of Austro-Hungarian Army's encirclement.http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=51706 Squares in Zagreb and ƒåakovec, the Eugen Kvaternik Squares, are named after him, as is a street in Osijek, Ulica Eugena Kvaternika. \\"I hate neither Hungary nor Austria and all that I do I do out of immense love of Croatia.\\" ‚Äì Eugen Kvaternik References ;Citations ;Bibliography * Further reading * 1825 births 1871 deaths People from Zagreb Representatives in the Croatian Parliament (1848‚Äì1918) Party of Rights politicians University of P√©cs alumni People executed by Austria-Hungary Croatian nationalists ","title":"Eugen Kvaternik"},{"id":"3518591","text":"Sex Traffic is a two-part British-Canadian television thriller, written by Abi Morgan and directed by David Yates, that first broadcast on Channel 4 on October 14, 2004. The series, produced by Veronica Castillo and Derek Wax, stars John Simm as Daniel Appleton, a journalist who uncovers a trafficking ring involving Anti-Trafficking officers employed by a private security company in the United States. As Daniel vows to help Elena (Anamaria Marinca), one of the trafficked girls, he attempts to expose the business which forces young women from Eastern Europe into a life of sexual slavery. The series was filmed between London, Bucharest and Nova Scotia. The series was also broadcast on CBC in Canada during October 2004. Notably, despite winning the BAFTA award for Best Actress, Sex Traffic was actress Anamaria Marinca's first credited television role. Overall, the series won a total of eight BAFTAs, including Best Drama Serial, and four Gemini Awards. The series was released on DVD on September 4, 2006. Reception Sex Traffic received critical acclaim across the board, with the British Film Institute's Screenonline writing; \\"As in his previous television work, including his adaptation of Anthony Trollope's The Way We Live Now which drew parallels between its ruthless Victorian entrepreneur hero and modern media tycoons, and the fine conspiracy thriller, State of Play, director David Yates gives a thrilling and complicated narrative a strong social and political dimension. The brutality of brothel life is tellingly juxtaposed with the ethics of Boston business, which is lavish with its charity while turning a knowingly blind eye to corruption. Sex Traffic is impeccably photographed, edited and scored.\\" The Daily Telegraph wrote, \\"Sex Traffic is brutally honest in its treatment of a distressing subject, but it's this very honesty that makes it such a vital drama. It does indeed go to the heart of the audience, and its dark images stay with you for a long, long time. Difficult viewing, yes, but essential.\\" Empire commented that Sex Traffic was a \\"courageous, shocking piece of work\\", while The Guardian called it \\"a gripping thriller\\".IFC Films John Simm commented, \\"Watching Sex Traffic is not a horrible experience, because it works well as a thriller, so it's exciting and you are always gunning for the good guys ‚Äì but you can't escape the fact that it's a depressing subject matter.\\" Plot The expulsion of Sergeant Callum Tate (Luke Kirby), an Anti- Trafficking officer working in Bosnia, sparks concern for multi-national private security company Kernwell, headed up by Tom Harlsburgh (Chris Potter). Having been caught seemingly trying to procure a prostitute for $2,000, Tate's actions have threatened to throw the entire company into disrepute, just as the directors are on the brink of signing an $8 million contract to provide private security in Iraq. Tate denies the allegations, claiming that he was trying to free Anya Petria (Alexandra Fasola), a student who had been trafficked from Romania and forced to work as a prostitute. Tate claims that a number of Kernwell officers, including Major James Brooke (Robert Joy) are involved in a trafficking ring involving the enslavement of young women seeking refuge from their own countries in the hope of finding a better life in the West. Kernwell order a press blackout, preventing Tate's suspension or any of the allegations made reaching the press. Meanwhile, Daniel Appleton (John Simm), a journalist working for London-based charity Speak For Freedom, travels to Bosnia to report on Kernwell's activities, and whilst there, he witnesses a number of Anti-Trafficking officers having sex with prostitutes at a local bar. But before he can report his findings, the bar is raided and information is spread to suggest that he was caught having sex with a prostitute, Elena Visinescu (Anamaria Marinca), at the time of the raid. Appleton refutes the allegations, but is ordered to cease investigation into Kernwell by his boss, Joan Stewart (Alison Peebles). Appleton decides to continue privately investigating Kernwell, and discovers that shortly after leaving Bosnia to head for Europe, Anya's body was found washed up on the shores of an Italian beach. After becoming separated from her sister, Elena heads for London to find Appleton. With Elena's help, Appleton sets out to expose the corrupt officers working for the Anti-Trafficking unit and bring Kernwell to book.

It chronicles the endless traveling, hotels, sound checks, performances and, notably, strips away the glittering facade of the rock star that the music industry PR machine would have music fans believe. Hunter delivers a distinctly British perspective as he encounters the diverse American cultural landscape. Already in his 30s and a show biz veteran, Hunter offers not only the usual clich√©s, but also mature, hard-won insights into the rock game. As if aware of his own future career arc, Hunter warns, \\"It may look flashy, but it's over and you are finished before you know it - if you aren't already broken by one thing it will be another... The rock business is a dirty business full stop.\\" (page 52, 1996 edition) With Mott the Hoople riding a Top 5 hit song (the David Bowie-penned \\"All The Young Dudes\\") and sharing Tony Defries' MainMan Management \\"family\\" with rising superstar David, Hunter offers an inside look at Bowie circa late 1972.

All of his children are artists. Two of them, Diego and Andrea, also work in comics, Diego as an artist, Andrea used to be a colorist & Guillermo who is an inker and illustrator. The three of them occasionally collaborated with Eduardo Barreto. Early life  Luis Eduardo Barreto Ferreyra was born in 1954 in Montevideo, Uruguay. From the Sayago neighborhood, his childhood and youth house was in Calaguala street; and he grew up reading comics and being an avid supporter of his favorite soccer team, Club Nacional de Football. In interviews, Barreto reminisced about the time when, at age seven, he was reading a comic and decided he would grow up to be a professional comic strip artist.  Career  =In Uruguay and Argentina= A self-taught artist, Barreto named Russ Manning, Hal Foster and Warren Tufts as his three main artistic influences. When he was 15 years old, his portfolio under his arm, he went to each and every newspaper in Montevideo looking for a job. With a Richard Lionheart biographical comic inspired by Foster's Prince Valiant, one of his favorite comics) as his strongest work and which he had intended to sell outside of Uruguay, he finally found a job at the newspaper El D√≠a. The editor for the newspaper's children's magazine (El D√≠a de los Ni√±os) liked Barreto's art, but he asked him to do something more Hispanic. Thus, an adaptation of the Spanish epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid (The Lay of the Cid), was soon published in the magazine, scripted and drawn by Barreto, aged 16. In 1974 he created a science fiction and space opera strip inspired by The Morning of the Magicians, a book by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier. He created the strip intending to sell it to a syndicate, as his first love in comics was strips, and called it El Poderoso Halc√≥n (The Mighty Hawk). In Uruguay, however, his only client was the newspaper magazine he was already working for, in which he published two pages featuring the character on Sundays. A year later, Barreto sold the strip to United Press International, and the syndicate distributed his strips to some sixteen or seventeen newspapers in Latin America. There was even talk of translating it into English, but it never happened, due to international paper and oil crisis in the mid-1970s. At age 21, Barreto was publishing a strip all across Latin America. Working outside Uruguay was a logical consequence of the career he had been forging for himself, a logical consequence of wanting to make a living in comics. Since making a full living from comics in Uruguay was impossible, he traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to leave some samples in publisher Editorial Columba (house of comic anthology magazines El Tony and Dartagnan). He returned to Montevideo, and supplemented his comic work for El D√≠a with artwork for advertising agencies. After getting married and moving, he returned to Buenos Aires on vacation, and visited Columba again. The publisher's chief art editor, Antonio Presa, asked him why he hadn't answered the letter in which they offered him a position working on the strip Kabul de Bengala. Barreto never had received the letter, as it had been sent to his former address. Starting in 1975, he worked for about three years for the Argentinian publisher, first living in the country for a year, working in the Nippur IV studio (which was named as the classic Argentinian historieta/character Nippur de Lagash). In the morning he worked in the Kabul art (scripted by H. G. Oesterheld), and in the afternoon he worked at the Nippur studio, as an assistant to Ricardo Villagr√°n; or rather a ghost artist. Among others, he worked on \\"Mark\\" (doing full pencils starting with issue seven). After that year he moved back to Uruguay, working there and traveling once a month to Argentina. By then he was working on several Nippur studio characters, but on his own, and signing his own name. Eventually, tired of Ray Collins' (Eugenio Zapietro) scripts, he signed his Kabul art with aliases, such as \\"S. Gneis\\" or \\"Kopy\\"; using the latter when he had to copy another artists' styles. =United States work= After three years working in Argentina, his editor advised him to try his luck in the United States. He had reached a certain ceiling in the regional market. In 1979 he went to New York City, and his first U.S. work was inking for Marvel Comics was Marvel Team-Up #88 (Dec. 1979) featuring Spider-Man and the Invisible Girl, with script by Chris Claremont and pencils by Sal Buscema. The same afternoon he got that assignment, he also received a Hawkman origin story for World's Finest Comics #261 from DC Comics, and a horror story from Western Publishing. After a few months he returned to Uruguay, but he would go back to the United States in 1983. He would live there for about three years, working first on the Archie Comics superhero imprint Red Circle, particularly in The Shield. Three or four months later, he started to work on Superman for DC, and on other things for Marvel and Western as well. He did most of his U.S. work for DC Comics and the Uruguay audience knew him as the \\"Uruguayan Batman artist\\", something that was only a partial look at his work. In addition to being the most well-known Uruguayan artist in international comics, he was also the only Uruguayan to draw a regular U.S. series continuously, and not as fill-in, guest artist. First he drew eight issues of Atari Force (October 1984 to August 1985) and then a very long run drawing of most of the issues from #13 (Oct. 1985) to #49 (Nov. 1988) of The New Teen Titans vol. 2. During those years, he worked for other comic publishers and drew for other media including a He-Man story book in 1985. During the 1980s, in addition to his Titans work, he drew stories, covers, and pin-ups featuring a wide variety of DC characters: Superman, Batman, Legion of Super-Heroes, Green Arrow, The Flash, and in licensed comics published by DC such as Star Trek. In 1989 he illustrated the prestige format graphic novel Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography, written by James D. Hudnall, in which Superman is practically absent, instead featuring Clark Kent in his investigative journalist role. In 1989 and 1990, Barreto drew The Shadow Strikes with writer Gerard Jones. The two also collaborated on Martian Manhunter: American Secrets (1992), a miniseries set in the 1950s. In the 1990s Barreto worked with several companies and characters, such as Dark Horse Comics, for whom he drew Indiana Jones, Aliens/Predator: Deadliest of the Species, and Star Wars: A New Hope ‚Äì The Special Edition. For DC Comics, his 1990s work included Superman: Speeding Bullets, Justice League Quarterly, Sgt. Rock, and others. He inked the first appearance of Agent Liberty in Superman vol. 2 #60 (Oct. 1991). His Superman: Under A Yellow Sun focused on Clark Kent's career as a novelist. For Tekno Comics he drew Mickey Spillane's Mike Danger, about a hard-boiled detective who finds himself in a futurist world. In the 2000s, he continued to work for various publishers, such as Claypool Comics, for whom he illustrated Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. For Oni Press he drew the western story The Long Haul, and the gangster graphic novel Union Station. For Marvel he drew Marvel Knights between July 2000 and September 2001, scripted by Chuck Dixon. He would also work for IDW Publishing on Cobb: Off the Leash and Doomed, and for Moonstone Books' Captain Action the latter two written by Beau Smith. In 2005, for Dark Horse, he drew novelist Michael Chabon's first extended comic book story, in The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist #7, and later contributed to the series The Escapists written by Brian K. Vaughan. He worked on DC's Birds of Prey in 2004 and 2006. In 2006 he drew for Boom! Studios' Planetary Brigade, and the following year he did a short story for Marvel's Civil War: Front Line. In May 2006 he returned to newspaper strips, taking over as artist of Judge Parker from Harold LeDoux. Shortly afterwards, Barreto suffered a serious car accident, and while he was in the hospital, Judge Parker's art was undertaken by artists such as Graham Nolan, John Heebing, and Eduardo Barreto's son Diego, who had been working as an artist for a few years already, mainly in advertising but doing some work for U.S. comic publishers. =Return to Uruguayan work= After his jump to the U.S. scene, Barreto did very little work for the Uruguayan market. Among the things he worked on in his country were comic stories for the book Historiet@s.uy (2000) and Freeway magazine; and the cover for Jaime Roos's album \\"Hermano Te Estoy Hablando\\" (2009). He taught comic book classes in ORT university, and was part of the jury in one of the comic contests for Montevideo Comics, a local convention. In 2004 he illustrated a science fiction prose novel, Guide To A Universe, by writer Natalia Mardero; and in 2005 Memories Of A Flu, a children's novel by writer Helen Velando. Among other works scripted by himself, around 2009 he was working on a new adaptation of the book Ismael, by Uruguayan writer Eduardo Acevedo D√≠az, and a historical graphic novel set in Colonia del Sacramento, during Viceroy Pedro de Cevallos time. These works were never finished. = Final years = Barreto eventually returned to Judge Parker, and continued working on that and occasional stories with other characters, such as Superman and Captain Action. In 2010 he was stricken with meningitis, and was forced to abandon the Judge Parker daily strip in March 2010, which was taken over by Mike Manley. Sometime later, apparently recovered from meningitis, he set to work on other projects. In April 2011 it was announced that Eduardo Barreto and his son Diego would work on Irredeemable, and in July 2011 he took over the art for The Phantom's Sunday strips. His last published work was in DC Retroactive: Superman - The '70s (Sept. 2011), finished from his hospital bed, and with some pages drawn by fellow Uruguayan Christian Duce.DC Retroactive: Superman - The '70s #1 at the Grand Comics Database Barreto died on December 15, 2011. Before his death, Barreto drew Vampire Wedding commissioned by Robert Huttinger and Francesca Lombardo, founders of Castalides Pictures, a London- based film production company producing Vampire Wedding, the comic book and the TV series.

It was in the time of the Civil War and he was arrested by Roundhead soldiers only a few months later, on 2 July 1644, at Redgate Head, Wolsingham, County Durham, while on his way to baptize two children. Taken to Sunderland, he was examined by a Parliamentary Committee of sequestrators and placed in irons. He admitted he was a priest and so was taken to London with the Jesuit Ralph Corby, arrested about the same time near Newcastle-on-Tyne. They were both confined in Newgate, where they were the cause of crowds of Catholics gathering. On these and on others who encountered them they made an impression by their cheerfulness and sanctity. He was brought to trial on 4 September and given the inevitable sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering. Corby was offered a reprieve, but deferred in favour of the younger Duckett, who refused to walk away and leave his friend. Both were executed at Tyburn in London on 7 September 1644.\\"St John Duckett\\", Independent Catholic News Both priests were declared Blessed by Pope Pius XI on 15 December 1929.

The Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (), often called simply the Cymmrodorion, is a London-based Welsh learned society, with membership open to all. It was first established in 1751 as a social, cultural, literary and philanthropic institution. It fell into abeyance between 1787 and 1820, and again between 1843 and 1873. In its second and third incarnations its interests have been predominantly cultural and antiquarian. The present society claims continuity from that founded in 1751, although the three successive societies have in fact been slightly different in character and aims. The society continues to be based in London, but now draws two-thirds of its membership from Wales. History =First Society, 1751‚Äì1787= The Society was founded by the brothers Lewis and Richard Morris, natives of Anglesey. The name, coined by Lewis Morris, was a form of the (\\"earliest natives\\"), in reference to the place of the Welsh as heirs to the ancient Britons. Welsh Charity School on Clerkenwell Green (now the Marx Memorial Library) Several factors combined to prompt the foundation of the new society. One may have been Lewis Morris's disappointment at his failure to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. More important was a desire to support the Welsh Charity School, established in 1716 under the auspices of another London Welsh Society, the Honourable and Loyal Society of Antient Britons. By the 1740s the Antient Britons had become somewhat moribund, and the new Society of Cymmrodorion was intended in part to supplement its efforts. It was also to raise funds to relieve impoverished Welsh people in London. The Society's primary object, however, was to be a hub of social activity for the Welsh in London, and (in the absence of a recognised political or cultural \\"capital\\" of Wales) a focus of Welsh culture. Regular meetings were held on the first Wednesday of each month, when papers were read on a variety of literary and learned topics. Richard Morris served as the Society's first Llywydd (\\"President\\"). On his death in 1779, the Society offered a silver medal for the best elegy on its late President, a competition which can be seen as a forerunner of the National Eisteddfod of Wales. Sir Watkin Lewes succeeded Morris as Llywydd, and served until the first Society's demise in 1787. The Society had also a Penllywydd (\\"Chief President\\"). This office was held by William Vaughan of Corsygedol until shortly before his death in 1775, and then by Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet, of Wynnstay. In the second half of the 18th century the Welsh Charity School was run jointly by the Antient Britons and the Cymmrodorion. The officers of the Cymmrodorion used the school building on Clerkenwell Green as their business address, sometimes held meetings there, and used one of its rooms as a library. The library was intended to hold a copy \\"of every Book that hath ever been printed in the antient British language\\", as well as manuscripts. It was, in other words, regarded as a prototype National Library of Wales. A regular and important activity in the Society's calendar (though primarily the responsibility of the Antient Britons) was the annual Saint David's Day dinner, held to raise funds to support the school. The Cymmrodorion helped to fund a case in ecclesiastical law in which the churchwardens and parishioners of a Welsh-speaking benefice in Anglesey challenged the appointment to their benefice of a monoglot English priest who was unable to minister in Welsh. In 1766 John Egerton, Bishop of Bangor, appointed an elderly English priest, Dr Thomas Bowles, to the parish of St Beuno, Trefdraeth and chapelry of St Cwyfan, Llangwyfan. The Court of Arches heard evidence in the case in May 1770 but did not hear the prosecution and defence arguments until January 1773. Judging the case, the Dean of Arches, George Hay, agreed with the defence that the prosecution would have to prove Bowles was totally incapable of speaking any Welsh at all, and even if they did so Bowles had lawfully been granted the ecclesiastical freehold and therefore could not be deprived of it. However, he also agreed with the prosecution that only clergy who could speak Welsh should be appointed to Welsh-speaking parishes. Therefore, although Hay let Bowles stay in post, the case established the principle that clergy being considered for Welsh-speaking parishes should be examined in their knowledge of Welsh and only those proficient in the language should be inducted to them. Richard Morris died in 1779 and the Society fell into abeyance in 1787. In a symbolic gesture, its Presidential Chair was handed over to the Gwyneddigion Society (another London-based Welsh cultural society, founded in 1770). However, the Charity School, which in 1772 had moved to new premises in Gray's Inn Lane, continued to flourish. =Second Society, 1820‚Äì1843= The Society's revival in 1820 was linked to attempts in Wales to establish a National Eisteddfod under the auspices of four provincial Cambrian Societies (for Dyfed, Gwynedd, Gwent and Powys), and the perceived need for a central organisation to oversee their activities. Its formal title was therefore the Cymmrodorion Society or the Metropolitan Cambrian Institution. Those active in the revival included John Jenkins, Walter Davies, W. J. Rees and Richard Edmunds. The Society's Presidents included Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet (son of the second Chief President of the first society) and the 2nd Earl of Powis. Others officers included John Parry (\\"Bardd Alaw\\") as Registrar of Music, Henry Davies as Librarian, and John Jones (\\"Ioan Tegid\\") as \\"Welsh Correspondent\\". The Society published Welsh texts, awarded medals, and otherwise supported Welsh culture. Tensions and differences of opinion developed, however, between the Cymmrodorion Society and the four Cambrian Societies, over their financial relationships, over principles of Welsh spelling, and over whether the eisteddfodau should be predominantly literary or musical events. The Society seems to have been wound up in 1843. Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 6th Baronet, first President of the third Society =Third Society, 1873‚Äìpresent= The Society was revived for a second time in 1873, on the initiative of, among others, Hugh Owen, Henry Brinley Richards, and John Griffith (\\"Y Gohebydd\\"). Robert Jones of Rotherhithe subsequently also became a leading figure in its activities. Following in what was now a family tradition, Sir Watkin Williams- Wynn, 6th Baronet was made the first President. The Society was prominent in the successful establishment of an annual National Eisteddfod of Wales, beginning in 1861; and took part in discussions that led to the establishment of University College Wales, Aberystwyth in 1872, and the National Museum and National Library of Wales in 1907. It published ' in 1953, and its English language counterpart, the Dictionary of Welsh Biography in 1959, as well as several supplements. Activities The Society has its own publications, and holds lectures, all of which concern the native culture, language and literature of the Welsh. It formerly published the journal Y Cymmrodor (1823‚Äì43, 1877‚Äì1951), and a Record Series (13 volumes in 23 parts, 1892‚Äì1936). Its present journal is the Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, which has been published regularly since 1897; and it also publishes other occasional volumes relating to historical sources. The journals are being digitised by the Welsh Journals Online project at the National Library of Wales. The Society continues to be London-based but it also holds a number of meetings in Wales. A special lecture in Welsh is held each year at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, known as the Sir T. H. Parry- Williams Memorial Lecture, after the poet, author and academic who died in 1975. Ideology The first society's motto was \\"Undeb a Brawdgarwch\\" (\\"Unity and Fraternity\\"). Reflecting the changing roles of the later incarnations, the motto of the second and third societies has been \\"Cared Doeth yr Encilion\\" (\\"Let the Wise Cherish Antiquity\\"). The Society has always been notably nondenominational and apolitical, which means it has had more in common with its counterparts in Scotland than with those in Ireland. Address The Society's postal address is 157‚Äì63 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1X 8UE, the premises of the London Welsh Centre. Cultural references Thomas Pennant's British Zoology was published in 1766 \\"under the auspices of the Cymmrodorion Society\\", and was \\"sold for the benefit of the British Charity-School on Clerkenwell Green\\". In fact the publication lost money, and so the school derived no direct benefit from it. Pennant did, however, independently give a donation of ¬£100. The Society is mentioned by Robert Graves in his autobiography, Good-Bye to All That (1929). He attended a meeting organised by the Cymmrodorion in April 1916, while on leave from the Western Front, to hear W. M. Hughes, then Prime Minister of Australia, and David Lloyd George, then Secretary of State for War, speak. Of Lloyd George he wrote: \\"The power of his rhetoric amazed me.\\" References Bibliography  External links * 1751 establishments in England Celtic language advocacy organizations Learned societies of the United Kingdom Cultural organisations based in London Organizations established in 1751 Text publication societies Welsh culture Welsh diaspora in Europe Welsh language Welsh literature Magazines published in Wales ","title":"Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion"},{"id":"3518817","text":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Comic Book was a twelve-issue comic book series published in 1991‚Äì1992 and based on the Bill & Ted franchise. The series was nominated for a 1992 Eisner Award in the category of Best Humor Comic. Plot The first two issues revolve around the efforts of Bill (Bill S. Preston, Esq.) and Ted (Theodore Logan) as they plan a party to celebrate their recent nuptials. Unfortunately the personification of mortality, Death, a more recent ally, becomes vastly out of sorts and steals the phone-booth time machine. Rufus, their old guide, helps by directing them to a prototype for the phone booth/time machine. Bill and Ted must take the device and find Death before he causes too much damage to the time stream. The two also must deal with jealous rivals, who do not accept that Bill and Ted's wives had freely chosen to marry. Development It was written and illustrated by Evan Dorkin. The story continued from the end of the second film, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, which Dorkin had also adapted for Marvel Comics. As of a 2015 interview, Dorkin still has not seen the original movie. Reprints In 2005, Slave Labor Graphics reprinted the series in two trade paperbacks. While the reprints did include the Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey adaptation, the eighth issue of the regular series was skipped due to the fact that Dorkin did not write or illustrate the issue.

As of 2008, the Bolivian Navy had approximately 5,000 personnel. Although Bolivia has been landlocked since the War of the Pacific and its 1904 peace treaty, Bolivia established a River and Lake Force (Fuerza Fluvial y Lacustre) in January 1963 under the Ministry of National Defense. It consisted of four boats supplied from the United States and 1,800 personnel recruited largely from the Bolivian Army. The Bolivian Navy was renamed the Bolivian Naval Force (Fuerza Naval Boliviana) in January 1966, but it has since been called the Bolivian Navy (Armada Boliviana) as well. It became a separate branch of the armed forces in 1963. Bolivia has large rivers which are tributaries to the Amazon which are patrolled to prevent smuggling and drug trafficking. Bolivia also maintains a naval presence on Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world, across which runs the Peruvian frontier. Landlocked Bolivia has not reconciled with the loss of its coast to Chile and the Navy exists to keep the hope alive of recovering its coast by cultivating a maritime consciousness.Bolivia's Morales to take Chile sea dispute to court - BBC News, 24 Mar 2011. \\"The demand for the return of its lost coastline is the subject of powerful national sentiment in Bolivia. The landlocked Andean nation maintains a small navy, and schoolchildren are taught that regaining access to the sea is a patriotic duty.\\" The Bolivian Navy takes part in many parades and government functions, but none more so than the D√≠a Del Mar (Day of the Sea) in which Bolivia, every year, re-vindicates its claim for an unspecified sovereign access to the sea. Bolivia claims the country had access to the sea at independence in 1825. In the Boundary Treaty of 1866 between Chile and Bolivia the involved parties agreed on a border line that established a sea access for Bolivia recognized by Chile. In the War of the Pacific (1879-1883) Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia and conquered the Litoral Department, Bolivian coastal territories. The recovery of its coastline is a matter of honor in Bolivia, influencing many modern-day political actions and trade decisions. In 2010, Peru granted Bolivia \\"dock facilities, a free-trade zone and space for economic activities\\" along with the option to \\"build a Pacific Coast annex for the Bolivian navy school\\" in a 99-year deal. Organization The Navy is organized into ten naval districts with flotilla headquarters in Guaqui, Guayaramer√≠n, Puerto Su√°rez, Riberalta, and San Pedro de Tiquina and bases in Puerto Busch, Puerto Horquilla, Puerto Villarroel, Trinidad, and Rurrenabaque. Naval vessels include several dozen boats, a dozen or more of which are for riverine patrol. Seagoing vessels, including the American-made PR-51 Santa Cruz de la Sierra and several other vessels sail the oceans with the Bolivian flag with the granted permission of the \\"Capitanias Navales\\" Naval Registration Office. The Libertador Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, a ship acquired from Venezuela, used to sail from its home port in Rosario, Argentina on the River Paran√°. In 1993 the Navy was formally renamed the Naval Force (Fuerza Naval) and moved with the Bolivian Army under a single military authority. Most of the officers attend the Bolivian Naval Academy, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Military and Naval Science, accredited by the Military University. Many naval officers later go on to further studies at the undergraduate and graduate level. Argentina's Naval Military Group in Bolivia advises on naval strategy and tactics. Many Bolivian officers train in ocean sailing on Argentinian seagoing naval ships. The Force has several Special Operations units to address both internal and external threats. The Naval Force covers the extensive Bolivian inland waterways divided between the following Naval Districts which are named after the basin or region where they operate: **DN1 First Naval District \\"BENI\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (DN1 Primer Distrito Naval \\"BENI\\") **DN2 Second Naval District \\"MAMORA\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (DN2 Segundo Distrito Naval- \\"MAMORE\\") **DN3 Third Naval District \\"MADERA\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (DN3 Tercer Distrito Naval \\"MADERA\\") **DN4 Fourth Naval District \\"TITICACA\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (DN4 Cuarto Distrito Naval \\"TITICACA\\") **DN5 Fifth Naval District \\"SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (DN5 Quinto Distrito Naval \\"SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA\\") **Sixth Naval District DN6 \\"COBIJA\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (DN6 Sexto Distrito Naval \\"COBIJA\\") Bolivian marines marching in Cochabamba. **The Naval Service Areas: ***AN 1 \\"COCHABAMBA\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (AN 1 \\"COCHABAMBA\\") ***AN 2 \\"SANTA CRUZ\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (AN 2 \\"SANTA CRUZ\\") ***AN 3 \\"BERMEJO\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (AN 3 \\"BERMEJO\\") ***AN 4 \\"LA PAZ\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (AN 4 \\"LA PAZ\\") ** Special Operation capable units: ***Task Force \\"Blue Devils\\" ‚Äî‚Äî (Fuerza de Tarea \\"Diablos Azules) ***SINDA Naval Intelligence Service of the Bolivian Navy ‚Äî‚Äî (Servicio de Inteligencia Naval) ***Immediate Response Group GRIN ‚Äî‚Äî (Grupo de Reacci√≥n Inmediata GRIN) ***The High Altitude Diving Training Center ‚Äî‚Äî (El Centro de Instrucci√≥n de Buceo en Altura) ***Command Training Center Amphibians =Marine Corps = Bolivian naval infantry on top of inflatable boats.

He was a member of the Stooges, and of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, in which he sang harmony vocals and played guitar, bass, keyboards, and harmonica. Musical career Raised in Medford, Oregon, Thurston started out as a session musician. He has played with Jackson Browne (1986 to 1998), The Cult (1991), Melissa Etheridge, Glenn Frey, Hokus Pokus, Iggy And The Stooges (as part of the band from 1973 to 1974, and recordings with Iggy Pop in 1975, 1977 and 1979), Jump (1971; organ & lead vocals), Nils Lofgren, The Motels, Ron Asheton's The New Order, Bonnie Raitt, and John Trudell. Thurston later became a professional songwriter, penning tunes for (and sometimes with) Jackson Browne, Iggy Pop, and The Motels. James Williamson of Iggy and the Stooges has said, \\"I was over at Capitol Records and as I was going out I was watching this guy recording and it was Scott Thurston with this other band. He was cool, I could hear that he was a great piano player, so I got his contact info and I said, 'You wanna play with us?' When we put the band Iggy and the Stooges back together, I asked him if he wanted to play with us, and he said, 'Sure,' and the rest is history.\\" Williamson went on to say that he did not play much on Iggy Pop's New Values album: \\"Actually, I only played guitar on a couple of things. Scott played almost all the guitar. He's a very talented guy. He's a very good guitar player and a very good keyboard guy. He's just a very good musician.\\" In 1982 Thurston joined The Motels and played on their 1983 album Little Robbers. Prior to that he was also a member of the Chas Sandford Group. Thurston joined Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for their Full Moon Fever tour in 1989, which turned into a permanent spot for Thurston in the band's lineup. Thurston played rhythm guitar, keyboards, harmonica, and sang backing vocals.

It is located on a hill above the Naia Valley and the river of the same name, facing the Monti Martani mountain range. It also sits between two hot springs, the Amerino and the Furapane. History The name's origin is traditionally connected to the Roman toponym of Aquas Partas (\\"divided waters\\" or \\"between the waters\\"), about which, however, no documentation exists. More probably, the name born from the presence of several different water sources in the area. During the ancient Roman domination the area was a retreat - a spa whose mineralized hot water baths were easily accessible from Rome along the west branch of the via Flaminia. Thermal baths remain open to the public today. The city was later part of the Terre Arnolfe, and was later subjected to Todi. Subsequently, in 1588, it became a fief of the Cesi family. Main sights Its historical center at once was surrounded by medieval walls but, now mostly torn down, leaving only short stretches and a few cylindrical towers that at one time served as part of the town's defenses. Inside the old part of town, which is quiet and unprepossessing, the principal building of note is the Renaissance style Palazzo Cesi, started in 1564 and completed in 1579 by the architect Giovanni Domenico Bianchi. The Palazzo is owned by the University of Perugia and is in very poor, but improving, condition. The main portal includes some fine ashlar work and its interior features impressive carved wooden ceilings. It also possesses a capacious and delightful courtyard. Next to the Palazzo is a loggia with some remnants of Roman foundations. At once, the Palazzo's proprietor, Federico Cesi, housed the scientifically oriented Accademia dei Lincei here, attracting such teachers as Galileo Galilei. Today the Cesi's palazzo a small museum with a number of ancient artefacts, including Roman stone work from nearby Carsulae. The facility is also used for meetings and traveling exhibitions. Acquasparta is home to a number of churches, including San Francesco, built in 1290, essentially Romanesque but with a Gothic architecture facade, and the Church of the Madonna of the Cross, dating to 1606. The Church of the Sacred Sacrament, incorporating a Roman Mosaic in its floor, is a very good example of 17th century church architecture. Santa Cecilia, built in the 16th century, contains an elegant chapel in which lies the tomb of Federico Cesi. The surrounding countryside is charming in the Umbrian way, spotted with a few small castles such as the one at Configni. Of note a short way from Acquasparta is the church of San Giovanni de Butris, which was built on the remains of a Roman bridge, and incorporates very large Roman stone blocks. Also, along the via Flaminia, going north, is the ruins of another Roman bridge, the Ponte Fonnaia.

(Adams soon gave this work a companion, his Phrygian Gates, finished the next year. The latter is the longer of the two and uses similar techniques, but in terms of structure the pair have little in common.) China Gates is one of Adams' first mature works, which he wrote for the then 17-year-old pianist Sarah Cahill during a rainy season in northern California. Adams himself has suggested that the constant eighth notes of the piece reflect the steady rainfall of the time. The bass notes of the piece form the root of the mode, while the upper voices oscillate between different modes. K. Robert Schwarz has noted how the style of China Gates is in keeping with the ideas of \\"process music\\" of Steve Reich. The piece has a duration of about 4:50 minutes and is written in three parts. In the first part, the modes alternate between A-flat mixolydian and G-sharp aeolian, which sound almost like the major and minor versions of the same key. The third part alternates between F lydian and F locrian. The second part alternates more rapidly between all four modes. Adams has described the structure of the work as an \\"almost perfect palindrome\\".

Much of her focus in the latter part of her life was on the work of the 17th-century astrologer William Lilly. Biography In 1980, Barclay obtained an original copy of Lilly's Christian Astrology, and later she arranged to have it re-printed as a facsimile edition in 1985. This dissemination of Christian Astrology helped to spur a revival of interest in traditional astrology in the late 20th century.Holden, James Herschel. A History of Horoscopic Astrology, American Federation of Astrologers, Tempe, AZ (1996) p. 201 Her work stimulated the unearthing of techniques that had been lost in various cultural transitions since the Enlightenment and encouraged wider researches into the astrological traditions of the Babylonians, Greeks, Egyptians, Persians, Arabs, Western medieval and Renaissance practitioners. As part of her work as a professional astrologer, Barclay taught horary astrology, and she founded the Qualified Horary Practitioner (\\"QHP\\") correspondence course. This consisted of twelve lessons, the last of which required students to make a successful prediction using horary astrology. Several graduates of her course went on to make prominent careers for themselves in the field. Barclay wrote Horary Astrology Rediscovered (published in 1990), which is a detailed description of the theory, practice and history of horary astrology. The book included material from her correspondence course and in 1991 received the Professional Astrologers Inc. Award for her 'outstanding contribution to astrology'.Miller, Martin.ed. The Best of British Women, Bath Press (1993) p. 254 According to James Holden, in her book, she \\"advocates the use of Regiomontanus houses, apparently reasoning that if they were good enough for Lilly, they are good enough for 20th century horary astrologers.\\" Barclay's advocacy of Lilly also brought about an elevation of horary astrology (which is the main focus of Christian Astrology) from obscure occultism to mainstream astrological practice.

The dens are the winter home of tens of thousands of red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis). These pits are the largest known concentration in the world of this particular type of snake. Their winter dens are caverns formed by the area's water-worn limestone bedrock. In the spring, they come up from their dens to the snake pits, where they mate, then they disperse into the nearby marshes for the summer.  Conservation  221x221px The population of red-sided garter snakes around Narcisse was roughly 70,000 until terrible weather in 1999 killed tens of thousands of them before they could reach their winter dens. This tragedy triggered concern about the snakes' biannual migratory path, which cuts right across Highway 17. Every year, 10,000 snakes trying to get to or from their winter dens had been crushed under the wheels of vehicles. This had not been a problem before, because the vast population compensated for the losses. After the winter of 1999, however, the population of garter snakes was dangerously low, causing Manitoba Hydro and volunteers to intervene. Foot-high snow fences were built to force snakes into six-inch (15-cm) tunnels that went under Highway 17. Since some snakes still managed to squeeze under the fence and onto the road, signs were put up during the migratory season urging motorists to slow down to avoid accidentally driving over snakes. These measures worked, and now fewer than 1000 snakes per season are killed on the highway.  Visiting  The conservation area is open to the public. The snakes are most active during the spring and fall, in late April to early May, which is the mating season, and also in early September, when the snakes slither back down to their winter dens.https://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/wildlife/spmon/narsnakes/  See also  * Rae Bridgman (author of The MiddleGate Books, which feature the snakes of Narcisse, Manitoba) References  External links  * The Snakes of Narcisse  Wildlife and Ecosystem Protection (Province of Manitoba) * Snakes Alive!

The Wing provides all base-level support activities to the Academy. These activities include security, civil engineer, communications, logistics, military and civilian personnel, financial management, services, command post, chaplaincy, equal opportunity and the hospital, all of which support nearly 4,000 cadets and a total military community of approximately 20,000 personnel. The Wing's history dates to a celebrated World War II photographic reconnaissance group. The 10th Tactical Fighter Wing was stationed in France, West Germany, and England for over 40 years during the Cold War. During its USAFE service, the wing received seven Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards and deployed personnel and equipment to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia and fought during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. History : See 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Group and RAF Alconbury for complete lineage and history :Section source: 10th ABW History = 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing = Wing RB-66B and B-57A at Spangdahlem AB, 1957 The wing was first organized as the 10th Reconnaissance Wing on 3 December 1947, at Pope Field, North Carolina as part of the experimental wing base reorganization, an Army Air Forces reorganization which assigned its operational groups and support organization to a single wing. The 10th Reconnaissance Group was the new wing's operational flying component. On 25 August 1948, the reorganization was made permanent and the wing became the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (10 TRW). The 10th conducted training at Pope, primarily with army units at Fort Bragg President Truman's reduced 1949 defense budget required reductions in the number groups in the Air Force to 48, and the 10th was inactivated on 1 April 1949.Knaack, p. 25 On 10 July 1952 as a result of the United States Cold War military buildup in Europe, the 10 TRW was reactivated and assigned to NATO at Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France, absorbing the mission and equipment of the inactivating federalized 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. RF-4C Phantom of the 1st TRS, 1971 However, the base was not yet ready for jet aircraft, so only the 10th TRW Wing Headquarters was sent to Toul. The propeller-driven RB-26s of the former 112th TRS were absorbed by the 1st TRS at Toul, while the two RF-80A squadrons assigned to the 32d and 38th TRS were located at Neubiberg and F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Bases near Munich, West Germany. Ongoing construction delays in France forced the wing's transfer on 9 May 1953 to the newly completed Spangdahlem Air Base in West Germany where all the squadrons of the wing were united. The Republic RF-84F Thunderflash began to arrive in the fall of 1955, and the RF-80As were returned to the United States for Air National Guard use. Martin RB-57A Canberras replaced the World War II vintage RB-26s in 1954 to perform night reconnaissance missions. However, engine malfunctions, structural deficiencies and lack of supporting equipment and parts plagued the RB-57A, and the wing soon began to replace them with RB-66s.Knaack, p. 315 In 1956, the 10th TRW began to transition to the RB-66 and WB-66 Destroyers, and the RF-84Fs were transferred to the 66th TRW at Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base, France. Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs of the 527th TFTAS, 1977 In 1959, France placed new limits on the type of American forces stationed on its soil. Specifically, USAF nuclear-capable aircraft were to be removed from French bases. To accommodate the French restrictions, USAFE moved the 49th TFW from Etain-Rouvres Air Base to Spangdahlem and the 10th TRW was relocated to RAF Alconbury on 20 July 1959. With its headquarters at RAF Alconbury, the 10 TRW operated its B-66 Destroyers from RAFs Alconbury, RAF Bruntingthorpe, and RAF Chelveston. In addition, the 10th TRW frequently rotated its aircraft to Toul AB, France establishing a detachment there until France's withdrawal from NATO's integrated military in 1965. On 10 March 1964, a wing RB-66B took off from Toul for a mission over West Germany. Because of an equipment malfunction that was undetected by the crew, the plane continued its flight to East Germany and was shot down. The crew ejected safely, but was taken prisoner, although they were released before the end of the month. This incident prompted USAFE to institute a buffer zone, where special procedures were required for aircraft flying near the eastern border of West Germany.Knaack, p. 430 In 1965, the 10 TRW received a new airplane, the RF-4C Phantom II. The wing's mission changed slightly in 1976. It inactivated two of its three RF-4C squadrons. The 527th Tactical Fighter Training Aggressor Squadron, flying F-5E \\"Tiger IIs\\", activated at RAF Alconbury 1 April 1976, bringing a new mission to the wing. The squadron provided combat training to North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces by teaching and demonstrating soviet air tactics-under the title of Dissimilar Air Combat Tactics. The 527th flew the first \\"Aggressor\\" sortie from RAF Alconbury in May. = 10th Tactical Fighter Wing = 10th TFW Commander's A-10A Thunderbolt II, 1990 In the late 1980s, the 10 TRW experienced more dramatic changes. After 34 years with the same mission, the 10 TRW received a new one. This 1st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron inactivated in June 1987 and its RF-4Cs left the base. On 20 August 1987, the wing was designated as the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing. During 1988, two squadrons of A-10A Thunderbolt IIs, the 509th and 511th Tactical Fighter Squadrons, arrived from RAF Bentwaters/Woodbridge. As the A-10s arrived, the 527th Aggressor Squadron moved to RAF Bentwaters. Both A-10 flying squadrons, kept a strong close air support vigilance and remained ready to perform their mission in a contingency situation. The 511 TFS deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operations DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM from December 1990 to June 1991. The wing's A-10s played an important part in the air phase of the Gulf War, attacking tanks, Scud missiles, and other ground positions. = 10th Air Base Wing = The 10 TFW again went through dramatic changes in the early 1990s. The wing drew down its A-10 mission, September 1991 ‚Äì March 1992. Without its aircraft, the 10 TFW's mission became installation and community support for U.S. personnel at Alconbury and beyond. The wing was finally redesignated as the 10th Air Base Wing in March 1993, and inactivated October 1994. The 10th Air Base Wing was reactivated on 1 November 1994 as the support wing for the United States Air Force Academy, Colorado.
