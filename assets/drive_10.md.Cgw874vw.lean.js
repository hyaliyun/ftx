She was wrecked on 30 May 1815 during a storm at Waenhuiskrans, near Cape Agulhas, South Africa, with the loss of 372 lives ‚Äì only six on board survived. She had been chartered as a troopship and was underway from Ceylon to England on a journey to repatriate wounded soldiers from the Kandyan Wars. Controversially, the ship did not have a marine chronometer on board, a comparatively new navigational instrument that was an \\"easy and cheap addition to her equipment\\" that would have enabled her to determine her longitude accurately. Instead, she was forced to navigate through the heavy storm and strong currents using older, less reliable navigational aids and dead reckoning. Navigational difficulties and a lack of headway led to an incorrect assumption that Cape Agulhas was Cape Point. Consequently, Arniston was wrecked when her captain headed north for St Helena, operating on the incorrect belief the ship had already passed Cape Point. Overview East Indiamen operated under charter or licence to the Honourable East India Company, which held a monopoly granted by Queen Elizabeth I of England for all English trade between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn. Arniston was built at the Barnard yard at Deptford on the Thames and launched in 1794.Mitchell 2007, tertiary sources. Arniston was heavily armed, with her fifty-eight guns making her the equivalent of a Royal Navy fourth-rate ship of the line. A classification of \\"ship of the line\\" ‚Äì a class of ship that later evolved into the battleship ‚Äì meant that a ship was powerful enough to stand in a line of battle and explained why these ships of commerce were sometimes mistaken for men-o-war. The armament was necessary for the ship to protect herself and her valuable cargo from pirates and commerce raiders of other nations during long voyages between Europe and the Far East. Arniston, like other East Indiamen, was slow and unmanoeuvrable, but able to carry a large quantity of cargo.Port Cities UK, secondary sources Voyages (1794‚Äì1812) Arniston sailed from Great Britain to the Far East eight times before her last voyage.BL 1812, primary sources. On one of her homeward journeys from China, she struck an uncharted rock at , near the island of Pulo Goondy (modern day Pulau Legundi), located just south of Sumatra. She did not suffer any ill effects as a result of this incident however, which is mentioned in journals of the time only for its noteworthiness as a navigation hazard to other shipping.The date of the incident is not documented. Murray et al., primary sources Apart from this and another incident in 1800, Arnistons first eight voyages were uneventful. =Voyage number 1: St Helena, Madras, and China (1795‚Äì1797)= Captain Campbell Marjoribanks: * 3 April 1795: Portsmouth * 14 April: Tenerife * 2 June: St Helena * 9 August: Cape of Good Hope * 27 September: Madras * 14 November: Penang * 3 December: Malacca * 11 March 1796: Whampoa * 23 April: Second Bar * 29 June: Macau * 20 November: St Helena * 1 March 1797: Deptford While Arniston was at St Helena on her outward journey, she undertook to transport troops from there to join Lord Elphinstone, who was undertaking an expedition to capture Cape Colony from the Dutch. On 10 July George Vancouver arrived in . Vancouver was returning to England after his four-and-a-half-year long voyage of exploration. He transferred to Arniston four field guns that he had been carrying, together with what ammunition he had left for them, for onward transmission to Elphinstone. Discoverys boats also helped in the ferrying of troops from shore to Arniston.Vancouver (1798), Vol. 3, p.476. Arniston was to ferry nine field pieces, as well as a company of artillery and three of infantry (393 men in all), to Elphinstone.Hardy (1835), p.163. =Voyage number 2: China (1797‚Äì1798)= On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain William Macnamara, and dated 13 May 1797. Her itinerary was: * 5 June 1797: Portsmouth * 29 August: Cape of Good Hope * 9 December: Whampoa * 14 February 1798: Second Bar * 26 March: Macau * 5 August: St Helena * 23 October: Long Reach =Voyage number 3: St Helena, Benkulen, and China (1800‚Äì1801)= On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain Campbell Marjoribanks, and dated 29 November 1799.

Arniston cut her anchor and gave chase, firing several broadsides into the other ship, but the faster French ship was able to make an escape.Lindsay 1874, primary sources. On 9 October 1800, the East Indiaman Kent would be less fortunate; Confiance would capture Kent after a two-hour engagement.James, 1837, primary sources. =Voyage number 4: St Helena, Benkulen, and China (1801‚Äì1803)= Captain Campbell Marjoribanks: * 31 December 1801: Downs * 9 March 1802: St Helena * 10 June: Benkulen * 12 July: Penang * 31 August: Whampoa * 24 October: Second Bar * 11 February 1803: St Helena * 26 April: Long Reach =Voyage number 5: China (1804‚Äì1805)= On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain James Jameson, and dated 24 March 1804. Her itinerary was: On 9 June 1804, Arniston left St. Helens, Isle of Wight, as part of a convoy of nine East Indiamen of the British East India Company, all bound for China. The Indiamen were , , Cuffnells, , , , , and . provided the escort.Evans: Finding my ancestors: Voyage of the Athenienne to China in 1804/1805. The fleet arrived at Rio de Janeiro around 14‚Äì18 August. It then passed the Cape of Good Hope. From here, rather than passing through the Indian Ocean and the Straits of Malacca, the fleet sailed south of Western Australia and through Bass Strait. The objectives were two-fold: to avoid French ships reported to be in the Indian Ocean, and to improve the charting of Bass Strait.Lee (2003). The ships then sailed to Norfolk Island, which was the next rendezvous point after Saint Paul Island, for members that had separated. Taunton Castle had separated in the South Atlantic and although she arrived at Norfolk Island three days after the fleet had sailed on, did not rejoin the rest of the fleet until she arrived at Haerlem Bay, in China. The arrival of Athenienne and the East Indiamen at Norfolk Island sowed panic among the colonists there who feared that a French flotilla had arrived.Evans: Finding my ancestors: Voyage of the Athenienne to China in 1804/1805. The fleet arrived at Whampoa in mid-January 1805. The fleet then returned to England via the Straits of Malacca. Arniston, for example, crossed the second Bar on 14 February, reached Malacca on 21 March and St Helena on 30 June, and arrived at Long Reach on 15 September. =Voyage number 6: China (1806‚Äì1807)= On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain Peter Wedderburn dated 20 March 1806.Wedderburn was perhaps not a notable individual in his own right, but he was part of a wealthy and well-connected family. For example, his brother was Andrew Colville, and his uncle, John Wedderburn of Ballendean, led the family business. Her itinerary was: * 14 May 1806: Portsmouth * 7 August: Cape of Good Hope * 10 October: Penang * 21 January 1807: Whampoa * 4 May: off Lintin Island * 1 July: Penang * 17 July: Acheh * 19 September: Cape of Good Hope * 13 October: St Helena * 6 January 1808: Lower Hope =Voyage number 7: Bombay and China (1810‚Äì1811)= Captain Samuel Landon: * 21 January 1810: Portsmouth * 9 April: Cape of Good Hope * 26 May: Bombay * 1 September: Penang * 12 October: Whampoa * 29 December: Second Bar * 28 May 1811: St Helena * 13 August: Long Reach =Voyage number 8: Bombay and China (1812‚Äì1813)= On this voyage Arniston sailed under a letter of marque in the name of Captain Walter Campbell. Her itinerary was: * 4 January 1812: Torbay * 5 April: Johanna * 7 May: Bombay * 11 September: Whampoa * 4 January 1813: Macau * 27 March: St Helena * 7 June: Long Reach The British government then chartered Arniston as a troop transport to the Cape and India. =Voyage number 9: Madeira, Cape, and Ceylon (1814‚Äì1815)= Captain George Simpson left England on 8 June 1814. At Ceylon, Arniston embarked soldiers of the 73rd Regiment, who were wounded in the Kandyan Wars in Ceylon, to repatriate them to England. Wreck (1815) Critically, the ship did not have a chronometer‚Äîa comparatively new navigational instrument that was an \\"easy and cheap addition to her equipment\\" at the time‚Äîfor this voyage. Captain George Simpson could not afford the 60‚Äì100 guineas for one,Hall 1820, primary sources. and the ship's owners were also unwilling to purchase one, even threatening to replace him with another captain if he refused to set sail without one.Hall 1833, primary sources. Arniston sailed from Port de Galle on 4 April 1815 in a convoy of six other East Indiamen, under the escort of HMS Africaine and .Grocott 1997, primary sources Among her 378 passengers were many invalid soldiers and sailors, plus 14 women and 25 children. During the passage from Ceylon, at one o'clock every day, the ships signalled each other their longitude that they calculated using their chronometers. In this way, the ships were able to compare their respective instruments, and the master of the Arniston was able to learn his longitude too, as long as he remained in the convoy. On 26 May, while rounding the southern tip of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation. Coastline at Arniston. The seaside village of Waenhuiskrans, Western Cape has become so associated with the wreck that it is known as Arniston. On 29 May, land was sighted to the north at 7 am, and given the dead reckoning estimates, was presumed to be the Cape of Good Hope. The ship sailed west until 4:30 pm on 29 May, then turned north to run for St Helena. However the land sighted had in fact been Cape Agulhas (then known as \\"Cape L'Agullas\\") and the ship had also not made good headway against the current since this sighting. Compounding these navigational errors, the master had not taken any depth soundings (which would have confirmed his location over the Agulhas Bank), before heading north. Consequently, instead of being west of the Cape of Good Hope as presumed, the ship was closing on the reef at Waenhuiskrans near Cape Agulhas. The anchors were unable to hold the heavy ship in the storm, so on 30 May near 4 pm, Lieutenant Brice advised Captain Simpson to ground the ship to save the lives of those aboard. Eight minutes later, at about 8 pm, the ship struck rocks half a mile offshore and heeled into the wind. The guns on the opposite side were cut away in a failed attempt to level the ship, which soon started to break up in the waves.AJ 1816, primary sources. Only six men of the 378 people on board survived, after reaching the shore only with great difficulty through the high surf. The following morning the sternpost was the only part of the vessel still visible. The ship and her passengers had been lost for lack of a chronometer, or as an officer from the same convoy later wrote: Aftermath right The six survivors buried the bodies found on the beach, then travelled east along the beach, expecting to reach Cape Town. However, after four and a half days, they realised their error and returned to the site of the wreck. Here they subsisted off a cask of oatmeal, while trying to effect repairs to the ship's pinnace, which had been washed ashore. They were discovered six days later on 14 June by a farmer's son,The farmer's son probably had the Afrikaans name \\"Jan Zwartz\\" or perhaps \\"Jan Swart\\". The earliest report consulted referred to him as \\"John Swastry\\" (AJ 1816:34), but this seems an Anglicisation or phonetic corruption of an oral account. A later report names him \\"Jan Zwartz\\" (George Thompson, 1827, Travels and Adventures in Southern Africa, 2nd edition, Vol. 2, p. 405, quoting the account of survivor C. S. Scott in a version slightly different from AJ 1816:34). Later again, we have him as \\"young Schwartz\\" (Raikes 1846:527). who was out hunting. * Among the victims were: Captain George Simpson, Lieutenant Brice, Lord and Lady Molesworth. * The six survivors were: Dr. Gunter (boatswain), John Barrett (carpenter), Charles Stewart Scott (carpenter's mate), William Grung (second class), Gibbs (third class), Robinson (fourth class). A memorial, a replica of which can be seen today, was erected on the beach by the wife of Colonel Giels, whose four children were lost in the tragedy on their homeward journey, having visited him in Ceylon. The memorial bears the following inscription:Note the incorrect date on the memorial, which should be 30 May. Over time, the seaside village of Waenhuiskrans has become so associated with the wreck, that it now is also known as Arniston. The nearby town of Bredasdorp has a museum dedicated to the wreck. The wreck had a direct influence on the decision to build a lighthouse at Cape Agulhas to the west in 1847‚Äì1848.Proposals for a Lighthouse at L'Agulhas, secondary sources. Thirty seven years later, the 73rd Regiment once again suffered hundreds of casualties on this coast when was wrecked away at Gansbaai. Archaeological excavation The wreck, which lies in about of water, was surveyed by an archaeological team from the University of Cape Town (UCT) in 1982. The National Monuments Council issued a permit to UCT student Jim Jobling to conduct an underwater survey of the site, as well as a limited excavation. A number of artefacts were recovered, which were donated to the Bredasdorp Shipwreck Museum.

Pinsker studied stochastic processes under A. N. Kolmogorov in the 1950s, and later worked at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems (IITP), Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. His accomplishments included a classic paper on the entropy theory of dynamical systems which introduced the maximal partition with zero entropy, later known as Pinsker's partition. His work in mathematical statistics was devoted mostly to the applications of information theory, including asymptotically sufficient statistics for parameter estimation and nonparametric estimation; Pinsker's inequality is named after him.

Passamezzo and Romanesca melodic formula on D . Romanesca was a melodic-harmonic formula popular from the mid 16th to early 17th centuries, used as an aria formula for singing poetry and as a subject for instrumental variation.

A famous example is the refrain of \\"Greensleeves\\" (whose verses follow the progression of the passamezzo antico, of which the romanesca is an alteration) . The romanesca is usually in triple meter and its soprano formula (melody) resembles that of the passamezzo antico but a third higher.Apel, Willi (1997). The History of Keyboard Music to 1700, p.263.

He created the title roles of Gaetano Donizetti's Il duca d'Alba (1882) and Verdi's Simon Boccanegra (1857) as well as the role of Renato in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (1859). Portrait of Leone Giraldoni Giraldoni studied in Florence with Luigi Ronzi and made his d√©but as the High Priest in Pacini's Saffo (Lodi, 1847). He made his La Scala d√©but as Il Conte di Luna in Il trovatore in 1850 and during his long career sang throughout Europe with considerable success. His final performance was in Filippo Marchetti's Don Giovanni d'Austria at Rome's Teatro Costanzi in 1885. After his retirement he taught voice and singing, first in Milan, and from 1891 at the Moscow Conservatory.Rosenthal, H. and Warrack, J.

Contemporary accounts describe his voice as warm, smooth and evenly produced. He also was considered to be an effective actor, with a noble and dignified stage presence and beautiful phrasing, qualities which made him one of Verdi's favourite baritones.Gaspare Vetro, Dizionario della musica e dei musicisti dei territori del Ducato di Parma e Piacenza, Istituzione Casa della Musica, Parma, 2002. Giraldoni belonged to a distinguished generation of baritones able to perform the then demanding new works of Verdi, as well as the existing bel canto operatic repertoire, with exemplary style and technical skill. Personal life Giraldoni was married to the well-known soprano and violinist Carolina Ferni. Their son, Eugenio Giraldoni (1870‚Äì1924), became a leading baritone like his father.

First and foremost, Versamats were designed for short roll/single photo developing. Many places, however, have used it for long roll film; it can handle film up to approx. 12 inches wide. With long rolls, however, there are a lot of problems because the film passes over many rollers. Most long roll film processors, on the other hand, use one roller at the top and bottom of each tank, which means that the film contacts only a few of them for the entire run. The Versamat has multiple uses and possible processing styles. For instance, the Versamat 1140 has 7 tanks, each with a full rack in it. The film goes in the supply side, and follows the racks up and down through the tanks to be processed. Most Versamats use developer, followed by a stop bath, fix, water wash, and finally conditioner. Some variations don't require the stop bath. The Versamat also has control over the height of the liquid/chemical, as well as speed of the film, to determine how long it is in each solution. Usual speeds are 25-35 fpm, with a developer temp of 90 F‚Äì95 F and a drybox temp of 128‚Äì135 F Put simply, the developer converts the latent image to a visible one, fix stops the development, water washes off the fix, and conditioner helps to restore the hardness of the emulsion. Finally, the film goes through the dry box to remove volatile chemicals and to dry it. As well, there are static removers at the exit end of the dry box.

B., was a political cartoonist, caricaturist, painter and lithographer. He was the eldest son of a Dublin silk mercer, and came from a Roman Catholic family which in the 17th century had been granted extensive estates, possibly in County Offaly or County Laois, and their own coat of arms, but had suffered for their religion and since been dispossessed. In his youth he learned to paint landscapes under Gaspare Gabrielli, and miniature portraits at the Royal Dublin Society's drawing school under John Comerfield. He won a gold medal in 1805. He was commissioned to paint equestrian portraits of the Marquess of Sligo and Lord Talbot, the Irish viceroy, and in 1822 he produced six prints entitled The Life of a Racehorse. That year he moved to London with his wife, Marianna Conan. His painting Turning out the Stag brought him recognition when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1825. Marianna died in 1832, giving birth to their seventh child. Doyle continued to exhibit miniatures until 1835, but by then he was experiencing greater success with his political cartoons, printed using the new reproductive medium of lithography, beginning in 1827. These were issued once a month during parliamentary sessions, and continued for twenty-two years. His caricatures were mostly faithful likenesses of their subjects, with little exaggeration, treated with sarcastic humour, often alluding to popular plays. They were signed with the letters H. B., constructed out of two Js and two Ds, Doyle's own initials. By 1840 he was prosperous enough to afford a fashionable house in Hyde Park, moving in the same circles as David Wilkie, Walter Scott, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Thomas Macaulay, Thomas Moore and Samuel Rogers - but H. B.'s true identity remained a closely guarded secret until he revealed it in 1843 in a seventeen-page letter to Sir Robert Peel. In the 1840s, at the height of his popularity, indices of H.B.'s prints were published in The Times and by the publisher McLean, but his reputation faded. His later prints were gentle in their humour and drawn in a soft, indistinct style. Thackeray said his cartoons, although clever and witty, were too \\"genteel\\" to raise more than a gentlemanly smile - \\"You will never hear any laughing at 'H. B.'\\" When he died in 1868, his obituary in The Art Journal did not appear until three months after his death, and a posthumous sale of his sketches at Christie's in 1882 was cancelled for lack of buyers. However, he is considered a founder of the school of British cartoon satirists represented by John Leech, John Tenniel, and his son Richard Doyle, which established the style made famous by Punch magazine. The British Museum has over 900 of his drawings in its collections. He died at Maida Hill, 2 January 1868, and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His sons included the illustrator James William Edmund Doyle (1822‚Äì1892); the painter, illustrator and cartoonist Richard Doyle (1824‚Äì1883); Henry Edward Doyle, (1827‚Äì1892) who became director of the National Gallery of Ireland; and the painter Charles Altamont Doyle (1832‚Äì1893), through whom he was a grandfather of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the novelist and creator of Sherlock Holmes.Kenneth Baker, \\"Doyle, John [H.

Known both for its castle and Basilian monastery of the Annunciation with an icon of the Mother of God. First written mention of a fortified Ruthenian settlement, then called Plisnensk, comes from 1188 and 1233, found in chronicles from Kiev and Halych-Volhynia as well as in the Tale of Igor's Campaign. The first Basilian monastery is recorded to have been founded by a princess named Helen in 1180. In the 15th century it is referred to by the present day name and in 1440 granted by king Ladislaus III of Poland to its tenant, the Podhorecki noble family. In 1635 the village was purchased by the Grand Crown Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, who built a fortified residence there. In 1682 it was inherited by the Sobieski family. During the first half of the 18th century the present complex of the Basilian monastery was constructed and in 1754 the icon was crowned by Pope Benedict XIV. In 1728 the castle was purchased by the Rzewuski family and expanded by Wac≈Çaw Rzewuski, who also built the Roman Catholic Church of St. Joseph, consecrated in 1766. Finally from 1869 until 1939 the complex became the property of the Sanguszko family, who turned it into a museum. Pidhirtsi suffered heavily from the war and Soviet rule, and its collection was scattered among different museums in Poland and Ukraine. In 1997 the devastated castle was given to the Lviv Art Gallery and is gradually undergoing restoration. Worship in Polish and Ukrainian is held in St. Joseph's Church.

It is a hole in the ground filled with ash, possibly containing hot embers beneath. It is one of the many hazards faced by those fighting wildfires. It is also a danger to residents and their pets returning after a wildfire has gone out. An ash pit may be imperceptible from the ground above, and can remain hot for days. Those accidentally walking into one may be severely burned or killed. After a wildfire has gone out, firefighters may detect ash pits from helicopters using infrared sensors. Then can then dig down into them, and extinguish them to prevent flare ups. Causes After a fire burns underground fuels, it can create a void that becomes filled with ash from the burned fuel. There are several environmental factors that increase the likelihood of an ash pit being formed. It may result from the presence of extensive root systems of trees and shrubs, as well as peat and deep duff covering mineral soil. Holes created by animals, such as coyote and badger dens, can become ash pits. Abandoned rodent holes can become filled with dry, organic debris. Once this debris is burned, an ash pit may be produced. Areas that have been modified by humans may also become hazardous ash pits. Examples include areas modified with heavy equipment, former bulldozer piles, as well as sawmill sites and timber yards. Detection An ash pit may sometimes be detected by the presence of white ash or swarms of insects hovering about. Nearly translucent smoke that quickly dissipates may be visible emanating from an ash pit when it is between the observer and the sun. Due to incomplete burning, an ash pit may also produce a smell of burning creosote or incomplete combustion. Mitigation Upon detection, marking or flagging ash pits is advised.

The band released four full-length records as Transtic Nerve and two full-length records as The Underneath. As Transtic Nerve, the band played more straightforward rock styled music, but in 2007 shifted to a heavier and darker style upon transforming to The Underneath. In 2010, the group disbanded and reformed (without second guitarist Tal) under the name Defspiral.  History  Transtic Nerve was formed in November 1995 with the lineup of Tal on guitar, Ryo on bass and Masaki on drums. The band later recruited Taka as vocalist and Masato as second guitarist. The following August, Transtic Nerve released their debut album, Transtic Vision. In 1998, the band was noticed by famed guitarist hide (formerly of X Japan) and signed to his label, Lemoned. However, due to hide's death soon after, the band was let go without having released anything on the label. The next year, Transtic Nerve released their first single, \\"Shindou\\", and their first major label album, Cell Flash, on Unlimited Records in July 1999. In 2000, the band released two more singles, \\"Into Yourself\\" and \\"Binetsu\\", both accompanied by lengthy tours spanning most of the year. After touring, the band released another single, \\"Manazahi no Mukou e\\", followed by an album, Recall, in March 2001. After touring in support of Recall, the band released another single, \\"Manatsu no Yoru no Highway Star\\" in late 2001. Between 2002 and 2004, the band saw very few releases, with only one original studio album, Raise a Flag in 2004. Following their 2004 release, the band transitioned into a new style with more metal influence, and in 2005 Transtic Nerve released an EP, Hole in the Wall, demonstrating the new direction. After a long pause in activity, Transtic Nerve resurfaced in 2007 with the announcement of a new band identity, the Underneath.

The Underneath eventually announced their first album, Moon Flower, to be released in March 2008, first in the United States on the newly formed JShock label, partly founded by Yoshiki of X Japan. After the completion of the Taste of Chaos tour, the band performed for the first time in Japan at the hide memorial summit. There, they played on the second day of the festival, alongside fellow Taste of Chaos bands D'espairsRay and Mucc, and others including X Japan, Luna Sea and Dir en grey. The Underneath's first headlining performance in Japan took place on June 13, 2008 at Shibuya O-West. The band played along with fellow Japanese groups MarBell and DaizyStripper at Otakon 2008, on August 10, 2008 in Baltimore, MD. In November 2009, they released their second album, entitled Us. in Japan. The band announced that they would disband on May 3, 2010.

The standard was first introduced in 1999 and was created to facilitate integration of DSP algorithms into systems without re-engineering cost. The XDAIS standard address the issues of algorithm resource allocation and consumption on a DSP. Algorithms that comply with the standard are tested and awarded an \\"eXpressDSP-compliant\\" mark upon successful completion of the test. The standard consists of a set of general rules and guidelines that should be applied to all algorithms. For instance, all XDAIS compliant algorithms must implement an Algorithm Interface, called IALG. For those algorithms utilizing DMA, the IDMA interface must be implemented. Further, specific rules are provided for each family of TI DSP. Problems are often caused in algorithm by hard-coding access to system resources that are used by other algorithms. XDAIS prohibits the use of this type of hard-coding. Instead, XDAIS requires a standard API for the application to call a particular algorithm class. This API is defined in the xDM standard, also referred to as the VISA APIs (video, imaging, speech and audio). A XDAIS developer's kit provides the standard itself, example code, and a demonstration. Benefits of XDAIS over non- standardised approaches include: * Significant reduction in integration time as algorithms do not trash each other's resources * Easy comparison of algorithms from multiple different sources in the same application * Access to broad range of compliant algorithms available from multiple TI DSP Third Parties eliminates need to custom develop complex algorithms * Algorithms work out-of-the-box with eXpressDSP Multimedia Framework Products, such as Codec Engine (TI) See also *eXpressDsp External links * XpressDSP Algorithm Standard ‚Äì xDAIS Developer‚Äôs Kit and xDM * TMS320 DSP Algorithm Standard Developer‚Äôs Guide Category:Texas Instruments Category:Digital signal processing ","title":"XDAIS algorithms"},{"id":"14102488","text":"Jack Vinall (16 December 1910 ‚Äì 26 May 1997) was a footballer and a member of the Norwich City Hall of Fame.

Education and early career Whitehouse received his B.A. degree in social anthropology from the London School of Economics in 1985. He completed his PhD in Anthropology at the University of Cambridge in 1990. Whitehouse is generally regarded as one of the founders of the cognitive science of religion field. After carrying out two years of field research on a 'cargo cult' in New Britain, Papua New Guinea, in the late 1980s, he developed a theory of \\"modes of religiosity\\" that has been the subject of extensive critical evaluation and testing by social anthropologists, historians, archaeologists, and sociologists. The theory of modes of religiosity seeks to explain the role of ritual in processes of group bonding and in the evolution of social complexity. Two modes are distinguished: imagistic and doctrinal. In the imagistic mode, collective rituals are infrequent and highly emotional, giving rise to tightknit local groups. In the doctrinal mode, rituals are frequent and relatively tame, producing indefinitely expandable communities with standardized beliefs and practices. Whitehouse‚Äôs published corpus includes a trilogy of books outlining his theory on modes of religiosity and the dysphoric pathway to identity fusion.Whitehouse, H.; Lanman, J. A. (December 2014). The Ties That Bind Us: Ritual, Fusion, and Identification. Current Anthropology. 55(6): 674-695. doi: 10.1086/678698. Later research and career Since the turn of the millennium, Whitehouse has focused increasingly on developing trans-disciplinary collaborations using methods as diverse as ethnographic fieldwork, experiments, interviews, and surveys in lab, field, and online settings, database construction, semantic network analysis, and other methods. In the process, Whitehouse‚Äôs research programme has gradually expanded beyond religion to examine the role of rituals of all kinds in binding groups together and motivating inter-group competition, including warfare. Together with John Alderdice, Scott Atran, and Richard Davis, Whitehouse is a founding fellow of Oxford‚Äôs Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict at Harris Manchester College. He is also a founding editor of Seshat: Global History Databank, together with Peter Turchin and Pieter Francois. Whitehouse‚Äôs other long-term collaborators include Quentin Atkinson, Amy Bogaard, Michael Buhrmester, Thomas Currie, Michael Hochberg, Ian Hodder, Jonathan Jong, Jonathan Lanman, Cristine Legare, Ryan McKay, and William B. Swann. Whitehouse was founding director of the Institute of Cognition and Culture (Queen‚Äôs University Belfast) and the Centre for Anthropology and Mind (University of Oxford). While Head of the School of Anthropology at the University of Oxford (2006-2009) he established the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology. Whitehouse has been principal investigator on several large collaborative initiatives including: the Explaining Religion project, funded by the European Commission, the Ritual, Community and Conflict project funded by the UK‚Äôs Economic and Social Research Council, and the Ritual Modes project funded by an Advanced Grant from the European Research Council.

Spontaneous potentials are often measured down boreholes for formation evaluation in the oil and gas industry, and they can also be measured along the Earth's surface for mineral exploration or groundwater investigation. The phenomenon and its application to geology was first recognized by Conrad Schlumberger, Marcel Schlumberger, and E.G. Leonardon in 1931, and the first published examples were from Romanian oil fields. Physics Spontaneous potentials (SP) are usually caused by charge separation in clay or other minerals, due to presence of semi-permeable interface impeding the diffusion of ions through the pore space of rocks, or by natural flow of a conducting fluid through the rocks. The origin of SP across formation can be attributed to two processes involving the movement of ions: # Streaming potential (Ek) # Electrochemical potential (Ec) Streaming potential originates from the flow of an electrolyte (water) over naturally charged solids (i.e., surfaces that acquired electrokinetic or zeta potential). The streaming potential appears when mud filtrate is forced into the formation under the differential pressure between mud column and formation. The streaming potential is produced when the flow takes place across mud-cake in front of permeable formations, across permeable formations being invaded, and across shale beds. It is generally accepted that the streaming potential across the mud-cake is compensated by that across the shale. As such, in most cases, the spontaneous potential measured is only related to the electrochemical potential. Electrochemical potential (EC) is the sum of liquid junction or diffusion potential (EJ), and membrane potential (EM) Fig1: Electrochemical Potential: Liquid junction & membrane potential Liquid junction potential is established at the direct contact of the mud filtrate and formation water at the edge of the invaded formation. Ions Na+ and Cl‚àí diffuse from either solution to the other, but at different rate due to different mobilities. Na+ tends to be less mobile due to its affinity for water molecules. : EJ = K1 log10(aw/amf) where: : K1 = 11.6 mV at 25 ¬∞C : aw = formation water ionic activity : amf = mud filtrate ionic activity Membrane Potential develops when two electrolytes of different ionic concentrations, such as mud and formation water, are separated by shale. The clay minerals in shale are usually made up of atom Al, Si, and O. O2‚àí ions occupy the outer layer and cause a net negative charge. Na+ ions from solution are attracted and allowed to pass through the shale, while Cl‚àí ions are repelled. Na+ ions will migrate between the two solutions, with a net influx from the more saline to the less. : EM = K2 log10(aw/amf) where: : K2 = 2.3 RT/F, where: ::R = ideal gas constant ::T = absolute temperature in kelvins ::F = Faraday constant ::aw = formation water ionic activity ::amf = mud filtrate ionic activity The total electrochemical potential is thus summarized as EC = EM \\\\+ EJ = K log10(aw/amf) Since spontaneous potential is a measure of electrochemical potential and the ionic activity of a solution is inversely proportional to its resistivity, the above equation can be simplified as SP = EC = K log10 (Rmfe/Rwe), where Rmfe and Rwe are equivalent mud filtrate resistivity and equivalent formation water resistivity respectively. The ideal spontaneous potential across clean bed is known as Static SP (SSP), and defined as follow: :SSP = ‚àíK log10 (Rmfe/Rwe) Applications in Boreholes The most useful SP component is the electrochemical potential, since it can cause a significant deflection opposite permeable beds. The magnitude of the deflection depends mainly on the salinity contrast between borehole and formation fluid, and the clay content of the permeable bed. The SP log is therefore useful in detecting permeable beds and to estimate formation water salinity and formation clay content. Due to the nature of the electric current, SP can only be recorded in conductive mud. =Determination of Rw= As established earlier, static SP is defined as follow: :SSP = ‚àíK log (Rmfe/Rwe) Static SP (SSP) can be obtained directly from the SP curve if the bed is clean, thick, porous, permeable, and only moderately invaded. When these conditions are not met, the recorded SP will need to be corrected. Various correction charts are available for this purpose. To convert the measured mud filtrate resistivity Rmf into an equivalent mud filtrate resistivity Rmfe, the following rules are employed: * If Rmf at 75 ¬∞F is greater than 0.1 Œ©¬∑m, use Rmfe = 0.85 Rmf at formation temperature. * If Rmf at 75 ¬∞F is less than 0.1 Œ©¬∑m, derive Rmfe from Rmf using Schlumberger Chart SP-2 or equivalent. Schlumberger Chart SP-2 can then be used to convert Rwe to obtain Rw. Applications on the surface Electrodes can be placed on the ground surface to map relative changes in the SP value (in millivolts, or mV), typically with the goal of identifying the path of groundwater flow in the subsurface, or seepage from an earthen dam. A voltmeter measures the voltage between a fixed liquid-junction electrode and a mobile one (rover), which is moved along a dam face or over an area of investigation to collect multiple readings. Anomalies observed may indicate groundwater movement or seepage.Corwin, R. F., 1990, The self-potential method for environmental and engineering applications, in Ward, S. H., editor, Geotechnical and Environmental Geophysics, Volume I: Review and Tutorial, Society of Exploration Geophysicists, Tulsa, OK Interpretation SP can be affected by several factors that complicates the interpretation. Beside petrochemical component, SP is also affected by electrokinetic potential and bimetallism. Besides, SP is also affected by the following factors: * Bed thickness (h); Since SP is a measurement of electrical potential produced by current in the mud, its amplitude approaches the SSP value only when the resistance to current due to formation and adjacent beds is negligible compared with that of the mud. This condition is met only in thick bed. In thin beds, the SP is proportionally reduced. * True resistivity (Rt) of permeable bed; As Rt/Rm increases, the SP deflection decreases, and the bed boundaries are less sharply defined. Presence of hydrocarbons also attenuates SP. * Resistivity of invaded zone (Rxo) and mud resistivity (Rm); SP increases with increase of Rxo/Rm * Diameter of invasion (di); SP decreases as invasion deepens * Ratio of mud filtrate to formation water salinities: Rmf/Rw * Neighbouring shale resistivity (Rs); SP increases with increase of Rs/Rm * Hole diameter (dh); With increasing hole size, the value of SP is reduced Measurement technique Spontaneous potential can be measured by placing one probe of a voltmeter at the Earth's surface (called surface electrode) and the other probe in the borehole (called downhole electrode), where the SP is to be measured. In fact, logging tools employ exactly this method. Since this measurement is relatively simple, usually SP downhole electrode is built into other logging tools.

As of 2011, the commune had a total population of 27,523 people. It lies in the Sahel, the semi-arid, sparsely populated zone between the Sahara Desert to the north and the millet- growing savannah to the south. Raising goats, camels, and cattle is the traditional livelihood for people in this region, which gets only a few weeks of rain per year. However, recurrent drought since the 1970s has caused the starvation of many animals. This has forced many previously nomadic and semi- nomadic people to settle in and around Aderbissinat and other Sahelian towns. Villages within Aderbissinat include Marendet. Aderbissinat is ethnically and linguistically mixed, with residents of Hausa, Tuareg, and Arab origin. Nomadic Fula cattle-herders also come into town regularly to sell their wares. Although isolated, the town lies on a major trans-Saharan route linking Algeria to Nigeria. The nearest cities are Agadez to the north and Zinder to the south.

On 1 January 1943, Headquarters No. 9 OG assumed responsibility for the formation's administration as well as its operations, making it independent of North-Eastern Area. Air Commodore Joe Hewitt became Air Officer Commanding No. 9 OG in February 1943.

Current partners are based in Brussels, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the UK and has over 30 member NGOs across these countries. Interact Worldwide provides the overall co-ordination for the network. Action For Global Health Official Webpage  Objectives  The overarching goal of Action for Global Health is increased support from Europe to enable developing countries to make substantial progress towards the health Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Action for Global Health's members are monitoring the actions and policies of European governments for how they affect health in developing countries, influencing decision-makers to improve their practice and be inviting other NGOs and civil society organisations to join with the Action for Global Health to build a European campaign. The Action for Global Health wants to see our governments, the private sector and European institutions fulfill the promises they have made on reducing rates of infant and maternal mortality and slowing down the spread of transmissible diseases in the world's poorest countries. In particular, the Action for Global Health wants to see much greater support for the development and strengthening of health systems, through proper financing, retention of staff and ensuring equitable access. Three Main Goals: * Increased commitment and action from European governments ‚Äì primarily the EU institutions, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, United Kingdom and Spain - to support the achievement of the Health MDGs in low and middle-income countries; including higher and better-focused financial contributions to health and health system strengthening. * Increased capacity, engagement and effectiveness of European NGOs‚Äô advocacy in support of the Health MDGs, with improved policy analysis and networking with the NGO and development policy community (recognising the role of health as a key lever of development). * Increased support from European civil society and the private sector for the achievement of the Health MDGs in low and middle-income countries, including a higher profile for global health in European media.  Publications  In 2007, Action for Global Health partners published their first set of policy reports \\"Health Warning\\" in six different versions: Brussels, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK: * Brussels report - Health Warning (EU version) Why Europe must act now to rescue the health Millennium Development Goals. Action for Global Health is concerned that Europe is not yet doing enough to support developing countries achieve the health MDGs by 2015. The focus of this first report is on funding provided by European governments for health in developing countries through their Official Development Assistance (ODA). * French report - Health Warning Le sujet de ce rapport porte sur les financements de l'acc√®s √† la sant√© et aux soins de sant√© dans les pays en d√©veloppement.

Adem√°s, incluye un an√°lisis espec√≠fico sobre los compromisos de Espa√±a con los ODM de salud. * UK - Health Warning Why Europe and the UK must act now to rescue the health Millennium Development Goals. This version of the report includes a chapter on the UK's role in financing the health MDGs and calls on the UK Government to prioritise this area early in order to enable developing countries achieve the health MDGs by 2015.  Funding  The network was initiated through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as part of their support for global health advocacy. Similar networks on reproductive health, Malaria and Tuberculosis have been funded.  Partners  When established in 2006 the grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was administered by Action Aid as the European Network on Global Health. At the first meeting of network staff funded by the grant, in Paris in February 2007, the partners established the name Action for Global Health and a three line tag line to outline its vision and purpose: Full Funding, Strong Systems, Fair Access. At this time the partners were: EU - Brussels: European Public Health Alliance, Marie-Stopes International, Stop Aids Alliance France: M√©decins du Monde, Global Health Advocates Germany: Terre des hommes (Hilfe f√ºr kinder in Not), Welthungerhilfe Italy: AIDOS, CESTAS Spain: Medicos del mundo, Spanish Association of Family Planning UK: International HIV AIDS Alliance, Interact, TB Alert, After the first full period of funding from the BMGF for AFGH ended in 2011 it was renewed with Plan Interact administering the grant to the network in place of Action Aid.

The concept was coined by Bernard John and Kenneth R. Lewis in a 1966 paper attempting to explain the geographic distribution of grasshoppers. They claimed that the particular geographic distribution could not be explained by the obvious and external \\"exophenotype\\" of the grasshoppers, but instead must be explained by their microscopic and internal \\"endophenotype\\". The next major use of the term was in psychiatric genetics, to bridge the gap between high- level symptom presentation and low-level genetic variability, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms. It is therefore more applicable to more heritable disorders, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Since then, the concept has expanded to many other fields, such as the study of ADHD, addiction, Alzheimer's disease, obesity and cystic fibrosis. Some other terms which have a similar meaning but do not stress the genetic connection as highly are \\"intermediate phenotype\\", \\"biological marker\\", \\"subclinical trait\\", \\"vulnerability marker\\", and \\"cognitive marker\\". The strength of an endophenotype is its ability to differentiate between potential diagnoses that present with similar symptoms. Definition In psychiatry research, the accepted criteria which a biomarker must fulfill to be called an endophenotype include: # An endophenotype must segregate with illness in the population. # An endophenotype must be heritable. # An endophenotype must not be state- dependent (i.e., manifests whether illness is active or in remission). # An endophenotype must co-segregate with illness within families. # An endophenotype must be present at a higher rate within affected families than in the population. # An endophenotype must be amenable to reliable measurement, and be specific to the illness of interest. For schizophrenia In the case of schizophrenia, the overt symptom could be a psychosis, but the underlying phenotypes are, for example, a lack of sensory gating and a decline in working memory. Both of these traits have a clear genetic component and can thus be called endophenotypes. A strong candidate for schizophrenia endophenotype is prepulse inhibition, the ability to inhibit the reaction to startling stimuli. However, several other task-related candidate endophenotypes have been proposed for schizophrenia, and even resting measures extracted from EEG, such as, power of frequency bands and EEG microstates. Endophenotypes are quantitative, trait-like deficits that are typically assessed by laboratory-based methods rather than by clinical observation. The four primary criteria for an endophenotype are that it is present in probands with the disorder, that it is not state-related (that is, it does not occur only during clinical episodes) but instead is present early in the disease course and during periods of remission, that it is observed in unaffected family members at a higher rate than in the general population, and that it is heritable. Some distinct genes that could underlie certain endophenotypic traits in schizophrenia include: * RELN ‚Äì coding the reelin protein downregulated in patients' brains. In one 2008 study its variants were associated with performance in verbal and visual working memory tests in the nuclear families of the sufferers. * FABP7, coding the Fatty acid-binding protein 7 (brain), one SNP of which was associated with schizophrenia in one 2008 study, is also linked to prepulse inhibition in mice. It is still uncertain though whether the finding will be replicated for human patients. * CHRNA7, coding the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit. alpha7-containing receptors are known to improve prepulse inhibition, pre- attentive and attentive states. For bipolar disorder In bipolar disorder, one commonly identified endophenotype is a deficit in face emotion labeling, which is found in both individuals with bipolar disorder and in individuals who are \\"at risk\\" (i.e., have a first degree relative with bipolar disorder). Using fMRI, this endophenotype has been linked to dysfunction in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and amygdala. A polymorphism in the CACNA1C gene coding for the voltage-dependent calcium channel Cav1.2 has been found to be associated with deficits in facial emotion recognition. For suicide The endophenotype concept has also been used in suicide studies. Personality characteristics can be viewed as endophenotypes that may exert a diathesis effect on an individual's susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Although the exact identification of these endophenotypes is controversial, certain traits such as impulsivity and aggression are commonly cited risk factors. One such genetic basis for one of these at-risk endophenotypes has been suggested in 2007 to be the gene coding for the serotonin receptor 5-HT1B, known to be relevant in aggressive behaviors.

Gaskell had to deal with rather sensitive issues, toning down some of her material: in the case of her description of the Clergy Daughters' School, attended by Charlotte and her sisters, this was to avoid legal action from the Rev. William Carus Wilson, the founder of the school. The published text does not go so far as to blame him for the deaths of two Bront√´ sisters, but even so the Carus Wilson family published a rebuttal with the title \\"A refutation of the statements in 'The life of Charlotte Bronte,' regarding the Casterton Clergy Daughters' School, when at Cowan Bridge\\". Although quite frank in many places, Gaskell suppressed details of Charlotte's love for Constantin H√©ger, a married man, on the grounds that it would be too great an affront to contemporary morals and a possible source of distress to Charlotte's still-living friends, father Patrick Bront√´ and husband.Lane 1953, pp. 178‚Äì183.

As an IRA member, she took part in the theft of paintings worth IR¬£8 million and a bomb attack on a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) station using a hijacked helicopter. Early life Dugdale was born into a wealthy English family, her millionaire father was an underwriter at Lloyd's of London who owned a estate near Axminster in Devon.MacCarthy 2007 pp.253‚Äì254 The family also owned a house in London near Chelsea Hospital,MacCarthy 2007, p. 254. and Dugdale was educated at the nearby Miss Ironside's School for Girls in Kensington, west London.MacCarthy 2007, pp. 248‚Äì249. She was a popular pupil, with Virginia Ironside stating: \\"Everyone adored this generous, clever and dashing millionaire's daughter, who was life and laughter\\". After completing her early education Dugdale was sent abroad to attend a finishing school. Then, in 1958, she was presented as a debutante before Queen Elizabeth II at the start of the social season. Her debutante ball was held in 1959, with Dugdale describing it as \\"one of those pornographic affairs which cost about what 60 old-age pensioners receive in six months\\". Later in 1959, Dugdale began reading philosophy, politics and economics at St Anne's College, University of Oxford.MacCarthy 2007, p. 255. While studying there, she began what newspapers would later describe as a \\"lunge to the left\\", when she and Jenny Grove, a fellow student, gatecrashed Oxford Union wearing wigs and men's clothing in protest at the Union's refusal to admit women undergraduates as members, encouraged from the gallery by another student, Sarah Caudwell. After completing her studies at Oxford, she travelled to the United States attending Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she obtained a master's degree in philosophy, submitting a thesis on Ludwig Wittgenstein. She also studied at the University of London, obtaining a PhD in economics. Early political activity By the early 1970s, Dugdale had become politically radicalised due to the 1968 student protests, and she had also been inspired after visiting Cuba. By 1972 she had devoted herself to helping the poor, after resigning from her job as an economist for the government, selling her house in Chelsea, and moving into a flat in Tottenham with her lover, Walter Heaton, who described himself as a \\"revolutionary socialist\\". Heaton was a court-martialled former guardsman and militant shop steward who was married with two daughters, and had been imprisoned for several minor criminal offences including burglary, obstructing the police and fraudulent consumption of electricity. Dugdale cashed in her share of the family syndicate at Lloyd's, estimated to be ¬£150,000, and distributed the money to poor people in north London. Dugdale and Heaton were involved in the civil rights movement, and together ran the Tottenham Claimants Union from a corner shop. They shared a common interest in the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland, and they made frequent trips there to take part in demonstrations. In June 1973, the couple were arrested after a burglary at the Dugdale family home in Devon.MacCarthy 2007, pp. 255‚Äì256. Paintings and silverware valued at ¬£82,000 were stolen, and police believe the proceeds were destined to be sent to the IRA by Heaton. At the trial at Exeter Crown Court Dugdale claimed to have been coerced and pleaded not guilty, and used the proceedings to publicly denounce her family and background.MacCarthy 2007, p. 256. Her father appeared as a witness for the prosecution and was cross-examined by Dugdale, who said to him: \\"I love you, but hate everything you stand for\\". The couple were found guilty, prompting Dugdale to address the jury saying \\"In finding me guilty you have turned me from an intellectual recalcitrant into a freedom fighter. I know no finer title\\". Heaton was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, and Dugdale received a two-year suspended sentence as the judge considering the risk of her committing any further criminal acts to be \\"extremely remote\\". IRA activity In the months following the trial, Dugdale travelled to Ireland and joined an IRA active service unit operating along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In January 1974, Dugdale and other IRA members, including Eddie Gallagher, hijacked a helicopter in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. Dugdale and Gallagher used the helicopter to drop bombs in milk churns on the RUC station in Strabane in Northern Ireland, the first helicopter bombing raid in the history of the British Isles. The bombs failed to explode, and Dugdale became wanted for questioning regarding the bombing with her picture in police stations across Britain and Ireland. A warrant was also issued for her arrest by Manchester Magistrates Court on 23 February 1974 on charges of conspiring to smuggle arms.Bell 1997, p.407 Vermeer's Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid, stolen in the 1974 raid On 26 April 1974, Dugdale took part in a raid on Russborough House in County Wicklow, the home of Sir Alfred Beit, 2nd Baronet. Dugdale and three other IRA members forced their way into the house, and pistol-whipped Sir Alfred and his wife before tying and gagging the couple.MacCarthy 2007, p. 257. The IRA members then stole nineteen old masters valued at IR¬£8 million, including paintings by Gainsborough, Rubens, Vermeer and Goya. The Vermeer taken was Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid, the only Vermeer in private ownership except for one at Buckingham Palace. The IRA members sent a ransom note offering to exchange the stolen paintings for IR¬£500,000 and the release of Dolours and Marian Price, two sisters convicted of IRA bombings who were on hunger strike in Brixton Prison attempting to secure repatriation to Ireland. The Garda√≠ started a nationwide hunt for the paintings, and on 4 May they raided a house rented by Dugdale in Glandore, County Cork, and discovered all nineteen paintings in the boot of a car. Dugdale was arrested under Section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, and the next day she was charged in relation to the helicopter attack and the art theft. As at her previous trial in 1973, Dugdale once again used the courtroom as a political platform, shouting \\"The British have an army of occupation in a small part of Ireland‚Äîbut not for long!\\" during her arraignment in Dublin. Dugdale's father issued a statement saying: \\"I don't want to appear hardhearted, but I've done everything I can for her. She knows perfectly well she could turn to me if she wanted to\\". In Dugdale's submission to the court during her trial she denounced Britain as \\"a filthy enemy\\" and stated the Dublin government was guilty of \\"treacherous collaboration\\" with England. On 25 June 1974 she was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment after pleading \\"proudly and incorruptibly guilty\\", and she gave a clenched fist salute to supporters in the public gallery. Imprisonment Dugdale was pregnant with Eddie Gallagher's child when she was imprisoned, and on 12 December 1974, she gave birth to a son, Ruair√≠, in Limerick Prison.Bell 1997, p. 417. On 3 October 1975 Gallagher and fellow IRA member Marion Coyle kidnapped industrialist Tiede Herrema near his home in Castletroy, a suburb of Limerick. They were traced to a house in Monasterevin, County Kildare, and a two-week siege began. Coyle and Gallagher had demanded the release of Dugdale and two other IRA members, but the authorities refused to grant any concessions. The siege ended on 7 November when Herrema was released, and Coyle and Gallagher were arrested. Gallagher and Coyle were sentenced to twenty years and fifteen years' imprisonment respectively, and in 1978 Gallagher and Dugdale received special dispensation to marry.MacCarthy 2007, p. 258. The wedding took place on 24 January 1978 inside Limerick Prison, and was the first wedding between convicted prisoners in the history of the Republic of Ireland. Dugdale was released from prison in October 1980. Later life After her release from prison, Dugdale was active in the campaign in support of protesting Irish republican prisoners during the 1981 Irish hunger strike. She is a veteran activist in the political party Sinn F√©in. In 2007, she spoke out in support of the Shell to Sea campaign against the proposed construction of a high- pressure raw gas pipeline through Rossport by Shell, saying the Shell contract was invalid and needed \\"to be renegotiated on behalf of the people of Ireland\\". She is also a director at Dublin Community Television. In 2011, she was the honouree at the annual Dublin Volunteers event, which each year acknowledges a person for their contribution to Irish republicanism. In an interview with the republican newspaper An Phoblacht before the event, Dugdale said she believed \\"the revolutionary army that was the IRA had achieved its principal objective, which was to get your enemy to negotiate with you. They did that with amazing skill and ability, and I can't help but respect what was done in terms of the Good Friday Agreement.\\" On her involvement in the IRA, she added: \\"I did what I wanted to do. I am proud to have been part of the Republican Movement, and I hope that I have played my very small part in the success of the armed struggle.\\" In 2012, she was the subject of a TG4 documentary entitled Mn√° an IRA (Women of the IRA).

He is the creation of R.A. Salvatore. Wulfgar was originally planned to be the protagonist of Salvatore's first novel series, The Icewind Dale Trilogy, which was initially to be set in the Moonshae Isles. As soon as the background was changed to Icewind Dale, Drizzt Do'Urden was invented as Wulfgar's sidekick, and succeeded him as the protagonist in following novels.Introductions by R.A. Salvatore & Ed GreenwoodSnell, George (February 2, 1995). \\"Salvatore's long quest ends with 'Sword'\\", Telegram & Gazette [Worcester, Mass], p. C1. Wulfgar returned to the major role in the novel The Spine of the World.Thousand Orcs by R. A. Salvatore (2003)The Spine of the World by R. A. Salvatore (2000) He also appears in Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn computer role-playing game as minor NPC. Appearance As described in The Crystal Shard, Wulfgar is roughly , blond-haired and blue-eyed (common for the barbarian tribes he hails from), and developed his awesomely muscled physique when he was in servitude to the dwarf Bruenor Battlehammer for five years‚Äîworking alongside dwarves, who are renowned for being tireless. Wulfgar is broad-shouldered and thick-chested with a wiry waist, and his arms have been described as thicker than a fat dwarf's thighs. Despite his bulk, he's moderately graceful. He's also relatively young and has a boyish face, and eventually grew a beard.Lavender Eyes -- Encyclopedia - Wulfgar Wulfgar has incredible strength for even his barbarian race. For instance, Wulfgar once pulled the prow of an entire ship out of the water, and once lifted a three- hundred-pound man with one arm, and then threw him through the tavern where the bar fight had begun. Also, when he challenged King Heafstaag, a mighty barbarian leader in Icewind Dale, Wulfgar literally crushed the King's head like a melon with his bare hands. Wulfgar managed to resist Heaftaag's spine shattering bear hug as he did so. He also used a large, irritable camel as a projectile weapon to defeat a gang of bandits in The Halfling's Gem, and escaped a flesh golem, Bok, that was slowly bear-hugging him to death by tearing off its head with his bare hands. Wulfgar would routinely take on foes much bigger than he and defeat them with his strength and mighty warhammer. Biography =Early years= As a youth, Wulfgar was the flag bearer for Heafstaag, king of the Elk Tribe. He participated in barbarian invasion of Ten-Towns, where Bruenor Battlehammer, a dwarf, knocked Wulfgar out by sweeping his legs out from under him. After the battle, when the people of Ten-towns were slitting throats of the barbarians not quite dead, Bruenor spared Wulfgar. Instead of death, Bruenor sentenced Wulfgar to five years and a day of service to Bruenor. Wulfgar took to the forge and, over time, changed his opinion of Bruenor from a slaver to a father. Bruenor crafted the legendary warhammer Aegis-fang as a gift for Wulfgar. When Wulfgar's sentence was almost up, Bruenor bade Drizzt Do'Urden, a drow, to teach Wulfgar how to fight. Wulfgar took up the task of killing the white dragon Icingdeath (Ingeloakastimizilian) in order to gain credibility, take leadership of his tribe and restore their glory. With the help of Drizzt, Wulfgar challenged and killed the dragon, earning the title Dragonsbane. It was in the Dragon's lair that Drizzt found his scimitar named Icingdeath, with the power to repel flames. The dragon killing scene was criticized by some Dungeons & Dragons fans for violating the game rules, as both characters were of supposedly low level. Salvatore was quoted replying: \\"I'll let the poor game designers fret about the proper levels for characters. I just write stories.\\"R.A. Salvatore chat with fans With this deed to his credit, he was able to challenge King Heafstaag to combat for leadership of the tribes. Wulfgar defeated Heafstaag, gaining rulership of the Tribe of the Elk, and led the tribes to the aid of the people of Ten-Towns. He also fell in love with Catti-brie, Bruenor's adopted human daughter. Wulfgar followed Bruenor and Drizzt in their campaign for Mithral Hall and struggle against assassin Artemis Entreri. After Mithral Hall was conquered, Wulfgar resided there. His barbarian attitude, chauvinism and jealousy led to rift between Catti-brie, Drizzt, and himself. He also became hostile towards Drizzt and Cattie-brie after being informed by Regis (who was really Artemis Entreri) and the ruby that Cattie-brie was being unfaithful to him with Drizzt. This led to him attacking Drizzt once in Mithral Hall then backing off when he was reminded Drizzt was a friend. Even after Regis was revealed to be Entreri, Wulfgar was still bitter to Cattie- brie leading to a tongue lashing from Bruenor. He and Cattie-brie partially made up after that. When a drow party from Menzoberranzan captured Drizzt, though, Wulfgar followed his friends to rescue. In the battle with a yochlol, Wulfgar caused a ceiling to cave in on himself, and the handmaiden, in order to keep it from killing Cattie-brie. His companions believed he was dead. = After resurrection = Wulfgar's death received mixed reception and affected some Forgotten Realms fans. It led to debate between author and TSR, Inc. publishing house. Editors ordered Wulfgar's resurrection in Passage to Dawn after the fans' request, despite Salvatore's argument. Later, though, Salvatore was quoted as saying \\"I'm really glad I brought Wulfgar back. When I was writing Spine of the World, I came to appreciate making something of what Wulfgar had gone through. When I wrote that book, I sent it to my editor and I said, 'Half the people are going to love this book, and the other half are going to hate it. It is what it is, and there's nothing I can do about it.'\\"Fantasy Book Critic: Dinner with Drizzt: An Interview with R.A. Salvatore In Passage to Dawn, it was explained that yochlol dragged Wulfgar to the Abyss and its master Lolth, who later gave Wulfgar to the demon Errtu, so that the demon would watch over the drow city Menzoberranzan during the Time of Troubles. When Errtu was summoned by a wizard, he escaped and brought Wulfgar with him. He was tortured and humiliated in the hands of the demon. Drizzt and company defeated Errtu and sent him back to the Abyss, but during his time as Errtu's prisoner Wulfgar's mind was almost broken. He later wound up attacking Cattie-brie during a hallucination, an occurrence which caused him much mental anguish.Dusk Before the Dawn: review of \\"The Silent Blade\\" by R.A. Salvatore In an effort to stop the harm he was doing, Wulfgar broke off from the Companions of the Hall, and wandered the North for a time, eventually finding himself at a tavern called the Cutlass, owned by Arumn Gardpeckk. The Spine of the World portrays Wulfgar descending into alcoholism. The barbarian eventually became the bouncer of Arumn's bar and the lover of the barmaid Delly Curtie. Josi Puddles, Arumn's cowardly friend, stole Wulfgar's hammer, fearing that when Arumn decided to fire the huge barbarian, Wulfgar would use the hammer to tear down the bar. Wulfgar was then accused of the attempted murder of Captain Deudermont of the Sea Sprite, with whom he had sailed several years earlier. He was then taken to the Prisoners Carnival, a vicious show run by the Magistrate Jarkheld, where felons (even ones innocent of the crimes accused of) were tortured in various fashions until they admitted to the crimes accused of, so that they might be killed swiftly. Wulfgar and his friend, Morik the Rogue, who had been accused of the same crime, were pardoned by Captain Deudermont, and took to the road after being banished from the city and refusing to once again sail with the Captain. Wulfgar then for a short time tried to, without alcohol, shut out the memories of his time with Errtu, and the horrible tortures he had suffered with him. After an incident in the small fiefdom of Auckney, involving the young king's wife and a lie concocted to save her illegitimate child, Wulfgar and Morik left with a young child, and Wulfgar was finally able to banish his demons without alcohol, after being shown an act of massive courage by the king's wife when she had nothing to gain from the act. He and Morik then headed back to Luskan for a short time. After apologizing to Arumn for his destructive behavior, and to Delly for not returning her feelings, Wulfgar and Morik parted ways and he left Luskan with Delly and their unnamed child at his side. In Sea of Swords, Wulfgar and Delly then traveled to Waterdeep, where Wulfgar took up with Captain Deudermont and the crew of the Sea Sprite in search of the pirate to whom Josie Puddles had sold his warhammer. After giving up his sea-based search, he travelled into the northlands in search of the pirate Sheila Kree. He eventually met up with his old friends, Drizzt and company, whom he had abandoned months earlier and who had thought him dead. With their help (and to a smaller degree Morik's, who had been sleeping with the female wizard of Sheila Kree's crew) he recovered his hammer, Aegis-fang, after facing an entire clan of ogres. Catti- brie then sunk Shelia Kree and her crew with her powerful bow, Taulmaril, as they tried to flee to the sea. When Thibbledorf Pwent and the Gutbuster Brigade arrived, bearing news that Gandalug Battlehammer had died, Wulfgar and his family travelled with his old companions, and the entire clan of Icewind- Dale Battlehammer dwarves, to Mithril Hall so that Bruenor could resume his reign. Sometime afterward, Bruenor decided to look for another lost dwarven homeland called Gauntlgrym, and the dwarf's closest friends accompanied him, along with five hundred dwarves. On their trek through the Spine of the World, the caravan came upon the ruin of the small human settlement Clicking Heels, which had been sacked by a multitude of Orcs and Frost Giants. Later they picked up the only two survivors of an expedition from Citadel Felbarr, which had been similarly destroyed. Bruenor then determined that himself, Drizzt, Wulfgar, Catti-Brie, Regis, and a small detachment of dwarves, would see if other villages in the region had also been sacked. Wulfgar assured Delly that he would rejoin her at Mithril Hall after a short time. During their trek, the group entered the small town of Shallows, a small (approximately 120 people and a local wizard) prosperous community. It was during this time, that while out on patrol, one of Shallows militia teams encountered a large force of Orcs and was slaughtered, with only one survivor managing to escape and hide. The lone survivor then sped back to Shallows and told of the Orc force. When the attack began on the town, Wulfgar was charged with holding an entire section of the towns defensive wall, with Regis, Bruenor and his dwarves, the towns militia holding the rest(Drizzt had been unable to get inside the walls before the assault began), while Withegroo the wizard and the towns archers (Catti- Brie among them) firing over the walls from the top of his tower in the center of the town. He performed admirably, holding the wall against the massive force of 1000 Orcs. Repelling grapplers and sweeping aside those few who crested the wall, Wulfgar was unmovable, even after countless hours when exhaustion began to set in. Unfortunately many townspeople still fell during the first assault, due to the 10 Frost Giants who tirelessly hurled boulders against their defenses. When the first assault ended, it left a third of Shallows defenders dead, and many more orcs. Unfortunately, after the last push by Bruenor and his dwarves to clear out the Orcs from in front of Shallows main gates, he fell unconscious, having sustained many blows that would have felled a lesser Dwarf. During this time, Regis left to try to make his way to one of the Dwarven outposts. When the attack began again, the defenders once again managed to hold their fortifications against the invasion. Unfortunately, Bruenor's second in command, Dagnabbit, fell before it even started, when a giant thrown boulder struck Withegroo's tower where he stood shouting commands to his forces, killing him and three other Dwarves. After the second assault was fended off, the towns walls lay in rubble and many more defenders had fallen, Wulfgar, Catti-Brie, Withegroo and their depleted forces emerged from the rubble and managed to stave off the last attack. After Withegroo cast his last fireball ever and killed many more orcs, Wulfgar stood unmovable against the sea of Orcs that swept against them, and continued to swing his hammer until the press lessened, leaving him and the defenders confused as to why it had stopped. A large wooden idol of Gruumsh One-Eye was then rolled in to the Orc encampment by a caravan of odd Orcs and pack animals. When the idol began to open the orcs crowded around, and were slaughtered by the emerging Gutbusters.. The orcs and pack animals then threw off their druid enchanted cloaks, revealing themselves as Regis, the Bouldershoulder brothers and a small force of Dwarves. In The Two Swords, Delly fell under the powerful will of the sentient sword, Khazid' hea, and was slain by orcs. Townspeople took Colson, without telling Wulfgar. Wulfgar, grieving, is determined to find his adopted daughter. =Return to Icewind Dale= With the release of The Orc King, Wulfgar's quest to get his adopted daughter back continues. In the novel, he and Catti-Brie go to Silverymoon, trying to find Cottie, the woman who took Colson, and through Alustriel, they find that she and the girl had gone to Nesm√©, where many refugees have gone to build new homes. After Cottie, who has lost everything dear to her, finally gives up Colson, Wulfgar finally tells Catti-Brie that he will be taking Colson back to her true mother, and that he will return to Icewind Dale, to become anew in his former tribal life. He says that he wants to find a wife and have a family, and that the comforts of Mithral Hall cannot keep his spirit contented. After returning Colson to her true mother in Auckney, Wulfgar returns to the frigid northlands of Icewind Dale, content in his decision. In the novel Gauntlgrym, it is revealed that Wulfgar lived a very long and healthy life, having several children and grandchildren before he finally died. After his death, he was taken to a special heaven created by the goddess Meilikki, and rejoins Regis, Bruenor and Cattie-brie, but declines Meilikki's offer of a rebirth to instead rejoin his ancestors among the presence of Tempus. It is revealed at the end of The Companions (the first book of the series The Sundering), however, that he changed his mind, and rejoins his old companions for the re-creation of the Companions of the Hall. His story of rebirth and second life is not detailed.  Aegis-fang  Aegis- fang (derived from the mythical shield Aegis) is the weapon of Wulfgar. It was forged for him by his adoptive father Bruenor Battlehammer while he was in servitude of the dwarf king. It was Bruenor's finest creation. Its head is made from pure Mithril with a diamond coating magically adhered during the forging and an adamantite shaft. Its head is engraved with the magical inscriptions of Clangeddin, the dwarven god of battle, as well as the symbols of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, which covers the symbol of Dumathoin, \\"keeper of secrets under the mountain\\". It is a large and heavy, perfectly balanced Dwarven war hammer +5. When thrown at any giant or giant-class monster, that monster is struck dead (although a powerful Frost Giant named Biggrin was able to take the hit, though it gashed the side of his head and dropped the fifteen-foot-tall giant to the floor). Any person not standing over 6'5\\" and with considerable strength will have a hard time wielding it properly, though even someone of lesser strength can feel the flawless balance. It is magically attuned to Wulfgar and will reappear in his hand upon command. Wulfgar has been trained extensively by Drizzt Do'Urden with this weapon. He has used it in two battles against dragons, a shadow dragon named Shimmergloom and a white dragon named Icingdeath, both times ending in victory. He also used it in a battle beside Drizzt Do'Urden and Bruenor Battlehammer against the balor, Errtu, again ending in victory for the companions.

Biography Vaugeois was born in L'Aigle, Orne, on 25 April 1864. He settled in Coulommiers, where he taught philosophy. Initially a republican liberal, Vaugeois even flirted with Marxism in his youth. However he later came to side with the anti-Dreyfus camp. In April 1898, at the height of the Dreyfus affair, the circle of leftist intellectuals to which Vaugeois belonged became supporters of Alfred Dreyfus. Vaugeois and Maurice Pujo left this group. Late in 1898 Vaugeois, Pujo and a few other nationalists who met at the Caf√© de Flore founded the Comit√© d'action fran√ßaise (Committee of French Action). Three of this group, Louis Dausset, Gabriel Syveton and Vaugeois, opposed to the League for the Rights of Man and Dreyfus, launched a petition that attacked √âmile Zola and what many saw as an internationalist, pacifist left-wing conspiracy. In November 1898 their petition gained signatures in the Parisian schools, and was soon circulated throughout political, intellectual and artistic circles in Paris. The decision to create the nationalist anti-Dreyfusard Ligue de la patrie fran√ßaise (League of the French Homeland) was made on 31 December 1898. The Comit√© d'action fran√ßaise was merged into the League, which was led by Jules Lema√Ætre. The circle around Vaugeois quickly became disillusioned with the League, which lacked any clear doctrine. Vaugeois also disagreed with Lema√Ætre's plan to participate in the next legislative elections. The Comit√© d'action fran√ßaise was recreated in April 1899, and the foundational conference of the Action Fran√ßaise movement was held on 20 June 1899 in Paris. In his keynote speech at this meeting Vaugeois declared that the movement stood for \\"anti-Semitic, anti-Masonic, anti-parliamentary and anti-democratic\\" nationalism. Charles Maurras joined the Action Fran√ßaise shortly after. Maurras thought the Bourbon monarchy should be restored, using violence if needed. Maurras convinced Vaugeois to abandon his republican ideals in favour of monarchism. Pujo wrote later, \\"Under the mortal blows of Charles Maurras, the republicanism of each of us succumbed one by one in this year, 1900, which was the year of the hegira for the Action Francaise.\\" In 1899 Vaugeois lost his teaching post after joining Paul D√©roul√®de's half-hearted coup attempt. Vaugeois was a weak politician and a poor speaker and as such did not gain much influence in the new movement, over and above directing the group's eponymous daily paper (which he and Pujo had initially founded). Within the movement he became one of the strongest voices in support of antisemitism. He died in Paris on 11 April 1916, leaving a widow who was several years his junior. Works * (1899).

She is normally invisible and foretells death in her clan by lamenting in the night at a waterfall, stream or Loch, or in a glen or on a mountainside. Unlike the related death portent known as the bean nighe, the caoineag cannot be approached or questioned or be made to grant wishes.Carmichael, Alexander (1900). Carmina Gadelica (Vol. 2). Edinburgh: T. and A. Constable. pp. 240‚Äì1.Mackenzie, Donald (1935). Scottish Folklore and Folk Life. Blackie & Son. pp. 239‚Äì40. The Scottish folklorist Alexander Carmichael in Carmina Gadelica states that she foretells the death of those slain in battle, and that her mourning and weeping cause much anxiety to parents whose sons are in the wars. Before the Massacre of Glencoe, the caoineag of the MacDonalds was heard to wail night after night. Those whose fears were roused by her keening left the glen and escaped the fate of those who remained behind. Fragments of the dirges said to have been sung by the caoineag before the massacre were collected by Carmichael: Little caoineachag of the sorrow Is pouring the tears of her eyes Weeping and wailing the fate of Clan Donald Alas my grief that ye did not heed her cries There is gloom and grief in the mount of mist There is weeping and calling in the mount of mist There is death and danger, there is maul and murder There is blood spilling in the mount of mist Other local names for her include caointeag, caoineachag, caointeachag, and caoidheag. Caointeach The caointeach is another version of this death spirit attached to various clans in Islay. When a death from illness was about to occur she would appear outside the sick person's house wearing a green shawl and begin lamenting at the door. In one account she is said to have been banished from the premises after having been pitied and given a gift of clothing to cover herself, much like traditions of the brownieMacDougall, James and Calder, George (1910). Folk Tales and Fairy Lore in Gaelic and English. Edinburgh: John Grant. p. 215. and the Cauld Lad of Hylton.Briggs, Katharine (1976). An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. pp. 68‚Äì9. . She is sometimes conflated with the bean nighe who haunts desolate streams and washes the clothing of those about to die, but in this context the caointeach is more formidable. If she is interrupted she will strike at a person's legs with her wet linen and the victim will lose the use of them.Briggs 1976, pp. 19‚Äì20. Caointeach is also the spelling alternative given by Edward Dwelly in his dictionary of Scottish Gaelic, where she is defined as a \\"female fairy or water-kelpie\\".

History of the building Prior to refurbishment The line originally opened in 1895, when a wooden \\"chalet\\" type building was erected, including a waiting shelter and staff areas. As a result of increased popularity with the Victorian holidaymakers, a larger, brick-built structure was erected at the turn of the century. The original structure was built entirely of wood, and offered only basic facilities to visitors, and such was the popularity of the tramway that it outlived its usefulness within a few years. A replacement stone structure was installed in 1902 and featured castellated turrets and was more Gothic in appearance. It is the replacement building that serves the railway today but it is in much-simplified format, on the same site as the original building. Early views of the railway station and its environs reveal that there were timber boarded walkways leading to various viewpoints around the terminus. The walkways are now built of concrete, with metal handrails. Coin-operated telescopes were also a feature in the heyday of the line and these were reinstated in 2010. In 1982 a fire gutted the building: it was allowed to burn out owing to the remote location and inaccessibility for the fire brigade. The building was then closed for two years. Owing to the lack of piped water at the summit, each operating day a tram delivers a bowser of drinking water for use in the restaurant. There was also a bar (explaining the one-time title of \\"Summit Hotel\\" featured in marketing). The station features a number of small historical displays around its walls which chart the history and construction of the line; and at one time there was also a display of various sideshows, such as a What the Butler Saw machine; these have been removed in recent times and an extensive refurbishment carried out over the winter of 2010‚Äì11 in readiness for a \\"Victorian Extravaganza\\" event in July. Centenary Caledonia, Laxey Station 1995 To mark the line's centenary in 1995, some remedial work was carried out to the exterior of the building and historical displays were added to the waiting area, many of which remain in place today. Generally speaking, however, the railway station building was in need of much improvement. This began to be addressed when central government funding became available, with the first phase of works commencing in January 2011. The site is also home to a Civil Aviation Authority transmitter mast and station, There are transmitter masts and associated buildings on the summit itself which are viewable from many miles around; they provide transmission for a number of island facilities including telephones, mobile internet and television. In the winter months a small diesel railcar (stored in Laxey when not in use) is used to access the summit; as the overhead power lines for the electric cars are removed at the close of each season to protect them from damage by the cold weather. The most notable event of recent years at the summit was the presence of all six mountain trams at one time for the line's centenary; this is believed to have been the first time this had ever happened. Also, the Manx Northern Railway locomotive Caledonia revisited the summit in 1995 to recreate the events of a century earlier when she had been loaned for use in the construction of the line; this event was a highlight of a year-long festival of events which saw additional services on all of the island's railways. The locomotive reached the summit several times, carrying passengers in a Manx Electric Railway winter saloon trailer. There being a difference of six inches in gauge between the two lines, a third rail was temporarily laid to accommodate these services. Facilities Summit marker The building houses the caf√©, bar, toilets and station master facilities; it remains intact today in a much fragmented form, having once been castellated but following a fire in 1982 these features were never replaced. It replaced an original wooden structure at the turn of the 20th century. The railway's operation being seasonal, the caf√© and bar only open in conjunction with the railway. Marketing It is said that from the summit of Snaefell you can see \\"seven kingdoms at a glance\\" and this legend was emblazoned on the railway's advertising for many years. Those kingdoms are: England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Mann (i.e the Isle of Man), and the kingdoms of Heaven and the sea; sometimes the advertisements have read five or six kingdoms, but more usually the total of seven is cited. =\\"Sunset Dinners\\"= View towards Laxey Valley There was an experimental service in summer 2009 by which visitors could to travel to the summit railway station after the day's routine timetabled services had ceased and enjoy an evening meal in the cafe; this was the first time in the line's history that regular scheduled evening services had been offered. This proved very popular with the public and was repeated over a number of weeks in summer 2010 and demand was such that additional dates were provided supplementing the advertised ones, although some of these additional services offered a buffet service as opposed to a full meal. Over the following winter much refurbishment work was carried out on the building and in 2011 the Sunset Dinner dates were further expanded, to operate once a week at the peak of the summer season. A choice of menus was offered as well as a wine list. The service was expanded in 2011 owing to continued popularity so that these meals are now available on Friday evenings from June to September in addition to the original Wednesdays. =\\"Seven Kingdoms Lunches\\"= Snaefell summit A one-off Easter Lunch was also offered in 2011 to mark the reopening of the facility after refurbishment. In summer 2011 \\"Seven Kingdoms Lunches\\" every Sunday afternoon were introduced. These are similar to the Sunset Dinners; owing to the unpredictable weather on the mountain, these do not have to be booked in advance, although capacity is limited. =\\"Pie in the Sky\\"= In 2010 the \\"Pie in the Sky\\" excursion tram was introduced: a return evening trip from Laxey to the summit where an astronomical talk and stargazing took place prior to refreshments before the return trip. These trips take place at key times of the year to maximize the stargazing opportunities with two sessions: the first trips are at the end of May when there are opportunities to view the rings of Saturn; further trips are at the end of September and start of October for views of the Milky Way and Andromeda. In the event of poor weather and/or visibility an illustrated lecture is also available.

It extends northeast-southwest, some 25 kilometers along the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Etymology In the past, the mountain was called as Slatska Gora until 1445, and only from 1536 as Petrova Gora. The latter name was in honor of the Croatian King Petar Snaƒçiƒá who died in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain. The traditional Croatian historiography erroneously identified the Gvozd Mountain with Petrova Gora, as the more probable location of the battle was in the Kapela mountain pass of central Croatia. Summary It is an old geological formation, which means that it is relatively rich in water and especially in forest vegetation. This also implies a certain mountaineering restraint because it lacks broad visibility, but there is also a large identification of reliefs with numerous significant reefs and deep ravines enriched with numerous streams. It composed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks. The 37 meter high memorial to Mali Petrovac and the abandoned communications tower at Magarƒçevac, which could easily become a hiking pyramid, provide an excellent view of the immediate surroundings, but also to a good part of central Croatia, Gorski Kotar, and Slovenia, and especially Northwest Bosnia. The idea of building a monument on Mali Petrovac was encouraged even after the end of World War II, and on May 6, 1946, the foundation stone was laid. Construction began only after 34 years, in mid 1980, according to the original plans of the Croatian sculptor Vojin Bakiƒá. The monument opened on October 4, 1981. The monument is a masterpiece of monumental commemorative sculpture of its time and highlights the role of Petrova Gora in the antifascist struggle in this region.

This list, however, does not include the work which is best known to us, namely, his attack on the oracles, which is sometimes entitled Against the Oracle (), but the proper title of which seems to have been Detection of Deceivers (, ). =Detection of Deceivers= Long extracts of this work are preserved by Eusebius in his Praeparatio Evangelica.Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, book v. 18-36; book vi. 7. Oenomaus was provoked to write this work having himself been deceived by an oracle.Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, book v. 22. In the extracts available to us, Oenomaus attacks the various legendary accounts of the oracles (especially the Oracle at Delphi), launching a facetious attack on the supposed god (Apollo) behind the oracular pronouncements: > In so great a danger all were looking to you, and you were both their > informant of the future, and their adviser as to present action. And while > they believed you trustworthy, you were sure that they were fools; and that > the present opportunity was convenient for drawing on the simpletons, and > driving them headlong, not only to the schools of sophistry at Delphi and > Dodona, but also to the seats of divination by barley and by wheat-flour, > and to the ventriloquists.Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, book v. 25. His scorn culminates in an attack on the quackery which he sees behind the pronouncements: > And it seems to me that you are no better than the so-called marvel-mongers, > nay not even than the rest of the quacks and sophists. At them, however, I > do not wonder, that they abandon men for pay; but I do wonder at you, the > god, and at mankind, that they pay to be abandoned.Eusebius, Praeparatio > Evangelica, book v. 29. Naturally, not everyone in the Roman world was impressed Oenomaus' thoughts; the Emperor Julian accused him of impiety: > Let not the Cynic be shameless or impudent after the fashion of Oenomaus, a > scorner of all things divine and human: rather let him be, like Diogenes, > reverent towards the divine.Julian, Oration, vi. Oenomaus, like most Cynics, was not an atheist, but he did view the gods as being unconcerned with human affairs. One of his targets was the Stoics who held that Fate governs everything and yet admitted human liberty in how we respond to Fate: > For surely the most ridiculous of all things is this, the mixture and > combination of the two notions, that there is something in men's own power, > and that there is nevertheless a fixed chain of causation.Eusebius, > Praeparatio Evangelica, book vi. 7. This apparent contradiction was at the heart of Oenomaus's attack on oracles, since Apollo at Delphi, far from being able to do his own will, would be compelled by Fate to make his pronouncements. More importantly, oracular pronouncements, according to Oenomaus, if true, remove free-will from human beings.

Informally, the T predicate tells whether a particular computer program will halt when run with a particular input, and the corresponding U function is used to obtain the results of the computation if the program does halt. As with the smn theorem, the original notation used by Kleene has become standard terminology for the concept.The predicate described here was presented in (Kleene 1943) and (Kleene 1952), and this is what is usually called \\"Kleene's T predicate\\". (Kleene 1967) uses the letter T to describe a different predicate related to computable functions, but which cannot be used to obtain Kleene's normal form theorem.  Definition  The definition depends on a suitable G√∂del numbering that assigns natural numbers to computable functions. This numbering must be sufficiently effective that, given an index of a computable function and an input to the function, it is possible to effectively simulate the computation of the function on that input. The T predicate is obtained by formalizing this simulation. The ternary relation T1(e,i,x) takes three natural numbers as arguments. The triples of numbers (e,i,x) that belong to the relation (the ones for which T1(e,i,x) is true) are defined to be exactly the triples in which x encodes a computation history of the computable function with index e when run with input i, and the program halts as the last step of this computation history. That is, T1 first asks whether x is the G√∂del number of a finite sequence ‚ü®xj‚ü© of complete configurations of the Turing machine with index e, running a computation on input i. If so, T1 then asks if this sequence begins with the starting state of the computation and each successive element of the sequence corresponds to a single step of the Turing machine. If it does, T1 finally asks whether the sequence ‚ü®xj‚ü© ends with the machine in a halting state. If all three of these questions have a positive answer, then T1(e,i,x) holds (is true). Otherwise, T1(e,i,x) does not hold (is false). There is a corresponding function U such that if T(e,i,x) holds then U(x) returns the output of the function with index e on input i. Because Kleene's formalism attaches a number of inputs to each function, the predicate T1 can only be used for functions that take one input. There are additional predicates for functions with multiple inputs; the relation :T_k(e, i_1, \\\\ldots, i_k, x), holds if x encodes a halting computation of the function with index e on the inputs i1,...,ik.  Normal form theorem  The T predicate can be used to obtain Kleene's normal form theorem for computable functions (Soare 1987, p. 15; Kleene 1943, p. 52--53). This states there exists a primitive recursive function U such that a function f of one integer argument is computable if and only if there is a number e such that for all n one has :f(n) \\\\simeq U( \\\\mu x\\\\, T(e,n,x)), where Œº is the Œº operator (\\\\mu x\\\\, \\\\phi(x) is the smallest natural number for which \\\\phi(x) holds) and \\\\simeq holds if both sides are undefined or if both are defined and they are equal. Here U is a universal operation (it is independent of the computable function f) whose purpose is to extract, from the number x (encoding a complete computation history) returned by the operator Œº, just the value f(n) that was found at the end of the computation.  Formalization  The T predicate is primitive recursive in the sense that there is a primitive recursive function that, given inputs for the predicate, correctly determine the truth value of the predicate on those inputs. Similarly, the U function is primitive recursive. Because of this, any theory of arithmetic that is able to represent every primitive recursive function is able to represent T and U. Examples of such arithmetical theories include Robinson arithmetic and stronger theories such as Peano arithmetic.  Arithmetical hierarchy  In addition to encoding computability, the T predicate can be used to generate complete sets in the arithmetical hierarchy. In particular, the set : K = \\\\\\\\{ e \\\\mbox: \\\\mbox\\\\exists x T(e,0,x) \\\\\\\\} which is of the same Turing degree as the halting problem, is a \\\\Sigma^0_1 complete unary relation (Soare 1987, pp. 28, 41). More generally, the set :K_{n+1} = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle e, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n\\\\rangle : \\\\exists x T(e, a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n, x)\\\\\\\\} is a \\\\Sigma^0_1 complete (n+1)-ary predicate. Thus, once a representation of the T predicate is obtained in a theory of arithmetic, a representation of a \\\\Sigma^0_1-complete predicate can be obtained from it. This construction can be extended higher in the arithmetical hierarchy, as in Post's theorem (compare Hinman 2005, p. 397). For example, if a set A \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{N}^{k+1} is \\\\Sigma^0_{n} complete then the set :\\\\\\\\{ \\\\langle a_1, \\\\ldots, a_k\\\\rangle : \\\\forall x ( \\\\langle a_1, \\\\ldots, a_k, x) \\\\in A)\\\\\\\\} is \\\\Pi^0_{n+1} complete.

Acheson House is a historic house at 908 West Main St. in Monongahela, Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. Probably built about 1870, it is notable as the home of Edward G. Acheson (1856-1931), the inventor of carborundum, and as the likely site of its invention. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Description and history The Edward G. Acheson House is located west of Monongahela's town center, on the south side of West Main Street roughly midway between 9th and 10th Streets. It is a vernacular 2-1/2 story painted brick building that is not architecturally distinguished. It is roughly L-shaped and covered by a hip roof, with a two-bay gabled projection in front. Its builder and construction date are not known; its styling is suggestive of a c. 1870s construction date. Between 1890 and 1895 the house was the home of inventor Edward G. Acheson (1856‚Äì1931). Acheson, a native of nearby Washington, was a minimally educated, but in 1880 landed a job at the laboratory of Thomas Edison. After being involved in the installation of electricity infrastructure for Edison, he settled in 1890 in Monongahela, where he worked for the local electric utility, and used excess capacity to perform experiments at his home. A series of experiments in 1891 led to invention of carborundum, the name he gave silicon carbide. According to local lore, the experiments were probably conducted in a summer kitchen attached to the back of the house. He moved to Niagara Falls, New York in 1895, to take advantage of the large power station there to develop carborundum production on an industrial scale. He received international recognition for his invention. Carborunudum is a mixture of clay and powdered coke, fused by electric current. It was then‚Äîand for fifty years remained‚Äîthe hardest known artificial substance in the world. It has been used in countless industrial processes, primarily as an abrasive, over the years. Acheson's achievements are all the more remarkable in that he was self- educated and worked independently.\\" In 1953, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker outside the house, noting the historic importance of Acheson's achievements. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and It is designated as a historic residential landmark/farmstead by the Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation.

He married on September 6, 1876 Em√≠lia Ang√©lica de Castro Monteiro (b. Maia, Pedrou√ßos, October 3, 1848), maternal granddaughter of the Viscounts and Counts of Castro, and had issue. The titles of Viscount and Count of Pa√ßo d'Arcos are held by the Correia da Silva family of Portugal. Naval career He excelled in school from an early age, having attended the School for Nobles (Real Col√©gio dos Nobres) and later enrolled in the Portuguese Naval Academy (Escola Naval) at the age of 14, for which royal permission was needed. At 18 the young ensign had his first experience under fire having been given his first command of the schooner Venus whose mission was to apprehend the pirate Apack in the South China Sea. As a young second lieutenant he was appointed Knight of the Military Order of the Tower and Sword (Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada), Portugal's highest decoration awarded for bravery in combat, for his heroics in pursuing and capturing the Spanish slave ship Virgen del Refugio off the coast of Portuguese Guinea in 1864. As a 27-year-old second lieutenant in 1862 the Count of Pa√ßo d'Arcos also commanded the schooner Napier in pursuit of the US confederate pirate ship CSS Alabama in the mid Atlantic near the Azores. He held many other commands, including the brig Pedro Nunes as first lieutenant, which had been King Luis I's personal command before accession to the throne. His appointment was a personal decision of the King with whom he shared a passion for the sea and later a close friendship. Usually such a prestigious command was held by someone of much higher rank and his appointment was proof of the King's confidence in his abilities as a leader of men.\\"Miss√£o Diplom√°tica do Conde Pa√ßo d'Arcos no Brasil ‚Äì 1974\\", preface pp. XXIV-XXX He later commanded the gunboat Zarco and the corvettes Sagres and Estef√¢nia, eventually rising to the top of his career as a naval officer in the Portuguese Royal Navy, having achieved the rank of Vice-Admiral (1895) and Major-General of the Armada (the highest rank of the Portuguese Royal Navy) before his retirement one year prior to his death in 1905. Colonial and diplomatic career The 1stCount of Pa√ßo d'Arcos had a notable colonial career throughout the Portuguese Empire, having reached its pinnacle as Governor- General of Portuguese India (1881).\\"Vice-Reis e Governadores da √çndia Portuguesa ‚Äì 1999\\", pp. 318‚Äì319 He was also Governor of Macao (1876‚Äì1879) and Mozambique (1880), as well as Portugal's first Ambassador to Brazil (1891‚Äì1893) after the former colony abolished the monarchy and sent Emperor Pedro II of Brazil of the House of Bragan√ßa into exile. This prestigious diplomatic post was fraught with difficulties as he represented to the new Brazilian republican government the reigning Portuguese House of Bragan√ßa which their ousted Emperor belonged to.\\"Miss√£o Diplom√°tica do Conde Pa√ßo d'Arcos no Brasil ‚Äì 1974\\" In his diplomatic career he was also Minister Plenipotentiary to China, Japan and the Kingdom of Siam. Civil Governor of Lisbon As Governor of Lisbon in 1890 the Count of Pa√ßo d'Arcos was responsible for ordering the bloody police crackdown after days of rioting followed the issuing of the British Ultimatum regarding Portuguese colonies in Africa. The republican underground in Portugal seized the opportunity of the humiliating British Ultimatum to blame the monarchy and the King for Portugal's loss of prestige. After news of the Ultimatum and Portugal's concessions in Africa (present day Zimbabwe) reached the Portuguese people, Lisbon was thrown into a state of turmoil following massive rioting which threatened to bring down the regime. This was perhaps the first sign of what was to come when 18 years later King Carlos I and the Prince Royal Luis F√≠lipe were assassinated by members of the jacobin Carbon√°ria in downtown Lisbon on February 1, 1908, eventually leading to the republican revolution of October 5, 1910. The Count of Pa√ßo d'Arcos, in his role as Governor and commander of the police in Lisbon, fulfilled his duty without hesitation, ordering the police to use force, which led to his vilification by the republican press of the time.This is clearly seen in the accusations of Basilio Teles in his \\"Do Ultimatum ao 31 de Janeiro (1905)\\". This schoolteacher was a member of the Portuguese Republican Party and allegedly also of the Carbon√°ria, having been exiled for his involvement in the uprising of Porto in 1891. He accused the Count of Pa√ßo d'Arcos of being an homme √† poigne of the Crown and of being a sabreur. Promotion to \\"Grande do Reino\\" Because of his service to the Crown, the Viscount of Pa√ßo d'Arcos was promoted in the Portuguese nobility to a Grandee of Portugal (Grande do Reino)Similar to the Grandees of Spain. In Portuguese nobility, all titles of Count and above (Marquis and Duke) are considered Grandes do Reino. Some lower titles (namely Baron and Viscount) can also be elevated by the King to Grandeza, although this was a rare occurrence. The \\"Grandes do Reino\\" represent the upper strata within the nobility, second only to the Royal Family, and enjoyed special privileges not afforded to the other nobles. when King Carlos I elevated his title to a Countship (Earl in Britain). His only son Henrique was, like his father, a distinguished naval officer and colonial ruler.He was a Captain (Capit√£o de Mar e Guerra) in the Portuguese Navy, Minister of the Colonies (Ministro do Ultramar) and, like his father, Governor of Macao but, unlike his father, also a republican. In keeping with his family's tradition of bravery, Henrique was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Service Order by King George V of Great Britain for his decisive action in saving British warships from being torpedoed by German U-boats off the coast of Cape Verde during World War I. Because of his beliefs and because of the republican revolution implanted by force of arms in 1910, he never claimed officially (encartar) the title of Count of Pa√ßo d'Arcos which nonetheless passed on to his eldest surviving son ‚Äì also named Henrique. Other achievements and distinctions The Count of Pa√ßo d'Arcos was also a member of His Most Faithful Majesty's Council (Conselho de Sua Majestade Fidel√≠ssima), the Chamber of Deputies (C√¢mara dos Deputados) and a Peer of the Realm (Par do Reino) as well as Aide-de-Camp to the King (Ajudante de Campo d'el rei).

A veteran of the country's struggle for independence Sirk later became a leading figure within the right-wing Vaps Movement and an outspoken opponent of the government. Early years A native of rural J√§rvamaa, Sirk came from a humble background, being a farmer's son.Andres Kasekamp, The Radical Right in Interwar Estonia, London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2000, p. 26 As a student he was amongst the first to volunteer to fight against the mobilising Red Army in the Estonian War of Independence.Kasekamp, The Radical Right in Interwar Estonia, p. 10 Following the war Sirk was demobilised and went to the University of Tartu to study law before in 1923 enlisting in the Estonian Army where he was allowed to complete his studies. Leaving the army in 1926 he went to work in the legal firm of Theodor R√µuk, who had briefly served as Estonian Minister of the Interior in 1924. Sirk was soon involved in politics too, initially with the Settlers' Party, a vaguely rightist group led by Ilmar Raamot, whom Sirk knew from both his school and army days.Kasekamp, The Radical Right in Interwar Estonia, p. 55 Vaps Movement Sirk joined Eesti Demobiliseeritud S√µjav√§elaste Liit (Estonian Demobilised Soldiers League) upon its formation in 1921 and its successor movement, Eesti Vabaduss√µjalaste Liit (Union of Participants in the Estonian War of Independence), being appointed deputy chairman of the latter group at its inaugural general meeting on 10 October 1926.Kasekamp, The Radical Right in Interwar Estonia, p. 24 Both of these groups had little ambition beyond being ex-servicemen's associations however Sirk desired a more centralised structure and to this end he established the Eesti Vabaduss√µjalaste Keskliit, or Vaps Movement as it became known, in 1929. Whilst the chairman of the new group was General Ernst P√µdder it was Sirk who drafted its statutes, including an enshrined duty of leadership of the country's youth for the movement, and he also secured a seat on the eight member executive chosen at the first Vaps national congress on 26 January 1930 in Tallinn.Kasekamp, The Radical Right in Interwar Estonia, pp. 24‚Äì25 Sirk's speech at their 1932 conference gave the impetus for a change in direction as he called for a party that could take advantage of citizen's initiative to ensure the transfer to authoritarianism.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 361 Vaps adopted an increasingly paramilitary style that mirrored many of the characteristics of the fascist movements growing elsewhere in Europe and Sirk, who was talented orator and charismatic demagogue, was soon recognised as the movement's driving force.David James Smith, The Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, London: Routledge, 2002, p. 18 The group came close to power in 1933 before being banned by Konstantin P√§ts the following year. The government had claimed that Andres Larka, Sirk and other leading Vaps figures had been preparing to launch a coup although in this instance there was little evidence that the allegations were true.Toivo Miljan, Historical Dictionary of Estonia, Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, 2004, p. 305 Nonetheless Sirk was one of a number of Vaps leaders arrested by the P√§ts regime but he escaped from prison and fled to Finland.Smith, The Baltic States, p. 20 Between 1934 and 1935 he directed Vaps activity from his Finnish base and even became involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the Estonian government with his allies in the Lapua Movement.Kasekamp, The Radical Right in Interwar Estonia, p. 2 Plans for an armed rebellion against P√§ts were put in place but these were discovered in December 1935 by the state security police with the main ringleaders arrested.Smith, The Baltic States, pp. 20‚Äì21 Sirk however was not amongst those arrested as he was able to escape again and this time settled in Luxembourg. Death 120 years since the birth of Artur Sirk. Commemorative stamp. Estonia. Oma Mark 2020. Sirk died after a fall from a hotel window in Echternach in circumstances that have remained suspicious for some commentators to this day. Estonian historians including PustaK. Pusta, Saadiku p√§evik, Geislingen, 1964, vol. 1 and TomingasW. Tomingas, Vaikiv ajastu Eestis, New York, 1961 have argued that the death was an act of defenestration by agents of P√§ts, although local police in Luxembourg stated that it was a suicide. Sirk's funeral was held in Helsinki on 9 October. The eulogy was delivered by Elias Simojoki whilst hundreds of members of Simojoki's Sinimustat youth movement and the Academic Karelia Society were in attendance. August J√§√§ger, an Estonian nationalist in attendance, blamed Sirk's death on the Estonian government, helping to begin the historical debate over the death.Kasekamp, The Radical Right in Interwar Estonia, p. 118 External links * About A.

John Doulton married Jane Duneau, a widow from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, who died on 9 April 1841. They had eight children, including Sir Henry, MP Frederick, Josiah and Alfred. Biography In 1815, soon after John Doulton had completed his apprenticeship as a potter at the Fulham Pottery in London, he invested his life savings of ¬£100 in the Vauxhall Walk pottery of Martha Jones, Lambeth. Her foreman, John Watts, was also taken into partnership and the firm became known as Jones, Watts and Doulton. It specialized in industrial ware, brown stoneware, drain pipes as well as stoneware bottles for chemicals, beer, and other industrial liquids among others. Martha Jones withdrew from the partnership in 1820 and the company moved to new premises in Lambeth High Street in 1826. In 1835 John's 15-year- old son Henry Doulton was taken on as an apprentice. By 1846, Henry had set up an independent Lambeth Pottery which had become the leader in industrial products, particularly sanitation products. Following the retirement of John Watts in 1853, Doulton and Watts merged with Henry's company to become Doulton and Company and was highly recognised for its lines of hand decorated figurines, vases and dinnerware.

Soliman, 506 U.S. 168 (1993), was a case heard before the United States Supreme Court in which the court decided whether a portion of a dwelling unit exclusively used as a principal place of business for any trade or business of a taxpayer would allow a deduction to the taxpayer's income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 280A(c)(1)(A). Soliman was an anesthesiologist who spent thirty to thirty-five hours per week with patients at three different hospitals but none of the hospitals provided him with an office. He used a spare bedroom in his house for contacting patients and surgeons, maintaining billing records, preparing for treatments, and reading medical journals. The Supreme Court denied Soliman's home office deduction setting forth a two consideration test for whether the home was the taxpayer's principal place of business: (1) the relative importance of the activities performed, and (2) time spent at each place. Congress's reaction to this decision was to amend Section 280A(c) in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 so that a home office could meet the \\"principal place of business\\" test if it is the only fixed location where administrative or management activities are performed. This effectively nullified the Supreme Court's decision ruling in the Soliman case.

La Rue applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on October 15, 1990, with a scheduled expiration date of April 15, 1992. The new station was assigned call sign KZDD on June 14, 1991. A few months later, on October 21, 1991, the station was assigned new call sign KSPY. In April 1997, permit holder John K. La Rue filed an application to transfer the KSPY construction permit to the Ukiah Broadcasting Corporation. The transfer was approved by the FCC on June 17, 1997, and the transaction formally consummated on July 15, 1997. After a series of extensions and permit modifications, construction and testing were completed in January 1997 and the station was granted its broadcast license on April 21, 1998. In October 2000, Ukiah Broadcasting Corporation reached a deal to sell KSPY to Keily Miller of Pahrump, Nevada. The FCC approved the sale on February 16, 2001, and the transaction was formally consummated on April 20, 2001. The new owners had the FCC change the station's call sign to KHWG on April 30, 2001. The call sign would be changed again, this time to KHGQ, on September 22, 2003. In May 2005, Keily Miller applied to the FCC to transfer KHGQ to Hilltop Church as a gift. Hilltop Church was a non-profit organization for which Keily Miller served as both trustee and vice-chairman. The FCC granted the transfer on July 18, 2005, and the transaction was formally consummated the same day. Also on that date, the FCC granted the station a modification of its license from commercial to non-commercial educational. On May 4, 2008, the station went dark due to staffing issues and the loss of its main studio facility. The station returned briefly to the air on April 30, 2009. On May 3, 2009, KHGQ went dark once again.

On April 18, 2010, the station reported to the FCC that it had \\"resumed full operation\\" with the broadcast studio at the transmitter site. The station went off the air yet again just two days later on April 20, 2010, due to reported inter-modulation problems with KQNC (88.1 FM). On May 12, 2010, Hilltop Church signed a contract with Sierra Radio, Inc., to transfer the broadcast license for KHGQ in exchange for $50,000. Ownership in Sierra Radio is held 50% by Tom F. Huth and 50% jointly by Gary Katz and Jerrie Rindhal-Katz. The FCC approved the sale of the still-silent station on July 15, 2010, and the deal was formally consummated on September 1, 2010. Also on July 15, 2010, the FCC granted a modification to the station's broadcast license to return KGHQ to commercial operation.

After a successful first summer of concerts, the Aeolian Chamber Players returned in 1965 with 19 students and a cadre of contemporary composers, including Elliott Carter, Meyer Kupferman, George Rochberg, and Morton Subotnick. Thus began the Festival's contemporary music component, which came in time to be known as the Charles E. Gamper Festival, after its chief patron. In 1966, George Crumb made the first of many appearances for the world premiere of his Eleven Echoes of Autumn, 1965. The Bowdoin Festival grew rapidly as a program of the Bowdoin College Music Department through the 70's, 80's, and 90's, changing its name along the way to the Bowdoin Summer Music Festival. In 1997, the Festival became an independent non-profit organization, and in 2004 changed its name to Bowdoin International Music Festival. Kaplan continued as the Festival's director through its 2014 season, when the Festival celebrated its 50th summer as a teaching and presenting institution. In September 2014, David and Phillip Ying, members of the famed Ying Quartet, became the Festival's Artistic Co-Directors.

Active from an early age, he was undecided about full independence and as a result was largely sidelined during the Slovak Republic. Political activity A devout Roman Catholic, he was born in Ru≈æomberok in the Lipt√≥ County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia) and came to politics early as a low-level supporter of Andrej Hlinka.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, pp. 356-357 He would later write a biography of Hlinka, his political idol.Stanislav J. Kirschbaum, A History of Slovakia: The Struggle for Survival, St. Martin's Griffin, 1996, , p. 147 After finishing his education he joined the Slovak People's Party (SPP) and became one of its leading members on the pro-Poland wing. Before long however he would become associated with the Ferdinand ƒéurƒçansk√Ω and the Vojtech Tuka wings of the party. He was elected to parliament in 1935 and, ironically given his early ideas, was chosen to argue against Poland's claims on Slovak territory. Sidor was also commander of the Hlinka Guard and had been touted as a successor to the priest, although this did not happen. He was given the position of Minister for Slovak Affairs by the Czechoslovakian government in 1938, a role which took him away from the radicals of the SPP, allowing Jozef Tiso to take control ahead of him. Wary of Nazi Germany, he rejected a move from Artur Seyss-Inquart to declare independence in 1939, leading to the Nazis concentrating their efforts on Tiso instead.J√∫lius Bartl, Slovak History: Chronology and Lexicon, Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 2002, p. 138 When independence was declared Sidor served as Minister of the Interior for little over a month in 1939 before their pressure forced him out.Kirschbaum, A History of Slovakia, p. 190 Sidor was a strong anti-Semite but nevertheless he had reservations about the Nazis and would later serve in only the very minor role of Minister to the Holy See. From January to March 1939 he also a commission to examine the \\"Jewish question\\" in Slovakia, although nothing came of this initiative and ultimately the issue would be taken over by the Nazis.pp. 196-197 1945 passport validation signed by Karl Sidor who was the Slovakian representative at the Vatican. 1949 stateless travel document used by Karl Sidor's family to leave Italy for Canada.

While India's per capita incomes were low, the average household size and consequent household incomes were higher. India had a total of 247 million households in 2011, with an average of about 4.9 people per household, according to Census of India.Households data for India Census of India 2011, Govt of India (2013) Estimates for average household income and the size of India's middle income households vary by source.

In contrast, Meyer and Birdsall and Tim Light used a different survey and estimated the number of Middle-Income population to be about 70 million in 2009-2010.Meyer and Birdsall, New Estimates of India‚Äôs Middle Class Center for Global Development (2012) These groups, as well as the World Bank, estimated in their 2011 reports that if India's economy continues to grow per projections, India's middle income group would double by 2015 over 2010 levels, and grow by an additional 500 million people by 2025. This would make it, with China, the world's largest middle income market.Kharas, The Emerging Middle Class in Developing Countries Brookings Institution (World Bank Conference, 2011) Compared to other countries, income inequality in India is relatively small as measured by Gini coefficient. India had a Gini coefficient of 32.5 in the year 1999- 2000; India's nominal Gini index rose to 36.8 in 2005, while real Gini after tax remained nearly flat at 32.6. The states of India have significant disparities in their average income. Bihar was by far the poorest in India, and per capita income was low in its neighbouring states, along with Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Manipur, and Nagaland.Comparing Indian states and territories, CEIC, The Economist, (June 2011). The higher income states include Goa, Delhi, Haryana, Sikkim, Telangana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Kerala. Rural-urban gap Gini coefficient of India and other countries according to the World Bank (2018). Higher Gini Index means more income inequality. As in other countries, residents of India's cities have a higher per capita income and standard of living than rural residents. Towns and cities make more than two-thirds of the Indian GDP, even though less than a third of the population live in them. India has a high rate of migration from rural areas to urban areas. A major reason for migration to cities was the Partition of India. More than half of the refugees from Pakistan settled in urban areas such as Delhi. It is estimated that up to 590 million people, or 40% of the Indian population will be living in cities by 2030, much higher than the current 28%. It is also estimated that eight states, including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, and Punjab will have more than half of their total population living in Urban areas by 2030. In India, urban areas have seen a much higher growth rate as compared to rural areas. Despite up to three-fourths of the population living in rural areas, rural areas contribute to only one-third of the national income. The main reason for rural India's poor performance in terms of income is the fact that rural India is mostly dependent on agriculture. The agriculture sector in India grew at a rate of only 1.6% in 2008-09, while the Indian Economy grew at a rate of 6.7%, despite the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. An extremely slow rate of growth in the agriculture sector of the Indian economy has serious implications for the rural-urban divide, both in terms of income and GDP. Some estimates say that the average income of a person living in an urban area may be up to 4 times higher than that of a person living in a rural area. The rising levels of urbanisation in India is a major reason for the rising levels of income disparity in the country. Bridging the Urban-Rural Gap In India, the government has taken steps to bridge the urban-rural gap. This includes setting up the Council for Advancement of People's Action and Rural Technology (CAPART) by the Ministry of Rural Development. CAPART helps in providing assistance to various organisations which help in developmental activities. There is a constantly widening rift between rural and urban India, not only in terms of income but other social measures. There is an urgent need to strengthen the agriculture sector in India, bring about reforms in labour laws, and provide education. The Economic Survey of India 2007 by OECD concluded About 27.5% of the population was living below the poverty line in 2004-2005.Poverty estimates for 2004-05 , Planning commission, Government of India, March 2007.

History Moving targets were an innovation used by European impalement artists in the 1930s. Husband and wife act The Gibsons, from Germany, have been credited with introducing the Wheel of Death into the US in 1938, when they featured in Ringling Bros, and Barnum & Bailey's shows at Madison Square Garden.Stan Brion, \\"Foreword\\", in Adamovich, Heil & Schollenberger, A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant, Turnshare (London, 2005), , p.ix Variations There are variations in the exact configuration of \\"wheels\\": in some the assistant is positioned with their arms at their sides while in others the assistant is spreadeagled.

In 1408, he went to China and died in Nanjing at the age of 28, leaving a 4-year-old prince named Xiawang (ÈÅêÊó∫). He was buried in Nanjing. His tomb is now a tourist attraction. From the fact that Abdul Majid Hassan died in 1408 at the age of 28, we can surmise he was born in 1380.

The machine in its bare form is equivalent to a deterministic finite automaton in computational power, and therefore can only parse a regular language.  Theory  We define a standard Turing machine by the 9-tuple M = (Q, \\\\Sigma, \\\\Gamma, \\\\vdash, \\\\\\\\_, \\\\delta, s, t, r) where * Q is a finite set of states; * \\\\Sigma is the finite set of the input alphabet; * \\\\Gamma is the finite tape alphabet; * \\\\vdash \\\\in \\\\Gamma - \\\\Sigma is the left endmarker; * \\\\\\\\_ \\\\in \\\\Gamma - \\\\Sigma is the blank symbol; * \\\\delta : Q \\\\times \\\\Gamma \\\\rightarrow Q \\\\times \\\\Gamma \\\\times \\\\\\\\{L,R\\\\\\\\} is the transition function; * s \\\\in Q is the start state; * t \\\\in Q is the accept state; * r \\\\in Q, ~ r e t is the reject state. So given initial state q reading symbol a, we have a transition defined by \\\\delta(q,a)=(q_2,a_2,d) which replaces a with a_2, transitions to state q_2, and moves the \\"read head\\" in direction d (left or right) to read the next input. In our 2DFA read-only machine, however, a=a_2 always. This model is now equivalent to a DFA. The proof involves building a table which lists the result of backtracking with the control in any given state; at the start of the computation, this is simply the result of trying to move past the left endmarker in that state. On each rightward move, the table can be updated using the old table values and the character that was in the previous cell. Since the original head-control had some fixed number of states, and there is a fixed number of states in the tape alphabet, the table has fixed size, and can therefore be computed by another finite state machine. This machine, however, will never need to backtrack, and hence is a DFA. = Variants = Several variants of this model are also equivalent to DFAs. In particular, the nondeterministic case (in which the transition from one state can be to multiple states given the same input) is reducible to a DFA. Other variants of this model allow more computational complexity. With a single infinite stack the model can parse (at least) any language that is computable by a Turing machine in linear time.Computational Complexity by Wagner and Wechsung, section 13.3 (1986, ) In particular, the language {anbncn} can be parsed by an algorithm which verifies first that there are the same number of a's and b's, then rewinds and verifies that there are the same number of b's and c's. With the further aid of nondeterminism the machine can parse any context-free language. With two infinite stacks the machine is Turing equivalent and can parse any recursive formal language. If the machine is allowed to have multiple tape heads, it can parse any language in L or NL, according to whether nondeterminism is allowed.Computational Complexity by Wagner and Wechsung, section 13.1 (1986, )  Applications  A read-only Turing machine is used in the definition of a Universal Turing machine to accept the definition of the Turing machine that is to be modelled, after which computation continues with a standard Turing machine. In modern research, the model has become important in describing a new complexity class of Quantum finite automata or deterministic probabilistic automata.

He served as Master of the Buckhounds under Lord Melbourne from 1834 to 1835. Background and education Chesterfield was the son of Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield, and his wife, Lady Henrietta, daughter of Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath, and was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. Political career He succeeded his father in the earldom in 1815 at the age of ten and later took his seat on the Tory benches in the House of Lords. He served briefly in the Tory administration of Sir Robert Peel as Master of the Buckhounds from December 1834 to April 1835 and was sworn of the Privy Council in December 1834. Horse racing Lord Chesterfield had a great passion for horse racing and spent most of his early years indulging in that pursuit. Although he had some success on the turf, winning the Oaks twice, his victories were not frequent enough to pay for the large string of horses he had in training or to finance his lifestyle of lavish party giving and gambling. His racing colours of red cap and jacket with blue sleeves were also carried to victory by Tom Olliver in the 1843 Grand National aboard his horse Vanguard.www.tbheritage.com The Grand National In 1840, after the success of Crucifix he decided to give up his expensive mode of living and retire to Bretby Hall. He did construct a gallop of two miles to exercise his horses. Many eminent people visited Bretby to try out their horses or for shooting in Bretby Park. Among them were the Earl of Wilton, the Earl of Londesborough, Lord Newport and Sir Henry des Voeux. The best jockeys also came to Bretby.

Anne Elizabeth Weld-Forester in 1830. They had one son and one daughter. Their daughter Lady Evelyn Stanhope (1834‚Äì1875) was the first wife of Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon. Lord Chesterfield died in June 1866, aged 61, and was succeeded in the earldom by his only son, George. The Countess of Chesterfield died in July 1885, aged 82. Like her sister Selina, Countess of Bradford, she was an intimate friend of Benjamin Disraeli. After they had both been widowed Disraeli is said to have proposed to her, but she declined on the ground that people over seventy just look foolish when they decide to marry. Some of their friends thought that she refused him because she believed that he cared more for her sister Selina.Pearson, Hesketh Dizzy- the life and personality of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield Harper Collins New York 1951 p.243 References External links * Category:1805 births Category:1866 deaths Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom George Category:Presidents of the Marylebone Cricket Club Category:Masters of the Buckhounds Category:Earls of Chesterfield Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:People educated at Eton College ","title":"George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield"},{"id":"14103673","text":"Lairo Water is a surface water body known as an ayre situated on the western coast of Shapinsay in the Orkney Islands.

High-rise syndrome is a veterinary term for injuries sustained by a cat falling from a building, typically higher than two stories ().  Injuries sustained by cats falling  Common injuries sustained in cats after a fall include: * Broken bones, most likely the jawbone as the cat's chin hits the ground; a broken jawbone and shattered teeth are the classic signs of a cat having sustained injuries in a fall. * Injuries to the legs: joint injury; ruptured tendons; ligament injury; broken legs. * Internal injuries, especially to the lungs Studies done of cats that have fallen from 2 to 32 stories, and are still alive when brought to a veterinarian clinic, show that the overall survival rate is 90 percent of those treated. In a study performed in 1987 it was reported that cats who fall from less than six stories, and are still alive, have greater injuries than cats who fall from higher than six stories. It has been proposed that this might happen because cats reach terminal velocity after righting themselves (see below) at about five stories, and after this point they are no longer accelerating, which causes them to relax, leading to less severe injuries than in cats who have fallen from less than six stories. Another possible explanation for this phenomenon is survivorship bias, that cats who die in falls are less likely to be brought to a veterinarian than injured cats, and thus many of the cats killed in falls from higher buildings are not reported in studies of the subject. In a more recent study, it was observed that cats falling from higher places suffered more severe injuries than those experiencing shorter drops.  Righting  During a fall from a high place, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and its flexibility.Falling Cats This is known as the cat's \\"righting reflex\\". The minimum height required for this to occur in most cats (safely) would be around . However, it has been argued that, after having reached terminal velocity, cats would orient their limbs horizontally such that their body hits the ground first. A 1987 study speculated that this is done after falling five stories to ensure the cat reaches a terminal velocity by thereafter relaxing and spreading their bodies to increase drag.A 1987 study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association of 132 cats that were brought into the New York Animal Medical Center after having fallen from buildings.  Why cats fall from high places  Cats have a natural fondness for heights. If a cat is distracted by potential prey, or if it falls asleep, it can fall. If this were to occur in a tree, for example, the cat would often be able to save itself by grabbing on with its claws. Many building materials such as concrete and painted metal do not allow a cat to grip successfully.

The event  A ceremony was being held to re-open a sugar factory as part of a plan to improve and build the economy in the northeastern Baghlan province. Large groups of people, including children and elderly people were lined up to assist in the inauguration of the facility. It is widely believed that the blast was caused by a bomb full of ball-bearings. It is unlikely that a suicide attacker could cause such a massive carnage.  Fatalities  At least 75 people were killed or wounded severely in the massive bombing; the Associated Press reports that 64 were killed while a hospital in Baghlan mentioned that 90 bodies were sent to the hospital with 50 others wounded. An Afghan television station reported that at least 100 were killed.CTV.ca  Bombs targeting Afghan lawmakers kill dozens Six members of the Afghan parliament were killed in the blast, including key opposition figures. The lawmakers killed in the bombing were former Commerce Minister Sayed Mustafa Kazemi, the prominent private sector representative Hajji Muhammad Arif Zarif, as well as Abdul Mateen, Al Hajj Sahib Abdul-Rahman, Nazuk Mir Sarfaraz and Sebghatullah Zaki.

A spokesperson for the Interior Ministry blamed the attack on \\"the enemy of Afghanistan, the enemy of the people of Afghanistan\\" referring to the militant group. Following the bombing, a Taliban official dismissed any responsibility of the group for the incident.

It became well known internationally after several reports about the institution for children with physical and mental disabilities. In 2007, the BBC showed the film \\"Bulgaria's Abandoned Children\\". The British public were deeply disturbed and started a petition to the Prime Minister to intervene and put pressure on EU institutions and the Bulgarian government to solve the problem. Many British, Bulgarian and international charities intensified their work effort to solve the problem with abandoned children in the country. The case of Mogilino resembles the campaign publicising the conditions in the Romanian orphanages in the early 1990s. Bulgaria has been criticised for having one of the highest numbers of children in state institutional care in the EU. On 30 January 2008 Bulgarian National Television presented its answer to the BBC documentary in the form of a documentary called Dom (House or Home). \\"It is not right that the whole of Europe be antagonised against Bulgaria because of a well- manipulated and skilfully edited documentary on a home being prepared to close down, such as Mogilino,‚Äù the makers said. On the same day, Bulgarian Members of the European Parliament signed a declaration in which they called for \\"a common European policy on the upbringing and education of underprivileged children.\\" On 22 February 2008 Labour and Social Policy Minister Emilia Maslarova repeated a promise that the Mogilino home, along with six similar homes, would be closed . At the initiative of Irish member of the European Parliament Kathy Sinnott, Kate Blewett's documentary was screened in the European Parliament on 4 March 2008. On 27 June 2008 The Sofia Echo reported that some of the children from the Mogilino home had been relocated to other homes around Bulgaria, and that the Agency for Social Assistance and UNICEF were working, ultimately, to close the home. The Mogilino Children's Institution finally closed on 1 October 2009, following further pressure from the BBC and the EU.

These include the enigmatic, antelope- like saola, the African and Asiatic buffalos, and a clade that consists of bison and the wild cattle of the genus Bos. Not only are they the largest members of the subfamily Bovinae, they are the largest species of their family Bovidae. The largest species are the gaur (Bos gaurus) and wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), both weighing between 700 and 1,200 kilograms.Schaller, G. B., Simon, N. M. (1969). The endangered large mammals of Asia. In: Holloway, C. W. (ed.) IUCN Eleventh Technical Meeting. Papers and Proceedings, 25‚Äì28 November 1969, New Delhi, India. Volume II. IUCN Publications new series No. 18, Morges, Switzerland. pp. 11‚Äì23.Owen-Smith, R. N. (1992). Megaherbivores: the influence of very large body size on ecology. Cambridge University Press. In addition to their massive size, they can be differentiated from other bovines and bovids with their short, thick legs and smooth horns presented in both sexes. Bovins and humans have had a long and complex relationship. Five of seven species have been successfully domesticated, with one species (cattle) being the most successful member of their lineage. Domesticated shortly after the last Ice Age, Op. cit. in there are at least 1.4 billion cattle in the world. Domestic bovins have been selectively bred for beef, dairy products, leather and serve as working animals. However many species of wild cattle are threatened by extinction due to habitat loss to make room for cattle farming as well as unregulated hunting. Some are already extinct like the aurochs, two subspecies of European bison and perhaps the kouprey. Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is critically endangered. Etymology In 1821 British zoologist John Edward Gray described the family, subfamily and tribe Bovidae, Bovinae, and Bovini respectively. The word \\"Bovini\\" is the combination of the Latin prefix bos (written as bov-, which is Late Latin from bovinus) and the suffix -ini refers to their ranking as a tribe. Systematics =Placement within Bovinae= The wild cattle belong to the subfamily Bovinae, which also includes spiral- horned antelope of the tribe Tragelaphini and two aberrant species of Asian antelope, four-horned antelope and nilgai, which belong to the tribe Boselaphini. The relationship between the tribes varies in research concerning their phylogeny. Most molecular research supports a Bovini and Tragelaphini subclade of Bovinae. There are also some morphological support for this, most notably both groups have horn cores with a pedicle. =The fossil record= The earliest known wild cattle originated from Asia south of the Himalayas during the Late Miocene. This is not only supported by the fossil record but also the fact that south Asia has the highest diversity of wild cattle on planet, as well as the fact the southeast Asian saola is the basal most of the living species. At some point after the divergence of the three subtribes around 13.7 million years ago, bovins migrated into Africa from Asia where they have diversified into many species.Bienvenido Mart√≠nez-Navarro, Juan Antonio P√©rez-Claros, Maria Rita Palombo, Lorenzo Rook, and Paul Palmqvist: \\"The Olduvai buffalo Pelorovis and the origin of Bos\\". Quaternary Research Volume 68, Issue 2, September 2007, Pages 220‚Äì226. online During the Pliocene epoch some bovins left Africa and entered Europe, where they have evolved into hardy, cold-adapted species. During the Ice Age ancestors of the bison had colonized North America from Eurasia over the Bering Land Bridge in two waves, the first being 135,000 to 195,000 years ago and the second being 21,000 to 45,000 years ago.An Alaska volcano and DNA reveal the timing of bison's arrival in North America, Alaska Dispatch News, Yereth Rosen, March 27, 2017.

According to the fossil record and the molecular work, Bubalina and Bovina have diverged from one and another from a common ancestor around 13.7 million years ago in the Late Miocene. The number of taxa and their evolutionary relationships with each other has been debated, mainly as there is several evidence of ancient hybridization events that occurred among the various species of wild cattle, obstructing any evidence of their relationships. Below is the taxonomy of extant genera that are classified as members of the tribe Bovini (more information regarding the species taxonomy is explained more in- depth in their respective subtribe articles): *Tribe Bovini (Gray, 1821) ** Subtribe Pseudorygina (Hassanin & Douzery, 1999) *** Genus Pseudoryx (Dung et al., 1993) ‚Äì Saolas ** Subtribe Bubalina (R√ºtimeyer, 1865) *** Genus Syncerus (Hodgson, 1847) ‚Äì African buffalos *** Genus Bubalus (Hamilton-Smith, 1827) ‚Äì Anoas and the wild water buffalos ** Subtribe Bovina (Gray, 1821) *** Genus Bison (Hamilton-Smith, 1827) ‚Äì Bison (might be part of Bos instead) *** Genus Bos (Linnaeus, 1758) ‚Äì Taurine and Asiatic cattle Natural history =General description= A male gaur is among the largest species of their lineage. Wild cattle are usually massive bovids that are stout-bodied with thick, short legs. Some species can reach impressive body-sizes such as wild water buffalo, wild yak, American bison, European bison, and gaur which can weigh between 700 and 1,200 kilograms and these species can attain a shoulder height more than 1.9 meters. There are some breeds of domestic cattle that can be even larger than both wild species, one of them being the Chianina, bulls of which can weigh from 1,200 to 1,500 kilograms and reach a similar height to the gaur.Chianina (in Italian). Atlante delle razze bovine ‚Äì Razze da carne. Accessed November 2017.Daniele Bigi, Alessio Zanon (2008). Atlante delle razze autoctone: Bovini, equini, ovicaprini, suini allevati in Italia (in Italian). Milan: Edagricole. . There are, however, several species of buffalo that live on the various islands in Indonesia are dwarf species, such as the tamaraw and the anoa, that weigh between 200 and 300 kilograms. Furthermore, not all species of bovin look like cattle, such as the saola which looks more like antelope (a fact that caused some confusion among bovid biologists). What all bovins or wild cattle do have in common is both sexes have the presents of smooth horns, instead of annulated horns seen in most other bovids. In bovinans the horns are round, while in bubalinans they are flattened. Like the spiral-horned antelopes there is extreme sexual dimorphism in bovins, though it is emphasis on the body size and the size of the horns. Males are significantly larger than the females, which most of their features are exaggerated with massive humps, large necks, and in some species the presence of a dewlap. Males and females exhibit sexual monochromatism (with the exception of the banteng, where males are a dark chestnut while females are just chestnut), though the male coloration hues are darker than the females. Coloration can be uniform or with some white markings, from black to brown. =Distribution and ecology= American bison, a species that lives on the open plains of North America. The wild species of bovins are found in North America, Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa, though domesticated species or variants have a global cosmopolitan range with the help of humans. With the exception of the open-plains dwelling American bison and the montane-dwelling wild yak, all species of wild cattle inhabit wooded or forested areas with some clearings. The reason is because most species require a lot of roughage (often tall grass) in their diet and a lot of water to drink. In addition they are less efficient eaters than smaller herbivores, as they cannot selectively forage on relatively short grass due their stiff, immobile upperlips. They commonly wallow in mud and water in swamps, especially with water buffalo. Forest-dwelling live in deciduous and tropical forests. With their large body- size, wild cattle have few natural predators aside from humans. Still they are often prey to crocodiles, big cats, spotted hyenas, dholes, and wolves. It is often the young and the weak that are commonly selected by these predators. =Behavior and reproduction= Water buffalo ramming against each other using the weight of their heads and their horns. Wild cattle are very social animals, which they accumulate into large herds, with some individual sizes that can go into the hundreds. Usually these herds consisted of females and their young, although in some species there are occasionally bachelor males among them. Generally the larger and more experienced males tend to be solitary, though in the breeding season mixed-herds occur. There is a strict hierarchy among males based on size dominance. All species of bovin are polyandrous. During the rutting period males engage in ramming against each other in order to obtain the breeding rights for females as well as territory. The gestation period occurs once the female has been inseminated from the male successfully. In most species it lasts approximately nine to ten months. They only give birth to a single calf. Once the young are born, they won't wean until they are around six to 10 months depending on the species. Females of most species sexually mature by four years while for males it is seven years. =Genetics and hybridization= A beefalo and her calf. The chromosome number varies by species, and sometimes even by subspecies, which warrants further research for taxonomic purposes. The ancestral Y chromosome was probably a small acrocentric, but evolved into several distinct characteristics. The subtribe Bubalina have the acquisition of X-specific repetitive DNA sequence on their Y chromosomes; Bos has derivative metacentric Y chromosomes, and share the presence of shared derivative submetacentric X chromosomes with Bison. Below is a listing of the diploid number 2n of selected species as follows: * Saola: 2n = 50 * Forest buffalo: 2n = 54 * Cape buffalo: 2n = 52 * Lowland anoa: 2n = 48 * Water buffalo: 2n = 48 * Gaur: 2n = 58 * Banteng: 2n = 60 * Yak: 2n = 60 * European bison: 2n = 60 * American bison: 2n = 60 * Cattle: 2n = 60 Bovin hybridization is most common in the subtribe Bovina, the most well known of these is the beefalo (a cross between cattle and American bison). Most of these hybrids are deliberate from humans wanting to improve the quality of various cattle breeds (in particular for beef production). All bovinan hybrids produce sterile males and fertile females following Haldane's rule. In addition for the agricultural purposes, bovin hybridization was used in the past to save several species such as the American bison in the past. This has caused problems for wild cattle conservation as hybrids pollute the genetic diversity of genetically-pure animals. Bovin hybridization was also a major factor behind the evolution of Bovini, as some species have evidence of ancient hybridization in their genome.

It stars Ali MacGraw, Peter Weller and Alan King, and was also Myrna Loy's final film. The screenplay by Jay Presson Allen, adapted from her novel, won her the David di Donatello Award for Best Screenplay of a Foreign Film. To date, this is MacGraw's last leading role in a film. Plot Max Herschel, the married, wealthy, vulgar, egotistical, middle-aged head of a corporate empire, is satisfied with the somewhat casual love/hate relationship he shares with his mistress and protegee, television producer \\"Bones\\" Burton, just as it is, but she wants a more serious commitment. The young woman attempts to extricate herself from the affair‚Äîor perhaps force her lover into taking the next, more permanent step‚Äîby dating a younger man, off-off-Broadway playwright Steven Routledge. Max, however, is not a man to accept defeat in any of his endeavors, and he retaliates with a vengeance. The two engage in an escalating battle of wits, with Max discovering money can't resolve everything when he is outsmarted by business rival Seymour Berger and his grandson Mike. It leads to a comic fight between Max and Bones at New York's Bergdorf Goodman. Cast (in alphabetical order) * Judy Kaye as the Baby * Alan King as Max Herschel * Myrna Loy as Stella Liberti * Ali MacGraw as Bones Burton * Joseph Maher as Dr. Coleson * Dina Merrill as Connie Herschel * Tony Roberts as Mike Berger * Peter Weller as Steven Routledge * Keenan Wynn as Seymour Berger Production The film features the last motion picture performance of Myrna Loy, who plays Herschel's confidential secretary. Interiors of the Warner Bros. release were filmed at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York, with Manhattan exteriors (and the scene inside Bergdorf Goodman) shot on location. Critical reception In his review in Time, Frank Rich stated, \\"After a brisk 20 minutes, the movie loses its assurance and sense of purpose. Indeed, Jay Presson Allen's screenplay reels around like a drunken sailor. From moment to moment, Just Tell Me is a somber and confusingly plotted story of corporate power struggles, a syrupy account of a love triangle, and a sloppy satire of show business...There are still some bright moments, but they are separated by flaccid, poorly connected scenes that go nowhere at great length. The few high points belong to King and MacGraw. [He] is too much of a pussycat to convey the hero's toughness, but he delivers Allen's best sallies with crackling speed...Though MacGraw is no comedian, she is animated and playful for the first time in memory.\\"Time review References External links  * Category:1980 films Category:American films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1980 romantic comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:Films directed by Sidney Lumet Category:Films scored by Charles Strouse Category:1980 comedy films ","title":"Just Tell Me What You Want"},{"id":"14104090","text":"The Tireu is a right tributary of the river Gurghiu in Romania.

Critics had sometimes dismissed the exaggerated features of Hogarth's characters as caricature and, by way of an answer, he produced this picture filled with characterisations accompanied by a simple illustration of the difference between characterisation and caricature. Picture Hogarth's earlier pictures had come under fire from critics for portraying characters in an exaggerated fashion, by reflecting their morality directly in their features, clothes and surroundings. In his book on art, The Analysis of Beauty, Hogarth claimed that the critics had branded all his women as harlots and all his men as caricatures, and complained: To rectify what he saw as an egregious mistake on the part of his critics, and being \\"perpetually plagued, from the mistakes made among the illiterate, by the similitude in the sound of the words character and caricatura\\",Hogarth pp.60‚Äì61 he designed the subscription ticket for Marriage √†-la-mode to clearly illustrate their error. Untitled at the time of issue, it is now known as Characters and Caricaturas or just Characters Caricaturas. At the foot of the picture, Hogarth illustrated the difference between characterisation and caricature by reproducing three character figures from the works of Raphael, and four caricatures: Due Filosofi from Annibale Carracci; a head originally by Pier Leone Ghezzi, but here copied from Arthur Pond's Caricatures; and a Leonardo da Vinci grotesque reproduced from the French T√™tes de Charact√™res.Paulson p.122 The images from Raphael are easy to identify as being from his Cartoons (even if they were not labelled Cartons Urbin Raphael Pinx below) but John Ireland commented that the originals' \\"grandeur, elevation and simplicity are totally evaporated\\" in Hogarth's rendering.Hogarth p.214 Hogarth also added a line drawing in the space above the second caricature to indicate the simplicity with which caricatures can be produced. Above this demonstration, he filled the remaining space with 100 profiles of \\"characters\\", which clearly show his work has more in common with the work of Raphael than the caricatures produced by the other Italian artists. Hogarth later wrote that he was careful to vary the features of these heads at random to prevent any of the portraits being identified as a real individual, but the sheer number of profiles inevitably meant this was not entirely successful, since \\"a general character will always bear some resemblance to a particular one\\". Though Hogarth claimed in the inscription to The Bench that \\"there are hardly any two things more different\\" than character and caricature, modern commentators suggest that his division of the category of comic portraiture, if not artificial, was at least innovative: Hogarth invented the categories merely to be able to place himself in a line of artistic succession that descended from Raphael, and to distance himself from the caricaturists of his day‚Äîsuch as Arthur Pond‚Äîwho, despite lacking artistic training, were tackling much the same subject matter that Hogarth was himself addressing.Lynch pp.62‚Äì3 Below the picture, Hogarth added a rider: \\"For a farthar Explanation of the Difference Betwixt Character & Caricature See ye Preface to Joh. Andrews\\". Here he is referring to his friend Henry Fielding's 1742 work, Joseph Andrews, in which Fielding explains that a character portrait requires attention to detail and a degree of realism, while caricature allows for any degree of exaggeration. Fielding positions himself as a \\"Comic Writer\\" and Hogarth as a \\"Comic Painter\\", and dismisses the caricaturists as he dismisses the writers of burlesques.Mayer p.89 Fielding wrote in defence of Hogarth in the preface: On the original subscription ticket, a further section detailed the forthcoming issue of Marriage √†-la-mode with details of its content, price and issue date. A copy of the ticket, finished with Hogarth's signature, a wax seal and an acknowledgement of receipt from a \\"Mr McMillan\\" is held by the British Library. In 1822, the print was re-issued in its own right, minus the subscription details, by William Heath.

Note on the Texts, p. 999. It tells the story of a drinking man overseeing his yard-sale. The reader gets the feeling that he may be selling all his possessions, looking to start life anew. A young couple stops by to select furniture for their new apartment. They haggle a little over prices and buy a TV and a bed. The drinking man tells the young girl to put a record on. When the music begins the man asks the couple to dance. Uncomfortably, they comply. Then the drinking man dances with the young girl, and she says to him: \\"You must be desperate or something.\\" Several weeks later, the young girl is telling her friends about the man at his yard-sale. She mocks the record- player and records he gave them, saying: \\"Will you look at this shit?\\" The story ends with her trying to make sense of the man's situation before quitting her wondering altogether.

The day after Christmas, Burt comes back to Vera's house to explain away his poor, erratic behavior from the day before. Christmas Day, Burt put too many logs in the fire which could've burned the place down. On his way out to make room for Vera's boyfriend Charlie, who is to arrive after six, Burt steals a couple pies from the kitchen counter. On the 26th Vera does not want to talk to Burt; she doesn't have the time, she has plans. Burt apologizes but Vera does not think it's very sincere. Burt notices cigarette butts that are not Vera's regular brand collected in the ashtray, \\"their ashtray,\\" and feels out of place. While Vera is the bathroom the phone rings and she shouts at Burt to answer it. It's a call for Charlie and Burt responds curtly, saying he's \\"not here\\" before leaving the phone off the hook. Vera comes back into the kitchen, and it's clear she cannot tolerate Burt sticking around. The phone rings again (it's for Charlie again) and Vera says she'll answer it from the bedroom. Instead of hanging up when Vera commands, Burt takes a knife from the cabinet and cuts the cord in two. Vera realizes what's happened and yells for Burt to leave, saying she'll get a restraining order. Burt leaves calmly and, as he drives away in his car holding the ashtray, he is deludedly positive that in a few weeks they'll have a \\"serious talk\\" and get back together.

In a moment of fury, L.D. throws a pickle jar through the window, shattering the glass. Maxine gives L.D. an ultimatum: he must pack his things and go or she'll call the police. L.D. starts packing, stuffing not only his belongings into his suitcase but also vindictively taking womanly toiletries he could make no use of. Taking one last look around, about to leave for good, L.D. says he has one more thing to tell his wife and daughter but, suddenly inarticulate, he is unable to put what he feels into words.

Plot The story is about four friends‚ÄîMel, Teresa (Terri), Laura, and Nick. The setting is Mel's house, around a table with a bucket of ice in the middle. A bottle of gin is inside it. They soon start to talk about love (as the title suggests). Terri has had an abusive relationship; the abuse, she says, derives from love. Ed, Terri's former abusive boyfriend, \\"loved her so much he tried to kill her.\\" Ed would beat Terri; he dragged her around the living room by her ankles knocking her into things along the way. Terri believed that Ed loved her and his abuse was his way of showing it. No matter what Terri said, Mel refused to believe that was \\"love\\". Ed also stalked Mel and Terri and called Mel at work with threatening messages. At one point, Mel was so scared he bought a gun and made out a will. Mel even wrote to his brother in California, saying that \\"if something happened to him\\" to look for Ed. Terri's abusive boyfriend eventually committed suicide after two attempts (as Terri sees it, another act of love). Ed's first attempt at suicide was when Terri had left him. Ed had drunk rat poison, but was rushed to the hospital where he was saved. In Ed's second, successful attempt he shot himself in the mouth. Someone heard the shot from Ed's room and called the manager. Terri and Mel argued about whether she could be in the hospital bedroom with him when he died. Terri won and was with Ed as he died; as Terri put it, \\"He never came up out of it.\\" Soon afterward, Mel begins a story about an elderly couple struck by a drunk driver, a teenager who was pronounced dead at the scene. The couple survived the car accident because they were wearing seat belts. Mel was called into the hospital that night just as he sat down to dinner. Once he arrived, he saw how badly the elderly couple had been injured. He said that they had \\"multiple fractures, internal injuries, hemorrhaging, contusions, and lacerations.\\"Ann Charters, The Story and Its Writer: An Introduction to Short Fiction. The couple were in casts and bandages from head to toe. Mel's point in telling the story was the husband's consternation when the couple was moved into the intensive care unit. Mel would visit the couple daily, and when he put his ear to the husband's mouth-hole, the latter told Mel he was upset because he could not see his wife through his eye-holes. Mel would stray from the topic with more talk about Ed, his personal thoughts about love, hatred toward his ex- wife, and life as a knight. Mel felt even though one loves a person, if something were to happen to them, the survivor would grieve but love again. After finishing the second bottle of gin, the couples discuss going to dinner, but no one makes any moves to proceed with their plans. Publication history Earlier version Carver's original draft of the story \\"Beginners\\" was heavily edited by Gordon Lish, who cut out nearly half of Carver's story, adding in details of his own. Carver's original draft, released by his widow Tess Gallagher and published in a December 2007 issue of the New Yorker, reveals the extensive edits. For instance, the character Mel was originally named Herb, and the abusive boyfriend, renamed Ed by Lish, was originally named Carl. Additionally, Herb's story about the old couple was cut nearly in half, with Lish removing the story of the old couple's home life, love, and reunion in the hospital. In Carver's original version, the two had separate rooms, which caused them to pine for each other and eventually led to a scene when they met again. Lish removed all of this, rewrote the couple into the same room, but in body casts that prevented them from seeing each other, and then explained the old man's distress thus: > \\"I mean, the accident was one thing, but it wasn't everything. I'd get up to > his mouth-hole, you know, and he'd say no, it wasn't the accident exactly > but it was because he couldn't see her through the eye-holes. He said that > that was making him feel so bad. Can you imagine? I'm telling you, the man's > heart was breaking because he couldn't turn his goddamn head and 'see' his > goddamn wife.\\" Mel looked around the table and shook his head at what he was > going to say. \\"I mean, it was killing the old fart just because he couldn't > 'look' at the fucking woman.\\" Lish also cut out eight paragraphs at the end, in which Terri communicates her worry over Herb's depression to Laura and Nick, and another aspect of love is shown as Laura comforts Terri, tying together all the types of love discussed in the story. Editing There was some contention between Raymond Carver and his editor Gordon Lish over several stories in the collection; the author complained about the \\"surgical amputation and transplant that might make them someway fit into the carton so the lid will close.\\"Raymond Carver's story \\"Beginners\\" and Gordon Lish's edits of the story create the first published version, entitled \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\\" Eventually, the book was published with Lish's extensive alterations, and received critical acclaim. Shortly before his death, Carver arranged the publication of his own selection of 37 of his stories, Where I'm Calling From: Selected Tales. He included some stories as edited by Lish, some restored from his original manuscripts, and some unpublished stories. Carver's widow, Tess Gallagher, fought with Knopf for permission to republish the 17 stories in What We Talk About When We Talk About Love as they were originally written by Carver. These original versions eventually appeared in Beginners, published by Jonathan Cape in 2009, and in the Library of America volume Collected Stories. Links to other works * The stories \\"So Much Water So Close to Home\\" and \\"Tell the Women We're Going\\" were adapted for Robert Altman's 1993 feature film Short Cuts. The former was the inspiration for the Paul Kelly song of the same name and was also later adapted for the 2006 film Jindabyne. * The story \\"Why Don't You Dance?\\" serves as the basis for the award-winning 2004 short film Everything Goes as well as for the 2010 feature film Everything Must Go. * The 2012 film Stuck in Love uses the quote ‚ÄúI could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart. I could hear the human noise we sat there making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark‚Äù from \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\\" as the main character's, author Bill Borgens's, favorite quote. They were the last words spoken in the film. * Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's 2014 film Birdman or: The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance depicts an eclipsed Hollywood star, Riggan Thomson, who mounts a Broadway production of \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\\" as its central storyline. The Broadway production includes several aspects of the Carver story ‚Äî such as the four friends telling stories over a bottle of gin, and Mel's story about the couple in the car crash ‚Äî but also includes other, more melodramatic storylines that are not part of the Carver story. Thomson attributes his choice of acting as a profession to a complimentary note he once received from Carver written on a cocktail napkin.

Campbell recorded with the Columbia, Davega, Perfect and Path√© labels. Although a tenor, Campbell had a very rich voice and could also sing baritone, and described himself as a tenore robusto.  Childhood  Campbell was born in London, Ontario to Alexander and Elizabeth Campbell in 1878. While Campbell was young, the family moved several times, living in Hamilton and Owen Sound before settling down in Winnipeg. His first performance on stage took place in Winnipeg, when he performed for the High School Literary Society.  Career  Campbell made a formal debut in 1909 in the role of Alfred Blake in The Love Cure by Edmund Eysler at the New Amsterdam Theatre. He began touring the United States and Canada as a vaudeville tenor on the Keith-Orpheum and Loew tour circuits. In 1912, Campbell starred as Jack Travers in the first production of Rudolf Friml's operetta The Firefly, which was performed at the Lyric Theatre. The female lead was Emma Trentini. This would lead to Campbell's first recording, when he recorded the song A Woman's Smile from this play for the Columbia Record Company. Campbell became a member of the American Society of Singers in 1914. Campbell began giving performances in American opera halls and on concert stages. He appeared as a lead with Julia Claussen in Faust and Helena at the New York Symphony Orchestra in 1918. The next year, he sang Die Fledermaus with the St. Louis Municipal Opera. In 1931, he sang the role of Dick Dauntless in Ruddigore which was performed in Erlanger's Theater. Campbell retired from the stage sometime in the late 1930s, but continued to perform as an amateur in St. John's Episcopal Church's choir in Jersey City, New Jersey until 1954. He died in New York in 1965.  Recordings  * A dream by James Bartlett and Charles Cory, recorded June 1912, released 1912 as Side A on Columbia Phonograph Company #A 1249.

It was operated by a Pan Am Boeing 707-321B bearing the registration N417PA and named Clipper Winged Racer. On July 22, 1973, at 10:06 P.M. local time, the Boeing 707 took off from Fa'a'ƒÅ International Airport in Papeete. Thirty seconds after takeoff, the airliner, carrying 79 passengers and crew, crashed into the sea. Crew The pilot was Robert M. Evarts of Grass Valley, California, 60, who had 25,275 flight hours. Evarts's copilot was Lyle C. Havens, 60, from Medford, Oregon, who had 21,575 flight hours. The flight engineer was Isaac N. Lambert, 38, of Danville, California (9,134 flight hours). The navigator was Frederick W. Fischer, 33, of Rochester, New York. He had 3,961 flight hours. Accident description When the aircraft had reached an altitude of , it began to descend, banking left. The increasingly excessive bank caused the 707 to crash into the sea and sink off Papeete. Because the turn was made towards the sea at night, no visual references were available. The sole survivor of the accident was a Canadian citizen. At the time, he said he had no memory of the actual crash, but \\"woke up\\" in the water. Many private vessels sortied from Papeete harbor that night, with more joining at first light to aid in the search for survivors. The bodies of several of the flight attendants were the only ones recovered. Although no official cause was determined, it is believed that an instrument failure during the climb out turn may have contributed to the accident. Speculation at the time also focused on a catastrophic windshield failure, as well as a gyro horizon malfunction. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder are believed to have sunk in of water, and were never recovered.

Assigned to operate with the South Atlantic Blockade  Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Flambeau arrived at Nassau, New Providence, 11 December 1861, and for a month patrolled this key base for blockade runners. On 22 January 1862, Flambeau arrived at Port Royal, South Carolina, from which she was ordered to blockade Stono Inlet, one of the entrances to Charleston Harbor.  Flambeau‚Äôs foraging party captured by Confederates  For the next year, she cruised off Charleston, sharing in the capture of several prizes, and sending a party ashore 28 December to destroy the abandoned fort on Bull's Island. Returning to Bull's Bay on 31 January 1863, she sent a foraging party ashore, all of whom were captured. The following day, the Flambeau landed a rescue party, but it was intercepted and had one man killed and one wounded in the ensuing skirmish.  Florida and Georgia operations  In February 1863, Flambeau delivered stores to ships on the coasts of Florida and Georgia, then returned to duty off Charleston until April. After repairs at Washington, D.C., she joined her squadron at New Inlet from May through September, taking schooner Betty Kratzer prize on 23 June.

It was announced on November 6, 2007 for the 2008 model year, replacing the 749, although the 848 model name was already listed on the compatible parts table for the 1098 fuel tank, giving away the secret a few months early. The 848 makes a tested at 10,000 rpm and at 8,250 rpm. With a manufacturer claimed dry weight of , the 848 undercuts its larger displacement sibling, the 1198, by . In August 2010, Ducati announced the 848 Evo, as the evolution of the model. The bike featured small revisions such as a black swingarm, Mono-block Brembo brake calipers, steering damper mount as well as some very minor engine revisions. In 2013, Ducati announced the 848 was replaced by the 899 Panigale. Changes from predecessor =Trellis frame= Developed in cooperation with Ducati Corse, the 848 trellis frame uses a simplified tube layout from the Ducati 749 featuring main section tubes that are enlarged in diameter from 28 mm to 34 mm, while being reduced in thickness from 2 mm to 1.5 mm. The result is a 14% increase in rigidity and a weight savings of , helping the 848 weigh less than the 749. =Engine revision= Race-Prepped Ducati 848 at Miller Motorsports Park While most of the chassis components are identical to the 1098/1198, the motor was an all new design in 2008. Producing roughly at the rear wheel, it outperforms the Ducati 916 that had a hard time producing more than and even the upgraded Ducati 998 that produced at the rear wheel. The \\"Testastretta Evoluzione\\" uses a 94 x 61.2 mm bore and stroke for 849 cc of displacement despite the bike's moniker of 848. The motor casings were constructed using a new vacuum die-casting method called Vacural that helps the engine weigh less than the Ducati 749. The intake valves were increased 2.5 mm from the Ducati 749 numbers to 39.5 mm. The exhaust valves were enlarged 1.5 mm to 32 mm. The valve angles are identical to the Ducati 1098. The bike uses a pair of elliptical 56 mm throttle bodies fashioned after MotoGP designs. The 2011 Ducati 848 Evo featured minor changes to the engine, including new Marelli throttle bodies, revised cylinder heads with straighter intake ports and reshaped combustion chambers. Ducati claimed these changes would result in a increase, bringing output to measured at the crank; however, Cycle World magazine's first dyno test of the engine showed a mere increase over the previous motor. Ducati 848 EVO =Wet clutch= Although the 1198 and 848 share many similar components, as per the 916/748 and 999/749 models, the 848 uses a wet clutch rather than the traditional dry clutch of previous superbikes from Ducati. The manufacturer claims it reduces weight, improves both service life and \\"feel\\" of the clutch and reduces noise. Ducati has in the past held to only dry clutches in accordance with marketing their bikes as obeying the design imperatives of racing above all, unlike, as Ducati would have it, ordinary street bikes. While a dry clutch \\"rattles like a bucket of rocks,\\" Ducati and its adherents felt the clutch's \\"typical noise is music to bikers' ears.\\" The 848's wet clutch is a stark departure from this, because, \\"Ducati made it very clear that there is a new philosophy within the factory to develop each bike with specifications and capabilities that are aligned with the bike's target audience and intended environment.\\" Ducati 848 Comparison with larger Ducati superbikes The 848 shares more physical and technical design elements with the stronger 1098/1198 than its predecessor, the 749, did with the 999. In many cases the 1098/1198 and the 848 are identical right down to the part numbers. The two bikes use the same bodywork, including the fuel tank. With the exception of the steering damper mount, the frame between the bikes is the same, which results in identical wheelbase and rake and trail numbers. The second generation 848 Evo features the same monoblock brakes and the same frame with the steering damper mount as the 1098/1198. The rear suspension, including the suspension linkage is the same, using identical Showa shocks. Many components of the exhaust system are shared, including the exhaust canisters that house the muffler and catalytic converter. Despite the difference in engine displacement, the two bikes share valve angles and magnesium valve covers. The oil cooler and radiator are also very similar. The transmissions are different with the ratios on the 848 being closer together.

Opened in 1892, it was the first mine on the Mesabi Range, which has proved to be the largest iron ore deposit ever discovered. Mining operations at the site ceased in 1956. The bottom of the open-pit mine has filled with water but its dimensions are readily visible. With The city maintains an overlook in Mountain Iron Locomotive Park. Mountain Iron Mine was proclaimed a National Historic Landmark in 1968 and subsequently listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its national significance in the theme of industry. The property was nominated for setting in motion the extraction of iron ore on the Mesabi Range, which helped make Minnesota the nation's largest iron producer and the United States the world's largest steel manufacturer. History The discovery of a boulder of high-grade iron ore by Leonidas Merritt in 1887 during a railroad survey prompted he and his brothers to establish the Mountain Iron Mine in 1892. By 1893 the \\"Seven Iron Brothers\\" had claims on a significant portion of the Mesabi Range and had built the Duluth, Missabe and Northern Railway (DM&IR;). Financial conditions forced them sell their shares to John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller later sold his interests to Andrew Carnegie. The early development was as an underground mine, but open-pit mining soon proved to be a better choice because of the soft, shallow ore deposits. The Mesabi Range and nearby Vermilion Range led Minnesota to become the nation's largest producer of iron ore and the United States to lead the world in steel production. This capacity is considered to have been a major factor in America's ability to contribute to World War II. It also played a major role in the financial success of Andrew Carnegie and U.S. Steel. Carnegie returned some of his fortune to the communities by funding 2,500 public Carnegie libraries across the country, including 64 in Minnesota. The extraction of ore in the region also contributed to the city of Duluth thriving and becoming the leading port in the United States (by tonnage) in the early 20th century.

Built in 1805, it is a good example of Federal period architecture, and has had a series of distinguished residents. Most notable are James Monroe, who occupied it as United States Secretary of War and as President of the United States while the White House was restored after the War of 1812, and historian Henry Adams. However, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975 for its association with meteorologist Cleveland Abbe (1838‚Äì1916), the founder of the National Weather Service, who lived here from 1877 until his death. It is now home to the Arts Club of Washington. Description and history The Cleveland Abbe House stands northwest of the White House, on the north side of \\"I\\" Street across from James Monroe Park and near its junction with Pennsylvania Avenue. It is a three-story brick row house, built out of red brick and topped by a dormered gable roof. It is four bays wide, with the entrance in the leftmost bay. Windows are rectangular sash, with stone sills and splayed keystone lintels. A stone stringcourse separates each of the floors from the next. The main entrance has an elaborate Federal surround, with sidelight windows and a large half-round transom window. The interior of the house retains original Federal period finishes. History Timothy Caldwell built the house around 1802 to 1805. James Monroe lived there from 1811 to 1817, a period during which he was Secretary of State and War Secretary. From his inauguration as America's fifth President in March 1817 until the White House was fully restored in September 1817, the Cleveland Abbe House served as the Presidential residence. In the 1820s, the house was occupied by the British legation. Henry Adams lived here with his parents, Charles Francis Adams Sr., and Abigail Brooks, in 1860 to 1861. Cleveland Abbe, founder of the U.S. Weather Bureau, lived here from 1877 to 1909. It was during his ownership that a number of alterations were made to the house. He raised it from 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 stories, demolished some of its outbuildings, and built additional rooms onto the rear. After Abbe's death in 1916, the Arts Club of Washington purchased the building.Abbe House (Arts Club of Washington) The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Arts Club of Washington\\" in 1969.

Roosevelt platform for the Paris M√©tro on 15 November. The 2007 strikes in France were a series of general strikes, mostly in the public sector, which started on 13 November 2007. The strike was over President Nicolas Sarkozy's and Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon's attempt to reduce early retirement benefits for 500,000 public employees. Sarkozy had stated that pension reform is the first in a series of measures designed to roll back protections for trade unions in France, and both unions and Sarkozy saw the pension strikes as a key political test. Cause of the strikes France's national labour law permits workers in certain hazardous or difficult professions to retire with full pension benefits after 37.5 years rather than 40 years. The Sarkozy administration claims the current pension system allows some public sector workers to retire as early as age 50. The government calculated the cost of these early-retirement benefits at $7 billion a year. President Nicolas Sarkozy felt that his victory in the 2007 presidential election gave him a mandate to carry out labour reforms, stating \\"I said before I was elected what I would do,\\" and \\"we will do these reforms because they have to be done.\\" He declared the strikes a test of political will. \\"I will pursue these reforms to the end,\\" he said in a speech to the European Parliament. \\"Nothing will blow me off course.\\" Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon attacked the unions for depriving millions of French people \\"of their fundamental freedom‚Äîthe freedom of movement and even perhaps to work.\\" Bernard Thibault, the secretary of the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail (CGT), France's second-largest labour union, compared the strikes to the 1995 strikes in France, saying, \\"The general discontent is as strong as then,\\" and \\"We're not trying to copy 1995, but the strike could last.\\" Beginning of the strikes Passengers waiting for the next train at the La D√©fense M√©tro station. Access to the station had to be restricted due to overcrowding On 13 November 2007, SNCF rail workers and Paris M√©tro personnel became the first group of workers to commence their strike. Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand met with union leaders on 14 November 2007 to try to find a resolution. On the first day of the strike, only 90 out of 700 TGV trains were running, and other rail services were reduced sharply. In Paris, the M√©tro was only running at 20% capacity and bus services only at 15%. However, some M√©tro lines experienced fewer disruptions than expected, leading some observers to conclude that support for the strike was not as strong as unions claimed. 30% of the workers of the 70% state owned Gaz de France and √âlectricit√© de France went on strike on 13 November, reducing the national electricity production by 8000 MW (roughly 10%). There were no fears of power outages. The Op√©ra National de Paris, a group subject to the special retirement plan (r√©gimes sp√©ciaux de retraite), also cancelled performances. However in a short interview granted to the BBC the director claimed these cancellations were due to insufficient customers because of travel difficulties incurred by the strikes. In addition, some university students demonstrated and blocked the entrances to their campuses in opposition to plans to allow private funding of Universities. In the University of Nanterre students were forcefully removed by riot police, however this was censored on the national news. On 13 November the newspaper Le Figaro (which is owned by Sarkozy supporter Serge Dassault ) and the cable news channel LCI reported that a survey found that about 7 out of 10 people said the strikes were unjustified. Conclusion of the strikes Minister of Employment, Social Cohesion and Housing Xavier Bertrand, whose portfolio includes labor relations, held several negotiating sessions with the unions throughout the day on 13 and 14 November. Bertrand told the unions that pension reform was non-negotiable, but proposed a month-long period of negotiations between the unions and each state-controlled agency to discuss ways to minimize the effects on existing workers. Some improvements in mass transit also occurred on 14 November. The main M√©tro commuter lines remained shut, while other lines ran between 20 and 50 percent of normal capacity. However, only a third of Paris buses were running. The Associated Press reported that 150 of the 700 high-speed TGV trains were running, an increase of 60 over the day before. On 18 November, a demonstration was held by pro- reform and anti-strike organizations in Paris. They gathered between 8,000 and 20,000 protesters against public transportation strikers, calling them \\"hostage takers\\".Plusieurs milliers de personnes manifestent √† Paris contre les gr√®ves dans les transports, La Tribune, 18/11/07 Percentage of RATP and SNCF employees reported as being on strike by their employers 20 November marked the 7th day of striking and strikers were joined by other civil servants including teachers, postal workers and newspaper printers. The printers were also protesting against reorganisations within the printing industry. Air traffic control employees were also on strike, causing delays of 45 minutes on flights from the Parisian airports according to ADP. During the night from 20 November to 21 November, the TGV network was sabotaged by fires, further adding to the delays. Approximately 30 kilometres of track were damaged, both the unions and the President condemned these acts. On 21 November, the CGT called for the strikes to stop as the government has allegedly agreed to negotiate. An opinion poll published in the Figaro estimates 2/3 of the French are against the strike, and the Ministry of Economy declared that the strike was costing the French economy ‚Ç¨400 million a day and SNCF ‚Ç¨100 million a day. According to the SNCF, the operator of the national train lines 23% of their staff were still on strike, while the RATP operating the Paris M√©tro, and some suburban trains claimed 16% of their staff were on strike. However the service on the Parisian trains and M√©tro was still below 25% because most of the strikers were train drivers. On 21 November the number of strikers continued to diminish, and talks were engaged in-between the government and the unions. Strikes continued on 22 November with the numbers of strikers still diminishing, and public transport was still heavily affected. Following a day of ongoing talks with the government, 42 of the 45 union committees voted to stop the strike, and the RATP and SNCF announced almost normal levels of service for 23 November, with in-between 70 and 100% of public transport services running. It is said talks could last for a month. =Planned strikes= Several additional strikes were also planned. Among them are: * 29 November 2007 - Employees of the justice system.

The primary purpose of such analysis is to determine the color of the finish used at a particular time in the building's history, usually the original construction, but not always. Secondary purposes include determination of ingredients such as media (water, oil, latex, etc.) and pigments (organic pigments, inorganic pigments, dyes, etc.). Paint analysis is also used at times as a dating technique for various building elements. Typical problems encountered in historic paint analysis include such things as paint loss, surface deterioration, newer materials, substrates, delamination, media and pigment deterioration, and alligatoring. History Historic architectural paint analysis finds its roots in the early twentieth century in the United States. The historic preservation movement began in 1849 with the preservation of Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington. Early preservationists began to realize that paints and finishes which had survived were very important but may not have been the original, or historic, finishes. Interest in historic wallpapers also developed with the interest in historic paint and color. One of the earliest endeavors came with the restoration of Williamsburg, Virginia funded by John D. Rockefeller in the 1920s. Early investigations by simple scraping of the finishes by Susan NashTaylor, Jr.,Thomas H., and Papas, Jr., Nicholas A. \\"Colonial Williamsburg Colors: A Changing Spectrum\\". In Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings, Roger W. Moss, ed. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994 of the surviving original buildings yielded a palette that became popularly known as Williamsburg colors. In the 1950s and 1960s, serious efforts at investigating original paint colors were underway at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia by architect Penelope Hartshorne Batcheler. Her pioneering efforts introduced, for the first time in this country, the use of a stereo microscope to more closely examine the 18th century paints at Independence Hall. Batcheler also introduced the use of the Munsell Color System for matching and referencing original paint colors. Her landmark publication, \\"Paint Color Research and Restoration\\", was the very first publication concerning the analysis of historic architectural paints for determination of original colors. At the same time, in the United Kingdom, microscopy of paint samples was developed by Joyce Plesters of the National Gallery, London who worked mainly with easel paintings but also with samples from wall- paintings.Joyce Plesters, 'Cross-sections & Chemical Analysis of Paint Samples', Studies in Conservation, vol. 2, (1956), 110-157. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Morgan W. Phillips at the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA) became involved with historic paint and color analysis, specifically at the Harrison Gray Otis House in Boston. At the same time, E. Blaine Cliver, Historical Architect, who originally worked with Batcheler at the National Park Service (NPS) in Philadelphia, then with the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, DC and later at the Northeast Regional Office of the NPS, became involved with historic paint analysis, especially in a laboratory in Building 28 of the former Boston Navy Yard. In the early 1970s, Frank S. Welsh joined the NPS in Philadelphia and began his research and study of historic paints with Penelope Batcheler, where he introduced the use of the National Bureau of Standards Color Name Charts, (NIST) for naming the colors matched to the Munsell Color System. Welsh also was the first to introduce the term \\"paint analysis\\" into the lexicon of historic preservation.Welsh, Frank S. \\"Paint & Color Restoration,\\" The Old- House Journal, Vol. 3, No. 8, August, 1975. 1,8-9. As an independent historic paint color consultant one of his first major projects was Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. In the mid 1970s, Matthew J. Mosca started working for the National Trust with Blaine Cliver. Later, as a preservation consultant, Mosca researched the historic colors of Mount Vernon. The advances in the science of paint color research by these individuals suggested that the popular Williamsburg colors had been matched to faded and aged finishes. During the 1980s and 1990s, Colonial Williamsburg consulted with Welsh to undertake a comprehensive paint and color analysis on numerous buildings in the historic area. Taylor, Jr., Thomas H. and Pappas, Nicholas A., \\"Colonial Williamsburg: A Changing Spectrum,\\" in Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings, Roger W. Moss, ed. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, 86. In his research, \\"the first modern scientific paint analysis\\" there, confirmed that the Williamsburg color palette did not represent the actual historic colors. In addition he found that in many cases their early efforts had mistakenly matched later paint layers, some nineteenth-century.Taylor, Jr.,Thomas H., and Papas, Jr., Nicholas A. 'Colonial Williamsburg Colors: A Changing Spectrum,' in, Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings, Roger W. Moss, ed. (New York, John Wiley, 1994) Historically, paint analysis was done on site by carefully removing later paint layers to reveal a sequence of finishes down to the substrate. This was the methodology employed during the early restoration of finishes at Historic Williamsburg. Although this method is employed by a few practitioners, it is not common because of its inherent problems of misinterpretation and failure to address issues such as paint ageing and discoloration.see the following paper: Patrick Baty ‚ÄúTo Scrape or Not to Scrape‚Äù for the drawbacks of carrying out a scrape. This was originally published in Traditional Paint News vol.1, no.2. 1996. Because finishes analysis is performed under laboratory conditions samples are collected in the field for later analysis and can be collected by the analyst or by his client who then ships them to him. Laboratory analysis The primary purposes of analysis are to determine historic finishes and to determine principle components such as media or basic pigments. There are two methodologies in the preparation of paint samples for microscopic analysis. The first, which is derived from the medical world, is to treat the sample as a specimen and set it into a fixed position in a permanent medium such as paraffin. The specimen is then ground to a flat finish, providing a horizontal surface for viewing under a microscope. The second is to leave the samples in a loose condition with their broken surfaces which then can be manipulated under the microscope to permit a variety of views of the layers. The primary disadvantage to the first method is that the grinding process tends to blur layers together, especially layers of similar or identical colors. It also provide only a single, fixed point of viewing. The second method lacks these disadvantages, although skill and experience is required to manipulate the samples effectively. Following preparation of the samples, they are typically viewed under an optical microscope using either natural north light or polarized artificial light simulating natural north light. North light is essential in order to render the colors accurately without the effects of the yellow spectrum of direct sunlight. Each individual layer is identified and, typically, matched to the Munsell color system. The Munsell color system is a scientific system in which colors have been ranged into a color fan based upon three attributes: hue or color, the chroma or color saturation, and the value or neutral lightness or darkness. Unlike color systems developed by paint manufacturers, the Munsell system provides an unchanging standard of reference which is unaffected by the marketplace and changing tastes in colors. The hue notation, the color, indicates the relation of the sample to a visually equally spaced scale of 100 hues. There are 10 major hues, five principal and five intermediate within this scale. The hues are identified by initials indicating the central member of the group: red R, yellow-red YR, yellow Y, yellow-green YG, green G, blue-green BG, blue B, purple-blue PB, purple P, and red-purple PR. The hues in each group are identified by the numbers 1 to 10. The most purplish of the red hues, 1 on the scale of 100, is designated as 1R, the most yellowish as 10R, and the central hue as 5R. The hue 10R can also be expressed as 10, 5Y as 25, and so forth if a notation of the hue as a number is desired. Chroma indicates the degree of departure of a given hue from the neutral gray axis of the same value. It is the strength of saturation of color from neutral gray, written /0 to /14 or further for maximum color saturation. Value, or lightness, makes up the neutral gray axis of the color wheel, ranging from black, number 1, to white at the top of the axis, number 10. A visual value can be approximated by the help of the neutral gray chips of the Rock or Soil Color chart with ten intervals. The color parameters can be expressed with figures semi-quantitatively as: hue, value/chroma (H, V/C). The color \\"medium red\\" should serve as an example for presentation with the three color attributes, 5R 5.5/6. This means that 5R is located in the middle of the red hue, 5.5 is the lightness of Munsell value near the middle between light and dark, and 6 is the degree of the Munsell chroma, or the color saturation, which is about in the middle of the saturation scale.

The NBS had its roots in the 1938 foundation of the Bund Treuer Eidgenossen Nationalsozialistischer Weltanschauung by Rolf Henne after the more moderate Robert Tobler had removed Henne from the leadership of the National Front.Alan Morris Schom, A Survey of Nazi and Pro- Nazi Groups in Switzerland: 1930‚Äì1945 , Simon Wiesenthal Center In 1940, the Bund absorbed a number of tiny Nazi-supporting organisations to become the NBS under Henne and Dr. Max Leo Keller. Other groups absorbed included the Eidgen√∂ssische Soziale Arbeiterpartei and elements of the National Front. The new group also officially bore the French-language name Mouvement Nationale Suisse as an appeal to Francophone Swiss.Georges Andr√© Chevallaz, The Challenge of Neutrality: Diplomacy and the Defense of Switzerland, Lexington Books, 2001, p. 95 Keller had worked with Heinrich Himmler and brought with him Andreas von Sprecher, whom the SS had trained, to run the new group's propaganda department. Keller, Jakob Schaffner and Ernst Hofmann, as representatives of the NBS, received an audience with the Swiss President Marcel Pilet-Golaz (in office throughout 1940) in which they demanded much closer relations with Nazi Germany, leading to eventual incorporation. This was followed by a Munich conference in October 1940 to which the Director of the Reich Main Security Office, Reinhard Heydrich and the Swiss doctor and SS- member Franz Riedweg invited the leaders of the NBS and of other Swiss groups in order to increase cohesion. Ultimately the meeting strengthened the hand of the NBS, as the remnants of the Bund Treuer Eidgenossen Nationalsozialistischer Weltanschauung as well as the Eidgen√∂ssische Soziale Arbeiter-Partei and Ernst Leonhardt's Nationalsozialistische Schweizerische Arbeitspartei agreed to be absorbed into the movement. Despite this strengthening the National Movement did not last long, as the Swiss Federal Council feared that annexation by Germany was just around the corner. In a series of moves against the most extreme groups, the NBS was closed down on 19 November 1940, by which time it had 160 cells and around 4000 members. The group continued to work underground for a time before a police crackdown which led to most of the leadership fleeing to Germany. Whilst in Germany Keller set up the Bund der Schweizer Nationalsozialisten as an √©migr√© movement, although its influence remained limited; eventually he returned to Switzerland in 1941. Meanwhile, various NBS units continued underground activity secretly, mostly with help from the SS, until World War II ended in 1945.

He was preceded by his father Me√±li I Giray (r. 1478‚Äì1515) and followed by his son ƒûazƒ± I Giray (1523‚Äì1524). He gained control of the steppe nomads, put his brother on the throne of Kazan and was killed after taking Astrakhan. Had he not been killed he might have joined the three khanates with the Nogais and re-created something like the Golden Horde. As Kalga As his father‚Äôs Kalga or designated successor and co-ruler, he participated in a number of raids northward. In 1505 he and his father raided what is now Belarus. In 1507 they advanced toward Russia, but turned back on learning of a Nogai raid on Crimea. Mehmed fell from his horse and became ill. The force returned to Crimea. In 1509 the Nogais planned to attack Crimea. Mehmed and a very large army defeated them as they were crossing the Volga. Much booty was taken. In 1510 he was also successful against the Nogais. In 1512 he raided Russia but was driven back by troops from Ryazan. In 1514 he was driven back from the Severia. In 1515, in alliance with the Lithuaneans he besieged Novgorod- Seversky. Starodub and Chernogov and took many captives. (A common tactic was to bottle up troops in the towns and loot the surrounding countryside.) For these raids see Crimean-Nogai Raids#List of raids for 1505‚Äì1523. As Khan When his father died in April 1515 Mehmed was at Perekop. The old Khan‚Äôs death was concealed for forty days until Mehmed reached the capital. (the reason for this is not given.) Akhmed's rebellion: He appointed as Kalga his younger brother Akhmed the Lame. Akhmed was given Ochakov and raided Lithuania but soon revolted. He intrigued with Moscow and sent his eldest son Gemmet to Istanbul to request military aid against Mehmed. In the spring of 1519 Mehmed sent his sons Alp and Bakhadyr against Akhmed, who was killed in the steppe beyond Perekop. Bakhadyr became Kalga. Alp became Kalga in 1523 when Bakhadyr became khan of Astrakhan. (Howorth (1880), following Nikolay Karamzin (1818) speaks of intrigues and bribes involving Akhmed, Mehmed, Vasili III of Russia and Sigismund the Old of Poland). Nogais: A major problem of his reign was gaining control of the Nogai nomads to the north who had become fragmented after the fall of the Golden Horde in 1502. In 1519 a Kazakh invasion drove many Nogais west of the Volga. They asked asylum in the Khan‚Äôs territory. Two years later the Kazakh khan died and the Nogais pushed back east, but their oath was not forgotten and the Crimean khan could claim sovereignty as far east as the Emba. Crimea continued to raid Lithuania and Russia. Kazan and Moscow: In 1519 the Russians placed their prot√©g√© Shah Ali on the throne of Kazan. The local mirzas asked Mehmed to send one of his family to replace Shah Ali. In the spring of 1521 Mehmed‚Äôs brother Sahib I Giray arrived at Kazan and easily expelled Shah Ali with local help. The two brother Khans then launched an attack on Muscovy. Sahib Giray went west and captured and burned Nizhny Novgorod and Vladimir. At the same time 100,000 Crimeans, Nogais and Lithuanians moved north and crossed the Oka River in July. The two forces joined near Kolomna and moved on Moscow. Vasili III of Russia fled his capital for Volokolamsk to gather troops. They looted the area around Moscow from 1 to 12 August. On the approach of Vasili‚Äôs army they drew back and looted the regions of Kolomna, Bobrovsk, Kashira and Ryazan. An attempt to besiege Ryazan failed. Mehmed returned to the steppe with a huge number of captives. Astrakhan: At the end of 1522 Mehmed decided to capture Astrakhan. The Nogai Mirzas Agish and Mamai joined him. In the spring of 1523 he arrived with a large army. The town was taken without fighting and Khan Hussein fled. Mehmed appointed his eldest son Kalga Bakhadyr as Khan of Astrakhan and unwisely disbanded most of his army. Agish and Mamai grew fearful of Mehmet‚Äôs increasing power. They lured him out of town and killed Mehmet and Bakhadyr along with their guards. The remaining Crimean troops were defeated or scattered across the steppe. Mehmet‚Äôs sons Gazi and Baba reached Crimea along with fifty Mirzas. They were followed by a Nogai army which ravaged much of Crimea but could not take the towns. Mehmed's son ƒûazƒ± I Giray (1523‚Äì24) became khan.

These include the bushbuck, kudus, and the elands. The scientific name is in reference to the mythical creature the tragelaph, a Chimera with the body of a stag and the head of a goat. They are medium-to-large, tall, long-legged antelopes characterized by their iconic twisted horns and striking pelage coloration patterns (most common is the distinctive white, vertical barring). Despite being among the largest species of antelope, they are actually more closely related to cattle (Bos taurus), and together along with a few apparent Asiatic species belong to the subfamily Bovinae. While the group's evolutionary history occurred in Africa, there have been fossil species that have been found in Eurasia (which may also be the place of origin for this group). The number of genera and species is debated as some consider there to be one or two genera with nine species, while others consider there to be five genera and 25 species. In general, spiral-horned antelopes can be roughly divided into two groups: robust forms (which only consists of the two eland species, Taurotragus) and gracile forms (the rest of them, in the genus Tragelaphus, although this taxon is an unnatural grouping, and might warrant additional genera). Spiral-horned antelopes are browsers that are found in a wide variety of habitats, from arid environments to humid environments, spanning from semi-deserts, savannas, rainforests and mountains. Despite these variant environments, all species prefer living in dense bush or thicket, helping them to be concealed from their natural predators. Considered to be among the most beautiful and charismatic among bovids, the various species of spiral-horned antelopes are found in zoos and private or public game reserves. The two eland species have had small success as exotic farm animals seen as great alternatives to cattle, both in terms of how hardy they are in extreme environments, their placid nature and nutritional benefits. Etymology This is a woodcut is of the tragelaph from the book, The History of Four-footed Beasts and Serpents by Edward Topsell. The tribe name \\"Tragelaphini\\" was published as a subfamily (\\"Tragelaphinae\\") by British zoologist Edward Blyth in 1863, and was downgraded to tribe by Russian zoologist Vladimir Sokolov in 1953. It refers to the mythical tragelaph which was imagined to be half-goat, half-stag. The root words come from Greek, with () meaning \\"male goat\\" and () meaning \\"stag\\". The suffix \\"‚Äìini\\" refers to their ranking as a tribe. The alternative name \\"Strepsicerotini\\" was published by another British zoologist John Edward Gray as \\"Strepsiceriae\\" earlier in 1846. It comes from Greek with () meaning \\"twisted\\" and () meaning \\"horn\\", referring to the shape of this group's horns. However, \\"Strepsiceriae\\" had the incorrect prefix and suffix, which this was corrected to \\"Strepsicerotini\\" in 1945 by American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson. While the name \\"Strepsicerotini\\" was published first, most scientists used the latter name \\"Tragelaphini\\" as it is more widely used. Systematics =Placement within Bovinae= The spiral-horned antelopes belong to the subfamily Bovinae which also includes oxen of the tribe Bovini and two aberrant species of Asian antelope, the four-horned antelope and the nilgai which belong to the tribe Boselaphini. The relationship between the tribes varies in research concerning their phylogeny. Most molecular research supports a Bovini and Tragelaphini subclade of Bovinae. There are also some morphological support for oxen being the closet living relatives to the spiral-horned antelopes, most notably both groups have horn cores with a pedicle (the attachment point to the skull). There has been a few studies which have supported alternate arrangements, one being a sister relationship between the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and the spiral-horned antelopes. Historically, the nilgai was classified as a tragelaphine by some scientists. Benirschke et al. (1980) worked on karyotypes with the lesser kudu and found them to share with the nilgai an X chromosome fused with autosome 14. Another study that analyzed the COII gene found the nilgai and lesser kudu being sister species (although the support was low and had limited species sampling). The majority of other molecular and morphological work do not support the placement of the nilgai in Tragelaphini, as it contradicts with their data and results. =The fossil record= Tragelaphini has diverged from their closet sister taxon for the last 15 to 18 million years. It was once thought that spiral-horned antelopes were uniquely African, but there have been Eurasian fossils found in Greece and the Caucasus. Kostopoulo and Koufos (2006) have described Pheraios chryssomallos from fossils found in the Turolian locality of Thessaly, Greece. The authors have found cladistic support of P. chryssomallos being the basal most tragelaphin (or at least a sister taxon to the group) based on 46 cranial features. This suggests that the ancestor of all known species of spiral- horned antelope must have originated in Europe during the late Miocene. The eastern European genus Pontoceros is another example, although this animal has been found in early Pleistocene beds of the Mygdonia basin. This suggests that spiral-horned antelopes have emigrated from Africa and into Eurasia during a latter period in their evolutionary history. In addition, undescribed fossils found in South Asia could be related to spiral-horned antelopes. Fossils from Africa have been recovered in places such as Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, but they are sometimes consist of fragmented pieces of leg bone and horn. The oldest known of these species is Tragelaphus moroitu which has been found in the late Miocene to early Pliocene deposits of the Asa Koma, Kuseralee and the Middle Awash deposits in the horn of Africa. Similar in appearance to the nyala (Tragelaphus angasii), T. moroitu was a small antelope and has primitive characteristics in the horn core, making it the most primitive known species of spiral-horn antelope in Africa. The evolution of spiral-horned antelopes based on the abundance of fossils shows they were among the most common species of antelope in Africa, and as climatic changes have occurred throughout their evolution, they have undergone faunal turnovers and adapting to new environments. Below is the list of fossil species that have been described so far listed in alphabetical order: * Tribe Tragelaphini Blyth, 1863 sensu Sokolov, 1953 ** Genus ‚Ä†Pheraios Kostopoulo & Koufos, 2006 *** ‚Ä†Pheraios chryssomallos Kostopoulo & Koufos, 2006 ** Genus ‚Ä†Pontoceros Vereshchagin et al., 1971 *** ‚Ä†Pontoceros surprine Vekua, 2012 *** ‚Ä†Pontoceros ambiguus Vereshchagin et al., 1971 ** Genus Taurotragus Wagner, 1855 *** ‚Ä†Taurotragus arkelli Leakey, 1965 *** ‚Ä†Taurotragus maroccanus Arambourg, 1939 ** Genus Tragelaphus de Blainville, 1816 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus algericus Geraads, 1981 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus gaudryi Thomas 1884 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus kyaloae Harris, 1991 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus lockwoodi Reed & Bibi, 2011 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus moroitu Haile-Selassie et al., 2009 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus nakuae Arambourg, 1941 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus nkondoensis Geraads & Thomas, 1994 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus pricei Wells & Cooke, 1956 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus rastafari Bibi, 2011 *** ‚Ä†Tragelaphus saraitu Geraads et al., 2009 =Taxonomy= Traditionally the tribe was divided into two genera and seven species as shown below: * Tribe Tragelaphini Blyth, 1863 ** Genus Taurotragus Wagner, 1855 ‚Äì elands *** Taurotragus derbianus (Gray, 1847) ‚Äì giant eland *** Taurotragus oryx (Pallas, 1767) ‚Äì common eland ** Genus Tragelaphus de Blainville, 1816 *** Tragelaphus imberbis (Blyth, 1869) ‚Äì lesser kudu *** Tragelaphus angasii Angas, 1849 ‚Äì nyala *** Tragelaphus strepsiceros (Pallas, 1766) ‚Äì greater kudu *** Tragelaphus scriptus (Pallas, 1766) ‚Äì k√©wel *** Tragelaphus sylvaticus Sparrman, 1780 ‚Äì imbabala *** Tragelaphus buxtoni (Lydekker, 1910) ‚Äì mountain nyala *** Tragelaphus euryceros (Ogilby, 1837) ‚Äì bongo *** Tragelaphus spekii Speke, 1863 ‚Äì sitatunga However recent molecular studies have shown a different arrangement. According to the molecular work on the nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA, the lesser kudu and the nyala are the basal most living species. Then around 10 million years ago there has been a split between forest-dwelling, gracile species and larger, open-plains species. This renders Tragelaphus paraphyletic in respect to Taurotragus, which either means to make the latter genus into a junior synonym of the former genus or split Tragelaphus into several genera to maintain Taurotragus. In a 2011 large scale taxonomic study on ungulates by Groves and Grubb, they have found support of cryptic species and should be split into several distinct species. This was based on intensive morphological comparisons between the species (in particular the dimensions of the skull elements and skin colorarion) and defined species based on phylogenetic species concept. Groves and Grubb (2011) furthermore support in the establishment of several new genera in light of Tragelaphus being paraphyletic. Their taxonomy is concurrent with the molecular work, though they have a slight different arrangement among the species in Tragelaphus sensu stricto. Other scientists have mix reactions to this proposal, with some preferring the traditional number of species to be seven and others preferring the new taxonomy from Groves and Grubb (2011). Below is the alternative taxonomy based on Willows-Munro et al. (2005) and Groves and Grubb (2011), with species and subspecies names following Castell√≥ (2016) from Bovids of the World: * Tribe Tragelaphini Blyth, 1863 sensu Sokolov, 1953 ‚Äì spiral-horned antelopes ** Genus Ammelaphus Heller, 1912 ‚Äì lesser kudus *** Ammelaphus imberbis (Blyth, 1869) ‚Äì northern lesser kudu *** Ammelaphus australis Heller, 1913 ‚Äì southern lesser kudu ** Genus Nyala Heller, 1912 *** Nyala angasii (Angas, 1849) ‚Äì lowland nyala ** Genus Taurotragus Wagner, 1855 ‚Äì elands *** Taurotragus derbianus (Gray, 1847) ‚Äì giant eland **** Taurotragus derbianus gigas Heuglin, 1863 ‚Äì eastern giant eland **** Taurotragus derbianus derbianus (Gray, 1847) ‚Äì western giant eland *** Taurotragus oryx (Pallas, 1767) ‚Äì common eland **** Taurotragus oryx ivingstonii Sclater, 1864 ‚Äì Livingstone's eland **** Taurotragus oryx pattersonianus Lydekker, 1906 ‚Äì East African eland **** Taurotragus oryx oryx (Pallas, 1767) ‚Äì Cape eland ** Genus Strepsiceros Hamilton Smith, 1827 ‚Äì greater kudus *** Strepsiceros strepsiceros (Pallas, 1766) ‚Äì Cape greater kudu *** Strepsiceros zambesiensis (Lorenz, 1894) ‚Äì Zambezi greater kudu *** Strepsiceros chora (Cretzschmar, 1826) ‚Äì northern greater kudu *** Strepsiceros cottoni (Dollman & Burlace, 1928) ‚Äì western greater kudu ** Genus Tragelaphus de Blainville, 1816 *** Tragelaphus scriptus group (Pallas, 1766) ‚Äì k√©wel **** Tragelaphus scriptus (Pallas, 1766) ‚Äì western bushbuck **** Tragelaphus phaleratus (Hamilton Smith, 1827) ‚Äì central bushbuck **** Tragelaphus bor Heuglin, 1877 ‚Äì Nile bushbuck **** Tragelaphus decula (R√ºppell, 1835) ‚Äì Abyssinian bushbuck *** Tragelaphus sylvaticus group (Sparrman, 1780) ‚Äì imbabala **** Tragelaphus meneliki Neumann, 1902 ‚Äì Menelik's bushbuck **** Tragelaphus fasciatus Pocock, 1900 ‚Äì eastern coastal bushbuck **** Tragelaphus ornatus Pocock, 1900 ‚Äì Chobe bushbuck **** Tragelaphus sylvaticus (Sparrman, 1780) ‚Äì Cape bushbuck *** Tragelaphus buxtoni (Lydekker, 1910) ‚Äì mountain nyala *** Tragelaphus euryceros (Ogilby, 1837) ‚Äì bongo **** Tragelaphus euryceros isaaci (Thomas, 1902) ‚Äì mountain bongo **** Tragelaphus euryceros euryceros (Ogilby, 1837) ‚Äì lowland bongo *** Tragelaphus spekii group Speke, 1863 ‚Äì sitatungas **** Tragelaphus spekii Speke, 1863 ‚Äì East African sitatunga **** Tragelaphus sylvestris (Meinertzhagen, 1916) ‚Äì Nkosi Island sitatunga **** Tragelaphus larkenii (St. Leger, 1931) ‚Äì Nile sitatunga **** Tragelaphus ugallae Matschie, 1913 ‚Äì Tanzanian sitatunga **** Tragelaphus gratus Sclater, 1880 ‚Äì western sitatunga **** Tragelaphus selousi Rothschild, 1898 ‚Äì Zambezi sitatunga Natural history =General description= Taxiderm mounts of nyala showing the general characteristics seen in this group. The spiral-horned antelopes are medium to large antelopes and generally are tall and long-legged. Horns are present in the males of all species, while females lack them with the exception of bongos and elands. The horns primarily role is used for defensive horn-wrestling which are common during territorial disputes, as well has for horn soiling and sexual display. Other examples of extreme sexual dimorphism can be seen among spiral-horned antelopes. Males are much larger in size than the females, and both sexes have very contrasting pelage coloration. The coloration in females is generally tan to red-brown. Males area a darker hue of the female coloration, which they darken as the animal gets older. Regardless of the coloration of the sexes, most species of spiral-horned antelopes have disruptive coloration that is a distinctive white vertical barring (striped pattern). A spotting pattern can occur as well. Both patterns are individually and geographically variable. These patterns help them to conceal themselves in the dense vegetation from predators. Most species have a white chevron between the eyes, spotted cheeks, the throat having a white patch and the upper-forelegs with dark garters. All except the nyala and the greater kudu have a chest crescent. In addition there are also physical attributes that serve a purpose in social communication such as dorsal crests, white scuts and white tips on the horns. These features help express the animal's emotions as well as alerting members of the herd from predators. Underneath the hair fringe in the hind feet are special glands that encircles the false hooves. =Distribution and ecology= A bongo drinks from a swamp. All species are found in a majority of sub-Saharan Africa in various woodland habitats such as rainforests, swamps, open savannahs, mountains, and sub- deserts. With the exception of the eland and sitatunga, spiral-horned antelopes are all browswers. All species forage on green foliage as well as rely on them for cover. During the dry seasons their diet consists mostly foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs and herbs. They also supplement fruit, flowers, and fresh grass when the rainy season arrives. In response to living in dense cover, spiral-horned antelopes are able to move through the thickett by bounding, rushing, and dodging through the vegetation. Most species are water dependent though kudus and elands do not rely on it as they live in more arid environments. Unlike most species of bovids, spiral-horned antelopes are primarily nocturnal though some species can be seen in the early morning and late afternoon. As with all species of antelope, spiral-horned antelopes (especially the young, the old and the weak) are susceptible to some of Africa's major predators, such as lions, leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. =Behavior and reproduction= A male greater kudu expecting a female in estrus When alert to the presence of danger, the necks of these bovines are raised as high as possible. They move in a \\"goatlike\\" gait, as they move their neck in a pecking motion (moving the head backwards and forwards). As they spot the predator they immediately stop. The ultimate antipredator strategy is concealment in dense, tall bush, enough for the animal to perfectly camouflage in the vegetation. Sometimes they would raise one leg. If that fails they would sprint away in abrupt flight. They are not known to have high stamina for running, although they are known to jump incredibly high. Given the various species of spiral-horned antelope the social organization varies between. The extreme ends of the spectrum are the predominately solitary bushbuck and at the other end the highly social giant eland. In general the herd size of spiral-horned antelopes are not large as they rarely exceed more than a few dozen individuals, and are mostly sedentary in nature. The herd composition is unisexual which is mostly females and their young. It is currently believed to be the reason why some spiral-horned antelopes practicing herd as a defense mechanism to protect the young predators. In the bongo and eland species this led to the development of larger sizes in the females and horns, along with intense social hierarchical ranking (which is not seen in other species which it is only the larger males that dominate over the smaller females). With the exception of the mother and her calf there are no strong social bonds in the herd. These herds are sometimes very open and loosely defined as sometimes females come and go. Males born in the herd will remain in the herd until they developed their primary and secondary sexual characteristics. Once they have developed these traits males leave the herd and become nomads. It is only during the breeding season males congregate around a female in estrus for a few hours. All spiral- horned antelope species are polyandrous. Aggression is very low among individuals of both sexes though intraspecific competition does occur. In females often they neck-fight as well poke and snap at each other. Males would use their horns for wrestling where they try to attack the face. Sometimes there is even intimation from the males to persuade the female into submission as often she would try and retaliate. The gestation period occurs once the female has been inseminated from the male successfully. In most species it lasts approximately seven months, although in the larger species this extends to eight or nine months. They only give birth to a single calf. Once the young are born, they won't wean until they are around five to six months of age. Females sexually mature by two to three years while for males it is four to five years. =Genetics and hybridization= The chromosome number of various species varies. This correlates nicely with the evolutionary relationships among the spiral-horned antelopes. The ancestral Y chromosome was subacrocentric but a pericentric inversion occurred making it submetacentric after the separation of the lesser kudu and nyala. Ancient hybridization also played a key part in the evolution of the chromosomes in all species. Below is a listing of the diploid number 2n as follows (male/female): * Nyala: 2n = 55/56 * Lesser kudu: 2n = 38/38 * Common eland: 2n = 31/32 * Greater kudu: 2n = 31/32 * Imbabala: 2n = 33/34 * Sitatunga: 2n = 30/30 * Bongo: 2n = 33/34 Hybridization between bongos and sitatunga produce fertile offspring known as \\"bongsis\\" and are well documented. These hybrid animals have a diploid number 2n = 33 and all known cases produced female animals, which had developed horns like female bongos while their stripping pattern was intermediate between bongos and sitatungas with an overall orange coloring. The hybridization of these species adds further support in the bongo and sitatunga being each other's closet relatives. Other hybrids have been documented, such as a male common eland x greater kudu resulting from an accidental crossing from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in the 1970s. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears as the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland, with a terminal tuft of hair as in kudu. The individual was, however, azoospermic as analysis showed that it completely lacked germ cells, which produce gametes. Relationships with humans =Conservation= Spiral-horned antelopes as a whole are not an endangered group of mammals. Most species are recognized by the IUCN Red List as \\"least concern\\", with only the giant eland and mountain nyala being classified as vulnerable Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is of vulnerable. and endangered respectively. In addition some local populations and subspecies of the other species have been declining. The main threats to the survival of spiral-horned antelope is habitat destruction and being hunted for bush meat, although most species live in habitat unsuitable for agriculture. In fact in some cases some species might be expanding their numbers (although the accurate population estimates in some species is unknown). =Domestication= Several common elands on a farm. The two eland species are now semi-domesticated as their docile dispositions, large quantities of meat, and resilience in Africa's harsh environments has made them ideal alternatives to cattle in some parts in Africa. In a 2014 comparison between the quality of meat from common elands and cattle, it was found that the meat from male elands was low-fat and more beneficial for human nutritional health but it lacks the sensory texture and flavor that makes cattle meat so appealing to consumers. In addition to being on farm as exotic livestock, elands as well as the other species of spiral-horned antelope have also been brought to private game reserves across the planet (in particular parts in North America and Africa) for recreational hunting. Unlike eland however, most of the other species are not as docile or tolerant of humans as they avoid any contact as possible.

After attending the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, Lewis spent the next two years living and working in Finland, where he learnt to speak Finnish and also came to know and love the Finnish people and culture. Career He founded the Berlitz School of Languages in Finland in 1955, and later opened a further 5 schools in Finland. In addition, he opened Berlitz schools in Norway in 1958 and in Portugal in 1959. In 1966, Lewis founded the Berlitz School in Tokyo and spent the next 5 years living and working in Japan, where he became tutor to Empress Michiko. He claims to speak 11 languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish and Japanese. He is currently Chairman of Richard Lewis Communications Ltd.  The Lewis Model  The Lewis Model of Cross- Cultural Communication was developed by Richard D. Lewis. The core of the model classifies cultural norms into Linear-Active, Multi-Active and Re- Active, or some combination. Broadly speaking, Northern Europe, North America and related countries are predominantly Linear-Active, following tasks sequentially using Platonic, Cartesian logic. Southern European, Latin, African and Middle-Eastern countries are typified as Multi-Active, centred on relationships and often pursuing multiple goals simultaneously. East Asia is typically Re-Active, following harmonising, solidarity-based strategies. While Lewis' writings recognise these can only be stereotypes, he asserts that his model provides a practical framework for understanding and communicating with people of other cultures, and that the model can readily be expanded with other features, such as Hofstede's cultural dimensions, seen in relation to Lewis' triangular representation. Honours Lewis was knighted by President Ahtisaari of Finland in March 1997 in recognition of his services in the cross-cultural field relating to the training of Finnish Ministries for EU entry (1995) and the EU Presidency (1999). He was subsequently promoted to the rank of Knight Commander by President Halonen in 2009. He has always promoted the greatness of the Finnish culture in his publications, which efforts have been highly appreciated by the Finnish government and various public and private organisations.

This award, with its citation \\"Making a World of Difference\\", is granted to an individual who has demonstrated outstanding commitment and service to the intercultural field. Fish Can't See Water by Richard D. Lewis and Kai Hammerich won the Management Book of the Year award in Denmark in 2013. The book has been cited since then in many highly acknowledged business magazines, newspapers and blogs for its practical approach and tips on how national cultures impact corporate strategies and their execution. Lewis publishes regularly articles in the worldwide read business magazine, the Business Insider. His articles focus mainly on tips and background information for doing successful business with different cultures of the world. In 2016 Richard Lewis Communications plc was \\"named and shamed\\" for failing to pay several employees the National Minimum Wage.

As soon as this was clarified, arrears were paid in full to the staff concerned, and the system was changed to comply with National Minimum Wage legislation.

In 1636, De Vries built a blockhouse at Signal Hill on Staten Island, the first signal house erected by European settlers in North America and the future site of Fort Tompkins.Fort Wadsworth at American Forts Network De Vries often acted as a go-between trying to keep the peace between the Lenape and New Netherlands director- general William Kieft. De Vries famously tried to prevent Kieft from launching the Pavonia Massacre, which set off Kieft's War. After the massacre, De Vries was influential in bringing the Hackensack Indians sachem Oratam to negotiate a truce, which did not hold in the face of Kieft's aggressive policies.Ruttenber,E. M.,Indian Tribes of Hudson's River, (Hope Farm Press, 3rd ed, 2001) De Vries became a leading figure in the popular uprising against Kieft in the Dutch colony which ultimately led to the director-general's dismissal and recall for trial. Disenchanted by the New Netherlanders' treatment of the indigenous population, he left his farm at Vriessendael in October 1643, and returned to Holland.

Branch Jr. and members of the Branch family beginning in 1957 though the first What-A- Burger was opened in 1950. With the first location at a busy traffic circle near Newport News, Virginia, in the former Warwick County, they soon established additional locations in the cities of Richmond, Colonial Heights, and Petersburg, Virginia, each along busy through-traffic highway corridors. Another location was opened by a member of the Branch family in the 1950s in Greenville, South Carolina. History What-A-Burger on Jefferson Avenue in Newport News, Virginia in May 2010. It is located just west of the former Newport News Circle, which was the site of the very first What-A-Burger, which was opened by Jack Branch in 1957 and operated by his brother, Paul E. Branch, Jr. May 2010 photo The first Virginia store opened in 1957 by entrepreneur Jack Branch near Newport News, Virginia. Branch's first location predated the first Texas Whataburger restaurant slightly. Newport News Circle was a busy intersection located at Jefferson Avenue and U.S. Route 258 governed by a traffic circle (aka \\"rotary\\") in the former Warwick County. (Warwick County later became politically consolidated with the City of Newport News, assuming the latter's better-known name). U.S. Route 258, later known as Mercury Boulevard in honor of the astronauts of Project Mercury at NASA's center at nearby Langley Air Force Base, led from Fort Monroe to the James River Bridge and has been a major traffic artery in the area for many years. Jefferson Avenue at the time carried Virginia Route 168, which led from Anderson's Corner on U.S. Route 60 west of Colonial Williamsburg to the harbor near Newport News Point, where traffic long crossed Hampton Roads by means of an automobile-carrying ferry (later using the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel). It was a very busy location, especially in the era after World War II and before the U.S. Interstate Highway System was created. Branch's original location on the traffic circle was operated by his brother, Paul E. Branch, Jr., and was moved some years later to another location slightly west of the former traffic circle after a highway modernization project took place. That store is continuing business as of April 2015. Founder Branch later was involved in establishing additional stores in the independent cities of Richmond, Colonial Heights and Petersburg, Virginia, as well as one in South Carolina. The other Virginia stores were located along U.S. Route 1 (Virginia), a major through traffic corridor in the years before Interstate 95 was built. In addition to the U.S. Route 1 locations another Richmond location was added on State Route 161 in Richmond. (Route 161 was touted as a western bypass of Richmond's Lee Bridge in its early pre-Interstate Highway years, using the privately owned Boulevard Bridge to cross the James River. Locations As noted above, the first What-a-Burger is still in operation at 6117 Jefferson Ave. in Newport News, Virginia just west of its original location. Other locations in the Richmond-Petersburg area have closed. The store located at 1018 Boulevard in Colonial Heights, Virginia closed in 2015. A more modern location was opened off Puddledock Rd. just beyond the city limits of Colonial Heights in Prince George, Virginia in 2013 and likely contributed to the closing of the older restaurant. One of the oldest locations, at 909 Jefferson Davis Hwy. in Richmond, VA, which in recent years operated under the names \\"BJ's Big Burger\\" and \\"BJ's What-a-Burger,\\" is also closed; however, the locations at 9901 Jefferson Davis Hwy. in Chesterfield County, Virginia and at 2350 W Washington St. in Petersburg, Virginia remain open. A sister restaurant, loosely affiliated with What-a-Burger and serving a similar, if not identical, menu, operates under the name Roy's Big Burger and is located at 5200 Lakeside Ave. in Richmond, Virginia. A Roy's Big Burger also formerly operated at 4108 Jefferson Davis Hwy. in Richmond, Virginia but is now the location of a Mexican taqueria. Other What-A-Burgers What-A-Burger restaurants (as well with other variations of the name) were formed by other entrepreneurs than the Branch family during the post-World War II period. For example, a small chain now based in Concord, North Carolina, was founded by Eb Bost & C.W. Bost, Jr. and operates as What-A-Burger Drive-Ins, Inc. with several locations, are all still under the leadership of members of their families. It also visibly numbered their stores starting from #1 in Kannapolis, North Carolina to #15 in Concord. The What-A-Burger restaurants in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina are not to be confused with the much larger Whataburger chain based in Texas. Harmon Dobson, a different entrepreneur, established a \\"Whataburger\\" restaurant in Texas on August 8, 1950. He registered the trademark \\"Whataburger\\" in 1957, but the What-A-Burger trademark was registered in 1950. The Texas business eventually became a corporation with as many as 800 \\"Whataburger\\" franchises located throughout the southern United States. The San Antonio, Texas-based chain's sales hit the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2007. However, notwithstanding the much larger size of the Texas-based chain, the locations of the chain were limited to Texas, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The company does not have any locations in the Carolinas or Virginia. Signature food What-A-Burger locations are notable for their large burgers (in comparison with normal fast-food fare). They offer more limited menus than many larger chains. Food is generally cooked to order within sight of waiting customers. Despite being largely bypassed by through traffic using the Interstate Highway System, the Branch family locations in the Richmond- Petersburg and Newport News areas thrived, building a local and loyal following, especially at lunch hours. Reviewers commenting online in both the Richmond and Newport News areas noted many years of their patronage. A recent review in the State (Columbia, SC) newspaper's blog, following their local \\"Cheeseburger crawl\\" stated \\"You can order either the regular What-a-burger or the What-a-burger with cheese; ordering it \\"all the way\\" comes with mustard, onions, pickles, lettuce and tomato, although you can also add ketchup and mayo, or request grilled onions.\\" Lawsuit: a larger chain, similar name During the formative years, neither the Branch family nor Dobson and his associates were apparently aware of the existence of the other. A federal trademark infringement lawsuit between the two Virginia corporations in conflict with the Virginia-based corporations (What-A-Burger of Virginia, Inc. and What-A-Burger of Newport News, Inc.) and the chain based in Texas (Whataburger) was decided in 2004. Based upon the evidence presented when the lawsuit was brought more than 50 years later, the founders, since deceased, apparently first became aware of each other's businesses in 1970. Representatives of the Texas chain told the courts during the federal lawsuit that the company had no plans for expansion into Virginia. (Neither the North Carolina-based What-A-Burger chain nor any of the many others with similar names was a party to this lawsuit). At the conclusion of the 2003‚Äì2004 legal action, the court found that \\"no actionable damages had occurred\\" or were likely to for either party and that there is no reasonable public confusion: \\"There is no evidence ‚Äî nor can we imagine any ‚Äî that consumers are currently likely to be confused about whether the burgers served by Virginia W-A-B come from Texas or Virginia.\\" See also * List of hamburger restaurants References Category:Fast-food chains of the United States Category:Fast- food hamburger restaurants Category:Regional restaurant chains in the United States Category:Restaurants established in 1950 Category:Privately held companies based in Virginia Category:Restaurants in Virginia Category:History of Virginia Category:American companies established in 1950 Category:1950 establishments in Virginia ","title":"What-A-Burger"},{"id":"14104872","text":"Tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium (TDMAT) is a chemical compound.

He served as the founding editor of The Daily Ittefaq. He wrote the editorial Rajnoitik Moncho (The Political Stage). Most of his journalists were considered leftist as Miah followed the pattern of Awami League. According to journalist and editor of Shongbad Bozlur Rahman, Awami activists followed his editorial more than any actual decision of a meeting. Early life Miah was born in Bhandaria Thana of Pirojpur District in 1911. He attended Pirojpur High School upon passing his entrance examination and earned his B. A. degree from Barisal Brojomohun College. He started working under sub-divisional officer of Pirojpur as an assistant. Subsequently, he became Barisal's district public relation officer. He resigned from government job and took up journalism as a profession.  Role as a journalist  Miah wrote his political columns in Bengali. He was equally prolific in his English renderings. Miah, who was popularly known for his powerful political column in The Daily Ittefaq (founded by Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Yar Mohammad Khan) under the pen-name 'Musafir' dedicated his entire life for the cause of emancipation of the people in the then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and establishing the democracy in its truest sense. Yar Mohammad Khan invited Miah who was working at that time as a journalist at Calcutta and made him the editor of The Daily Ittefaq.. Journalist, editor, columnist and pioneer of democratic politics Miah always used his mighty pen as a weapon of struggle being inspired by patriotism, love for humanity and social responsibility. He was turned into an institution during his lifetime. Miah served as the elected president of the Pakistan branch of International Press Institute in 1963, secretary of the government-sponsored Pakistan Press Court of Honours and director of Pakistan International Airlines (1956‚Äì58).  Democratic activism  Miah was active in writing against military rule, autocracy and violation of the fundamental rights of people . Through his active involvement in the six point movement of the Awami League, and his editorials, Miah contributed greatly to the secular nationalist movement that eventually led to the creation of Bangladesh.  Six point movement  Miah played a notable role during the Six point movement of 1966. The movement‚Äîspearheaded by Awami League leadership after realizing that the East and West Pakistan were moving along divergent economic paths‚Äîtried to establish regional economic autonomy of East Pakistan. The announcement of the six point movement was supposed to be made by Shah Azizur Rahman as per the decision of Mujib himself. However, Miah felt that it should be Mujib rather than Shah Azizur Rahman who should make the announcement. Mujib's declaration of the program in 1966 elevated his position as the undisputed supreme leader in what would become the movement for independence in 1971. Between May and June 1966 almost the entire Awami League leadership was behind bars. Miah was arrested on 16 June 1966. The following day, Ittefaq was ordered closed. Death and legacy Manik Mia foundation Miah died in 1969 at the age of 58 at Rawalpindi's Intercontinental Hotel in Pakistan of cardiac arrest. He was buried at the Azimpur graveyard in present-day Dhaka, Bangladesh. His closest friend and companion at death was A.K. Rafiqul Hussain (Khair Miah Shahib). Shahib accompanied his dead body to Tejgaon Dhaka Airport. At the airport, many leaders were present to receive Miah's body. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the present Manik Miah Avenue of Dhaka was named after him.

Produced by Leon Russell, it was written and recorded during a session in March 1971 at Blue Rock Studio in New York City. The collaboration with Russell formed in part through Dylan's desire for a new sound‚Äîafter a period of immersion in country rock music‚Äîand for a change from his previous producer. The song was praised by critics for its energy and distinctive vocals, guitar, and piano. It has been interpreted as Dylan's account of his writer's block in the early 1970s, and his wish to deliver less politically engaged material and find a new balance between public and private life. A minor hit in some countries worldwide, the song was included on the 1971 Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II, and other Dylan compilation albums. In 2011, five current and former Rolling Stones appeared on a recording of \\"Watching the River Flow\\" as part of a tribute project for pianist Ian Stewart. The song has been covered by the Earl Scruggs Revue, Steve Gibbons, Colin James, Russell, and many others. Writing and recording Leon Russell (pictured in 2009) was the producer of \\"Watching the River Flow\\". Between 1967 and 1970, Bob Dylan recorded and released a series of albums that incorporated country rock elements. All were produced by Bob Johnston. During the sessions for the final of these, New Morning, Dylan decided that he did not want to continue working with Johnston. Al Kooper did uncredited production work to help Dylan finish the album. For his next recording session, Dylan asked Leon Russell, who made his name with Joe Cocker, to assist in finding a new sound. The recording session took place at Blue Rock Studio in New York City on March 16‚Äì19, 1971. Russell assembled a backing group that included Carl Radle on bass, Jesse Ed Davis on guitar, and Jim Keltner on drums. Eddie Korvin was the engineer.Korvin, Eddie. \\"Bob Dylan at Blue Rock Studio, NYC Details of 1971 multiple recording sessions by engineer and studio owner, Eddie Korvin.\\" 2014. The Bob Dylan Archive, Helmerich Center for American Research, Gilcrease Museum, University of Tulsa. On the first day in the studio, Dylan, on acoustic guitar and vocals, led the band through a rehearsal jam that included covers of \\"Spanish Harlem\\", \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\", \\"I'm A Ladies Man\\" (Hank Snow), \\"Blood Red River\\" (Josh White), and \\"I'm Alabama Bound\\" (Lead Belly version).\\"Blue Rock Studio Dylan session rehearsal reference tape.\\" Low-speed (7 1/2 IPS) 1/4\\" mono tape. 1971. The Bob Dylan Archive, Helmerich Center for American Research, Gilcrease Museum, University of Tulsa. On the second day, after a brief rehearsal, \\"Watching the River Flow\\" was recorded with Dylan singing live with the band. \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" was recorded in similar fashion on the third day, and a mixing of both songs took place on the last day. \\"Watching the River Flow\\" was based on studio jams done at Blue Rock, and uses a chord progression in the key of F major. Russell recalled that when developing the song, the basic track was formed, and that Dylan then wrote the lyrics in several minutes. Jim Keltner has also reported that Dylan wrote the songs at the Blue Rock session quickly: \\"I remember Bob ... had a pencil and a notepad, and he was writing a lot. He was writing these songs on the spot in the studio, or finishing them up at least.\\" The music of \\"Watching the River Flow\\"‚Äîwhose feel the journalist Bob Spitz has likened to Dylan's \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" (1966)‚Äîhas been described by different critics as a \\"[b]lues-powered sound [that cascades] like clumps of flotsam and jetsam\\", as \\"featur[ing] some blistering guitar work ... and rollicking piano work from Russell\\", and as \\"an energetic, funky-gospel rocker\\". The recording has been praised for the dynamic way in which Dylan's vocal mannerisms bounce off Russell's characteristic stride piano playing. Biographer Clinton Heylin has pointed out that Dylan borrowed the line \\"If I had wings and I could fly\\" from the song \\"The Water is Wide\\" and words from \\"Old Man River\\" for his composition. Four and a half months after the recording session, on August 1, Russell backed Dylan on bass at the Concert for Bangladesh, organized by George Harrison. In November 1971, Russell accompanied Dylan into a studio again to record Dylan's next single, \\"George Jackson\\". At this session, Russell once more played bass. Joe Schick, the manager of Blue Rock in 1971, has commented that although Dylan and Russell had a reasonably friendly relationship, their rapport was not strong enough to record an album together. Indeed, Heylin noted in 2009 that Russell had not recorded with Dylan again; however, they did tour together in 2011. Russell died in 2016. The b-side of \\"Watching the River Flow\\" was \\"Spanish is the Loving Tongue\\" (written by Charles Badger Clark‚ÄìBilly Simon). Dylan used the second of two takes of the song recorded during the New Morning sessions on June 2, 1970, in Columbia Studios in New York City. Musicians at these sessions included Bob Dylan, vocal, guitar, harmonica, and piano; Al Kooper, organ; Charlie Daniels, bass; David Bromberg, guitar, dobro; Russ Kunkel, drums; Ron Cornelius, guitar. Release and charts The song was released as a single on June 3, 1971. In the US, Columbia Records' promotion included a full-page Billboard advertisement, declaring the track as \\"A unique new single by Bob Dylan.\\" The advert contained a photograph of Dylan holding a camera to his eye. It was a Top 40 hit in Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and reached No. 41 on the US Billboard charts. Billboard writer Paul Grein has noted that it was the second consecutive American Dylan single, after 1970's \\"Wigwam\\", to miss the Top 40 by one spot. On November 17, 1971, \\"Watching the River Flow\\" appeared on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. It was later included on the compilations Greatest Hits, Vol. 1‚Äì3 (2003), Playlist: The Very Best of Bob Dylan '70s (2009), and Beyond Here Lies Nothin': The Collection (2011). { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - !Chart (1971) !Peak position - !scope=rowCanadian RPM Singles Chart  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"19 - !scope=rowDutch Single Top 100  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"18 - !scope=rowDutch Top 40  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"24 - !scope=rowUK Singles Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"24 - !scope=rowUS Billboard Hot 100  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"41 } Critical comments Biographer Robert Shelton wrote that in the early 1970s, Dylan was frequently criticized for \\"selling out\\" and that people were pressuring him to go back to his earlier trend of composing protest songs. For Shelton, who noted the promotional photo for \\"Watching the River Flow\\" depicting Dylan looking through a camera, the track expressed Dylan's wish just to be an observer, and not a political activist. Author Seth Rogovoy similarly interpreted the song as Dylan's desire to ignore politics and avoid getting involved in people's disputes. The line \\"[This ol' river] keeps on rollin', though/No matter ... which way the wind does blow\\" has been heard by writers Peter Vernezze and Carl J. Porter as evidence of Dylan's conviction that \\"the river of time, the flow of facts, in reality remains unaffected by winds of beliefs, the flow of changing opinions.\\" Greil Marcus highlighted the importance of disregarding one's initial reading of the song. \\"The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written\\". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is coming to terms with unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because \\"the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow ... even though that's not quite what he's saying\\". For Marcus, \\"Watching the River Flow\\" is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience. Clinton Heylin and writer Christopher Ricks discussed Dylan's restlessness in the song. Heylin said that in \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\", co-written by Dylan and Roger McGuinn two years earlier, Dylan claimed he was content to watch while \\"The river flows, flows to the sea/Wherever it flows, that's where I want to be\\"; by contrast, in \\"Watching the River Flow\\", Dylan writes that he wants to be moving, wishing he was \\"back in the city/Instead of this old bank of sand\\". Ricks found Dylan's unsettledness at odds with the implied bucolic notion of watching the river flow. For Ricks, the vocal phrasing and the musical arrangements clash with the lyrics; the \\"choppy\\" rhythms and \\"stroppy stomping\\" of the backing track, disrupt the theme of contentedly watching the river. He noted that two of the verses begin with \\"People disagreeing\\", introducing conflict into the song, and concluded that \\"Watching the River Flow\\" is \\"tarred with a realism that qualifies and complicates the lure of the lazy\\". Heylin heard in the composition Dylan's admission that in 1971 he felt uninspired about writing lyrics and had no specific ideas he wanted to voice. The biographer placed this avowal in the context of changing, polarized critical estimates of Dylan's work in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In June 1970, Dylan had released Self Portrait, an album that received very negative reviews; Dylan's next album that year, New Morning, was viewed much more favorably by critics, and Ralph Gleason declared \\"We've got Dylan back again!\\" For Heylin, Dylan's assertion in the song that he does not have any particular message to express, is an attempt to subvert critics like Gleason. Heylin wrote that both \\"Watching the River Flow\\" and \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" discuss Dylan's professed lack of inspiration at the time in an honest and satisfying way. Pointing to the fact that Dylan made no attempt to record either a single or an album in the following year of 1972, he commented that \\"Dylan had now concluded that he must simply sit by that bank of sand and await [his muse's] return.\\" Ian Bell, in his critical biography of Dylan, wrote that it was \\"no accident\\" that both \\"Watching The River Flow\\" and \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" made much the same statement. Bell argued that \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" is the better song as it is the funnier of the two. Bell heard Dylan mocking both his admirers and his own reputation in this composition, while he detected in \\"Watching The River Flow\\" an admission that \\"If creativity is a habit, Dylan was all but cured.\\" Personnel The musicians who recorded \\"Watching the River Flow\\" are: *Bob Dylan ‚Äì vocal *Leon Russell ‚Äì acoustic piano, production *Jesse Ed Davis ‚Äì electric guitar *Carl Radle (called Charlie Radle on the session notes) ‚Äì electric bass *Jim Keltner ‚Äì drums Live performances and covers Oslo, Norway, on March 30, 2007, one of hundreds of concerts where he has performed \\"Watching the River Flow\\". Dylan first performed the song live on November 21, 1978, in El Paso, Texas, and again, two days later, in Norman, Oklahoma. He did not play it in concert again until July 19, 1987, in Eugene, Oregon; from that point on, he has often included the song in his sets. According to his official website, as of July 2020 Dylan has performed the song exactly 500 times, with the last performance being on July 15, 2014 in Gothenburg, Sweden. On April 18, 2011, musician Ben Waters released the album Boogie 4 Stu, a tribute to the late Rolling Stones pianist Ian Stewart, including a version of \\"Watching the River Flow\\" featuring the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, and Ronnie Wood, as well as former member Bill Wyman. The five Rolling Stones recorded their contributions separately, in different studios at different times, but the track constituted the first time since 1992 that Wyman had recorded on the same song as his former bandmates. The choice of the song was based on Ian Stewart's judgment that \\"Watching the River Flow\\" was \\"the only decent thing Bob Dylan ever did\\". The song has been covered by numerous artists, including Seatrain (1973), the Earl Scruggs Revue (1976), Steve Gibbons (1977), Joe Cocker (1978), Steve Forbert in the I-10 Chronicles (2001), Ken Saydak (2001), Colin James (2005), Asylum Street Spankers (2006), and Steve Gadd (2010). Leon Russell released his own version in 1999 on the compilation Tangled Up in Blues.

Biography Huey was the son of Jacob Huey, a farmer in Chester County, Pennsylvania known locally as \\"The Squire of Kennett Square\\". He pursued a career as a merchant before war broke out in 1861. In September 1861, he became captain of Company D of the 8th Pennsylvania Cavalry (89th Pennsylvania Volunteers), serving under the regiment's colonel, David McMurtrie Gregg. Huey was promoted to major in January 1862. When Gregg became a brigade commander, Huey took command of the regiment and subsequently led it at the Battle of Chancellorsville, serving in the brigade of Thomas Devin. The brigade, including the 8th Pennsylvania, remained with the main body of the army, missing the futile raid George Stoneman led into south central Virginia. Huey's command became involved in a collision with Confederate infantry, from which it was only possible to extricate his troops by giving the order to; \\"Draw sabre and charge.\\" This encounter on a back road, which cost the regiment substantial losses, later was magnified into a full-scale charge for which Cavalry commander Alfred Pleasonton took credit, claiming he had explicitly ordered Major Peter Keenan to go head to head with Jackson's troops. The charge, during which Keenan was killed, was completely inadvertent; the only way to extricate a column of cavalry from a narrow road thick with Confederate infantry. Later on the evening of the charge, \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, while out scouting the area for the presence of Union troops, was inadvertently shot by South Carolina troops having mistaken him and his party for Union soldiers. After his failed raid, Stoneman was removed from command of the Cavalry Corps in the Army of the Potomac, being succeeded by Pleasonton. When the corps was reorganized later that month, Gregg took command of the new second division, mostly composed of his old division, the third. This new organization included the 8th Pennsylvania. Huey, meanwhile, had been promoted to colonel of the regiment on June 25, 1863. Huey took command of a brigade under Gregg in time for the Gettysburg Campaign. He was on detached duty during the Battle of Gettysburg protecting supply trains in Maryland, but he participated in the pursuit of the Confederate army. The brigade served under Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, not Gregg, during the pursuit. Huey returned to regimental command for most of the remainder of 1863. He led his regiment under Philip Sheridan in the opening campaigns of 1864. Huey commanded Gregg's rear guard during part of the retreat from Trevilian Station. He was captured at the Battle of Saint Mary's Church, June 24, 1864. Paroled on December 9, 1864 at Camp Asylum, Columbia, South Carolina, after imprisonment in that state, Huey resumed his command. He was made a brevet brigadier general in March 1865 and was mustered out with his regiment at Richmond, Virginia, on August 11, 1865. After the war, Huey married Elizabeth Waln Wistar, daughter of Joseph Wistar of Philadelphia, worked as a merchant and in the canal industry. He wrote his account of the charge at Chancellorsville to reclaim the credit he thought his due, contradicting Pleasonton's account of the action. Huey died on his farm at the age of 75 and was buried in Philadelphia. \\"Chapelcroft\\" Home of General Pennock Huey stood on the east side of Bustleton Ave between Murray and Fulmer Streets. ca 1892.

The Long Haul by Robert Smith III, Page 30. October 2007. Beginnings Brown began working in the music industry in the late 1980s hosting his own radio show on WKYS in Washington D.C. Brown's radio show later led to an internship at the Black Entertainment Television (BET) D.C. headquarters working in the fields of television production and talent coordination. The internship allowed Brown to write for the BET program Video Soul, where he met R&B; artist Patti LaBelle. Brown went on to write and co-produce the Big Daddy Kane and Patti LaBelle's Grammy winning hit, \\"Feels Like Another One\\". In 1998 Brown was signed to D'Angelo's music label, Cheeba Music/Virgin. After the release of Nikka Costa's Everybody Got Their Something and D'Angelo's Voodoo, Cheeba Music was eventually dropped from its parent label, Virgin Records. Tar Baby, Brown's debut album, was eventually released on Boulevard Connection Records out of Copenhagen, Denmark, in June 2001. In 2000 Brown became the musical director for Nikka Costa and toured with Nikka for three years. He also served as the first musical director for Mark Ronson. In 2002 Brown became the president and general manager of will.i.am music group. In that capacity, he oversaw the production and executive produced multi-platinum albums for The Black Eyed Peas, Fergie and Macy Gray. During this time he and will.i.am executive produced the critically acclaimed \\"Timeless\\" album for Brazilian piano virtuoso, Sergio Mendes. \\"Timeless\\" featured a wide range of superstar guest performers including Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, Q-Tip, Jill Scott, Mr. Vegas and John Legend to name a few. Timeless spawned the hit singles \\"That Heat\\" featuring Erykah Badu and the second single, \\"Mas Que Nada\\" featuring The Black Eyed Peas. That song went on to be the theme song for the Brazilian national soccer team during the 2006 World Cup in Germany. In 2006 Brown was tapped by Justin Timberlake to Co-EP/A&R; his multi-platinum Grammy award-winning \\"FutureSexLoveSounds\\". During this time he also served as manager for multi-platinum Grammy award-winning producer Timbaland. Brown launched Buddah Brown Entertainment to serve as a record label to release new product, and the first artists that were slated to be released in 2009 were hip hop-R&B; duo Ty & Kory, Lyssii (from MTV's Daddy's Girls\\"). In 2009 Brown signed a multi-year deal to be the international music producer of the High Fashion meets Rock & Roll live television special Fashion Rocks in Rio de Janeiro. The first Brazilian installment of the series included P.Diddy performing for Donatella Versace, Grace Jones performing with Marc Jacobs, Ciara performing with Givenchy and Mariah Carey performing with Calvin Klein, to name a few. In 2010, he collaborated with Jason Herbert to create a Brazilian boyband P9 who released their debut album in July 2013 by Sony Music.

The tree is constructed incrementally from samples drawn randomly from the search space and is inherently biased to grow towards large unsearched areas of the problem. RRTs were developed by Steven M. LaValle and James J. Kuffner Jr. . They easily handle problems with obstacles and differential constraints (nonholonomic and kinodynamic) and have been widely used in autonomous robotic motion planning. RRTs can be viewed as a technique to generate open-loop trajectories for nonlinear systems with state constraints. An RRT can also be considered as a Monte-Carlo method to bias search into the largest Voronoi regions of a graph in a configuration space. Some variations can even be considered stochastic fractals.http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/rrt/about.html About RRTs, by Steve LaValle Description An RRT grows a tree rooted at the starting configuration by using random samples from the search space. As each sample is drawn, a connection is attempted between it and the nearest state in the tree. If the connection is feasible (passes entirely through free space and obeys any constraints), this results in the addition of the new state to the tree. With uniform sampling of the search space, the probability of expanding an existing state is proportional to the size of its Voronoi region. As the largest Voronoi regions belong to the states on the frontier of the search, this means that the tree preferentially expands towards large unsearched areas. The length of the connection between the tree and a new state is frequently limited by a growth factor. If the random sample is further from its nearest state in the tree than this limit allows, a new state at the maximum distance from the tree along the line to the random sample is used instead of the random sample itself. The random samples can then be viewed as controlling the direction of the tree growth while the growth factor determines its rate. This maintains the space-filling bias of the RRT while limiting the size of the incremental growth. RRT growth can be biased by increasing the probability of sampling states from a specific area. Most practical implementations of RRTs make use of this to guide the search towards the planning problem goals. This is accomplished by introducing a small probability of sampling the goal to the state sampling procedure. The higher this probability, the more greedily the tree grows towards the goal. Algorithm For a general configuration space C, the algorithm in pseudocode is as follows: Input: Initial configuration qinit, number of vertices in RRT K, incremental distance Œîq) Output: RRT graph G G.init(qinit) for k = 1 to K do qrand ‚Üê RAND_CONF() qnear ‚Üê NEAREST_VERTEX(qrand, G) qnew ‚Üê NEW_CONF(qnear, qrand, Œîq) G.add_vertex(qnew) G.add_edge(qnear, qnew) return G In the algorithm above, \\"RAND_CONF\\" grabs a random configuration qrand in C. This may be replaced with a function \\"RAND_FREE_CONF\\" that uses samples in Cfree, while rejecting those in Cobs using some collision detection algorithm. \\"NEAREST_VERTEX\\" is a function that runs through all vertices v in graph G, calculates the distance between qrand and v using some measurement function thereby returning the nearest vertex. \\"NEW_CONF\\" selects a new configuration qnew by moving an incremental distance Œîq from qnear in the direction of qrand.

He gained national fame due to success of his directorial ventures Professor (1962 film), Prince (1969 film), Ek Baar Kaho and Agar Tum Na Hote. His films Amrapali starring Vyjanthimala and Agar Tum Na Hote with Rajesh Khanna in the lead role are considered as classics. Later after 2000, he had acted in movies such as Swades, Rang De Basanti, Chennai Express and Chaarfutiya Chhokare. He was the brother of Urdu playwright Yograj Tandon. Biography Lekh's father, Faqeer Chand Tandon, had studied with Prithviraj Kapoor at Khalsa High School (Lyallpur, Punjab, British India), and had been friends. Kapoor inspired Lekh to work in Bollywood. Around same time, Lekh's brother Yograj was working as assistant director and secretary to Kapoor. Lekh started as Assistant Director in Hindi movie industry in 1950s and became a director of several hit movies beginning with Professor (1962 film). Though the prestigious film Jhuk Gaya Aasman starring Rajendra Kumar and Saira Bano did not become successful at box office, they are considered classics. His successful directorial ventures at box office include Prince (1969 film), Ek Baar Kaho, Agar Tum Na Hote. His most talked about film remains Agar Tum Na Hote starring Rajesh Khanna in the main lead. Dulhan Wahi Jo Piya Man Bhaye was one of his biggest hits and the film's heroine Rameshwari told The Times of India that Tandon was involved in every aspect of the film. She also said that the film was released without any publicity. Actor Victor Banerjee, who played the leading role in his film, Doosri Dulhan, described him as a director who \\"loved his craft and could deftly weave the commercial angle in a decently-told narrative.\\" For this film Khanna received Best Actor award and Tandon received Best director award at Filmfans Association Awards in 1983.

An example of a power system is the electrical grid that provides power to homes and industry within an extended area. The electrical grid can be broadly divided into the generators that supply the power, the transmission system that carries the power from the generating centres to the load centres, and the distribution system that feeds the power to nearby homes and industries. Smaller power systems are also found in industry, hospitals, commercial buildings and homes. The majority of these systems rely upon three- phase AC power‚Äîthe standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world. Specialised power systems that do not always rely upon three-phase AC power are found in aircraft, electric rail systems, ocean liners, submarines and automobiles. History A sketch of the Pearl Street Station In 1881, two electricians built the world's first power system at Godalming in England. It was powered by two waterwheels and produced an alternating current that in turn supplied seven Siemens arc lamps at 250 volts and 34 incandescent lamps at 40 volts. However, supply to the lamps was intermittent and in 1882 Thomas Edison and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City. The Pearl Street Station initially powered around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers. The power station generated direct current and operated at a single voltage. Direct current power could not be transformed easily or efficiently to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power loss during long-distance transmission, so the maximum economic distance between the generators and load was limited to around half a mile (800 m). That same year in London, Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs demonstrated the \\"secondary generator\\"--the first transformer suitable for use in a real power system. The practical value of Gaulard and Gibbs' transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at Turin where the transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a single alternating current generator. Despite the success of the system, the pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting the primaries of the transformers in series so that active lamps would affect the brightness of other lamps further down the line. In 1885, Ott√≥ Titusz Bl√°thy working with K√°roly Zipernowsky and Miksa D√©ri perfected the secondary generator of Gaulard and Gibbs, providing it with a closed iron core and its present name: the \\"transformer\\". The three engineers went on to present a power system at the National General Exhibition of Budapest that implemented the parallel AC distribution system proposed by a British scientist in which several power transformers have their primary windings fed in parallel from a high-voltage distribution line. The system lit more than 1000 carbon filament lamps and operated successfully from May until November of that year. Also in 1885 George Westinghouse, an American entrepreneur, obtained the patent rights to the Gaulard-Gibbs transformer and imported a number of them along with a Siemens generator, and set his engineers to experimenting with them in hopes of improving them for use in a commercial power system. In 1886, one of Westinghouse's engineers, William Stanley, independently recognised the problem with connecting transformers in series as opposed to parallel and also realised that making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the voltage regulation of the secondary winding. Using this knowledge he built a multi-voltage transformer- based alternating-current power system serving multiple homes and businesses at Great Barrington, Massachusetts in 1886. The system was unreliable though (due primarily to generation issues) and short-lived.. However based on that system Westinghouse would begin installing AC transformer systems in competition with the Edison company later that year. In 1888, Westinghouse licensed Nikola Tesla's patents for a polyphase AC induction motor and transformer designs. Tesla consulted for a year at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's but it took a further four years for Westinghouse engineers to develop a workable polyphase motor and transmission system.Carlson, W. Bernard (2013). Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age, Princeton University Press, pp. 115,159,166-167 By 1889, the electric power industry was flourishing, and power companies had built thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United States and Europe. These networks were effectively dedicated to providing electric lighting. During this time the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse's companies had grown into a propaganda campaign over which form of transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior, a series of events known as the \\"war of the currents\\". In 1891, Westinghouse installed the first major power system that was designed to drive a synchronous electric motor, not just provide electric lighting, at Telluride, Colorado. On the other side of the Atlantic, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown, built the first long-distance (175 km) high-voltage (15 kV, then a record) three- phase transmission line from Lauffen am Neckar to Frankfurt am Main for the Electrical Engineering Exhibition in Frankfurt, where power was used to light lamps and run a water pump. In the United States the AC/DC competition came to an end when Edison General Electric was taken over by their chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, forming General Electric. In 1895, after a protracted decision-making process, alternating current was chosen as the transmission standard with Westinghouse building the Adams No. 1 generating station at Niagara Falls and General Electric building the three-phase alternating current power system to supply Buffalo at 11 kV. Developments in power systems continued beyond the nineteenth century. In 1936 the first experimental high voltage direct current (HVDC) line using mercury arc valves was built between Schenectady and Mechanicville, New York. HVDC had previously been achieved by series-connected direct current generators and motors (the Thury system) although this suffered from serious reliability issues. The first solid-state metal diode suitable for general power uses was developed by Ernst Presser at TeKaDe in 1928. It consisted of a layer of selenium applied on an aluminum plate. In 1957, a General Electric research group developed the first thyristor suitable for use in power applications, starting a revolution in power electronics. In that same year, Siemens demonstrated a solid-state rectifier, but it was not until the early 1970s that solid-state devices became the standard in HVDC, when GE emerged as one of the top suppliers of thyristor-based HVDC. In 1979, a European consortium including Siemens, Brown Boveri & Cie and AEG realized the record HVDC link from Cabora Bassa to Johannesburg, extending more than 1,420 km that carried 1.9 GW at 533 kV. In recent times, many important developments have come from extending innovations in the information and communications technology (ICT) field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant load flow studies could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for effective remote control of a power system's switchgear and generators.  Basics of electric power  Animation of three-phase alternating current Electric power is the product of two quantities: current and voltage. These two quantities can vary with respect to time (AC power) or can be kept at constant levels (DC power). Most refrigerators, air conditioners, pumps and industrial machinery use AC power whereas most computers and digital equipment use DC power (digital devices plugged into the mains typically have an internal or external power adapter to convert from AC to DC power). AC power has the advantage of being easy to transform between voltages and is able to be generated and utilised by brushless machinery. DC power remains the only practical choice in digital systems and can be more economical to transmit over long distances at very high voltages (see HVDC).All About Circuits [Online textbook], Tony R. Kuphaldt et al., last accessed on 17 May 2009. (also here ) The ability to easily transform the voltage of AC power is important for two reasons: Firstly, power can be transmitted over long distances with less loss at higher voltages. So in power systems where generation is distant from the load, it is desirable to step-up (increase) the voltage of power at the generation point and then step-down (decrease) the voltage near the load. Secondly, it is often more economical to install turbines that produce higher voltages than would be used by most appliances, so the ability to easily transform voltages means this mismatch between voltages can be easily managed. Solid state devices, which are products of the semiconductor revolution, make it possible to transform DC power to different voltages, build brushless DC machines and convert between AC and DC power. Nevertheless, devices utilising solid state technology are often more expensive than their traditional counterparts, so AC power remains in widespread use.  Components of power systems  = Supplies = coal- fired power stations like this All power systems have one or more sources of power. For some power systems, the source of power is external to the system but for others, it is part of the system itself‚Äîit is these internal power sources that are discussed in the remainder of this section. Direct current power can be supplied by batteries, fuel cells or photovoltaic cells. Alternating current power is typically supplied by a rotor that spins in a magnetic field in a device known as a turbo generator. There have been a wide range of techniques used to spin a turbine's rotor, from steam heated using fossil fuel (including coal, gas and oil) or nuclear energy to falling water (hydroelectric power) and wind (wind power). The speed at which the rotor spins in combination with the number of generator poles determines the frequency of the alternating current produced by the generator. All generators on a single synchronous system, for example, the national grid, rotate at sub- multiples of the same speed and so generate electric current at the same frequency. If the load on the system increases, the generators will require more torque to spin at that speed and, in a steam power station, more steam must be supplied to the turbines driving them. Thus the steam used and the fuel expended directly relate to the quantity of electrical energy supplied. An exception exists for generators incorporating power electronics such as gearless wind turbines or linked to a grid through an asynchronous tie such as a HVDC link -- these can operate at frequencies independent of the power system frequency. Depending on how the poles are fed, alternating current generators can produce a variable number of phases of power. A higher number of phases leads to more efficient power system operation but also increases the infrastructure requirements of the system. Electricity grid systems connect multiple generators operating at the same frequency: the most common being three-phase at 50 or 60 Hz. There are a range of design considerations for power supplies. These range from the obvious: How much power should the generator be able to supply? What is an acceptable length of time for starting the generator (some generators can take hours to start)? Is the availability of the power source acceptable (some renewables are only available when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing)? To the more technical: How should the generator start (some turbines act like a motor to bring themselves up to speed in which case they need an appropriate starting circuit)? What is the mechanical speed of operation for the turbine and consequently what are the number of poles required? What type of generator is suitable (synchronous or asynchronous) and what type of rotor (squirrel-cage rotor, wound rotor, salient pole rotor or cylindrical rotor)? = Loads = A toaster is a great example of a single-phase load that might appear in a residence. Toasters typically draw 2 to 10 amps at 110 to 260 volts consuming around 600 to 1200 watts of power. Power systems deliver energy to loads that perform a function. These loads range from household appliances to industrial machinery. Most loads expect a certain voltage and, for alternating current devices, a certain frequency and number of phases. The appliances found in residential settings, for example, will typically be single-phase operating at 50 or 60 Hz with a voltage between 110 and 260 volts (depending on national standards). An exception exists for larger centralized air conditioning systems as in some countries these are now typically three-phase because this allows them to operate more efficiently. All electrical appliances also have a wattage rating, which specifies the amount of power the device consumes. At any one time, the net amount of power consumed by the loads on a power system must equal the net amount of power produced by the supplies less the power lost in transmission.Electricity around the world, Conrad H. McGregor, April 2010.What are amps, watts, volts and ohms?, HowStuffWorks.com, 31 October 2000. Last accessed: 27 June 2010. Making sure that the voltage, frequency and amount of power supplied to the loads is in line with expectations is one of the great challenges of power system engineering. However it is not the only challenge, in addition to the power used by a load to do useful work (termed real power) many alternating current devices also use an additional amount of power because they cause the alternating voltage and alternating current to become slightly out-of-sync (termed reactive power). The reactive power like the real power must balance (that is the reactive power produced on a system must equal the reactive power consumed) and can be supplied from the generators, however it is often more economical to supply such power from capacitors (see \\"Capacitors and reactors\\" below for more details). A final consideration with loads has to do with power quality. In addition to sustained overvoltages and undervoltages (voltage regulation issues) as well as sustained deviations from the system frequency (frequency regulation issues), power system loads can be adversely affected by a range of temporal issues. These include voltage sags, dips and swells, transient overvoltages, flicker, high-frequency noise, phase imbalance and poor power factor.Brief power quality tutorials for engineers, PSL, accessed 21 August 2010. Power quality issues occur when the power supply to a load deviates from the ideal. Power quality issues can be especially important when it comes to specialist industrial machinery or hospital equipment. = Conductors = Partially insulated medium-voltage conductors in California Conductors carry power from the generators to the load. In a grid, conductors may be classified as belonging to the transmission system, which carries large amounts of power at high voltages (typically more than 69 kV) from the generating centres to the load centres, or the distribution system, which feeds smaller amounts of power at lower voltages (typically less than 69 kV) from the load centres to nearby homes and industry.Marshall Brain, \\"How Power Grids Work\\", howstuffworks.com, 1 April 2000. Choice of conductors is based on considerations such as cost, transmission losses and other desirable characteristics of the metal like tensile strength. Copper, with lower resistivity than aluminum, was once the conductor of choice for most power systems. However, aluminum has a lower cost for the same current carrying capacity and is now often the conductor of choice. Overhead line conductors may be reinforced with steel or aluminium alloys.Practical Applications of Electrical Conductors, Stefan Fassbinder, Deutsches Kupferinstitut, January 2010. Conductors in exterior power systems may be placed overhead or underground. Overhead conductors are usually air insulated and supported on porcelain, glass or polymer insulators. Cables used for underground transmission or building wiring are insulated with cross-linked polyethylene or other flexible insulation. Conductors are often stranded for to make them more flexible and therefore easier to install.Naval Engineering Training Series (Figure 1.6), U.S. Navy (republished by tpub.com), 2007. Conductors are typically rated for the maximum current that they can carry at a given temperature rise over ambient conditions. As current flow increases through a conductor it heats up. For insulated conductors, the rating is determined by the insulation.Conductor ampacity, All About Circuits, Tony R. Kuphaldt et al., 2000. For bare conductors, the rating is determined by the point at which the sag of the conductors would become unacceptable. = Capacitors and reactors = Templestowe substation, Melbourne, Victoria The majority of the load in a typical AC power system is inductive; the current lags behind the voltage. Since the voltage and current are out-of-phase, this leads to the emergence of an \\"imaginary\\" form of power known as reactive power. Reactive power does no measurable work but is transmitted back and forth between the reactive power source and load every cycle. This reactive power can be provided by the generators themselves but it is often cheaper to provide it through capacitors, hence capacitors are often placed near inductive loads (i.e. if not on-site at the nearest substation) to reduce current demand on the power system (i.e. increase the power factor). Reactors consume reactive power and are used to regulate voltage on long transmission lines. In light load conditions, where the loading on transmission lines is well below the surge impedance loading, the efficiency of the power system may actually be improved by switching in reactors. Reactors installed in series in a power system also limit rushes of current flow, small reactors are therefore almost always installed in series with capacitors to limit the current rush associated with switching in a capacitor. Series reactors can also be used to limit fault currents. Capacitors and reactors are switched by circuit breakers, which results in moderately large step changes of reactive power. A solution to this comes in the form of synchronous condensers, static VAR compensators and static synchronous compensators. Briefly, synchronous condensers are synchronous motors that spin freely to generate or absorb reactive power.B. M. Weedy, Electric Power Systems Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, London, 1972, page 149 Static VAR compensators work by switching in capacitors using thyristors as opposed to circuit breakers allowing capacitors to be switched-in and switched-out within a single cycle. This provides a far more refined response than circuit-breaker-switched capacitors. Static synchronous compensators take this a step further by achieving reactive power adjustments using only power electronics. = Power electronics = This external household AC to DC power adapter uses power electronics Power electronics are semiconductor based devices that are able to switch quantities of power ranging from a few hundred watts to several hundred megawatts. Despite their relatively simple function, their speed of operation (typically in the order of nanosecondsSwitching Characteristics of Thyristors During Turn-On , [electricalandelectronics.org], April 9, 2009.) means they are capable of a wide range of tasks that would be difficult or impossible with conventional technology. The classic function of power electronics is rectification, or the conversion of AC-to-DC power, power electronics are therefore found in almost every digital device that is supplied from an AC source either as an adapter that plugs into the wall (see photo) or as component internal to the device. High-powered power electronics can also be used to convert AC power to DC power for long distance transmission in a system known as HVDC. HVDC is used because it proves to be more economical than similar high voltage AC systems for very long distances (hundreds to thousands of kilometres). HVDC is also desirable for interconnects because it allows frequency independence thus improving system stability. Power electronics are also essential for any power source that is required to produce an AC output but that by its nature produces a DC output. They are therefore used by photovoltaic installations. Power electronics also feature in a wide range of more exotic uses. They are at the heart of all modern electric and hybrid vehicles‚Äîwhere they are used for both motor control and as part of the brushless DC motor. Power electronics are also found in practically all modern petrol-powered vehicles, this is because the power provided by the car's batteries alone is insufficient to provide ignition, air-conditioning, internal lighting, radio and dashboard displays for the life of the car. So the batteries must be recharged while driving‚Äîa feat that is typically accomplished using power electronics. Whereas conventional technology would be unsuitable for a modern electric car, commutators can and have been used in petrol-powered cars, the switch to alternators in combination with power electronics has occurred because of the improved durability of brushless machinery. Some electric railway systems also use DC power and thus make use of power electronics to feed grid power to the locomotives and often for speed control of the locomotive's motor. In the middle twentieth century, rectifier locomotives were popular, these used power electronics to convert AC power from the railway network for use by a DC motor. Today most electric locomotives are supplied with AC power and run using AC motors, but still use power electronics to provide suitable motor control. The use of power electronics to assist with the motor control and with starter circuits, in addition to rectification, is responsible for power electronics appearing in a wide range of industrial machinery. Power electronics even appear in modern residential air conditioners allow are at the heart of the variable speed wind turbine. = Protective devices = A multifunction digital protective relay typically installed at a substation to protect a distribution feeder Power systems contain protective devices to prevent injury or damage during failures. The quintessential protective device is the fuse. When the current through a fuse exceeds a certain threshold, the fuse element melts, producing an arc across the resulting gap that is then extinguished, interrupting the circuit. Given that fuses can be built as the weak point of a system, fuses are ideal for protecting circuitry from damage. Fuses however have two problems: First, after they have functioned, fuses must be replaced as they cannot be reset. This can prove inconvenient if the fuse is at a remote site or a spare fuse is not on hand. And second, fuses are typically inadequate as the sole safety device in most power systems as they allow current flows well in excess of that that would prove lethal to a human or animal. The first problem is resolved by the use of circuit breakers‚Äîdevices that can be reset after they have broken current flow. In modern systems that use less than about 10 kW, miniature circuit breakers are typically used. These devices combine the mechanism that initiates the trip (by sensing excess current) as well as the mechanism that breaks the current flow in a single unit. Some miniature circuit breakers operate solely on the basis of electromagnetism. In these miniature circuit breakers, the current is run through a solenoid, and, in the event of excess current flow, the magnetic pull of the solenoid is sufficient to force open the circuit breaker's contacts (often indirectly through a tripping mechanism). A better design, however, arises by inserting a bimetallic strip before the solenoid‚Äîthis means that instead of always producing a magnetic force, the solenoid only produces a magnetic force when the current is strong enough to deform the bimetallic strip and complete the solenoid's circuit. In higher powered applications, the protective relays that detect a fault and initiate a trip are separate from the circuit breaker. Early relays worked based upon electromagnetic principles similar to those mentioned in the previous paragraph, modern relays are application-specific computers that determine whether to trip based upon readings from the power system. Different relays will initiate trips depending upon different protection schemes. For example, an overcurrent relay might initiate a trip if the current on any phase exceeds a certain threshold whereas a set of differential relays might initiate a trip if the sum of currents between them indicates there may be current leaking to earth. The circuit breakers in higher powered applications are different too. Air is typically no longer sufficient to quench the arc that forms when the contacts are forced open so a variety of techniques are used. One of the most popular techniques is to keep the chamber enclosing the contacts flooded with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)‚Äîa non-toxic gas with sound arc-quenching properties. Other techniques are discussed in the reference.http://ocw.kfupm.edu.sa/user/EE46603/Circuit%20Breakers.pdf The second problem, the inadequacy of fuses to act as the sole safety device in most power systems, is probably best resolved by the use of residual current devices (RCDs). In any properly functioning electrical appliance, the current flowing into the appliance on the active line should equal the current flowing out of the appliance on the neutral line. A residual current device works by monitoring the active and neutral lines and tripping the active line if it notices a difference.How does an RCD work? , PowerBreaker, accessed on 14-Mar-10. Residual current devices require a separate neutral line for each phase and to be able to trip within a time frame before harm occurs. This is typically not a problem in most residential applications where standard wiring provides an active and neutral line for each appliance (that's why your power plugs always have at least two tongs) and the voltages are relatively low however these issues limit the effectiveness of RCDs in other applications such as industry. Even with the installation of an RCD, exposure to electricity can still prove fatal. = SCADA systems = In large electric power systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is used for tasks such as switching on generators, controlling generator output and switching in or out system elements for maintenance. The first supervisory control systems implemented consisted of a panel of lamps and switches at a central console near the controlled plant. The lamps provided feedback on the state of the plant (the data acquisition function) and the switches allowed adjustments to the plant to be made (the supervisory control function). Today, SCADA systems are much more sophisticated and, due to advances in communication systems, the consoles controlling the plant no longer need to be near the plant itself. Instead, it is now common for plants to be controlled with equipment similar (if not identical) to a desktop computer. The ability to control such plants through computers has increased the need for security‚Äîthere have already been reports of cyber-attacks on such systems causing significant disruptions to power systems.Report: hack on Ukraine's power grid , Kim Zetter, WIRED, March 3, 2016.  Power systems in practice  Despite their common components, power systems vary widely both with respect to their design and how they operate. This section introduces some common power system types and briefly explains their operation. = Residential power systems = Residential dwellings almost always take supply from the low voltage distribution lines or cables that run past the dwelling. These operate at voltages of between 110 and 260 volts (phase-to-earth) depending upon national standards. A few decades ago small dwellings would be fed a single phase using a dedicated two-core service cable (one core for the active phase and one core for the neutral return). The active line would then be run through a main isolating switch in the fuse box and then split into one or more circuits to feed lighting and appliances inside the house. By convention, the lighting and appliance circuits are kept separate so the failure of an appliance does not leave the dwelling's occupants in the dark. All circuits would be fused with an appropriate fuse based upon the wire size used for that circuit. Circuits would have both an active and neutral wire with both the lighting and power sockets being connected in parallel. Sockets would also be provided with a protective earth. This would be made available to appliances to connect to any metallic casing. If this casing were to become live, the theory is the connection to earth would cause an RCD or fuse to trip‚Äîthus preventing the future electrocution of an occupant handling the appliance. Earthing systems vary between regions, but in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia both the protective earth and neutral line would be earthed together near the fuse box before the main isolating switch and the neutral earthed once again back at the distribution transformer. There have been a number of minor changes over the years to practice of residential wiring. Some of the most significant ways modern residential power systems in developed countries tend to vary from older ones include: * For convenience, miniature circuit breakers are now almost always used in the fuse box instead of fuses as these can easily be reset by occupants and, if of the thermomagnetic type, can respond more quickly to some types of fault. * For safety reasons, RCDs are now often installed on appliance circuits and, increasingly, even on lighting circuits. * Whereas residential air conditioners of the past might have been fed from a dedicated circuit attached to a single phase, larger centralised air conditioners that require three- phase power are now becoming common in some countries. * Protective earths are now run with lighting circuits to allow for metallic lamp holders to be earthed. * Increasingly residential power systems are incorporating microgenerators, most notably, photovoltaic cells. = Commercial power systems = Commercial power systems such as shopping centers or high-rise buildings are larger in scale than residential systems. Electrical designs for larger commercial systems are usually studied for load flow, short-circuit fault levels, and voltage drop for steady-state loads and during starting of large motors. The objectives of the studies are to assure proper equipment and conductor sizing, and to coordinate protective devices so that minimal disruption is caused when a fault is cleared. Large commercial installations will have an orderly system of sub-panels, separate from the main distribution board to allow for better system protection and more efficient electrical installation. Typically one of the largest appliances connected to a commercial power system in hot climates is the HVAC unit, and ensuring this unit is adequately supplied is an important consideration in commercial power systems. Regulations for commercial establishments place other requirements on commercial systems that are not placed on residential systems. For example, in Australia, commercial systems must comply with AS 2293, the standard for emergency lighting, which requires emergency lighting be maintained for at least 90 minutes in the event of loss of mains supply. In the United States, the National Electrical Code requires commercial systems to be built with at least one 20 A sign outlet in order to light outdoor signage. Building code regulations may place special requirements on the electrical system for emergency lighting, evacuation, emergency power, smoke control and fire protection.  Power system management  Power system management varies depending upon the power system. Residential power systems and even automotive electrical systems are often run-to-fail. In aviation, the power system uses redundancy to ensure availability. On the Boeing 747-400 any of the four engines can provide power and circuit breakers are checked as part of power-up (a tripped circuit breaker indicating a fault). Larger power systems require active management. In industrial plants or mining sites a single team might be responsible for fault management, augmentation and maintenance. Where as for the electric grid, management is divided amongst several specialised teams. = Fault management = Fault management involves monitoring the behaviour of the power system so as to identify and correct issues that affect the system's reliability. Fault management can be specific and reactive: for example, dispatching a team to restring conductor that has been brought down during a storm. Or, alternatively, can focus on systemic improvements: such as the installation of reclosers on sections of the system that are subject to frequent temporary disruptions (as might be caused by vegetation, lightning or wildlife). = Maintenance and augmentation = In addition to fault management, power systems may require maintenance or augmentation. As often it is neither economical nor practical for large parts of the system to be offline during this work, power systems are built with many switches. These switches allow the part of the system being worked on to be isolated while the rest of the system remains live. At high voltages, there are two switches of note: isolators and circuit breakers. Circuit breakers are load-breaking switches where as operating isolators under load would lead to unacceptable and dangerous arcing. In a typical planned outage, several circuit breakers are tripped to allow the isolators to be switched before the circuit breakers are again closed to reroute power around the isolated area. This allows work to be completed on the isolated area. = Frequency and voltage management = Beyond fault management and maintenance one of the main difficulties in power systems is that the active power consumed plus losses must equal the active power produced. If load is reduced while generation inputs remain constant the synchronous generators will spin faster and the system frequency will rise. The opposite occurs if load is increased. As such the system frequency must be actively managed primarily through switching on and off dispatchable loads and generation. Making sure the frequency is constant is usually the task of a system operator.S. Stoft. Power System Economics. IEEE Press, 2002. Even with frequency maintained, the system operator can be kept occupied ensuring: Notes See also * Power system simulation References  External links  * IEEE Power Engineering Society * Power Engineering International Magazine Articles * Power Engineering Magazine Articles * American Society of Power Engineers, Inc. * National Institute for the Uniform Licensing of Power Engineer Inc.

He was known to have been one of the ablest and most resolute leaders of the insurrection. He first commanded in Apulia where he was very successful: Canusium and Venusia, with many other towns, opened their gates to him, and some which refused to obey him he took by force. He executed the Roman nobles who were made prisoners, and enrolled the common people and slaves among his troops. Judacilius joined with Titus Afranius (also called Lafrenius) and Publius Ventidius Bassus at Mount Falerinus, where they defeated Pompeius Strabo, who retreated to Firmum, after which the three went their separate ways. When Strabo had in his turn gained a victory over Afranius and laid siege to Picenum, Judacilius, anxious to save his native town, hastened to the city with eight cohorts. He sent word beforehand to the inhabitants that when they saw him advancing at a distance they should make a sally against Strabo's besieging force, so that the enemy should be attacked on both sides at once. The inhabitants were afraid to do so, and a massive and bloody battle ensued between the two forces; Roman reports of the battle speak of 75,000 soldiers on the Roman side against 60,000 Italians, although most scholars consider these numbers exaggerated. Judacilius nevertheless cut his way through the enemy's lines and into the city. However his plan of seriously wounding the opposing force had failed. He had succeeded only in barricading his forces in with the defenders. Finding that the city could not possibly hold out much longer, and resolved not to survive its fall, he first put to death all his enemies, including those of Asculum he thought had discouraged the townsfolk from rallying to the fight, and then erected a funeral pyre within the precincts of the chief temple in the city.Florus, iii. 18 Judacilius then he feasted with his friends, and, after taking poison, he laid himself down on the pile, and commanded his friends to set it on fire.Appian, Civil Wars i. 40, 42, 47, 48Orosius, v. 18 The town shortly thereafter fell into the hands of Pompey and was severely punished for its resistance.

His father was Crimean Khan Mengli Giray. He was placed on the Kazan throne by his ambitious brother Mehmed of Crimea and driven out of Kazan by the Russians. He became Crimean Khan with Turkish support and was expelled by the Turks for disobedience. During his reign Crimean troops fought for the Turks and also fought in the North Caucasus. In 1532-1584, during the long reigns of Sahib I, Devlet I and Mehmed II, Crimea was at the height of its power. Family and early life His grandfather was Hacƒ± I Giray (c. 1441‚Äì1466), the founder of the dynasty. His father was Mengli Giray (1478‚Äì1515). Mengli‚Äôs sons included Mehmed I Giray (1515‚Äì1523), Saadet I Giray (1524‚Äì1532), Sahib I Giray (1532‚Äì1551) and Mubarak. ƒûazƒ± I Giray (1523‚Äì24) and ƒ∞sl√¢m I Giray (1532) were sons of Mehmed. His successor, Devlet I Giray (1551‚Äì1577), was a son of Mubarak. His wives were Fatima Sultan and Khanbike Sultan, sister of the Circassian Prince Mashuk Kanukov. His mother-in-law Nur- Sultan was the mother of Muhammed Amin of Kazan. His Kalgas (deputy and designated heir) were his nephew Islyam I Giray, Saadet's son Akhmed and his son Emin. In 1510‚Äì11 he accompanied his mother-in-law Nur Sultan to Moscow and Kazan. During the reign of Mehmed Giray (1515‚Äì1523) he was imprisoned for a long time. Khan of Kazan (1521‚Äì1524) The khanate of Kazan was unstable and usually alternated between pro- and anti-Russian khans. By custom, khans had to be descendants of Genghis, which Sahib was. After the death of Mohammad Amin (1502‚Äì19) the anti-Russian faction wanted to bring Sahib from Crimea, but the Russians imposed their vassal Shahgali (1519‚Äì1521). In the spring of 1521, at the request of the anti-Russian faction, Sahib entered Kazan and Shahgali fled to Muscovy. To return to Crimea, the ambitious Mehmed of Crimea had now placed his brother on the throne of Kazan. The next step was to take the Khanate of Astrakhan, which he did in 1523. The Nogais feared Mehmed's growing power and killed him. Crimea passed to Mehmed‚Äôs son Gazi, who was quickly replaced by Mehmed‚Äôs and Sahib‚Äôs brother Saadet I Giray (1524‚Äì1532). Saadet was more cautious than his brother Mehmed, wanted to consolidate his rule in Crimea and gave little support to his brother in Kazan. To return to Kazan, in the summer of 1521 khans Mehmed of Crimea and Sahib of Kazan made a joint raid on Muscovy. Sahib raided Nizhny Novgorod and Vladimir, joined his brother Mehmed and raided the outskirts of Moscow. They took a huge number of captives and returned to their khanates. In the autumn of 1522 Sahib raided eastern Muscovy. In August-September 1523 Moscow sent a force down the Volga under Shahgali. It plundered villages along the river, reached Kazan and turned back. In September Russia founded the advanced fort of Vasilsursk. In October Sahib raided Galich and returned with many prisoners. (? Galich is rather far north.) Sahib sent an ambassador to Saadat, the new khan of Crimea, asking for cannon, muskets (?–ø–∏—â–∞–ª–∏) and Janissaries. Saadet refused. In the spring of 1524 Sahib declared himself an Ottoman vassal, but this did not help. In the spring of 1524 Moscow sent a huge army under Ivan Belsky against Kazan. Sahib fled. He was replaced by Safa Giray of Kazan, said to be the son of Sahib's brother Fetikh. Return to Crimea (1524‚Äì1532) In the summer of 1524 Sahib reached Crimea, where Saadet imprisoned him. In autumn he was released and assisted Saadet against their rebellious nephew Islyam I Giray. In 1525‚Äì26 and 1528‚Äì1530 he was Saadet‚Äôs Kalga. In 1531 he helped defeat the Shirin clan. Howorth (1880Howorth, p. 479 following Hammar-Purgstall) has him make a pilgrimage to Mecca and in 1532 accompany Sulieman in a war in Hungary. Khan of Crimea (1532‚Äì1551) Enthronement and struggle with Islyam: In May 1532 Saadet I Giray voluntarily renounced the khanship and left for Istanbul. ƒ∞sl√¢m I Giray returned to Crimea and was proclaimed khan. The sultan did not recognize him and in the fall appointed Sahib as Crimean khan. He arrived with Turkish troops and was recognized by the Crimean nobles. Islyam, after a five- month reign, became Sahib's Kalga and was given Perekop and Ochakov. In the spring of 1534 Islyam revolted. He was repulsed from Crimea and fortified himself in Perekop. Saadet‚Äôs son Akhmed was made Kalga, but was killed in 1537 by Sahib‚Äôs order. Sahib‚Äôs son Emin became Kalga. In 1537 Sahib drove Islyam out of Perekop. He fled to the Nogais and was killed by Baki-Beg, the Karachi Beg of the Mangit clan. Domestic policy: He founded the new capital of Bakhchisarai 2km downstream from the old capital of Salachik. (The capitals had been the nearby cliff-fort of Chufut-Kale and before that Stary Krym.) He expanded the harbor of Gozlev/Yevpatoria, giving the khanate its own port. He tried to weaken the great nobles by bringing their leaders to court and elevating the lesser nobles. He tried to sedentarize the Nogais. Wars: When he went to war he was accompanied by a guard of musketeers, wagons and field artillery. The main force was tribal cavalry. In 1538 he joined Suliman the Magnificent to fight the Moldavian ruler Petru Rare»ô. The result was the Ottoman occupation of Ochakov and the separation of the Budjak coast from Moldavia. In 1539 he marched to the Taman peninsula to punish the Circassians for attacks on Muslims. Kansavuk, the leader of the Zhaney tribe, bought him off with gifts to the Khan, Sultan and Turkish governor of Kaffa. A search in the mountains for the guilty parties failed. On the way back the Crimeans looted some Circassian villages. In the winter of 1539/40 Sahib and his son Emin raided Lithuania and possibly Muscovy. The campaign was successful, but the returning troops suffered much from the cold. In 1541 they raided Muscovy. The runaway Prince Semyon Belsky promised to show them a ford over the Oka River, but they were late due to quarrels between Sahib and Baki-Beg, the Russians blocked the river bank with artillery and the Crimeans went home, taking a little loot. In 1542 they returned to the North Caucasus because Kansavuk had not fulfilled his promises, including the delivery of slaves. They entered the mountains, were attacked at night, won, and returned with much loot. 1544 the Kabardian Prince Elbozady, arrived in Crimea asking for help against his rebellious subjects. The Tatars marched east, defeated a night attack by the Kabardians and returned with many captives. In 1545 Astrakhan was captured and Yamghurchi of Astrakhan was driven out. In 1546 10000 Nogais under Ali-Mirza attacked Crimea to avenge the capture of Astrakhan. The Crimeans surrounded them near Perekop and utterly defeated them by blasting them with artillery and musket fire. After the battle Sahib ordered many of the prisoners executed. Overthrow and death (1551) Some time before 1551 Sahib had requested that his nephew Devlet Devlet I Giray) be sent from Istanbul so that he could be made khan of Kazan. In reality, Sahib was trying to gain control of a potential rival. In 1551 Sulieman the Magnificent ordered Sahib to march against Persia. This was much further east than the Crimeans had ever gone. Sahib replied that his warriors were poor, poorly dressed and could not withstand a long march. The sultan began to doubt the loyalty of his vassal and decided to replace him with Devlet. Sahib was told that Devlet was appointed Khan of KazanHoworth, p488 has Astrakhan and that Sahib should march against the Zhaney tribe of Circassians who had revolted and were attacking pilgrims returning from Mecca. Before leaving, Sahib sent a large force under Emin, his son and Kalga, to Perekop to guard against an attack while his army was away. Sahib crossed to the Taman Peninsula, chased the culprits into the mountains, won a battle and took a large amount of loot and captives. Meanwhile Devlet arrived by land at Akkerman with 1000 Janissaries and 60 cannon. He took ship to Gozlev (Evpatoria), marched southeast and captured Bakhchiserai. When Emin learned of this he marched south but only got to the Alma River (it flows west to the sea between Evpatoria and Sevastopol). His whole army went over to Devlet and Emin was killed. When word of the coup reached Sahib he was abandoned by his army. He was imprisoned in the fortress of Taman and killed by his great nephew Bulyuk Giray under orders from Devlet. All of Sahib‚Äôs children and grandchildren to be killed by order of Devlet. Devlet buried him with honors at Salachik near Bakhchisarai. Devlet I Giray (1551‚Äì1577) became khan.

Known to his colleagues by the nicknames \\"Os\\" or \\"Ossie\\", Morris' career in cinematography spanned six decades. Life and career Morris was raised in Middlesex (now the London Borough of Hillingdon), and attended the Bishopshalt School. His interest in film began at an early age; during summer vacations, he would work as a projectionist at the local cinema. Dropping out in 1932, he started working in the film industry at Wembley Studios as an unpaid gofer for Michael Powell, among others, eventually graduating to the positions of clapper boy and camera assistant on quota quickies. By his 20s, Morris was a camera operator, first at Wembley, and later at Elstree. His career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served as a bomber pilot with the RAF, achieving the rank of flight lieutenant and winning both the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Force Cross. After his war service, Morris worked at Pinewood Studios as an assistant to such people as Ronald Neame and David Lean at their company Cineguild. He was the camera operator during the shooting of Lean's Oliver Twist (1948). He first acted as director of photography on Golden Salamander (1950). Neame referred to Morris as \\"probably the greatest cameraman in the world\\". Morris collaborated with film director John Huston on eight films, beginning with Moulin Rouge (1952), and also including Moby Dick (1956). Although his previous experience with Technicolor had been limited, for Moulin Rouge he devised many stylish effects - through the use of diffused and filtered light, fog, and bold color choices - for the film, and his innovations drew critical praise from the critics. For Moby Dick, Morris developed what David Peloquin has called a \\"retro-silvered pictorial\\" which \\"was designed to capture the look of nineteenth-century whaling prints with their muted colors and silver sheen\\". Morris wrote in his autobiography that he and Huston wanted a \\"soft wash\\" effect \\"in which we would etch in the characters\\". To achieve this, in prints for the original release, colour was effectively printed over a black and white image using two negatives. For the film of John Osborne's The Entertainer (1960), on which Morris was the cinematographer, his name was incorporated into the story in one scene where a radio transmission mentioned the fictional \\"Sergeant Ossie Morris\\". He received three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, for his work on the musicals Oliver! (1968), Fiddler on the Roof (1971), and The Wiz (1978), and won the award for his work on Fiddler on the Roof. Morris' brother Reginald Herbert Morris was also a cinematographer based in Canada. Morris was a Fellow of The Royal Photographic Society and was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1998. He published his memoirs, Huston, We Have a Problem: A Kaleidoscope of Filmmaking Memories (), in 2006. In his later years, Morris participated in the film course at Bournemouth University. Morris was married twice. His first marriage to the former Connie Sharp produced three children, Gillian, Christine and Roger. The marriage lasted from 1939 until she died in 1963. In 1966, Morris married Lee Turner a member of the continuity production staff on the Franco Zeffirelli film of The Taming of the Shrew (1967). This marriage lasted until she died in 2003. His survivors included his three children, 10 grandchildren, and 18 great- grandchildren. He was one of the interviewees in the book Conversations with Cinematographers by David A. Ellis, published by Scarecrow Press. Honours In June 2009, the recently completed central building of the National Film and Television School was officially named The Oswald Morris Building in his honour.

In an article dated April 8, 1990 in the Miami Herald, Napp was looking to make a comeback with the Big Daddy's name by opening a location on Washington Avenue in Miami Beach. Napp died in November 1990, theoretically ending chances of revival. History The first Big Daddy's Restaurant opened in 1964, and was located on Coney Island Avenue in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, NY. It was known to be the only true competitor of Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs. The driving force behind Big Daddy's success was the partnership of Murray L. Handwerker, the nephew of Nathan Handwerker, founder of Nathan's Famous and Robert \\"Big Daddy\\" Napp. In addition to serving hot dogs and crinkle-cut French fries, Big Daddy's also served pizza, chow mein on a bun, roasted pork sandwiches, and had a full deli as well as a clam bar. The restaurant was known for its decor of red and white candy stripes and pictures of partner Robert Napp surrounded by the famous celebrities of that era. It was also known for offering kiddie rides in the parking lot to create a Coney Island atmosphere. In the 1968 film Bye Bye Braverman, a scene was shot with actor George Segal in front of Big Daddy's as well as on location throughout the borough of Brooklyn. During the mid-1970s Miami club fighter Jerry Powers whose claim to fame was 44 fights in one year worked at Big Daddy's Restaurant on Lincoln Road in Miami Beach. Drummer Howie Fields, who played with the legendary Harry Chapin, had his doubts about the Broadway show The Night That Made America Famous until, according to his website: \\"... late one cold night in Dec '74, eating a burger/fries/coke in a now defunct Brooklyn hot dog place called Big Daddy's (on Coney Island Avenue in Sheepshead Bay where I lived), thumbing through the free newspaper 'Good Times', coming across this tiny blurb, and being thrilled because, up until that moment, there was still some doubt in my mind as to whether the whole Broadway show thing was really going to happen.\\" Locations The Big Daddy's in Sheepshead Bay closed in 1977, The Lincoln Road Mall location closed in 1986, and the location on Washington Avenue on South Beach closed around 1991. Quotes Former Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz said on his official web-site \\"You know you're from Brooklyn if......You Went to Big Daddy's on Coney Island Avenue as a change from Nathan's\\". Ownership One of the original partners, Murray L. Handwerker died on October 21, 1971 at the age of 47 leaving behind his wife and three children. In an article by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) News dated January 7, 1970, Napp and Handwerker filed a registration with the SEC seeking to take the company public, although nothing ever materialized. Robert \\"Big Daddy\\" Napp unsuccessfully ran for the Miami Beach City Council in a popular election in 1977 where he lost by only 244 votes. Napp later said there were 710 overvotes unread by the machine, but no court would listen to him. In an article dated April 8, 1990 in the Miami Herald, Napp was looking to make a comeback with the Big Daddy's name by opening a location on Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.

Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Company. (accessed: January 13, 2008). is typically a distinctive symbol required to be worn by a specific group or an individual for the purpose of public humiliation, ostracism or persecution. The term is also used metaphorically, especially in a pejorative sense, to characterize something associated with a person or group as shameful. In England, under the Poor Act 1697, paupers in receipt of parish relief were required to wear a badge of blue or red cloth on the shoulder of the right sleeve in an open and visible manner, in order to discourage people from collecting relief unless they were desperate, as while many would be willing to collect relief, few would be willing to do so if required to wear the \\"shameful\\" mark of the poor in public. The yellow badge that Jews were required to wear in parts of Europe during the Middle Ages, and later in Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe, was effectively a badge of shame, as well as identification. Other identifying marks may include making shamed people go barefoot. The biblical \\"Mark of Cain\\" can be interpreted as synonymous with a badge of shame. History =Depilation= Punitive depilation of men, especially burning off pubic hair, was intended as a mark of shame in ancient Mediterranean cultures where male body hair was valued. Women who committed adultery have also been forced to wear specific icons or marks, or had their hair shorn, as a badge of shame. Many women who fraternized with the occupiers in German-occupied Europe had their heads shaved by angry mobs of their peers after liberation by the Allies of World War II. During World War II, the Nazis also used head shaving as a mark of shame to punish Germans like the youthful non-conformists known as the Edelweiss Pirates. =Clothing= Cathar yellow cross for radicals In Ancient Rome, both men and women originally wore the toga, but over time matrons adopted the stola as the preferred form of dress, while prostitutes retained the toga. Later, under the Lex Julia, women convicted of prostitution were forced to wear a toga muliebris, as the prostitute's badge of shame. At the beginning of the 13th century, Pope Innocent III prohibited Christians from causing Jews bodily harm, but supported their segregation in society. On at least one occasion he likened this to the fate of Cain as it is described in the Book of Genesis, writing to the Count of Nevers: Prisoners in Utah c.1885 wearing striped prison uniforms considered a badge of shame After Innocent III later presided over the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215, the council adopted canon 68, requiring Jews (and Muslims) to dress distinctively to prevent interfaith relations. This canon was largely ignored by the secular governments of Europe until 1269 when King Louis IX of France, later Saint Louis, was persuaded to decree that French Jews must wear round yellow badges on their breasts and backs. After the Albigensian Crusade ended in 1229, the subsequent Papal inquisition of Pope Gregory IX imposed the ecclesiastical penance of the Cathar yellow cross as a badge of shame to be worn by the remaining repentant Cathars convicted of heresy. In colonial New England during the 17th and 18th centuries, courts required people who were convicted of sexual immorality to wear the letter \\"A\\" or the letters \\"AD\\" for adultery and the letter \\"I\\" for incest on their clothing. alt= Striped prison uniforms were commonly used in the 19th century, as a way to instantly mark escaping convicts. Modern orange prison uniforms serve the same purpose, but with a highly visible bright color in order to make it difficult for escaping convicts to hide them. The use of stripes was adopted because simple one-color uniforms could easily be dyed with another color; however, dying a striped uniform cannot hide the stripes. They were temporarily abolished in the United States early in the 20th century because their use as a badge of shame was considered undesirable because they were causing constant feelings of embarrassment and exasperation to the prisoners. They came back into use because the public's viewpoint changed. In many of today's jails and prisons in the United States, inmates are forced to wear striped prison uniforms. A prominent example of this practice exists in the Maricopa County Jail which is under the administration of Joe Arpaio, there, black and white stripes are used. Another predominantly used color scheme consists of orange and white stripes. A person who wears this kind of clothing is distinctly marked and as a result, he or she can unmistakably be identified as a prison inmate from a far distance, which allows citizens to instantly identify escapees and notify the authorities. =Skin= Societies have marked people directly in the practice generally known as being \\"branded a criminal\\". Criminals and slaves have been marked with tattoos. Sexual immorality in colonial New England was also punished by human branding with a hot iron, by having the marks burned into the skin of the face or forehead for all to see. A child wearing a dunce cap in class, from a staged photo c.1906 The practice of human branding with visible marks on the face had been firmly established by King Edward VI of England under the 1547 Statute of Vagabonds, which specified the burning of the letter \\"S\\" on the cheek or forehead of an escaped slave, and the letter \\"F\\" for \\"fraymaker\\" on the cheek of a church brawler. James Nayler, an English Quaker convicted of blasphemy in 1656, was famously branded with a \\"B\\" on his forehead. The practice of human branding was abolished in England by 1829. It continued in the United States until at least 1864, during the American Civil War, when the faces of some deserters from the Union Army were branded with the letter \\"D\\" as a mark of shame that was intended to discourage others from deserting. Runaway slaves could be branded with an \\"R\\" for \\"runaway\\", which had the effect of ensuring he or she was watched closely and often prejudiced against by any subsequent owners and overseers. =Headwear= In old- fashioned French schoolrooms, misbehaving students were sent to sit in a corner of the room wearing a sign that said \\"√Çne\\", meaning donkey, and were forced to wear a jester's cap with donkey's ears, sometimes conical in shape, known as a \\"bonnet d'√¢ne\\", meaning \\"donkey's cap\\". In traditional British and American schoolrooms, the tall conical \\"dunce cap\\", often marked with the letter \\"D\\", was used as the badge of shame for disfavored students. The dunce cap is no longer used in modern education. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, individuals accused of being counter-revolutionaries were publicly humiliated by being forced to wear dunce caps with their war crimes written on them.Lawson, Alastair. \\"Rare Chinese Cultural Revolution photos on display,\\" BBC News, Saturday, October 13, 2012. Retrieved April 23, 2018 =Barefoot= Depiction of barefooted and partly fettered prisoners by Cornelis de Wael; To Visit the Imprisoned c. 1640 Barefooted prisoner in iron restraints; Wales 19th century (museum exhibit) Barefooted or naked oriental slaves (Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me - The Slave Market) In former times prisoners were routinely divested of large parts of their clothing and hereby left with usually covered body parts exposed. This was primarily done to visually earmark the captive individuals so onlookers could distinguish their status upon first sight. It also had a symbolistic connotation in those divesting prisoners of their clothes meant divesting them of their rights and social status. Notably taking away the footwear of an unfree person and thereby forcing him or her to remain in bare feet has been used for visibly marking captives, prisoners and slaves in almost every culture. This customary practice is still commonplace in prisons of many countries. As shoes in their various appearances have been worn throughout all social classes since earliest human history, forcibly presenting a person to the public in bare feet is a common method to showcase a person's loss of status or absence of rights. As bare feet are a highly noticeable visual attribute in almost every social situation, this particular form of appearance often incidentally raises suspicion or disdain among bystanders. It also serves to dishearten prisoners and frustrate attempts of escape. The ability to walk or run quickly is hereby often drastically reduced. As the feet are the only body part with near permanent contact to the environment, their lack of protection can have a victimizing effect and make the person feel physically defeated, helpless or vulnerable which adds to the shaming effect. Wearing shoes is a low-level and natural manifestation of civil rights and liberties, which cannot be revoked from free citizens of any culture under normal circumstances. Even when suffering neediness in ancient history, simple forms of footwear were handmade from available materials, while today simple shoes are sufficiently inexpensive to be purchased in practically every part of the world. Forcing a subdued person to go barefoot is therefore used to showcase his or her deprivation of the most basic rights and natural liberties. It hereby displays the subjugation of the person under individuals with sufficient authority to impose and enforce certain living conditions. By abiding it also establishes that the person does not have the self-determination, means or power to resist. Forcing individuals to remain barefoot against their will is, therefore, a common method to display and exercise authority and showcase the flagrant disproportion of power usually found in situations of imprisonment. Exploiting the effects it is often used to intimidate captives or prisoners and cut their self-confidence. =Restraints= Presenting a prisoner to the public in restraints (such as handcuffs, shackles, chains or similar devices) has always served as a method of shaming the person as well. In addition to their practical use of preventing movement and escape, they are usually uncomfortable to wear and often lock the body in unnatural positions. Especially restraining the hands of a captive behind his or her back is perceived as particularly shameful, as it renders the person practically defenceless and showcases his or her physical defeat to onlookers. The effect is often multiplied by combining means of marking people such as the use of prison uniforms or similar clothing like penitential garbs and the exposure of bare feet. Other meanings The yellow badge that Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany as a badge of shame Nazi concentration camp badges of shame were triangular and color-coded to classify prisoners by reason for detention, and Jews wore two triangles in the shape of the six-pointed Star of David. These symbols, intended by the Nazis to be marks of shame, had opposite meanings after World War II: the triangle symbols were used on memorials to those killed in the concentration camps, the pink triangle that homosexual prisoners were required to wear became a symbol of gay pride, and the Zionists' Star of David, also co-opted for the Nazi version of the yellow badge, was subsequently featured prominently on the flag of Israel. Conversely, symbols intended to have positive connotations can have unintended consequences. After World War I, the U.S. War Department awarded gold chevrons to soldiers serving in the combat zones in Europe. The silver chevrons awarded for honorable domestic service in support of the war effort were instead considered a badge of shame by many recipients. In April 1945 the government of Czechoslovakia ordered the expropriation, denaturalisation and ensuing deportation of all Czechoslovaks of Magyar or German native language. In May 1945 Czechoslovaks of German native language had to wear white or yellow armbands with a capital N, for Nƒõmec (German), printed on. The armbands were to be worn on the outside clothes until finally, the government had deported all its citizens of German native language, by 1947. More recently, in 2007, the Bangkok, Thailand police switched to punitive pink armbands adorned with the cute Hello Kitty cartoon character when the tartan armbands that had been intended to be worn as a badge of shame for minor infractions were instead treated as collectibles by offending officers forced to wear them, creating a perverse incentive. The revised scheme, however, was also soon abandoned. Fictional works This lobby card for the 1934 adaptation of The Scarlet Letter prominently features the letter \\"A\\". In Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic 1850 romance novel The Scarlet Letter, set in 17th century Puritan Boston, the lead character Hester Prynne is led from the town prison with the scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her breast. The scarlet letter \\"A\\" represents the act of adultery that she had committed and it is to be a symbol of her sin for all to see. Originally intended as a badge of shame, it would later take on different meanings as her fictional life progressed in the story. The 1916 silent film The Yellow Passport, starring Clara Kimball Young, was also known as The Badge of Shame when it was reissued in 1917. In the 2006 film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is seen using as a fireplace poker, a branding iron with the letter \\"P\\" that he used to impart the \\"pirate's brand\\" seen on the right forearm of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). According to the backstory, Sparrow was branded a pirate by Beckett for refusing to transport slaves for the East India Trading Company. In the film Inglourious Basterds the protagonists carve swastikas into the foreheads of surviving German soldiers, to make their malfeasance known to all in the future.

Time reverse modeling of LF microtremors: Application to hydrocarbon reservoir localization. Geophysical Research Letters, 35, L03307. If the latter is planned, data are usually acquired in multiple (in the ideal case - all) points simultaneously, using so called synchronized lines. Reliability of the time reverse modelling can be further increased using results of reflection seismology about the distribution of the sound speed in the underground volume. Passive seismic usually focuses on a low frequency signals (0 to 10 Hz) and is sometimes called the \\"low frequency\\" seismology. The seismometers record movements in all 3 possible directions independently (such devices also have other application areas like long-term measurement stations). When needed, data acquisition is also done under water, using waterproof devices that measure earth movements at the bottom of the sea. Geophones are almost never used due to their limited sensitivity. The survey using this method is very different from the conventional survey that is usually based on reflection seismology. The conventional survey consists of numerous measurements that are spatially very close together and relatively short (often lasting in the order of minutes). The passive seismic survey has much less measurements but they are frequently recorded for days. Local time must be taken into consideration, picking intervals with less human induced noise. Even relatively distant earthquakes are visible in the recorded spectrograms and must also be excluded from analysis.Blue D, Meskauskas A (2009). Using low frequency seismic. Digital Energy Journal .

It is also cheaper and more environmentally friendly than active seismic, which requires a strong source of the seismic waves (like an underground explosion) to predict the structure. In some cases it may be the only method for which land access is granted by the land owner. Despite the method having been successfully applied in many parts of the world, this approach is currently less reliable, as the scientific methods are still largely under development.

Formation and early history Queens Park Rangers F.C. were formed in 1886, when a team known as St Jude's Institute (formed 1884) merged with Christchurch Rangers (formed 1882), although their official founding date is 1882 the same as when Christchurch were first formed. They were called Queens Park Rangers, because most of the players came from the Queens Park area of North-West London. QPR became a professional team in 1889. The club were elected into the Southern Football League in 1899. They first won the Southern Football League in 1907-08. As Southern League champions that year, the club played in the first ever Charity Shield match, against the Football League champions, Manchester United. They lost 0-4 in a replay after the first game had finished 1-1. Both games were played at Stamford Bridge. QPR were Southern League champions for a second time in 1911-12. The club joined the Football League in 1920, when the Third Division was formed, mainly with Southern League clubs. When the Third Division was split into North and South the following season, QPR, like most of the former Southern League clubs that had joined the Football League to form the Third Division, were in the Third Division (South). QPR played their home games in nearly 20 different stadia (a league record), before permanently settling in Loftus Road in 1917 (although the team briefly played at White City between 1931‚Äì32 and 1962‚Äì63 in the hope of attracting larger crowds).Inglis, Simon: Football Grounds of Britain, page 305-6. The club played on two grounds within Park Royal. The first was the Horse Ring, the site of the now-demolished Guinness Brewery, on the Royal Agricultural Society's show grounds from 1904 to 1907 which had a capacity of 40,000. When the Society sold the grounds in 1907, the club moved to the Park Royal Ground, 400 yards south, an almost exact replica of Ayresome Park, with a capacity of 60,000. They were forced to move out in February 1915 as the ground was taken over by the Army.Inglis, Simon: Football Grounds of Britain, page 304. Cup glory and promotion to the top flight The club were promoted as champions of Division 3 South in the 1947‚Äì48 season. Dave Mangnall was the manager as Rangers enjoyed four seasons in the Second division, being relegated in 1951‚Äì52. Tony Ingham was signed from Leeds United and went on to make most ever league appearances for QPR (519). Prior to the start of the 1959‚Äì60 season saw the arrival of arguably the club's greatest ever manager,Alec Stock Obituary at QueensParkRangersFC.com Alec Stock. The 1960‚Äì61 season saw QPR achieve their biggest win to date ‚Äì 9‚Äì2 vs Tranmere Rovers in a Division 3 match. In time, Stock, with the advent as Chairman in the mid-60s of Jim Gregory helped to achieve a total transformation of the club and its surroundings. In 1966‚Äì67, QPR won the Division Three championship and also became the first Third Division club to win the League Cup, when on Saturday, 4 March 1967, they defeated West Bromwich Albion 3‚Äì2, (coming back from a two- goal deficit). As of today, it is still the only major trophy that Rangers have won. It was also the first League Cup Final to be held at Wembley Stadium. The undoubted star of the team was Rodney Marsh who scored 44 goals, but also included Les Allen, Roger Morgan and captain Mike Keen. They won promotion again the following year, reaching the top flight for the first time in their history. Unfortunately, their debut in the top division rapidly turned into an absolute disaster, as Stock was harshly sacked over the summer after missing the final three months of the promotion campaign due to illness. His chief coach, Bill Dodgin, Jr. took over as manager, but after a bad start to the season stepped aside in favour of Tommy Docherty, who in turn resigned after only a month, claiming that he was unable to work with the club's board. Les Allen was appointed as player-manager after Docherty's departure, but was unable to improve matters and the club were relegated straight back to the Second Division. Promotion again After relegation in the 1968‚Äì69 season, QPR spent four years back in the Second Division. Terry Venables joined from Spurs at the beginning of the 1969‚Äì70 season. Later, Rodney Marsh was sold to Manchester City, but a skilful and exciting team was built largely by Gordon Jago. This included goalkeeper Phil Parkes, striker Don Givens from Luton, winger Dave Thomas from Burnley and Marsh's replacement, the outrageously skilled Stanley Bowles. These new signings in addition to home grown talent such as Dave Clement, Ian Gillard, Mick Leach and captain Gerry Francis finished runners up to Burnley in 1972‚Äì73 season. Sexton's supremes Jago resigned in late 1974 and was replaced by former Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. Sexton added John Hollins, Don Masson and David Webb to give the side the blend of experience that was needed. In 1975‚Äì76, Sexton led them to the runners-up spot in the First Division, missing out on the league title by a single point. After completing their 42-game season, QPR sat at the top of the First Division a point ahead of Liverpool who had to win their final game of the season, at Wolverhampton Wanderers to snatch title away from Rangers. Because of Liverpool appearing in the then two-legged UEFA Cup Final, the game was held over for ten days. Despite Wolves taking the lead and holding it until the 77th minute, Liverpool scored 3 times to win 3‚Äì1 and clinch the league title. The squad contained seven England internationals. Had the current 3-points-for-a-win and goal-difference rules been in place, QPR would have stood a chance as their points would have been equal, with a goal difference of only 1. In 1976‚Äì77, QPR failed to recreate their fine form of the previous season in the league, but the cup competitions saw some success. The side reached the semi-finals of the League Cup but lost in a replay to Aston Villa and in their first entry into European football reached the quarter finals of the UEFA Cup losing to AEK Athens FC on penalties. In the summer of 1977 Sexton moved to Manchester United and was replaced by his assistant, Frank Sibley, who became the youngest manager in the history of the Football League. The following season proved to be a poor one however, and QPR only just avoided relegation, leading to Sibley's tenure being cut short after just a year. Former manager Alec Stock agreed to return to the club over the summer, only to back out just days before the following season started, due to a disagreement over the playing budget, leading to the hasty appointment of Stock's intended assistant, Steve Burtenshaw as manager. 1978‚Äì79 proved to be a thoroughly dismal season, and the club were relegated after winning just six league games (four of the victories coming before Christmas 1978). Revival under Venables Tommy Docherty was appointed in 1979 but after little progress Terry Venables took over as manager in October 1980. In 1981, the club installed a 'plastic pitch'. The technology was premature and this unpopular measure was reversed in April 1988. The first game on plastic was against Luton Town who won the game 2‚Äì1 and later became the second side to install an artificial pitch. That same season QPR reached the FA Cup Final for the only time in the club's history, facing holders and London rivals Tottenham Hotspur. The first game ended 1‚Äì1 after extra time and so for the second year running the Final was to be decided by a replay. Tottenham won the replay 1‚Äì0 with the only goal coming from a Glenn Hoddle penalty in the 6th minute. There was disappointment in the league as they finished fifth in the Second Division after spending virtually all of the season in the top three until the final stages. The following season however, 1982‚Äì83 QPR went on to win the Second Division championship quite comfortably thus returning to English football's top division. The side included accomplished players such as Steve Wicks, Terry Fenwick, Simon Stainrod, Clive Allen and future manager John Gregory. After a respectable fifth-place finish, and UEFA Cup qualification, the following year, Venables departed to become manager of Spanish club Barcelona. Mixed fortunes Venables was replaced by Alan Mullery, who early in his brief reign presided over one of the worst defeats in QPR's history, a 0‚Äì4 loss against Partizan and elimination from the UEFA Cup despite a 6‚Äì2 1st leg advantage. Despite this loss the club's league form was generally decent, but Mullery was inexplicably sacked and replaced by former manager Frank Sibley in December 1984. The season rapidly deteriorated after this, and a bizarre run of form (in which the club alternated between winning and losing every match for nearly three months) combined with a dismal end to the season saw them only escape relegation due to Norwich City losing their last game. Jim Smith replaced Sibley that summer and oversaw a period of relative stability for the club, comfortably avoiding relegation in his first two seasons and also being runners up in the 1986 League Cup, losing to Oxford United. They finished in fifth place in the 1987‚Äì88 season, but missed out on a UEFA Cup campaign due to the ban on English clubs in European competition which arose from the Heysel Stadium disaster. Despite the club being well- placed in the table the following campaign, Smith surprisingly resigned to take over at the First Division's bottom club, Newcastle United. Following Smith's departure, Trevor Francis took over as player-manager and steered the club to another respectable finish, this time in ninth place. As the season drew to an end however, rumours of discontent between Francis and the senior players came to a head, and the effects rapidly became evident on the pitch as the club made a horrid start to the 1989‚Äì90 season, winning just 2 of their first 12 games and leading to the dismissal of Francis. He was replaced by Don Howe, and the club recovered well under the new manager, finishing in eleventh place, with only a poor end to the season preventing them from doing even better. However, they failed to improve significantly the following season, dropping one place to twelfth, which resulted in Howe's contract not being renewed at the end of the season. The return of Gerry Francis Gerry Francis, a key player in the 1970s QPR side who had proved himself as a successful manager with Bristol Rovers, was appointed manager in the summer of 1991. In the 1991‚Äì92 First Division campaign, they finished mid-table in the league and were founder members of the new Premier League which began in 1992. Francis oversaw one of QPR's most famous victories, the 4‚Äì1 win over leaders Manchester United at Old Trafford broadcast live on terrestrial television on New Year's Day 1992. The hat-trick scored by Dennis Bailey in that game remains the last time the feat was achieved in league football at Old Trafford. Many people also saw it as the beginning of the downturn in United's league form that season, as they suffered a severe shortage of goals in the second half of the campaign and were beaten by the league title by Leeds United.Hat-trick hero still going strong, BBC Sport, 3 February 2006 They finished that season in fifth place, and in the following season Francis guided them to a ninth-place finish. Midway through the 1994‚Äì95 season Francis resigned and very quickly became manager of Tottenham Hotspur and Ray Wilkins was installed as player-manager. Wilkins led QPR to an eighth-place finish in the Premiership and they also reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, sparking hopes that Wilkins could maintain the success that Francis had achieved. However, July 1995 saw the sale club's top goalscorer, Les Ferdinand, for ¬£6 million to Newcastle United. Life after the Premiership Wilkins failed to find a successful replacement for Ferdinand and this was a major factor in QPR's relegation at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season. Following relegation, QPR competed in Division 1 until 2001 under a succession of managers, including Stewart Houston and Ray Harford. Gerry Francis returned in 1998 and for a while stabilised the club. However, the 2000‚Äì01 season proved to be a disaster, the only bright spot being the emergence of future England international Peter Crouch in attack. Francis resigned in early 2001 to be replaced by former player Ian Holloway but it was too late as the club was relegated to England's third tier for the first time for more than thirty years. Holloway consolidated the team and revived its fortunes finishing eighth in 2001‚Äì02, fourth in the following season (losing in the play-off final to Cardiff City) and finally second in 2003‚Äì04 which resulted in the club's promotion back to Division 1. The positive signs initially carried through into the following season as Rangers achieved a mid-table finish (11th) in the 2004‚Äì05 campaign. However QPR struggled to build on the previous years' successes and on 6 February 2006 Holloway was suspended amidst rumours of his departure for Leicester City. He was replaced by a former player; the popular Gary Waddock. The 2005‚Äì06 season overall was difficult for Rangers both on and off the pitch as financial troubles and boardroom issues combined with a series of poor performances and defeats. However, until the sacking of Ian Holloway, they had been secure in mid-table, it was only a winless run from the end of February to the end of the season, saw Rangers drop to 21st position. Financial troubles and problems off the pitch For some 10 years from the mid-1990s until late 2007, QPR were embroiled in financial and boardroom controversy. The club floated on the Alternative Investments Market in 1996 at the instigation of Chris Wright, but in 2001 following the relegation from the Premiership and a number of seasons in the second tier, the club was obliged to enter administration. A proposal to merge with Wimbledon was raised, but proved controversial and was dropped.BBC News The club left administration burdened with a ¬£10m loan from a Panamanian- registered financier at heavy interest, and secured by a mortgage upon the club's stadium.The Independent The club's debts were rumoured to be close to ¬£20 million. Scandal involving the directors, shareholders and other interested parties emerged during the 2005‚Äì06 season, following allegations of blackmail and threats of violence against the club's then chairman Gianni Paladini, who was allegedly held at gunpoint during a match at Loftus Road by hired thugs at the instigation of rival directors.BBC News He was later reported to have received threats and was, for a time, wearing a bullet-proof vest.Sunday Mirror The Chairman also launched a strong attack against some critics who he claimed were seeking to destroy the club.QPR Press Release In an unrelated incident youth team footballer Kiyan Prince was murdered on 18 May 2006.The Independent QPR avoid relegation Gary Waddock brought in several new players in preparation for the 2006‚Äì07 season, including Jamaican international centre-back Damion Stewart from Bradford City and Cameroon midfielder Armel Tchakounte from Carshalton Athletic, Zesh Rehman from Fulham, Nick Ward from A-League team Perth Glory and latterly the team's top goalscorer for the season, Dexter Blackstock from Southampton for ¬£500,000. The team was knocked out of the League Cup by Port Vale of League One and from the FA Cup by Luton Town, and struggled in the League. As a result, in September 2006, Waddock was demoted to first-team coach, and later left the club. Another former QPR player, John Gregory, replaced him as manager. He reduced the playing staff with Ian Evatt, Scott Donnelly, Ugo Ukah, Matthew Rose, Matthew Hislop, Jonathan Munday and Egutu Oliseh all agreeing mutual termination of their contracts, while Kevin Gallen and Sean Thomas were loaned to other clubs, and he signed Finnish defender Sampsa Timoska and Adam Bolder of Derby County, and introduced the impressive Lee Camp also of Derby on loan. The team climbed to mid-table including a 1‚Äì0 defeat of the then league leaders, Cardiff City, at Ninian Park with promising young striker Ray Jones scoring in the 88th minute.Cardiff 0‚Äì1 QPR BBC Sport 17 November 2006 Despite initial results the club later reverted to previous form and dropped once again to the relegation zone. In an exciting end to the season however, QPR secured safety after a run of wins, including beating Cardiff City again, this time by a solitary goal from Dexter Blackstock.QPR 1‚Äì0 Cardiff ESPN Soccernet, 21 April 2007 The last game of the season was a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to promotion contenders Stoke City. Martin Rowlands scored Rangers' last goal of the season. Eight QPR players were booked, the most for them in 2007 and Sampsa Timoska was sent off. QPR finished 18th, a marginal improvement on the previous season and did their traditional end of season lap of honour. On 7 February 2007, a friendly 'goodwill' match against China's youth side was curtailed after it descended into a \\"kung-fu\\" brawl, in which one Chinese player suffered a broken jaw and was knocked out.BBC Sport Causing a diplomatic incident, QPR's assistant manager Richard Hill was suspended by the club,BBC Sport and later replaced by Warren Neill. 2007‚Äì08 season 2007‚Äì08 started on a tragic note for QPR with the death of player Ray Jones in a car crash at the age of 19. Following this low point in the club's history, Rangers also faced mounting financial pressure, and in the same month it was announced that the club had been bought by wealthy Formula One businessmen Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, Rangers competed in the Football League Championship. John Gregory's reign as manager came to an end in November 2007 after a string of poor results left QPR at the bottom of the Championship,Gregory sacked as manager of QPR from BBC Sport and he was replaced by Luigi De Canio. QPR's form improved as De Canio guided them to a secure 14th place in the final table, and a narrow defeat at the hands of their Premier League neighbours Chelsea in the FA Cup third round. Further investment also followed in early 2008 courtesy of steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal as the club looked to push for promotion to the Premier League within 4 years, on the back of greater financial stability. On 8 May, QPR announced that Luigi De Canio had left the club \\"by mutual consent\\" and that a further announcement regarding a new manager for the following season would be made in due course. 2008‚Äìpresent Ian Dowie was revealed as Luigi De Canio's replacement six days after the latter's departure on 14 May 2008. Tim Flowers was subsequently named Dowie's assistant for the upcoming 2008‚Äì09 season, reprising his former role with Dowie at Coventry City. However, on 24 October 2008 Dowie was sacked after just fifteen games in charge of the club. On 19 November 2008, QPR named former Portugal midfielder Paulo Sousa as their new first team coach. Sousa was sacked on 9 April 2009, after he allegedly divulged confidential information without authority, and player/coach Gareth Ainsworth was appointed as player/caretaker manager for a second time. Jim Magilton took over as manager in June 2009, but left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009 and they were replaced by Paul Hart and Mick Harford on the next day. But then a month and five games after becoming manager at QPR, Hart parted with the club on 14 January 2010; the reasons for his leaving the club were unstated. Neil Warnock was appointed manager on 1 March 2010 and he guided the club back to the Premier League at the end of 2010‚Äì11 season by winning the Championship title. However, a subsequent FA investigation involving QPR's acquisition of Alejandro Faurl√≠n threatened to deduct points from the side and initially put their promotion into jeopardy. An investigation concluded on 7 May 2011, revealed the club to be found to be at fault in two of the seven charges, and received a fine of ¬£875,000, but there were no points deducted by the FA, and QPR's promotion to the Premier League was secured. Tony Fernandes became the club's new chairman on 18 August 2011, after buying Bernie Ecclestone's 66% majority stake. In January 2012, Fernandes appointed Mark Hughes as team manager only 36 hours after the previous incumbent Neil Warnock was sacked. Hughes led the club to safety. On 23 November 2012, Hughes was sacked after a poor start to the 2012‚Äì13 season, Harry Redknapp was confirmed as the new manager the next day. On 28 April 2013, in a 0‚Äì0 draw against fellow relegation rivals Reading, the club were relegated from the Premier League down to the Championship after two seasons in the top flight. At the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season, QPR won the final against favourites Derby County on 24 May 2014, 1‚Äì0 with a goal scored by Bobby Zamora in the 90th minute to return to the Premier League. QPR had a poor start to their 2014‚Äì15 campaign in the Premier League and Harry Redknapp resigned in February after poor results and mutual frustration with the board. He was replaced by Chris Ramsey. The team finished the season in last place with only 30 points, and were relegated back to the Championship after just one season. After a poor start the following season, Ramsey was sacked in November 2015 and former manager Neil Warnock returned to the club. On 4 December 2015, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was appointed the club's new manager. Hasselbaink was sacked on 5 November 2016 after just 11 months. Then six days later the club reappointed old favourite Ian Holloway. Holloway left the club at the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, and just a week later, on 17 May 2018, former England manager Steve McClaren was appointed as manager.

From 1969 to 1984 the presenter was Dieter Thomas Heck. The last show was aired on 16 December 2000. History The music show was developed by Truck Branss and Dieter Thomas Heck and first broadcast on January 18, 1969. The original theme song was written in 1968 by James Last and remained a hallmark of the show until the last show of host Dieter Thomas Heck on December 15, 1984. The first host was Dieter Thomas Heck, who presented once a month on Saturday at half past seven. Various performers sang their current songs, predominantly Schlager. Whereas the first show was produced in the studio, subsequent events were live. The next host of the Hitparade was Viktor Worms in 1985, succeeded by Uwe H√ºbner in 1990. The last episode aired on 16 December 2000. Idea When the show was conceived by Dieter Thomas Heck, he established some innovations to the Schlager genre, which already had adapted a somewhat conservative reputation compared to the current musical trends of the time. Among those innovations was the rule that each singer had to present his or her song live (to music from half-playback). Earlier musical TV-shows had already switched to full-playback. Also, with the exception of the pilot, each episode was live, which also was unusual. Another innovation of Hitparade was the stage design. All earlier musical shows in German television had a somewhat theatre-like design which created a huge distance between singer and audience. Also, their stage design was quite opulent with heavy decorations and curtains. Singing at the Hitparade in contrast meant that the audience sat all around the singer while the stage design was a modern latticework of chrome and steel. The most important innovation introduced by Dieter Thomas Heck was that the audience members had the chance to assert influence in the choice of musical artists. The viewers could select their favorite acts by postcard, which were then allowed to return in the subsequent broadcast. One artist got the chance to come back on subsequent shows with one song, twice.

Hoffmann Zur Methodik der Atomzertr√ºmmerungsmessungen, Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik Volume 73, Numbers 9-10, 578-579 (1932). The author was identified as being at Halle in Saale (Halle University). The article was received on 6 December 1931.Catalogus Professorum Halensis: Pose . In 1929, Pose studied the nuclear reactions of aluminum nuclei bombarded with alpha particles. His experiments showed the existence of discrete energy levels in the nucleus. His pioneering work described for the first time the effect of resonance transformation in a nuclear process. On the basis of these works and his Habilitation, Pose was awarded a teaching contract for atomic physics in 1934. He continued to study these nuclear reactions in other light (low atomic number) nuclei through the 1930s. In 1939, he was awarded an unscheduled/adjunct (au√üerplanm√§√üige) professorship at Halle. During World War II, Pose was delegated to various organizations to carry on nuclear research and development activities. From 1940, he worked for the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft's Institut f√ºr Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) on the German nuclear energy project Uranverein. He worked with Werner Maurer on proof of spontaneous neutron emission of uranium and thorium. From 1942, he was at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, where Abraham Esau was President, and also held the title of Plenipotentiary (Bevollm√§chtiger) for Nuclear Physics - as such, he controlled German nuclear research. Some of the research was carried out at the Versuchsstelle (testing station) of the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) in Gottow; Kurt Diebner, was director of the facility. The testing station is where Pose and Ernst Rexer compared the effectiveness of neutron production in a paraffin-moderated reactor using uranium plates, rods, and cubes. Internal reports (See section below: Internal Reports.) on their activities were classified Top Secret and had limited distribution. The G-1 experiment performed at the HWA testing station had lattices of 6,800 uranium oxide cubes (about 25 tons) in the neutron moderator paraffin. Their work verified Karl Heinz H√∂cker's calculations that cubes were better than rods, and rods were better than plates. In June 1944, he went to the Physics Institute of the University of Leipzig to work on cyclotron development.Walker, 1993, 94-104.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 373 and Appendix F; see the appendix entries for Pose, Abraham Esau, and Kurt Diebner. =In Russia= Near the close of World War II, the Soviet Union sent special search teams into Germany to locate and deport German nuclear scientists or any others who could be of use to the Soviet atomic bomb project. The Russian Alsos teams were headed by NKVD Colonel General A. P. Zavenyagin and staffed with numerous scientists, from their only nuclear laboratory, attired in NKVD officer's uniforms. In the autumn of 1945, Pose was offered the opportunity to work in the Soviet Union, which he accepted. He arrived in the Soviet Union, with his family, in February 1946. He was to establish and head Laboratory V (also known by the code name Malojaroslavets-10, after the nearby town by the same name) in Obninsk. The scientific staff at Laboratory V was to be both Russian and German, the former being mostly political prisoners from the Gulag or exiles; this type of facility is known as a sharashka. (Laboratory B in Sungul' was also a sharashka and its personnel worked on the Soviet atomic bomb project. Notable Germans at Laboratory B were Hans-Joachim Born, Alexander Catsch, Nikolaus Riehl, and Karl Zimmer. Notable Russians from the Gulag were N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij and S. A. Voznesenskij.) Oleynikov, 2000, 14.Polunin, V. V. and V. A. Staroverov Personnel of Special Services in the Soviet Atomic Project 1945 - 1953 [In Russian] (FSB, 2004) . On 5 March 1946, in order to staff his laboratory, Pose and NKVD General Kravchenko, along with two other officers, went to Germany for six months to hire scientists. Additionally, Pose procured equipment from the companies AEG, Zeiss, Schott Jena, and Mansfeld, which were in the Soviet occupation zone. Pose planned 16 laboratories for his institute, which was to include a chemistry laboratory and eight laboratories. Three heads of laboratories, Czulius, Herrmann, and Rexer, were Pose's colleagues who worked with him at the German Army's testing station in Gottow, under the Uranverein project. (See below: Internal Reports.) Eight laboratories in the institute were: *Heinz Pose's laboratory for nuclear processes *Werner Czulius's laboratory for uranium reactors *Walter Herrmann's laboratory for special issues of nuclear disintegration *Westmayer's laboratory for systematic nuclear reactions *Professor Carl Friedrich Weiss's laboratory for the study of natural and artificial radioactivity *Schmidt's laboratory to study methodologies for nuclear measurement *Professor Ernst Rexer's laboratory for applied nuclear physics *Hans J√ºrgen von Oertzen's laboratory to study cyclotrons and high voltage Although many eminent German scientists went willingly to the Soviet Union, including Manfred von Ardenne, Heinz Barwich, Gustav Hertz, Nikolaus Riehl, Peter Adolf Thiessen, and Max Volmer, the Russians were not above intimidation and heavy-handed techniques. It must have been highly intimidating to be invited to work in the Soviet Union by a uniformed (NKVD) officer of a conquering military force, especially in the wake of the devastation and brutality of the Battle of Berlin, one of the bloodiest conflicts in the closing months of the war and history itself. On the other end of the spectrum, the heavy-handed techniques were clearly demonstrated on a large scale, such as in Operation Osoaviakhim in late 1946.Naimark, 205-214 and 220-228. Since Pose was on the staff of the German nuclear energy project Uranverein, he had intimate knowledge of scientists who would be useful as staff and laboratory heads in his facility in Obninsk. This included personnel such as Rexer, Herrmann, and Czulius, who worked with Pose at the German Army's testing station in Gottow, under the Uranverein project, and had co- authored a classified nuclear energy report (see below) with him. Czulius, long after the war, remembered how an armed guard invited him to meet with an important Russian general in Berlin. When he got to Berlin, Czulius was told that the general was in Moscow, and he was sent there. When he got to Moscow, Czulius was informed that the general was busy, so he should get to work immediately, which he did.Walker, 1993, 183. While in Germany on his recruiting trip, Pose wrote a letter to the Physics Nobel Laureate Werner Heisenberg inviting him to work in Russia. The letter lauded the working conditions in Russian and the available resources, as well as the favorable attitude of the Russians towards German scientists. A courier hand delivered the recruitment letter to Heisenberg; Heisenberg politely declined in a return letter to Pose.Walker, 1993, 184-185. The Pose letter to Heisenberg is dated 18 July 1946, which would place Pose in Germany on his recruitment trip, according to Oleynikov, 2000, 14. In 1947, Alexander Leipunski, scientific liaison of the Ninth Chief Directorate of the NKVD since 1946, was assigned to Laboratory V. He eventually became the scientific director of the Institute of Power and Power Engineering, which was founded on the basis of Laboratory V. The Reactor Section of the Scientific Council of the First Chief Directorate of the NKVD, in May, assigned Leipunski and Laboratory V the tasking to develop nuclear reactors with beryllium as a neutron moderator. Later, Laboratory V was charged with the development of a gas-cooled reactor using enriched uranium and beryllium as a moderator. Laboratory V was also assigned tasking for the studies of radiation biology and separation of radio isotopes, similar to the tasking given Nikolaus Riehl's Laboratory B in Sungul'. Other personnel in Pose's Laboratory V were Wolfgang Burkhardt, Dr. Baroni, Dr. Ernst Busse, Dr. Hans Keppel, Dr. Willi Haupt, Dr. Karl-Heinrich Riewe, Dr. Eng. Herbert Thieme (formerly with Nikolaus Riehl at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å, sometimes transliterated as \\"Elektrostal\\".), Dr. Hans Gerhard Kr√ºger (formerly with Gustav Hertz at Institute G), Dr. Helene K√ºlz, Dr. Hellmut Scheffers, and Dr. Renger.Oleynikov, 2000, Reference #123 on p. 29. In this reference, Oleynikov cites as his source: Ulrich Albrecht, Andreas Heinemann-Gr√ºder, and Arend Wellmann Die Spezialisten pp. 61 and 67. In 1952, most of the German scientists left Laboratory V for a facility in Sukhumi, where they remained in quarantine until returning to Germany in 1955. However, Pose remained at Laboratory V until 1955, when he then went to the Laboratory for Nuclear Problems, now the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, in Dubna. In 1957, while still at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Pose became a professor for special areas of nuclear physics at Technische Hochschule Dresden.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Pose.Maddrell, 2006, 199. =In East Germany= In 1959 Pose returned to Germany and settled in Dresden, East Germany. In addition to continuing his teaching at the Technische Hochschule, he became the first director of the Instituts f√ºr Allgemeine Kerntechnik (Institute for General Nuclear Technology), whose chair for Neutron Physics of Reactors he also took over. At the same time, he became Dean of the Faculty for Nuclear Technology, which was created in 1955. After closing the Faculty for Nuclear Technology in 1962, Pose transferred to the directorship of the Institut f√ºr experimentelle Kernphysik (Institute for Experimental Nuclear Physics) and the teaching chair of the same name at the Technische Hochschule. He held these positions until 1970. Declined defection At the close of World War II, Pose's brother, Werner, was a prisoner of war of the Russians. Pose arranged for Werner to be transferred to Obninsk and he employed Werner as a technician in Laboratory V. When released from the Soviet Union in 1953, Werner, returned to Germany. Since his family lived in West Germany, he was sent there. Werner passed through the Friedland Camp upon entering West Germany. There, the Scientific and Technical Intelligence Branch (STIB) of the Control Commission for Germany - British Element (CCG/BE), recognized his potential and took an interest in him. So did the \\"Org\\", the Gehlen Organization, which would later become the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND, West German Federal Intelligence Service). Werner was eventually used by the CIA to try to induce Pose to defect to the United States in 1958. Pose rebuffed the attempt.Maddrell, 2006, 199-200. The Org and STIB had an interest in a chemist in Obninsk who Werner knew. When the chemist was allowed to go to Germany in 1955, Werner introduced the chemist to representatives from the Org and STIB. Unfortunately for Werner, the chemist had been recruited by the Ministerium f√ºr Staatssicherheit (MfS, Ministry for State Security) of East Germany. This eventually resulted in Werner being arrested by the MfS when he tried to cross over into East Germany. Werner was tried in April 1959 and sentenced to six years in prison.

Dalmatius served in the second company of Guards under Theodosius the Great. He was married with a family. Experiencing a call to monastic life, he received instruction from Isaac of Dalmatia. Like most of the city's monks, he was an opponent of the Nestorian heresy, and he played an important role in the downfall of Nestorius. Following Cyril of Alexandria's instructions, Dalmatius led an army of monks to the palace of Theodosius II, and shouted abuse against him, because he had sided with the Nestorians and annulled the First Council of Ephesus.Edward Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 47 Because this was the first time Dalmatius had left his monastery in 48 years, the emperor was astonished to see the holy man abroad and granted his request to hear Cyril's case, which led ultimately to Cyril's vindication.Caner, 219-20.

School profile  GIBS is a bilingual (German- English) university preparatory charter school. At present the school comprises more than 800 students and 60 teaching staff. The rest of the team is made up of the language assistants, trainee teachers and other administrative staff. The language of instruction is English in the form of \\"flexible monolingualism\\". The first three months of Year 1 take the form of an intensive phase of language acquisition after which the students have reached a level of language competence which enables them to participate in lessons conducted in the target language. Following the intensive phase, linguistic back-up for other subjects is provided when required in the English class. In Year 7 History is taught in French. During the first five school years in particular, different subjects collaborate on broad projects that supplement language instruction. Between Year 6 and Year 8, the upper level course system ensures the interconnection and deepening of learning material, and also allows the students to dive deeper into their interests that they wish to pursue in their later professional life. Students from non-German speaking countries receive instruction in German as a foreign language. Their evaluation is in accordance to ¬ß 18/12 of the School Instruction Guidelines which allows students to select either German or English as their first language of instruction and be thereby assessed accordingly.https://web.archive.org/web/20090310183418/http://www.gibs.at/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task;=blogcategory&id;=8&Itemid;=47 The school has a reputation for academic excellence and a strong participation in national awards and organizations. Upon graduation, virtually 100% of students enroll in a 4-year degree program. GIBS graduates have attended Harvard College, Imperial College London, Cornell University, King's College London, London School of Economics, Oxford University, Maastricht University, ETH Z√ºrich and the University of St. Gallen, among others. The level of education is similar to the normal equivalent of the Austrian school system, but allows room for further study in the individual's field of interest through the upper school course system. Language proficiency in at least one foreign language is a graduation requirement, and three foreign languages (English, French, Spanish, Russian, Latin, or German as a Foreign Language) must be taken for 8 (English), 6 (French or Spanish) or 4 (Latin or Russian) years respectively.  Campus  The school campus is located in the North Western part of Graz in Eggenberg, neighbouring the historic palace Schloss Eggenberg and the private school of the Grazer Schulschwestern. The main building to which the school relocated in 2010 was built in 1964 after the designs of G√ºnther Domenig and Eilfried Huth. This building houses, among others, the biology lab, three computer science labs, the library, the gym and changing rooms, music and art rooms, practise rooms, the administration and conference rooms, and most classrooms. Furthermore, the Northern Wing offers after-school facilities and the cafeteria for those participating in ACE, additionally to the main office and storage rooms. Study corners can be found throughout the school. The underground parking garage is directly accessible from the main building. The new wing, built in 2010, is home to the classrooms of the graduating class, the chemistry and physics labs and the visual arts room.  Sport facilities  Additionally to the school gym, the neighbouring ASK√ñ sport centre and Auster Bad provide gyms, volleyball courts, tennis courts, basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, running tracks and indoor/outdoor swimming pools, which are used regularly by the students for school and extracurricular activities.  Admissions  GIBS is, in theory, a public state school but there are entrance limitations. These are largely a result of the number of applicants that apply because of the very prestigious reputation of the school. In the past few years, GIBS has been getting nearly four times as many applications from new students than it can accept. In order to be accepted to GIBS a student's elementary school report card must consist mainly of \\"Sehr Gut\\" or \\"A\\" grades (90% or over in all classes), and the student must complete an entrance test and interview together with other applying students. Students with a bilingual background will be given higher priority, and have to complete an individual interview.  Course system  The school offers a Course System for Years 6-8. While upholding the principle of an all-round education fundamental to the Austrian school system, the course system allows students more freedom to pursue their particular interests and in-depth study. Students can select courses which are useful for their proposed academic and professional careers.  Student, parent and teacher Involvement  The school encourages strong student and parent involvement, whether this be concerning outings or schoolwork. Alongside the class representatives (two per class, e.g. 4 or 6 per grade), which are elected for a yearly term and deal with issues directly in the student body, the SGA (Schulgemeinschaftsausschuss) is the main decision-making body of the school. It is composed of the principal or administrator as a chairperson (depending on availability and does not have a vote), three parent representatives, three staff representatives, and the three student-body presidents. All are elected at the beginning of the year by the respective groups. A majority vote of two votes per party is needed for any decision to be passed. Furthermore, the Parent-Teacher-Association is involved in many issues concerning the school from school funding to course decisions and social events. On a social level, the PTA and the student-body organize frequent social events during the year. The Graduation Ball that is organized by the graduating class is held in high regard throughout the city, often having more than 3,000 visitors. Other events include the annual Jazzbrunch, the Talent Show, the Graduation Awards Ceremony, the Halloween and Carnival Parties, the Christmas Performance and frequent Drama Club performances.

At a national level he has appeared in the England Sevens and England U21 teams. He also played rugby league for a time on loan with the London Broncos. Early life Chesney was born in Ilford, North East London on 2 March 1974 and educated at the Chadwell Heath Foundation School, now known as Chadwell Heath Academy. Chesney did not play rugby until he was 18 because only football, basketball and cricket were played at his school. It was a number of friends in his cricket club who also played rugby at Barking RFC who suggested that he give the game a try. Playing career =Barking RFC 1993-95= Chesney developed his skills playing for Barking RFC until, on the threshold of the professional era, he moved to Saracens in 1995, having rejected overtures from Harlequins and London Wasps. Despite his late introduction to the sport his progress was sufficiently rapid to merit inclusion in the England U21 side. =Saracens 1995‚Äì2009= Chesney formally joined Saracens on 1 July 1995, making his d√©but against Shannon RFC at the start of the 1995‚Äì96 Allied Dunbar Premiership season on 2 September of that year. Despite this early run out, first team appearances proved hard to come by and by 1998 spells on loan to Bristol Rugby and crossing codes to appear for the then London Broncos. Upon his return to Saracens first team starts came along more often and by the 1999‚Äì00 season he had become a regular with 19 appearances in the Allied Dunbar Premiership alone. After this break through Chesney rarely relinquished his position as a first choice selection other than through injury, such as the serious cruciate and medial knee ligament damage during the 2000-01 Zurich Premiership season. One of Chesney's key strengths has been the speed he can generate for his size, which was clearly an asset that was considered in his selection to play in the England Sevens team. He has been timed at 11.2 seconds over 100 metres, and demonstrated this speed in scoring a try against the Newcastle Falcons which brought him the award of Try of the Season for the 2004-05 Zurich Premiership season. Along with Richard Hill and Kevin Sorrell he formed part of a triumvirate that has been with the club through the entire professional era and still justified 33 appearances in the 2006-07 Guinness Premiership season. In the 2007-08 Guinness Premiership season Chesney passed the milestone of 300 appearances for Saracens in all competition and 150 appearances in the English Premiership. =Toulon 2009‚Äì= In 2009 Chesney decided to move to French club RC Toulon. On 24 March 2011 a move to Sale Sharks broke down due to Chesney's desire to stay and finish his career with Toulon. =Southend R.F.C. 2014‚Äì= In 2014 Chesney joined Southend RFC, where he is Captain of the 1st XV. Chesney has made an immediate impact, he is now Club Captain.

It is one of four species of oral spirochetes to be reliably cultured, the others being Treponema pectinovorum, Treponema socranskii and Treponema vincentii. T. denticola dwells in a complex and diverse microbial community within the oral cavity and is highly specialized to survive in this environment. T. denticola is associated with the incidence and severity of human periodontal disease. Treponema Denticola is one of three bacteria that form the Red Complex, the other two being Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. Together they form the major virulent pathogens that cause chronic periodontitis. Having elevated T. denticola levels in the mouth is considered one of the main etiological agents of periodontitis. T. denticola is related to the syphilis-causing obligate human pathogen, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum. It has also been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.  Genome  The first genome of T. denticola to be sequenced was strain 35405 which was initially isolated and designated as the type strain by Chan et al. The 2,843,201-bp genome sequence encodes 2,786Ùè¥≤ open reading frames (ORFs) as well a 6 rRNAs and 44 tRNAs. This is in stark contrast to the minimal genome of Treponema pallidum which encodes only 1,040 ORFs.  Cell structure  The native cellular architecture of the bacterial cell was revealed using cryo-electron tomography, a technique observing intact plunge-frozen cells. Tightly organized bundles of periplasmic flagella were observed in the periplasm, a characteristic of spirochetes. The presence of the periplasmic flagella is widely regarded as being responsible for the microorganism‚Äôs ability to rotate and flex, in addition to its translational movement. Spirochetes, including Treponema denticola , are therefore able to navigate through particularly viscous environments, unlike that of other prokaryotes. The tapering of the cell ends, conserved between cells, encompass a patella-shaped structure observed in the periplasm at the cell tip. This structure might be involved in the polar attachment of the cells. Cytoplasmic filaments, a bacterial intermediate-like filaments composed of the protein CfpA, are adjacent to the inner membrane and run parallel to the tightly organized flagellar filaments. Those cytoplasmic filaments are critical for pathogenicity, directly or indirectly as they are also involved in chromosome structure, segregation, or the cell division processes. The absence of either flagella or cytoplasmic filaments in deficient mutant increase the mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro uptake.  Adherence and Cytotoxicity  The main site for T. denticola habitation in the oral cavity is the gingival crevice. These spirochetes attach to proteins (including fibronectin and collagen) of local gingival fibroblasts, binding to their plasma membrane. A 53-kDa surface protein on T. denticola is responsible for transporting its components into the host cell, exhibiting a cytotoxic effect. Accumulation of T. denticola in this manner facilitates the disease-causing process, including membrane blebbing and red blood cell lysis.  Role in Disease  = Periodontal Disease = Periodontal disease is a type of gum disease caused by the accumulation of plaque on the teeth due to poor oral hygiene. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria which can harden into a substance called calculus, irritating the gums. Treponema denticola, a subgingival oral spirochete has been associated with many periodontal disease conditions such as: the early stage of periodontitis, acute pericoronitis (infection under the gum tissue covering a partially erupted tooth)3, as well as necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (severe inflammation of the gum more common in immunocompromised patients). It relates to lesions limited to gingival tissue. Clinical evidence and research shows that periodontal pockets contain large numbers of treponema denticola together with other proteolytic gram negative bacteria, playing an important role in the development of periodontal disease. The toxic products of these bacteria, especially treponema denticola may damage the surface lining periodontal cells making them more prone to damage as well as lysis. Treponema denticola attaches to fibroblasts and epithelial cells as well as to extracellular matrix components which are found in periodontal tissues and release its own bacterial contents. The bacterial components are: * Outer sheath associated peptidases * Chymotrypsin proteinases * Trypsin proteinases * Hemolytic activities * Hemagglutinating activities * outer-sheath protein with pore-forming properties A number of studies have observed an increase of T. denticola in patients with orthodontic appliances, particularly the fixed type. = Oral Cancer = Treponema Denticola is a potential etiological bacterial agent for oral cancer. It encourages oncogenesis (process in which healthy cells become cancer cells) and therefore the progression of oral cancer through chronic inflammation advancing invasiveness of the cancer cells. This results in the ceasing of cell apoptosis (inhibition of controlled cell death ‚Äì a safety mechanism within cells to stop more damage from occurring), resulting in rapid growth and multiplication of cancer cells. This suppresses the immune system stopping the body from recognising the cancerous cells and as a result more cancer-promoting substances are produced. The presence of T. Denticola along with other periodontal pathogens and bacterial diversity within the oral cavity are important factors contributing to cancerous cells (including precancerous gastric lesions). = Vascular Disease = Atherosclerotic vascular disease is chronic inflammatory disease of large arteries distinguished by invasion, proliferation and accumulation of cells from arterial smooth muscle cells, and the circulating blood in the intimal layer with deposition of connective tissue and lipids, if left to get worse atherosclerotic vascular disease can result in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease (including angina, heart attack, arrhythmias, heart failure, strokes) is the leading cause of death globally. Substantial evidence between inflammation from infectious agents and development of atherosclerosis ‚Äì periodontal pathogens prominent contenders due to chronic inflammation related with periodontal disease. Treponema Denticola bacteria can penetrate gingival tissues and circulate through blood vessels, with opportunity to invade the heart and cardiovascular epithelium in medium to large arteries ‚Äì including aorta, coronary and carotid arteries. = Pancreatic Cancer = It has been recognised that there is an association between oral and intestinal cancer related deaths and chronic periodontitis. This is based on the high amounts of tumor suppressor gene p53 mutations and k-ras arginine mutations found in patients with pancreatic cancer. Peptidylarginine deiminases from oral bacteria are thought to be responsible for these mutations. This means that there could be a causative link between oral bacteria, particularly the red complex, and pancreatic cancer.

It is an ether formed from the alcohol analog of arachidonic acid and glycerol. Its isolation from porcine brain and its structural elucidation and synthesis were described in 2001. Discovery Lum√≠r Hanu≈°, Saleh Abu-Lafi, Ester Fride, Aviva Breuer, Zvi Vogel, Deborah E. Shalev, Irina Kustanovich, and Raphael Mechoulam found the endogenous agonist of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) in 2000. The discovery was 100 gram of porcine brain, (approximately a single brain) was added to a mixture of 200 mL of chloroform and 200 mL of methanol and mixed in a laboratory blender for 2 minutes. 100 mL of Water was then added, and the mixing process continued for another minute. After this, the mixture was filtered. Two layers then formed and the layer of water-methanol was separated and evaporated when pressure was reduced. Synaptosomal membranes were prepared from 250g of the brains of Sabra male rats. A Hewlett Packard G 1800B GCD system that has a HP-5971 GC with electron ionization detector was used. Production The production of the endocannabinoid is enhanced in normal, but not in endothelium-denuded rat aorta on reacting with carbachol, a parasympathomimetic drug. It potently reduces blood pressure in rats and may represent an endothelium-derived hypotension factor. 2-Arachidonyl glyceryl ether's structure can be determined by mass spectrometry and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. It was confirmed by comparison with a synthetic sample of the endocannabinoid. It binds to the Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (Ki = 21.2 ¬± 0.5 nM), which causes sedation, hypothermia, intestinal immobility, and mild antinociception in mice. The endocannabinoid exhibits Ki values of 21.2 nM and >3 ŒºM at the Cannabinoid receptor type 1 and the peripheral cannabinoid receptors.\\"2-Arachidonyl Glycerol ether ¬∑ Noladin; 2-AG ether (CAS 222723-55-9)  Cayman Chemical\\". Cayman Chemical. Retrieved 2011-05-29. The presence of 2-AGE in body tissue is disputed. Although a research group from Teikyo University, Kanagawa, Japan could not detect it in the brains of mice, hamsters, guinea-pigs or pigs, two other research groups successfully detected it in animal tissues.  Pharmacology  2-AGE binds with a Ki of 21 nM to the CB1 receptor and 480 nM to the CB2 receptor. It shows agonistic behaviour on both receptors and is a partial agonist for the TRPV1 channel. After binding to CB2 receptors it inhibits adenylate cyclase and stimulates ERK-MAPK and regulates calcium transients. In comparison to 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, noladin is metabolically more stable resulting in a longer half-life. It lowers Intraocular pressure, increases the uptake of GABA in the globus pallidus of rats and is neuroprotective by binding to and activation of PPARŒ±.

The crossing transgressed one of the Late Roman Empire's most secure limites or boundaries and so it was a climactic moment in the decline of the Empire. It initiated a wave of destruction of Roman cities and the collapse of Roman civic order in northern Gaul. That, in turn, occasioned the rise of three usurpers in succession in the province of Britannia. Therefore, the crossing of the Rhine is a marker date in the Migration Period during which various Germanic tribes moved westward and southward from southern Scandinavia and northern Germania.  Ancient sources  Several written accounts document the crossing, supplemented by the time line of Prosper of Aquitaine, which gives a firm date of 31 December 406 in his year-by-year chronicle: \\"In the sixth consulship of Arcadius and Probus, Vandals and Alans came into the Gauls, having crossed the Rhine, on the day before the kalends of January.\\"Arcadio VI et Probo, Wandali et Halani Gallias trajecto Rheno ingressi II k. Ian; quoted by Kulikowski 2000:328. A letter by Jerome, written from Bethlehem and dated to the year 409, gives a long list of the barbarian tribes involved (Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alans, Gepids, Herules, Saxons, Burgundians, Alemanni and the armies of the Pannonians).Jerome, Epistle to Ageruchia 123.16: Quadus, Vandalus, Sarmata, Halani, Gipedes, Heruli, Saxones, Burgundiones, Alemanni et - o lugenda respublica! - hostes Pannonii. Some of them, like Quadi and Sarmatians, are drawn from history or literary tradition.Michael Kulikowski, \\"Barbarians in Gaul, Usurpers in Britain\\" Britannia 31 (2000:325‚Äì345) p. 326 calls it \\"a long and fanciful list\\" and \\"surely no more than a display of ethnographic virtuosity.\\" Jerome lists the cities now known as Mainz, Worms, Rheims, Amiens, Arras, Th√©rouanne, Tournai, Speyer and Strasbourg as having been pillaged. In his History of the Franks, the 6th-century historian Gregory of Tours embedded some short passages of a lost account by the 5th-century historian Renatus Profuturus Frigeridus of a war between the Vandals, Alans and Franks that took place in the neighbourhood of the Rhine around the time of the supposed crossing of the Rhine. This text, scholarly called the \\"Frigeridus fragment\\", may provide some clues about the circumstances preceding the crossing. Olympiodorus of Thebes, a generally reliable contemporary historian, wrote an account of the crossing, of which only fragments have survived in quotations by Sozomen, Zosimus and Photius. Orosius mentioned the crossing in passing.  Interpretation  = Motives = Reconstructed map of the migration of Danubian peoples across the Rhine around 406 The initial gathering of barbarians on the east bank of the Rhine has been interpreted as a banding of refugees from the HunsPeter Heather, in: English Historical Review 110 (1995) or the remnants of Radagaisus' defeated Goths,Drinkwater 1998 without direct evidence. Scholars such as Walter Goffart and Guy Halsall have argued instead that the barbarian groups crossed the Rhine not (so much) because they were fleeing away from the Huns, but seized the opportunity to plunder and settle in Gaul when the Roman garrisons on the Rhine frontier were weakened or withdrawn in order to protect Italy. Peter Heather (2009), on the other hand, argued that this hypothesis does not explain all the evidence, such as the fact that 'the vast majority of the invaders who emerged from the middle Danubian region between 405 and 408 had not been living there in the fourth century', and that the evidence for any Roman military withdrawal from the northwest at this time is weak; escaping 'the Hun-generated chaos and predation' was still a better explanation. = Vandal‚ÄìFrankish war = According to the Frigeridus fragment, there was a war between the Franks and the Vandals, in which the latter were losing.Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks. Book II. Chapter 9. MacDowall (2016) suggested this war may have consisted of several battles, wherein the Franks were trying to defend their own territory and/or the Roman frontier as foederati, while Vandals were trying to either obtain a similar foederati status as the Franks, Alemanni and Burgunds on the east bank, or trying to cross the Rhine. Frigeridus states that the Vandals lost around 20,000 warriors, including their king Godigisel, in these military engagements. When the Vandals' war situation was becoming desperate, the Alans (who he mistakenly labels Alamanni) came to the rescue of the Vandals, and the joint forces seem to have defeated the Franks in a decisive battle. Frigeridus does not mention a date nor a precise location for this battle; he only indicated that the Alan army 'turned away from the Rhine' in order to intervene in the Vandal‚ÄìFrankish war, so it must have taken place some distance away from the river. MacDowall estimated that this last battle 'probably took place some time in the summer or autumn of 406, and it allowed the Vandals and their allies to move into Frankish territory on the middle Rhine'. Despite this, and against comtemporary military logic of staying in the winter quarters to await more favourable weather for their next campaign, Prosper claimed the Vandals and Alans crossed the Rhine in the middle of the winter, which MacDowall argues would only make sense if they were starving and desperate, and the lands they had just conquered from the Franks were insufficient to provide them with enough food for everyone. = Location = Reconstruction of Roman Mainz, with the Pons Ingeniosa bridge crossing the Rhine Jerome mentions Mainz (Mogontiacum) first in his list of the cities devastated by the incursion, there was a Roman stone pillar bridge across the Rhine at Mainz called the Pons Ingeniosa at that time, and the Vandals may have been starving (given the fact that they crossed the Rhine in mid-winter) and therefore decided to raid Mainz in order to plunder its food supplies; this is why scholars such as MacDowall (2016) assume this to have been the location of the crossing of the Rhine. Worms (Vangionum) and Strasbourg (Argentoratum) are two other Roman cities on the Rhine reportedly sacked, so an initial traversal further to the south may seem equally plausible (if one is to assume that it was accompanied by plundering a city on the western bank, which isn't even necessary; these cities could have been pillaged any time between the 405/6 crossing and Jerome's 409 letter). On the other hand, the downstream river fortresses of Nijmegen (Noviomagus) and Cologne (Colonia) in the north were apparently left intact by the barbarians, as was Trier (Augusta Treverorum), situated just west of Mainz. As Jerome had lived in Trier until 370, it's very likely he would have reported it if the invaders had attacked his former hometown, but he makes no such mention. = Frozen Rhine? = A frozen Rhine, making the crossing easier, is not attested by any contemporary source, but was a plausible surmise made by 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon. Although many later writers have since mentioned a frozen Rhine as if it were a fact, for Gibbon himself it was merely a hypothesis ('in a season when the waters of the Rhine were most probably frozen') to help explain why the Vandals, Alans and Suebi were able to cross the Rhine into Gaul with such apparent ease. It is also possible that they used a Roman Rhine bridge, or that the migrating peoples simply used boats. = Unguarded Rhine? = It is not clear why the Irano‚ÄìGermanic bands crossing the Rhine apparently met no organised military resistance on the Roman side. A common hypothesis is that Roman general Stilicho may have depleted the garrisons on the Rhine border in 402 to face the Visigothic invasion of Alaric I in Italy. Goffart argued in favour of this hypothesis based on the writings of the poet Claudian (died c. 404), who knew Stilicho personally; the general supposedly entrusted the defence of the Rhine frontier to the Franks and Alamanni, who were Roman foederati, for the time being until the Goths had been driven out of Italy. Furthermore, he interpreted the Frigeridus fragment as showing the Franks being initially successful in preventing the Vandals from crossing the Rhine, but that they could no longer hold them back when the Alans joined the fray. However, Heather (2009) pointed out that the evidence for any Roman military withdrawal from the northwest at this time is weak.  Dating  A 2000 article by Michael Kulikowski,Michael Kulikowski, \\"Barbarians in Gaul, Usurpers in Britain\\" Britannia 31 (2000:325‚Äì345). finding that in traditional historiography \\"the sequence of events bristles with technical difficulties\\", bypassed modern historians' accounts, which he found to have depended upon Gibbon and one another, and reanalysed the literary sources. His conclusion was that a date for the mid-winter crossing of the Rhine of 31 December 405 offers a more coherent chronology of events in Belgica, Gaul and Britannia. However, Kulikowski's dating theory, which is a revival of arguments that were put forward by Norman H. Baynes, was forcefully challenged by Anthony Birley.Anthony Birley, Roman Government of Britain, Oxford 2005, p. 458. = Problems with Prosper's account = Kulikowski outlined how 406 came to be selected. The sixth consulship of Arcadius, with Probus as co-consul, corresponds to 406. Prosper noted the invasion of Italy by Radagaisus as the prime event of the previous year, as well as his death, which actually occurred in 406, and he correctly assigned to the next year (407) the usurpation of Constantine III. \\"The three entries are linked, and together they tell a kind of story\\", Kulikowski observed. \\"Prosper was writing a chronicle, and the genre abhorred blank years. Since his chosen genre demanded an entry for each of three years, Prosper simply portioned out his sequence of events, one event to the year. He does the same thing elsewhere in the chronicle\\".Kulikowski 2000:329 = Usurpation of Marcus = Kulikowski noted a contradiction between Prosper's date and the assertions made by a fragment of Olympiodorus of Thebes, Zosimus's New History (vi.3.1) and Orosius that the Rhine crossing and the presence of barbarians in Gaul provoked the usurpation of Marcus in Britannia: the latter occurred in the course of 406, thus preceded the 31 December 406 date, and therefore the Rhine crossing must have happened earlier. Kulikowski's proposed date of 31 December 405 places the acclamation of the first of the usurpers in Britannia, which was characterised as a fearful reaction to the barbarian presence in Gaul, after the crossing of the Rhine.Kulikowski 2000:325 = Stilicho's inaction = With the traditional date of 31 December 406 in mind, much has been made of the inaction of Stilicho, which is sometimes imputed to his strategy focussed on ambitions in Illyria. Kulikowski's date of 31 December 405 finds Stilicho fully occupied in Tuscia battling the forces of Radagaisus, who was not finally overcome (Battle of Faesulae (406)) and executed until August 406.Peter Heather, Goths and Romans, 1991, 199‚Äì213.  Aftermath  Reconstruction of the 407‚Äì9 sack of Gaul, based on Peter Heather (2005) According to bishop Hydatius of Aquae Flaviae, the barbarians crossed into Spain in September or October 409; little is known about the acts of the Vandals, Alans and Suevi in Gaul between the crossing of the Rhine and their invasion of Spain. Gregory of Tours only mentions that 'the Vandals left their own country and burst into the Gauls under king Gunderic. And when the Gauls had been thoroughly laid waste they made for the Spains. The Suebi, that is, [Alans], following them, seized Gallicia.' Based on Jerome's letter, Kulikowski argued that the Vandals, Alans and Suebi probably mostly stayed in northern Gaul until at least the spring of 409 (the earliest possible date of Jerome's letter), because almost all cities pillaged by the barbarians listed by Jerome were located in the north, and the southern city of Toulouse (Tolosa) had so far been able to repel the invaders, and they hadn't yet crossed into Spain.

Werth was born September 21, 1896, in Leipzig, Germany. He studied at the Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig in Leipzig beginning in 1913. He studied there for two years before being drafted into the German army. After his two years of service he returned to the Academy. His professor was influenced by C√©zanne, although the public wasn't yet aware of the new trend of cubism in art. At the Academy, Werth studied the new graphic techniques and tried them out as illustrations of literary works. After graduating, Werth began to illustrate books, the first being Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida which was well received.USM de Grummond Collection - KURT WERTH PAPERS Werth moved to Munich, Germany after graduating, to draw satirical cartoons for various Munich magazines. In 1928, he and his wife Margaret, a Jewish German, moved to Berlin, Germany so that she could become part of the City Theater. In Berlin, Werth continued to draw satirical cartoons for Berlin magazines. With Hitler's increasing power, the magazines folded, and Margaret Werth, who was Jewish, was not allowed to work. In the 1939 the Werths emigrated to the United States where Werth found employment illustrating a Sunday column in the New York Times magazine.Guide to the Kurt Werth Papers 1896-1983 Werth began drawing political cartoons for a wide number of U.S. magazines with a political bent once the U.S. became involved in World War II. After the war Werth began to illustrate children‚Äôs books. One of his first attempts was Rosalys Hall's The Merry Miller. This attempt led to many other offers for illustrating work. Werth became a United States citizen in 1947.http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/CLRC-1716.xml Werth states, \\"As a German I was certainly influenced by the tradition of exact and thorough training in drawing. This goes back to D√ºrer and even farther.\\" He attempts to illustrate children's books in a \\"modern style\\". \\"Books have to be illustrated in our times. They should show the style of our times. Not all of them do it.\\" Kurt Werth died in New York City on August 25, 1983.

It was first published in the USSR in 1965 and the first English edition, translated by Leonid Renen, was published by DAW books in 1976. The literal English translation of the original Russian title is \\"Predatory Things of Our Times\\". This is a line from Andrei Voznesensky's poem Beatnik's Monologue. Machine Riot (1961).–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –í–æ–∑–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π. –ú–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥ –±–∏—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞ This novel is a sequel of sorts to an earlier Strugatsky novel Space Apprentice (1962). At the end of Space Apprentice, flight engineer Ivan Zhilin gives up space travel for Earth ‚Äì where \\"the most important things are\\" ‚Äì to make the solar system a better place for the young people of the world. The Final Circle of Paradise takes place a little less than ten years after Space Apprentice, in a medium-sized seaside resort city somewhere in Europe. In the intervening time, he has been working for the security service of the World Council, an international governing body similar to but far more powerful than the United Nations. A few years before, Zhilin fought as part of an international brigade to put down a Fascist uprising in the same city where this story is set, reminiscent of the Soviet experience during the Second World War. This was supposedly one of the \\"final\\" wars before universal disarmament, where the last of the fascists were finally defeated. Like other Strugatsky novels, the setting is an internationalized future of advanced technology and world peace. There is no iron curtain, cold war, or arms race. Most of the world is permanently at peace, with the rest on the verge of being forcibly demilitarized. Plot summary Ivan Zhilin, posing as a writer working on a novel, visits a seaside resort city to investigate a series of mysterious deaths. Zhilin's role as an undercover agent becomes apparent to the reader only gradually and is not brought into the open until the final chapters of the novel. While being given a tour of the city, a tourism official tells Zhilin that he will get no work done, as he will be distracted by the \\"twelve circles of paradise\\" found in the city. These include the Fishers, which provide thrill seekers with situations of extreme and potentially fatal terror, the Shivers, which electronically induce pleasurable dreams to large crowds of people, and the Society of Patrons of Arts, who procure priceless works of art and ritualistically destroy them. The culture of this city has become utterly decadent, the product of an age of universal affluence. Zhilin refers to the present state of the world as \\"the age of the boob\\" where the highest priority is placed on orgiastic pleasure and staving off boredom, to the neglect of culture, education and scientific progress. The authors express the Marxist perspective in the scene of an argument between Zhilin and a third-world revolutionary: The ultimate expression of the decadence of Earth culture is the mysterious \\"slug\\", which is apparently responsible for the deaths that Zhilin is investigating. At first Zhilin believes it to be some sort of narcotic, distributed by gangsters with secret laboratories and trafficking networks. Zhilin progressively finds clues that lead him to Peck Xenai, his former classmate and the last surviving member of his international unit that fought the Fascists some years before. Peck, however, is physically ravaged by alcoholism and the use of \\"slug\\" and does not even recognize Zhilin when he finds him. Zhilin succeeds in getting a \\"slug\\" from Peck, in the form of a small silver electronic component. What Zhilin finds when he plugs the \\"slug\\" into his radio receiver and lies in the bathtub causes him to rethink the entire situation. \\"Slug\\" turns out to be a way of generating an artificial reality significantly more intense than normal reality, to the point where there is virtually no comparison between our reality and that of the \\"slug\\". People become addicted to it and spend increasing amounts of time unconscious in their bathtubs until it kills them by nervous exhaustion or brain hemorrhages. This is \\"the final circle of paradise\\". It also turns out that the \\"slug\\" is not the work of gangsters or a secret laboratory, but is a common electronic component being used in a novel way. If \\"slug\\" were to become widely known, Zhilin concludes, nothing would stop it from being used by millions the world over. Zhilin, himself struggling not to use it a second time, concludes that \\"slug\\" represents \\"the end of progress\\". He foresees humanity as a whole entering this illusory reality, which will eventually destroy mankind. At the end of Space Apprentice, Zhilin began to devote his life to making the solar system a better place for young people struggling to find purpose in the world. At the end of this story, he leaves his work with the World Council to fight \\"the last war ‚Äì the most bloodless and most difficult for its soldiers\\" (p. 170) ‚Äì that of making life worth living for the millions caught unprepared in an age of affluence, so that they will never need anything like \\"slug\\". However, even as Zhilin is saying this, at the end of the novel it is left ambiguous whether he thinks he will be able to resist using the \\"slug\\" again.

Background Maude was the only son of Cornwallis Maude, 3rd Viscount Hawarden, and his wife Jane (n√©e Bruce). Political career Maude succeeded his father in the viscountcy in 1856 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. However, in 1862 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer, and later served in the Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby, Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1866 to 1868, 1874 to 1880 and 1885 to 1886. The latter year he was created Earl de Montalt, of Dundrum in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Between 1885 and 1905 he also held the honorary post of Lord-Lieutenant of County Tipperary. Family Lord de Montalt married Clementina, eldest daughter of Admiral Charles Elphinstone Fleeming, in 1845. She died in 1865. One of their sons, the Honourable Cornwallis Maude, a Captain in the Grenadier Guards, was killed in action at the Battle of Majuba Hill in 1881. Lord de Montalt died on 9 January 1905, aged 87, at a hotel at Holyhead, Anglesey. While waiting for a boat to Ireland he became too ill to travel and died.

She was scuttled on 5 May 1942 at Corregidor to avoid capture. Nevertheless, she was raised by the Japanese and designated as Patrol Boat No. 107. She was sunk by American planes on 5 November 1944. Operational history Monocacy was built in 1905 by the Maryland Steel Co. of Sparrow's Point, Maryland. She was acquired by the Navy on 27 July 1917 from the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Co., in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and placed in service at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 25 September 1917, designated SP-1116. She was commissioned 10 November 1917 as USS Genesee (Fleet Tug No. 55) with Lt. C. H. T. B. Tissell, USNRF, in command. Genesee sailed from Philadelphia 20 November 1917 and, after joining a convoy at New London, reached Queenstown, Ireland, 27 January 1918. Until the end of World War I she operated in the Bremerhaven-Queenstown areas patrolling, towing, and serving as standby for deep sea rescue work. After towing from Queenstown to Brest, Genesee arrived Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 31 December 1918 and served as a tug at that port until 1 April 1919 when she sailed for Brest. She provided tug services and aid to stricken ships and finally got underway 30 September for a 7-month tour of duty off Spalato, Dalmatia, and in Castella Bay. On 17 July 1920 Genesee was designated AT-55. Next assigned to the Far East, Genesee arrived Cavite, Luzon, 7 September 1920 for permanent duty on the Asiatic Station. She spent the summer of 1921 with the fleet at Chefoo, China, and returned to Cavite 19 September. Subsequently she operated as a tug, a ferry, and a target tow in the Philippines until she was scuttled at Corregidor 5 May 1942 to avoid capture. Subsequently raised by the Japanese, she was designated Patrol Boat No. 107. On 5 November 1944, American F6F Hellcats from Task Group 38.3 sank Patrol Boat No. 107 off Lubang Island ().

The station was established in 1962 as \\"WGMM\\", originally licensed only for limited daytime-only operation. Upgraded to 24-hours operation in 1984, the station has broadcast a variety of formats over the past 50 years, including country and Gospel music. WRLM is currently owned by F.W. Robbert Broadcasting and the broadcast license is held by CPT & T Radio Station, Inc. WLRM broadcasts a Blues and Southern Soul format Monday through Saturday, and Gospel music on Sundays. It features \\"Talk To Me\\" with Greg Peters during midday, and the syndicated Michael Baisden Show, weekday afternoons. Former morning drive personality, Spanky Brown, whose real name was Byron Yedell, died May 11, 2018 in Virginia. There has been no regular morning drive programming at WLRM since Browns death. History =1960s= This station began licensed broadcast operations on June 22, 1962, as \\"WGMM\\". Restricted to operating as a daytime-only radio station and broadcasting at 1380 kilohertz with 500 watts of power, WGMM was originally owned and operated by Radio Millington, Inc. Al McClain served as general manager, commercial manager, and program director with Web Anderson as promotions manager, Bob Trantham as news director, Emmett Kozel as chief engineer, and Mary Nell Thomas as traffic manager. By 1965, Bill Thomas was brought in to be the program director and Emmett Kozel added news director duties to his engineering role. A shift in personnel in 1965 saw Joe C. Matthews take over as president and general manager with Bill Thomas elevated to station manager. Lee Cash was named as program director and Ed Freeman became WGMM's chief engineer. The station also added five hours of \\"specialty\\" programming featuring country & western music. By 1968, the station was playing a 100% country & western format. At the same time, Chad Lassiter took over the general manager role and R.L. Merry became the program director. As the decade came to a close, William M. Brown became WGMM's general manager, program director, and news director with Sidney Williams as chief engineer. =1970s= Shelby Broadcasting Company, owned by Gary Acker, acquired the station in May 1969 and had the station's call sign changed to \\"WTNN\\". With Gary Acker as president of the company, Franklin Davis was named general manager, commercial manager, and promotions manager. Rick Stafford was hired as news director and Sidney Williams stayed on as chief engineer. By 1973, Charlie C. Freeman became both program director and promotions manager with Terry Rutherford taking over as chief engineer. The station maintained its country format. On August 27, 1973, the broadcast license for WTNN was transferred to The Moore Company with Gary Acker remaining as company president. This shift marked a format flip to Gospel music with Steve L. Williams becoming general manager, commercial manager, promotions manager, and news director for the station. Rick Smith was named program director and Dave Church became the chief engineer. This lineup of key personnel and the Gospel format remained steady through the end of the 1970s. =1980s= In March 1982, the station then licensed as \\"WTNN\\" was sold by The Moore Company, Inc., to L&M; Media, Inc. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accepted the filing on April 2, 1982, and approved the deal on June 2, 1982. Charles Trub served in dual roles as president and general manager with Penny Peck as operations director and Dave Church stayed on as chief engineer. The format was flipped back to country music. In November 1982, the new owners applied for a construction permit to shift from daytimer to 24-hour operation with 2,500 watts of signal power during the day and 1,000 watts at night from a modified antenna system. The Commission granted the permit on June 21, 1983. Along with this, they requested a new call sign for the station and were assigned \\"WMPS\\" on July 18, 1983 and Doug Foster Jr was named Operations Director. After nearly four months of testing, WMPS began licensed 24-hour operations on February 29, 1984. L&M; Media, Inc., applied to the FCC to transfer WMPS to the U.S. Radio Corporation in November 1986. The Commission approved the deal on December 19, 1986, and the transaction was formally consummated on January 21, 1987. WMPS was flipped to a talk radio format. Facing financial difficulties, the WMPS license was involuntarily transferred from U.S. Radio Corporation to trustee Von A. Harshman in September 1988. The FCC was informed on September 27, 1988, and the Commission approved the transfer on October 3, 1988. In August 1989, trustee Harshman applied to transfer the station to Good News Broadcasting Company, a religious outfit. The FCC approved the sale on October 31, 1989, and the deal was formally consummated on January 25, 1990. =1990s= This ownership proved short-lived as Good News Broadcasting Company filed an application in August 1990 to transfer WMPS to David Grayson Life Changing Ministries, Inc., for a reported sale price of $295,000. The FCC approved the deal on October 9, 1990, and the transaction was formally consummated on October 25, 1990. The new owners shifted the format to Contemporary Christian music. David Grayson Life Changing Ministries tried to transfer the license to Abundant Grace Fellowship, Inc., in January 1993 but the deal collapsed and was formally ended in April 1993. Another attempt to sell WMPS, this time to World Overcomers Outreach Ministries Church, Inc., was filed in January 1998. The reported sale price was $275,000 in cash. The FCC approved the sale on March 3, 1998, and the transaction was formally consummated on March 23, 1998. The new owners had the FCC change the station's call sign to \\"WOOM\\" on April 6, 1998, to reflect its ownership. WOOM broadcast a Christian music format. Later, another application was filed and the station was assigned the \\"WLRM\\" call sign by the FCC on October 25, 2002. As WLRM, the station aired a blend of religious and secular music as an outreach effort to \\"unchurched\\" residents of the Memphis area. =WLRM today= In September 2004, World Overcomers Outreach Ministries Church, Inc., (Alton R.

It is the ancestral seat of the Cooper family, partially moated by the River Unshin. Today it is a small family-run hotel. In the 1830s the Observatory on the grounds of the Castle had the largest refracting telescope in the world, and what today is known as the asteroid 9 Metis was discovered there in the 1840s by the Coopers' observatory staff. History =17th century= Sketch from 1860 In 1663 Cornet Edward Cooper, who served under Cromwell when his army defeated the O'Brien Clan, was allotted the original 14th-century Markree Castle and the surrounding lands. Until then, Markree had been a fortified outpost of the Irish McDonagh Clan, guarding the ford across the river Unsin. Conor O'Brien died in this battle, and Edward married his widow Marie Rua (Red Mary). With her two sons they went to live at Dromoland Castle. One son, Donough, was left Dromoland and the other inherited Markree. Charles Cooper, the last of the Cooper family to own Markree Castle, is a direct descendant of this son. Times remained turbulent and during an attempt by the English King James to regain the throne, the Catholic army occupied Markree Castle and the Coopers had to flee. After the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, they returned and have been resident ever since except for a brief period during the Civil War in the 1920s when Markree was again occupied, this time by the Irish Free State army. =19th century= The entrance gate In 1830, Col. Edward Joshua Cooper MP (1798‚Äì1863) eldest son of Edward Synge Cooper MP, and Ann, daughter of Henry Vansittart, Governor of Bengal set up Markree Observatory in the castle grounds. For a number of years Cooper's telescope was the largest in the world. \\"The Observatory of Mr Cooper of Markree Castle ‚Äì undoubtedly the most richly furnished private observatory known ‚Äì is worked with great activity by Mr Cooper himself and by his very able assistant, Mr Andrew Graham.\\" (Royal Astronomical Society, 1851)Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, volume 11, page 104 ‚Äì 105, 1851 The observatory remained active until the death of Edward Henry Cooper MP in 1902. According to some sources The Cyber Hymnal Cecil F. Alexander wrote her famous hymn, All Things Bright and Beautiful, while a guest there in 1848. The castle, as we see it today, dates from 1802 with exterior changes by the architect Francis Johnston and with some changes made, mainly to the interior, in 1896. The garden =Weather record= Ireland's lowest officially recognised air temperature, , was measured at Markree Castle on 16 January 1881.MET √âIREANN =20th century = The soldier and politician Bryan Cooper inherited the castle on the death of his father in 1902 and resided there with his family (except during World War I and when carrying out political duties) from 1903 until his death in 1930. After the Second World War the castle fell on hard times and stood empty and derelict for many years. In 1988 it appeared on the front cover of The Vanishing Country Houses of Ireland, a testament to the sad state of decay of many of Ireland's great houses at the time until, in 1989, Charles Cooper transformed his ancestral castle into a hotel. The castle's restoration was featured in a television documentary, and the renewed facilities featured a hotel and restaurant. The castle today The Cooper family tree In recent times, Markree Castle has operated as a hotel, run by Charles and Mary Cooper, the 10th generation of the family to live there. In 2015, after four centuries, it finally changed hands and is now run by the Corscadden family who also own Cabra Castle Hotel in Co. Cavan, Ballyseede Castle Hotel in Co. Kerry and Bellingham Castle in Co. Louth. The estate holds an array of wild life including red squirrels, otters, and kingfishers. The entrance contains a monumental staircase, which leads to a wonderful hall, from where a second staircase in carved wood leads to the 30 guest rooms. On the landing, a huge stained glass window traces the Cooper family tree from Victorian times back to the time of King John. The dining room is decorated in Louis Philippe-style plasterwork.

History The firm was founded in 1901 by business lawyers Thomas Harper Cobbs and John E. Bishop. The name changed to Cobbs, Logan, Armstrong, Teasdale & Roos in 1949. The firm's expansion includes three mergers, one with the St. Louis-based Schlafly, Griesedieck, Toft & Virtel in 1986, another with Kansas City-based firm of Dietrich, Davis, Dicus, Rowlands, Schmitt & Gorman in 1989 and the third with Kansas City-based Martin Leigh in 2020. Armstrong Teasdale established a presence in China in 1994 and was awarded a license to open a foreign law office in Shanghai in 2000 by the PRC Ministry of Justice. Armstrong Teasdale is also a member of the China Alliance, an arrangement with three leading independent law firms with practices in China's business and regulatory centers. The firm's subsidiaries are Environmental, LLC, which helps clients reduce environmental risks; Development Dynamics(D2), which provides an array of economic development advisory services; and Lawgical Choice, which uses advanced technology to organize and present relevant case information in a targeted, trial-ready format.

A federal jury in Texas delivered its verdict in favor of Ralcorp and Medallion subsidiary on all 12 counts including allegations of trade secret misappropriation. In a controversial David and Goliath battle, the firm represented St. Stanislaus Church in its property fight against the Archdiocese of St. Louis. The trial court ruled in 2012 that St. Stanislaus owned its property and had the right to pass bylaws that limit the authority of the Archdiocese over the church. Armstrong Teasdale client Morpho Detection, Inc. won a patent infringement case against Smiths Detection, Inc. over a screening system used to detect explosives and narcotics at many airports throughout the world. In a unanimous verdict, a Virginia federal jury decided in 2012 that Smiths infringed Morpho's patent for the widely used system. The U.S. Department of Justice in 2010 ended a lengthy investigation of Armstrong Teasdale client Alphonso Jackson, who served as Housing and Urban Development Secretary during the Bush Administration. The government ended the probe without bringing charges. In a 2010 ruling that affected stock option backdating cases across the country, a federal judge dismissed Securities and Exchange Commission allegations against Armstrong Teasdale client Michael F. Shanahan Jr., a former director of Engineered Support Systems and the son of its co-founder and former CEO.

Her influences include 1950s crooner music, 1960s psychedelia, soul music, and the Brill Building style of writing. Atkins has been compared to Roy Orbison and singers from the Brill Building era. Early life Atkins was born in Neptune, New Jersey. She grew up in Shark River Hills, a middle class enclave within Neptune overlooking the Shark River.\\"Nicole Atkins & the Sea Perform 'War Torn,' Chat 'Neptune City'\\", SPIN.com, January 22, 2008, Accessed January 29, 2008 \\"But the neighborhood I live in is called Shark River ‚Äì it's part of Neptune ‚Äì I live right across the street from the river, and there's a bird sanctuary.\\" Atkins has cited the bay as a major inspiration for her music, particularly the imagery of \\"the river in the rain\\" found in the title track on her album Neptune City. She started playing piano at nine years old and taught herself to play guitar at 13. She eschewed more popular acts of the day for musical groups her parents listened to, such as The Ronettes, Johnny Cash, and The Beach Boys. She has cited the vocalists Harriet Wheeler of The Sundays and Cass Elliot as important early influences. She started playing in pick-up bands and doing gigs at local coffeehouses while attending St. Rose High School in the nearby town of Belmar.

Among other bands, she joined a supergroup in the city called Nitehawk that, at one point, had almost 30 members. After she returned, she joined the band Los Parasols, releasing an EP with them entitled The Summer of Love in 2002. That same year, Atkins moved to the neighborhood of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, New York. Influenced by the artists signed to independent label Rainbow Quartz, she strayed from the louder rock music she'd played in North Carolina and moved toward the songcraft style of Wilco and Roy Orbison.\\"Nicole Atkins: The MusicSnobbery.com Interview\\" , MusicSnobbery.com September 29, 2005, Accessed January 21, 2008 She returned to Charlotte and played with several bands, most notably a group called Virginia Reel.

They specialised in recreating the complex vocal harmonies of international acts such as The Beach Boys and The 5th Dimension. They had nine top 20 hit singles in Ireland, including a reworking of The Rivingtons' song \\"Papa Oom Mow Mow\\", featuring the deep voice of lead singer, Derek Dean. Formation The Freshmen were formed in 1962 in Larne, Co. Antrim in Northern Ireland. The initial line-up changed over the nearly two decades of the band's existence as members came and went. Apart from Derek Dean, members included keyboard player, saxophonist, and singer, Billy Brown, who also arranged their trademark vocal harmonies, Damien McElroy (guitar), Torry McGahey (bass), Maurice Henry (saxophone), Sean Mahon (trumpet/trombone), and David McKnight (drums). The Freshmen supported The Beach Boys on their 1967 Irish tour. At the Belfast gig was a young Rory Gallagher, who later recalled (in conversation with journalist, John Waters) the impression both acts made on him: > The Freshmen, led by Billy Brown and Derek Dean, played first and featured a > medley of Beach Boys songs. They were astonishing, Gallagher recalled, > singing multiple harmony parts in perfect pitch. When the Beach Boys came on > later and sang the same songs, they sounded, by comparison, well . . . > rubbish.The Irish Times, \\"King Billy\\", 12 June 1999 Later years As they matured, The Freshmen moved away from covers and began to record original songs, some written by the band members. In 1970, they undertook their most ambitious project with the release of the six-track concept album, Peace on Earth. The record featured new material from well- known songwriters such as Jimmy Webb, with linking narration by Irish actor, Miche√°l MacLiamm√≥ir. On November 11 1970, at the RDS in Dublin, the Freshmen performed the entire album live with the RT√â Light Orchestra conducted by Don Gould.

It stars Daniel Stern, Arye Gross, and Patrick Dempsey as three very different brothers asked by their father to drive a 1954 Cadillac Series 62 convertible from Detroit to Miami. Plot Meet the Libner brothers: Marvin (Daniel Stern), the oldest, is a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. Buddy (Arye Gross), the middle child, is a timid dreamer. Bobby (Patrick Dempsey), the youngest, is a handsome rebel in reform school. As kids, they fought a lot and as adults, they barely speak to each other. In the summer of 1963, their tough and eccentric father, Fred (Alan Arkin), gives them a task: to bring a 1954 Cadillac, bought for their mother, Betty (Rita Taggart), from Detroit to Miami. As the trip goes on, the three brothers fight and begin to reconnect with each other while trying to keep the Caddy in mint condition.

Cadillac used the Coupe De Ville model name for a two-door hardtop from 1949 to 1993, not a convertible. The Cadillac in the film was actually a Series 62 Convertible. A portion of the film was shot in Cape Coral, FL. When set director Richard Villalobos needed props for the Florida segments, he connected with the CEO of Goodwill Industries of Southwest Florida to acquire props for the film, purchasing $4,000 worth of gently-used items from the local Goodwill store.Goodwill Goodies (March 1989).

MurnauBFI History The name derives from a theater, the Kammerspiele, opened in 1906 by a major stage director Max Reinhardt to stage intimate dramas for small audiences. Few Kammerspiel films were made, but nearly all are classics.Bordwell, David, and Kristin Thompson , ed. Film History. 3rd. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010. 95. Print. Kammerspielfilme (the plural form) formed a German film movement of the 1920s silent film period that was developed around the same time as the more commonly known Expressionist movement in cinema. The Kammerspielfilm was known as the \\"chamber drama\\" as a result of the influence from the theatrical form of the chamber play.The Wrong House: The Architecture of Alfred Hitchcock - Steven Jacobs - Google Books (pgs.16-17) It is characterised by its focus on character psychology and its lack of intricate set design.

This sound is one of the longest portions of inshore waterways in Newfoundland, located on its north-eastern coast in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Bonavista Peninsula is to the north of the sound, while Random Island is to the south. The waters that make up the sound is a continuous channel that encircles Random Island, broken only by a narrow channel located at Clarenville where a causeway was built to provide access to the communities on Random Island. The channel on the south side of Random Island is North West Arm. Early history The area was visited seasonally by fishermen in the 18th century, and first settled in the 19th century. On September 5, 1822, William Cormack sailed through Smith Sound to explore the region with Sylvester Joe, a Mi'kmaq guide. Cormack's account of his travels were published in 1824 and republished in 1856. Permanent residents settled in during the 1850s through 1870s. In addition to the fishery industry, others were involved in sawmilling and slate quarrying. Towns abounded on both shores. Some changed or merged over the years, but a partial list includes White Rock and Burnt Brook (or \\"Brickyard\\"), the site of an 1850s brick plant at the head of Smith Sound, along with British Harbour, also at the head of Smith Sound, but now an abandoned community, as is Popes (or Pope's) Harbour. Other communities included Britannia, Lower Lance Cove, and Petly (now Petley), Random Island's second largest community, a merger of two original communities of Upper Lance Cove and Aspen cove). George's Brook was settled early on, around 1862, after John Pelley started a saw mill. King's Cove was renamed Milton in 1910. Sandy Point became Harcourt, White rock Gin Cove, Upper Rocky Brook became Monroe. Daniel's Cove became Waterville. Burgum's Cove was renamed Burgoyne's Cove in honour of a British general, John Burgoyne, who spent time in the area in the late 18th century. Present day =1953 Nut Cove tragedy= On the north shore of Smith Sound, across from Britannia, lies Nut Cove, the site of a slate quarry run by three brothers, William Carberry, George Carberry and Jubal Carberry, during 1850-1900. Approximately 100 years later, it became better known as the inclement-weather crash site of an American Convair B-36 bomber known as The Peacemaker, killing all on board on March 18, 1953, including Brigadier General Richard E. Ellsworth. The flight originated in the Azores and was bound for the plane's home in Rapid City Air Force Base, South Dakota, renamed Ellsworth Air Force Base. The calamity claimed more lives that night when all on board a second plane, a Boeing SB-29 Superfortress from Harmon Air Force Base in Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador spotted the downed Convair, then disappeared, the plane and crew never seen again. =Industry= In addition to its jellyfish harvesting industry, Smith Sound is known for its large Atlantic cod population. Fourteen-year-old cod are not unusual here. =2003 frozen cod mystery= In April 2003, thousands of dead cod, a weight of approximately a quarter-million pounds, washed up on the shores of the sound within a few days, called an ecological disaster, prompting scientific research into the cause. After an interview with DFO scientist John Brattey, CBC St. John‚Äôs news website posted: > Brattey says the water remains the coldest that the department has ever > recorded in the area, and some fish will continue to die. He says tests show > some of the cod have an anti-freeze protein, while others don't. Otherwise, > the dead cod appears to have been healthy up until it was instantly frozen > by contact with ice crystals. Brattey says the organs of the dead cod are > frozen solid, even though the flesh of the fish is pliable. =Tourism= * Route 232, Smith Sound Road - located on the Bonavista Peninsula, north side of the sound. * The scenic Smith Sound Trail - located at Brittania.

From his arrival in the USA in 1957, he was largely responsible for the spreading of commedia dell'arte in North America. He first gained attention in Italy in 1947 alongside Marcel Marceau in the mime‚Äôs first tour outside of Paris.Giants of Commedia: Carlo Mazzone-Clementi, 4 February 2011, retrieved 8 February 2013. From 1948 to 1951, he assisted Jacques Lecoq, while Lecoq taught and directed the Players of Padua University. In 1954, Mazzone-Clementi was at Piccolo Teatro di Milano with Dario Fo and Franca Rame. While he was performing with Piccolo Teatro as well as teaching in Rome, the American theatre scholar and director Eric Bentley came to Italy to direct the Padua Players company in the first Italian production of Bertolt Brecht. Then, with Bentley‚Äôs patronage, Mazzone-Clementi toured the United States in 1958, conducting workshops in mime and commedia, and introducing the leather masks of Amleto Sartori to this country. That led to a teaching assignment at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, followed by Brandeis University, the University of California at Berkeley, the American Conservatory Theater and others.Steven Winn, Carlo Mazzone-Clementi, 14 November 2000 He was known as Carlo Mazzone until 1965 when he worked with the new acting ensemble at the Theatre of Lincoln Center. From then on he was known as Carlo Mazzone- Clementi. Clementi was the name of his mother and his grandfather, Girolamo Clementi, who was versed in the work of Paduan playwright and forerunner of commedia dell'arte, Angelo Beolco, known as \\"Ruzzante.\\" In 1972, Mazzone- Clementi and his wife Jane Hill, a graduate of Carnegie-Mellon, went to Humboldt County, California to conduct summer workshops at their rural property. From this experience came the decision to re-locate permanently in Humboldt and to establish a full-time actor training program. In 1974, the couple purchased the Oddfellows Hall in Blue Lake, California and co-founded the Dell‚ÄôArte School of Mime and Comedy, now known as the Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre. Hill also joined the faculty at College of the Redwoods, where the pair created the Grand Comedy Festival at Qual-a-wa-loo, a summer repertory festival that produced plays of Shakespeare in rotation with musical adaptations of those plays; Mazzone-Clementi served as the festival‚Äôs artistic director for six years.Doran, Bob, Behind the Mask: Carlo Mazzone-Clementi: 1920-2000, North Coast Journal, 16 November 2000. In 1974 their article, \\"Commedia and the Actor\\" was published in The Drama Review TDR (journal). Mazzone-Clementi moved to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1984 and founded a second sister theater school there, named the Commedia School. In 1994 returned to California and continued teaching until shortly before his death on 5 November 2000 in San Francisco. Performing History In addition to his work with the Padua Players, touring with Marceau, and the Piccolo, he worked with Vittorio Gassman's National Theatre in Rome in 1953. Carlo appeared in over a dozen films, including Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. Often cast for his talents as a mime, he appeared as \\"The Cock\\" in the world premiere of Sean O'Casey's Cock-A-Doodle Dandy in New York in 1958. Represented by the agent Toby Cole, in 1958 and '59 he toured his solo show, Six Characters In Search of Commedia. He performed at a number of International Mime Festivals held in the 1970s and 1980s, and played in Birds of a Feather with the Dell'Arte Company at the 1980 Venice Biennale.

The children's natural talent received public notice, which led to frequent appearances at church functions and local civil events. he managed his sons careers, gaining an appearance at Disneyland in California. They caught the eye of Walt Disney, who took a personal interest in them. The boys auditioned for Andy Williams, whose show helped launch them into the national spotlight. As his children's fortunes rose, Osmond put his career aside to focus on the family's musical interests. He moved the family to California to place them closer to the heart of the entertainment industry. In 2004, his wife Olive died shortly before the couple's 60th anniversary. In addition to their children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, their legacy was the Osmond Foundation, which later became the Children's Miracle Network, the largest charitable organization of its kind serving children's hospitals around the world. On November 6, 2007, George died at his home in Provo, Utah, of natural causes. Affectionately known as \\"Father Osmond\\" to Osmond fans all over the world, he was buried in the East Lawn Memorial Hills Cemetery in Provo, Utah, beside his wife.

Early life, education and student activism Anwar was born in England and moved to Scotland in 1986 to study mechanical engineering at the University of Glasgow for a future in the Royal Air Force. He became a student activist and led a campaign against alleged racism at the city's Dental Hospital. This eventually saw the introduction of anonymous marking across all faculties at the University. He left engineering to study sociology and politics, and was still a student when, in 1991, he was arrested by police officers for illegally flyposting on Ashton Lane. During his arrest he was pushed to the ground, and had his teeth chipped. Anwar successfully took civil action against Strathclyde Police. In 1995, Sheriff Evans found that one officer had assaulted Anwar and that it appeared to be a racially motivated attack; Anwar was awarded ¬£4,200 in compensation and the policeman was suspended. Anwar was criticised by the ruling Sheriff in regards to the release of \\"bloated confrontational material\\" surrounding the case with the Sheriff stating the allegations of racism did not influence his findings. Anwar became a solicitor in 2000 initially as part of a Glasgow-based partnership, before founding Aamer Anwar & Co, Solicitors & Notaries in 2006.  Legal career  =Surjit Singh Chhokar= Anwar came to prominence campaigning on behalf of the family of Surjit Singh Chhokar, a waiter who was murdered in November 1998 in Overtown, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The case had some parallels to the Murder of Stephen Lawrence in England which led to a radical overhaul of the criminal justice system and several inquiries. The Inquiries were boycotted by the Chhokar family as they were not public and were considered by the family to be a 'whitewash'. Subsequently the Jandoo Inquiry which the family boycotted and refused to give evidence to, heavily criticised Anwar and said he took on too many roles and also took liberties in interpreting for the family. In the latter case, Anwar led the campaign on behalf of the Chhokar family. He also served on the Scottish Executive's Stephen Lawrence Steering Group, set up in 2000. In 2012, following the reform of the double jeopardy law, he approached the Lord Advocate on behalf of the Chhokar family to request that the case be reopened and reinvestigated. On 2 May 2014 Anwar and the Chhokar family met with the Lord Advocate who confirmed that following reinvestigation by Police Scotland the Crown was seeking to have the original acquittals of three men set aside in an application to the Appeal Court for a retrial over the murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar. In October 2016, after a five-week trial, Ronnie Coulter was found guilty of the murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar. Following the conviction, Police Scotland and the Lord Advocate acknowledged the role of the campaigning by the Chhokar family and Aamer Anwar. Following sentencing of Ronnie Coulter to a life sentence, a Crown Office spokesman said :- \\"The sentencing today for the murder of Ronnie Coulter has finally delivered justice for the Chhokar family. The family have shown great courage and dignity throughout their long wait to see if someone is jailed for his killing. The family along with Aamer Anwar, campaigned tirelessly for improvements in the way allegations of racial crimes were dealt with and the justice system has transformed how it deals with racial crimes as a result\\". Detective Chief Superintendant Clark Cuzen following the verdict said \\"If Darshan Singh Chhokar was alive today i can only imagine his feelings at seeing justice done. It is important to recognise the tireless campaigning for justice over the years by the Chhokar family and their lawyer Aamer Anwar. I hope they can take some comfort from today's verdict\\". ='TC' Campbell= In 2004 Anwar was the solicitor for 'TC' Campbell and successfully appealed to have Campbell's murder conviction overturned; Campbell had spent 20 years in jail for the murders that were known as the Ice Cream Wars. =Tommy Sheridan= In 2010 he acted as solicitor for Tommy Sheridan in HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan. Sheridan sacked Anwar following a bitter dispute between the two men over the lawyer's refusal to stop writing a column for a newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch. In July 2011 Anwar presented a dossier along with Tom Watson MP to Strathclyde Police into alleged criminality at the News of the World, allegations of phone hacking and data breaches and corruption in the police, as part of the wider News International phone hacking scandal. This led to a full-scale police inquiry by Strathclyde Police termed Operation Rubicon and the subsequent arrest of Andy Coulson and Bob Bird, Scottish Editor of News of the World. =Other= On 2 October 2012 he gave evidence to the Scottish Parliament's Justice Committee arguing against allowing cameras into criminal trials. On 5 June 2014 it was announced that Anwar had lodged an appeal on behalf of the family of Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi, who was convicted of the worst single act of mass murder on British soil in 2001 for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 over Lockerbie. The Libyan Al-Megrahi died from cancer following his compassionate release from Prison while an application was being lodged with the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission seeking to review his case and return it to the appeal court as a 'miscarriage of justice'. Aamer Anwar was also instructed by 24 British relatives of passengers who died on the flight including Dr. Jim Swire. In September 2014, Anwar began representing the family of Jihadi bride Aqsa Mahmood, a 20-year-old woman from Glasgow who travelled to Syria to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In 2017 he was instructed by the family of Sheku Bayoh, a 31-year-old man who died in 2015 after being restrained by police officers. The family met the Lord Advocate, believing that Pirc's investigation had been fundamentally flawed. In February 2017 he represented the family of murder victim Emma Caldwell, when they met the Lord Advocate who had directed a second murder inquiry that was underway. He also represented two now former Scottish National Party MPs. He briefly represented Michelle Thomson and later Natalie McGarry. Campaigning He was an active participant in the Stop the War Coalition, and campaigned against the 31st G8 summit at Gleneagles. He has been a longstanding critic of the Dungavel Detention Centre for failed asylum seekers. He is a trustee of the Time for Inclusive Education campaign for LGBT inclusive education in Scottish schools. Rector of the University of Glasgow In 2008 Anwar was runner-up in the election for Rector of the University of Glasgow, losing the race for the position to Charles Kennedy. Edward Snowden followed Kennedy for a three-year term of office which finished in 2017, when Anwar was again nominated for this role. On 21 March he was announced as having been elected by the students with over 54% of the vote (4,458), beating the eleven other candidates including High Court Judge Lady Hazel Cosgrove who came second with 1,409 votes, whilst political speaker and writer Milo Yiannopoulos came fourth with 533 votes. All the candidates were eliminated in the first round due to the 'landslide' result in Anwar's favour. He took office on 31 March 2017 and was installed at a ceremony on 19 April 2017. The Times Scottish edition reported in June 2018 that Anwar had failed to hold a single surgery for the first 11 months of his rectorship; a claim backed up by Glasgow University. Anwar been criticised for publicly accusing the university of showing \\"callous disregard\\" for students and staff, treating international students as \\"cash cows\\" and claiming to have uncovered serious cases of racism and sexual harassment. However, officials at the university insisted that when they asked for specific details so they could launch investigations, none were provided. Awards and honours Anwar was named Solicitor of the Year in the Herald's Law Awards of Scotland 2018. Anwar was named \\"Lawyer of the Year\\" at the fourteenth Scottish Legal Awards in March 2017. He had been named \\"Solicitor of the Year\\" in the Herald's Law Awards of Scotland in November 2016. His firm picked up \\"Criminal Law Firm of the Year\\" at the Law Awards of Scotland in 2006 and again in 2014. At the Lloyds TSB Jewel Awards in 2007, he received the Professional Excellence Award as a 'recognition of his outstanding achievements and the huge impact his work has had UK wide'. In December 2007 the law magazine The Firm placed him ninth in a feature of top 100 most powerful and influential people in the Scottish justice system and legal profession. In January 2013, he was nominated for the Services to Law award at the British Muslim Awards. In 2014 he was awarded the Scottish Muslim Award‚ÄîAl Adl Ihsan for Public Services (Adl and Ihsan are Arabic terms for evoking the importance of justice and charity in Islam). He was given the award by Baroness Syeda Warsi on 11 May 2014.  Controversies  On 9 January 2008 Sheriff Charlotte Coutts described Anwar's evidence as 'not credible' during a trial in which he claimed to be the victim of racial abuse. Anwar made controversial statements in the aftermath of the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack, in which he claimed, \\"That there is no difference between a stealth bomber and a suicide bomber, the effects are still the same\\". In further remarks he argued that there was a moral equivalence between the 9/11 hijackers and the United States when they bomb innocent civilians. In 2008 he faced allegations of contempt of court in the light of a complaint by the presiding judge in the case, Lord Carloway, after Anwar directly attacked the jury following the trial and conviction of Mohammed Siddique in the High Court of Justiciary. In a lengthy statement, the judge accused Mr Anwar of making unprofessional, defamatory and factually inaccurate attacks on the judiciary, the jury and the wider legal process. The solicitor, he added, was \\"hiding behind the cloak of his client\\" to make politically motivated attacks on anti-terrorism legislation - criticisms the judge claimed were out of bounds for a lawyer. It was the first hearing of its kind in the UK. He was the first lawyer in the UK to be put on trial for contempt of court for comments he made on behalf of his client at the end of a trial. Iain Banks, the author, joined Labour politician Tony Benn, Respect MP George Galloway, Bashir Maan, convener of the Muslim Council of Scotland and human rights lawyer Gareth Pierce, among others to argue that such a prosecution was detrimental to free speech. While finding Anwar's comments to be \\"misleading\\" Lord Osborne did not find him in contempt of court. However he still strongly criticised Anwar's behaviour stating that statements from the lawyer were politically motivated and largely consisted of \\"angry and petulant criticism\\" Further stating the court is entitled to expect better of those who practice before it.

Mastala is part of Narali Union Council. Population The founder and great grand father of the main clan was \\"MAST KHAN\\". Thus was the name of the village derived as \\"MASTala\\". Local tradition narrates his arrival in the territory some time during the 16th century A.D. Those were early days Mughal Dynastic rule of the Sub Continent. He had the vision and foresight of locating his settlement on the best vantage point in the area available. Majority of Mastala's population consists of his descendants. They belong to the sub caste'Minhas' of Rajputs'Pakhral' of Rajputs, and almost 95% people of the village are of the same clan. Rest of the population consists of minor castes, historically known to benefit from the services rendered to the only major caste. Religion of 100% population is 'Sunni Islam Natural resources/oil and gas deposits Mastala is rich in vast deposits of natural resources like oil and gas deposits. Its oil and gas site is known as Adhi Field. It is a joint venture (JV) between PPL as operator, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Pakistan Oilfields Limited (POL), with working interest of 39, 50 and 11 percent, respectively. Field is located about 70 km south of Islamabad in the Pothwar region. Exploration at Adhi began in 1956 and continued for a decade during which four wells were drilled. But all of them were abandoned due to insurmountable high pressure formation water inflows and subsurface complications. In 1976, a seismic survey was carried out that led to the drilling of Adhi 5, a discovery well, in 1978, proving the presence of hydrocarbons. Crude oil production from the field commenced in the early 1980s from Sakesar reservoir. Other two reservoirs discovered were Tobra & Khewra bearing gas/ condensate. Adhi was declared a commercial discovery in June 1984. However, production from Sakesar was suspended in 1986 due to excessive water in produced crude. Subsequently, field was developed on Tobra/ Khewra reservoir and an LPG/ NGL plant was installed and commissioned in January 1991. Following the 3D seismic survey in 1998, indicating additional oil and gas potential, a re-evaluation of reserves was undertaken which predicted increased recoverable reserves in Khewra and Tobra reservoirs. As a result, five additional wells were drilled. The existing LPG/ NGL recovery facilities were enhanced by installing another plant of a similar capacity which was commissioned in September 2006, doubling production from the field. A Compositional Reservoir Study was conducted in 2011, based on which further development is being carried out. To date, a total of 22 wells have been drilled in Adhi, including recently drilled well Adhi-22, of which 13 wells are currently on production from Tobra-Khewra reservoir and two from the Sakesar formation. An early production facility was also installed between 2002 and 2003 to obtain production from Sakesar wells. Adhi's major clients are SNGPL for gas, Attock Refinery Limited for NGL / crude oil and various LPG marketing companies. * Discovery: 1978 *Producing Wells: 15 (still growing) * Recoverable Reserves: ** gas ** oil ** NGL ** 1,457 Thousand tonnes LPG * Daily Average Production: ** at standard conditions ** ** ** 154 tonnes LPG Adhi oil field is considered one of the top 10 oil and gas fields in Pakistan. Agriculture Mastala's irrigation mostly depends on rain because there is no river flowing near by this area and agriculture is dependent on rains. For storing water, 3 small pounds and one big pound have been constructed by the people of Mastala using their own resources. =Major crops= Major crops grown in the village include wheat, maize, peanut, gram, millet and mustard. Literacy rate Mastala has a reasonable literacy rate. Majority of population have education till matriculation and intermediate level . Among new generation, several students are pursuing their studies in different cities of Pakistan such as Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, etc. Importantly, some of students from Mastala are studying abroad. Remarkably, one of the female who not only got scholarship to pursue her MS and PhD studies in world renowned universities, but she also served at a prestigious university like NUST for few years and now working in a foreign country as a foreign research expert. Similarly, another female who belongs to this village is serving in army as medical doctor. In addition to this remarkable example, several other females have completed their master's degrees from different universities in Pakistan in diverse field of studies like business administration, statistics, history, biology, education and English., etc., Male population is not far behind females. There are some of the engineers, who have completed their degrees in different field and are now serving their nation. Among both females and males population, there are few people who have reached to 18 and 19 grades. Unfortunately, there is only primary schools for both females and males students from government. Thus most of the students have to study in nearby town in private schools and some in government schools. Employment Farming and rearing of livestock has traditionally been the major occupation of the people. However, since the arrival of PPL at the local Adhi Oil and Gas field, majority of work force is currently employed at PPL and associated LPG filling plants including WAK Gas, SUN Gas, CAP Gas and PARCO PEARL GAS. A good percentage is employed in Pakistan Army. Pakistan water and Power Dovelpement authority. Teaching is a major occupation of both male and female members. Presence of PPL along with allied plants has significantly contributed towards financial well being of the people. Sports Raja Mohammad Sharif is one of the most notable sportsman of the Mastala, he has represented Pakistan as a boxer in national and international sports events and won several titles for Pakistan. Cricket, football and volleyball are commonly played games of the place. Public transport Minibus and suzuki pickups are use as public transport and Auto Rickshaw are also used by the people.

The statement continues as follows: ‚ÄúThe law in relation to section 57 of Terrorism Act 2000 has, since the trial judge charged the jury, further developed through a number of decisions in the English courts. ‚ÄúAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Court‚Äôs judgment, the Crown has decided not to seek authority for a retrial. The fact that Mr Siddique has already served the majority of his sentence for charge 1, and has de facto served his sentence in full for the other terrorist offences, of which he remains convicted, means that a retrial would have little practical effect. Accordingly, the Crown has concluded that a retrial would not be in the public interest. \\"Mohammed Atif Siddique remains convicted of the other charges on the indictment which were: * section 54 of the Terrorism Act 2000: setting up websites providing links to documents providing instructions on how to operate weaponry and make explosives * section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006: circulating terrorist publications by means of websites to encourage, induce or assist the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism) * breach of the peace: showing images of suicide bombers, murders and beheadings to fellow students, threatening to be a suicide bomber and to carry out terrorism in Glasgow or elsewhere.\\" References Category:Scottish people of Pakistani descent Category:People convicted on terrorism charges Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Clackmannanshire Category:Overturned convictions in Scotland ","title":"Mohammed Atif Siddique"},{"id":"14106859","text":"Webtag is an on-line bioinformatics tool providing oligonucleotide sequences (usually called tags or anchors) that are absent from a specified genome. These tags can be appended to gene specific primers for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments, circumventing genomic DNA contamination. Background RT-PCR is a technique used for the detection of even very low copy mRNA transcripts. The sensitivity of the technique also makes it susceptible to DNA contamination. Since PCR is unable to distinguish between cDNA targets and genomic DNA contamination, false positives and/or erroneous quantitative results are possible. In order to overcome genomic DNA contamination in transcriptional studies, reverse template-specific polymerase chain reaction, a modification of RT-PCR is used. The possibility of using tags whose sequences are not found in the genome further improves reverse specific polymerase chain reaction experiments. The use of anchors, or tags, in the 5' region of a gene specific primer or poly-T tail allows for RNA- specific amplification, and constitutes a viable strategy. Techniques such as RS-PCR and (EXACT) RT-PCR are based on the integration of such tags (unique sequences not present in genomic DNA) in the 5' end of the first strand cDNA, permitting RNA-specific amplification without loss of sensitivity. Webtag This web based service builds on the Tagenerator tool, but is very fast because all tags are pre-generated and stored in a database. It is also a significant improvement since Webtag takes into account the interactions of the tag with the primers to be used in the experiment. Having it as a web based service also means that the molecular biologist doesn't have to download and install software with all the dependencies on their own computer. Webtag generates tags that combine genome absence with good priming properties for RT-PCR based experiments. The use of such tags will deliberately not result in PCR amplification of genomic DNA, permitting the exclusive amplification of cDNA, therefore circumventing the effects of genomic DNA contamination in an RNA sample.

August 1653 ‚Äì October 10, 1723) was a wealthy physician, land owner, and colonial governor of the Province of New York. Early life He was christened August 17, 1653 at Corlaer's Hook Plantation, New York, the second son of Wilhelmus Hendricksen Beekman (1623‚Äì1707) and Catalina De Boogh. His father was a Dutch immigrant who came to New Amsterdam from the Netherlands on the same vessel as Peter Stuyvesant. Wilhelmus soon became Treasurer of the Dutch West India Company and later became the Mayor of New York City, Governor of Delaware from 1653 to 1664, and Governor of Pennsylvania from 1658 to 1663. His elder brother was Hendrick Beekman. Career In 1681, he was captain of militia at Flatbush, and in 1689, he was appointed Major of all the horse and foot in Kings County. From 1690 to 1691, he was a member of Jacob Leisler's Council and government, which led to what is known as Leisler's Rebellion. In 1691, when Henry Sloughter came to America as Deputy Governor to succeed Francis Nicholson, whose government had been overthrown by Leisler after the accession of William of Orange, Beekman was arrested along with Leisler and others. Beekman served 17 months in prison, but was pardoned afterward, unlike Leisler, who was hanged. Gov. Benjamin Fletcher, who succeeded Sloughter, was succeeded by Richard Coote. In 1700, Beekman was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel, and then Colonel, under the Earl of Bellomont. After Bellomont died in 1701, Viscount Cornbury was appointed as his successor and began his administration on the May 3, 1702. His advising Council consisted of: Beekman, William Atwood, William Smith, Peter Schuyler, Abraham de Peyster, Samuel Staats, Robert Walters, Sampson Shelton Broughton, Wolfgang William Romer, William Lawrence, and Rip Van Dam. In 1710, he was elected President of the Council and Acting Governor of New York. He was the acting governor of the Province of New York until the arrival of Governor Hunter, from April 10, 1710 to June 14, 1710. =Real estate= In addition to his estate in Flatbush, Beekman owned three large farms in the Province of New Jersey. One farm extended for two miles along the Raritan River and contained 1,800 acres, held jointly with Laford Paterson, also of Flatbush, that was purchased for ¬£366. Another farm of 4,000 acres in Somerset County, New Jersey, was purchased in 1702 from Thomas Hart of England, one of the 24 Proprietors of East Jersey, through his attorney, Rip Van Dam. The third farm was 608 acres on the Millstone River. His sons Christopher, Adrian, and William latet became the owners of large tracts of these lands. Personal life On August 29, 1677, he married Magdalena Abeel (c. 1662‚Äì1745), the eldest daughter of Christopher Janse Abeel (1621‚Äì1684) and Neeltje Jans Kroom.

By the time of his death in 1837, Burton had built over 3000 properties, and his buildings covered over 250 acres of central London. His imperative contribution to the development of the West End has been acknowledged by James Manwaring Baines, John Summerson, and Dana Arnold. Steen Eiler Rasmussen, in London: The Unique City, commended Burton's buildings, but did not identify their architect. The 21st century Oxford Dictionary of National Biography contends that Burton were 'the most successful developer in late Georgian London, responsible for some of its most characteristic architecture'. James built the majority of the Bloomsbury district (including Bedford Square, Russell Square, Bloomsbury Square, Tavistock Square, and Cartwright Gardens); St John's Wood; Regent Street; Regent Street St. James; Waterloo Place, St. James's; Swallow Street; Regent‚Äôs Park (including the Inner Circle villas, Chester Terrace, Cornwall Terrace, Clarence Terrace, and York Terrace). James financed, patronized, and built the other projects of John Nash around Regent‚Äôs Park - most of which were predominantly designed by James's son, Decimus Burton, rather than by Nash himself - to the extent that the Commissioners of Woods described James, not Nash, as ‚Äòthe architect of Regent‚Äôs Park‚Äô. James also conceived, planned, and developed the town of St Leonards-on-Sea, which is now part of Hastings. James was a leading member of London high society during the Georgian era and the Regency era. He was an early member of the Athenaeum Club, London, whose Clubhouse his company built to the design of his son Decimus Burton, who was the Club's 'prime member'. James was a close friend of Princess Victoria (the future Queen Victoria), and with the Duchess of Kent. He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers, and Sheriff of Kent. James was the father of William Ford Burton, the gunpowder manufacturer; of James Burton, the Egyptologist; of Henry Burton, the physician; and of Decimus Burton, the architect; amongst others; and the grandfather of Henry Marley Burton, the architect, and of Constance Mary Fearon, the founder of the Francis Bacon Society. The Burton family mansion, The Holme in Regent's Park, which was built by James's company to a design by his son Decimus Burton, was described by 20th century architectural critic Ian Nairn as 'a definition of Western civilization in a single view'. Burton's mansion, The Holme in Regent's Park, which was built by his company and designed by his son Decimus Burton, has been described as 'one of the most desirable private homes in London' by architectural scholar Guy Williams, and 'a definition of Western civilization in a single view' by architectural critic Ian Nairn Family James Burton was born in Strand, London, as James Haliburton, on 29 July 1761. He was the son of William Haliburton (1731‚Äì1785), a London property developer of Scottish descent, whose family originated in Roxburghshire, and of Mary Foster (previously Mary Johnson) (1735‚Äì1785), whom his father married in 1760. Mary Foster was the daughter of Nicholas Foster of Kirkby Fleetham, Yorkshire, and William Haliburton was her second husband: Mary had been previously married to a man surnamed 'Johnson'. William Haliburton and Mary Foster had two sons, James and another who died in infancy. Burton's father William Haliburton's paternal grandparents were Rev. James Haliburton (1681‚Äì1756) and Margaret Eliott, daughter of Sir William Eliott, 2nd Baronet and aunt of George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield. They had 7 daughters and 2 sons, William (father of James), and Andrew. James Burton's father William was descended from John Haliburton (1573‚Äì1627), from whom Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet was descended on the maternal side. Burton was a cousin of the Canadian author and British Tory MP Thomas Chandler Haliburton, and of the British civil servant Lord Haliburton, who was the first native Canadian to be raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom. James (b.1761) was christened with the name 'James Haliburton' at Presbyterian Chapel, Soho, London. He shortened his surname to Burton in 1794, subsequent to a dispute with his family, between the birth of his fourth child and the birth of his fifth child. Burton was a cousin of the poet Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet. Education James was educated at a day school in Covent Garden before being privately tutored, in which he received architectural training. In July 1776 he was articled to a surveyor named James Dalton, with whom he remained for six years,J. Manwaring Baines F.S.A., Burton‚Äôs St. Leonards, Hastings Museum , 1956. until 1782, when he commenced with speculative construction projects, in some of which Dalton was his partner.  Significant property developments  *Bloomsbury: including Foundling Hospital Estate, which included Brunswick Square, Guilford Street, and Mecklenburgh Square(on which he built 600 houses); Bedford Square; Bloomsbury Square (where the remaining north side are Burton's original houses); Russell Square; Bedford Place; Montague Street; Tavistock Square and Tavistock House (for himself); Cartwright Gardens (once named Burton Street and Burton Crescent, after him) (1785 - 1815) *St John's Wood *Regent Street: Burton built 191 of the houses of Regent Street, and their joining archways. Five of the largest blocks of Regent Street were purchased by Burton in 1817. Burton's houses on Regent Street are No. 4 to No. 12; No. 17 to No. 25; No. 106 to No. 128; No. 132 to No. 154; No. 133 to No. 167; No. 171 to No. 195; and No. 295 to No. 319. These were built, together with Carlton Chambers, between 1817 and 1820. He also built between Leicester Street and No. 129 Swallow Street in 1820. He built the east side of Regent Street in 1821, and the west side of Regent Street, specifically the part between the Quadrant and Oxford Street, and its archways, in 1822. He built north of Old Burlington Street, and the east side of the street between Chapel Court and the entrance to the King Street Chapel SW1, in 1822. *Regent Street St. James (Lower Regent Street) *Waterloo Place, St. James's Burton built Waterloo Place, whose facades he modelled on those of the Place Vendome in Paris, between 1815 and 1816. *Regent's Park, including the Inner Circle villas; Cornwall Terrace (1821); York Terrace; Clarence Terrace (1823); Chester Terrace (1825) *The Holme, Inner Circle, Regent's Park, (1818) The mansion of the Burton family, designed by Decimus Burton and built by James Burton's company.

He could have put up an imposing and beautifully proportioned building, correct in every constructional detail, from the roughest of sketches tossed patronizingly at him by a \\"gentleman architect\\". James vigorously industrious and quickly became 'most gratifyingly rich'. Burton worked as an 'Architect and Builder' in Southwark between 1785 and 1792. By 1787, Burton had established a positive reputation in Southwark: in 1786 he had built the Blackfriars Rotunda in Great Surrey Street (now Blackfriars Road) to house the Leverian Museum, for land agent and museum proprietor James Parkinson; this building subsequently housed the Southwark Institution. When 28 years of age, Burton made his first proposition to build on the land made available by the Foundling Hospital, on which he worked from 1789. He built the earliest part of the Royal Veterinary College in Camden Town in 1792 - 1793. Between 1790 and 1792, he asked the Governors of the Foundling Hospital for a permission to exclusively build on the whole of Brunswick Square, but they underestimated his ability, and declined to waive their principle of not allowing any one speculator to develop more than a small proportion of the ground, and granted Burton only a small part of land on the south side and part of Guildford Street. Subsequently, however, he rapidly expanded this estate with further purchases until he became the most important builder on the hospital's estate, and owned most of the western property: between 1792 and 1802 he built 586 houses on the estate, and, at a time when other builders were struggling financially, expended over ¬£400,000 on the estate, thus bringing the total number of his constructions on the estate to nearly 600. Samuel Pepys Cockerell, advisor to the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, commended Burton's excellence: \\"Without such a man [James Burton], possessed of very considerable talents, unwearied industry, and a capital of his own, the extraordinary success of the improvement of the Foundling Estate could not have taken place... By his own peculiar resources of mind, he has succeeded in disposing of his buildings and rents, under all disadvantages of war, and of an unjust clamour which has repeatedly been raised against him. Mr Burton was ready to come forward with money and personal assistance to relieve and help forward those builders who were unable to proceed in their contracts; and in some instances he has been obliged to resume the undertaking and complete himself what has been weakly and imperfectly proceeded with...\\". The contemporary Oxford Dictionary of National Biography contends that 'there is certainly no doubt about his energy and financial acumen'. Burton was vigorously industrious, and quickly became 'most gratifyingly rich'. Throughout his development of the Foundling Hospital Estate, Burton was encouraged by Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, and his successor, John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, and by the Skinners' Company to develop the remainder of Bloomsbury, including their adjacent estates. In 1800, Burton bought a portion of the London estate of the Dukes of Bedford, and immediately demolished the Bedfords decaying London mansion, Bedford House, on the site of which he constructed several family homes, including the houses of Bedford Place and Russell Square. =Style= In these Bloomsbury developments, Burton again demonstrated his architectural flair, as Williams describes: \\"James Burton became adept at relieving the monotony of long residential terraces by allowing their central blocks to project slightly from the surfaces to each side, and by bringing forward, too, the houses at each end\\". Williams also records that \\"the ironwork in a classical style in James Burton's Bloomsbury terraces was, and often still is, particularly fine, though mass produced\\". The Bloomsbury Conservation Areas Advisory Council describes Burton's Bloomsbury terraces, \\"His terraces are in his simple but eloquent Neoclassical style, with decorative doorcases, recessed sash windows in compliance with the latest fire regulations, and more stucco than before\\". Jane Austen described Burton's new area of London in Emma: \\"Our part of London is so very superior to most others! - You must not confound us with London in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from all the rest\\". In 1970, John Lehmann predicted that Burton‚Äôs Bloomsbury would soon disappear \\"except for a few isolated rows... to remind us of man-sized architecture in a vanished age of taste\\". Burton exhibited his design of the south side of Russell Square at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1800. Burton's urban designs were characterized by spacious formal layouts of terraces, squares, and crescents. In 1807 Burton expanded his Bloomsbury development north, and was also involved extensively in the early development of St John's Wood.Victoria County History: Middlesex and London. Celebrating the birth in July 1761 of James Burton, the founder of St Leonards-on-Sea and builder- developer in Bloomsbury. Accessed: 18 June 2016. He then left London for a project in Tunbridge Wells but returned in 1807 to build over the Skinners Company ground between the Bedford Estate and the lands owned by the Foundling Hospital, where he built Burton Street and Burton Crescent (now Cartwright Gardens), including, for himself, the Tavistock House, on ground now occupied by the British Medical Association, where he lived until he moved to The Holme in Regent's Park, which was designed for him by his son Decimus Burton. Burton also developed the Lucas Estate. Burton constructed some houses at Tunbridge Wells between 1805 and 1807. Burton developed Waterloo Place, St. James's, between 1815 and 1816. In 1815, James Burton took Decimus to Hastings, where the two would later design and build St Leonards-on-Sea, and, in 1816, Decimus commenced work in the James Burton's office. Whilst working for his father, Decimus was present in the design and construction of Regent Street St. James (Lower Regent Street). Simultaneously, George Maddox taught Decimus architectural draughtsmanship, including the details of the five orders. After his first year of tuition by his father and Maddox, Decimus submitted to the Royal Academy a design for a bridge, which was commended by the Academy. Between 1785 and 1823, before many of his Regent's Park terraces were complete, James Burton had constructed at least 2366 houses in London. =Relationship with John Nash= The parents of John Nash (b. 1752), and Nash himself during his childhood, lived in Southwark, where Burton worked as an 'Architect and Builder' and developed a positive reputation for prescient speculative building between 1785 and 1792. Burton built the Blackfriars Rotunda in Great Surrey Street (now Blackfriars Road) to house the Leverian Museum, for land agent and museum proprietor James Parkinson. However, whereas Burton was vigorously industrious, and quickly became 'most gratifyingly rich', Nash's early years in private practice, and his first speculative developments, which failed either to sell or let, were unsuccessful, and Nash's consequent financial shortage was exacerbated by the 'crazily extravagant' wife, whom he had married before he had completed his training, until he was declared bankrupt in 1783. To resolve his financial shortage, Nash cultivated the acquaintance of Burton, and Burton consented to patronize him. James Burton was responsible for the social and financial patronage of the majority of Nash's London designs, in addition to for their construction. Architectural scholar Guy Williams has written, 'John Nash relied on James Burton for moral and financial support in his great enterprises. Decimus had showed precocious talent as a draughtsman and as an exponent of the classical style... John Nash needed the son's aid, as well as the father's'. Subsequent to the Crown Estate's refusal to finance them, James Burton agreed to personally finance the construction projects of John Nash at Regent‚Äôs Park, which he had already been commissioned to construct: consequently, in 1816, Burton purchased many of the leases of the proposed terraces around, and proposed villas within, Regent's Park, and, in 1817, Burton purchased the leases of five of the largest blocks on Regent Street. The first property to be constructed in or around Regent's Park by Burton was his own mansion: The Holme, which was designed by his son, Decimus Burton, and completed in 1818. Burton's extensive financial involvement 'effectively guaranteed the success of the project'. In return, Nash agreed to promote the career of Decimus Burton. Such were James Burton‚Äôs contributions to the project that the Commissioners of Woods described James, not Nash, as ‚Äòthe architect of Regent‚Äôs Park‚Äô. Contrary to popular belief, the dominant architectural influence in many of the Regent's Park projects - including Cornwall Terrace, York Terrace, Chester Terrace, Clarence Terrace, and the villas of the Inner Circle, all of which were constructed by James Burton's company \\\\- was Decimus Burton, not John Nash, who was appointed architectural 'overseer' for Decimus's projects. To the chagrin of Nash, Decimus largely disregarded his advice and developed the Terraces according to his own style, to the extent that Nash sought the demolition and complete rebuilding of Chester Terrace, but in vain. Decimus subsequently eclipsed his master and emerged as the dominant force in the design of Carlton House Terrace, where he exclusively designed No. 3 and No.4. =London Legacy= James Burton's imperative contribution to the development of the West End has been acknowledged increasingly by commentators during the 20th century: including by Baines, John Summerson, Olsen, and Dana Arnold. Steen Eiler Rasmussen, in London: The Unique City, commended Burton's buildings, but did not identify their architect. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography contends that Burton were 'the most successful developer in late Georgian London, responsible for some of its most characteristic architecture', and the Burtons' St. Leonards Society that he were \\"probably the most significant builder of Georgian London.\\" Gunpowder manufacturer In addition to his property development enterprises, James Burton invested greatly in the manufacture of gunpowder from 1811. This enterprise was based at Powder Mills, Leigh, and was managed by Burton in partnership with his eldest son, William Ford, who directed the sales of the product from his office in the City of London. The mills, which were initially known as the Ramhurst Powder Mills, and later as the Tunbridge Gunpowder Works, were that established in 1811 in partnership with Sir Humphry Davy, who later sold his shares to the Burton family, who became thereby the sole owners of the Works. After the retirement of James Burton in 1824, William Ford became the sole owner of the mills until his death in 1856, at which point the gunpowder business to his brother, Alfred Burton , Mayor of Hastings. Development of St Leonards-on-Sea In 1827, James Burton became aware that part of the ancient Manor of Gensing, which was situated between Hastings and the Bulverhythe Marshes, was on the market and could be developed. Decimus Burton advised against this prospective project of his father, which limited his supply of capital for his own development of the Calverley Estate, but James ignored him, bought it, and proceeded to build St Leonards-on-Sea as a pleasure resort for the gentry. James Burton designed the town 'on the twin principles of classical formality and picturesque irregularity', to be a rival to Brighton. The majority of the first part of the town had been completed by 1830. In 1833, St. Leonards-on-Sea was described as 'a conceited Italian town'. Personal life James Burton had a close friendship with the Duchess of Kent and Princess Victoria (the future Queen Victoria), who stayed at his private residence in St Leonards-on-Sea for several continuous months in 1834 and 1835 During the year 1800, in which his tenth child Decimus was born, James was living at the 'very comfortable and well staffed' North House in the newly built Southampton Terrace at Bloomsbury. He subsequently lived at Tavistock House, which later became the residence of Charles Dickens. Subsequent to the birth of his twelfth child, Jessy, in 1804, Burton purchased a site on a hill about one mile to the south of Tonbridge in Kent, where he constructed, to the designs of the architect Joseph T. Parkinson, in 1805, a large country mansion which he named Mabledon House, which was described in 1810 by the local authority as 'an elegant imitation of an ancient castellated mansion'. The majority of the stone that Burton required for Mabledon was quarried from the hill on which it was to be built, but Burton also purchased the stone that had been released by the recent demolition of a nearby mansion, Penhurst Place. Subsequent to the commencement of his residence at Mabledon, Burton employed a bailiff and a gamekeeper, hosted balls, and was shortly invested as Sheriff of Kent for 1810. A diary written by James Burton, wbich records his activities between 1783 and 1811, survives and is kept at Hastings Museum and Art Gallery. The Burtons lived at Mabledon from 1805 to 1817. Burton was Master of the Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers in 1801 to 1802. In 1804, in response to the cessation of amicable relations with the French Republic, Burton raised a 1600 strong company of volunteers, the Loyal British Artificers, at his own expense, which was recruited from the large body of artificers that were in his employ, and of which he became Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant. In the eventuality of invasion by the French, the rallying-point of Burton's Loyal British Artificers was to be the Tottenham Court Road. He attended the funeral of Horatio Nelson in 1806. Subsequently, from 1818, Burton resided at The Holme, Regent's Park, which has been described as 'one of the most desirable private homes in London', which was designed as the Burton family mansion by James's son Decimus, and built by his own company. The Holme was the second villa to be built in Regent's Park, and the first of those to be designed or constructed by the Burton family. The hallmark of the Burton design is the large semi-circular bay that divided the principal elevation, and which extended for two storeys. The original villa also had a conservatory of polygonal form, which used wrought iron glazing bars, then only recently patented, instead of the then customary wooden bars. The first villa to be constructed in the park was St. John's Lodge by John Raffield. The Burton family had residences and offices at 10, 12, and 14 Spring Gardens, St. James's Park, at the east end of The Mall, where Decimus Burton constructed No. 10, 12, and 14 Spring Gardens as both his townhouse and his own office. They also had offices at Old Broad-Street, City of London, and Lincoln's Inn Fields, where Septimus Burton was a solicitor at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn, where he trained William Warwick Burton, who was a resident. During 1820, Burton, his wife, and his children dined frequently with George Bellas Greenough. Greenhough and Decimus finalized their designs during numerous meetings at the opera. James Burton was an early member of the Athenaeum Club, London, as was his son, Decimus Burton, who has been described as the 'prime member of the Athenaeum' by architectural scholar Guy Williams who there 'mixed with many of the greatest in the land, meeting the most creative as well as those with enormous hereditary wealth'. James and Decimus Burton were 'on excellent terms' with Princess Victoria, and with the Duchess of Kent. The Princess and the Duchess, with several courtiers, had laid the foundation stone of a Decimus Burton School in Tunbridge Wells, and, five weeks later, in autumn 1834, they had stayed, by Decimus's invitation, at James Burton's private villa at St Leonards-on-Sea, for several months, until several weeks into 1835. Elizabeth Burton died at St Leonards-On-Sea on 14 January 1837. James Burton died at St Leonards-On-Sea on 31 March 1837. James is buried in a distinctive pyramidal tomb in the churchyard of St Leonards-on-Sea, the town that he had designed and created, where a monument to his memory was also erected. Marriage and children On 1 March 1783, at St. Clement Danes, Strand, London, James Burton married Elizabeth Westley (12 December 1761 ‚Äì 14 January 1837), of Loughton, Essex, daughter of John and Mary Westley. They had six sons and six daughters, ten of whom were alive at the time of their father's death on 31 March 1837. Their first four children were all baptized at the church at which they had married, and entered in the church registers with the surname 'Haliburton': however, James and Elizabeth changed their surname to 'Burton' between the birth of their fourth child and the birth of their fifth child. # William Ford (11 January 1784 ‚Äì 18 October 1856). William Ford was named after his maternal granduncle, William Ford. He was prevented from attending university by a severe injury caused by a fall from his horse in 1806. He began farming with his father in 1807. The office of the Burton family was in the City of London, from which William Ford managed the Powder Mills, Leigh \\\\- which were initially known as the Ramhurst Powder Mills, and later as the Tunbridge Gunpowder Works ‚Äì that he established in 1811 in partnership with his father, James Burton, and Sir Humphry Davy, both of whom were early members of the Athenaeum Club, London. Subsequent to the retirement of James Burton in 1824, William Ford became the sole owner of the mills until his death in 1856, at which point the gunpowder business was transferred to his brother, Alfred Burton , the Mayor of Hastings. William Ford lived at St John's Wood, The Holme, and South Lodge, St. Leonards-on-Sea. He never married but had two illegitimate sons: Henry Marley Burton FRIBA (1821 - 1880) and William Warwick Burton (d. 21 October 1861). Henry Marley was baptized as Henry Marley on 12 Dec 1821: at his baptism, he was claimed to be the son of William Marley and Sally Marley, London neighbours of the Burtons. Henry Marley had at least one son, Edgar Burton, also an architect, whose daughter Adelaide was abortively married to Leopold Albu, of 4 Hamilton Place, Mayfair, the brother of Sir George Albu, between 19 August 1901 and 1915.Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, page 66 William Warwick Burton lived at Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he was articled as a solicitor to his uncle, Septimus Burton (1794 - 1842) of Lincoln‚Äôs Inn.

History  The oldest established ancestor is the knight, Lawspeaker of V√§rend, and Privy Councillor Nils Sigridsson , known since 11 May 1280. From his grandson's grandson's son, the knight, Lawspeaker of N√§rke and Privy Councillor Magnus Bengtsson (between 1473 and 1477) stems the currently known family.

The family members first started to use the name Natt och Dag in the 18th century, why many members' names are written with the family name within parentheses, i.e. (Natt och Dag). The name alludes to the contrast difference between the blue and the golden field the family's coat of arms. In the early 16th century, the Swedish coin was mint-marked with the Natt och Dag coat of arms, due to members of the family being regents of Sweden.

History Old riverbed of the Danube caused problems for the navigation due to its heavy bending in this area. In order to solve the problem, Austria- Hungary began digging the canal which would straighten the flow of the river in 1892. After 17 years, the Mohovo-≈†arengrad canal was finally finished in 1909, and as a result the Island of ≈†arengrad was formed. The newly dug canal would gradually widen and become the main flow of the river, while the former riverbed would become an anabranch. Thus, the island was effectively moved close to the left bank that will eventually become part of Serbia. During the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia the island was part of the Socialist Republic of Croatia. During the Croatian War of Independence, Yugoslav People's Army and Serbian militia occupied the island.

IV (Pacific Theater of Operations IV), released as in Japan, is a World War II-themed strategy for the PlayStation 2 and PC produced by Koei. It focuses on naval combat in the maritime theaters of World War II, encompassing the Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean, with the option of playing as one of four major maritime powers of the time: Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, or the United States. P.T.O. IV is the latest game in Koei's P.T.O. series. Gameplay =Modes= There are two modes of gameplay: Scenario and Campaign. The former involves fighting historic naval engagements as either the attacker or defender with the option to continue in campaign mode if certain conditions are met to emerge victorious. If the player starts with the latter, the objective is to achieve victory for their chosen nation and alliance by controlling as many of the 50 regions into which the world's oceans and sea lanes are divided into as possible. Campaigns start either with the initial outbreak of World War II in September, 1939, or after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941. If the player commands the Imperial Japanese Navy, he can choose whether to attack Pearl Harbor or not. Campaigns occur in two phases: Strategic and Tactical. The Strategic phase involves long term planning of the campaign and deployment of forces. At the beginning of the month, objectives and progress towards meeting them are evaluated or set. If a given objective is met in a timely manner, additional money is earned by the player. Based on where the targeted region is located, at least a month is required to complete the objective. Commanders may be awarded with a Golden Anchor, a Silver Anchor or a certificate as a reward for their actions during these invasions. Resources can be allocated towards ship and aircraft production, R&D;, or to other allies as material assistance, which may or may not be reciprocated in kind the next turn depending on the ally's resources. Ships can be organized into fleets and transferred to regions. Aircraft can be assigned to airfields or aircraft carriers, or airfields can be built in regions. An enemy fleet is sighted during a battle in the Tactical Phase. After this phase is complete, the Tactical phase occurs. This involves ship movement from region to region and combat if opposing fleets encounter each other at sea (opposing fleets are moving from adjacent regions towards each other) or in a region when a fleet invades. For a naval battle, victory occurs if all the enemy's deployed ships are destroyed or retreat within 72 hours. For an invasion, victory for the attacker includes destroying or forcing all opposing enemy fleets to retreat and destroying all existing enemy airfields within 72 hours. If the attacker fails to do this even if all enemy ships are destroyed within the time limit, the defender still holds onto the territory and the invading fleet retreats back to the region it invaded from. =Naval powers= The player has the option of playing as one of four major World War II maritime powers: the United Kingdom or United States for the Allies, or Germany or Japan for the Axis. At the start of the game however, the player has the option of choosing allies, enabling the creation of alliances that did not exist such as Germany and the United States for example, to be played for the campaign. Smaller naval powers such as the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, and the Regia Marina, are played by either the United Kingdom's Royal Navy or Germany's Kriegsmarine. The Soviet Navy and the French Navy do not appear as naval powers in either scenario. =Territory= Each power starts out with a certain set of territories depending on whether the campaign starts in 1939 or 1941. Some of the powers control territory that they actually did not at the time. For example, Germany's territory includes Libya and Ethiopia (both under Italian rule), the United States controls territories in the Caribbean Sea and South America (both independent), while the United Kingdom controls Canada and Australia (both Commonwealth). The focus of Campaign mode is to capture enemy territories while defending one's own, reducing the number of ports under enemy control to zero. Territories produce four types of resources: money, iron ore, oil, and aluminum for the power that controls them. Money is used to fund construction of ships and aircraft, and fund R&D; of new technologies or ship and aircraft types. Iron ore is used for ship construction, oil is used by ships for movement, and aluminum is used for aircraft construction. Capturing territories thus increases the resources available to a player while denying their use to the enemy. Each power has one home port, to which newly manufactured ships and aircraft are stationed upon completion. During the Strategic Phase, aircraft may be transferred to any region, while it takes ships or fleets several weeks to travel from region to region. There are also 14 key regions throughout the world which are vital strategic ports with repair facilities for ships. As not all ports have this capability, control of these key regions is crucial in order to maintain the fighting capabilities of one's fleet at sea with less turnaround time for ship repair when ships are damaged in combat. The invasion of a central naval port in itself however, does not guarantee the surrender of a naval power, and may require the entire surrounding region to be occupied before starting the invasion. =Ships= There are several types of warship available: battleships, battlecruisers, fleet aircraft carriers, light carriers, escort aircraft carriers, heavy cruisers, light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Materials cost and length of completion time varies with the battleships costing the most and thus taking the longest time to construct, with submarines being the cheapest and having the shortest turnaround time. Each power starts out with a certain number of ships of each type. More can be constructed, and existing types and new models can be upgraded and created when R&D; in certain areas is developed. The game places emphasis on battleships while limiting the effectiveness of aircraft carriers, thus not reflecting the realities of World War II which saw the decline of the battleship and rise of the aircraft carrier as the dominant warship in naval warfare. Battleships however, may be sunk by either heavy gunfire from other vessels, or being bombed repeatedly by carrier and land based aircraft. The game also increases the effectiveness of submarines, enabling submarine fleets to dominate sea battles during the initial engagement. Ships are organized into fleets, which can comprise up to 16 ships. Up to three fleets can be deployed by each power in battle, with up to 96 total ships committed to a battle. Fleets begin deployed in a column of two ships abreast with the strongest ships as the vanguard and the weakest in the rear. The deployment of fleets may cause problems during combat when a fleet becomes stuck and individual ships are unable to maneuver to redeploy (for example, due to a land obstacle), causing fragmentation of a fleet. Another type of ship that can be constructed but not controlled is transports. These are used for transporting resources from territories to home ports. They can be interdicted by submarines. =Aircraft= The following types of aircraft are available: fighters, carrier fighters, bombers, carrier bombers, torpedo bombers, carrier torpedo bombers, scouts, and seaplanes. Each power starts out with a specific number of models of each type deployed to the territories under its control depending on when the campaign starts. Additional models or types can be built, and advanced designs and capabilities become available after completing R&D;, for example jets and advanced radar. Aircraft can be deployed to airfields in a territory or to aircraft carriers, although some larger ships like cruisers and battleships can carry seaplanes for scouting. Territories can hold up to three airfields, which must be constructed prior to basing aircraft there. Aircraft so based during an invasion act in a defensive role against the invading fleet(s) or enemy aircraft if deployed, and can be used to scout for enemy fleets during the day. After enemy fleets are found, the land-based aircraft will then sortie to bombing attacking vessels or fend off bomber attacks. Because one of the victory conditions of capturing a territory is destroying its existing airfields, a means of negating the effect of defending aircraft is to invade a territory at night when the aircraft are grounded and destroy the airfields before daylight if their locations are known. Only land-based flying boats can attack submarines. Effectively, during a daytime invasion, bombers can be sent to destroy both airfields and defending fleets, while fighters defend against enemy bombers. =Commanders= Each power has a set of historic naval officers and admirals, including Karl D√∂nitz and Erich Raeder for Germany, Louis Mountbatten and Andrew Cunningham for Britain, Isoroku Yamamoto and Ch≈´ichi Nagumo for Japan and Husband Kimmel and Chester Nimitz for the United States. Each commander may be assigned to various classes of warship from submarine to battleship in order to increase its effectiveness. Commanders are limited to which types of ship they command depending on their rank, thus officers of rear admiral rank and below may not be able to command a battleship and certain aircraft carriers until they are promoted. This can happen when the ship under their command performs well in battle. They can be killed in action if the ship they are on is destroyed in combat before they have the chance to transfer to another ship. Once a power is defeated, all the surviving commanders of that nation change allegiance and become controllable by whichever power defeated them, although they are all demoted to the rank of lieutenant commander.

Today, over 10,000 children, youth, families and older adults residing on the Lower East Side and Brooklyn are served through Grand Street Settlement's community-based programs.  History of Grand Street Settlement  Grand Street Settlement was founded in 1916 by a group of young adults who were part of the Stevenson Club at Madison House (the present Hamilton-Madison House). They noticed a need for smaller settlement houses in helping the under served communities of the Lower East Side achieve self-sufficiency. With the help of philanthropist Rose Gruening, they opened the Arnold Toynbee House (named after the British social reformer, Arnold Toynbee) in a brownstone at 257 Division Street. Eight years later, the settlement house was renamed Grand Street Settlement. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Settlement's main services were provided through clubs for girls and boys and young men and women. These clubs featured art, sewing, and dance. The Settlement also operated a kindergarten for the children of working parents and household management and child-rearing programs for parents. In 1925, Camp Moodna in Orange County, New York was donated to Grand Street, offering a respite location for working girls who needed a break from the summer heat. Later years gave way to summer day camps for both boys and girls. By the 1930s, the agency had expanded its services, and professionals began replacing volunteers on staff. Core programs in the late 1930s and during the 1940s included childcare, daycare, and health and personal services. Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, and continuing to the present, the Lower East Side has seen the arrival of new immigrants, mostly from the Caribbean, Latin America, and Asia.  Programs  Today, Grand Street Settlement focuses on four primary program areas: early childhood, children and youth, adults, and senior citizens. More than 10,000 community members participate annually in the agency's programs which are participant- driven. Grand Street Settlement's early childhood programs currently serve over 400 children though Early Head Start, Head Start, and Day Care programs for newborns to age six. Youth and adolescents are served through programs such as Attendance Improvement and Dropout Prevention, Girls‚Äô and Young Women's Initiative, Boys‚Äô and Young Men's Initiative, the College and Career Discovery Center, and Project COOL (Creative Opportunities for Outstanding Learners). The Summer Day Camp is also a long-standing tradition of Grand Street Settlement and provides youngsters with an array of educational and recreational activities for seven weeks each summer, in a safe and nurturing environment. In addition, Grand Street Settlement is a partner with the Americorps program and provides in-service training for 40 volunteers, and has an active Intel Computer Clubhouse. Programs for adults and families consist of counseling and support services for students and families, including a Single Stop Center which offers benefits screening and on-sites tax assistance and financial and legal help, and a Community Technology Center which is available to the entire community. Programs for seniors assist low-income, frail and often isolated and homebound older residents of the Lower East Side. Services include nutritional, educational and recreational activities as well as a Senior Housing project which offers apartments and supportive services to older adults.

The Fugitive Kind is a 1960 American drama film starring Marlon Brando, Anna Magnani, and Joanne Woodward, directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Meade Roberts and Tennessee Williams was based on the latter's 1957 play Orpheus Descending, itself a revision of his 1940 work Battle of Angels, which closed after its Boston tryout. Despite being set in the Deep South, the United Artists release was filmed in Milton, New York. At the 1960 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival, it won the Silver Seashell for Sidney Lumet and the Zulueta Prize for Best Actress for Joanne Woodward. The film is available on videotape and DVD. A two-disc DVD edition by The Criterion Collection was released in April 2010. It was upgraded to Blu-Ray in January 2020. A stage production also took place in 2010 at the Arclight Theatre starring Michael Brando, grandson of Marlon Brando, in the lead role. That particular production used the edited film version of the text as opposed to the original play. Plot Valentine \\"Snakeskin\\" Xavier is a guitar-playing drifter who earns his nickname from his jacket. He flees New Orleans to a small town in order to avoid imprisonment. On his 30th birthday he decides to change his drifting \\"party boy\\" life. He finds work in a small-town mercantile store operated by an embittered older woman known as Lady Torrance, whose vicious husband Jabe lies ill in their apartment above the store. An undercurrent of violence, past and present, dominates the town. Both the frequently drunk libertine Carol Cutrere and simple housewife Vee Talbott set their sights on the newcomer, but Snakeskin is attracted to Lady, who has grand plans to open a beautifully decorated \\"ladies confectionery\\" wing to the run down store. Sheriff Talbott, a friend of Jabe as well as Vee's husband, threatens to kill Snakeskin if he remains in town, but he chooses to stay when he discovers Lady is pregnant. It sparks Jabe's final acts of resentment, leading to tragic consequences.

It is the third class in the progressive series of state trooper ranks. It is a step below master trooper, yet above trooper first class. For some agencies, the insignia for this position consists of a gold colored 'ST' collar pin worn on the wearer's right lapel while others bear a 'senior trooper' plate that is located below their nametag. The title of address is trooper or senior trooper. Responsibilities Senior troopers take on the responsibility to use preventive measures in dealing with accidents and crime, enforce the law, conduct highway patrol, investigate, and perform related administrative duties in order to protect citizens, visitors, public highways, and property of the State or Commonwealth. Senior troopers also provide mentoring, guidance, and training to newly assigned troopers. They have jurisdiction in all parts of the State or Commonwealth they serve and carry a weapon. Requirements Senior troopers are required to be knowledgeable on criminal and traffic laws, skilled in the use of firearms and operation of an issued vehicle. Career progression Troopers who complete ten years of satisfactory or exceptional service are promoted to the rank of senior trooper. However, it is possible for a trooper to become a senior trooper without ten years of experience. Consideration for movement to senior trooper, master trooper, and senior special agent is based on years of experience, performance evaluation (determines eligibility and used in the event of a tie), discipline, weight control, and educational achievement (used only in the event of a tie). In some agencies, becoming a senior trooper is not a rise in rank but does include a pay raise. In the Texas Highway Patrol, senior troopers are instead positions only attained with 20 years of service, differing from other organizations where the position is given with 10 or less years of service.

The secondary functions are the protection of the rider from airborne hazards and wind-induced hypothermia and of the engine components in the case of an accident. A motorcycle windshield will almost always be integrated into the design of the fairing.Tony Foale, Motorcycle Handling and Chassis Design, , Chapter 5: \\"Aerodynamics\\" The major benefit of a fairing on sport touring and touring motorcycles is a reduction in aerodynamic drag, which allows for reduced fuel consumptionFuel Economy Begins with Streamlining and permits higher speeds at lower engine rpm, which in turn increases engine life. A motorcycle may have a front fairing, a rear fairing, a belly fairing, or any combination of these. Alternatively, a single fairing may partially or fully enclose the entire motorcycle, and may even enclose the rider.Note: such as the BMW C1 scooter History Royal Enfield Bullet with factory-optional Airflow touring-fairing and matching front wheel streamlining The importance of streamlining was known very early in the 20th century, and some streamlining was seen on racing motorcycles as early as the 1920s. Although motorcycles generally have a much higher power-to-weight ratio than cars, bikes ‚Äì and particularly the rider ‚Äì are much less streamlined and the effects of aerodynamic drag on motorcycles are very significant. Consequently, any reduction in a motorcycle's drag coefficient pays dividends in improved performance. The term fairing came into use in aircraft aerodynamics with regard to smoothing airflow over a juncture of components where airflow was disrupted. Early streamlining was often unsuccessful resulting in instability. Handlebar fairings, such as those on Harley-Davidson Tourers, sometimes upset the balance of a motorcycle, inducing wobble. Originally the fairings were cowlings put around the front of the bike, increasing its frontal area. Gradually they became an integral part of the design. Modern fairings increase the frontal area at most by 5% compared to a naked machine. Fairings may carry headlights, instruments, and other items. If the fairing is mounted on the frame, placing other equipment on the fairing reduces the weight and rotational inertia of the steering assembly, improving the handling. The BMW R100RS, produced from 1976 to 1984, was the first mass- market sport touring motorcycle to be offered with a full fairing as standard, and marked the beginning of wider adoption of fairings on sports and touring types of motorcycles. The integrated design included a development of the frame-mounted tail fairing at the rear of the removable dual seat accessing a storage compartment used on the BMW R90S from 1973, also being the first example of a factory-fitted head (or nose) fairing. Types =Front fairings= Dustbin NSU Sportmax 1955, dustbin fairing JPS Norton with handlebar blisters A single piece, streamlined shell covering the front half of a motorcycle resembling the nose of an aircraft, sometimes referred to as torpedo fairing. It dramatically reduced the frontal drag, but it was banned by F√©d√©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) from racing in 1958, because it was thought that the frontal point of wind pressure made them highly unstable even with small amounts of yaw.John Robinson, \\"Motorcycle Tuning: Chassis\\", , p.132 Other reasons cited for the ban were to ensure adequate steering range (lock-to-lock) and stability in crosswinds. FIM regulations forbid streamlining beyond the wheel spindles and require the rider's arms and legs to be visible from the side. However, Peter Williams was permitted to give his 1973/74 JPS Norton a Peel-type fairing incorporating handlebar blisters which helped to reduce the drag coefficient to 0.39.Motor Cyclist Illustrated, September 1973, p.2 full page colour advert, From John Player Norton: The Norton Twins. \\"The unique semi-monococque construction gives the Norton the advantage of less weight, improved ground clearance and better banking angles than other, ordinary bikes. Even the blunt fairing was designed to reduce the drag coefficient to a remarkable 0.39\\". Accessed and added 2015-01-20 Dolphin NSU Rennmax 250 cc Delphin, the original instance of the name Dolphin This was called so because, in early models, the front wheel mudguard streamlined with the rising windshield part of the fairing resembled the dolphin's snout from the side view. Further developments on this design became the norm after dustbin fairings were banned.Motor Cycle 24 September 1964, p.582 On the Four Winds by 'Nitor'. \\"...about 1953, Moto Guzzi factory models appeared with fairings not unlike those used today. The following year the NSU factory took up the idea and evolved a light alloy fairing rather more enveloping than the Moto Guzzi pattern. It had a very rounded front from which protruded a skimpy, integral mudguard; in side view the fore part had a fancied resemblance to a dolphin's snout. Anyway, NSU thought so, and the German models were officially called 'dolphins'. Later, of course, full streamlining ruled the roost until banned by the FIM. The earlier type fairing came back, this time without the integral mudguard peak and with a flatter frontal aspect. By then the dolphin likeness had disappeared, but the old NSU name still stuck and, eventually, gained universal acceptance.\\". Accessed and added 2014-06-30 Full A full fairing is a large front- mounted fairing, and should not be confused with cabin motorcycle or streamliner motorcycle fairings which fully or partially enclose the entire motorcycle. Full fairings cover both upper and lower portions of the motorcycle, as distinct from a half fairing, which only has an upper section, and leaves the lower half of the motorcycle exposed. The fairing on a race or sport bike is meant as an aerodynamic aid, so the windscreen is rarely looked through. If the rider is sitting up at speed he will be buffeted by his rapid progress through the air and act as a parachute, slowing the bike, while if the rider lies flat on the tank behind the windscreen he generates much less aerodynamic drag. The high windscreen and handlebar width of a touring fairing protect the upright rider from the worst of this, and the windscreen is functional. Full fairings can also provide protection to the engine and chassis in the event of a crash where the fairings, rather than the engine covers and/or frame, slide on the road. Half Suzuki SV650s with OEM half-fairing & rear-fairing, plus aftermarket bellypan Half fairings usually feature a windscreen and extend below the handlebars, possibly as far down as the sides of the cylinder block, but generally do not cover the sides of the crankcase or gearbox. Aftermarket kits ‚Äì 'lowers' ‚Äì are available to extend some half fairings into full fairings. Due to the popularity of these kits, some motorcycle manufacturers have started to supply their own full fairing conversion kits and even offer their half faired models new with a full factory-fitted kit. Quarter BMW R90S quarter fairing A windscreen and minimal fairing extending around the headlamp fixed to the triple clamp. Also called a caf√© fairing or bikini fairing, it stops well below the level of the rider's head, relying primarily on air deflection to protect the rider's head and chest from the slipstream. Handlebar A Handlebar fairing, also called headlight fairing or headlamp fairing, is not fixed to the main chassis as with other types of fairings, which do not move. A handlebar fairing complete with screen is like an expanded and extended nacelle. It is attached only to the forks or yokes, encompassing the headlight and instruments, and varying portions of the handlebars, and moves with them as the bars are turned. Belly pan Quarter and half fairings are often paired with a belly pan below the engine for diverting air flow away from under the engine to reduce aerodynamic lift, as well as cosmetic reasons. Some track day or racing rules require belly pans to catch leaked fluids. =Rear fairings= Tail fairing on a Kawasaki S2 mounting the tail light A tail fairing, sometimes referred to as a tail unit or race tail, is mounted behind the seat and rider. Some also extend to the sides of, and below, the saddle and usually providing a small storage space. Particularly on sports/ race replica style bikes with dual seats, detachable colour matched Tail Humps are also available which either cover the passenger seat or are exchanged for it, blending in with the tail unit and side panels they give extra streamlining and the look of a single seater racing bike Kawasaki when tail units were fitted to the 1972 250cc S1 Mach I, 350cc S2 Mach II, and 750cc H2 Mach IV models. =Streamliner= A streamliner motorcycle, such as the NSU Delphin III, uses a fairing which completely encloses both the entire motorcycle and the rider to provide the best possible drag coefficient ratio.NSU Breaks 200 MPH Barrier Materials Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic is commonly used in original equipment sport bikes and certain aftermarket fairing manufacturers due to its strong, flexible and light weight properties. The advantage of ABS over other plastics is that it combines the strength and rigidity of acrylonitrile and styrene with the toughness of polybutadiene rubber. The proportions of each property vary based on the targeted result. There are two common methods of producing an ABS plastic fairing: injection and compression molding. *Injection molding: ABS plastic is melted and injected into mold cavity. Constant pressure is applied to allow for material shrinkage. The plastic then cools and hardens in the mold. Injection molds allows for uniform thickness throughout the entire piece. It gives the most accurate end product that fits well. It is how most manufacturers make their plastics. *Compression molding: The plastic is generally preheated is placed into a heated metal mold cavity and pressure is applied to force the plastic to contract and take the shape of the mold. Heat and pressure is kept until the plastic cures the mold. The excess plastic is cut away and removed from the mold. Disadvantages to compression mold include varying product consistency and flashing, which is excess material attached to the molded part that needs to be removed where two or more parts of the mold meet. Fiberglass is made of woven fibers, and is used as a reinforcing agent for many polymer products. The composite properly known as glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), is normally referred to by the name of its reinforcing material. Fiberglass fairings are commonly used on the race track. In most cases fiberglass is lighter, and more durable than ABS Plastic. Damaged fiberglass can be repaired by applying new layers of woven fiberglass cloth mixed with a polymer such as epoxy over the damaged area, followed by sanding and finishing. Carbon-fiber- reinforced polymer is the lightest, but most expensive, fairing material. It is used on the most extreme sport and racing motorcycle fairings.

It is used in many cuisines across the world, prized for its soft, delicate and sweet taste. Crab meat is low in fat and contains around per serving. Brown crab (Cancer pagurus), blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), blue swimming crabs (Portunus pelagicus), and red swimming crabs (Portunus haanii) are among the most commercially available species of crabmeat globally. In some fisheries, crab meat is harvested by declawing of crabs. This is the process whereby one or both claws of a live crab are manually pulled off and the animal is then returned to the water. The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, regenerate these limbs. Grades Crab meat roll (Philippines) Live crab for sale at a market =European crab= In Western Europe crab meat is derived primarily from the species Cancer pagurus. C. pagurus is a large crab noted for the sweet, delicate flavour of its meat. It is also known as the \\"Brown Crab\\", the \\"Common Crab\\" or the \\"Edible Crab\\". The United Kingdom is the largest fishery for C. pagurus with large fisheries in Scotland and a smaller but substantial fishery in the South West of England in Cornwall and Devon. The best grade of crab meat is \\"handpicked\\" - this refers to the method by which the crab has been processed (by hand) and ensures the flavour of the crab meat is unadulterated. By contrast \\"machine processed crab\\" is produced by using water or air to blast the crab meat from the shell which has a detrimental effect on the flavour. C. pagurus crab meat is widely consumed throughout the countries from where it is fished. Due to its short fresh shelf life of around 4 days, much of the crab meat available through retailers is sold from defrosted crab. White crab meat has a natural water content that crystallises when frozen. Once defrosted this leads to an alteration in the texture of the crabmeat and a loss of the natural flavour. This crab meat is also available pasteurised, which avoids the pitfalls of freezing and should, when produced with care, have a flavour almost indistinguishable from fresh crab. C. pagurus contains two types of meat: White meat White crab meat comes from the claws and legs of the crab and while predominantly white in colour it does have a naturally occurring red/brown tinge throughout. White crab is very low in fat and particularly high in protein, it has a delicate, sweet flavour, a sweet aroma and a naturally flaky texture. White crab meat is versatile and while it is consumed largely in sandwiches, it can be used in pastas, risottos, and salads as well as a canape topping. Brown meat Brown meat is from the body of the crab. It has a higher natural fat content, but is also extremely high in Omega-3. 100 g of brown crab contains 2/3 of the 3 g weekly recommended intake of Omega 3. Brown crab meat has an even p√¢t√© like texture and a rich full flavour. The color and texture of the brown meat vary throughout the year as the crab's physiology changes. =U.S. crab= For the U.S. market the meat of crabs comes in different grades, depending on which part of the crab's body it comes from and the overall size of the crab the meat is taken from. Colossal Crab Colossal Colossal crab meat, sometimes called Mega Jumbo Lump, is the largest whole unbroken pieces available from the blue crab and blue swimming crab. The colossal meat is taken from the two largest muscles connected to the back swimming legs of the crab. The lumps, or pieces, in the Colossal grade are bigger than those in the Jumbo Lump. Jumbo lump The jumbo lump grade crab meat comes from larger crabs and is the meat from the two large muscles connected to the swimming legs. Contrary to smaller portions of crab meat, it can be used whole. It has a brilliant white color. Lump Crab Lump The Lump grade of crab meat is composed of broken pieces of Jumbo Lump, which are not included in the Jumbo Lump grade pack, and other flake pieces. This grade of crab meat is ideal for crab cakes and it is commonly used by manufacturers. Back fin The back fin portion consists of flakes of white meat, coming both from the special meat and the jumbo lump. Back fin is a popular crab meat for Chesapeake Bay, Maryland style crab cakes. Special The \\"special meat\\" is shreds and small flakes of white meat from the body cavity of the crab. It is generally used for all dishes in which white crab meat is used. Claw Claw meat is the dark pink meat that comes from the swimming fins and claws of the crab. It has a stronger taste, and is less expensive than the white color meat grades. It is often used in soups, where the strong taste comes through. Claw fingers Claw Fingers The Claw Fingers, also called Cocktail Fingers, are the tips of the pinchers, usually served whole, with the dark pink meat still in it. They are commonly used as garnish or hors d'≈ìuvre. Imitation Imitation crab meat is widely used in America as a replacement for 100% crab meat in many dishes, due to the labour-intensive process of extracting fresh crab meat, and is popularly used in American sushi (e.g. California roll). The flaky, red-edged faux crab often served in seafood salad or California roll is most likely made of Alaska Pollock. Also called Walleye Pollock, Snow Cod, or Whiting, this fish is abundant in the Bering Sea near Alaska and can also be found along the central California coast and in the Sea of Japan. Pollock has a very mild flavor, making it ideal for the processing and artificial flavoring of imitation crab. While Pollock is the most common fish used to make imitation crab, New Zealand Hoki is also used, and some Asian manufacturers use Southeast Asian fish like Golden Treadfin Bream and White Croaker.http://ask.yahoo.com/20030110.html The processing of imitation crabmeat begins with the skinning and boning of the fish. Then the meat is minced and rinsed, and the water is leached out. This creates a thick paste called surimi. The word means \\"minced fish\\" in Japanese, and the essential techniques for making it were developed in Japan over 800 years ago. Surimi is commonly used in Japan to make a type of fish ball or cake called kamaboko. In 1975, a method for processing imitation crabmeat from surimi was invented in Japan, and in 1983, American companies started production. Animal welfare Declawing of crabs is the process whereby one or both claws of a live crab are manually pulled off and the animal is then returned to the water. It occurs in several fisheries worldwide, such as in the Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) fishery, the north-east Atlantic deep-water red crab (Chaceon affinis) fishery and in southern Iberia, where the major claws of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri are harvested. There is scientific debate about whether crabs experience pain from this procedure, but there is evidence it increases mortality. It is argued that declawing therefore provides a sustainable fishery, however, declawing can lead to 47% mortality and negative effects on feeding behaviour. Furthermore, once separated from the body, the claws will start to degenerate‚Äîusually, crabs are cooked moments after capture.

It forms the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada, extending roughly from just north of the Garlock Fault to the Cascade Range. Tectonic activity Uplift on this fault is about 0.01‚Äì0.03 mm per year. This movement, combined with the activity of the adjacent Owens Valley and Lone Pine faults, is responsible for the continuing rise of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. No large earthquake has been reported on this fault in recorded history. The largest earthquake in its vicinity was the 1872 Lone Pine earthquake, which was on the adjacent Owens Valley Fault and had an estimated moment magnitude of 7.4‚Äì7.9. History Around 200 million years ago, the ancient oceanic Farallon Plate began to subduct beneath the North American Plate. As the Farallon moved eastward, it was overridden by the North American, and the moisture within it was figuratively baked out of the rock before the crust melted into magma. As it began to cool, a large mass of igneous rock was created and is now visible as the granite domes of the Sierra Nevada Batholith.Nahler, Nathan. \\"Creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith.\\" N.p., n.d.

Shear forces replace compression as the North American plate begins riding over with the Pacific plate. On the other side of the Sierra Nevada Range, the Basin and Range Province is pulled apart as the force of compression increases.Kurbatova, Elena. \\"Geology of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.\\" Geology of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.

He has won three Emmy Awards for his work.  Early life and education  In the documentary Beauty is Embarrassing, White says he was born in Sand Mountain, Alabama. After graduating from Hixson High School in Chattanooga, Tennessee (1975) and Middle Tennessee State University (BFA, 1979), White went to New York City (1980) and worked as a cartoonist and illustrator for a number of publications including The East Village Eye, Raw, The New York Times, and The Village Voice.  Career  In 1986 he worked on Pee-wee's Playhouse where his work for his set and puppet designs won three Emmy awards; he also supplied a number of voices on the show. Other television credits include production and set design for Shining Time Station, Riders in the Sky, The Weird Al Show and Beakman's World. He art directed two seminal music videos, Peter Gabriel's \\"Big Time\\" in 1986, for which he won a Billboard award for best Art Direction in a music video, and in 1996 he designed all the Georges M√©li√®s-inspired sets for the award-winning video for the Smashing Pumpkins \\"Tonight, Tonight\\". More recently he has concentrated on his painting career. He takes cheap, mass- produced lithographs which he finds in secondhand thrift stores and painstakingly paints phrases or words on them in a glossy, 3-D style. His works have been compared to Ed Ruscha. Arguably, White's most famous work is his painting Nixon, which was featured on the cover of an album, also titled Nixon, by the band Lambchop. A school friend of Lambchop's Kurt Wagner, White has contributed to four of the band's album covers. On September 16, 2009 at The Modern Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, White gave a hilarious presentation of his work through the retelling of his life. In September 2009 White installed a huge puppet head of George Jones in the Rice Gallery at Rice University in Houston, Texas. The puppet's eyes rotate in its head, and if the viewer pulls a rope, the mouth opens and a snoring noise emerges. A huge fan rotates at the base of the head, with the words \\"dreaming\\" written over the fan blades. The piece is called \\"Big Lectric Fan to Keep Me Cool While I Sleep,\\" in reference to George Jones's recording of \\"Ragged but Right.\\" In January 2009, White was featured at Marty Walker Gallery in Dallas, Texas in a group art exhibition titled There's something I've been meaning to tell you.... The Marty Walker Gallery also held a solo art exhibition for White in 2010 titled I fell 37 miles to the earth 100 years ago. In March 2012, Beauty Is Embarrassing, a documentary about Wayne White's life, premiered at SXSW in Austin, Texas. In June 2013 the interactive, site-specific installation HALO AMOK debuted at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art. White describes HALO AMOK as a \\"cubist cowboy rodeo.\\" In November 2016 White created an art installation in Chattanooga called Wayne-O-Rama that includes huge cardboard heads of figures from Chattanooga's history, including Dragging Canoe and Adolph Ochs, and a large model of Lookout Mountain featuring details about the mountain including the roadside attractions Rock City, Ruby Falls and the Incline. It was partially funded by the Shaking Ray Levis Society, Benwood Foundation, the Lyndhurst Foundation and See Rock City Inc. In January 2020, White announced his fourth solo art show at the Joshua Liner Gallery in New York City, and in April 2020, White released a series of eighteen never before seen drawings that he had completed between the years of 2012 and 2020. This release was done in conjunction with the debut of a series of short puppet shows that White created for Instagram with each episode containing a short joke or gag produced by White. White made the cover art, Curdled American Dream, for the X album Alphabetland due to vocalist Exene Cervenka and bassist John Doe both being fans of his work.

It was the first clash of the War of the Fourth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. As Emperor Napoleon I of France's Grande Arm√©e advanced north through the Frankenwald (Franconian Forest) it struck the left wing of the armies belonging to the Kingdom of Prussia and the Electorate of Saxony, which were deployed on a long front. Schleiz is located 30 kilometers north of Hof and 145 kilometers southwest of Dresden at the intersection of Routes 2 and 94. At the beginning of the battle, elements of Drouet's division clashed with Tauentzien's outposts. When Tauentzien became aware of the strength of the advancing French forces, he began a tactical withdrawal of his division. Joachim Murat assumed command of the troops and began an aggressive pursuit. A battalion-sized Prussian force to the west was cut off and suffered heavy losses. The Prussians and Saxons retreated north, reaching Auma that evening. Background =Political= During the War of the Third Coalition, King Frederick William III of Prussia signed the Potsdam Accord with Tsar Alexander I of Russia, an active belligerent, on 3 November 1805. Frederick William promised to send an ambassador to Napoleon with an offer of armed mediation. Unless the French emperor agreed to disgorge the Kingdom of Holland and Switzerland, and renounce the crown of the Kingdom of Italy, the Prussians would join the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire against Napoleon.Kagan, Frederick W. The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801-1805. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Da Capo Press, 2006. . 539-541 King Frederick William III Curiously, the Prussian army had already been mobilized against Russia in September when the tsar demanded that Prussia join the Third Coalition.Kagan, 530-532 Irritated by Napoleon's violation of its territory of Ansbach in September 1805, Prussia subsequently moved toward an understanding with Russia.Kagan, 535 Napoleon managed to stall the Prussian ambassador Christian Graf von Haugwitz until after his great victory at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805. Soon afterward, Austria sued for peace and Russia withdrew its troops, effectively dissolving the Third Coalition.Chandler, David. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Macmillan, 1966. 443 On 15 February, Napoleon maneuvered Prussia into agreeing to transfer several of her territories to France and France's allies in return for Hanover, which France had previously occupied.Chandler, 447 France invaded the Kingdom of Naples on 8 February 1806Schneid, Frederick C.

The pacific Haugwitz was dismissed as chief minister and on 7 August 1806 King Frederick William determined to go to war against Napoleon.Chandler, 453 =Military= Jena-Auerstedt Campaign Map, 8‚Äì14 October 1806 Prussia mobilized 171,000 soldiers, including 35,000 cavalry, 15,000 gunners, and 20,000 Saxon allies. The troops were grouped in three armies. Feldmarschall Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick concentrated his soldiers around Leipzig and Naumburg in the center. The left wing, led by General of the Infantry Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe- Ingelfingen assembled near Dresden and included the Saxon contingent. Generals Ernst von R√ºchel and Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher gathered the right wing at G√∂ttingen and M√ºhlhausen.Chandler, 456 Marshal Jean Bernadotte led the center column. Presently, Napoleon became aware of the Prussian preparations for war. He called up 50,000 conscripts of the class of 1806 on 5 September and put the French forces in Germany on alert. When he received intelligence that the Prussians absorbed the Saxon army into their forces, he rapidly massed his Grande Arm√©e with the goal of destroying the Prussian army.Chandler, 460-462 On 5 October, Napoleon issued an order describing the order of march for the Grande Arm√©e's invasion of the Electorate of Saxony. Marshal Bernadotte's I Corps led the center column, followed by Marshal Louis Davout's III Corps, most of Marshal Murat's Cavalry Reserve, and Marshal Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre's Imperial Guard. The right column was formed by Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps in the lead, Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps, and the Bavarians in the rear. The left column contained Marshal Jean Lannes' V Corps, followed by Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps. Napoleon directed the right column toward Hof, the center column from Kronach to Schleiz, and the left column from Coburg to Saalfeld.Chandler, 467 The 59,131-strong right column's IV Corps numbered 30,956 infantry, 1,567 cavalry, and 48 guns, its VI Corps had 18,414 infantry, 1,094 cavalry, and 24 guns, and Lieutenant General Karl Philipp von Wrede's Bavarian division had 6,000 infantry, 1,100 cavalry, and 18 guns.

Then it was decided that Hohenlohe would move to Rudolstadt, Brunswick to Erfurt, and R√ºchel to Gotha. The right wing would send forces to menace the French communications at Fulda. The Reserve under General Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of W√ºrttemberg was ordered to move from Magdeburg to Halle.Chandler, 458-459 Marshal Joachim Murat led the cavalry screen. The Thuringian and Franconian Forests stretch northwestward from Bohemia. This area is composed of wooded mountains of about 750 meters altitude. In 1806, there were only a few poor roads through the tract. Napoleon selected his invasion route in the zone where the belt of rough terrain was narrowest, the Franconian Forest to the east.Petre, 75 The French army crossed the Saxon border on 8 October, screened in front by light cavalry. Napoleon was not certain where the opposing Prussian-Saxon army was located, so his army was arranged in a battalion carr√© (battalion square), capable of concentrating against threats coming from any direction.Chandler, 468 Murat personally led the light cavalry screen in front of Napoleon's battalion carr√©. In the east General of Brigade Antoine Lasalle scouted toward Hof, while General of Brigade √âdouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud probed toward Saalfeld to the west. Napoleon directed General of Brigade Pierre Watier to take one regiment from his brigade and push as far forward as possible in front of the I Corps. The objects of the light cavalry's attentions were the location of Prussian and Saxon units and details of the road net. On the 8th, Murat's horsemen seized the bridge at Saalburg-Ebersdorf. A small defending force fell back east to Gefell where it rendezvoused with General-Major Tauentzien as his division retreated north from Hof. That evening, Tauentzien assembled his troops at Schleiz.Petre, 82-83 About 9,000 Saxons lay at Auma 15 kilometers north-northeast of Schleiz and Oberst Carl Andreas von Boguslawski's Prussian detachment was 18 kilometers north-northwest at Neustadt an der Orla. General-Major Christian Ludwig Schimmelpfennig's detachment of 600 cavalry was 20 kilometers to the northwest at P√∂√üneck.Petre, 84 Tauentzien's division counted 6,000 Prussians and 3,000 Saxons. Bernadotte's three infantry divisions were led by Generals of Division Drouet, Pierre Dupont de l'Etang, and Olivier Macoux Rivaud de la Raffini√®re,Petre, 202 and his corps cavalry brigade by General of Brigade Jacques Louis Fran√ßois Delaistre de Tilly.Smith, Digby.

On 9 October, the first clash occurred between the troops of Bernadotte and Tauentzien near the Oschitz Wood, a belt of timber which lies south of Schleiz. Bernadotte ordered General of Brigade Fran√ßois Werl√© to clear the forest to the right as Drouet's division advanced on Schleiz. In the thick woods, the infantry moved ahead while Watier's regiment followed behind. Werl√©'s advance guard took possession of the woods but was prevented from continuing on by a Prussian force under General-Major Rudolf Ernst Christoph von Bila.Petre, 84-85. Petre calls this general Bila II and his older brother Bila I.Montag, Lexikon: Bf-Bo. This gives the names and dates of the two Bila brothers. Bogislav Tauentzien By 2:00 pm, the French were in strength and Tauenzien decided to abandon Schleiz. The Prussian division fell back to the north covered by Bila's rear guard of one infantry battalion and one and a half cavalry regiments. Drouet attacked Schleiz at 4:00 pm and drove out the last of the Prussians. North of the town, Murat charged the rear guard with the 4th Hussar Regiment, but this attack was repulsed by the Prussian horsemen. Reinforced by the 5th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment and with infantry support, Murat pressed back Bila's troops to the wood north of Oettersdorf.Petre, 85Google Earth was used throughout the article to determine directions and straight-line distances between Petre's locations. Earlier, Tauentzien sent an officer named Hobe with one battalion, one squadron, and two guns to Crispendorf about six kilometers west of Schleiz. Hobe's assignment was to guard the right flank and maintain communications with Schimmelpfennig's cavalry in P√∂√üneck. When Tauenzien began to fall back, Hobe's detachment retreated to the northeast to rejoin his division. At the wood near P√∂rmitz, a village four kilometers north of Schleiz, the detachment found itself caught between Murat's cavalry and one of Drouet's battalions. Attacked in a marshy forest, Hobe's force was badly mauled and lost one of its cannons. Most of the losses in the battle were from Hobe's luckless detachment.Petre, 85-86 The Prussians and Saxons lost 12 officers and 554 rank and file killed, wounded, captured, and missing, as well as one artillery piece captured. French losses are unknown but probably light. Result Jean Drouet Tauentzien retreated to Auma where his tired and hungry troops camped at 7:00 pm.Petre, 86 Joined to the Saxon troops under General der Kavallerie Hans Gottlob von Zeschwitz, the total number of troops at Auma was 16,400 strong. That evening, Boguslawski's 3,000 men were still at Neustadt and Schimmelpfennig's 600 cavalry remained at P√∂√üneck. Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia's 8,000-man division held Saalfeld to the west. Hohenlohe had 8,000 troops at Orlam√ºnde south of Jena.Petre, 87 The rest of the Prussian army was strung out to the west. Brunswick with the main body lay at Erfurt. R√ºchel was positioned farther west near Gotha, while Bl√ºcher held Eisenach. General Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach led an 11,000-man corps with an advance guard at Schmalkalden and a detachment under General Christian Ludwig von Winning at Vacha. Duke Eugene of W√ºrttemberg's Reserve lay far to the north between Magdeburg and Halle. When Hohenlohe heard about the encounter at Schleiz, he ordered the troops of his left wing to mass between Rudolstadt and Jena before moving east to the support of Tauentzien and the Saxons. However, Brunswick refused to allow the maneuver so Hohenlohe suspended it. In the meantime, Hohenlohe sent a vaguely worded order to Louis Ferdinand, which the prince misinterpreted as an order to defend Saalfeld. The Battle of Saalfeld occurred the next day in front of Lannes' left flank corps.Chandler, 470 Commentary Historian Francis Loraine Petre notes that Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e had a superior organization, employed better tactics, had more youthful and energetic subordinates, and enjoyed a 20% to 25% numerical superiority over their enemies.Petre, 165 The French corps were commanded by marshals capable of managing the details of their organizations. Lacking the corps system, the Prussian commanders were often forced to issue orders that went into great detail.Petre, 27 The French army was led by a single commander who alone made the decisions. Against Napoleon, the leaders of the Prussian army, who were mostly older, frequently held councils of war which \\"never decided anything definite\\".Petre, 166-167 Though Brunswick was nominally the Prussian commander in chief, his orders had to be confirmed by King Frederick William, while Hohenlohe and R√ºchel were almost independent of him.Petre, 29 Napoleon's strategy was simple, but the Prussian generals felt compelled to plan for every eventuality, resulting in a much wider deployment of their forces.Petre, 167-168 On the evening of 9 October, between Winning's detachment in the west and Zeschwitz's Saxons in the east, the Prussian-Saxon army covered a 145 kilometer front. Furthermore, the Reserve was hopelessly out of touch at Magdeburg. Meanwhile, Napoleon's powerful batallion carr√© advanced on a front of only 60 kilometers.Petre, 87.

The copolymer has a glass transition temperature greater than 100 ¬∞C owing to the acrylonitrile units in the chain, thus making the material resistant to boiling water. It is structurally related to ABS plastic, where polybutadiene is copolymerised with SAN to give a much tougher material. The rubber chains form separate phases which are 10-20 micrometers in diameter. When the product is stressed, crazing from the particles helps to increase the strength of the polymer. The method of rubber toughening has been used to strengthen other polymers such as PMMA and nylon.  Uses  Uses include food containers, water bottles, kitchenware, computer products, packaging material, battery cases and plastic optical fibers.

Tulivesi is based on the historical situation in Estonia at the end of 1920s and sets a precedent of the struggle between the Estonian government and the spirit-smugglers. This film is dedicated to those who carry on the difficult and hopeless struggle against the narcotic business. Plot At the end of the 1920s the Finnish government proclaimed dry law which lasted 12 years. Estonian bootleggers living on the neighboring coast of the Gulf of Finland profited from prohibition which staggered Finnish economy. In the fishermen's fictional village called Ropsi accedes a new honest chief of the border guard station, lieutenant Aleksander Kattai (role cast by Jaan T√§tte) who wants to \\"lay down the law and order\\". At the same time the most famous of the village's spirit-smugglers, Eerik Ekstr√∂m (Erik Ruus) drives over the Gulf of Finland with his queuely firewater-cargo. He has spirit cans in his boat and also behind it in the sequential position (spirit smugglers call it \\"spirit- torpedo\\") Lieutenant Kattai sees on those days Hilda Sibul, the Ekstr√∂m's fianc√©e. This role performs by an actress Epp Eesp√§ev. They fall in love, but their good relationship does not last long. In this point start the thrilling escapes and catchings, the plot's sting of the tails. Lieutenant Kattai finds out the very high governmental circles are involved to \\"the Ropsi firewater- smuggling case\\". An Estonian minister Tui (Lembit Ulfsak) and a high-rank officer of the Estonian Navy papa Nymann (Ain Lutsepp) profit the contrabandism and want to bull through dry law also in the Estonian parliament. Minister Tui agitates for dry law using extremely hypocritical methods (indications to the temperance movement). Lieutenant Kattai's background is interesting, so he opens himself: \\"I am lieutenant Kattai, a former soldier of armoured train unit number two. After the war I remained with the border of guard. Until now I was at the southern border, near Pihkva. There was firing every day, Russian salesmen and smugglers, red agents.\\" Those facts indicate to the Estonian War of Independence. Background The first period of independence has always been very honoured among the Estonians and they named these 21 years \\"the golden age of Estonia\\". \\"Firewater\\" movie seems to be tender, postcard-like remembrance of these days. A serious question \\"is this the same Estonia we fought for?\\" echoes through the film. Because of feeling critics named the film \\"the best Estonian thriller ever\\".1 Tulivesi premiered in fall 1994 and received the first award of the Estonian Movie Critics Association. The author of original music was Olav Ehala, cinematography was by Arko Okk. The plot was written by Ott Sandrak and Hardi Volmer.

In this War of the Fourth Coalition action, the French inflicted a severe defeat on the Prussians, driving them from the neutral city. L√ºbeck is an old Baltic Sea port approximately northeast of Hamburg. After their shattering defeat in October by Napoleon at the Battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt, the Prussian armies withdrew to the east bank of the Elbe River and marched northeast in an attempt to reach the Oder River. Aiming to annihilate his opponents' forces, Napoleon launched his Grande Arm√©e in a headlong pursuit. A large portion of the fleeing Prussians took refuge in the fortress of Magdeburg where they were surrounded. Another large segment was intercepted and destroyed in the Battle of Prenzlau. This event triggered a series of capitulations of Prussian troops and fortresses. Blocked from reaching the Oder, Bl√ºcher turned and raced to the west, chased by Murat, Bernadotte, and Soult. After a number of well-fought rear guard actions, Bl√ºcher's troops forced their way into the neutral city of L√ºbeck where they took up defensive positions. Bernadotte's soldiers broke through the city's northern defenses and overwhelmed the troops facing Murat and Soult. Bl√ºcher barely escaped from the city, though most of his staff was captured and Prussian casualties were enormous. The French brutally sacked L√ºbeck during and after the fighting. The next day, the French trapped the surviving Prussians against the Danish frontier and compelled Bl√ºcher to surrender. Danish forces commanded by Johann Ewald were also mobilized and deployed in the nearby Danish-Prussian border with the purpose of preventing any French or Prussian forces from entering their territory (which was the original Prussian plan of fleeing from the coming French to Denmark) and protecting Danish neutrality by force if necessary; however, while they engaged in talks and negotiations with both the French and the Prussians and Ewald himself was detained the French, the Danish forces did not take any significant part in the armed struggle save for a few minor skirmishes. Petre, p 272 The French captured a small Swedish force during the battle. Bernadotte's respectful treatment of its officers and soldiers led to that Scandinavian nation offering its crown to the French marshal, almost four years after this battle. Background =Jena-Auerstedt to Prenzlau= On 14 October 1806, Napoleon crushed the Prussian field armies in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. In the chaos after the debacle, the shattered remains of the armies coalesced into several major elements. General of Infantry Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen took command of one column that retreated through the Harz Mountains. General-Leutnant Bl√ºcher and General of Infantry Friedrich Adolf, Count von Kalckreuth, followed in Hohenlohe's wakePetre, p 200 with a 12,000-man column.Petre, p 198 These forces were trailed by 12,000 troops under General Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and General- Leutnant Christian Ludwig von Winning. The last-named corps missed Jena- Auerstedt. Meanwhile, the Prince of Orange surrendered at least 10,000 Prussians to Marshal Murat's Cavalry Corps in the Capitulation of Erfurt on 16 October.Petre, pp 194-195 Gebhard von Bl√ºcher The 16,000 fresh troops of the Reserve commanded by Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of W√ºrttemberg had remained at Halle since the 13th.Petre, p 202 On 17 October, the 20,600 men of Marshal Bernadotte's I CorpsPetre, p 74 mauled W√ºrttemberg's force in the Battle of Halle.Smith, pp 226-227 The Reserve retreated to Magdeburg where it joined Hohenlohe on 20 October. Marshal Soult with the IV Corps and Murat reached the outskirts of the city that day and demanded Hohenlohe's surrender, which he refused.Petre, p 218 On the 22nd, Soult and Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps invested the fortress on the west bank of the Elbe. After leaving 9,000 additional troops to man the fortress, Hohenlohe marched to the northeast via Burg bei Magdeburg. He was soon joined by Kalckreuth who crossed the Elbe to the north at Tangerm√ºnde.Petre, pp 225-226 Havel River and nearby canal network Bl√ºcher moved northeast from Nordhausen, through the Harz Mountains, past Braunschweig, and boated across the Elbe at Sandau on 24 October. Saxe- Weimar marched from Bad Langensalza to M√ºhlhausen, and on to Osterode. After feinting at Magdeburg to trick Soult, he successfully reached the Elbe at Sandau. Oberst Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg conducted a skillful action at Altenzaun on the afternoon and evening of the 26th. The Prussian rear guard held off Soult's advance guard until Saxe-Weimar's troops safely reached the east bank, then Yorck also slipped away. At this time, Winning took over command of the column from Saxe-Weimar.Petre, pp 231-233 Hohenlohe reached Neustadt an der Dosse on the evening of 24 October. After he crossed the Elbe, Bl√ºcher accepted command of Hohenlohe's rear guard. There was a network of canals, along with the Havel River, that ran east and west roughly between the Elbe and Oder. Hohenlohe's planned to send General-Major Christian Ludwig Schimmelpfennig von der Oye with a flying column to protect his right flank by destroying all the bridges along this stretch of water.Petre, pp 236-237 By nightfall on 25 October, Hohenlohe's main body was between Neuruppin and Lindow, a little farther east. General-Major von Schwerin's cavalry and Oberst von Hagen's infantry brigade marched toward Wittstock. General-Major Rudolf Ernst Christoph von Bila reached Kyritz, north of Neustadt, with a cavalry- infantry brigade. Bl√ºcher's rear guard was near Neustadt after a clash with Bernadotte's leading troops. In an ominous development, French cavalry seized Oranienburg before Schimmelpfennig arrived there.Petre, p 238 On 26 October, Murat routed Schimmelpfennig's column at Zehdenick, sending the Prussians fleeing to StettinPetre, pp 238-239 after losing more than 250 cavalry from their 1,300-man force.Smith, p 227 The next day, in confused fighting at Boitzenburg, Hohenlohe overcame a French road block and pressed on to the east after losing a cavalry regiment.Petre, pp 241-242 On 28 October, Murat attacked the Prussians in the Battle of Prenzlau. One of General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy's dragoon brigades hewed a path through Hohenlohe's column. General of Division Marc Antoine de Beaumont and his 3rd Dragoon Division pounced on the now-isolated rear guard under Oberst Prince Augustus of Prussia and forced it to surrender. Murat then succeeded in bluffing Hohenlohe into capitulating, even though the Prussian was neither surrounded nor outnumbered. Not including 2,000 previous losses,Petre, pp 243-249 about 10,000 soldiers, 64 guns, and 1,800 cavalry horses fell into the hands of the French.Smith, p 228 =Prenzlau to L√ºbeck= Prenzlau-L√ºbeck Campaign Map, showing routes of Hohenlohe and Bl√ºcher The next day, 4,000 Prussians surrendered to two French light cavalry brigades in the Capitulation of Pasewalk. That night General of Brigade Antoine Lasalle and his light cavalry accepted the Capitulation of Stettin after bluffing the fortress commander into surrendering with over 5,000 troops.Chandler Campaigns, p 501 In the wake of these humiliating defeats, a number of smaller Prussian columns were mopped up. On 30 October, Major von H√∂pfner surrendered an artillery convoy with 600 soldiers, 25 guns, 48 wagons, and 800 horses at Boldekow south of Anklam. Bila, his older brother General-Major Karl Anton Ernst von Bila, and their 2,173 troops laid down their arms at Anklam to General of Division Nicolas L√©onard Beker's dragoons on 1 November. That day also saw the fortress of K√ºstrin capitulate to one of Marshal Louis Davout's III Corps brigades.Smith, p 229 Leaving Ney to carry out the Siege of Magdeburg, Soult crossed the Elbe at Tangerm√ºnde and headed northeast. He reached Wusterhausen near Neustadt on 30 October, with his cavalry probing toward Wittstock. Farther to the east, Bernadotte captured a Prussian supply convoy and 20 field pieces on the 26th and reached Boitzenburg on the evening of 29 October. The next morning, finding that Bl√ºcher had veered northwest, he marched toward Neustrelitz.Petre, pp 256-257 Leading one of Bernadotte's cavalry regiments, Colonel √âtienne Maurice G√©rard captured 400 troops belonging to Bl√ºcher and reported that the Prussian was making for Waren.Petre, p 258 Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte On 31 October, the columns of Bl√ºcher and Winning met near Waren. Winning wanted to escape to the port of Rostock to the north, and had already sent General-Major Karl Georg Friedrich von Wobeser ahead to organize the evacuation. However, Bl√ºcher overruled him and proceeded with his own strategy, which was to recross the Elbe at Boizenburg. From there, he planned to either join with General Karl Ludwig von Lecoq in the former Electorate of Hanover or Lieutenant General Franz Kasimir von Kleist at Magdeburg. Bl√ºcher reorganized his small army into two corps. Winning led the 11,000-strong I Corps, while Bl√ºcher commanded the 10,000-man II Corps. Each corps was subdivided into two heavy and one light divisions.Petre, p 258-259 At this time, there were 47,252 Frenchmen hunting for Bl√ºcher. Bernadotte's I Corps numbered 15,450, Soult's IV Corps counted 24,375, General of Division Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc led 2,550 dragoons, Grouchy had 2,432 dragoons, Lasalle counted 785 light cavalry, and General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul led 1,660 cuirassiers. Bernadotte pressed ahead with 12,000 of his most fit troops, leaving the rest behind. Murat and his cavalry were rapidly moving west from their victories at Prenzlau and Stettin. Ludwig Yorck On the morning of 1 November, the Prussians evacuated Waren. Bl√ºcher moved to the northwest covered by a rear guard under General- Major Friedrich Gottlieb von Oswald. Winning marched due west covered by Oberst August Wilhelm von Pletz's rear guard. That morning the Prussians brawled near Waren with both Soult's and Bernadotte's light cavalry brigades plus General of Division Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary's 1st Hussar and 7th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments before falling back to the west. Under Yorck's tactical direction the three fusilier battalions, six J√§ger companies, and 20 squadrons of hussars gave a good account of themselves in the battle of Waren- Nossentin. Though Bernadotte committed General of Division Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon's division to the capture of Nossentin village, Yorck and Pletz drew off in good order to Alt Schwerin that night.Petre, pp 260-263 On the morning of 2 November, Sahuc's 4th Dragoon Division set out from Rathenow and Murat left Demmin (west of Anklam) sweeping west with Lasalle, Grouchy, and d'Hautpoul. Bernadotte was at Nossentin and Soult at Waren.Petre, p 264 That day near Granzin, Drouet's division caught up with the 500 men of the 2nd battalion of the Tschammer Infantry Regiment Nr. 27, inflicting a loss of one cannon and 57 casualties, including Major Puttkammer captured. Away to the northeast on 2 and 3 November, the port of Wolgast surrendered to the 22nd Dragoon Regiment of General of Brigade Andr√© Joseph Boussart's brigade. Hohenlohe's baggage train with 2,500 mostly non-combatants thus fell into the hands of Grouchy's division.Smith, p 230 Joachim Murat Oswald's rear guard made a stand at Crivitz on 3 November in an action called a Prussian victory. The Prussian led the Fusilier battalions Greiffenberg Nr. 4, Knorr Nr. 12, and Oswald Nr. 16, the Grenadier battalions Schmeling and Vieregg, and one horse artillery battery. His cavalry units were the Hertzberg Dragoon Regiment Nr. 9, five squadrons, and the Rudorff Hussar Regiment Nr. 2, five squadrons. The French foot soldiers were from Bernadotte's 2nd Division under General of Division Olivier Macoux Rivaud de la Raffini√®re. Generals of Brigade Michel Marie Pacthod and Nicolas Joseph Maison led the 8th Light and the 45th and 54th Line Infantry Regiments. These were supported by the 2nd and 4th Hussar and 5th Chasseur √† Cheval Regiments under General of Brigade Jacques Louis Fran√ßois Delaistre de Tilly, plus one horse and one foot artillery batteries. All told, there were 6,500 Frenchmen and 12 guns. Nicolas Soult Maison drove Oswald's troops out of Crivitz after a tough fight. At first, the Prussians fell back to high ground behind the village, then continued their retreat. General of Brigade Pierre Watier galloped forward from the village with the light cavalry. Watier summoned the Prussians to surrender, but their response was a charge by dragoons. The French horsemen unwisely opened fire with their carbines and were swept away by Oswald's counterattack. G√©rard was captured and Bernadotte had to take shelter inside of an infantry square. The dragoons were finally halted by Pacthod's infantry. Later that evening, the French were able to seize the village of Meuss near Schwerin.Petre, p 266 During the action, the French cut off and wiped out the 1st battalion of the Arnim Infantry Regiment Nr. 13 at Pinnow. By 4 November Sahuc and Murat nearly caught up with Soult and Bernadotte. After receiving a false report that Soult was between him and Boizenburg, Bl√ºcher decided to fall back from Schwerin to Gadebusch, site of a battle in 1712.Petre, 267 On the 4th, Oberst Christian Friedrich von der Osten with a dragoon regiment, a fusilier battalion, and one company of j√§gers joined Bl√ºcher from Lecoq's corps at Hameln. Wobeser also rejoined with his column. On the 5th, Savary's two regiments caught up with another stray Prussian force under General-Major Friedrich Leopold Karl Bernhard von Usedom at the port of Wismar. The Frenchman claimed that he captured 700 cavalry, while the Prussians admitted surrendering 367 troopers.Petre, p 268 The Prussians belonged to the Usedom Hussar Regiment Nr. 10 and part of Bl√ºcher's wagon train under Major Panwitz.Smith, p 231 By this time, Bl√ºcher's force was reduced to around 16,000 to 17,000 soldiers. Though he possessed 100 artillery pieces and the Gadebusch position was strong, the Prussian declined battle because his troops were hungry and worn out by constant marching. He determined to fall back to the Hanseatic City-state of L√ºbeck, where he hoped to join a force of Swedes that he knew were in the area.Petre, p 269 The Prussian army appeared before neutral L√ºbeck on the morning of 5 November. At midday, they forced their way through the southern gate and occupied the city. Addressing the city senate in the Rathaus, Bl√ºcher demanded large amounts of food, drink, fodder, and currency for his army, but promised not to fight in the city.Petre, p 271 Meanwhile, a brigade of 1,800 Swedes had entered L√ºbeck on 31 October, hoping to secure some transport vessels to carry them home. When they finally boarded ship on the 4th, they found themselves trapped in the Trave River by contrary winds.Petre, pp 270-271 Aiming to capture the Swedes, Bernadotte sent one battalion to the mouth of the Trave and another detachment under Maison to Schlutup, which is on the Trave downstream from the city. Also on the 5th, Soult attacked one of Bl√ºcher's rear guards under General-Major Karl Gerhard von Pelet at Roggendorf, driving it away to the south of L√ºbeck. Soult pressed on and captured 300 Prussians at Ratzeburg. He and Murat were poised to advance on L√ºbeck from the south.Petre, p 270 A Danish force commanded by Lieutenant General Johann Ewald marched toward Stockelsdorf. Ewald notified Bl√ºcher that he was prepared to defend his nation's neutrality by force. Battle Map showing L√ºbeck's fortications in 1806 Most of Bl√ºcher's army spent the night in L√ºbeck. To protect his south flank, the Prussian general posted a dragoon regiment and half of a horse artillery battery at Moisling. General-Major Balthasar Wilhelm Christoph von (Jung-)Larisch with the 2nd Division of II Corps guarded the Trave north of the city. Bl√ºcher's rearguard under Oswald remained outside the northern gate, while a regiment of hussars stayed outside the southern gate. L√ºbeck was once heavily fortified, but by 1806, its defenses were partially dismantled. Nevertheless, the wet ditches in front of its old walls presented a serious obstacle to an attacker. East of the Trave, there were three gates into the city. The northern gate, known as the Burgtor, overlooked a narrow strip of land between the Trave and Wakenitz Rivers. The southern gate was called the M√ºhlentor (Mills Gate) and the eastern gate was named the H√ºxtertor. On the west bank of the Trave, there was only one gate, the Holstentor. The Wakenitz protected much of the eastern side of the town.Petre, pp 272-273 Duke of Brunswick At the Burgtor, Bl√ºcher packed eight guns into a semicircular fortification in front of the gate and added two more cannons near the gate. He placed four more guns on the Bellevue bastion on the west bank in order to take any attackers under a crossfire. In addition to Oswald's rear guard, other infantry were available to defend the position. Bl√ºcher put the Burgtor sector under the command of General-Major Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. He defended the M√ºhlentor with four or five battalions plus a 6-pounder battery. The Hoxtertor was held by an infantry regiment, two horse artillery guns, and four regimental pieces. Other troops remained in reserve under General-Major Hans Christoph von Natzmer, so that a total of 17 battalions and 52 guns defended L√ºbeck. When a delegation of city fathers reminded Bl√ºcher of his promise not to do battle in the city, the Prussian brushed them off, vowing that he would fight.Petre, 273-274 Natzmer's 1st Division included the Infantry Regiments Tschammer Nr. 27, Kauffberg Nr. 51, Natzmer Nr. 54, and Manstein Nr. 55, two battalions each, the Hertzberg Dragoon Regiment Nr. 9, five squadrons, one foot artillery battery, and half of a horse artillery battery. Larisch's 2nd Division contained the Infantry Regiments Kalckreuth Nr. 4, Owstein Nr. 7, and Jung- Larisch Nr. 53, two battalions each, the 2nd battalion of the Brunswick Infantry Regiment Nr. 21, the Heyking Dragoon Regiment Nr. 10, five squadrons, and a horse artillery battery. Oswald's command comprised ten squadrons of the Bl√ºcher Hussar Regiment Nr. 8, the Schmeling and Vieregg Grenadier battalions, elements of several fusilier battalions, and half of a horse artillery battery. Map of the Battle of L√ºbeck on 6‚Äì7 November 1806, showing nearby towns After beginning its march at 2:00 AM, Bernadotte's corps bumped into an enemy column at Selmsdorf, east of L√ºbeck. The French quickly enveloped the Prussian force, a convoy marching from Wismar, and secured the surrender of 1,000 troops and 300 wagons. Meanwhile, General of Brigade Marie Fran√ßois Rouyer intercepted some Swedish transports near Schlutup. After a brief cannonade, 600 Swedes surrendered.Petre, p 275 Bernadotte's I Corps included Pierre Dupont de l'Etang's 1st Division, Rivaud's 2nd Division, Drouet's 3rd Division, Tilly's light cavalry, and General of Division Jean Baptiste Ebl√©'s artillery reserve. Dupont had three battalions of the 9th Light Infantry and two battalions each of the 32nd and 96th Line Infantry Regiments.Smith, p 226 Rivaud's division and Tilly's brigade were the same as at the action of Crivitz (see above). Drouet's division contained the 27th Light Infantry and the 94th and 95th Line Infantry Regiments, a total of seven battalions. The artillery train included three foot and four horse artillery batteries. Soult's IV Corps comprised three infantry divisions. General of Division Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire's eight-battalion 1st Division included the 10th Light, 35th, 45th, and 55th Line Infantry Regiments. General of Division Jean Fran√ßois Leval's 10-battalion 2nd Division was made up of the 24th Light, 4th, 28th, 46th, and 57th Line Infantry Regiments. General of Division Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand's nine-battalion 3rd Division was composed of the 26th Light, 18th and 75th Line Infantry Regiments, and the Tirailleurs Corses and Tirailleurs du Po. Supporting units were General of Brigade Pierre Margaron's light cavalry brigade, consisting of the 8th Hussar Regiment, the 11th, 16th, and 22nd Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments, and eight foot and two horse artillery batteries. At 6:00 AM, Murat with Soult's cavalry and Lasalle's brigade fell upon the Pletz Hussar Regiment Nr. 3 on the southern approaches, capturing 200 troopers and chasing them inside L√ºbeck. The guns defending the M√ºhlentor repulsed the pursuing French cavalry. Soult's corps and Sahuc's dragoons arrived and their artillery began pounding the Prussians at the southern gate. St. Mary's Church in the backgroundBattle of L√ºbeck, showing fighting in the Market square with St. Mary's Church in the background Soon after, Bernadotte's advance guard pushed Oswald's rear guard back toward the northern gate. Drouet's tirailleurs soon secured the Galgenburg, a hill east of the Burgtor, and cannons were massed on the height. Bernadotte deployed the division of Drouet on the left and Rivaud on the right, with Dupont supporting the right. General of Brigade Fran√ßois Werl√© led the 27th Light Infantry Regiment of Drouet in the center against the St. Gertrude Church. At first, the French were stopped, but the commander of the Prussian battery was wounded and this lowered its effectiveness. A second effort carried the churchyard, but then Werl√©'s men were enfiladed by the Bellevue battery, which inflicted heavy losses. Drouet's 94th Line Infantry Regiment then rushed forward on the left. Meanwhile, Brunswick decided to supervise the battle from the Bellevue bastion, so he crossed to the Trave's west bank.Petre, p 276 Undetected in the battle smoke, the 94th Line overran a small redoubt. Then the regiment stormed the semicircular position, seizing the entire battery. At about 1:00 PM, the Prussian defenders fled through the Burgtor, followed by the victorious French. Bernadotte directed Drouet to the right to take the bridge over the Trave, while sending Rivaud to the left to take the M√ºhlentor's defenders in reverse. Other French troops boated across the Trave and forced the Bellevue battery to withdraw.Petre, p 277 Gerhard von Scharnhorst Believing his northern defenses secure, Bl√ºcher retired to his headquarters at the Golden Angel Inn near the M√ºhlentor. He was surprised there by Rivaud's skirmishers and barely escaped with his son and Karl Freiherr von M√ºffling, though his chief of staff, Gerhard von Scharnhorst and the rest of his staff became prisoners. Meanwhile, the French pushed through the market-place and the K√∂nigstrasse amid vicious street fighting in which Yorck was wounded and many other Prussians were killed or wounded. At the head of a troop of cuirassiers, Bl√ºcher tried without success to rescue his staff. Then the group cut their way to the bridge over the Trave and safety.Petre, pp 278-279 Soult sent Leval to take the Hoxtertor, Legrand to attack the M√ºhlentor, while holding Saint- Hilaire in reserve. The Prussians defending the M√ºhlentor were taken in rear by Rivaud's division, though they fought back furiously. Hit by fire from all directions, the defenders sustained heavy losses, including 300 in one regiment alone. Finally, 2,000 Prussians surrendered and Murat's horsemen surged through the gate and into the streets. The next victims were the Hoxtertor's defenders, the Owstein Regiment. Engulfed by cavalry and infantry, the regiment formed square but was soon forced to surrender after suffering heavy losses. By 3:30 PM, the French firmly controlled L√ºbeck, though sporadic fighting continued.Petre, pp 280-281 Hearing the racket as the French stamped out resistance at the eastern and southern gates, Bl√ºcher tried to organize another attack. He sent the Kuhnheim Regiment Nr. 1 to attack the Holstentor, but Drouet's troops already occupied the bridge and the western defenses. The French repulsed the Prussians with heavy losses and forced them back to Bad Schwartau. Numbers of French troops emerged from the city in pursuit.Petre, pp 281-282 Results Prussian King of Bavaria Dragoons Nr. 1 in 1806 The French marshals estimated Prussian losses in L√ºbeck as 3,000 killed and wounded, plus 5,000 to 6,000 captured.Petre, p 285 Historian Digby Smith gave the Prussian losses at L√ºbeck as 2,000 killed and wounded, plus a further 4,000 captured out of 15,000 troops. The Infantry Regiments Owstein, Tschammer, and Natzmer were wiped out and 22 guns lost. The French employed between 30,000 and 35,000 men in the battle.Petre, p 286 In addition to 2,000 Prussians killed and wounded and 4,000 captured, French historian Alain Pigeard also noted that the Prussians and Swedes lost 24 flags, two standards and at least 50 artillery pieces. According to the same source, overall French losses amounted to 1,500 killed and wounded, including the IV Corps artillery chief, Colonel Pierre- Elisabeth Peytes de Montcabri√©, who died on 8 November, following the wounds he had received two days earlier.Pigeard, p. 495. However, the French were not finished for the day. At Paddeluge, Soult's cavalry captured four infantry companies and two guns under Captain Witzleben. Grouchy's dragoons trotted through the city to capture Major Friedrich Albrecht Gotthilf von Ende's force before ending the day at Vorwerk. At Krempelsdorf, Ende surrendered 360 men and four guns, including five squadrons of the K√∂hler Hussar Regiment Nr. 7, one squadron of the King of Bavaria Dragoon Regiment Nr. 1, and a half horse battery. The Bailliodz Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 5 laid down its weapons at Steckenitz.Smith, p 231. Smith credits Tilly's brigade with Ende's capture, while Petre credits Grouchy. At Schwartau that evening, Oberst L√∂ben surrendered to Bernadotte with 1,500 troops. These included the Bila Fusilier battalion Nr. 2, the Kuhnheim, Jung-Larisch, and Manstein Infantry Regiments, plus the Osten Dragoon Regiment Nr. 12.Smith, pp 231-232. Having stormed the city, the French troops thoroughly plundered L√ºbeck amid crimes of \\"pillage, rape, and murder\\". Bernadotte and other superior officers tried to restrain their men, with Bernadotte personally defending several houses using his saber, but the French soldiers ran completely amok.Barton. p. 167 That the troops were guilty of atrocities was admitted by contemporary writers such as Antoine-Henri Jomini and Guillaume Mathieu, comte Dumas. Historian Francis Loraine Petre noted that Bl√ºcher's decision to fight a pitched battle in a neutral city made him at least partly culpable for the sack of L√ºbeck.Petre, pp 282-285 At daybreak, Bl√ºcher stood at Ratekau, north-northeast of L√ºbeck, with the remnant of his army. The Prussian general commanded only 4,050 infantry and 3,760 cavalry out of a force that numbered 21,000 on 1 November. In his immediate front were three French marshals with as many as 35,000 soldiers. To his left was the Trave, to his rear was the Baltic Sea, and to his right was the Danish frontier, defended by Ewald's force. Since resistance was obviously hopeless, Bl√ºcher requested terms and was told he must surrender his soldiers as prisoners of war. He dispatched a document that announced his surrender to Bernadotte and complained that he was out of food and ammunition. Murat refused to accept it, pointing out that the Prussians must capitulate to all three marshals and that stating his reason for surrendering was irregular.Petre, pp 285-286 Bl√ºcher thereupon surrendered to Bernadotte, Soult, and Murat, though he was allowed to append a statement at the end of the document. He wrote, > \\"I capitulate, since I have neither bread nor ammunition - BLUCHER.\\" Pigeard stated that Bl√ºcher surrendered with a total of 8,000 to 9,000 men, with 80 artillery pieces, which constituted all that was left of his army corps. The Prussian foot units that lost flags (in parentheses) were the Infantry Regiments Kuhnheim Nr. 1 (4), Kalckreuth Nr. 4 (4), Alt-Larisch Nr. 26 (2), Borcke Nr. 30 (4), and Kauffberg Nr. 51 (4). The cavalry regiments losing standards were the Beeren Cuirassiers Nr. 2 (5), Katte Dragoons Nr. 4 (2), K√∂nigin Dragoons Nr. 5 (1), Hertzberg Dragoons Nr. 9 (5), Heyking Dragoons Nr. 10 (5), and Wobeser Dragoons Nr. 14 (1).Smith, p 232 On 8 November, the Prussian detachment at Travem√ºnde surrendered to Rivaud. Drouet was sent to the Lower Elbe to hunt down Pelet's force, which was included in the capitulation.Petre, p 287 When Drouet caught up with him, Pelet surrendered with 420 men and half of a horse artillery battery at Boizenburg on the 12th. Four squadrons of the King of Bavaria Dragoons and one squadron of the K√∂hler Hussars laid down their arms.Smith, pp 232-233 Bernadotte first came to the notice of the Swedish authorities with his courteous treatment of captured General Carl Carlsson M√∂rner and his officers. Marcellin Marbot wrote in his memoirs that Bernadotte, \\"was especially desirous to earn the character of a well-bred man in the eyes of these strangers.\\"Chandler Campaigns, p 502 In 1810 he was elected Crown Prince of Sweden by the Riksdag of the Estates and in 1818 ascended the throne as King Charles XIV John of Sweden.Chandler Dictionary, p 53 Notes References * Chandler, David.

Waterpark was the son of Richard Cavendish, 2nd Baron Waterpark, and his wife Juliana (n√©e Cooper). He succeeded his father in the barony in 1830 but as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. The same year he was instead elected to the House of Commons as one of two representatives for Knaresborough, a seat he held until 1832, and then sat for Derbyshire South from 1832 to 1835. He served as a Lord-in-waiting between 1846 and 1852, and again from 1853 to 1858. He returned to the House of Commons in 1854 when he was elected for Lichfield, and sat for this constituency until 1856. Between 1859 and 1861 he was a Lord of the Bedchamber to Albert, Prince Consort. Waterpark was also a Colonel in the Derbyshire Militia. He was the lieutenant-colonel of the King's Own Staffordshire Militia until he resigned in June 1832. Lord Waterpark married the Hon. Eliza Jane, daughter of Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson, in 1837. He died in March 1863, aged 69, and was succeeded in the barony by his son, Henry. Lady Waterpark, who was invested as a Member of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert, died in September 1894.  References  * Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

She sings, records, and performs as \\"Marti Jones\\" and exhibits visual art as \\"Marti Jones Dixon.\\"  Early life  Marti Jones grew up in Uniontown, Ohio, United States near Akron, Ohio. She performed with her sisters in a folk music group and graduated from Kent State University in 1979 with a degree in studio art. While in school, she performed in solo, duo, and trio contexts.  Career  = Color Me Gone = Producer and songwriter Liam Sternberg gave Jones her first studio experience singing demos, and suggested she join Akron band Color Me Gone who needed a lead singer. The band recorded one EP for A&M; Records in 1983. = A&M; Recordings = Her first solo album, 1985's Unsophisticated Time (A&M; Records), was produced by Don Dixon. Marti covered songs by The dB's, The Bongos, Elvis Costello, and Dixon. The album featured Anne Richmond Boston (vocals) and Mitch Easter (guitar). Jones and Dixon married in 1988, and Dixon produced and wrote songs for all of her subsequent albums. She recorded two more albums for A&M; Records ‚Äì Match Game (1986) and Used Guitars (1988) ‚Äì featuring a wide range of supporting musicians (including Marshall Crenshaw, Mitch Easter, The Uptown Horns, Paul Carrack, T Bone Burnett, Darlene Love and others). These albums featured original material (written by Dixon, or Dixon and Jones together), and covers of songs by Janis Ian, Elvis Costello, John Hiatt, Jackie DeShannon, Richard Barone, and Graham Parker. Jones' sound encompassed jangle pop, ballads, and southern-style soul. Her voice and singing style reminded some observers of Dusty Springfield, who mined a similarly eclectic field of pop music; others compared her voice to that of Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt, or Annie Lennox. = Any Kind of Lie = In 1990, Jones moved to RCA Records to record Any Kind Of Lie. She relied more on original material and adapted an adult-contemporary sound. She was dropped by RCA after one album. = Sugar Hill Recordings = After losing her label, Jones, 35, decided to settle down and have a child (Shane Marie Dixon). In 1996, Sugar Hill Records released a pair of Jones albums only a few months apart. Live at Spirit Square was an August 29, 1990, live recording at the Spirit Square Center for the Arts, documenting the Any Kind of Lie tour. My Long-Haired Life was a return to her previous method of blending original songs and covers. Having cut her characteristically long hair when she became a mother, the album title alludes to her life of singing back when her hair was long. The album's cover shows a self-painted portrait of Jones sitting in a barber's chair, her golden locks strewn on the floor. = Dixon Archival Remnants Recordings = 2002's My Tidy Doily Dream was a slower tempo album, featuring songwriting collaborations with Richard Barone and Kelley Ryan of astroPuppees. After that, Jones curtailed her singing career for a time, and focused on painting. In 2003, Jones recorded the song \\"Room With a View\\" for a tribute to Let's Active's Every Word. In 2006, she toured with singer- songwriter Amy Rigby as The Cynical Girls. In 2008, Jones and Dixon released the download-only album Lucky Stars: New Lullabies for Old Souls A departure from Jones' and Dixon's previous sound, this recording began as a request from a friend who was putting together an album of lullabies to sell in hospitals to new parents. The album featured six vocal songs and five instrumentals. In fall of 2009, Jones and Dixon toured, performing a series of live acoustic performances. In 2010, Jones and Dixon recorded Living Stereo, a proper duet album. In 2014, Jones released You're Not the Bossa Me, which incorporates bossa nova rhythms and sensibilities into her own musical themes.

Plot  Antonio (Carmelo G√≥mez), a brazen, individualistic ETA terrorist, travels with two fellow cell members, Carlos (Joseba Apaolaza) and Lourdes (Elvira M√≠nguez) to Madrid, where they intend to carry out a terrorist attack on a police station. Just like Lourdes, with whom he shares a complex romantic liaison, Antonio is caught in a downward spiral of disenchantment and despondency with respect to the organization and the life he has led so far. He moves into the area under the guise of an unassuming photographer for the press, and finds himself falling for his neighbor, Charo (Ruth Gabriel), a naive prostitute with an impending drug problem who is unaware of Antonio's activities. She reciprocates, and Antonio uses her whimsical desire to have their first tryst in Granada as an excuse to flee Madrid right after he shoots a police officer. Meanwhile, matters become complicated when Antonio's identity as a terrorist is made public and Charo's sleazy, drug-addicted acquaintance Lisardo (Javier Bardem), incidentally an informant, gives Antonio's identity away to corrupt police officer Rafa (Karra Elejalde). The film ends on a tragical note as the car bomb (containing 100 kg worth of explosives) and the police car carrying Charo haplessly converge in front of the police station.

Rob Wagner was a magazine writer, screenwriter, director and artist before founding the liberal magazine that focused its coverage on the film industry and California and national politics. Its leftist leanings attracted many of the best artists and writers during the Depression.  Early years  Born in Detroit, Michigan, on August 2, 1872, Wagner graduated from the University of Michigan with an engineering degree in 1894. He worked as an illustrator for the Detroit Free Press before moving to New York in 1897 to illustrate magazine covers. He served as art director for The Criterion, a literary magazine considered the forerunner to The New Yorker. His illustrations of coverage of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the rising star of Theodore Roosevelt increased circulation and gave considerable weight to the magazine's political commentary and coverage. Rob Wagner 1921Rob Wagner wrote for the Saturday Evening Post, The Western Comrade and Liberty magazines among other publications. In 1901, he moved to London to work as an illustrator for the Historians' History of the World. He returned a year later to New York to illustrate the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. He returned to Detroit in 1903 to marry Jessie Brodhead, and then moved to Paris to study art. In 1903‚Äì04 he studied at Academies Julian and Delacluse, initially working in charcoal before focusing on oil portraits. Toward the end of his studies, he joined the Paris art studio of Robert MacCameron where his work in oils greatly improved. When he returned to Detroit he took commissions to paint portraits, many of them life-size, of the city's high society families. In 1906, he moved to Santa Barbara, California, when Jessie, who was suffering from tuberculosis, could no longer endure the harsh Michigan winters. In Santa Barbara Wagner continued taking commissions for portraits. The couple had two sons, but Jessie's health deteriorated rapidly, and she died on August 19 at the age of 28. With two young motherless boys, Wagner left them with his own mother, Mary Leicester Wagner, in Santa Barbara and opened a studio on South Figueroa Street in Los Angeles to pursue his art.  Motion picture background  Instead, he became intrigued with motion pictures as an art form. He wrote his first scenario for The Artist's Sons in 1911. The semi-autobiographical two-reel film produced by Selig Studios explored the bohemian lifestyle of a Los Angeles artist and his two young sons. Wagner's own sons, Leicester (\\"Les\\") and Thornton, played themselves in the film, which also featured dozens of Wagner's original oil portraits. In this period, Wagner taught for a number of years at the Manual Arts High School, where his students included Frank Capra, Jimmy Doolittle and Leland Curtis. Wagner went on to write scenarios for Charles Ray, Hal Roach and Mack Sennett. For Hal Roach he wrote and directed films for Will Rogers, including Two Wagons, Both Covered (1924). He also directed Rogers in Our Congressman, Goin' to Congress and High Brow Stuff, also in 1924. Toward the end of his contract with Roach in 1924, he served a stint as assistant director in the Our Gang comedies. He also was under contract in 1922 and 1923 to write scenarios and titles for Paramount Studios and in 1926 and 1927 for Universal Studios where he was a co-writer on The Collegians (1926). He also wrote scenarios for film comedian Maurice \\"Lefty\\" Flynn for Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation. He also wrote scenarios for Constrance Binney at Realart, a low-budget film studio. In 1914, Wagner married Kansas City newspaperwoman Florence Welch, who told her new husband that he could make a better living writing about the motion picture industry than working as an artist. He covered the film industry writing for the Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Liberty, Photoplay and other magazines. His series of articles on the film industry in The Saturday Evening Post resulted in the book Film Folk (1918), one of the first serious examinations of the movie business.  Motion Picture & Television Fund  In 1921, Wagner, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith co-founded the Motion Picture Relief Fund, which later became the Motion Picture & Television Fund, to provide financial aid to film industry workers who fell on hard times. The creation of the program eventually led to the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital retirement facility in Woodland Hills. Acquisition of the of land and building started in 1940. Wagner was an original member of the Board of Trustees. Other members included Harold Lloyd, William S. Hart, Jesse L. Lasky, Rupert Hughes, Irving Thalberg and Mae Murray among others.  Script  The Wagners founded Script in February 1929 and enlisted noted writers and film people to contribute articles without pay.\\"Seventeen Years: Feb. 1929-Feb. 1946\\" By Florence Wagner, Rob Wagner‚Äôs Script, Feb. 2, 1946 Edgar Rice Burroughs, Walt Disney, William Saroyan, Ogden Nash, Dalton Trumbo, Chaplin, Hughes, William DeMille, Ray Bradbury, Leo Politi and Stanton MacDonald-Wright among others wrote for the magazine. Bradbury was a regular contributor with a series of short stories from about 1940 through 1947. MacDonald-Wright provided art reviews. Gladys Robinson, wife of actor Edward G. Robinson, wrote a Hollywood gossip column. Script was liberal, witty and fond of tweaking the noses of the country's movers and shakers. Rob Wagner (r.) with artist Leo Politi on Olvera Street, Los Angeles, 1940.  Leftist leanings  Wagner, a Socialist, was a progressive advocate dating to at least 1900 during his tenure as art director at The Criterion. The magazine and its theater group, The Criterion Theater, was a magnet for artists and writers that embraced individualism and Socialism. By 1914, he helped establish with Job Harriman the Llano del Rio cooperative colony in California's Antelope Valley. The project ultimately failed. During this period he served as associate editor for Los Angeles-based Western Comrade magazine, which offered a mix of socialist dogma, labor-related film news, advocacy on the women's suffrage movement, and profiles on artists and writers. The magazine also featured leftist writers Emanuel Haldeman-Julius and Frank E. Wolfe. Through the period of World War I to the early 1920s he was often the subject of Department of Justice scrutiny for his Socialist and pro-Bolshevik activities. Wagner also sent his sons to Boyland, an avant-garde boarding school with a progressive, if not unorthodox, approach to education. Pacifist Prynce Hopkins operated the school. However, Hopkins was arrested under the Espionage Act in 1918 for making an anti-war speech in Los Angeles. Hopkins was charged and pleaded guilty in federal court of interfering with military recruitment. Federal authorities interrogated Wagner about Hopkins. Although Wagner defended Hopkins, it put Wagner in the spotlight of the government's attempt to crush the anti-war movement. His defense of Hopkins cost him his job as a teacher at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles.Artful Lives: Edward Weston, Margrethe Mather, and the Bohemians of Los Angeles by Beth Gates Warren Around 1915 Wagner had become friends with Charlie Chaplin and was soon employed as the comedian's part-time secretary. Chaplin was eligible for the draft in both the United States and England during World War I, but was rejected for military service because he was too small. Yet he was under intense scrutiny for failing to support the war effort. Wagner waged a publicity campaign on Chaplin's behalf to demonstrate the actor's support. Wagner also helped organize a War Bond tour that included Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. Shortly before the Liberty Bond tour began some of Wagner's friends informed on him to the US Bureau of Investigation that he supported Germany during the war and expressed his strong opposition to America's entry into the conflict. Sisters Ruth Sterry, a Los Angeles newspaperwoman active in the suffragette movement, and Nora Sterry, a school principal, attended round table discussions with Wagner at his Los Angeles art studio. They reported to federal authorities that Wagner voiced support for Germany. Ruth Sterry claimed that Wagner told her sister that the United States should surrender if Germany invaded. Her allegations were never proven. Wagner's longtime friend, the artist Elmer Wachtel, provided agents with a letter Wagner wrote, which contained anti-war statements and sympathy for the German government. The Bureau of Investigation and the War Department's Military Intelligence Branch attempted to determine whether Wagner was a German agent. Undercover operatives conducted around-the-clock surveillance of Wagner as the Chaplin party swung through the Southern states during the tour. Agents attempted to recruit Douglas Fairbanks as an informant, but there is no evidence to suggest the actor agreed to the plan. Agents also hired a young woman to seduce Wagner to gain access to his personal diaries while the Chaplin party stayed at a New Orleans hotel, but the plan was never carried out. Ultimately, however, agents obtained Wagner's diaries, but found no evidence that he was a German spy.=74 FBI files In November and December 1919, he was summoned before a Los Angeles County Grand Jury on charges of sedition for his vocal opposition to America's entry into the European war, his association with the radical International Workers of the World (IWW) and his sympathies for Germany. The grand jury did not deliver an indictment due to insufficient evidence. Wagner also introduced Chaplin to leftists Max Eastman and Upton Sinclair, and between the three men helped influence Chaplin's left-leaning worldview. Chaplin often participated in roundtable political and moral discussions of the war, which was sponsored by the Severance Club that consisted of writers and film people, including Wagner. Script was a supporter of Franklin Roosevelt's policies. As the world teetered on the brink of war, it often took a pacifist tone. And its wartime domestic coverage took on unpopular causes such as defending the rights of Mexican-Americans during the Los Angeles Zoot Suit riots, the postwar resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan\\"The Hooded Brethren Ride Again\\" By M.J. King, Rob Wagner‚Äôs Script, June 8, 1946 and questioning the wisdom of interning Japanese-Americans. Wagner had written extensively for Socialist publications in the first decades of the 20th century and his liberal views were reflected in his columns and interviews with leftists Upton Sinclair, Max Eastman and William C. deMille. The magazine also conducted extensive interviews with Communist revolutionary Leon Trotsky in 1938. \\"An Exile in Mexico\\" By Gladys Lloyd Robinson, Rob Wagner's Script, September 10, 1938 Script also published articles written by blacklisted screenwriters, including Dalton Trumbo and Gordon Kahn.\\"The Russian Menace\\" By Dalton Trumbo, Rob Wagner‚Äôs Script, May 25, 1946 Politi, the magazine's art director, often used the illustrations of his Mexican child characters, Pancho and Rosa, to advocate pacifist and anti- fascist arguments. Wagner's Script Archive  Upton Sinclair association  During the 1934 California gubernatorial campaign, Script gave considerable editorial space to Upton Sinclair's candidacy while the rest of the film community waged a smear campaign against him by claiming his radical economic policies would bankrupt the movie studios. During Sinclair's campaign for governor, his balanced coverage nearly sank the magazine as advertisers and subscribers began to pull out. Keeping a low profile, Wagner also worked on Sinclair's EPIC (End Poverty in California) campaign writing the text for pamphlets and designing the organization's logo. Florence Wagner The magazine's free-thinking attitudes appealed to most of its readers. The magazine, with a circulation that never rose above 50,000, was illustrated with cartoons from various contributors. The art often were unrelated to the articles and only occasional photographs beyond the covers were used.  Scripts demise  Wagner died of a heart attack on July 20, 1942, less than two weeks before his 70th birthday, in Santa Barbara. His son, Les, a reporter for the original Los Angeles Daily News and later a war correspondent for the Office of War Information in India, took over the editing duties until his India assignment in 1944. Under Les Wagner, the magazine took on a more news- oriented approach. It took up populist causes and critiqued local media, often criticizing as fascist Hearst newspaper coverage and editorials on Constitutional issues and the civil rights of Mexican- and Japanese- Americans.\\"American-Japanese Heroes\\" by Les Wagner, Rob Wagner's Script, January 5, 1946 In 1943, Script published editorials defending Charlie Chaplin, who was named as a defendant in a paternity lawsuit by Joan Barry, while Los Angeles newspapers were critical of the filmmaker. Blood tests ultimately determined that Chaplin did not father Barry's child. In 1944‚Äì45, Wagner filed dispatches for Script from Calcutta, India, on U.S. and British forces in the China-Burma-India Theater.Leicester \\"Les\\" Wagner wrote a column and later covered science and aviation for the Los Angeles Mirror-News after Script ceased publication. Florence Wagner kept the magazine going, but it lost much of its punch because the personality of the publication was driven by Rob Wagner. Wagner continued championing leftist causes by often profile left-leaning actors and directors. For example, Script profiled actor Angela Lansbury, who wrote a first-person account of her father, Edgar Lansbury, leader of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. In March 1947, she sold the magazine to Robert Smith, the general manager of the original Los Angeles Daily News. Smith brought in new writers that added new voices and a much needed lift in film comment. Smith also arranged to have Salvador Dal√≠ contribute cover illustrations. While the publication's circulation rose to its pre-war levels of 50,000, it failed to attract the necessary advertising. It folded in 1949. Les Wagner died in 1965 in South Laguna Beach, Calif. Florence Wagner died in 1971 in La Jolla, Calif.

Stryder has released three solo studio albums, Star in the Hood (2007), Catch 22 (2009), and Third Strike (2010). Stryder's business ventures include the clothing line Star in the Hood, the Cloud 9 X Goji headphone and audio equipment range in collaboration with Goji Electronics. Biography =Early life and education= Stryder was born Kwasi Danquah in Accra, Ghana in 1986. Stryder has lived in England, United Kingdom since 1995. In Bow, London, he attended St Bonaventure's Catholic School in nearby Forest Gate, Newham; He gained a B.A. (Hons) in Digital arts, Moving image and Animation at the University of East London. He began making music in 1997, aged 11, and started in business almost immediately after completing his A-levels in 2006. Music career Stryder's recordings date back to 1998. He appeared in 2000 on pirate radio along with Dizzee Rascal and Wiley, and was part of grime collective and record production team Ruff Sqwad from 2001. His pseudonym Tinchy Stryder derives from Strider and from the nickname given to him \\"Tinchy\\": his height at 5 ft 3 in (1.60 m). In 2002, the grime group Roll Deep was founded by Wiley, and included Stryder and Dizzee Rascal. They were making music that was a derivative of garage. For a while, there was not even a name for it. The name \\"grime\\" was the one that stuck. While performing with Roll Deep, Stryder performed some songs including \\"U Were Always\\" in 2002, which was released years later on Roll Deep's compilation album Street Anthems in 2009. He also performed on Roll Deep's 2004 mixtape, Creeper Vol. 2. =2006‚Äì08: Star in the Hood= The debut album by Stryder, Star in the Hood, was released on 13 August 2007 on Takeover. The album spawned two main singles, \\"Breakaway\\", which was released on 9 April 2007 and \\"Something About Your Smile\\", was released on 6 August 2007. Bonus track \\"Mainstream Money\\" was also released as an underground single in November 2007. In 2008, Stryder released his debut extended play, Cloud 9 The EP, which was released on 31 March, also on Takeover. This was succeeded by him and grime record producer Maniac collaborating on the album, Tinchy Stryder vs. Maniac, which was released on 24 November 2008. Only one single was released from the album, \\"Rollin\\", which was released in October 2008. This track was also included on his 2009 second solo studio album, Catch 22, as part of the, Deluxe 2-Disc Edition, and he would collaborate with American band Gang Gang Dance on their album Saint Dymphna that was released in October 2008. =2008‚Äì2010: Catch 22= Stryder began a partnership with English record producer and songwriter Fraser T Smith. According to Smith in an interview with HitQuarters, \\"Kwasi had no shortage of beats and cool sounding production, but I think he wanted to try and break through into the mainstream, and I had some experience crossing underground over into mainstream having worked with artists like Craig David.\\" The single \\"Stryderman\\", was released on 20 July 2008. It was the first single taken from Catch 22. The second single, \\"Take Me Back\\", was released on 19 January 2009. His third single, a collaboration with the English hip-hop band N-Dubz entitled \\"Number 1,\\" peaked at number 6 on the European Hot 100 Singles and number 1 in the UK & Ireland and became the first single with the title \\"Number 1\\" to peak at #1 in any country. His fourth single from Catch 22, \\"Never Leave You\\", was released on 3 August 2009 with the album following on 17 August 2009. \\"Never Leave You\\" peaked at number 5 on the European Hot 100 Singles on the week of its release. Catch 22 debuted at number 11 on the European Top 100 Albums. The fifth and final single from Catch 22 is \\"You're Not Alone,\\" which was released in November 2009 and samples the Olive song of the same name. In February 2010, Stryder headline toured for the third time, he invited the English singer Example and rapper JME as his supporting acts. The tour was Stryder's second sell-out tour after he toured in 2009 and helped in raising the profile of Example.In pictures: Tinchy Stryder plays the LCR at Norwich UEA BBC Norfolk. Stryder opened on the pyramid stage at the England Glastonbury Festival, on Saturday, 27 June 2010. He also performed at the O2 Arena in England, for the Transformation Trust's first birthday alongside The Saturdays. = 2010‚Äì11: Third Strike = Stryder's third solo studio album, Third Strike was released on Monday, 15 November 2010 and was an unsuccessful album. Stryder began recording Third Strike shortly after he completed his previous album; he then released a promotional single, \\"Gangsta?\\", six months prior to the release of the studio album. This was followed by the release of the first official single, a year from the day he released his second studio album. He began working with Fraser T Smith who had also worked on his second studio album. English singer Taio Cruz produced the largely, along with Fraser T Smith. The album title was picked by the title of Street Fighter III 3rd Strike which was also a massive success. Third Strike features several artists, including English singer Amelle, with whom he collaborated on Catch 22 on the single \\"Never Leave You\\". The album features Taio Cruz who also featured on the Stryder's last album. The album also features artists affiliated with Roc Nation: Canadian singer Melanie Fiona on \\"Let It Rain\\", American singer Alexis Jordan, and American singer Bridget Kelly on \\"Take The World\\". The song \\"Game Over\\" features six different artists. Eric Turner from the Swedish rock band Street Fighting Man also features on the album. = 2011‚Äì14: Non-album singles= The first single from the scrapped studio album entitled Full Tank is \\"Spaceship\\" and it features English singer and songwriter Dappy from N-Dubz. Stryder performed at the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final in support of the single, making him the first rapper in history to perform at a UEFA Champions League final. He teamed up with Scottish DJs and record producers Calvin Harris and Matt Burns, credited as 'BURNS', for the second single from the scrapped album, \\"Off the Record\\". On 3 November 2011 Stryder announced in an interview that his fourth album would be entitled; \\"Full Tank\\". On 3 January 2012 Stryder released the video for the third single from Full Tank entitled \\"Bright Lights\\" which features English singer Pixie Lott. There is also another version of the song entitled 'Bright Lights Part II' that is featured on Pixie Lott's second studio album, Young Foolish Happy. In various media outlets in July 2012, Stryder spoke of the single \\"Help Me\\" being released in September 2012. The video of the single was released on 15 August 2012, featuring singer and songwriter Camille Purcell. It has been described as \\"unmistakably Tinchy\\" and \\"among his better work\\". On 25 December 2012, on his Facebook page, Stryder released a freestyle titled \\"Look At Me Now\\" along with it he said \\"Look out for the first single from my fourth album early next year. Can't wait to share this new music with you all!\\". This being said means \\"Spaceship\\", \\"Off the Record\\", \\"Bright Lights\\" and \\"Help Me\\" became non-album singles. = 2014‚Äìpresent: The Cloud 9 LP / 360¬∞ = Four years after his last album, Stryder released a promotional single, \\"Misunderstood\\", on 14 April 2014. It was slated to feature on his forthcoming fourth album, but didn't make the final cut. \\"ESG\\", the album's lead single, was released on 9 June 2014. It features vocals from Takura and production by Show N Prove. Along with the release of the single, Tinchy announced that the new album would be titled 360¬∞. In October 2014, Stryder paired up with the Chuckle Brothers to release a charity single \\"To Me, To You (Bruv)\\" to raise money for the African- Caribbean Leukaemia Trust. Stryder participated in the fourteenth series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, having been chosen by the public to complete one trial. He left on day 21. On 26 April 2015, Tinchy released a new non-album single, \\"Imperfection\\", featuring vocals from Fuse ODG. Despite being playlisted by numerous UK radio stations, the song failed to enter the UK Singles Chart. On 8 May and 16 May 2015 respectively, Tinchy released \\"Six Four Stuff\\" and \\"Blurt\\" (featuring K2 World) for free download via SoundCloud. With the two grime singles, he announced that the new album was to be titled The Cloud 9 LP. On 23 August 2015, Tinchy released a video for a new song, \\"Sekky\\", which features vocals from fellow Ruff Sqwad member Roachee and production from Sir Spyro and Rude Kid. This was the second song from the album to be premiered. On 3 March 2016, Tinchy announced that The Cloud 9 LP / 360¬∞ will be released as a fourteen-track double album on 8 April 2016. This announcement was accompanied by the release of \\"Allow Me\\" (featuring Jme) as an \\"instant grat\\" single; those who pre-order the new album can instantly download the new single. Business ventures and endorsements In September 2006, Stryder created the clothing brand Star in the Hood, named after his pseudonym \\"Star In The Hood\\". In June 2010, he aligned Takeover Entertainment Limited, with entertainment powerhouses Roc Nation LLC and Live Nation, and created Takeover Roc Nation. The joint venture ended in 2013 but he remains close to Roc Nation. In December 2008, Stryder created his own global publishing company, Takeover/Cloud 9 by a joint venture with EMI division EMI Music Publishing. On 8 November 2011, Honda's motorbike division hired Stryder for their pan-European campaign. The campaign featuring Stryder was supported by Facebook, Inc., and a tie-up with fashion brand GAS in order to push the Vision 50, Honda's 50cc entry level scooter. The Vision 50 was launched on 8 November 2011 at the EICMA (Milan Motorcycle Show) in Milan, Italy along with six other bike models. In June 2012, Danquah released a line of consumer electronics. The Goji Electronics line consists of the brand of headphones, Goji Tinchy Stryder, the Goji On Cloud 9 Audio equipment, a circumaural headphone, an on-ear headphone, an in-ear headphone, a series of HD over-ear headphones, a supra-aural headphone, travel speakers, also consumer electronics such as tablet computer, netbook and smartphone accessories.

This interpretation had been proposed in conceptual terms in 1927 by Louis de Broglie, was independently re-discovered by David Bohm who brought it to a complete and systematic form in 1952, and was expanded on by Bohm and Hiley. Emphasizing de Broglie's contribution, Valentini has consistently referred to the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics underlying his work as the \\"de Broglie‚ÄìBohm theory\\". = Quantum equilibrium, locality and uncertainty = In 1991, Valentini provided indications for deriving the quantum equilibrium hypothesis which states that \\\\rho(x,y,z,t)=\\\\psi(x,y,z,t)^2 in the frame work of the pilot wave theory. Valentini showed that the relaxation \\\\rho(x,y,z,t) ‚Üí \\\\psi(x,y,z,t)^2 may be accounted for by a H-theorem constructed in analogy to the Boltzmann H-theorem of statistical mechanics.

Cushing: Quantum mechanics: historical contingency and the Copenhagen hegemony, The University of Chicago Press, 1994, , p. 270 = Background and implications = Valentini has been described as an \\"ardent admirer of de Broglie\\". He noted that \\"de Broglie (rather like Maxwell) emphasized an underlying 'mechanical' picture: particles were assumed to be singularities of physical waves in space\\".Antony Valentini: Pilot-wave theory of fields, gravitation and cosmology, in: James T. Cushing, Arthur Fine, Sheldon Goldstein (eds.): Bohmian mechanics and quantum theory: an appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, p. 45‚Äì66, p. 47. He emphasized that de Broglie, with the assistance of Erwin Schr√∂dinger, had constructed pilot wave theory, but later abandoned it in favor of quantum formalism. Valentini's derivation of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis was criticized by Detlef D√ºrr and co-workers in 1992, and the derivation of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis has remained a topic of active investigation.Peter J. Riggs: Quantum Causality: Conceptual Issues in the Causal Theory of Quantum Mechanics, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 23, Springer, 2009, , , p. 76 \\"Signal nonlocality\\", which is forbidden in orthodox quantum theory, would allow nonlocal quantum entanglement to be used as a stand-alone communication channel without the need of a classical light-speed limited retarded signal to unlock the entangled message from the sender to the receiver.

Originally produced by Borland Software Corporation, Embarcadero Delphi is composed of an IDE, set of standard libraries, and a Pascal-based language commonly called either Object Pascal, Delphi Pascal, or simply 'Delphi' (Embarcadero's current documentation refers to it as 'the Delphi language (Object Pascal)'http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/XE2/en/Delphi_Reference). Since first released, it has become the most popular commercial Pascal implementation. While developing Pascal, Wirth employed a bootstrapping procedure in which each newer version of the Pascal compiler was written and compiled with its predecessor. Thus, the 'P2' compiler was written in the dialect compilable by 'P1', 'P3' in turn was written in 'P2' and so on, all the way till 'P5'. The 'P5' compiler implemented Pascal in its final state as defined by Wirth, and subsequently became standardised as 'ISO 7185 Pascal'. The Borland dialect, like the popular UCSD Pascal before it, took the 'P4' version of the language as its basis, rather than Wirth's final revision. After much evolution independent of Standard Pascal, the Borland variant became the basis for Delphi. This page goes over the differences between Delphi and Standard Pascal. It does not go into Delphi-specific extensions to the language, which are numerous and still increasing.  Differences between Standard Pascal and Delphi  1\\\\. The way procedures and functions can be passed as parameters differs: Delphi requires explicit procedural types to be declared where Standard Pascal does not. 2\\\\. Delphi does not support so called 'extraprocedural gotos', in which goto statements may reference targets outside the current procedure/function body. 3\\\\. Standard Pascal has file 'buffer variables', together with 'get' and 'put' standard procedures that operate on them. Neither are supported in Delphi. 4\\\\. Given a variant record in Standard Pascal, the size of a particular variant can be specified. Delphi does not support this form of 'sized' dynamic variable allocation: new(p, t) //where t is a variant record tag type; does not compile in Delphi 5\\\\. The functions 'pack' and 'unpack' are not implemented in Delphi. 6\\\\. The Delphi compiler does not treat { and (*, } and *) as synonyms like Standard Pascal requires. In other words, { comment *) is not valid in Delphi. Instead, Delphi uses the scheme of allowing the different comment types to indicate nested comments. 7\\\\. Delphi does not replace eoln with space as the Pascal standard requires. When reading through the end of a line, the eoln character is supposed to be replaced with a space in ISO 7185. Instead, reading through eoln in Delphi gives the character code for carriage return (13), followed by line feed (10). 8\\\\. Numbers and booleans are not printed out in their 'default' field widths by Delphi's version of the Write and WriteLn standard procedures, being instead printed in the minimum amount of space. For example, in Delphi, write(5); write(55); is equivalent to: write(5:1); write(55:2); However, Standard Pascal requires it to be equivalent to the following (TotalWidth is implementation-defined): write(5:TotalWidth); write(55:TotalWidth); Similarly, for booleans, write(false); write(true); is equivalent to write('false':5); write('true':4); in Delphi, but write('false':TotalWidth); write('true':TotalWidth); in ISO 7185. 9\\\\. Temporary files are not supported by Delphi using traditional Pascal I/O - executing Reset() or Rewrite() results in an error, where under Standard Pascal it opens a temporary file that exists for the duration of the program before being automatically deleted. 10\\\\. Notwithstanding the fact Delphi still allows using much of the traditional Pascal RTL, Delphi-specific library functionality is generally implemented in ordinary Delphi code that uses, rather than adds to, compiler-provided intrinsics. This philosophy contrasts to Standard Pascal, whose RTL must be provided by the compiler. For example, in Standard Pascal, the 'file' type is an intrinsic type - sort of like a record, but another compiler-defined type alongside records. In contrast, the TFileStream class in Delphi is an ordinary Delphi class written in ordinary Delphi code. Similarly, the Read, ReadLn, Write and WriteLn standard procedures have signatures that are not themselves legal Pascal signatures. While Delphi still implements them, only vary rarely do Delphi-specific RTL routines require similarly special handling: rather, the language was evolved to include features such as 'open arrays', default parameters and procedural overloading that can be used by user-written routines too.

It includes optimizing C, C++, and Fortran compilers, libraries, and performance analysis and debugging tools, for Solaris on SPARC and x86 platforms, and Linux on x86/x64 platforms, including multi-core systems. Oracle Developer Studio is downloadable and usable at no charge; however, there are many security and functionality patch updates which are only available with a support contract from Oracle. Version 12.4 adds partial support for the C++11 language standard. All C++11 features are supported except for concurrency and atomic operations, and user-defined literals. Version 12.6 supports the C++14 language standard. Languages * C * C++ * Fortran Supported architectures * SPARC * i86pc (x86 and x86-64)  Components  The Oracle Developer software suite includes: * C, C++, and Fortran compilers and support libraries * dbx and frontends * lint * A NetBeans-based IDE * Performance Analyzer * Thread analyzer * Sun performance library * Distributed make  Compiler optimizations  A common optimizing backend is used for code generation. A high-level intermediate representation called Sun IR is used, and high-level optimizations done in the iropt (intermediate representation optimizer) component are operated at the Sun IR level. Major optimizations include: * Copy propagation * Constant folding and constant propagation * Dead code elimination * Interprocedural optimization analysis * Loop optimizations * Automatic parallelization * Profile-guided optimization * Scalar replacement * Strength reduction * Automatic vectorization, with \`-xvector=simd\` OpenMP The OpenMP shared memory parallelization API is native to all three compilers. Code coverage Tcov, a source code coverage analysis and statement-by-statement profiling tool, comes as a standard utility. Tcov generates exact counts of the number of times each statement in a program is executed and annotates source code to add instrumentation. The tcov utility gives information on how often a program executes segments of code. It produces a copy of the source file, annotated with execution frequencies. The code can be annotated at the basic block level or the source line level. As the statements in a basic block are executed the same number of times, a count of basic block executions equals the number of times each statement in the block is executed. The tcov utility does not produce any time-based data. GCCFSS The GCC for SPARC Systems (GCCFSS) compiler uses GNU Compiler Collection's (GCC) front end with the Oracle Developer Studio compiler's code-generating back end. Thus, GCCFSS is able to handle GCC-specific compiler directives, while it is also able to take advantage of the compiler optimizations in the compiler's back end. This greatly facilitates the porting of GCC-based applications to SPARC systems. GCCFSS 4.2 adds the ability to be used as a cross compiler; SPARC binaries can be generated on an x86 (or x64) machine running Solaris. Research platform Before its cancellation, the Rock would have been the first general-purpose processor to support hardware transactional memory (HTM). The Oracle Developer Studio compiler is used by a number of research projects, including Hybrid Transactional Memory (HyTM) and Phased Transactional Memory (PhTM), to investigate support and possible HTM optimizations.

It is one of the oldest grammar schools in the region and is rich in traditions. The school was founded in 1831 and was named after the famous native of Szolnok, Ferenc Verseghy in 1922. At present (2011) 552 pupils attending 17 classes are taught by 46 teachers.  History  Upon the request of the citizens of Szolnok, Francis I, King of Hungary endorsed the establishment of a grammar school in 1831. It was provisionally run on the premises of a Franciscan monastery until 1835, when it was given its own building. Despite its promising development, the school was forced to close down for financial reasons between 1852 and 1862. When it was nationalised in 1887, the construction of a new building was also seen to, which was eventually finished in 1892. The Eclectic edifice was erected at the most beautiful place in town, where the house of birth of Verseghy Ferenc, the renowned linguist and poet once stood. Instruction began in the new, but only partially finished building in September 1888. The grammar school was named after Verseghy Ferenc at the centenary of his death, 1922. It continued to develop in the 1930s, playing an important role in the cultural life of the town. It was then that its students first started achieving outstanding results at national academic competitions. However, instruction had to be suspended due to the Second World War as the building was put into the service of the Germans, and later the Red Army. The school assumed the name of Nikos Beloyannis in 1952, but the politically motivated name change was short-lived, and the school regained its former name in 1955. The most populous year in the school‚Äôs history was 1970, with 700 pupils attending the classes of 36 teachers. By then, excellent results of Verseghy students at national competitions were fairly customary. In 1981, the building underwent a comprehensive reconstruction, the works being finished off by the building of a modern, well-equipped gymnasium in 1986. The school building was further expanded in 1995, providing the canteen and computer rooms with suitable housing. =Coat of arms= The current coat of arms was designed in 1932 and was in use between 1932 and 1945. Political changes necessitated a change in the design, but in 1990 the former coat of arms was reinstated and has been in use since. The coat of arms is made up of a dark blue shield with three broadswords in the middle to symbolise the three main objectives of education, namely science, arts and moral. Above the shield the Hungarian Holy Crown can be seen. The inscription on the shield reads Verseghy Ferenc Gimn√°zium Szolnok.

The church was founded in the late 19th century, and prospered during the colonial and post- colonial periods. It was the centre for the Scottish community in Colombo. The first Presbyterian church in Ceylon, St. Andrew's Church, was built on Prince Street, Pettah (now known as Sir Baron Jayathilaka Mawatha). The foundation stone was laid on 26 February 1841 by the then Governor James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie and the first church service was held on 21 August 1842. The inaugural pastor, Rev. Joseph Marsh, was also the first colonial chaplain of Ceylon. Towards the end of the 19th century many of the church's congregation left the country and returned to Scotland. As the congregation diminished and the Colombo fort area became more commercialised, a decision was made to relocate the church to a site in Colpetty. The church's chaplain, Rev. Alexander Dunn, oversaw the acquisition of the site and the construction of the new church. The former church was demolished and the land sold to fund the new church (the former location is now the site of the Whiteaway, Laidlaw & Co. Building). The foundation stone was laid by Governor Sir Henry Arthur Blake on 16 August 1906.The church was designed by Edward Skinner, a Scottish born architect, and constructed by Walker Sons and Company. The sanctuary was built in a year and the church retained the name and emphasised the Scottish tradition by adding the phrase 'Kirk' which means church. The exterior structure of the church is constructed of wood and stone and the tiled floor of the church is shaped like a cross. The church pews are made of teak. The stained glass in the church's windows arrived by steam ship from England in 1921. The main chancel window reflects the Crucifixion, the window behind the altar has images of Saint Paul, holding a bible and a sword and Saint Andrew. The south transept window contains images of Saint Sebastian and Saint Martin, and is dedicated to the troops of World War I. The west window, displaying the Ascension of Christ and is dedicated to Rev. Alexander Dunn. The church is one of the few churches in the country that still has an operating pipe organ. In keeping with presbyterian traditions there is no altar in the church, instead there is a communion table. There are a number of marble memorial plaques on the walls, including a plaque in memory of the co-editor of The Ceylon Observer, Donald S. Ferguson, who passed away in Scotland in 1911. Another plaque is to James Curtis, the church's building supervisor, who died at sea in 1911. Adjoining the church is a two-storey manse built in 1907, where the church's pastor resides. In 1948, Sri Lanka received its independence from the British rule and in the following decades, most of the British and Scottish community in the country returned home to the United Kingdom, which drastically reduced the church's traditional European congregation. Realising the need for change, St Andrew‚Äôs moved from being predominantly European Presbyterian church to an international and interdenominational church. In the late 1960s, the Rev. Andrew Baillie, was instrumental in opening the doors of the church to the locals. The congregation is now a mixture of Sri Lankans, expatriates and international visitors, and maintains an English-speaking Protestant form of worship and a keen interest in Christian social service in the midst of a largely non-Christian society. It maintained the label \\"Presbyterian\\" during a long period of independence, the former Presbytery of Ceylon having dissolved decades ago, but it is now associated with the International Presbytery in the Church of Scotland. It is one of only three churches outside Europe administered by the International Presbytery.

He was the only Arab foreign minister of an independent Zanzibar before the establishment of the People's Republic of Zanzibar. When his government was overthrown in January 1964 Barwani was held in detention centers across Tanzania until his release in 1974, when he fled to Kenya as a refugee. After obtaining refugee status, Barwani moved to Cairo then back to Kenya then to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. In the UAE, Barwani translated the Qur'an into Swahili languageSwahili (Swahili kiUnguja) Qur'ani Tukufu for which he is most prominently known. During the years of the Al Said dynasty based in Zanzibar the Barwani were involved in the development of the east African coast from Barawa (in the north, in what was to become Italian Somaliland) to Lindi, in the south, a town founded by Sheikh Ali's maternal grandfather (in what was to become German East Africa). His maternal grandmother was related to the wa Mtwapa, one of the twelve miji (or taifa 'groups') comprising Swahili Mombasa. Ali was an outstanding student and in 1937, aged eighteen, he passed effortlessly from government secondary school in Zanzibar to university at Makerere in Kampala. His admission was unusual in that he gained university entrance on the strength of a phone-call from his headmaster (L.W. Hollingsworth) to the Director of Education, Zanzibar - no examination required ! At Makerere, then the only institution for higher learning in East Africa, Ali read agriculture. A fellow student at that time was Julius Nyerere who, as President of Tanganyika, was to play a significant role in Sheikh Ali's life some 20 years later. In 1942, on his return to Zanzibar, he was employed by the Protectorate government as an assistant agricultural officer at Mangapwani. Two years later he married Bi. Azza binti Muhammad Seif Al-Busa'idi ‚Äì marriage made in heaven it would seem. After the second World War (1939-1945) Ali developed a taste for politics which manifested itself in two ways. First, for some fifteen years, he edited the newspaper Mwongozi and, secondly, he joined the Zanzibar Nationalist Party. One of Ali's ambitions was to transform Zanzibar into a non-racial society and, to this end, he promoted the implementation of a common electoral roll. After the Zanzibar Sultanate attained internal self-government in 1961 Sheikh Ali was appointed Minister of Education. In this post he ensured that married female teachers were eligible for maternity leave and maternity pay - his innovation being soon adopted by other ministries. Subsequent cabinet posts were Minister of the Interior and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Commerce. In March and April 1962 Sheikh Ali visited London for the Kenya coastal Strip (the Kenya Protectorate) conference at Lancaster House, which closed without any firm decision being taken on the integration of the coastal strip (Mwambao) with the rest of Kenya. Sheikh Ali attended as one of eight elected members from Zanzibar. On 12 January 1964 a revolution brought the Al Said dynasty in Zanzibar (established in the 1830s) to a bloody and sudden end Sheikh Ali (with others) was detained for six months at Kilimani, Zanzibar Stone Town, before being flown to the mainland. Here his detention continued at Keko, Ukonga Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Mwanza and Bukoba for a period of ten years and four months, but he was never charged with any offence. In May 1974 he was released, but his application for a Tanzanian passport was refused. Sheikh Ali then determined to enter neighbouring Kenya illicitly. His point of entry was Vanga, and thence he traveled to Nairobi via Mombasa where he applied for and obtained refugee status. He was fated never to see Zanzibar again. Perhaps the authorities in both revolutionary Zanzibar and in Tanganyika (subsequently the United Republic of Tanzania) saw in Sheikh Ali's intellect and ability a potential threat to their leadership. Whether this was so or not it is now idle to speculate. Once his papers were in order Sheikh Ali traveled to Cairo. After a stay of several years he returned to Kenya, this time lawfully. For a while he lived in Ganjoni, Mombasa, and then at Mtongwe. From there Sheikh Ali and his family moved to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. Here, in 1989 his beloved companion for life died, after almost half a century of marriage. It was the cruelest of blows. At about this time began the affliction of failing eyesight. Notwithstanding, Sheikh Ali was able to complete and publish his magnum opus, his interpretation of the Quran into the Swahili of Zanzibar kiUnguja. This monumental work (the first impression appeared in two volumes, 1995; the second in one volume, 2000) owes everything to the Swahili of Sheikh Ali's parents and nothing to the standardized language of Europeans and others. This was truly a labour of love, with beauty and elegance evident in virtually every verse. In 1997 came Ruwaza Njema ('The Perfect Pattern'), a long poem in praise of the Prophet Muhammad, with exemplary annotations at the end of each chapter. The years which remained to him were spent in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman, the birthplace of his wife's parents. Had there been no revolution in Zanzibar and had the Al Said dynasty not been terminated it is conceivable that Sheikh Ali might have attained the highest office in the land, but it was not to be. Sheikh Ali's claim to fame lies rather less in the domain of politics, and rather more in the pages of his Swahili Quran. He was not the first to attempt such a task notable predecessors were Sheikh Amin bin Ali al-Mazrui and Sheikh Abdullah Saleh al- Farsy but it is Sheikh Ali's text which best displays the Swahili language in all its glory. Moreover, it was a task undertaken not lightly, and carried to its conclusion at a time of great personal distress. This, his memorial, will surely endure for as long as the language and the literature of the Swahili- speaking peoples survive. Sheikh Ali died in Muscat on Monday 20 March 2006, in his eighty-sixth year. Education Barwani graduated from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, in 1942.
