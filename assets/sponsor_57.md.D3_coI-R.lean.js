Colonel Sir Henry Ferryman Bowles, 1st Baronet (19 December 1858 ‚Äì 14 October 1943) was a British Army officer and Conservative politician. Early life and family He was the eldest son of Henry Carrington Bowles Bowles of Myddelton House, Bulls Cross, Hertfordshire and Cornelia n√©e Kingdom. He was educated at Harrow School and Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1881 and a master of arts in 1884. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1883. He married Florence \\"Dolly\\" Broughton of Tunstall Hall, Shropshire in 1889. In 1895 he moved to Forty Hall, near Enfield, Middlesex, which his father had purchased in the previous year. His younger brother Gussie was the distinguished horticulturalist E.A. Bowles. Military service Bowles had a long association with the reserve forces of the British Army, holding commissions in the Militia, Volunteer Force and Territorial Force. He was first commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King's Own Tower Hamlets Militia in August 1878, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in September 1880. Under the Childers Reforms, the Tower Hamlets militia became the 7th Battalion of the Rifle Brigade in 1881. Bowles was promoted to captain in February 1882. He eventually rose to the rank of major and honorary lieutenant colonel of the battalion. In May 1899 he transferred to the 1st Volunteer Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. When the volunteers were reorganised as the Territorial Force in 1908, Bowles was appointed honorary colonel of the successor 7th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. During the First World War he was appointed county commandant for volunteer units in Middlesex, and retired at the end of the conflict with rank of colonel. Local and parliamentary politics A Conservative in politics, Bowles was one of the original members of the Middlesex County Council, elected to represent Enfield West in 1889. After 20 years as a councillor he was elevated to the position of county alderman in 1909. He retired from the council in 1936, following 47 years of membership. In March 1889 the sitting Conservative MP for Enfield, Viscount Folkestone, was elevated to the peerage on the death of his father, the Earl of Radnor. Bowles was unanimously chosen by local Conservative and Unionist Association to defend the seat. The main issue in the by-election campaign was Irish Home Rule, and Bowles managed to defeat his Liberal Party opponent by a little over 1,500 votes. He was re-elected at the general elections of 1892, 1895 (unopposed) and 1900. At the 1906 general election there was a large swing to the Liberals, and Bowles was defeated by James Branch. Twelve years later Bowles returned to parliament at the 1918 general election, when he was elected as the Coalition Conservative MP for the redrawn Enfield constituency.Parliamentary boundaries had been changed by the Representation of the People Act 1918. The sitting MP for Enfield, John Pretyman Newman, stood at the new Finchley seat. He retired from parliament at the next general election in 1922. Other interests He was a justice of the peace for Middlesex for over 50 years, and chairman of the Edmonton Petty Sessional Division for 21 years. He was appointed High Sheriff of Middlesex for 1928. In 1936 he retired from the bench. Bowles was an early motoring enthusiast, and was the first president of the Middlesex County Automobile Club retaining the position from 1905 until his death. He was a long serving member of the Court of the Goldsmiths' Company. Baronetcy and family In July 1926 he was created a baronet, \\"of Enfield in the County of Middlesex\\" for public and political services. He suffered a stroke on 13 October 1943, and died on the following day at Enfield War Memorial Hospital aged 84. His daughter, Wilma Mary Garnault Bowles (d. 1928), married Eustace Parker in 1913.The Peerage In 1920 Eustace changed his name to Bowles by Royal Licence and his grandson is Andrew Parker Bowles, former husband of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.Armorial Families, Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, 1929, p. 199 Sir Henry's wife had predeceased him in 1935, and the baronetcy became extinct upon his death.

He has also produced for artists such as Rihanna, Kelly Clarkson, SoMo, Jenna Andrews, and Jessie James.  Early life  Schultz was born on March 30, 1989, in St. Louis, Missouri. He is the only child of Steve Schultz and Lynn Schultz. Schultz, a classically trained pianist, showed musical abilities at a very young age and began deejaying local parties at the age of 10. He went on to produce for local acts in and around St. Louis before completing high school. After graduating from Parkway Central High School in 2007, Schultz enrolled in Columbia College, a performing arts school in Chicago, Illinois. Following a chance meeting with fellow student, and then unknown, Jeremih, he began his career in the music industry.  Career  Schultz and Jeremih wrote and recorded one song together shortly after meeting in 2008. Schultz immediately began walking the music in to local radio, where he met his manager, Luis Duran. Encouraged by positive response, the duo immediately set out to compile what would become Jeremih‚Äôs debut album. In late 2008, Schultz went on to launch his own production company, Mick Schultz Productions, to which he immediately signed Jeremih as his first artist. After receiving a tremendous amount of airplay on their song \\"Birthday Sex\\", offers started coming in from all the major record labels. Jeremih was promptly signed to Def Jam Records. In 2009, Schultz was signed to a publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing. In 2010, Schultz and Jeremih teamed up again to produce the artist‚Äôs sophomore release, All About You. As with Jeremih‚Äôs debut album, Schultz is once again the sole producer on the album, which features such hits as \\"I Like\\" featuring Ludacris and \\"Down on Me\\" featuring 50 Cent. Schultz continues to produce and write for various artists. In early 2013, Schultz collaborated with Zendaya to co-produce her debut single \\"Replay\\" off her self-titled album. The song reached #40 in the Billboard Hot 100. Schultz also produced an album for Republic Records artist SoMo in mid-2013. They recorded the album in Schultz's Malibu studio. The self-titled album was released on April 8, 2014 through Universal Republic. In mid-2014, Schultz co-produced the double platinum selling single \\"Don't Tell 'Em\\" by Jeremih featuring YG. Schultz produced Rihanna's \\"Desperado\\" off her 2016 album entitled ANTI. He received a Grammy nomination for his work. In 2018 Schultz received another Grammy Nomination for his work on Kelly Clarkson's album entitled Meaning Of Life in which he produced songs Heat & Medicine.

Until the time it was removed from service, it was the oldest courthouse still in use in Georgia. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History Old and new pictures of the courthouse taken from various sources, seen at the Old Knoxville Days on May 19, 2012. The new courthouse. In an act of December 23, 1822, the legislature authorized Crawford County's initial inferior court to select a site to serve as county seat and provide for construction of a courthouse with a provision that such site \\"be as near the center of the county as convenience will admit.\\" (Ga. Laws 1822, p. 23) The same act provided that until a courthouse could be built, Crawford County courts and elections would be held at the home of Imlay Vansciver. In December 1823, the legislature designated Knoxville as the county seat. At some point thereafter, Crawford County's first courthouse was built. That structure burned down in 1829 or 1830. The following year, construction of a new courthouse began. The new building was completed in January 1832. Since then, there have been numerous repairs and remodeling, with extensive interior renovations and construction of a small addition in the late 1960s. Around 1890, a new railroad was built through the middle of Crawford County following a north-south route. For whatever reason, the railroad's path came near to, but skipped, the county seat of Knoxville. The historic structure is now the home of the Crawford County Historical Society. =A new courthouse= In 2001-02, a new courthouse was built one block behind the old courthouse, as the previous structure was built long before elevators were invented for the disabled. The new courthouse has a clock tower on top of it, which sunk into the roof shortly after completion, causing major damage. It has since been repaired, although some residents of Knoxville remain wary of it. Today Today the courthouse serves as a museum, and is also home to the Crawford County Historical Society. The flag that flies outside of the courthouse is derived from the Lone star flag, the state flag of Texas.

Later they were adapted for land service during World War I and World War II. Description The 17 cm SK L/40 gun although designated as , its actual caliber was . It used the Krupp horizontal sliding-block, or \\"wedge\\", as it is sometimes referred to, in a breech loading design, rather than the interrupted screw commonly used in the heavy guns of other nations. This required that the propellant charge be loaded in a metal, (usually brass), case which provides obturation, i.e. seals the breech to prevent escape of the expanding propellant gas. = Naval Use = The Braunschweig-class secondary battery consisted of fourteen 17 cm SK L/40 quick-firing guns, four of which were mounted in single turrets amidships, with the remaining ten in casemates around the superstructure. These guns had a total of 1,820 shells, for 130 rounds per gun and a rate of fire of approximately 6 per minute. To transit the Kiel Canal, the three central casemated guns had to be withdrawn into their housings, as they were unable to train fully flush with the sides of the ships. With the guns fully emplaced, the ships would have been too wide to fit in the canal. The Deutschland-class secondary battery consisted of fourteen 17 cm SK L/40 quick- firing guns mounted in casemates amidships. Five were emplaced in the top deck and two one deck higher in the superstructure on either side. These guns had a total of 1,820 shells, for 130 rounds per gun and a rate of fire of approximately 6 per minute. The guns had an arc of train of 160¬∞.

The guns were adapted for land use by mounting it on an improvised carriage, but this proved to be extremely heavy, often too heavy to be moved by horse, even after being broken down into three loads. The solution was to mount the guns, still on their carriages, on rail cars to increase their strategic mobility. = World War I Railway Gun = left A number of guns were used as railway guns during World War I. = World War II Railway Gun = Six guns were used as railway guns from 1938 onwards.

The song appeared on Cheap Trick's 1979 album Dream Police. A live version was included on the 1978 album Cheap Trick at Budokan, which initially appeared only in Japan but eventually was in the United States in early 1979. Because Cheap Trick was immensely popular in Japan, the band's Japanese label demanded that At Budokan include three new songs. The three songs were \\"Ain't That a Shame\\", \\"Goodnight Now\\", and \\"Need Your Love.\\" The song uses a traditional hard rock formula, and does not use synthesized strings as were used on other songs on Dream Police. The musical backing to the song on Dream Police is basically a mid-tempo jam consisting of Nielsen's fancy guitar playing and Petersson's driving bass. Singer Robin Zander sings in a falsetto voice and incorporates a tremolo warble at the end of each line. Nielsen has commented that \\"I think it is a desperate type of tune that Robin does a great job of singing.\\" This arrangement is put through several changes, incorporating a heavy guitar break, which stretches the length of the song more than seven and a half minutes. Ira Robbins of Trouser Press notes that the song \\"starts out slow and restrained, but builds to an intense boogie-based climax.\\" Ultimate Classic Rock critic Dave Swanson describes \\"Need Your Love\\" as \\"a slow-building groove [which] builds into a full-on monster as big chords, big vocals, powerhouse bass and absolutely rock-solid drumming come together to make for a song that still sends chills. He also praises the way the band provides weight, particularly Zander's vocals and Nielsen's guitars, describing the song as sounding like \\"the Beatles' 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)' as played by the Yardbirds.\\" Music critic Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone described the song as \\"a better version of the Who meets Free than Bad Company has ever managed ‚Äî but that's about all it is.\\" Mojo noted that \\"Need Your Love\\" and \\"Gonna Raise Hell\\", another song from Dream Police, \\"proved the Trick could do heavy, freaky rock jams as well as any of their peers.\\" Brett Milano of udiscovermusic.com rated Nielson's guitar solo as one of the 100 all-time greatest. The instrumental segments lift bits from \\"Emergency\\" off 1 , \\"T.N.T.\\", and \\"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\\" while the lyrics quote \\"Eight Days a Week\\", \\"5:15\\" and \\"Long Time Gone\\" by the Everly Brothers. The live version of the song on Cheap Trick at Budokan is similar to the version on Dream Police. It begins with Zander proclaiming \\"I need your love\\" to the screaming female fans. This is followed by Bun E. Carlos' pounding drumming that leads into Nielsen's and Petersson's guitar and bass work. The song builds to a steady climax and then transforms itself into a supercharged boogie. Carlos has stated that the band originally learned the song for their 1978 album Heaven Tonight but it was only when producer Tom Werman heard the band play live that he realized how good the song was and regretted excluding it from the earlier album. Subsequent to its initial releases, the song was released on Cheap Trick compilation albums Hits of Cheap Trick, The Music of Cheap Trick and Setlist: The Very Best of Cheap Trick Live. \\"Need Your Love\\" has been covered by several other artists, including Tony Rebel and Shadow Reef.

It was first developed by Jonah Peretti at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center's R&D; program under the project 'Reblog' (from where the term originates) as an open-source tool for individually-run blogs. Tumblr then built it into their social network for re- sharing posts within the network, and similar features (\\"Retweet\\" on Twitter, \\"Share\\" on Facebook) then followed. For a number of microblogging and social networking services, reblogging has become a means of both social bookmarking and user commentary; unlike social news services like Digg, Slashdot, and Reddit, however, reblogging typically does not involve a centralized \\"front page\\" to which the highest-ranked post is appended. Reblogging (and the increased attention paid to the indexing and encouragement of reblogging) has become a major feature of many social networking sites and content-hosting services, and it has also become a potent means of secondary content promotion and audience measurement whereby links to external content are syndicated across multiple profiles and the reposts are indexed as a measurement of currency and relevance. History and comparison A historical precedent to reblogging is the viral nature of e-mail, as \\"Internet petitions\\" and \\"chain e-mails\\" which encouraged e-mail users to \\"resend\\" the e-mail to at least a minimum number of contacts on one's contact list were highly popular (and highly controversial) in the 1980s and 1990s. With the rise of the World Wide Web, it was not uncommon for webmasters, including major news service websites, to encourage readers of a post to share a link to the post with others on one's contact list. Only in the mid-2000s was the \\"share via e-mail\\" solicitation accompanied or replaced by branded \\"sharing\\" buttons from various social news or bookmarking services at the time, giving bloggers and news services a seemingly more accurate metric for readership and traffic than ever before; the issue of user moderation, however, gave bloggers and news services pause due to both real and alleged competition in moderation ranking of shared \\"front-page\\" posts. With the rise of micro-blogging in the latter 2000s, however, user moderation on front pages was de-emphasized as a feature in favor of \\"reblogs\\" on user profiles, which were usually taken by bloggers and news services as automatic endorsement of an original/linked post's currency, if not popular favor. =Reblog= Reblog was an open-source tool made at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center's R&D; program, a team led by Jonah Peretti along with Michael Frumin, Michael Migurski, Alexander R. Galloway and Boris Anthony. 'Reblog' was an open-source tool for individually-run blogs, with many early new media artists and bloggers using the tool to share content from one blog on another. =Tumblr= In 2007, Tumblr, a blogging service and network, launched. It is profile-driven and hierarchical in its facilitation of \\"reblogs\\". An original post by one Tumblr user is reblogged by another user by embedding a quote of the original post, link and publishing username in the repost, with the option of making a comment in reply to the previous post. A feature of this method that distinguishes Tumblr from Twitter is that less emphasis is placed upon reblogging only the original post, resulting in often highly stacked semi-threaded conversations which are indexed and interpreted by the Tumblr server in the presented manner. While Twitter's character limit allows for little to no personal response, a Tumblr reblog allows for an endless amount of interpretations of the subject matter. As a result, posts to Tumblr are typically shown less as typical blog posts (as offered by most major blog providers) and more as a blend of both Internet forum and blog features. Another difference between the two platforms is that Tumblr reblogs are more often visual, while Twitter is more message-based. =Twitter= On Twitter, another micro-blogging service, the \\"retweet\\" phenomenon began in March 2007, whereby an informal protocol slowly developed among Twitter users. Initially called an \\"echo\\" the first instance was by Narendra Rocherolle. A month later the term \\"retweet\\" was first referenced. In this protocol, a post by User A which was considered notable by another Twitter user, User B, was copied by User B and reposted under User B's account and prefixed with \\"RT @username\\", with \\"RT\\" meaning \\"retweet\\". The at sign had been previously developed as a means of replying to Twitter posts, while the hashtag protocol would later be developed by users within the same year to highlight important keywords which they wished to be indexed in a search engine. In 2009, the \\"retweet\\" phenomenon would experience a major uptick in adoption by Twitter users in order to forward SMS posts by Iranian observers and participants in the events following the Iranian presidential election. In August 2009, Twitter officially began integrating the \\"retweet\\" mechanism by replacing the string \\"RT @username\\" with a retweet symbol emulating Tumblr's reblog symbol; in addition, retweet buttons were added to all Twitter posts (alongside \\"reply\\") and, by August 2010, an official \\"Tweet button\\" was developed and launched by Twitter for external websites, with Twitter-based application developer Tweetmeme agreeing with Twitter to integrate the functionality of its own then-popular button into Twitter's official button. Tweetmeme, Topsy and a few other external third-party websites provide indexes of currently trending posts, hashtags, users and lists utilizing the Retweet protocol. =Facebook= Facebook, while not promoting itself as a social bookmarking, social news or micro-blogging service, eventually also began allowing users to share links to and comments on external webpages to their walls, and notably to re-share posts from other users' walls with a single click of an attached \\"Share\\" link, \\"reblog-style\\". In addition, buttons for publishers to automatically share their posts on Facebook and index the current number of user links to the linked post are available. Analysis With the growing popularity of reblogging or re-syndication in the latter 2000s and early 2010s, a number of analyses have been offered on the functionality and value of the practice. RT is a popular acronym on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, meaning 'Regards To' and 'Re-Tweet' respectively.

The sunstone () is a type of mineral attested in several 13th‚Äì14th century written sources in Iceland, one of which describes its use to locate the sun in a completely overcast sky. Sunstones are also mentioned in the inventories of several churches and one monastery in 14th‚Äì15th century Iceland and Germany. A theory exists that the sunstone had polarizing attributes and was used as a navigation instrument by seafarers in the Viking Age. A stone found in 2013 off Alderney, in the wreck of a 16th- century warship, may lend evidence of the existence of sunstones as navigational devices. Sources One medieval source in Iceland, \\"Rau√∞√∫lfs √æ√°ttr\\", mentions the sunstone as a mineral by means of which the sun could be located in an overcast and snowy sky by holding it up and noting where it emitted, reflected or transmitted light (hvar geisla√∞i √∫r honum). Sunstones are also mentioned in ' (13th century) and in church and monastic inventories (14th‚Äì15th century) without discussing their attributes. The sunstone texts of Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar were copied to all four versions of the medieval hagiography Gu√∞mundar saga g√≥√∞a. The description in \\"Rau√∞√∫lfs √æ√°ttr\\" of the use of the sunstone is as follows: Allegorical nature of the medieval texts Two of the original medieval texts on the sunstone are allegorical. Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar contains a burst of purely allegorical material associated with Hrafn‚Äôs slaying. This involves a celestial vision with three highly cosmological knights, recalling the horsemen of the Apocalypse. It has been suggested that the horsemen of Hrafns saga contain allegorical allusions to the winter solstice and the four elements as an omen of Hrafn‚Äôs death, where the sunstone also appears. \\"Rau√∞√∫lfs √æ√°ttr\\", a tale of Saint Olav, and the only medieval source mentioning how the sunstone was used, is a thoroughly allegorical work. A round and rotating house visited by Olav has been interpreted as a model of the cosmos and the human soul, as well as a prefiguration of the Church. The intention of the author was to achieve an apotheosis of St. Olav, through placing him in the symbolic seat of Christ. The house belongs to the genre of \\"abodes of the sun,\\" which seemed widespread in medieval literature. St. Olav used the sunstone to confirm the time reckoning skill of his host right after leaving this allegorical house. He held the sunstone up against the snowy and completely overcast sky and noted where light was emitted from it (the Icelandic words used do not make it clear whether the light was reflected by the stone, emitted by it or transmitted through it). It has been suggested that in \\"Rau√∞√∫lfs √æ√°ttr\\" the sunstone was used as a symbol of the Virgin, following a widespread tradition in which the virgin birth of Christ is compared with glass letting a ray of the sun through. The allegories of the above-mentioned texts exploit the symbolic value of the sunstone, but the church and monastic inventories, however, show that something called sunstones did exist as physical objects in Iceland. The presence of the sunstone in \\"Rau√∞√∫lfs √æ√°ttr\\" may be entirely symbolic but its use is described in sufficient detail to show that the idea of using a stone to find the sun's position in overcast conditions was commonplace. Possibility of sunstones for orientation and navigation Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou posited that the \\"sunstone\\" could have been one of the minerals (cordierite or Iceland spar) that polarize light and by which the azimuth of the sun can be determined in a partly overcast sky or when the sun is just below the horizon. The principle is used by many animals; and polar flights applied the idea before more advanced techniques became available. Ramskou further conjectured that Iceland spar could have aided navigation in the open sea in the Viking period. This idea has become very popular, and research as to how a \\"sunstone\\" could be used in nautical navigation continues,Horv√†th, G. et al. (2011). 'On the trail of Vikings with polarized skylight: experimental study of the atmospheric optical prerequisites allowing polarimetric navigation by Viking seafarers' Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2011) 366, 772‚Äì782 often in the context of the Uunartoq disc. Research in 2011 by Ropars et al., confirms that one can identify the direction of the sun to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using Iceland spar and the naked eye. The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye. Alternatively, a dot can be placed on top of the crystal so that when you look at it from below, two dots appear, because the light is ‚Äúdepolarised‚Äù and fractured along different axes. The crystal can then be rotated until the two points have the same luminosity. The angle of the top face now gives the direction of the sun. Attempts to replicate this work in both Scotland and off the coast of Turkey by science journalist Matt Kaplan and mineralogists at the British Geological Survey in 2014 failed. Kaplan communicated extensively with Ropars, and neither could understand why the samples of Iceland spar that were being used during the trials did not reveal the sun's direction. The recovery of a piece of Iceland spar from an Elizabethan ship that sank near Alderney in 1592 suggests the possibility that this navigational technology may have persisted after the invention of the magnetic compass. Although the stone was found near a navigational instrument, its use remains uncertain. Beyond nautical navigation, a polarizing crystal would have been useful as a sundial, especially at high latitudes with extended hours of twilight, in mountainous areas, or in partly overcast conditions. This would have required the polarizing crystal to be used in conjunction with known landmarks. Churches and monasteries would have valued such an object as an aid to keep track of the canonical hours. A Hungarian team proposed that a sun compass artifact with crystals might also have allowed Vikings to guide their boats at night. A type of crystal they called sunstone can use scattered sunlight from below the horizon as a guide. What they suggest is that Iceland spar crystals were used in combination with Haidinger's brush. If so, Vikings could have used them in the northern latitudes where it never becomes completely dark in summer. In areas of confused magnetic deviation (such as the Labrador coast), a sunstone could have been a more reliable guide than a magnetic compass. Josh Gates, in the American reality television series Expedition Unknown (S1:E6), consulted with scholars about the Vikings' use of sunstones and solar compasses for navigation. He then obtains a sunstone from a mine in Norway, and locals (who uphold Viking traditions) build a solar compass for him. Using both the sunstone and the solar compass, he demonstrates how to find North on a cloudy day.

Despite having stopped taking his prescribed medication, Nash continued his studies and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994. His life was depicted in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. The prognosis of schizophrenia is varied at the individual level. In general it has great human and economics costs. It results in a decreased life expectancy of 12‚Äì15 years primarily due to its association with obesity, little exercise, and smoking, while an increased rate of suicide plays a lesser role. These differences in life expectancy have increased between the 1970s and 1990s, and between the 1990s and 2000s has not substantially changed in a health system with open access to care (Finland). Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability. Approximately three quarters of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses. Still some people do recover completely and additional numbers function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42% of cases, an intermediate outcome in 35% of cases, and a poor outcome in 27% of cases. Outcome for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions however have been questioned. There is a higher than average suicide rate associated with schizophrenia. This has been cited at 10%, but a more recent analysis of studies and statistics places the estimate at 4.9%, most often occurring in the period following onset or first hospital admission. Several times more attempt suicide. There are a variety of reasons and risk factors. Course After long-term follow-up half of people with schizophrenia have a favourable outcome while 16% have a delayed recovery after an early unremitting course. More usually, the course in the first two years predicted the long-term course. Early social intervention was also related to a better outcome. The findings were held as important in moving patients, careers and clinicians away from the prevalent belief of the chronic nature of the condition. This outcome on average however is worse than for other psychotic and otherwise psychiatric disorders though a moderate number of people with schizophrenia were seen to remit and remain well, some of these without need for maintenance medication. A clinical study using strict recovery criteria (concurrent remission of positive and negative symptoms and adequate social and vocational functioning continuously for two years) found a recovery rate of 14% within the first five years. A 5-year community study found that 62% showed overall improvement on a composite measure of clinical and functional outcomes. Defining recovery Rates are not always comparable across studies because exact definitions of remission and recovery have not been widely established. A \\"Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group\\" has proposed standardized remission criteria involving \\"improvements in core signs and symptoms to the extent that any remaining symptoms are of such low intensity that they no longer interfere significantly with behavior and are below the threshold typically utilized in justifying an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia\\". Standardized recovery criteria have also been proposed by a number of different researchers, with the stated DSM definitions of a \\"complete return to premorbid levels of functioning‚Äù or \\"complete return to full functioning\\" seen as inadequate, impossible to measure, incompatible with the variability in how society defines normal psychosocial functioning, and contributing to self-fulfilling pessimism and stigma. Some mental health professionals may have quite different basic perceptions and concepts of recovery than individuals with the diagnosis, including those in the Psychiatric survivors movement. One notable limitation of nearly all the research criteria is failure to address the person's own evaluations and feelings about their life. Schizophrenia and recovery often involve a continuing loss of self-esteem, alienation from friends and family, interruption of school and career, and social stigma, \\"experiences that cannot just be reversed or forgotten\\". An increasingly influential model defines recovery as a process, similar to being \\"in recovery\\" from drug and alcohol problems, and emphasizes a personal journey involving factors such as hope, choice, empowerment, social inclusion and achievement. Predictors Several factors have been associated with a better overall prognosis: Being female, rapid (vs. insidious) onset of symptoms, older age of first episode, predominantly positive (rather than negative) symptoms, presence of mood symptoms, and good pre-illness functioning. The strengths and internal resources of the individual concerned, such as determination or psychological resilience, have also been associated with better prognosis. The attitude and level of support from people in the individual's life can have a significant impact; research framed in terms of the negative aspects of this‚Äîthe level of critical comments, hostility, and intrusive or controlling attitudes, termed high 'expressed emotion'‚Äîhas consistently indicated links to relapse. Most research on predictive factors is correlational in nature, however, and a clear cause-and-effect relationship is often difficult to establish. Violence The relationship between violent acts and schizophrenia is a contentious topic. Current research indicates that the percentage of people with schizophrenia who commit violent acts is higher than the percentage of people without any disorder, but lower than is found for disorders such as alcoholism, and the difference is reduced or not found in same-neighbourhood comparisons when related factors are taken into account, notably sociodemographic variables and substance misuse.Violence and schizophrenia:  * Studies have indicated that 5% to 10% of those charged with murder in Western countries have a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The occurrence of psychosis in schizophrenia has sometimes been linked to a higher risk of violent acts. Findings on the specific role of delusions or hallucinations have been inconsistent, but have focused on delusional jealousy, perception of threat and command hallucinations. It has been proposed that a certain type of individual with schizophrenia may be most likely to offend, characterized by a history of educational difficulties, low IQ, conduct disorder, early-onset substance misuse and offending prior to diagnosis. Individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are often the victims of violent crime‚Äîat least 14 times more often than they are perpetrators. Another consistent finding is a link to substance misuse, particularly alcohol, among the minority who commit violent acts. Violence by or against individuals with schizophrenia typically occurs in the context of complex social interactions within a family setting,{subscription required) and is also an issue in clinical services and in the wider community. International Numerous international studies have demonstrated favorable long-term outcomes for around half of those diagnosed with schizophrenia, with substantial variation between individuals and regions. One retrospective study found that about a third of people made a full recovery, about a third showed improvement but not a full recovery, and a third remained ill. A clinical study using strict recovery criteria (concurrent remission of positive and negative symptoms and adequate social and vocational functioning continuously for two years) found a recovery rate of 14% within the first five years. A 5-year community study found that 62% showed overall improvement on a composite measure of symptomatic, clinical and functional outcomes. Rates are not always comparable across studies because an exact definition of what constitutes recovery has not been widely accepted, although standardized criteria have been suggested. The World Health Organization conducted two long-term follow-up studies involving more than 2,000 people suffering from schizophrenia in different countries. These studies found patients have much better long-term outcomes in developing countries (India, Colombia and Nigeria) than in developed countries (USA, UK, Ireland, Denmark, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Japan, and Russia), despite the fact that antipsychotic drugs are typically not widely available in poorer countries, raising questions about the effectiveness of such drug-based treatments. On its face, psychiatric medication itself may be causing the worse Western-society outcomes. Large-scale, randomized, blinded studies of alternatives are warranted. In many non-Western societies, schizophrenia may only be treated with more informal, community-led methods. Multiple international surveys by the World Health Organization over several decades have indicated that the outcome for people diagnosed with schizophrenia in non-Western countries is on average better there than for people in the West. Many clinicians and researchers hypothesize that this difference is due to relative levels of social connectedness and acceptance, although further cross-cultural studies are seeking to clarify the findings. Several factors are associated with a better prognosis: female gender, acute (vs. insidious) onset of symptoms, older age of first episode, predominantly positive (rather than negative) symptoms, presence of mood symptoms and good premorbid functioning. Most studies done on this subject, however, are correlational in nature, and a clear cause-and-effect relationship is difficult to establish. Evidence is also consistent that negative attitudes towards individuals with schizophrenia can have a significant adverse impact, especially within the individual's family. Family members' critical comments, hostility, authoritarian and intrusive or controlling attitudes (termed high 'expressed emotion' or 'EE' by researchers) have been found to correlate with a higher risk of relapse in schizophrenia across cultures. =Aging= The prevalence of schizophrenia in adults age 65 and older ranges from 0.1‚Äì0.5%.Howard, R., Rabins, P. V., Seeman, M. V., Jeste, D. V., International Late-Onset Schizophrenia Group (2000).\\"Late-onset schizophrenia and very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis: An international consensus\\". The American Journal of Psychiatry, 157(2), 172-178. Aging is associated with exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms. Positive symptoms tend to lessen with age, but negative symptoms and cognitive impairments continue to worsen. Older adults with schizophrenia are prone to extrapyramidal side effects, anticholinergic toxicity, and sedation due to increased body fat, decreased total body water, and decrease muscle mass. Older adults with late-onset schizophrenia usually take half of the typical dose for older adults with early-onset schizophrenia. Continual drug treatment is common for older adults with schizophrenia and the dose may increase with age. There seem to be gender differences regarding the impact of aging on schizophrenia. Men with schizophrenia tend to have more severe symptoms in the initial stage of the disorder, but gradually improve as they age. However, women with schizophrenia tend to have milder symptoms initially, and progress to more severe symptoms as they age. The low likelihood of being married and high possibility of outliving their parents and/or siblings may lead to social isolation as one ages.

Early life and education Carpenter was born July 31, 1802 in Germantown, Pennsylvania, a son of Conrad and Ann (Adams) Carpenter, of English-American heritage. He was educated at Germantown Academy, in Germantown, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Elliott, loc.cit. He received a classical education which prepared him for his professional and scientific pursuits.Winslow, loc.cit. Business career From 1820 through 1828 Carpenter worked as an assistant in a wholesale drug firm in Philadelphia. In 1828 he started his own drug business and engaged in real estate speculation and other business ventures for his primary financial support. Scientific contributions While working as an assistant in his first job, he met Thomas Nuttall and developed an interest in the natural sciences which filled his leisure time for the remainder of his life.Elliott, loc.cit. He was particularly interested in mineralogy, and made extensive collections of minerals which he described and shared with Parker Cleaveland and other notable natural scientists of the day. He authored a number of papers published in the American Journal of Science and the American Journal of the Medical Sciences between 1825 and 1832 dealing with pharmacological matters.For example, \\"On the Mineralogy of Chester County, With an Account of Some of the Minerals of Delaware, Maryland, and Other Localities\\", American Journal of Science 14 (1828): pp. 1-10; and \\"On the Muriate of Soda, or Common Salt, With an Account of the Salt Springs in the U.S.\\" in American Journal of Science 15 (1829): pp. 1-6. He organized his collections into a museum on his Germantown estate, incorporating large collections of specimens relating to all aspects of the natural sciences, and kept specimens of rare plants collected by Nuttall in a greenhouse on his estate.Elliott, loc.cit.

It was located at 124 Street and Manhattan Avenue. History 125th Street was built in 1971 as the \\"Commonwealth Building\\" and was designed by Hausman & Rosenberg. Sydenham began as a private hospital in a Harlem brownstone in 1892, serving mostly African American patients. Around 1924 the hospital moved to a new 200-bed building at the intersection of West 125 Street and Lenox Avenue. In 1944 the staff doctors were all white despite serving a mostly African American community. Soon after, it was the first hospital to have a full desegregated interracial policy with six African American Trustees and twenty African Americans on staff. It was New York City's first full-service hospital to hire African-American doctors, and later became known for hiring African American doctors and nurses when other nearby hospitals would not.Koch (film), 2012 documentary directed by Neil Barsky Because of its relatively small size, Sydenham continually faced more financial problems than most private hospitals, and on March 3, 1949, control of it was taken by New York City and it became part of the municipal hospital system. However, in a new practice for the municipal hospital system, the city continued to allow Sydenham's private physicians to hospitalize their patients there. In 1971 Florence Gaynor became the first African American woman to head a major teaching hospital, taking over as Executive Director of Sydenham Hospital during a financial crisis. She also developed a Family Care Center that included a sickle cell anemia clinic. Soon after Mayor Ed Koch took office in 1977, during severe economic troubles for New York city, he announced an additional 10% reduction in funding for municipal hospitals, and Metropolitan Hospital (in East Harlem), and Sydenham were slated for closure. There was community support of both hospitals. In January 1979, the Committee for Interns and Residents staged a one-day walkout of doctors at municipal hospitals to protest the cuts, and were often supported on picket lines by hospital workers from District Council 37 of AFSCME.Rose Muzio, Puerto Rican Radicalism in the 1970s: El Comite-MINP. UMI 3296971, 2008. A ‚ÄúCoalition to Save Sydenham‚Äù supported legal efforts to stop the closing, organized public rallies and lobbying of elected officials, and helped publicize research to demonstrate the need for the hospital. (In 1977 the federal government designated Harlem a ‚Äúmedically underserved area, with the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph Califano calling it a ‚Äúhealth disaster area.‚Äù) While a diminished Metropolitan Hospital was saved as an ‚ÄúOutpatient Demonstration:‚Äù project, the city insisted that Sydenham had to be closed. In the spring of 1980, as Sydenham was about to be shut down, angry demonstrators stormed the hospital, and initiated an occupation that lasted 10 days under a so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Administration.‚Äù Despite the added publicity this brought, in 1980 Sydenham‚Äôs doors were closed for good. Although unsuccessful, the demonstrations raised the profile of Sydenham among people who had previously never heard of the hospital. Nurse and Health Activist Ebun Adelona said the closure of Sydenham became a ‚Äúsymbol‚Äù for Black people throughout New York to revitalize communities, improve health, and exercise political power.Ebun Adelona, ‚ÄúSydenham: Politics vs. Health Care,‚Äù City Limits, February 1983.

A native of Mexico City, his work is highly interdisciplinary in character, which explains his formal affiliations with the Lozano Long Institute for Latin American Studies, the Department of Mexican American and Latina/o Studies, and the American Studies programs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor in the department of Educational Psychology. He holds dual US and Mexican citizenship. He earned his bachelor's degree (Psychology) at the University of California at Berkeley, and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at the University of Michigan. He serves on the editorial boards of several academic journals including Psychoanalytic Psychology and Psychoanalysis, Culture, and Society. Professional history For almost two decades now he has devoted himself to doing qualitative, ethnographic work in communities in Texas and Mexico that have experienced significant conflicts, stressors, and transformation, exploring how these communities function and how individuals and cultural groups live within them. He uses a variety of media, including documentary film, photographic exhibits, and books, to capture and depict the issues he explores in these projects (see his website at: ricardoainslie.com). His initial three projects focused on Texas communities experiencing significant strain because of ethnic conflict. In No Dancin' In Anson: An American Story of Race and Social Change, he analyzed a small West Texas town's profound social change thirty years after the Civil Rights Act both in individual terms and as a collective experience. In Hempstead, Texas, he used a documentary film format Crossover: A Story of Desegregation, 1999, Total Run Time 55 minutes, funded by Humanities Texas ‚Äìthe state affiliate for the National Endowment for the Humanities, to illustrate the bittersweet legacy of school desegregation. The film has been screened to a broad range of audiences across the country (including the National Science Foundation's Chautauqua Course in 2003, the American Psychological Association's National Multicultural conference in 2005, conferences at historically African American universities and community Black History Month events ‚Äìover 22 screenings in all). Crossover became the cornerstone for \\"Crossover Lives,\\" a Humanities Texas ‚Äì National Endowment for the Humanities oral history project exploring personal narratives of the experience of school desegregation. Following the 1998 racially motivated dragging death of James Byrd, a black man killed by three white supremacists in Jasper, Texas, Ricardo Ainslie explored the impact of the murder on that community in several scholarly journal articles. He also created, wrote, and produced Jasper, Texas: The Healing of a Community in Crisis, a traveling photographic exhibit (New York City, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Galveston) for which he enlisted the collaboration of photographer Sarah Wilson (the exhibit book won the Digital News Award for Best Project -photography, text, design- in 2003). The exhibit development and the traveling exhibit events were funded by several grants from Humanities Texas. His 2004 book, Long Dark Road: Bill King and Murder in Jasper, explores the psychology of the white supremacist that played the lead role in the Byrd murder. Long Dark Road was runner up for Best Non-Fiction for the 2005 Hamilton Book Awards. In 2006, Ricardo Ainslie completed a documentary film, Looking North: Mexican Images of Immigration (TRT 30 minutes, funded by Humanities Texas and the Trull Foundation). For this film he interviewed people in Mexico from all walks of life in order to convey how Mexicans experience the phenomenon of migration and its impact on their country. Looking North was screened as part of the American Psychological Association's Expert Conference on Immigration (San Antonio, 2006) as well as at the Linneae Terrarum, International Borders Conference (El Paso-Ciudad Juarez, 2006). He has also used this film in a series of Humanities Texas ‚Äì sponsored immigration workshops across Texas. In 2007, Ricardo Ainslie completed Ya Basta! Kidnapped in Mexico (TRT 74 minutes), a feature-length documentary film. The film uses Mexico's present climate of insecurity as a vehicle for exploring Mexico's transition to democracy, a process that has revealed long-standing deficits within its institutions, most notably deep- seated corruption within law enforcement and a flawed judicial system. This project was funded in part by the Yip Harburg Foundation and the Meredith Foundation. Ya Basta! has been screened at numerous film festivals in the United States, Mexico, and Europe, including South by Southwest Film Festival -USA, Cine Las Americas Film Festival -USA, Festival en Corto ‚ÄìSan Miguel de Allende & Guanajuato -Mexico, Festival de Cine Morelia -Mexico, Leeds Film Festival -UK, Lonestar International Film Festival ‚ÄìUSA, and Festival Internacional de Cine -Puebla, Mexico. Ya Basta! has also aired on television in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and has been screened at universities and professional conferences. Ricardo Ainslie completed The Mystery of Consciousness (2010), a 26-minute documentary film funded by the Mind Science Foundation. In this film he used interviews with leading neuro-scientists from around the world to explore the neuroscience behind our understanding of how our brains create the experience of reflection and subjectivity. In 2013, Ricardo Ainslie completed The Fight to Save Ju√°rez: Life in the Heart of Mexico's Drug War, a book that explores the evolution, strategy, and status of Mexico's war against drug trafficking through the lens of its central battleground: the city of Juarez, Mexico. He spent nearly two years traveling to Ju√°rez, interviewing journalists, human rights activists, family members of victims of violence, politicians, law enforcement, community leaders, and educators. He also interviewed several members of then-Mexican president Felipe Calder√≥n's security cabinet for the book. He is currently working on The Mark of War, a feature-length documentary film in which he examines the transformative experience of being in at war through the narratives of seven Vietnam War, exploring their childhoods, their experiences in combat, and their lives since coming home.

He played a prominent role in the 1808 to 1814 Spanish War of Independence and held a number of senior military positions but was executed in 1817 for leading a failed revolt against the government of Ferdinand VII. In 1820, the Cortes or Spanish Parliament, declared him a hero of Spanish democracy and installed a plaque to his memory in the Palacio de las Cortes, Madrid, where it remains. Background Luis Roberto de Lacy was born 11 January 1775, in San Roque, C√°diz, to Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick de Lacy, an officer in the Ultonia or Ulster Regiment, a foreign unit or Infanter√≠a de l√≠nea extranjera of the Spanish army. Patrick died sometime before 1785, and his wife Antonia remarried Jean Gautier, another Ultonia officer. His grandfather, General Patrick de Lacy y Gould (1678-?), came from Limerick; along with many relatives, he was part of the post-1691 Irish diaspora known as the Flight of the Wild Geese. His brother, Peter (1678‚Äì1751), was a general in the Imperial Russian Army, whose son, Count Franz Moritz von Lacy (1725‚Äì1801), became an Austrian Fieldmarshall. Patrick himself settled in Barcelona and commanded the Ultonia during the 1701 to 1714 War of the Spanish Succession. De Lacy's uncle, Francis Anthony de Lacy (1731‚Äì1792), commanded Spanish forces in the 1779 to 1783 Great Siege of Gibraltar and later served as envoy to Sweden and Russia. He was created a Knight of the order of Carlos Tecera and appointed Capit√°n-General of Catalonia in 1789. An aunt married George Browne, another Irish exile who was Governor-General of Livonia, Russia. While serving with the Imperial French army, de Lacy was based in Quimper, Brittany, where he met Emilia Guermer. Her Royalist family disapproved of her relationship with an officer in Napoleon's army but she accompanied de Lacy when his unit was posted to Holland. They apparently had a child but his wife disappears from the record after 1807. Service with the Royal Spanish Army; 1785 to 1803 De Lacy was commissioned into the Ultonia regiment when he was 10, although his age was recorded as 13 to satisfy minimum requirements. Issuing commissions to children was not unusual, as they were considered private investments and often used to provide pensions for orphans. Although by now the Ultonia was no longer 'Irish', many of the officers were Spanish-born descendants of the original Irish emigrants, including his uncle Francis and various cousins. In 1789, de Lacy joined an expedition to Puerto Rico, accompanied by his stepfather. They apparently quarrelled and on their return, de Lacy walked to Porto, in Portugal, intending to take ship to the Moluccas, before his stepfather brought him home. Promoted captain, he took part in the War of the Pyrenees against France, which ended with the April 1795 Peace of Basel. He was posted to the Canary Islands in 1799, where he fought a duel with the local Capit√°n-General. Despite being transferred to El Hierro, he continued their feud; he was court- martialed as a result and sentenced to one year in the Royal Prison at the Concepci√≥n Arsenal at C√°diz. Service with the Imperial Army; 1803 to 1808 Ferdinand in 1808 led to the revolt known as the Dos de Mayo Uprising His jailers allegedly considered him mentally unbalanced; as a result, De Lacy was stripped of his commission, and barred from re-enlisting in the Spanish army. He moved to France in order to continue his career and was appointed captain in the Irish Legion, a French army unit formed in Brittany and intended to support an Irish rising. Although many of its officers were Irish exiles or of Irish descent, like De Lacy, the rank and file were mostly Polish. When the proposed rebellion failed to materialise, the Legion was posted to the Netherlands, where it remained until the War of the Third Coalition ended in 1806. De Lacy was appointed commandant of the second battalion, which participated in the 1807 invasion of Portugal. In March 1808, Charles IV of Spain abdicated in favour of his son, Ferdinand, who was replaced in May by Joseph Bonaparte and held in France. De Lacy arrived in Madrid shortly before the May 1808 revolt known as the Dos de Mayo; he deserted, and was reinstated in the Spanish army as colonel of the Burgos regiment. Service with the Spanish Army; 1808‚Äì1814 In July 1809, de Lacy was given command of the Isla de Le√≥n, an important defensive position in C√°diz, home of the Regency Council that ruled Spain in Ferdinand's absence. He led the 1st Division at the Battle of Ocana on 19 November 1809; the collapse of the Spanish cavalry under Manuel Freire de Andrade exposed him to a flank attack that practically annihilated his division. A second defeat at Alba de Tormes on 29 November left the Spanish unable to confront the French in open battle and they resorted to guerrilla tactics. Valencia in 1815; his rejection of the 1812 Constitution led to a series of revolts, including that led by de Lacy in 1817 Although C√°diz was besieged by the French from February 1810 to August 1812, support from the Royal Navy allowed the Council to send small amphibious expeditions intended to bolster resistance elsewhere. De Lacy led landings in Algeciras, Ronda, Marbella and Huelva and although unable to hold them, this absorbed French resources. In March 1811, de Lacy's troops supported an Anglo-Spanish attempt to break the siege of C√°diz; the resulting Battle of Barrosa was a significant victory, although command failures meant the siege continued. After the loss of Tarragona in June 1811, de Lacy replaced the Marquess of Campoverde as Capit√°n-General of Catalonia, a position held by his uncle Francis from 1789 to 1792. French efforts to capture Valencia weakened them elsewhere and provided the Spanish opportunities for partisan warfare. De Lacy led a series of incursions into the French departments of Haute-Garonne and Ari√®ge; these restored local morale and forced the French to send reinforcements. Most major towns, including Barcelona, Tarragona and Lleida, remained in French hands and in early 1812, Napoleon made Catalonia part of France. The focus on guerrilla tactics led to an increasingly bitter war of reprisals and executions by both sides, which severely impacted the civilian population. Many of the partisan bands were beyond central control and their operations often indistinguishable from simple brigandage. This led to conflict between de Lacy and local Catalan leaders and in January 1813, he moved to Santiago de Compostela as Captain General of the Kingdom of Galicia. He assumed command of the Reserva de Galicia, which he focused on disciplining and reorganising. Following Allied victory at Vitoria in June 1813, the French withdrew from Spain and Ferdinand returned to Madrid in April 1814. Execution and rehabilitation Execution of Luis Roberto de Lacy y Gautier, 5 July 1817 Ferdinand rejected a previous commitment to accept the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and established an absolutist regime; Spain also faced colonial wars in the Americas, which began in 1810 and continued until 1833. This destabilised the regime and led to a series of attempted coups, by military officers like de Lacy backed by progressive civilian elements, often linked by Freemasonry. Following failed attempts in 1815 and 1816, de Lacy returned to Barcelona and assisted by a former subordinate, Francisco Milans del Bosch, planned another. This began on 5 April 1817 but quickly collapsed; de Lacy was captured, court-martialed, and sentenced to death. Following public protests against the sentence, he was secretly taken to Palma, Majorca, held at Bellver Castle and executed there by firing squad on 5 July 1817. In 1820, a revolt led by Colonel Rafael del Riego forced Ferdinand to restore the 1812 Constitution; this began the Trienio Liberal, a period of liberalisation that ended in 1823, when a French army allowed Ferdinand to re-assert control. However, in 1820 the reconstituted Cortes Generales declared de Lacy a martyr; along with others including Riego, he is commemorated on a plaque in the Palacio de las Cortes, Madrid, which can still be seen today. De Lacy was buried at the Cementiri de Sant Andreu, in Barcelona.

Resentment at increasing British and other European involvement in Egypt since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 triggered an Egyptian army mutiny that threatened the authority of the British-backed Khedive of Egypt, Tewfik Pasha. The British military intervention was in response, to protect British interests. Once in Egypt, the British became involved in the conflicts in the Sudan, which Egypt had occupied since the 1820s. All recipients of the Egypt Medal were also eligible for one of the four versions of the Khedive's Star.

It was part of the West Indies squadron and served transporting U.S. sailors, marines and supplies to the pirate infested waters of the Caribbean and was used to search out and attack pirate ships and pirate strongholds. Acquisition and commissioning In 1822, the U.S. Navy purchased Terrier at Baltimore, Maryland, for service in Commodore David Porter's (1780‚Äì1843) \\"Mosquito Fleet\\" in conjunction with the campaign to suppress pirates in the West Indies. Outfitted at Norfolk, Virginia, during the latter part of 1822, she was commissioned sometime early in 1823 as USS Terrier with Lieutenant Robert M. Rose in command. Operational career Terrier departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, with the other ships of Porter's squadron on 15 February 1823. The ships reached St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies on 3 March 1823 and began patrolling the coast of Puerto Rico the next day. Terrier and the seven other shallow-draft schooners acquired at Baltimore were ideally suited to the work of exploring the coastal shallows and shoal waters of the Caribbean where the pirates were based. For the next two years, Terrier operated out of the depot Porter established at what is now Key West, Florida, and remained almost continually on station even during the two outbreaks of yellow fever ‚Äì in the autumn of 1823 and the summer of 1824 ‚Äì which sent the majority of the squadron's ships north to healthier latitudes. Terriers area of concentration was the northern coasts of Cuba and Puerto Rico, where havens for the pirates abounded and the authority of the Spanish Empire ‚Äì weakened by the Spanish struggle against Spains former colonies in Central America and South America ‚Äì proved almost non-existent. Undoubtedly, Terrier participated in many of the small expeditions and skirmishes of the squadron, but there is only one documented instance of her capturing a prize. That event occurred early in 1824, when she succeeded in retaking a French ship which had been seized by pirates. Unfortunately, the pirate crew escaped ashore to Spanish territory, a refuge into which Americans could not legally pursue them. Terrier operated in the West Indies until 1825. Disposal In 1825, a slackening in seaborne piracy enabled the U.S. Navy to begin disposing of its special-purpose, shallow-draft ships on the West Indies station. Terrier was one of the ships sold ‚Äì presumably at auction ‚Äì during 1825.

His career has spanned over twenty-five years, and during it, he has worked as a freelance cartoonist and contributed illustrations to various magazines and children's books. During the later years of his career, he wanted to write a story lengthier than a thirty-two page children's book. In August 2011, his only novel Eddie: The Lost Youth of Edgar Allan Poe was published. His art style is inspired by the Golden Age of American Illustration. Due to this, his work has a fairytale-like appearance and many of his illustrations feature fantastical and Biblical characters and settings. Personal life Gustafson was born and raised in Marengo, Illinois. He enjoyed drawing as a child and his dream was to become an artist. During high school, the works of Walt Disney and the Warner Brothers inspired him to pursue a career in animation. He attended college at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. While he was there, he focused on animation classes and only took one illustration class. The school experienced internal troubles and had to close down. This caused Gustafson to transfer to Columbia College Chicago. He continued his pursuit of animation but started to consider a career in children's books when he took a children's book illustration class. Gustafson is married and has a son. He works at home with his wife, Patty. She handles the computer and digital aspects of their business, while he works in his studio. Due to this, he has stated that he is computer illiterate. In an interview with ‚ÄúInsights from Illinois Authors,‚Äù Gustafson stated that he started out using gouache, acrylics, and watercolor for his works. He mainly relied on acrylics, however, because they dried quickly, enabling him to meet deadlines. When he began work on his first trade book, The Night Before Christmas by Clement Clarke Moore, he started to use oils due to having a more relaxed deadline. Once he learned how to use oils more effectively and mix Liquin with them, they became his preferred medium to work in. Career Gustafson graduated from college with a degree in animation. Despite this, Gustafson worked as a freelance artist after college instead because he learned that working in the field of animation was more restrictive than working in the field of illustration. When asked about this career choice, Gustafson has stated, ‚ÄúThe opportunities of animation, in terms of subject matter and creative control, weren‚Äôt nearly as interesting or rewarding as those of illustration. As an animator, your contribution to a given film is, by necessity, limited to whatever character you‚Äôve been assigned. But as an illustrator, you‚Äôre responsible for locations, sets, costumes, props, lighting, and character designs, not mention the overall mood and emotion of a given painting. It‚Äôs about the best job there is.\\" During his early years, he illustrated for small presses in the Chicago area and magazines. Some time later, he received a call from New York and worked on a storybook version of Clement Clarke Moore's The Night Before Christmas a few months later. In 1997, The Greenwich Workshop Collection released ‚Äútreasures for the child in each of us.‚Äù It is a collection of three-dimensional art created by Gustafson. Gustafson has been commissioned by various publishers and companies such as Celestial Seasonings, Playboy magazine, Saturday Evening Post, The Bradford Exchange, and DreamWorks. Books Gustafson has stated that he has planned out stories on the side while he has worked on children's books, but those ideas never got approval from his editors. He then realized that the stories he wanted to tell would not work as a short picture book. He then got the idea for Eddie: The Lost Youth of Edgar Allan Poe and decided to attempt to write a longer story. The idea was approved, and in 2011, the book was released. Gustafson stated that his goal when writing Animal Orchestra was not for it to just be entertaining for children but also educational. His goal with Eddie: The Lost Youth of Edgar Allan Poe was to introduce young readers to the work of Edgar Allan Poe in hopes they would explore his writings. Books by other authors that feature his work include: The Night Before Christmas by Clement Clarke Moore, Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie, and The Nutcracker. His own works are: Alphabet Soup, Animal Orchestra, Classic Fairy Tales, Favorite Nursery Rhymes from Mother Goose, and Eddie: The Lost Youth of Edgar Allan Poe. Awards Gustafson has won multiple awards over his career. He has been awarded a Chelsea Award by the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists and an Independent Publisher Book Award for Best Children's Picture Book. He has also received a Chesly Award (2005) for Best Interior Artwork and a CA Illustration Award.

It was built in 1807 as the estate of Shubel Smith, a sea captain, and is one of Ledyard's finest surviving farmhouses from that period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The listing included three contributing buildings on a area, including the Georgian Colonial house and the \\"Yellow Barn\\" as well as a smaller outbuilding. Both of the large buildings have modernized interiors, serving as a bed and breakfast called Stonecroft Country Inn. Description and history The Shubel Smith House is located in a rural setting of southeastern Ledyard, on the west side of Pumpkin Hill Road. The property's built infrastructure is basically that of a 19th-century farmstead, with the main house, a barn, and a shed/garage building. The barn is a 20th-century structure built on an older foundation; the original was destroyed in the New England Hurricane of 1938. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide and symmetrically arranged, with a center entrance set in a projecting gabled vestibule. Building corners are adorned with pilasters. A two-story ell extends to the left side at a recess, with a modern bay window filling in part of the corner. The interior follows a modification to the typical center chimney plan: because of the larger entrance vestibule, the chimney stack is set further forward than normal, and the kitchen (placed behind the chimney) is thus larger than usual. The interior retains a number of original period features, and includes a loom in one of the second-floor chambers that appears to date to the house's construction. The property is a small portion of a once-larger estate purchased in 1795 by Charles Smith for his son Shubel, apparently in anticipation of the latter's marriage the following year. Shubel Smith raised livestock for sale in the West Indies, and it is thought that some of the many stone walls on the property are related to penning the animals. He apparently first occupied the house then standing on the property, building this one in 1807 and recycling materials from the other one. The property remained in the hands of the Smith family until at least 1896.

Life and education Since her beginnings studying Applied Theatre Studies in Gie√üen, her first works at the German State Theatres in the early 90s with teachers such as Heiner M√ºller, George Tabori and Gerhard Bohner, several years at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt, and with her free-lance productions made in coproduction with German and international theatres and festivals, she points to social sore spots, creating total works of art that go far beyond traditional dance-theatre. Helena Waldmann's works have won prizes and travelled around the world ‚Äì to Europe, India, Iran and Afghanistan, Egypt, Palestine, Kenia, South America, Korea and Vietnam. Her opinion is in demand in symposiums, as a lecturer and in workshops in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Japan, Korea and Switzerland. These journeys have also continually inspired her to make new works: works such as \\"Letters from Tentland\\", produced in Tehran for six Iranian women, \\"Return to sender\\", her commentary on European immigration policy, performed by six exiled Iranian women, as well as \\"Feierabend! - das Gegengift -\\", her anarchic, delirious antidote to the dictatorship of our modern meritocracy. In the captivating \\"BurkaBondage\\" she presented the Muslim veil and Japanese bondage in an uptempo relationship between shackle and protection. \\"get a revolver\\", a solo for Brit Rodemund, who in 2011 was named \\"Dancer of the Year\\", is a celebration of forgetting in which Helena Waldmann senses a possible happiness. In \\"Happy Piece\\" she declares the smallest stage to a powder keg of dance. Four fearless heralds of fortune find happiness in the rebelliousness of energy and in their dignity. Works Helena Waldmann's works, such as Die Krankheit Tod, Vodka konkav, and Cheshire Cat, created between 1993 and 1999, were internationally acclaimed. The political force of her choreographies after 2000 resulted from a mimicry of exile and inner immigration. She became the first female director from the West to be invited to work in Iran. The result was Letters from Tentland, which was produced recently in Tehran for six Iranian women. Her ballet, Crash, about extreme sports was produced in Saarbr√ºcken. Other works include Return to Sender, a commentary on European immigration policy, and Feierabend! das Gegengift, produced in Berlin. In 2003, Waldemann received the UNESCO Prize for her Brazilian production Headhunters. Her teaching positions, workshops, and numerous commissions have taken her to Switzerland, Greece, China, Brazil, Iran, Palestine, India, Afghanistan, Japan, and Bangladesh. Waldmann's performance has toured through India and Sri Lanka at the invitation of the Goethe-Institut. Burka Bondage is about the passion and pain of two women struggling for freedom under the burka and the restraints of Japanese bondage. Waldemann juxtaposed the Muslim burqa and Japanese bondage‚Äîa technique that shackles, and created Burka Bondage \\"to illustrate the interdependence and knotting together of practices, cultures as well as individuals\\". Revolver Besorgen (Get a revolver), another of her productions, is dedicated to people with dementia. Waldmann focuses on the social stigma associated with the loss of memory. Waldmann describes the ability to forget as an essential, basic function of the human memory; it is one that brings freedom like the \\"Delete\\" key on the computer.

The command was formed in September 1942 and by April 1943 comprised 27 squadrons, including units from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Australia. Coming under the operational authority of Allied Air Forces Headquarters in the South West Pacific Area, RAAF Command exercised control of its units through geographically based area commands in Australia and, later, New Guinea, as well as large mobile formations including the Australian First Tactical Air Force. The command reached a strength of 41 squadrons in October 1944. From the time of its establishment, until its disbandment in September 1945, it was led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock. History =Establishment and control= Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters was established under General Douglas Macarthur's South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command on 20 April 1942. All Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flying units in the theatre, except training squadrons, were assigned to the control of the AAF commander, Lieutenant General George Brett, along with all United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (NEI) units.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, p.473 The RAAF's operational headquarters, including all geographically based area commands, fighter sectors, and combat air bases, were also subordinate to AAF Headquarters.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.15‚Äì16 On 3 September 1942, the new AAF commander, Major General George Kenney, formed the bulk of his USAAF squadrons into the Fifth Air Force. He then formed the majority of RAAF units, as well as the 49th Fighter Group USAAF, into another organisation, initially known as Coastal Defence Command, with his chief of staff, Air Vice Marshal William (Bill) Bostock, as air officer commanding. The establishment of Coastal Defence Command was officially announced on 8 September 1942; the new formation was renamed RAAF Command three days later, as Bostock felt that the previous name did not do it justice. The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under RAAF Command were those based in New Guinea as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, which was controlled by Fifth Air Force.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, pp.585‚Äì588Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.4‚Äì6Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, pp.143‚Äì146 RAAF Command was charged with defending Australia, except in the north-east, protecting the sea lanes to New Guinea, and conducting operations against Japanese shipping, airfields and other installations in the Dutch East Indies.Bostock, William Dowling (1892‚Äì1968) at Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved on 26 December 2010.Horner, \\"The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements\\", pp.17‚Äì18 Its role was thus \\"mainly defensive\\" at the outset, with the expectation that \\"in the event of developments in the North and North-West of Australia, this would be altered\\".Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, pp.147‚Äì151 Bostock was to exercise control of air operations through the RAAF area command system, comprising North-Western, Western, Southern, Eastern, and North-Eastern Area Commands.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p.144 While the arrangements effectively gave him operational command of the RAAF in the South West Pacific, administrative control of the units was retained by Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne, and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones. Bostock was thus in the position of having to serve two masters, reporting to Kenney for tasking but to Jones for supplies and equipment.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp.119‚Äì120 Despite the Australian Chiefs of Staff Committee recommending \\"unified operational and administrative control\\" of the Air Force, the division of command was permitted to continue, and was a source of \\"acute personal tension\\" between the RAAF's two most senior officers for the remainder of the war.Odgers, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp.42‚Äì43 Jones had opposed the creation of RAAF Command as a separate organisation to Air Force Headquarters, and only formally recognised it as an RAAF unit headquarters in March 1943, eight months after it had been established.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, pp.177‚Äì179 =Operations and expansion= By April 1943, the disposition of the AAF was such that RAAF Command, headquartered in Brisbane, Queensland, controlled 27 squadrons: 24 Australian units plus one each from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Its main war-fighting effort was centred in North-Western Area Command, headquartered in Darwin, Northern Territory, while No. 9 Group conducted operations in New Guinea. RAAF Command units in the Western, Southern, Eastern, and North-Eastern Area Commands were engaged in maritime patrol, anti-submarine, and minelaying operations off the Australian coast.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.140‚Äì141Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p.356 In June, the 380th Bombardment Group USAAF, operating B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, was also placed under the control of RAAF Command, which assigned the group to North-Western Area.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p.61 By the end of 1943, No. 9 Group, originally the RAAF's mobile strike force, had become engaged in static garrison duties in New Guinea. No. 10 Operational Group was raised on 13 November 1943 at Nadzab to take over that mobile function.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.182‚Äì183 In February 1944, RAAF Command took over many of the units of No. 9 Group, as well as responsibility for the Port Moresby and Milne Bay sectors; South-Eastern New Guinea thus effectively became an extension of Australia for the purposes of RAAF Command's sphere of operations.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.198‚Äì200Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, xxii No. 9 Group was subsequently renamed Northern Command, to better reflect its new function as a static area command covering New Guinea.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp.144,168Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.182‚Äì183,198‚Äì200 No. 10 Group's initial combat missions were conducted from Cape Gloucester in March, before preparations began in April for the Hollandia‚ÄìAitape landings.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.200‚Äì201 These operations were supported by a bombing and mine-laying campaign directed by RAAF Command through North-Western Area.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.213 By October 1944, No. 10 Group's name had been changed to First Tactical Air Force (No. 1 TAF), and RAAF Command's complement had swelled to 41 Australian squadrons.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.296‚Äì299 An RAAF Command forward headquarters, known as Advanced RAAF Command or ADRAAFCOM, was established on 15 March 1945 at Morotai to directly control No. 1 TAF during the upcoming Oboe operations, the reoccupation of Borneo. Responsibility for all Allied air operations south of the Philippines, as well as Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) units based in the Solomon Islands to support the Bougainville Campaign, was assigned to RAAF Command.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p.435Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp.169‚Äì170 Bostock expressed to Kenney his desire that \\"1st Tactical Air Force should continue to be employed as a forward offensive formation rather than in a garrison role\\". However, by April morale among No. 1 TAF fighter pilots, dissatisfied with the ground attack and 'mopping up' roles assigned to them, had deteriorated to such an extent that eight senior officers attempted to resign their commissions in an incident known as the \\"Morotai Mutiny\\". Kenney, Jones and Bostock all became involved in trying to defuse the situation, and the commander of No. 1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, was sacked and replaced by Air Commodore Frederick Scherger as preparations for Operation Oboe One, the invasion of Tarakan, were under way.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp.123‚Äì125 RAAF Command had control of the USAAF Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces, as well as No. 1 TAF, during the Tarakan operation, which commenced on 1 May 1945.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p.452 By this time RAAF Command comprised some 17,000 personnel.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p.439 For Operation Oboe Six, the invasion of Labuan‚ÄìBrunei in June, RAAF Command also had at its disposal aircraft based in Australia at Western and North-Western Area Commands.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.475‚Äì477 For Operation Oboe Two, the invasion of Balikpapan in July, Bostock marshalled forty Allied squadrons. His aim, in concert with that of Kenney and I Corps commander Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, was to deliver the heaviest aerial bombardment possible against enemy targets, to enable Australian assault forces to land with minimal casualties.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.482‚Äì484 MacArthur called the Labuan air offensive \\"flawless\\". With the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was dissolved and Air Force Headquarters in Melbourne assumed full control of RAAF Command.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, p.262 The formation was disbanded on 2 September 1945, the same day that Bostock, along with Jones, represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender aboard USS Missouri.Stephens, Going Solo, p.66Stephens, Going Solo, p.208 Notes References  Military units and formations of the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II Military units and formations established in 1942 Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 RAAF commands ","title":"RAAF Command"},{"id":"30205367","text":"Milky Way Farm in Giles County, Tennessee, is the former estate of Franklin C. Mars, founder of Mars Candies. The property is named for the company's Milky Way candy bar. During the Great Depression, the estate was the largest employer in the county. The estate is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an historic district; the farm and manor house are now used for weddings, tours, trail runs, & special events.Historic Manor house is now available for private reservation , Milky Way Farms website, accessed December 27, 2010  History  Franklin Mars and his second wife, Ethel V. Mars, purchased the property in 1930, shortly after establishing a southern office of Mars Candies in Nashville. Architect James F. Drake was hired to design the Tudor Revival manor house and farm facilities for breeding Thoroughbred horses and Hereford cattle. Construction peaked between 1931 and 1933. With 800 workers during construction, Milky Way Farm became the largest employer in Giles County.Caneta Skelley Hankins, Milky Way Farm, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. During construction, many of the workers lived on the farm with their families. Mars is reputed to have been generous to his workers, who received free candy bars, as well as small loans and other forms of assistance. Mars died in 1934, too soon to see the success of the farming operations. He was buried in a mausoleum on Milky Way Farm. His widow, Ethel Mars, oversaw the planned livestock operations. Milky Way Farm produced prize- winning Hereford cattle and thoroughbred horses that were winners on the racetrack, beginning with the farm's first racing season in 1934. Winnings in 1936 totaled $206,450, making the Milky Way Farm stable the season's most successful owner on the U.S. thoroughbred racing circuit.Sport: Luck and Mrs. Mars, Time, January 4, 1937 In 1940, Milky Way Farm's Gallahadion won the Kentucky Derby. In March 1945, when Ethel Mars was in declining health (she died in December 1945), the farm was sold.Ethel V. Mars, Head of Candy Firm, Dies, Billboard, January 5, 1946 In the subsequent decades it fell into disrepair until new owners stepped in to save the historic property. Description The Tudor Revival manor house has 35 rooms, including 21 bedrooms, and 12 original bathrooms. The house was designed for entertaining, and many of the individual rooms are unusually large. The living room features exposed beams and a ceiling. The Mars' dining room table is reputed to have been the largest private dining table in Tennessee. The house was surrounded by landscaped grounds, including magnolia trees, and had an outdoor swimming pool and tennis courts.Justin Leonard, Florence, Handles Sale of Milky Way, Florence (Alabama) Times, March 10, 1945 Outbuildings included 70 cottages, 30 barns, and a horse-racing track. Local limestone was used in most of the farm buildings, which have been described as having Spanish-inspired architecture. In Ethel Mars' day, the property had of fences and of roads. Outbuildings that were still intact as of 2007 included the groundskeeper's cottage; several of the barns, including an octagonal barn; stables; and well-houses. Although Franklin Mars' remains were reinterred in a Minnesota cemetery, his mausoleum at Milky Way Farm still stands. Milky Way Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 27, 1984. It was described as significant for its role in sustaining the local economy during the Depression, its association with Franklin Mars, and its architecture. Milky Way Farm Today In 2007 the property was sold for a reported price of $10 million. The buyer announced plans for a $400 million development of a luxury residential community to consist of 750 to 900 homes, an equestrian club including a horse track and polo field, a golf course, and equestrian trails.Donnie Snow, Re-raising the Bar , Business TN magazine, November 2007Dennis Ferrier, Development Under Way At Milky Way Farms; Pulaski Development To Include Golf Course, Equine Events, WSMV-TV. April 6, 2007 The developer became ill and the property went into foreclosure in May 2009. Beginning in 2010, Milky Way Farm was purchased in sections by a father and daughter until over 1100 acres of the original property was back together. With the assistance of the Tennessee Land Trust, the front acreage was placed in permanent agricultural easement, and slowly improvements began to once again protect this beautiful property. The historic Manor House, barns, roofs, roads, and stone walls have each received attention. In 2017, the reigns were passed to the daughter and her sister to continue to care for this Tennessee landmark. Weddings, tours, events, corporate meetings, trail runs, farming, guided hunts, and seasonal festivals help operate and restore this incredible property. It has been home to Warrior Dash, Tough Mudder, Green Beret Challenge, and in September 2018, the Spartan Race. The current renovation projects include improvements to the ShowBarn and some of the roads.

Ginanggang is made from a type of banana in the Philippines called saba (a cooking banana also known as the Cardaba banana). The banana is peeled, skewered and then grilled over charcoals. When the outer surface is lightly charred, it is then taken off the grill, brushed with margarine, and sprinkled with sugar. It differs from banana cue in that riper saba bananas are preferred; the banana is actually grilled on the stick instead of being fried and skewered later; and the sugar used is white table sugar and is not caramelized (being applied after cooking). A \\"Ginanggang Festival\\" is celebrated in honor of San Isidro Labrador every 2nd Sunday of May in Baranggay Poblacion, Tubod, Lanao del Norte.

The campaign reflected the British desire to reverse the defeats of the Mahdist War in the 1880s, as well as concern that France and other European powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire parts of its territory. Initially only the Egyptian Army was engaged. British Army units joined from early 1898, with two British brigades being present at the decisive victory at Omdurman on 2 September 1898, in which Winston Churchill took part. Seventeen members of the Royal Navy and 27 Royal Marines who helped man the Nile gunboats also received the medal.

St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 793. Born in 1861, Joseph Clutts moved to Wellston in 1882. Within a short period of time, he embarked on a path to make himself one of the region's most significant citizens: he purchased the nearby Wellston and Milton blast furnaces, bought a share in the ownership of the Spring Valley Iron Company, and acquired wide areas of woodland to provide fuel for his furnaces. In 1896, with Henry Adam Marting and Lewis Vogelsong, he organized the Wellston Iron and Steel Company, which operated two more blast furnaces. Along with a partner named Willard, Clutts bought out his former partners in 1898.Evans, Nelson W. A History of Scioto County, Ohio, Together with a Pioneer Record of Southern Ohio. Vol. 2.

No single architectural style can be said to dominate the house, but its size and details make it one of the city's most architecturally prominent residences.

Following Clutts' death in 1927, his home became known as the \\"Reese Building.\\" Since that time, it has ceased to be used for residential purposes; the present occupants are the law firm of Oths, Heiser, and Miller,Listing Details, Chillicothe Gazette, 2010.

Little has changed inside or outside the house in the century since its construction: although it has ceased to be used as a residence, the home still features most of its original decorative details and structural elements. In 1980, the Clutts House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its connection to Clutts himself and because of its well preserved and historically significant architecture. It is one of three buildings on the Register in the city of Wellston, along with the Morgan Mansion and the Harvey Wells House.

F. White, the compiler of The Sacred Harp, a shape note hymnbook that came to be used widely in the rural South. In revised form, the book continues to be popular among singers to this day. Little is known about King's short life. Steel (2010) suggests that he mostly likely was born in Wilkinson County, Georgia; his parents were named John King and Elizabeth Dubose. The family moved in 1828 to Talbot County.Steel (2010, 129) E. J. King worked as a farmer and also taught singing to others.Steel (2010, 129) It is clear that King was the junior member of the partnership with White (born 1800), who had already had an extensive career as a shape note composer and teacher. The early 20th century Sacred Harp editor Joseph Summerlin James suggested that King was in fact White's pupil. Yet King's musical contribution to the volume was substantial; in the present-day 1991 edition of the Sacred Harp, his name appears on 22 of the tunes as composer, arranger, or co-arranger. Steel describes King as having a distinctive musical style, and describes three of his songs, \\"Bound for Canaan,\\" \\"Sweet Canaan,\\" and \\"Fulfilment\\" as \\"classics\\".Steel (2010, 129) Steel conjectures that King may also have provided the initial financing that would have been needed to persuade the printer (in Philadelphia) to take on the job of producing the book. At the time White was \\"still establishing himself\\" as a farmer, but King came from a wealthy family with a large plantation.Steel (2010, 6) The Sacred Harp was first published in 1844; King died 31 August of the same year.Steel (2010, 129) His younger brother Elias Lafayette King (1828-1876) was an important member of the early Sacred Harp community. He served on the committee that prepared the augmented second edition (1850). He contributed six songs to this edition, of which one (308, Parting Friends) remains in the 1991 edition today.Steel (2010, 129) Four (Sweet Heaven, Parting Friends, The Lost City, The Cause of Christ) remain in the 2012 Cooper edition of The Sacred Harp.Composer index at TexasFasola.org Notes References *Steel, David Warren (with Richard H.

He worked as a paramedic alongside Sam (Rene Naufahu) but was alienated due to his sexuality. The two made up and Jamie ended up leaving the hospital. He returned some months later and the teenage Jonathon McKenna (Kieren Hutchison) developed a crush on him that eventually evolved into a love affair. Jonathon's father Michael (Paul Gittins) was heavily against the two's relationship and ended up temporarily disowning his son. Michael saved the couple from a group of homophobes but the two ended up breaking up.

Plot At the Dunphy house, Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) become worried that Alex (Ariel Winter) is studying too much. The two attempt to get her to take a break and eventually have to force her to do so. Alex eventually gets the second-highest grade in the class, behind a classmate named Sanjay Patel. Alex believes this is due to the fact that Sanjay has a doctor and a professor for parents, while she must do her best with what she was given. This statement offends Phil and Claire, with Claire starting to think they are holding their children back. Later when they go to the movies, they run into Sanjay's parents who are there to see a French movie. Phil and Claire decide to follow them to encourage their kids. Midway through the movie Phil leaves to watch Croctopus 3D, the film they originally intended to see, since they both are fans of cheesy horror films involving monsters. Phil has fun at his movie while Claire falls asleep at the highly acclaimed French one. After waking her up, Phil tells her that Alex still had one of the highest grades in the class, and dumb parents do not have kids that smart. Claire is reassured and they leave for home after seeing that the \\"bright Dr. Patel\\" cannot validate his parking ticket. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) bump into Mitchell's ex-girlfriend, Tracy (Mary Lynn Rajskub) at a mall. Mitchell suggest hanging out, but she decides against it. Later, they see Tracy with what appears to be an eight-year-old red-headed child (seen only from behind), whose approximate age would match the last time Tracy and Mitchell saw each other (and the only time Mitchell had sex with a woman). Mitchell tells this to Cameron at dinner, making him anxious. He eventually agrees with Mitchell that they should meet the child, who they are sure is his son. However, they then realize that he actually is a little person (Mark Povinelli) and Tracy's husband. The situation becomes more awkward when he opens his present from Mitchell and Cameron, a \\"Little Slugger\\" baseball glove. Meanwhile, the Hoffmans, a couple that Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) and Jay (Ed O'Neill) Pritchett met on a vacation, come to visit them much to Jay's openly (and Gloria's more discreet) chagrin. He eventually tells them his true feelings not knowing that they were spending the night at their house. The couple decides to leave in a cab, as Gloria comes down to apologize they give her a copy of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's \\"One hundred years of solitude\\" that they had signed by the author specially for her, so she convinces them to stay by telling them that Jay's \\"mind is going away\\". In the morning, Jay decides to apologize to the Hoffmans; however, during his apology he drinks from a prank glass that Manny gave him, ending in him being covered in orange juice.

Production Mary Lynn Rajskub guest starred as Mitchell's ex-girlfriend. \\"Our Children, Ourselves\\" was written by executive producers, Dan O'Shannon and Bill Wrubel. The episode was also directed by Adam Shankman. This episode was the second script collaboration by O'Shannon and Wrubel, who co-wrote the episode \\"Airport 2010\\". \\"Our Children, Ourselves\\" was filmed on October 13, and October 15, 2010. In October 2010, TV Guide reported that Mary Lynn Rajskub had been cast as Mitchell's ex-girlfriend. She filmed her appearance on October 13, 2010.

When the episode aired, the airtime was pushed 20 minutes later than its usual time slot due to Barack Obama's speech about the 2011 Tucson shooting. Reception  =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Our Children, Ourselves\\" was seen by an estimated 11.12 million households and received a 4.2 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.2% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This made it the highest-rated program on Wednesday, according to the Nielsen Media Research. The episode received a drop from the previous episode, \\"Slow Down Your Neighbors\\", possibly because of the 20-minute delay in its starting time. Despite this, the episode became the second highest- rated ABC show after Grey's Anatomy and the finished seventh in the ratings the week it premiered. =Reviews= The episode received mostly positive reviews, with many praising the ending to Mitchell and Cameron's storyline. TV Squad writer Joel Keller gave the episode a positive review, writing that it had \\"funny moments\\", but pointed out that \\"all of them left me wanting some more information to round things out.\\" John Teti of The A.V. Club called it \\"not a very good episode\\" and mainly criticized the Delgado-Pritchett storyline, comparing it to \\"every episode of Three‚Äôs Company ever.\\" Teti ultimately gave the episode a C+. Rachael Maddux of New York praised the episode for letting the characters \\"out of their primly landscaped domiciles to interact with the other batty folks of the world\\".

Steiner is known for having written the lyrics to the song \\"M.T.A.\\", about a man stuck on the Boston subway because he could not pay the exit fare. \\"M.T.A.\\" was co-written with Bess Lomax Hawes as part of a Boston political campaign in 1949 and later altered slightly by the popular folk group the Kingston Trio, becoming one of their hits in 1959.  Life and career  Steiner was born in New York City and grew up in Greenwich Village. She was Jewish She graduated from Vassar College and attended graduate courses at Radcliffe College, but left before earning her degree. During her time in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she began singing with other musicians who gathered at Bess Lomax Hawes' house, including Sam and Arnold Berman, brothers from Roxbury. A conversation between the Berman brothers inspired Hawes and Steiner to create \\"M.T.A.\\" Steiner married Arnold Berman and moved back to New York while he studied physics at Columbia University (they divorced in 1954). She was active in the folk scene in the 1950s and 60s, singing (as Jackie Berman) with Pete Seeger and others on Hootenanny Tonight! (recorded in 1954 and released by Folkways Records in 1959). Following her divorce from Berman, Steiner married publisher Myron Sharpe. They honeymooned in the Soviet Union, where she performed in concert. Novelist Matthew Sharpe is their son; they also have a daughter, Susanna. She continued to work as an editor for Myron's publishing house even after their divorce. As Jacqueline Sharpe, she released an album of antiwar songs in 1966 entitled No More War. Steiner was a linguist, as she demonstrated in 1991 with her album Far Afield: Songs of Three Continents. Steiner joined the Norwalk, Connecticut branch of the African American civil rights advocacy group the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1991, serving as the chapter's secretary for several years and receiving the Roy Wilkins Leadership Award for service from the state NAACP in 2010.

For the twenty-second time in twenty-five elections, the Republican candidate was victorious, but by a much smaller than usual margin. Superior Court Judge John S. Fine defeated Democrat Richardson Dilworth, the City Controller of Philadelphia. Major Party Candidates =Democratic= *Richardson Dilworth, Philadelphia City Controller **running mate: Michael Musmanno, Court of Common Pleas Judge (from Allegheny County) =Republican= *John Fine, Superior Court Judge (from Luzerne County) **running mate: Lloyd Wood, State Senator (from Montgomery County) Campaign Despite the popularity of outgoing governor (and 1950 U.S. Senate candidate) Jim Duff and the low approval ratings of President Harry Truman, Democrats came into the election with a cautiously optimistic outlook. In Dilworth, they had selected a charismatic candidate with a strong reputation as a reformer after serving as a key figure in the Democratic overthrow of Philadelphia's corrupt Republican political machine. Furthermore, although Republicans held registration advantages throughout the state, many voters were ambivalent toward their policies due to a 1949‚Äì50 recession that impacted crucial heavy industries. In contrast to the energetic Dilworth, the Republican nominee Fine was somewhat uncomfortable in the public eye, after having spent his career as a backroom power player and party boss. Fine had once been a close associate of progressive Governor Gifford Pinchot and had spent the previous twenty years as Northeastern Pennsylvania 's key political figure. Fine represented the consistency of the long-dominant state political machine and, although he was somewhat more conservative than the outgoing governor, was chosen as Duff's hand-picked successor to hold steady a Republican ship that was on cruise control. The election was marked by a variety of brutal personal attacks. First, Fine was forced to wage a contentious primary battle. Jay Cooke, a wealthy Philadelphia banker, mobilized the arch-conservative business wing of the party, while Charles Williams, a Lycoming County Common Pleas Judge, led a small but vocal group of anti-machine Republicans. Although Fine won by twenty points over Cooke, the party had difficulty healing their wounds in the general election. In the fall, Fine and Dilworth further toned up the rhetoric. The Philadelphia Democrat portrayed his opponent as a crony who oversaw a Tammany Hall-style patronage system and asserted that Fine's agenda would \\"roll back the Twentieth Century.\\" Fine fired back by painting Dilworth as a candidate who would be soft on communism and allow subversives to penetrate state government; he even went so far as to compare state Democrats to a \\"psychiatric problem.\\" On Election Day, Fine carried the gubernatorial ticket by about two points, despite Governor Duff's large win in the Senate race. Although Fine ran well in heavily Republican Central Pennsylvania and limited Dilworth's advantage in the Democratic stronghold of metropolitan Pittsburgh, he lost by a slim margin his home base in the Scranton/Wilkes- Barre area. Furthermore, Dilworth gained 42% of the vote in Philadelphia's four suburban counties, despite only 17% of area residents holding Democratic voter registration.

The name is homonymous with the ancient name of the nearby Motru River. Its possible position at this river's junction gives a certain importance.  Ancient sources  = Ptolemy's Geographia = Amutria is mentioned in Ptolemy's Geographia (c. 150 AD) in the form Amutrion () as an important Dacian town, at latitude 50¬∞ 00' N and longitude 44¬∞ 45' E (note that he used a different meridian and some of his calculations were off). It is located on a road between Drubetis and Potulatensioi. = Tabula Peutingeriana = Amutria is also depicted in the Tabula Peutingeriana (2nd century AD) between Drubetis and Pelendava, on one of the three roads build by Emperor Trajan in Dacia. The road was connecting into Via Trajana and most likely crossing Trajan's Bridge over the Danube. The location corresponds to the one mentioned by Ptolemy.  Etymology  Romanian archaeologist and historian Grigore Tocilescu, assumes that Amutria should be read Ad-mutriam, Ad Mutriam or Ad Mutrium, meaning by/at the Mutrium (Motru). The modern Romanian linguist Sorin Olteanu is also suggesting the form Ad Mutrius, with Mutrius possibly being the ancient name of Motru River.  Location  Amutria is hypothetically located at one of the following sites in Oltenia (Southwestern Romania): * Valea Perilor, commune CƒÉtunele, Gorj County * Motru, Gorj County * Gura Motrului, commune Butoie≈üti, Mehedin≈£i County * Boto≈üe≈üti-Paia, Dolj County = Valea Perilor/CƒÉtunele = Based on the archaeological survey and excavations performed at CƒÉtunele in 1885, 1973, and later in 1981-84, a Roman castrum and civilian settlement was discovered. The castrum lies in the Valea Perilor village, on an alluvial terrace of the Motru river, approximately 130 meters from the highway that connects the modern towns of Motru and Baia de AramƒÉ. It is bordered in the east by the ChivƒÉdarul River and was intended to oversee the Valea Motrului mountainous region inhabited by a large Dacian population. The archaeological site is cataloged as Chivadarul (LMI code GJ-I-s-B-09155) by the Romanian National Institute of Historical Monuments in the List of historical monuments in Romania. The shape of the castrum is rectangular with rounded corners, with the dimensions 156 x 114 m2. The castum is aligned lengthwise with the north- south axis, with the Porta Praetoria on the southern side. The first systematic research was made in 1973 by the Iron Gates Region Museum from Drobeta-Turnu Severin and the Institute of Archaeology, Bucharest and then continued during 1981-1984, done by Gorj County Museum in collaboration with the Institute of Archaeology in Bucharest. On the territory of the castrum were discovered many sherds of Roman and Dacian origin, indicating that the Dacians had coexisted with Roman soldiers and settlers. Some of the Dacian pottery was handmade, while others were worked on the wheel. These two populations - Dacians and Romans formed the ethnogenesis of the Romanian people and the archaeological evidence sustains this fact. An important discovery regarding the chronology of this castrum is a Roman coin issued by Emperor Gallienus (c. 218 AD ‚Äì 268 AD), that represented his wife, Salonina. This is a great indication that the castrum was still under Roman control in Gallienus' time and that it was probably abandoned only during the retreat from Dacia during Aurelian (271 ‚Äì 275 AD). It was also the discovery site of a signum militare in the form of a hand made of bronze, wearing a representation of goddess Victoria on the fingertips. The object is kept at the Iron Gates Region Museum. The earlier excavations from 1885 led to other discoveries, including coins of Alexander Severus, arrows and rings with inscriptions. To the north and east of the castrum, were the canabae (Roman civil settlements), stretching over an area of about 20 ha. A Roman road (Via Romana) was also identified. The road was connecting this site to Castrum Pinoasa, passing through the modern villages of Glogova and Apa NeagrƒÉ then heading towards Tismana River. = Boto≈üe≈üti-Paia = Locating Amutria at Boto≈üe≈üti, a site with a very rich evidence of a Roman presence, has a problem: it is not by the Motru river and does not fit the Ad Mutrium toponym connection. However, there are two significant archeological sites cataloged by the Romanian National Institute of Historical Monuments: Cetatea Micului (LMI code DJ-I-s-B-07875), a Dacian fortress from late La T√®ne Period (1st century AD) and Piscul cazacilor (LMI code DJ-I-s-B-07876) site which includes a Dacian fortress (La T√®ne Period) and a Daco-Roman settlement (2nd - 4th century). Piscul Cazacilor is one huge area (over two kilometres long) with lots with Roman artefacts, including pottery, bricks, and dressed stones. The site is placed in the northern third of the Piscul Cazacilor hill, and also on the left bank of the Paia River, to the north of the main site. Being perhaps a station, it includes the ancient Roman road connecting Drobeta with Pelendava, situated near the modern road coming from Botosesti Paia in the north. Among the archaeological findings at the Paia river, there is evidence of the Mithraic cult practiced also in Dacia. A votive plaque has been recovered, with an inscription from which it can only be read gentilicum Valerius, probably a servus villicus (slave). Another discovery is a good quality 9 cm bronze statuette depicting Mercury, the god of trade, with hair in locks, small wings in the hair and a crown (not petasus) on the head. He stands with his weight on the right leg, while the head tilts slightly to the right. The right arm hangs along the body. A corner of the mantle can be seen on the left shoulder, hanging along the arm and folding on the forearm. The statuette is in the inventory of Iron Gates Region Museum. = Gura Motrului/Butoie≈üti = Romanian journalist and historian Petru Bro»ôteanu, as well as other authors, placed Amutria at Gura Motrului, which in Romanian literally means the mouth of River Motru, based on measurements made out of Tabula Peutingeriana, and other sources. The location also fits well with the Ad Mutrium interpretation of the name. Archaeological investigations at Butoie»ôti in 1884 revealed traces of Roman civilization.

Characteristics In the 13th century, much of Europe experienced strong economic growth. The trade routes of the Italian states linked with those of established Mediterranean ports and eventually the Hanseatic League of the Baltic and northern regions of Europe to create a network economy in Europe for the first time since the 4th century. The city-states of Italy expanded greatly during this period and grew in power to become de facto fully independent of the Holy Roman Empire; outside European powers kept their armies out of Italy. florin of Firenze started to be the main currency of European trade during the Duecento During this period, the modern commercial infrastructure developed, with the creation in Italy of the double-entry book- keeping, joint stock companies, an international banking system, a systematized foreign exchange market, insurance, and government debt. Florence became the centre of this financial industry and the gold florin became the main currency of international trade. The Republic of Venice and the Republic of Genova dominated the trade in the Mediterranean sea. Many argue that the ideas that characterized the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th century Florence, in particular with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265‚Äì1321) as well as the painting of Giotto (1267‚Äì1337). The Duecento was followed by the beginning of the Italian Renaissance during the Trecento. Italian literature The thirteenth-century Italian literary revolution helped set the stage for the Renaissance. Prior to the Renaissance, the Italian language was not the literary language in Italy. It was only in the 13th century that Italian authors began writing in their native language rather than Latin, French, or Proven√ßal. The 1250s saw a major change in Italian poetry as the Dolce Stil Novo (Sweet New Style, which emphasized Platonic rather than courtly love) came into its own, pioneered by poets like Guittone d'Arezzo and Guido Guinizelli. Especially in poetry, major changes in Italian literature had been taking place decades before the Renaissance truly began. With the printing of books initiated in Venice by Aldus Manutius, an increasing number of works began to be published in the Italian language in addition to the flood of Latin and Greek texts that constituted the mainstream of the Italian Renaissance. The source for these works expanded beyond works of theology and towards the pre-Christian eras of Imperial Rome and Ancient Greece. This is not to say that no religious works were published in this period: Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy reflects a distinctly medieval world view. This masterpiece helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written (also in most present-day Italian-market editions), as the standardized Italian language. Christianity remained a major influence for artists and authors, with the classics coming into their own as a second primary influence. Italian painting Madonna and Child by Duccio di Buoninsegna, created in 1280 The art of the region of Tuscany (and northern Italy) in the second half of the 13th century was dominated by two masters: Cimabue of Florence and Duccio of Siena. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, Guido of Siena, Coppo di Marcovaldo and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have originated, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked in a manner that was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting. Cimabue and Duccio both took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, Pietro Cavallini of Rome. Giotto (born in 1266) by tradition a shepherd boy from the hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time. Giotto, possibly influenced by Pietro Cavallini and other Roman painters, did not base the figures that he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine-related contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of frescoes of the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin that he painted in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua set a new standard for narrative pictures. His Ognissanti Madonna hangs in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, in the same room as Cimabue's Santa Trinita Madonna and Duccio's Ruccellai Madonna where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made.All three are reproduced and compared at Italian Renaissance painting, development of themes One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance. Italian architecture \\"Pulpito del Battistero di Pisa\\", of Nicola Pisano. In the early Duecento in Italy started to appear the Italian Gothic. The first Italian Gothic edifices were Cistercian abbeys. They spread in the whole Italian territory, often adapting the construction techniques to the local traditions. There were in fact brickwork edifices in the Pianura Padana, while stone prevailed in central Italy and Tuscany. In the latter was sometimes present the by-chrome wall decoration from the local Romanesque tradition. The most important edifices include the Chiaravalle Abbey in northern Italy and the Casamari Abbey in central Italy. Among the non-Cistercian buildings of this century which were influenced by the Gothic style, though still presenting important Romanesque features, are the Parma Baptistery by Benedetto Antelami and the church of Sant'Andrea in Vercelli, also featuring Antelami's influences. This century saw the construction of numerous Gothic buildings for the Mendicant Orders. The most important ones include: *Basilica of San Francesco of Assisi (1228‚Äì1253) *Church of Santa Maria della Spina, Pisa (1230) *Basilica of Sant'Antonio of Padua *Church of San Francesco, Bologna (1236‚Äì1263) *Church of Santa Maria Novella, Florence Also notable is the civil and military construction program promoted by Emperor and King of Sicily Frederick II of Hohenstaufen in southern Italy at the beginning of the century. The most important works promoted by him include: *Castel del Monte, in Apulia *Castel Maniace, in Syracuse, Sicily *Triumphal Gate in Capua (destroyed) In this period some cathedrals were also constructed or finished, such as the Siena Cathedral.

Maruya are commonly sold as street food though they are also popular as home-made merienda snacks among Filipinos. Variants A variant of maruya may also use dessert bananas, which are usually just mashed before mixing them with batter. They can also be made from sweet potatoes. Among Muslim Filipinos, this version is known as jampok, and traditionally use mashed Latundan bananas. In the Bicol Region, it is also known as sinapot or baduya in the Bikol languages. Although this version does not \\"fan\\" the bananas. They are instead simply sliced lengthwise before frying in batter. It is also known as kumbo in the Western Visayas region. Bunwelos na saging A similar dessert to maruya is bunwelos na saging, which is more accurately a type of bu√±uelo (Spanish-derived flour doughnuts). It has more flour mixture than maruya. It also uses mashed ripe saba bananas rather than dessert bananas. It is made by mixing the bananas in flour, egg, and sugar, and then deep frying the mixture as little balls.

He accumulated a large and important collection of books about Arizona, which he donated to the University of Arizona in Tucson. (The collection was later acquired by the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles.) He also wrote a copiously illustrated guide, Arizona Sketches, to some of the more important landmarks in the state. Munk was born in Columbiana County, Ohio on Nov 9, 1847, son of Joseph and Maria Rosenberry Munk. He fought in Civil War, and after he returned home in 1865 he attended Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio and then at Eclectic Medical Institute of Cincinnati, where he graduated in 1869. He first practiced in Lindsey, Ohio, then in Chillicothe, Missouri (1871), Topeka, Kansas (1881), and finally settled in Los Angeles, California (1892). In 1876 he was elected Vice President of the National Eclectic Medical Association. He was also Professor and Dean of Climatology of the Los Angeles Eclectic Policinic, of which he was a founder. Munk married Emma Beazall in 1873. He died (\\"of angina pectoris\\") in Los Angeles 4 Dec 1927. In 1883 Munk became partners in a cattle ranch located near Willcox, Arizona. In 1884 he made his first trip to the state. In order to learn more about the area, he bought Richard Josiah Hinton's The Handbook to Arizona and then bought books mentioned in it. This marked the beginning of his career as a bibliophile and what was to become a large and important collection of books about Arizona. By 1900 this collection was large enough for him to publish a bibliography describing it. In order to find a home for his library and collection, Munk donated it in 1908 to the University of Arizona Library where the collection was described in a bibliography written by Hector Alliot. The collection was later acquired by the Southwest Museum, Los Angeles Munk's brother was Edward R. Monk, who, in addition to being Munk's partner in Arizona business, was a judge in Cochise County, Arizona from 1886‚Äì1890, and a regent of the university in 1895.

The company is one of several utilities acquired by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company during the 1920s and 1930s to form the modern PG&E; system.  History  The company was first organized as the San Joaquin Electric Company on April 1, 1895 by engineer James Samuel Eastwood for the construction of the hydroelectric San Joaquin Powerhouse No. 1, located 37 miles from Fresno on Willow Creek, a tributary of the San Joaquin River. The company later became the San Joaquin Power Company in 1905 and then the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation in 1910. By 1920, the company had 11 powerhouses. San Joaquin's early business was challenged by the competing Fresno Gas and Electric Company, controlled by Fulton G. Berry, owner of Fresno's Grand Central Hotel. Berry used riparian claims filed on water upstream from San Joaquin Electric Company's intake flume to divert water away from the company's powerhouse through a mile-long ditch. Combined with several years of drought, this diversion of water forced San Joaquin Electric into bankruptcy in 1899. Despite the company's bankruptcy, San Joaquin Electric continued to operate. Bondholders, seeking to protect their investment by providing the company's powerhouse a steady source of water, financed the 1901 construction of what would become the hydraulic fill Crane Valley Dam and the reservoir of Bass Lake. San Joaquin Electric Company was purchased out of bankruptcy in 1902 by William G. Kerckhoff, a lumber magnate and president of Pacific Light & Power, and reincorporated as the San Joaquin Power Company. Under Kerckhoff, San Joaquin Power Company purchased the electric system of the competing Fresno Gas and Electric Company in 1903 for $25,000. San Joaquin Power also reached a separate 1903 agreement with the California Gas and Electric Company‚Äîwhich would merge with the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company two years later to create PG&E;‚Äîsetting territories for electrical service, drawing a line that extended roughly from the southern border of Santa Cruz County east to the southern border of Mono County. San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation was acquired in 1924 by the Great Western Power Company, a subsidiary of The North American Company. North American subsequently sold its interests in the combined utilities to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in 1930 in exchange for $114 million in PG&E; stock, creating a single consolidated utility serving most of Northern and Central California.

Peter Debra, \\"About Us\\" (Accessed 27 Dec 2010) History Trinity Church - Lutheran (1729-1776), Broadway, New York City The congregation was founded in 1643 by Dutch Lutherans in New Amsterdam but the church was not chartered until December 6, 1664, when the new governor, Richard Nicolls, issued a charter after the British had taken control of the colony in April 1664. The first church building was constructed in 1671 on the present Broadway site of Trinity Episcopal Church, outside the walls of the city. This building was destroyed in 1673, and the congregation constructed a new church to the south of Rector Street and Broadway. This structure was later described as a \\"cattle shed\\" and replaced with a new stone edifice known as Trinity Church, and dedicated on June 29, 1729. German-speaking members seceded from the congregation in 1750 and purchased a brewery on Cliff Street, which became Christ Church Lutheran. That year, the Rev. Henry Melchior Muhlenberg began to serve the church, starting a parish school in 1752. Beginning in 1770, Rev. Bernard Michael Houseal served the church for 14 years. His home and Trinity Church was destroyed during the New York Fire of 1776. The church records escaped the fire and the congregation thereafter worshiped in the Cedar Street Scotch Presbyterian Church. In 1874, Rev. Houseal escaped New York as a Loyalist. In 1784, Christ Church Lutheran united with Trinity Lutheran Church as the United German Lutheran Churches in New York City. After the merger, services were held in the former Christ Church building at Frankfort and William streets, which had been built in 1767 and was known as The Old Swamp Church. The congregation was one of the founders of the New York Ministerium in 1786. An English-language Lutheran church was founded and built in 1822 on Walker Street, at the east end of Broadway, and named Saint Matthew‚Äôs Church. Always in debt, it was sold in 1826 for $22,750 after the United German Lutheran Churches declined to help the church. Shortly thereafter, the building was resold at the same price to the United German Lutheran Churches, and the result was referred to as \\"Christ and Old Trinity\\". The congregation maintained both buildings, with Christ Church conducting services in German and St. Matthew's Church in English. The Christ Church building was sold in 1831 and the congregation met in St. Matthew's until 1838, when the congregation assumed the name St. Matthew's with predominantly German services. Starting in May 1840 English services were no longer held due to German immigration and the huge turnout for the German services. Other congregations which branched from St. Matthew's around this time include: *St. Paul‚Äôs German Evangelical Lutheran Church, now located on West 22nd Street, was founded in 1841 by St. Matthew's former pastor. Deutsche Evangelisch- Lutherische St.-Pauls-Kirche New York , German, retrieved 5 March 2014. *St Mark‚Äôs Evangelical Lutheran Church was founded in 1847 as a branch church of St. Matthew's. It was subsidized by Trinity, the Old Church. In 1852 the United Lutheran Churches of New York celebrated their 100th Anniversary. In 1868, St. Matthew's sold its Walker Street church and, as the German Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saint Matthew in the City of New York, acquired the former First Baptist Church at Broome and Elizabeth streets. In 1881 the Concordia Collegiate Institute of the Missouri Synod (now known as Concordia College‚ÄîNew York) was founded at the Broome Street church. St. Matthew's subsidized the institute until its 1893 move to Hawthorne, New York. The chapel at 145th St In 1885, St. Matthew's left the New York Ministerium to join the more conservative Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States, now known as the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS), to which it still belongs. In 1903, St. Matthew's built a brick and stone church and a three-story residence for $25,000 at 300 West 9th Avenue at 44th Street to designs by architect John Boese of 280 Broadway. In 1906, St. Matthew erected a mission chapel at 145th Street and Convent Avenue. The Broome Street church closed in 1913 and the congregation moved to the 145th Street and Convent Avenue mission chapel. Nearby at 145th Street and Convent Avenue, the church built a four-story brick and stone parish house in 1908 at a cost of $50,000 to designs by architect John Boese. St. Matthew's merged in 1945 with Messiah Mission Church in the Inwood, Manhattan neighborhood and moved into that church building. In 1956, construction of a new church building was begun at 202 Sherman Avenue in Inwood, and completed in 1957. This building was sold in 2006, and demolished along with its elementary school, being replaced by an apartment building.

The two congregations reunited in 1784 as The United German Lutheran Churches in New York City, but still referred to as Christ and old Trinity. The two united congregations began sharing the St. Matthew's Church structure in 1822 while keeping separate names. This continued until the name ceased in 1838 and the congregation was just called the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Matthew.Rev. Peter Debra, \\"Timeline of Messiah Mission Church,\\" (Accessed 27 Dec 2010)Rev. Peter Debra, \\"About Us\\" (Accessed 27 Dec 2010) The present New York Lutheran church of the same name, Christ Church was founded much later after the Old Christ Church name was no longer used. History German members succeeded from the German and Dutch Trinity Lutheran Church in 1750 founding Christ Church after purchasing and adaptively reusing a brewery on Cliff Street as a church. In 1767, the congregation built a church at Frankfort and William Streets, later known as The Old Swamp Church. In 1784, Christ Church Lutheran unites with Trinity Lutheran Church as The United German Lutheran Churches in New York City. With merger, services are held in the former Christ Church building. The Trinity Church had been destroyed in 1776 and not rebuilt. An English-language Lutheran church is founded and built in 1822 on Walker Street, at the east end of Broadway, called Saint Matthew's Church. Always in debt, it is sold in 1826 for $22,750.00 after The United German Lutheran Churches in New York City refuses to aid St. Matthew's. Shortly thereafter the building was resold at the same price to The United German Lutheran Churches in New York City, referred to as Christ and old Trinity. The congregation maintains both buildings with Christ Church speaking German and St. Matthew's Church speaking English. The former Christ Church is sold in 1831 and the congregation meets in St. Matthew's until 1838 when the congregation assumes the name St. Matthew's.

He was known as \\"the father of irrigation in the Southwest.\\"\\"May Go Haying in Automobile,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 2, 1909, page 14 Access to this link requires the use of a library card. Business career Barstow began his business career at the age of seventeen and eventually \\"founded, financed or organized\\" five worsted and paper mills in Rhode Island. He then turned his attention to the Pecos Valley in Texas, where the Pioneer Canal Company was chartered on September 30, 1889, with Barstow as treasurer. He later served as president of a successor company, the Pecos Valley Land and Irrigation Company. In 1891 Barstow and other land developers formed a project to promote a town on the Texas and Pacific Railway in western Ward County, Texas. By 1895 the town had taken on the name of Barstow, and Barstow himself moved there from New York City in 1904. He took part in organizing other irrigation and drainage systems through the West. Volunteer work Barstow, a Republican, wrote pamphlets on varied subjects, including immigration, cooperatives, China-Japan relations and Americanism. =Irrigation and immigration= In 1908‚Äì09 Barstow was the president of the National Irrigation Congress, the leading organization interested in water projects in the West, and he was in charge of the annual convention in 1909 in Spokane, Washington. A Los Angeles Times reporter wrote about the impending congress that Barstow \\"has been a prime mover in inducing the federal government to build the systems that will make fertile over 3,000,000 acres of land which once was a desert.\\" In an interview, Barstow predicted that isolated farmhouses would become \\"a thing of the past\\" and that farmers would commute from their homes to farms via fast horses or automobiles or interurban streetcars. He added: > The government is laying out towns every five miles. . . . The farms will be > small, ten to forty acres, and the farming intensive. Under these > circumstances, the farmers will live in towns of 1500 to 2000 people, > enjoying all the benefits of urban life ‚Äî schools, churches and social life. > . . . A tide from the city to the country has already set in. Many college > graduates have chosen farming on irrigated tracts for their life work.

Later in the day, the Superintendent was shot dead. An official inquiry by the Attorney-General of Queensland followed. Those involved in the shooting death were charged with murder, but during the trial, under the advice of the trial judge, the Crown Prosecutor dropped the charges.  Background  The Superintendent of the settlement was Robert Henry Curry; he had been the Superintendent of Palm Island since the settlement was moved from Hull River twelve years earlier. His wife died during childbirth in November 1929. The Medical Officer at the settlement was Dr. C. Maitland Pattison. According to Dr Joanne Watson's biography of Curry, \\"By December [1929] Curry was grief-stricken, fearful of losing his position, drinking heavily and withdrawing from novocaine‚ÄîPattison's treatment for 'neuralgia of the cranial nerve'.\\" During the 1920s, rivalries, bitterness and escalating feuds appear to have developed between the white officials on Palm Island. As a result of this situation there were several investigations into the conduct of officials on Palm Island. Stipendiary Magistrate Cameron chaired one inquiry ending on 18 April 1929, while Justice Nevitt chaired another, which provided its report to the Home Department on 7 February 1930. The allegations investigated included: * A documented assault on a clerk (Tedman) by Curry in 1919; * An alleged threat to torch the residence if removed, made by Curry to Gall in 1925; * At least two alleged assaults on Ballard by Curry in the mid-1920s; * A drunken altercation between Curry and Gall in Lowthes Hotel (South-Townsville) in 1927; * At least two assaults on Dr Pattinson by Curry in 1928; * A documented assault on Dr Pattinson by Mrs Ballard in 1929, in response to verbal attack on Mr & Mrs Ballard by Dr Pattinson; and * A serious altercation between Curry and Dr Pattinson on Christmas Day 1929 (with allegation that issue was caused by supply of alcohol by Dr Pattinson to Aboriginal Nurse and patient); Then there were the numerous allegations of other categories of serious impropriety, including: * Theft of takings from Football, allegation made by Curry against Hoffman (substantiated and repayment made); * The 'Flogging' of an adult Aboriginal woman, Ren√© Harvey, by Curry, substantiated by Cameron SM, Curry advised by Under-Secretary Gall on 18 April 1929; and * Allegations serious sexual impropriety by Curry, by unnamed parties amongst both the white officials and Aboriginal residents; The report by Justice Nevitt regarding the administration of the Palm Island settlement, found that despite excessive drinking, bickering between Curry and Pattison, and the provision of alcohol to residents, that the management of the settlement was entirely adequate and acceptable. In releasing the Nevitt Report (after the tragedy), Queensland Premier Moore said that he was informed by his Home Department that the discipline at Palm Island had been good and management effective.  Incident  = 3 February 1930 = During the early morning hours of Monday, 3 February 1930, Robert Curry shot Dr. Pattison in the thigh and Dr. Pattison's wife in the neck. Using a form of dynamite called gelignite, he set fire to his own house, killing his step-daughter Edna Mather and son Robert Curry, Jr. He set fire twice to the office; and set fire to the thatch roof of the schoolhouse, the retail store, and the residence of the Assistant Superintendent Thomas Hoffman. Between 40 and 50 Aboriginal children were pupils of the burned school. At daylight Curry destroyed the supply launch Esme, and left in the second launch, the Rita, for Fantome Island. On Fantome Island he informed the Lock Hospital attendant Mr. Morcom of the events of the night and told him that he intended to lay the Rita off Curacoa Island and chase down any boat that left Palm Island. According to the hospital attendant he then intended to return to Palm Island and \\"clean off\\" the rest of the whites, then wait for the police boat to \\"have a bit of fun with them\\". Morcom believed that Curry was playing a practical joke, until a dinghy arrived to obtain his help and take him to Great Palm Island. Curry returned in the afternoon brandishing two firearms, when he was met on the beach by a small party of young Indigenous residents. He was shot four times: in the lower portion of the abdomen, upper portion of the thigh, and in each wrist. Curry was moved to the local hospital and attended to by Morcom, but died within two hours. = Shooting of Curry = Several young Aboriginal men, including Peter Prior, Harold Conway, Clive Beckett, Caeser Anning, Jimmy Harvey and Ellison Obah were provided with arms and sent down to the beach to patrol and await the return of Superintendent Curry from Fantome Island. These Aboriginal men had been given the responsibility of ensuring the safety of all on the Island, while the 'white men lay skulking and quaking in the bush.'Sir Raphael Cilento, Letter to Mrs P. Cilento, 30 September 1931, Townsville; cited in Watson 1994, p. 135. Assistant-Superintendent Hoffman is reported to have told Ellison Obah that 'I will give anyone ¬£1 to get Curry, and I will stand the responsibility.' Curry returned from Fantome Island on the Launch Esme, he was armed with a rifle and a revolver. Nobody challenged Curry on the Beach, so he proceeded to walk toward the settlement. At this point, he pointed the revolver toward the rear of the boatshed, directly at the position occupied by Peter Prior (who was armed with a shotgun with a magazine) and two other men, being Caeser Anning and Clive Beckett (both armed with rifles). Prior fired two shells from the shotgun, hitting Curry in the abdomen, chest, head and arms. > [Curry] was raising his hand with the revolver as if to take a shot when I > fired my shot gun and he fell and as I fired I heard another report > outside... I am certain that my shot hit him first and that caused him to > fall. I was afraid that he would have shot us all if I had not shot > first.Prior, P, 1930, 'Statement to Inquest into the Death of Robert Curry'; > Prior, P, 1930, Statement to Police, QSA; cited in Watson 1994, p. 136. Curry collapsed and dropped his weapons after being hit, he was given medical treatment, but died the next morning. An autopsy revealed that death had been caused by being hit by the wound to the abdomen. = Assistance arrives = Police and Dr. Taylor from Townsville were dispatched to Palm Island after the fact. The wounds to both Dr. Pattison and his wife had narrowly missed vital organs. Dr. Pattison had attended to his own wounds, and was later assisted by Mrs. Pattison and Morcom, who were commended by Dr. Taylor in the media. Dr. and Mrs. Pattison were moved to the Townsville Hospital. An estimate for the damage was ¬£7000. Arrangements were made in the following days for provisions to be supplied from Townsville to replace those destroyed on Palm Island.  Aftermath  = Curry's state of mind = Curry wrote letters on 2 February 1930, the first to Mr Bleakley (Chief Protector of Aboriginal Settlements) and to a Brisbane newspaper: In these letters, which were published in full in the Townsville Daily Bulletin on 3 March 1930, and which were provided to the second Cameron Inquiry as evidence, Superintendent Curry's state of mind immediately prior to the tragedy is readily apparent, most disturbingly he states in his letter to Mr Bleakley: > Dear Mr Bleakley, > This will be the last letter that ever you will receive from me, and I must > thank you and the heads of your department for the unjust treatment you have > dealt out to me in the past. > ... > I have no regrets about anything I have done to the doctor, and he deserves > all he gets. I was told by the so-called visiting Justice I could lay no > complaints against Fantome, as it was not in my department. That goes to > show things must go on unexposed. > ... > I know Gall will miss doctor. At any rate he can send a wreath along, as I > am going to revenge those who have injured me, and I will make them cry for > mercy. I am just as sane as you are, so don't think otherwise. > Kind regards, > > (signed) R.H. Curry (2 February 1930) Not only did Curry write what is apparently a suicide note attempt to justify in advance what he intended to do, he mentions dissatisfaction with the \\"visiting Justice\\" and the prospects of exposing the situation on the Island. Presumably he was referring to Justice Nivett, who was conducting an inquiry into allegations against Curry at that time, and whose report to the Secretary of Home Affairs was due to be handed down on 7 February 1930. It has been suggested that Curry was fearful that he should lose his position and his livelihood and that he had an unhealthy attachment to the Settlement. Curry feared that the outcome of the Nevitt Inquiry would be his removal from the Settlement and he blamed Assistant-Superintendent Hoffman, Under-Secretary Gall, and Dr Pattison (and the Matron ‚Äì Mrs Pattison) for his downfall. = Inquest= There was an immediate outcry about the situation on Palm Island and within the Home Secretary's Department, with several parties ‚Äì including the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League, calling for a full, open inquiry into the events. Speaking soon after the tragedy, Mr Gall, described the situation: > \\"In my opinion, Curry for some years had an obsession that he was to be > superseded in his position. This idea first took place when Mr. Hoffman was > appointed assistant superintendent, and the position was accentuated when > Dr. Patterson (sic) was appointed medical officer. Curry was most impulsive, > he would not tolerate interference by anybody on the staff on Palm Island, > and if they did interfere he was inclined to deal with them in a most > summary way. Curry did very fine work on Palm Island, but, after all, that > was his feeling that everybody was out to do him an injury. As a matter of > fact, nothing was further from the truth. Nobody wanted to hurt him. The Home Affairs Department held that given the completion of an inquiry that found Curry to be a competent manager on the same day he murdered his children and attempted to murder the doctor and his wife, there was no need for a full inquiry into the tragedy. The irony of this situation was described by Dr Joanne Watson, who examined the incident at length in her 1994 doctoral thesis: > Despite the seriousness of these charges and the further evidence provided > to Nevitt of bitter feuding amongst the administration on Palm, his report > argued that 'he found a high state of efficiency, both externally and > internally, in the administration of the settlement', and that 'the > management reflected the greatest credit on all concerned.' This must have > been one of the grimmest ironies in the history of Queensland, for on the > very day that this report reached the Home Office, Curry ran amok, clad in a > red bathing suit and armed with dynamite, petrol and revolvers he blew up > the reserves' main administrative buildings, set fire to the homes of other > officials, shot the doctor and his wife, set fire to the island and murdered > his own children. Magistrate Cameron PM, who had previously held an inquiry into the administration of the Island, decided to hold an Inquest into the death of Superintendent Curry. Despite the volumes of evidence provided and the need to examine 27 witnesses, this inquest was concluded on 28 March 1930, after sitting for only 28 hours all-told. On the basis of the evidence provided to the inquest by witnesses including Peter Prior, Clive Beckett, Caeser Anning, Jimmy Harvey and Ellison Obah, and the Police Magistrate, Cameron felt that there was sufficient evidence to take the matter to trial. =Arrests = = Evidence = As a result of the official inquiry into the three deaths, held in Townsville, on 15 April the Queensland Cabinet met and Attorney General MacGroarty announced that the Government would prosecute as murder the death of the Superintendent. In May, Pattison and Hoffman were charged with procuring indigenous resident Peter Prior to murder the Superintendent, as based on testimony from the foreman in charge of a sawmill on Palm Island and evidence given by the Aboriginal men who witnessed the events, in particular, that of Peter Prior himself, The wife of the storekeeper also testified against Hoffman, claiming that Hoffman offered \\"some boys\\" ¬£1 for the first to shoot or spear Curry. Pattison denied giving a gun to Prior, or anyone else, and also denied having done or said anything which would cause anyone to murder Curry. Assistant-Superintendent Hoffman also denied responsibility for arming the Aboriginal men, including Peter Prior, attempted to deny any knowledge that they were in fact armed, or that they intended to confront Superintendent Curry, that he had told them to do so and even suggested that the Aboriginal men had told him to leave and protect the women and children. Assistant-Superintendent denied having assured the group of Aboriginal men, when questioned as to what would happen to them if they did shoot Curry, = Trials = Although trial was initially set for Pattison on 11 August, on 19 July prosecutors declined to formally enter the murder charge and Pattison was freed.\\"No True Bill: Palm Island Tragedy, Dr. Pattison Freed\\", The Brisbane Courier, 19 July 1930, p.15 When the remaining matters, namely the Murder charge against Peter Prior and the charge of Procuring someone to commit murder against Hoffman, reached the Northern Supreme Court, Mr Justice Robert Douglas had the following discussion with the lead prosecutor, Mr Ross: > His Honor: The facts outlined by you, Mr. Ross, are this: Curry attempted to > kill the doctor and his wife, killed his children, burnt his house down, and > burnt Hoffman's house. > Mr. Ross: I will prove that Prior shot Curry, and that Hoffman offered a > pound to the first one who would do it. > > His Honor: If Hoffman shot Curry when he arrived, do you agree that he was > justified in doing so? > > Mr. Ross: Yes. > > His Honor: Then did you file a true bill because it was not a white man who > shot him? I'll tell the jury on your opening, Mr. Ross, that if a man > attacks the community as Curry did there, the community would be justified > in defending itself even to the extent of killing him. I don't think any > reasonable man could think otherwise. > > His Honor further stated that if a conviction was made at the trial the > Court of Criminal Appeal would quash the conviction. > > Mr. Ross: In that case, your Honor, I will file a nolle prosequi. > > His Honor: I think that is the best thing you can do. I don't think the > bill should ever have been filed. The defendants were released. This is a remarkable outcome for the period, the only other similar shooting was that of a police officer in Tuckiar v The King (1935),. in which the full court of the High Court of Australia overturned the guilty verdict of the NT Supreme Court (Mr Tuckiar vanished upon his release, and is presumed to have been killed by NT Police upon his release.  Later  Pattison resigned as medical officer at the Palm Island Aboriginal Settlement as of 15 September 1930.

William Dilworth (1791-1871) is credited with providing a school and teacher on Mt. Washington in the 1820s. Mary Parry Dilworth, widow of descendant John S. Dilworth later donated the land on which the Dilworth school was built. The architects, Martin U. Vrydaugh and Thomas B. Wolfe, also designed churches and homes for wealthy patrons, including the Calvary United Methodist Church. The school was designed three years after the Pittsburgh and Allegheny City school boards where merged. The building is brick, H shaped, two and one half stories high. It was a consciously elegant design, stylistically unique in the city when built, echoing European school designs. It included kindergarten and basement play spaces as were becoming essential at the time; but here the playrooms did not receive as much design attention as such elements would later on, and were not particularly functional. An auditorium was added in 1927 and was well designed for its intended use with a full stage, and directly accessible without entering the main portion of the school.

It is one of two confirmed vectors of citrus greening disease.Lallemand, J., A. Fos, and J. M. Bov√©. 1986. Transmission de la bacterie associ√© √† la forme africaine de la maladie du \\"greening\\" par le psylle asiatique Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. Fruits 41: 341-343. It has a wide distribution in southern Asia and has spread to other citrus growing regions. Distribution The Asian citrus psyllid originated in Asia but it is now also found in parts of the Middle East, South and Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. In the United States, the psyllid was first detected in Florida in 1998 and is now also found in Louisiana, Georgia, Arizona, South Carolina, and Texas . In Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, and Central Coast counties, such as San Luis Obispo, an eradication program has been instituted in an attempt to prevent it from becoming established.Center for Invasive Species ResearchCitrus Blight Triggers Alarm; California Confronts Incurable, Insect-Borne Tree-Killer That Makes Fruit Bitter April 15, 2012 In the whole of the United States and its territories, areas where this psyllid are found are under quarantine restrictions. Description Adult D. citri The adult psyllid is about four millimetres long with a fawn and brown mottled body and a light brown head. It is covered with a whitish, waxy secretion which makes it look dusty. The forewings are broadest at the back and have a dark edging around the periphery with a pale gap near the apex. The antennae are pale brown with black tips. These features distinguish it from the superficially similar African citrus psyllid. It typically adopts a head down, tail up posture as it sucks sap. Aphids are often also present on citrus and psyllids can be distinguished from them by being more active, jumping insects, whereas aphids are sedentary. In addition, the antennae of a psyllid has ten segments whereas those of aphids usually have four or six segments. Most aphids have cornicles on the abdomen and psyllids lack these. The psyllid nymph moults five times. It is a yellowish-orange color and has no abdominal spots. The wing pads are prominent, especially in the later instars. The eggs are approximately 0.3 millimeters long, almond-shaped, thicker at the base and tapering toward the top. They are at first a pale color but turn yellow and later orange before they hatch. The long axis is placed vertical to the surface of the leaf. Life cycle Eggs are laid on the tips of growing shoots, between and near the unfolding leaves. A female may lay up to 800 eggs during her lifetime which may be several months. The whole development cycle takes from two to seven weeks depending on the temperature and the time of year.Husain MA, Nath D. 1927. The citrus psylla (Diaphorina citri, Kuw.) (Psyllidae: Homoptera) Memoirs of the Department of Agriculture India 10: 1-27. Predation The wasps Brachygastra mellifica and Tamarixia radiata are a common parasitoids of D. citri. Lady beetles are also important predators. Damage Psyllid nymphs are found on new shoots of citrus trees. As they feed, they produce a toxin that causes the plant tips to die back or become contorted, preventing the leaves from expanding normally. However, direct damage from feeding by the psyllid is considered minor compared with the role the psyllid plays as the only known nonhuman vector of citrus greening disease. =Citrus greening disease= Feeding can vector bacteria that causes one of the most devastating of citrus diseases, citrus greening disease. Affected trees bear small, asymmetrical fruit which are partially green and which are unsellable because of their poor size and quality. Control The Asian citrus psyllid has a number of natural enemies including hoverflies, lacewings, several species of ladybird and a number of species of parasitic wasp.Waterston J. 1922. On the chalcidoid parasites of psyllids (Hemiptera, Homoptera). Bulletin of Entomological Research 13: 41-58. One of these wasps, Tamarixia radiata, has proved very effective at controlling the pest and has been successfully released and become established in a number of citrus growing areas including Florida.Hoy MA, Nguyen R. 2001. Classical biological control of Asian citrus psylla. Citrus Industry 81: 48-50. Both adults and nymphs of the psyllid can be controlled by the use of a wide range of insecticides. Citrus greening disease is best controlled through an integrated strategy involving the use of healthy planting material, the control of vectors, and the prompt removal of infected trees and branches. Recent efforts have focussed on understanding the various sensory cues that the psyllid uses to locate its host plant. Insight into the insect's behavior may lead to better methods for its control. One study demonstrated that perception of reflected ultraviolet wavelengths enhanced attraction to a yellow trap.George, J., T.M. Paris, S.A. Allan, S.L. Lapointe and L.L. Stelinski. 2020.

Formic and acetic acids in degradation products of plant volatiles elicit olfactory and behavioral responses from an insect vector of a major plant pathogen. Chemical Senses 41(4):325-338 It appears that this tiny insect is attracted by color (yellow and UV wavelengths) and decides to stay and feed on a particular plant only after alighting on a leaf and tasting it by probing with its mouthparts (stylets). Small molecules such as formic acid and acetic acid stimulate probing activity.George, J., D.G. Hall, S.L. Lapointe. 2016. A phagostimulant blend for the Asian citrus psyllid.

Plot summary The story is about a human tribe living in the distant future in a post-apocalyptic world, where a computer called the Great C has destroyed the world. Each year, the tribe sends a young man with three questions to the Great C, and if the computer cannot answer the questions, it will leave the tribe alone. On the other hand, if the computer can answer, the young man will be killed by the computer. A young man from the tribe is sent to the Great C, with three questions prepared by the wise men of the tribe. He reaches the Great C in a destroyed building in the ruins of a city. The man asks his questions, first, he asks where rain comes from. The Great C answers with ease. His two other questions (why doesn't the sun fall out of the sky? and How the world came to existence?) are also easily answered by the computer. The Great C then absorbs the man and uses his body as energy, awaiting next year, for the next young man. Meanwhile, the tribe prepares for next year, coming up with difficult questions.

As a process of transformation, theosis is brought about by the effects of catharsis (purification of mind and body) and theoria ('illumination' with the 'vision' of God). According to Eastern Christian teachings, theosis is very much the purpose of human life. It is considered achievable only through synergy (or cooperation) of human activity and God's uncreated energies (or operations). According to Metropolitan Hierotheos (Vlachos), the primacy of theosis in Eastern Orthodox Christian theology is directly related to the fact that Eastern Christian theology (as historically conceived by its principal exponents) is based to a greater extent than Latin Catholic theology on the direct spiritual insights of the saints or mystics of the church rather than the apparently more rational thought tradition of the West. Eastern Christians consider that \\"no one who does not follow the path of union with God can be a theologian\\" in the proper sense. Thus theology in Eastern Christianity is not treated primarily as an academic pursuit. Instead it is based on applied revelation (see gnosiology), and the primary validation of a theologian is understood to be a holy and ascetical life rather than intellectual training or academic credentials (see scholasticism). Deification Athanasius of Alexandria wrote, \\"He was incarnate that we might be made god\\" (Œë·ΩêœÑ·Ω∏œÇ Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ ·ºêŒΩŒ∑ŒΩŒ∏œÅœéœÄŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ, ·ºµŒΩŒ± ·º°ŒºŒµ·øñœÇ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÄŒøŒπŒ∑Œ∏·ø∂ŒºŒµŒΩ). His statement is an apt description of the doctrine. What would otherwise seem absurd‚Äîthat fallen, sinful man may become holy as God is holy‚Äîhas been made possible through Jesus Christ, who is God incarnate. Naturally, the crucial Christian assertion, that God is One, sets an absolute limit on the meaning of theosis: even as it is not possible for any created being to become God ontologically, or even a necessary part of God (of the three existences of God called hypostases), so a created being cannot become Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit nor the Father of the Trinity. Most specifically creatures, i.e. created beings, cannot become God in His transcendent essence, or ousia, hyper-being (see apophaticism). Such a concept would be the henosis, or absorption and fusion into God of Greek pagan philosophy. However, every being and reality itself is considered as composed of the immanent energy, or energeia, of God. As energy is the actuality of God, i.e. his immanence, from God's being, it is also the energeia or activity of God. Thus the doctrine avoids pantheism while partially accepting Neoplatonism's terms and general concepts, but not its substance (see Plotinus). Maximus the Confessor wrote: Theoria Through theoria (illumination with or direct experience of the Triune God), human beings come to know and experience what it means to be fully human, i.e., the created image of God; through their communion with Jesus Christ, God shares himself with the human race, in order to conform them to all that He is in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. As God became human, in all ways except sin, he will also make humans \\"God\\", i.e., \\"holy\\" or \\"saintly\\", in all ways except his Divine Essence, which is uncaused and uncreated. Irenaeus explained this doctrine in the work Against Heresies, Book 5, Preface: \\"the Word of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who did, through His transcendent love, become what we are, that He might bring us to be even what He is Himself.\\" As a patristic and historical teaching For many Church Fathers, theosis goes beyond simply restoring people to their state before the fall of Adam and Eve, teaching that because Christ united the human and divine natures in Jesus' person, it is now possible for someone to experience closer fellowship with God than Adam and Eve initially experienced in the Garden of Eden, and that people can become more like God than Adam and Eve were at that time. Some Eastern Christian theologians say that Jesus would have become incarnate for this reason alone, even if Adam and Eve had never sinned. All of humanity is fully restored to the full potential of humanity because the Son of God took to himself a human nature to be born of a woman, and takes to himself also the sufferings due to sin (yet is not himself sinful, and is God unchanged in being). In Christ the two natures of God and human are not two persons but one; thus a union is effected in Christ between all of humanity in principle and God. So the holy God and sinful humanity are reconciled in principle in the one sinless man, Jesus Christ. (See Jesus' prayer as recorded in John 17.) This reconciliation is made actual through the struggle to conform to the image of Christ. Without the struggle, the praxis, there is no real faith; faith leads to action, without which it is dead. One must unite will, thought, and action to God's will, his thoughts, and his actions. A person must fashion his life to be a mirror, a true likeness of God. More than that, since God and humanity are more than a similarity in Christ but rather a true union, Christians' lives are more than mere imitation and are rather a union with the life of God himself: so that the one who is working out salvation is united with God working within the penitent both to will and to do that which pleases God (Philippians 2:13). A common analogy for theosis, given by the Greek fathers, is that of a metal which is put into the fire. The metal obtains all the properties of the fire (heat, light), while its essence remains that of a metal. Using the head-body analogy from Paul the Apostle, every man in whom Christ lives partakes of the glory of Christ. As John Chrysostom observes, \\"where the head is, there is the body also. There is no interval to separate between the Head and the body; for were there a separation, then were it no longer a body, then were it no longer a head.\\" Stages Theosis is understood to have three stages: first, the purgative way, purification, or katharsis; second, illumination, the illuminative way, the vision of God, or theoria; and third, sainthood, the unitive way, or theosis. Thus the term \\"theosis\\" describes the whole process and its objective. By means of purification a person comes to theoria and then to theosis. Theosis is the participation of the person in the life of God. According to this doctrine, the holy life of God, given in Jesus Christ to the believer through the Holy Spirit, is expressed through the three stages of theosis, beginning in the struggles of this life, increasing in the experience of knowledge of God, and consummated in the resurrection of the believer, when the victory of God over fear, sin, and death, accomplished in the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, is made manifest in the believer forever. Ascetic practice The journey toward theosis includes many forms of praxis, the most obvious being monasticism and clergy. Of the monastic tradition, the practice of hesychasm is most important as a way to establish a direct relationship with God. Living in the community of the church and partaking regularly of the sacraments, especially the Eucharist, is taken for granted. Also important is cultivating \\"prayer of the heart\\", and prayer that never ceases, as Paul exhorts in 1 Thessalonians 5:17. This unceasing prayer of the heart is a dominant theme in the writings of the Fathers, especially in those collected in the Philokalia. It is considered that no one can reach theosis without an impeccable Christian living, crowned by faithful, warm, and, ultimately, silent, continuous Prayer of the Heart. The \\"doer\\" in deification is the Holy Spirit, with whom the human being joins his will to receive this transforming grace by praxis and prayer, and as Gregory Palamas teaches, the Christian mystics are deified as they become filled with the Light of Tabor of the Holy Spirit in the degree that they make themselves open to it by asceticism (divinization being not a one-sided act of God, but a loving cooperation between God and the advanced Christian, which Palamas considers a synergy). This synergeia or co-operation between God and Man does not lead to mankind being absorbed into the God as was taught in earlier pagan forms of deification like henosis. Rather it expresses unity, in the complementary nature between the created and the creator. Acquisition of the Holy Spirit is key as the acquisition of the Spirit leads to self-realization. Western attitudes Western attitudes towards theosis have traditionally been negative. In his article, Bloor highlights various Western theologians who have contributed to what he calls a \\"stigma\\" towards theosis. Yet, recent theological discourse has seen a reversal of this, with Bloor drawing upon Western theologians from an array of traditions, whom, he claims, embrace theosis/deification. The practice of ascetic prayer, called Hesychasm in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches, \\"is centered on the enlightenment or deification (... or theosis, in Greek) of man\\". Hesychasm is directed to a goal that is not limited to natural life alone and goes beyond this to deification (theosis). In the past, Roman Catholic theologians generally expressed a negative view of Hesychasm. The doctrine of Gregory Palamas won almost no following in the West, and the distrustful attitude of Barlaam in its regard prevailed among Western theologians, surviving into the early 20th century, as shown in Adrian Fortescue's article on hesychasm in the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia. Fortescue translated the Greek words and as \\"quiet\\" and \\"quietist\\". In the same period, Edward Pace's article on quietism indicated that, while in the strictest sense quietism is a 17th-century doctrine proposed by Miguel de Molinos, the term is also used more broadly to cover both Indian religions and what Edward Pace called \\"the vagaries of Hesychasm\\", thus betraying the same prejudices as Fortescue with regard to hesychasm; and, again in the same period, Sim√©on Vailh√© described some aspects of the teaching of Palamas as \\"monstrous errors\\", \\"heresies\\" and \\"a resurrection of polytheism\\", and called the hesychast method for arriving at perfect contemplation \\"no more than a crude form of auto-suggestion\\". Different concepts of \\"natural contemplation\\" existed in the East and in the medieval West. The twentieth century saw a remarkable change in the attitude of Roman Catholic theologians to Palamas, a \\"rehabilitation\\" of him that has led to increasing parts of the Western Church considering him a saint, even if uncanonized. Some Western scholars maintain that there is no conflict between Palamas's teaching and Roman Catholic thought. According to G. Philips, the essence‚Äìenergies distinction is \\"a typical example of a perfectly admissible theological pluralism\\" that is compatible with the Roman Catholic magisterium. Jeffrey D. Finch claims that \\"the future of East‚ÄìWest rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism\\". Some Western theologians have incorporated the theology of Palamas into their own thinking. Pope John Paul II said Catholics should be familiar with \\"the venerable and ancient tradition of the Eastern Churches\\", so as to be nourished by it.

It is a tagma, i.e., a specialized grouping of arthropod segments. The word cephalon derives from the Greek Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ (kephalƒì), meaning \\"head\\". Insects In insects, head is a preferred term. The insect head consists of five segments, including three (the labial, maxillary and mandibular) necessary for food uptake, which are altogether known as the gnathocephalon and house the suboesophageal ganglion of the brain, as well as the antennal segment, and an ocular segment, as well as a non segmented fused section of the head where the archicerebrum is housed known as the acron. see also arthropod head problem. Chelicerates and crustaceans In chelicerates and crustaceans, the cephalothorax is derived from the fusion of the cephalon and the thorax, and is usually covered by a single unsegmented carapace. In relation with the arthropod head problem, phylogeny studies show that members of the Malacostraca class of crustaceans have five segments in the cephalon, when not fused with the thorax to form a cephalothorax. Proarticulata In the Late Precambrian or Lower Cambrian Proarticulata species Praecambridium sigillum, that superficially resembles a trilobite, the term is also used to describe the anterior part of the animal. Thylacocephala The head of the Thylacocephala is also referred to as a cephalon. Thylacocephala are a unique group of extinct arthropods, with possible crustacean affinities, thought to occur from the lower Cambrian, but with certainty between the Lower Silurian and the Upper Cretaceous. Trilobites tagmata in a trilobite Cephalon of the trilobite Phacops rana from the Devonian of northwestern Ohio. The cephalon of trilobites is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The glabella, the expression of the axial lobe in the cephalon, forms a dome underneath which sat the \\"crop\\" or \\"stomach\\". Generally the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the hypostome, a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backwards at the rear edge of the hypostome. Hypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un- mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described.Fortey, 1990 The size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon, together with hypostome variation, have been linked to different lifestyles, diets and specific ecological niches.Fortey, 2004 The lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly exaggerated in the Harpetida, in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch. Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon. =Facial sutures= When trilobites moulted, the librigenae (\\"free cheeks\\") separated along the facial suture to assist moulting, leaving the cranidium (glabella + fixigenae) exposed. Trilobite facial sutures can be roughly divided into three main types (proparian, gonatoparian, and opisthoparian) according to where the sutures end relative to the genal angle (the edges where the side and rear margins of the cephalon converge). Early Cambrian trilobites belonging to the suborder Olenellina (like Fallotaspis) lacked facial sutures. Other later trilobites also lost facial sutures secondarily.

Life Ashby was born in Red Lion Street, Clerkenwell, London in 1724. Educated at Croydon, Westminster, and Eton, he entered St John's College, Cambridge, on 30 October 1740, and took the degree of B.A., in 1744, of M.A. in 1748, when he was admitted fellow of St John's, and of B.D. in 1756. He was presented by a relative to the rectory of Hungerton, in Leicestershire, in 1754, and in 1759 to that of Twyford in the same county; he held both benefices in conjunction until 1767, when he resigned the former, and in 1769 he gave up the latter on his election to the presidency or vice-mastership of St John's College. About 1775, when he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, he appears to have resigned his official connection with Cambridge, where he supported academic reform too vigorously to obtain further preferment. Among other changes, he advocated the right of the fellows to marry. At the same time he accepted the college living of Barrow, Suffolk, to which John Ross, the bishop of Exeter, an intimate friend and patron of Ashby, added the rectory of Stansfield in 1780. In 1793 his sight began to fail, and shortly afterwards he became totally blind. He died of paralysis at Barrow on 12 June 1808, and was buried in the parish church, where a monument was erected to his memory. Works Although Ashby published little, his varied learning was the admiration of the best known literary antiquaries of the 18th century, all of whom he reckoned among his friends. He was intimate for some years with the poet Thomas Gray, and portions of his voluminous correspondence with Bishop Percy, Richard Gough, John Nichols, William Herbert, and the Rev. James Granger, were printed in John Nichols' Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century and in Granger's Letters. He dealt with a wide range of antiquarian topics there; in one letter he proposed an emendation of a line in Hamlet, in another he pointed out errors in the Biographia Britannica, which he had read from end to end, and in a third he discussed some vexed questions of numismatics. He was a regular contributor to the Gentleman's Magazine; he added notes to Nichols's Literary Anecdotes under the initials of T. F. (Dr. Taylor's Friend); he greatly aided Nichols in his History of Leicestershire, to which he contributed an elaborate essay on the Roman Milliary at Leicester; and he gave material assistance to Daines Barrington, when preparing his Observations on the Statutes. He published a dissertation on a coin of Nerva newly discovered at Colchester in Archaeologia. Some volumes of his manuscript collections, together with numerous letters on antiquarian themes, are preserved among the Cole, Egerton, and Additional manuscripts at the British Library. They include notes on archery, an essay on parish registers, and extracts and notes on old English and French plays, of which the English plays are mainly early 16th-century interludes. His valuable library, which was bequeathed to Thomas Lyus, his amanuensis, was sold soon after his death to a bookseller at Bury, and was rapidly dispersed.

It was a twin engine, high wing, metal frame monoplane, distinguished by a very thick centre section wing which formed the forward fuselage and housed the engines. Design In 1925 the well-established naval ship builders Soci√©t√© Anonyme de Travaux Dyle et Bacalan, based in Bordeaux, developed an aircraft manufacturing interest. Their first production was a high wing, twin engine heavy bomber, the DB-10. Like their later aircraft, the DB-10 was structurally an all-metal machine. In most respects the DB-10 was a conventional design for its day but it had one feature, a very thick wing centre section blended into the fuselage, which was also to become a characteristic of later Dyle et Bacalan aircraft. At the front of the DB-10 the thick aerofoil centre section stretched unbroken between the engines, which were mounted upon it. Beyond the engines outer wings of normal thickness and constant chord, significantly thinner and narrower than the inboard section, were each supported by a pair of parallel struts to the lower edge of the centre section. Wing spars and struts were made of steel tubing, with duralumin ribs. A conventional, rectangular section, fuselage with duralumin longerons emerged from the centre section as the thick aerofoil thinned, carrying a tailplane on its upper surface, braced from below. It also carried a single fin and a deep rudder, which moved in a cut-out between the elevators. All surfaces, except those housing the uncowled Gnome-built Bristol Jupiter radial engines, were fabric. The DB-10 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with each single, partly cowled, mainwheel mounted on a parallel pair of V-shaped struts behind the engines. The outer pair of struts was fixed close to the lower ends of the wing struts, at the edge of the thick aerofoil. A tailwheel was mounted at the rear of the fuselage, just in front of the rudder. The thick centre section enclosed vertical bomb racks as well as fuel tanks. Open cockpits for the crew were built on top of it, starting with a navigator/bombardier's or gunner's position at the extreme leading edge. Immediately behind but stepped above it was the pilot's cockpit, with another cockpit just aft where the raised crew housing ended. There was a separate dorsal gunner's position, fitted with a gun ring, on the fuselage proper. Operational history The DB-10 was entered into the 1926 French government BN3 competition for a new three man night bomber, held at Villacoublay where it flew against such aircraft as the Amiot 122, the Farman F.123, the Lat√©co√®re 19 and the eventual winner the Lior√© et Olivier L√©O 20. Only one DB-10 was built, though the company persisted with the thick wing idea in its later DB-70 transport aircraft.

The film focuses on the daily sexual harassment of women in public places and events in Egypt. The film took the Top Prize in the 2010 Dubai International Film Festival, Muhr Arab category.  Plot  The film focuses on the lives of three women of different social classes who get publicly harassed. It starts with Fayza (Bushra), a low income government employee who gets harassed in a taxi and a bus (numbered 678) on the way to work. When she arrives home she resists her husband's attempts in sleeping with her and doesn't explain why she can't sleep with him. It then moves to Seba a middle class jewelry designer who gets harassed in a stadium by a group of men while her husband is unable to reach her to stop what is happening to her. Following that, her husband was unable to live with what happened and she was left with no one to take care of her emotionally. She separated from her husband and started a harassment class in al Sawi cultural wheel. Finally the movie focuses on Nelly, a standup comedian and call center employee who gets harassed verbally on a call with a customer as well as physically while walking home when a truck driver grabs her and pulls her through the street. When he finally leaves her she runs behind the truck and doesn't let it go until she and the crowds were able to pull the driver out and hand him over to the police. She tries to file a report for harassment but the police officer resists and sends her to another precinct. She appears after that on a TV show as the first Egyptian to file a report for harassment.

Attorney Abdel Hamid Shabaan made an attempt to block the film's exhibition in the Dubai International Film Festival due to its \\"poor portrayal\\" of Egypt. The filmmaker denied any intention to defame Egypt, as he believes the issues narrated in the film are universal. Mahmoud Hanfy Mahmoud of the Association for Human rights and Social Justice requested that the film be banned as potentially inciting women to injure men's genitals with sharp tools, but filmmakers argued that it did not encourage but merely documented the practice of some women carrying such tools for self-defense.

Zak Starkey later replaced Spence on drums. The band recorded one album, Powerbill, which was released in Japan. After being dropped by their record label shortly after recording the album, the band members at the time (Powers, Owsley, and Starkey) all went on to successful careers in the music industry. Powers has performed as a bassist with Ben Folds and the Counting Crows and has worked as a record engineer and producer. Owsley had a successful solo career before his death in 2010. Starkey has served as the drummer for the bands Oasis and The Who.  History  Jody Spence and Owsley began writing songs after a couple of years of touring with Judson Spence, Jody's brother. Jody and Owsley soon got publishing contracts with Sony Music Publishing which were facilitated by Scott Siman in 1990. In 1991, Siman attended a show in North Carolina where a band called Majosha performed, which featured Ben Folds and Millard Powers. Not long after that, Siman brought Folds to Nashville and Powers later followed. Siman furnished a small demo studio that the Spence brothers, Owsley and Folds would often share. Folds would eventually introduce Millard Powers to Jody Spence and Owsley. Within a month of meeting each other, Spence, Powers and Owsley had written and recorded entire albums worth of songs at the Sony Tree studio, 7 of which would later end up on the Geffen Records album Powerbill. The trio played a few shows in and around Nashville under the names \\"Spence Powers Owsley\\" and \\"Parade\\" with Folds sitting in on keys sometimes. The name \\"Jody's Powerbill\\", often confused with \\"The Semantics\\", was a name that Folds had suggested for the trio which they didn't use. Folds used the name himself for a while before becoming Ben Folds Five. After a trip to Los Angeles and changing their name to \\"The Semantics\\", the trio developed a buzz within the major labels which eventually brought John Kalodner of Geffen Records to Nashville, Tennessee for a showcase and the band ended up signing with him. In the search for a producer, tensions grew between the three and Jody Spence ended up leaving the band. Spence was eventually replaced by drummer Zak Starkey, Ringo Starr's son. A producer was eventually found in Peter Asher, under whose tutelage the band members worked for four years on the album Powerbill, a process which had taught the band members much about the production process and about management. Powerbill was initially slated for release in 1993, but was never released in the U.S for being \\"too pop for alternative and too alternative for pop.\\"Everything2 (February 7, 2001). Owsley.

Although suddenly being dropped from the label initially left the members of the band members destitute and broke, all band members have overcome this shock and continued to pursue a career in music, while also paying tribute to The Semantics. In 1999, Owsley re-recorded the \\"Coming Up Roses\\" for his eponymous first solo album Owsley. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album. Millard Powers' 2001 solo album featured \\"Jenny Won't Play Fair\\", a re-recording of the song off Powerbill. Powers, Starkey and Spence continue to perform and record.

Beginnings In July 1947 the London County Council (LCC) declared Bermondsey a Reconstruction Area, and as part of wholesale post-war regeneration approved the idea of extending Southwark Park to the river. The idea of a link to the river pre-dated the Second World war by a few years, but the post-war need to reconstruct gave this aim more resonance. In January 1948 the LCC Planning Committee endorsed the policy of a park by the river at King's Stairs riverside. Putting the policy into practice proved to be a slow business because of a combination of objections by amongst others Bermondsey Borough Council and local businesses. For instance in 1953 the LCC's Draft Development Plan for London was subject to an Inquiry and the Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Chamber of Commerce objected to the park extension. In September 1954 the Ministry of Housing approved the compulsory purchase of land in order to extend the park, but this took a few years to implement. In 1960 the LCC approved a design for the King's Stairs riverside walk, which was opened in November 1962. In January 1963 the LCC approved the name King's Stairs Gardens. In 1964 the LCC agreed a grassed area to the south of The Angel public house. Again the implementation seems to have been delayed due to financial constraints, and it was not until 1968 that the Greater London Council (the successor body to the LCC) reappraised the site, and agreed to three green space additions. These were finally completed by 1982, and it is in that form that King's Stairs Gardens still exists today. So from an approval in 1947 it took only another 35 years to fully achieve! Queen Elizabeth II's Jubilee 1977 For the 1977 25th Jubilee of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II a memorial stone was unveiled by Her Majesty on the banks of the River Thames in King's Stairs Gardens. To coincide with the Summer 2002 restoration works in nearby Southwark Park, a new memorial stone was unveiled in King's Stairs Gardens by the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Conservation and Thames Water plans Thames Water named the park in September 2010 as one possible site for works as part of the planned construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel, but following a consultation process and a vigorous local campaign (\\"the Save King's Stairs Gardens Campaign), Thames Water decided against using the site, choosing Chambers Wharf instead. The park was also given village green status in March 2012 by Southwark Council under the Commons Act 2006, a move which reduces the likelihood of any future such threat.

By observing and recording the beam pattern, for example, one can infer the spatial mode properties of the beam and whether or not the beam is being clipped by an obstruction; By focusing the laser beam with a lens and measuring the minimum spot size, the number of times diffraction limit or focusing quality can be computed. Anthony E. Siegman was the first to propose the formalism for a laser beam quality factor that could be measured and used to compare different beams, independent of wavelength. The factor is called M2, and it is closely related to the beam parameter product. While the M2 factor does not give detail on the spatial characteristics of the beam, it does indicate how close it is to being a fundamental-mode Gaussian beam. It also determines the smallest spot size for the beam, as well as the beam divergence. M2 can also give an indication of beam distortions due to, for example, power-induced thermal lensing in the laser gain medium, since it will increase. There are some limitations to the M2 parameter as a simple quality metric. It can be difficult to measure accurately, and factors such as background noise can create large errors in M2. Tutorial presentation at the Optical Society of America Annual Meeting, Long Beach, California Beams with power well out in the \\"tails\\" of the distribution have M2 much larger than one would expect. In theory, an idealized tophat laser beam has infinite M2, although this is not true of any physically realizable tophat beam. For a pure Bessel beam, one cannot even compute M2. The definition of \\"quality\\" also depends on the application. While a high-quality single-mode Gaussian beam (M2 close to unity) is optimum for many applications, for other applications a uniform multimode tophat beam intensity distribution is required. An example is laser surgery. Power-in-the-bucket and Strehl ratio are two other attempts to define beam quality. Both these methods use a Laser beam profiler to measure how much power is delivered to a given area. There is also no simple conversion between M2, power-in-the-bucket, and Strehl ratio. M2 definitions M2 definition The equation for the divergence, of a pure Gaussian TEM00 unfocused beam propagating through space is given by :Theta_{00}={4lambda over pi D_{00}}, (1) where D00 is the diameter of the beam waist, and Œª is the wavelength. Higher mode beams often start with a larger beam waist, D0, and/or have a faster divergence Œò0. In this case Equation (1) becomes :Theta_0=M^2 {4lambda over pi D_0}, (2) where Œò0 and D0 are the divergence and waist of a higher mode beam and M2 is greater than 1 and is named the \\"Beam Propagation Ratio\\" per the ISO 11146 standard. When a Gaussian laser beam is focused, the focused spot diameter is defined by :d_{00}={4lambda f over pi D_{00}}, (3) where d00 is the ideal focused spot diameter, f is the focal length of the focusing lens, and D00 is the input beam waist and is placed one focal length from the lens as shown in the figure. However, when a multimode beam is focused, Equation (3) becomes :d_0=M^2 {4lambda f over pi D_0}. (4) M2 measurement M2 cannot be determined from a single beam profile measurement. The ISO/DIS 11146 define that M2 should be calculated from a series of measurements as shown in the figure below.ISO 11146:2005(E), \\"Lasers and laser-related equipment ‚Äî Test methods for laser beam widths, divergence angles and beam propagation ratios\\". M2 is measured on real beams by focusing the beam with a fixed position lens of known focal length, and then measuring the characteristics of the beam waist and divergence. These measurements can be taken with a laser beam profiler.G. Langer et al., A webcam in Bayer-mode as a light beam profiler for the near infra-red, Optics and Lasers in Engineering 51 (2013) 571‚Äì575 Measurement positions for obtaining M2 The multiple measurements ensure that the minimum beam diameter is found and enable a \\"curve fit\\" that improves the accuracy of the calculation by minimizing measurement error.

Biography Artist/photographer Nancy Burson's work is shown in museums and galleries internationally. \\"Seeing and Believing\\", her traveling 2002 retrospective originating at the Grey Art Gallery, was nominated for Best Solo Museum Show of the Year in New York City by the International Association of Art Critics. She has served as a visiting professor at Harvard and was a member of the adjunct photography faculty at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for five years. Her work is included in museums worldwide including the MoMA, Metropolitan Museum, and the Whitney Museum in New York City, as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Center Georges Pompidou in Paris, the LA County Museum of Art, MoMA (San Francisco), the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC, as well as many others. Burson is best known for her work in morphing technologies which age enhance the human face and still enable law enforcement officials to locate missing children and adults. Her Human Race Machine, which allows people to view themselves as a different race, is used worldwide as an educational diversity tool that provides viewers with the visual experience of being another race. The Human Race Machine Burson‚Äôs invention, The Human Race Machine, was inspired by a meeting in mid-1998 with one of Zaha Hadid's staff. It made its debut at the Mind Zone in the London Millennium Dome on January 1, 2000Zaha Hadid, Mind Zone at London's Millennium Dome and it was seen by millions of people during that year. Set in the futuristic environment of Zaha‚Äôs Mind Zone, there were four machines and wait lines of sometimes two hours long to use the all new, race morphing technology that had been developed throughout 1999. The Human Race Machine was conceived as an interactive tool for the resolution of humanity‚Äôs racial issues. Several other interactive machines had already been developed in the late 1980s. These were based on commissions from science museums as well as concepts from the patent that was issued to Nancy Burson in 1981 called ‚ÄúThe Method and Apparatus for Producing an Image of a Person‚Äôs Face at a Different Age.‚Äù A few years later, that patent became the basis for morphing technology for the entire computer graphics industry. A Composite Machine that showed the viewer what they might look like with their face melded with a celebrity had been developed by a science museum from that patent. An Age Machine showed viewers what they might look like when older and had been shown in art museums as early as 1990. That same technology had also been used to find children and adults that had been missing for many years. The software was acquired by the FBI and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. In 1986, several children were found and returned home using computer generated updates after national TV shows covered the updating process (Missing II, Have You Seen This Person, NBC Special, and Missing III, Have You Seen This Person, NBC Special). Collaboration Burson has collaborated with Creative Time,Creative Time Archives, Nancy Burson the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (LMCC), and Deutsche Bank in completing several public art projects in New York City. These include the poster project Visualize This (Creative Time, 1991), the billboard ‚ÄúThere's No Gene For Race\\" (2000), the poster/postcard project \\"Focus on Peace\\" which coincided with the first anniversary of 9/11, and ‚ÄúLooking Up‚Äù and ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù, 2005.

When Severinus refused, Heraclius in turn refused to recognise him as Pope, and sent his chartoularios (secretary) Maurikios to Rome to obtain the Pope‚Äôs agreement to the Ecthesis. After his arrival, Maurikios, with the support of the local Roman militia, occupied the Lateran and plundered the papal palace. The Exarch Isaac also rushed to Rome and seized the Lateran treasure for the emperor, although he and Maurikios retained a significant portion for themselves. As a result, for almost two years Severinus was denied access to his office. In 643, Maurikios, now the dux of Rome, attempted to repeat his successful action, but this time he was determined to not share any of the plunder with anyone. He revolted against Isaac, and declared Rome‚Äôs independence from the Exarchate and from the emperor, Constans II (r. 641‚Äì668). In response, Isaac dispatched his magister militum Donus, who crushed the revolt. Maurikios sought sanctuary in the church of Saint Maria ad Praesepe, but he was dragged from the church and sent in chains to Ravenna and beheaded.

History By 1903, the anarchist Mihail Gerdzhikov was elected as a commander of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation's armed guerrilla wing in Thrace, the so-called Mortal Combat Body which helped stage a revolt against the Ottomans in Adrianople Vilayet. In the Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising Gerdzhikov's forces about 2,000 strong, facing a Turkish garrison of 10,000 well-armed troops, managed to establish a liberated zone in the Strandzha Mountains, centered in Vasiliko. This successful mass uprising, supported by militia, allowed the rebels to capture most of East Thrace, settling in Malko Tarnovo. The population of the region celebrated victory for three weeks. In the region, under the influence of the anarcho-communist views of Gerdzhikov and the leadership of the Odrinsk revolutionary district, a new communal management system was established where all issues were resolved by mutual agreements between the Bulgarians and Greeks. The economy of the Strandzha Commune was based on anarcho-communist principles. Most of the labor force was composed of women, who worked in the farms as men became guerilla fighters. The Turkish government was surprised by the uprising, taking extraordinary military measures to suppress it. The Ottomans managed to destroy the Strandzha Republic, committing atrocities against the rebel forces and the local population.

This book is in three volumes, and appears to be about magic‚Äîspecifically, about using spirits to communicate over long distances. However, since the publication of a decryption key to the first two volumes in 1606, they have been known to be actually concerned with cryptography and steganography. Until recently, the third volume was widely still believed to be solely about magic, but the \\"magical\\" formulae have now been shown to be covertexts for yet more cryptographic content. Reception Mentions of the magical work within the third book by such figures as Agrippa and John Dee still lend credence to the idea of a mystic-magical foundation concerning the third volume.Goodrick- Clarke, Nicholas, The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction (Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 50-55Walker, D.

The massive fortified complex is just to the southwest of the modern Turkish town of Kozan in Adana Province. History In the 3rd millennium B.C. Sis was one of the Hittite settlements on the Cilician plain between the mountains and the Mediterranean coast. During the 1st century B.C. Sis appears to have been an unfortified village in the Roman province of Cilicia Secunda. The names Sisan or Sisia are first mentioned in the 5th and 6th centuries in Greek and Latin sources. In 703-04 A.D. the Byzantine settlers repulsed an Arab attack, but were soon forced to abandon the town, which became a frontier post for the Abbasid Caliphate. The Caliph al-Mutawakkil reconstructed the Byzantine defenses in the mid-9th century. The Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas recaptured Sis in 962, only to have it become an Armenian possession in 1113, when it was occupied by Rubenid Baron T‚Äõoros I and repaired. From the late 12th through the 13th centuries the castle was significantly enlarged during the reigns of King Levon I and King Het‚Äõum I with a \\"palace,\\" residential buildings, churches, and gardens. Wilbrand von Oldenburg, a Teutonic monk who visited Sis in 1212, found a complete and well-established capital. Het‚Äõum's wife, Zapƒìl, is credited with building a hospital there in 1241. A fragment of a dedicatory inscription still in situ within the castle mentions \\"Het‚Äõum.\\" After Hromkla was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks, Sis became the Catholicos' residence. In 1266 the Mamluks looted and burnt the city. In 1275 the Mamluks again surrounded the city, but were defeated by Armenian forces. A century later, in 1369 the Mamluks again conquered the city, but were forced to leave. Finally, in 1375 the Mamluks took the city, looted and burnt it, and captured the king and many lords. With Sis fallen also fell the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. According to Gregory of Akner, Into the early 20th century Armenians continued to inhabit the town where several late medieval residential structures were preserved.Robert W. Edwards, \\"Settlements and Toponymy in Armenian Cilicia,\\" Revue des √âtudes Arm√©niennes 24, 1993, pp.201-03. The castle at Sis is one of the largest fortified sites in the Levant. If laid from end to end, the circuit walls would measure almost 3 kilometers in length. The walls, towers, vaulted undercrofts, cisterns, and residential buildings are carefully adapted into the folds of the lofty outcrop of limestone. The vast majority of these constructions are built with well-cut rusticated ashlar, a masonry typical of Armenian fortifications. There are fragments of Byzantine walls as well as an entrance corridor at the southeast which was built during the Mamluk occupation and has an inscription in Arabic. Because of its strategic location, Sis has indivisibility with the castles at Andƒ±l, Anazarbus, and Tumlu. Directly below the castle outcrop at the southeast is a large terrace which has the remains of several important churches and chapels in the Compound of the Patriarchs, including the basilica of St. Sophia, built by King Het‚Äõum I, and the 18th-century church of St. Gregory the Illuminator. One of the chapels, Kara Kilise, still preserves the apse and the pointed vault over the nave.Robert W.

It stars Amitabh Bachchan, Jackie Shroff, Nagarjuna milind soman and Raveena Tandon, with music composed by Sandesh Shandilya and Taufiq Qureshi. The film is a silver screen adaptation of Girish Karnad's Mahabharat play The Fire and The Rain. The film's art direction was handled by Shashidhar Adapa and Choreography was handled by Prabhu Deva.Review Bollywood Hungama Plot In a kingdom stricken with drought for many years, Arvasu (Milind Soman), a brahman loves Nittilai (Sonali Kulkarni) a tribal girl, who seeks approval of her father and village's elders before marrying him. Arvasu's brother, Paravasu (Jackie Shroff) has been conducting a major fire sacrifice, the yajna ceremony, for seven long years to appease the god of rains, Devraj (Amitabh Bachchan). Arvasu's father, Raibhya dislikes both his sons and suspects Vishaka (Raveena Tandon) Parvasu's wife, of having an affair with Yavakri (Nagarjuna), based on the fact that Yavarki and Vishaka loved each other, before Yavarki left village to worship Devraj Indra in order to attain Brahma Jnana, supreme divine powers. After his return, Yavakri tries pursues Vishakha regularly on her way from the well. She, at first, refuses him but ultimately gives up and they start making love in the woods. Nittilai and Aravasu see them. Yavakri detests Nittilai's frankness and her doubts as to his divine powers. He curses her to die within a month. Upon reaching home, on being accused of adultery by Raibhya, Vishakha enraged tells him that she was with Yavakri. An enraged Raibhya summons a dark force, Brahma Rakshas (Prabhu Deva) to kill Yavarki. He also declares that Yavakri can save himself if he enters the ashram of his father, this shall declare him as a coward. Yavakri, wanting to prove his strength waits for the demon to arrive. Vishakha warns him and tells him to flee to his father's ashram, which would allow both him and Riabhya to live; otherwise, if Yavakri defeats the Brahma Rakshas, Raibhya would have to immolate himself. But Yavakri refuses to be defensive and a dispute of distrust erupts between Yavakri and Vishakha, leading to an act of defiance by Vishakha. The demon slays Yavakri as he now runs to seek refuge in his father's ashram. Vishakha pleads Arvasu to cremate him; this delays his appointment with Nittilai's father and her village elders, and, as a result, she is forced to marry a fellow tribesman. Parvasu sneaks in the night to meet Vishakha. Vishakha confesses everything and begs him to kill her, but Paravasu raises the arrow and shoots at his father. On his way back to yajna site, he is met by the demon, who calls him brother and as a cursed soul seeks salvation at his hands, but Paravasu rudely ignores him. The next day when Aravasu comes to the yajna site after cremating his father Paravasu blames Arvasu for the slaying and has him badly beaten up. When Nittilai hears of this, she comes to the rescue of Arvasu and finds that she is being hunted by her husband and her brother, who will kill her on sight for dishonoring the tribe's customs. Sutradhar (Raghuvir Yadav) arranges an act to entertain the Devas and chooses Arvasu an important role. During the act, under the influence of bhang, Arvasu goes berserk, destroying the havan and throwing the offerings to the starved locals. Nittilai, in an attempt to stop Arvasu, exposes herself and is killed by her husband; Parvasu admits failure, confessing his murder of his father and cremate's himself in the yajna's pyre. Finally appeased, Devraj Indra appears, and Arvasu is allowed a wish of his choice. Brahm Rakshas comes and begs him to set his soul free while Aravasu himself wants Nittilai back to live. Indra tells him that to bring back Nittilai he will have to turn the time back and to set the demon's soul free he will have to turn the time wheel forward. Aravasu, with teary eyes, asks Indra to set the Demon's soul free, which is followed by rain.

He composed it in 1724 in Leipzig for Epiphany and first performed it on 6 January 1724 as part of his first cantata cycle. Bach wrote the cantata to conclude his first Christmas season as Thomaskantor in Leipzig which had been celebrated with five cantatas, four of them new compositions, the Magnificat and a new Sanctus. The text by an anonymous author, who possibly supplied texts of two of the Christmas cantatas as well, combines the prescribed readings for the feast day, the prophecy from the Book of Isaiah and the gospel of Matthew about the Wise Men from the East. The librettist begins with a quotation from the prophecy, comments it by a stanza of the early anonymous Christmas carol \\"\\", says in a sequence of recitatives and arias that the prophecy was fulfilled in Bethlehem, concluding that the Christian should bring his heart as a gift. The cantata ends with a chorale, stanza 10 of Paul Gerhardt's hymn \\"\\". Bach festively scored the seven-movement cantata, for two vocal soloists (tenor and bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two recorders, two oboes da caccia, strings and basso continuo. All recitatives are secco, but the full orchestra plays for the opening chorus, the last aria and the closing chorale.  History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in 1724, in his first year as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, to conclude his first Christmas season on the Feast of Epiphany. For the celebrations on three days of Christmas, New Year's Day and the following Sunday, he had performed five cantatas, four of them new compositions, the Magnificat and a new Sanctus in D major: * : Sanctus in D major, BWV 238 : Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a  . The prescribed readings for the feast day were taken from the Book of Isaiah, the heathen will convert (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the Wise Men from the East bringing gifts of gold, myrrh and frankincense to the newborn Jesus (). The unknown poet of the cantata text may be the same as for BWV 40 and BWV 64 for the Second and Third Day of Christmas, a person \\"theologically competent and poetically skilfull (sic)\\", as the Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann writes. The librettist begins with the final verse of the epistle reading, Isaiah's prophecy \\"all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense\\". The poet juxtaposes the prediction by a chorale, stanza 4 of the old anonymous Christmas carol \\"\\" (\\"\\", \\"A babe is born in Bethlehem\\", 1543), which describes the arrival of the \\"\\" (Kings from Sheba), related to the epistle. The first recitative proclaims that the gospel is the fulfillment of the prophecy and concludes that it is the Christian's duty to bring his heart as a gift to Jesus. This idea is the theme of the following aria. The second recitative equals the gifts of the contemporary Christian to those of the kings: Faith to the gold, Prayer to the incense, and Patience to the myrrh. The last aria expresses that the devoted Christian offers his heart as a present. The cantata ends with a chorale. The text is not extant, but it is assumed to be stanza 10 of Paul Gerhardt's hymn \\"\\". Bach first performed the cantata for Epiphany on 6 January 1724. In his Christmas Oratorio of 1734, Bach dedicated Part VI, , to the topic and the occasion and first performed it on 6 January 1735.  Music  = Structure and scoring = Bach structured the cantata in seven movements. The opening chorus is followed by a chorale, then the two soloists sing a sequence of recitative and aria each, and work closes with a chorale. Bach scored the cantata for two vocal soloists (tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns (Co), two recorders (Fl), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. Bach employed a pair of horns before in his Christmas cantata , BWV 40, and later in his cantata for Christmas 1724, , and later in Part IV of his Christmas Oratorio. He wrote the title as \\"J. J. Festo Epiphan: Concerto. √† 2 Core du Chasse. 2 Hautb: da Caccia. / due Fiauti 2 Violini √® Viola con 4 Voci\\", which means: \\"Jesus help (Jesu Juva - a pre-fixed prayer to most of Bach's compositions). Feast of the Epiphany: concerto for 2 hunting horns. 2 oboes da caccia / two recorders 2 violins and viola with 4 voices.\\" The following table of movements gives the scoring according to the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book on all the Bach cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown. = Movements = Bach uses scoring and especially instrumentation to illustrate the contrast between poverty and abundance. While all recitatives are secco, and the strings are silent for the first aria which is supported only by the oboes da caccia in low register, a festive orchestra with three kinds of wind instruments and strings accompanies not only, as usual, the opening chorus and the closing chorale, but also the penultimate movement, a tenor aria expressing how the believer gives his heart as a present. Hofmann notes that Bach \\"combines high art with the folk style\\".  1  The opening chorus, \\"\\" (They will all come forth out of Sheba), depicts, that \\"\\" (all), not just the wise men, gather and move to adore. Horn signals call first and prevail throughout the movement. Canonical and imitative developments depict the growing of a crowd. The central section is an extended choral fugue, framed by two sections with the voices embedded in a repeat of the instrumental introduction. John Eliot Gardiner remarked in connection with his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage that the instrumentation resembles Near Eastern music, the recorders representing \\"the high pitches often associated with oriental music and the oboes da caccia (in tenor register) to evoke the shawm-like double-reed instruments (salamiya and zurna) of the Near East\\".  2  First print of \\" ‚Äì \\", published by in N√ºrnberg in 1553 The same idea is rendered in a stanza from the Christmas carol, \\"\\" (The kings came out of Sheba), telling of the (unknown number of) Kings from Sheba as mentioned by Isaiah. Its melody, in triple time, is set for four parts.  3  The first recitative, \\"\\" (What Isaiah prophesied there has happened in Bethlehem.), applies the situation to the individual Christian, who has nothing to offer as a gift but his heart, explained in an arioso ending. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes unexpected harmonies when the stable of Bethlehem is mentioned, as if to illustrate the \\"lowliness of that birthplace\\".  4  The first aria, \\"\\" (Gold from Ophir is too meager), is accompanied by the oboes da caccia, whose low register together with the bass voice conveys the humility expressed in the words. The instruments keep repeating the first motif, recalling the initial idea that gold is not good enough.  5  The tenor recitative, \\"\\" (Do not scorn, o You the light of my soul, my heart), begins with a plea, expressed in a line descending through a ninth. It ends on the notion \\"\\" (the abundance of the greatest wealth must some day be mine in Heaven).  6  To show the abundance, the dance-like aria, \\"\\" (Take me to Yourself as Your own), is accompanied by all the wind instruments, playing concertante and together. Instead of a conventional da capo aria, Bach creates a bar form by repeating the text of the second idea on new musical material. A long ritornello of 32 measures \\"contains an almost unprecedented variety of instrumental colouring\\", as Mincham writes.  7  The closing chorale, \\"\\" (Ah! now, then, my God, I fall confidently into Your hands.), is sung on the melody of \\"\\", which Bach used frequently later, as the base for his chorale cantata BWV 111 and movement 25 of his St Matthew Passion.

The Palatinate was invaded by an Imperial-Spanish army under Don Ambrosio Spinola, Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly and Don Gonzalo de C√≥rdoba. They defeated Protestant forces led by Frederick of the Palatinate, Baden-Durlach and Mansfeld. It ended with Frederick's exile, and the Palatinate divided between Spain and Maximilian of Bavaria. Background The Thirty Years War began in 1618 when the Protestant-dominated Bohemian Estates offered the Crown of Bohemia to Frederick of the Palatinate, rather than the conservative Catholic, Emperor Ferdinand II. Most of the Holy Roman Empire remained neutral, viewing it as an inheritance dispute, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. However, with neither Ferdinand or Frederick prepared to back down, Imperial forces invaded the Palatinate; removal of a hereditary prince changed the nature and extent of the war. Other Protestant powers became involved, among them James VI and I, king of England and Scotland, whose daughter Elizabeth was Frederick's wife. Protestant states within the Empire saw it as a threat, including external powers who held Imperial territories; Nassau-Dillenburg was a hereditary possession of the Dutch Prince of Orange, while Christian IV of Denmark was also Duke of Holstein. The war coincided with the end of the 1609 to 1621 Twelve Years' Truce between the Dutch Republic and Spain, and provided an opportunity for France, who faced a series of Spanish-backed Huguenot rebellions. The campaign Don Ambrosio Spinola, by Peter Paul Rubens Commanded by C√≥rdoba and Spinola, 25,000 men from the Army of Flanders left Brussels in August 1620, and entered the Lower Palatinate in early September. By 1 October, they had taken Kreuznach, Oppenheim, and Bacharach, and occupied the Bergstrasse district. Mainz fell to C√≥rdoba in August 1621, while Spinola besieged J√ºlich; it surrendered in February 1622, cutting the supply route between the Dutch Republic and the Upper Palatinate. In March, Tilly and the army of the Catholic League invaded from Bavaria; he was intercepted by Protestant forces under Baden-Durlach and Mansfeld, leading to the inconclusive Battle of Mingolsheim on 27 April. Mansfeld then moved onto Ladenburg, while Baden-Durlach pursued the Bavarians; unaware Tilly had linked up with C√≥rdoba, on 8 May, he was defeated at Wimpfen. Operations were then halted by disease.Antonio Fonseca, De epidemia febrili grassante in exercitu regis catholici in inferiori palatinatu, anno 1620 et 21 (Mechelen, Henry Jaye, 1623) ‚Äì an account of the epidemic that decimated Spanish forces in the Lower Palatinate, available on Google Books. By early November, Imperial- Spanish forces captured Heidelberg and Mannheim, the two leading cities in the Lower Palatinate. Frederick fled into exile in the United Provinces. The Spanish occupied the western part of the Palatinate, cementing their control of the strategic corridor known as the Spanish Road; Maximilian of Bavaria took the rest. The Protestant army in the Palatinate contained volunteers from many countries, including several English regiments, led by Sir Horace Vere. Concentrated at Frankenthal, they were left isolated by defeats elsewhere, and in March 1623, James instructed them to surrender, ending the campaign. Aftermath Count Tilly, the 'Monk in armour.' James' instructions to De Vere were based on the assumption he had agreed a deal with Philip IV to restore Frederick to his possessions, but this proved not to be the case. In February 1623, Ferdinand removed Frederick as one of the seven Imperial Prince-electors, his vote going to Maximilian of Bavaria. On 6 August, Tilly defeated a Protestant army under Christian of Brunswick in the Battle of Stadtlohn, and Frederick signed an armistice with Ferdinand, ending the \\"Palatine Phase\\" of the Thirty Years' War. Ferdinand declared Bohemia a hereditary Habsburg possession, confiscated land from the Protestant nobles who led the revolt, and embarked on a Catholic Counter-Reformation. This ensured the war would continue, and in 1624, England, France, the Dutch Republic, Sweden, Denmark-Norway, the Duchy of Savoy, the Republic of Venice, and Brandenburg created an anti-Habsburg alliance.

When he needs help the children repay his kindness by coming to his rescue. Author The German author lived in exile in Switzerland and wrote under a pseudonym to avoid political persecution. Background of the story Kl√§ber traveled to Yugoslavia in 1940, where he met Branko, Zora and her gang. The book is based on his experiences with these orphaned children in the Croatian city of Senj, where there is a castle called Nehaj Fortress. In real life as in the story, the first child Kl√§ber met in Senj was Branko, a boy who had recently been orphaned. Zora told Branko that the police were investigating him for stealing food. So Kl√§ber was introduced to Zora. He wanted to take Branko and Zora back to Switzerland with him, but his refugee status made that impossible. Instead he wrote the children's story, intending to make it a political tool to draw attention to marginalized people in Europe. Zora became the central figure because Kl√§ber was impressed with the way she organized the children into a gang and taught them solidarity. The boys accepted her as their leader. Title The German title Rote Zora ... refers to Zora's red hair. The Uskoken in the English title refers to the Uskoks, a band of pirates from 16th century Senj. Plot summary The book recounts the children's adventures as they live by the rules of their community and come into conflict with the city's residents. It begins by introducing some of the children. Branko's father is a traveling fiddler, so Branko used to live with his mother, who worked in a tobacco plant. But she has died, leaving Branko homeless. He finds a fish on the ground at the market, picks it up and is arrested for theft. Zora frees him through the window of the prison and takes him to the castle, which the gang has made their home. After passing a test of his courage, Branko is accepted into the gang of outlaws along with Nicola, Pavle and Duro. The city residents persecute the children, who play pranks on them in retaliation. In one episode, the gang steals a chicken from the old fisherman Gorian, who is honest, poor and works hard. Branko and Zora feel sorry for him and try to repay him with chickens stolen from the wealthy Karaman. Gorian catches them and insists that they return the stolen chickens. The children promise to help Gorian by working for him when he is short-handed. They help him in his conflicts with a large fishery. Reception The book was originally published by the Schweizer Sauerl√§nder-Verlag in Aarau. it is still published in German by the Patmos Verlagsgruppe and is in its 36th printing. It has been translated into 18 languages, the latest being Croatian http://knjiznice.nsk.hr/senj/svecana-promocija-romana-crvenokosa-zora-i- njezina-druzina-na-hrvatskom-jeziku/. The novel has been made into a filmhttp://rote-zora.universal-pictures.de//2766 and a television series. The television series was aired on television in Croatia, but only late at night to prevent children from seeing it, the reason being that then the communist authorities did not want attention to be drawn to its marginalized people. The book was adapted into a theater play by a Croatian actor/director Rene Medve≈°ek, and it premiered in Tre≈°nja theater in Zagreb in March 2017.https://www.scena.hr/kultura/premijera-zora-ridokosa/ See also *Die Rote Zora, a German militant feminist group active in West Germany from 1974‚Äì1995, who took their name from the story because the band was founded and led by a girl.

German rule in Russia 1941‚Äì1945: A Study of Occupation Policies, p. 65 (see note 1). Westview press. Soviet historian Lev Bezymenski claimed that names Panturkestan, Gro√üturkestan (\\"Greater Turkestan\\") and Mohammed-Reich (\\"Mohammedan Empire\\") were also considered for the territory. The proposal for a Reichskomissariat in this region was made by Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg; however, it was rejected by Adolf Hitler who told Rosenberg that Nazi plans ought to be restricted to Europe for the time being.Alexander Dallin. German rule in Russia, 1941-1945: a study of occupation policies. Westview Press, 1981. P. 53. Background Prior to the start of Operation Barbarossa, Rosenberg included the ethnically mainly Turkic and Muslim areas of the USSR in Central Asia in his plans for the future establishment of German supremacy in the remnants of the Soviet Union due to their historical antagonism to the extension of Russian control over the area, in spite of his doubts that German conquests would reach that far east.Berkhoff, Karel Cornelis (2004). Harvest of despair: life and death in Ukraine under Nazi rule, p. 47. Copyright by the President and Fellows of Harvard College. His original proposal entailed the creation of a string of \\"de-Russified\\" and German-friendly suzerainties ‚Äî likely to be someday linked to the Third Reich by either or both the planned Breitspurbahn three-meter rail gauge Nazi heavy rail network and the easternmost extensions of the Reichsautobahn divided highway system ‚Äî around the Russian \\"core area\\" of Muscovy, which was to be deprived of its access to the Baltic and Black Seas. These entities were Greater Finland, the Baltic region, White Ruthenia (Belarus), Greater Ukraine, Greater Caucasia, Turkestan, Idel-Ural, and Siberia, while a stretch of territory on the western frontier with Germany was to become either part of it or otherwise be under its direct control. This suggestion was rejected by Adolf Hitler due to not meeting his stated objective of acquiring sufficient Lebensraum in the east for Germany. On Hitler's orders, the proposal for a German civil administration in Central Asia was also shelved by Rosenberg at least for the immediate future, who was instead directed to focus his work on the European parts of the USSR for the time-being. Rosenberg received advisories on the Turkestan question from Uzbek emigrant Veli Kayyun Han, who from August 1942 headed the Berlin-based collaborating Turkestan National Committee under the auspices of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. Territorial extent Soviet Central Asia in 1922 Rosenberg's plan projected the inclusion of the five Central Asian Soviet Republics into the Reichskommissariat: Kazak SSR, Uzbek SSR, Turkmen SSR, Tajik SSR and Kyrgyz SSR.–ë–µ–∑—ã–º–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ê. –ê. –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–ª–∞–Ω ¬´–û—Å—Ç¬ª: –∑–∞–º—ã—Å–ª—ã, —Ü–µ–ª–∏, —Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å // –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. ‚Äì 1978. ‚Äì ‚Ññ 5. ‚Äì –°. 78 (in Russian) The population of these republics was not homogeneously of Turkic ethnicity (particularly Tajikistan which is in fact predominantly Iranian origin, and whose inhabitants speak the Persian language), but overall shared the Muslim religion, some of whose adherents‚Äîmost specifically in the Middle East‚Äîattracted a limited degree of respect from members of the Nazi Party's leadership personnel.

The eastern limit of the entire territory was never definitively settled during the Second World War. In the event that the Axis forces would have occupied the remainder of the unconquered Soviet Union, a delimitation of the region along the 70¬∞ east longitude line was proposed by the Empire of Japan in late 1941, which would have marked the western limit of its own holdings in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.Weinberg, Gerhard L (2005).

It is a part of Tbilisi Vano Sarajishvili State Conservatory. Establishment of IRCTP was announced during the First International Symposium of Traditional Polyphony in 2002, and it was logistically established by the order of the Rector of Tbilisi State Conservatory in February 2003. Its director is Rusudan Tsurtsumia. The head of its International Bureau is Joseph Jordania. Central activity of the Polyphonic Center is organizing biannual symposia, with subsequent publication of the presented papers, fostering dissemination of the knowledge on human musical cultures and establishing close professional contacts between ethnomusicologists interested in study of the phenomenon of traditional choral singing. History  Georgia has been known among ethnomusicologists as the country with extremely rich traditions of vocal polyphony since the 1920s. Study of vocal polyphony has been one of the central issues for Georgian ethnomusicology from the second half of the 19th century. In 1972 Union of Composers of Soviet Union organized the conference dedicated to traditional polyphony in Georgia (this was the very first conference in the world, fully dedicated to traditional polyphony). The ongoing series of biannual conferences dedicated to the problems of traditional polyphony, with the wide participation of the experts from Soviet Union, Europe and America, were organized in 1984, 1986 and 1988. The following conference (scheduled in 1990) was initially postponed and later canceled due to the political instability in post-soviet Georgia. The series of biannual conferences on traditional polyphony were revived in 1998 and 2000, leading to the organizing of the First International Symposium on Traditional Polyphony in 2002. The first symposium was preceded by proclamation of Georgian traditional polyphony among the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2001. Representative of UNESCO attended the symposium, providing support of UNESCO. The Polyphonic Centre has been supported during the recent years by the Presidents of Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze and Mikhail Saakashvili. For several years the Polyphonic Centre was also supported by the Japanese government. There has been a steady increase in interest towards the study of traditional polyphony (choral singing) during the recent years. In the 1970s there were two initial conferences organized on this subject, in the 1980s four conference, in the 1990s three conferences, and during the first decade of the 21st century nine conferences had been organized in several countries (apart from Georgia, in Taiwan in 2002, in Austria in 2005 and 2008, in Portugal in 2007). A centre for the study of European traditional polyphony was established at Vienna University in 2005, and the study group on multipart music of ICTM was established in 2009 and organized a conference in Sardinia, Italy in 2010. The earliest international organization to dedicate its activity entirely to study of traditional choral singing was Polifonies Vivante, organized in France during the 1991-1994 by Simha Arom. International symposia International symposia on the problems of traditional polyphony had been organized biannually from 2002. The last one was held on September 26 - October 1, 2016. All of them had been organized in late September - early October, at the Tbilisi State Conservatory. The geography of representation of scholars from different countries of the world had been steadily increasing. A group of international expert- ethnomusicologists, including Simha Arom from France, Dieter Christensen from the United States, Franz Fodermayr from Austria, Polo Vallejo from Spain, had been participating in virtually every symposia, together with ethnomusicologists from different countries (including experts from China, Japan, Australia, Canada, eastern and western Europe, Turkey, Egypt. The general program of the symposia is stable and contains twelve themes, covering wide range of research topics, including problems of vocal and instrumental polyphony, folk and church music, regional styles, elements of musical language, social and gender aspects, history, links with popular musical styles. Participating scholars are traditionally provided by the hosts with hotel accommodation, internal transport and food during the Symposium. In 2010 for the first time a special theme was added (vocal polyphony is Asia). 2012 symposium (September 24‚Äì29) had the special theme comparative research in traditional polyphony, 2014 Symposium main theme was Polyphony in Minority Music (September 22‚Äì26, 2014), and 2016 symposium was dedicated to the geographic dynamics of traditional polyphony (September 26 - October 1, 2016). Next symposium is planning to a later date: October 29 - November 3, 2018. Publications The most important publication of the IRCTP is the proceedings of the biannual symposia. They are usually prepared under the editorship of Rusudan Tsurtsumia and Joseph Jordania. All the papers of the previous symposia are freely available on the website of the IRCTP on both Georgian and English languages Papers presented at the Symposia Bulletins are another periodic publication of the IRCTP Bulletins of the Polyphonic Center Centre also published several collections of the articles, including Seventeen Arguments on Georgian Polyphony and numerous audio and video materials.

The first company was notorious for producing Familiada, the Polish adaptation of Family Feud. Initially, financial assistance was assured by an agreement with Capital Partners, but the company resigned from the project. From launch to June 30, 2009, its president was Ryszard Krajewski. The channel started broadcasting on October 2, 2006. Initially, the idea was to create a tabloid television channel. Among these contents were reports on showbiz stars and crime. Gradually, however, Superstacja started to add more political programming into its schedule. Notable political commentators during this time included Janina Paradowska, Eliza Michalik, Wojciech Mazowiecki and Waldemar Jan Dziak, later Piotr Gembarowski and Mariusz Max Kolonko. In May 2007, 50% of Superstacja's stocks were sold to Ster, linked to Heronim Ruta, a Cyfrowy Polsat shareholder e and close associate of Zygmunt Solorz-≈ªak.

Background Andrey Khrzhanovskij directed this film in a surrealistic, constrictivistic world, which resembles to the paintings by Giorgio de Chirico. Plot An employee, called Kozyavin, receives an assignment from his boss to find another employee called Sidorov. Without any questions, he soon left the office to search for Sidorov. Encountering traffic, he walked instead through sewer. He then arrived a wall, which was destroyed soon by a construction machine. There he met a builder and touched his shoulders. The builder turned to him and Kozyavin asked him, but he didn't hear anything he said close his ears. The builder took a little red flag from his suit and waved with it, until every builder stopped work, together with the machines. Kozyavin asked one more time, if he saw Sidorov. After a surprising action, he walked further to search for Sidorov. An active ramp in the building site, which worked intermittently up and down, didn't frighten up Kozyavin. Without taking any break, Kozyavin continued to walk. On a fair, he walked upon a pole. The children, who were amazed about his acrobatic skills, were questioned by Kozyavin. After no reaction by them, the employee Kozyavin pursued his way with an optimistic view to comply with the task. The second person Kozyavin met was a violinist, who played a composition. Kozyavin asked the violinist if he saw Sidorov. Without any response, Kozyavin nudged him and took his violin bow. Walking on surrealistic stairs, he opened the door to a commission building. Kozyavin sparked a light and went through paintings and antiques and finally saw two people, who looked like thieves. Kozyavin was oblivious that they were going to steal the items from this building. However, Kozyavin touched one of the man's shoulders and asked the same question as before. Surprised, they helped Kozyavin by giving directions to Sidorov. Early next day he pursued the same direction. He entered a pipeline on the ground, in which curves were unrealistically smoothed by Kozyavin himself. He jumped from the pipeline onto the ground and trod on a dry veld. Determined to meet with Sidorov, Kozyavin went throughout the veld, until he climbed up to a mountain. With a good view, he watched everything around him. Unfortunately he didn't find anyone and continued to move forward. He arrived at a desert and got a view of a giant skeleton of a prehistoric animal. Walking through its backbone like a stair, he saw an archaeologist, who was researching the skeleton, and asked him the common question. With no reply and no regret about the destroyed skeleton by the archaeologist, Kozyavin continued walking. A body of stagnant water didn't block him to accomplish the task the boss gave him, so Kozyavin swam, until he reached Antarctica. Kozyavin walked around the world, until he arrived his office after failing to accomplish his boss's instruction to find Sidorov. Kozyavin answered it with a shrug and went back to his room.

Von Tuhr was born in St Petersburg to a Russian family of German ethnicity on 14 February 1864. When he was still a child, they moved to Germany. He studied at the universities of Heidelberg, Leipzig and Strasbourg and was much influenced by Bernhard Windscheid and Ernst Bekker.Andreas B Schwarz, Andreas von Tuhr (1938, Z√ºrich, Polygraphischer Verlag) p 12. He gained his doctorate summa cum laude in 1885 at Heidelberg where his Der Nothstand im Civilrecht was published in 1888. In 1891 he was appointed as lecturer at the University of Basel, and was promoted to full professor in 1893. He married Johanna Rentzell in 1892. In 1898 he was appointed to a chair at the University of Strasbourg and later became the university rector. It was here that he wrote his seminal multi-volume work Der allgemeine Teil des deutschen b√ºrgerlichen Rechts (1910 to 1918). When Alsace- Lorraine came under French control at the end of 1918, he had to leave his post. After two years in Germany he returned to Switzerland, taking up a chair at the University of Z√ºrich.

It is endemic to the Bahamas. It is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN (CR). The taxon was originally classified as its own distinct species in 1890 by Joel Asaph Allen before it was lumped with the Cuban oriole (Icterus melanopsis), Hispaniolan oriole (Icterus dominicensis), and Puerto Rican oriole (Icterus portoricensis) into a single species by the ornithologist James Bond in his book \\"Birds of the West Indies\\". It wasn't until 2010 that all four birds were again elevated to full species status based on a combination of evidence from DNA, plumage and song.Chesser, R. T., R. C. Banks, F. K. Barker, C. Cicero, J. L. Dunn, A. W. Kratter, I. J. Lovette, P. C. Rasmussen, J. V. Remsen, Jr, J. D. Rising, D. F. Stotz, and K. Winker. 2010. Fifty-first supplement to the American Ornithologists‚Äô Union Check-list of North American Birds. Auk 127(3):726-744. Since it was not recognized as a distinct species for so long, the Bahama oriole's preferred non-breeding season habitat is unknown and current estimates of its exact numbers remain vague. Description The Bahama oriole is a black and yellow oriole that has small white markings on the wings and tail. It shows the most yellow out of all the Caribbean orioles. The adult male and females are mostly black with yellow underparts, ranging from the mid-breast to the vent, thighs, rump, and lower back. Jaramillo, A., P. Burke. 1999. New World Blackbirds Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press The greater coverts and primaries are thinly fringed with white. The wing linings are yellow and the outer tail feathers have small white tips. The bill and eyes are dark black, and the legs are blue-grey. Like most tropical oriole species, the females are similar or identical to the males in coloring.Hofmann, C., T. Cronin, K. Omland. 2008. Evolution of sexual dichromatism. 1. Convergent losses of elaborate female coloration in New World orioles (Icterus spp.). Auk, 125:778-789. The immature Bahama oriole is more of an olive-grey with the head a yellowish color. Habitat Historically, the Bahama oriole has been known to inhabit only two major islands in the Bahamas: Abaco and Andros. It became extirpated from Abaco in the 1990s, and today remains only on Andros.White, J. W. 1998. A birder‚Äôs guide to the Bahama Islands (including Turks and Caicos). American Birding Association, Inc., Colorado Springs, Colorado. The exact reasons for their extirpation from Abaco remain unknown. The oriole is now found on the three major islands of Andros: North Andros, Mangrove Cay, and South Andros. It is likely the oriole also occurs on some of the smaller cays, but current documentation is lacking. The species was recognized as critically endangered by Birdlife International in 2011http://www.birdlife.org/globally-threatened-bird-forums/wp- content/uploads/2011/02/Americas-2010-20112.xls with population estimates of 300 or fewer individuals remaining.Price, M.

Pg. 75 in the COS/AOU/SCO Meeting Abstracts However, this population estimate conducted by Price et al. (2011) was exclusive to populations in developed habitats near the coast; new findings suggest that the population size could be much larger than previously estimated now that researchers have documented extensive populations in the pine forest. [Stonko, D.C., L.E. Rolle, L.S. Smith, A.L. Scarselletta, J.L. Christhilf, M.G. Rowley, S.S. Yates, S. Cant-Woodside, L. Brace, S.B. Johnson, and K.E. Omland. 2018. New documentation of pine forest nesting by the Critically Endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi). Journal of Caribbean Ornithology 31:1‚Äì5.] The Bahama oriole's habitats during the breeding season include human residential areas, although there is recent evidence that they also use other habitats including pine and broadleaf coppice forest. Developed habitats are important for nesting since the species often uses introduced Coconut Palm (Cocos nucifera).Price, M. R., V. Robinette, and W. K. Hayes. 2010. Population status and breeding ecology of the Bahama Oriole (Icterus dominicensis northropi). Pg. 75 in the COS/AOU/SCO Meeting Abstracts Bahama Orioles were recently discovered nesting within the pine forest, building nests in understory palms Leucothrinax morrisii and native Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea.) More recently the Bahama oriole has been recorded nesting in many other tree species including other native palms (Sabal palmetto, Coccothrinax argentata) and bananas (Musa). Though the general habitats of the Bahama oriole during the breeding season are known, the preferred habitat of the oriole during the non-breeding season is still unknown, although birds can be encountered in all terrestrial habitat types. Conservation Status The future of the Bahama oriole remains tenuous. The shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis), a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species, has expanded its South American and West Indies range northward, and reached Andros in the mid-1990s.Baltz, M.

Hayes. 2010. Population status and breeding ecology of the Bahama Oriole (Icterus dominicensis northropi). Pg. 75 in the COS/AOU/SCO Meeting Abstracts Also, in developed areas orioles frequently nest in Coconut Palm (Cocos nucifera), which are dying off because of lethal yellowing disease brought in with introduced palms.Price, M. R., V. Robinette, and W. K. Hayes. 2010. Population status and breeding ecology of the Bahama Oriole (Icterus dominicensis northropi). Pg. 75 in the COS/AOU/SCO Meeting Abstracts As of 2017, lethal yellowing disease has not spread to Mangrove Cay or South Andros. The bigger threats, however, are continued habitat loss from human development, introduced predators (including cats, rats, dogs and hogs) and stochastic processes that, because of the oriole's small population size, increase the risk of extinction.

It was \\"surrendered and regranted\\" by the Clan Kavanagh in 1543. Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of U√≠ Cheinnsealaig and king of Leinster held the lands of the Barony of Ballyane in 1167. His clan of MacMurrough-Kavanagh began to regain some of their former territories in the 14th century, especially in the north of the county, principally under Art MacMurrough Kavanagh. He extended their territories and exercised control over County Wexford () and over County Carlow () which is located in the province of Leinster. In pre-Norman times Leinster was part of the Kingdom of U√≠ Cheinnsealaig, whose capital was at Ferns. Gaelic chiefs were actively encouraged to surrender their lands to the king, and then have them regranted (returned) as freeholds paying a chief rent under a royal charter if they swore loyalty to him. Those who surrendered were also expected to speak English, wear English-style dress, remain loyal to the Crown, pay a rent and follow English laws and customs, In return they would be protected from attack and could organise local courts and enter the Parliament of Ireland. Surrender and Regrant was led by King Henry VIII (ruled 1509-47) in a bid to extend and secure his control over the island of Ireland. This policy started in the years between(1534‚Äì39) and the subsequent creation of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1541-42. Henry's problem was that many of the Irish clans remained autonomous and outside the control of his administration in Dublin. During the Tudor conquest of Ireland (c.1540-1603), surrender and regrant was the legal mechanism by which Irish clans were to be converted from a power structure rooted in clan and kin loyalties, to a late-feudal system under the English legal system. The policy was an attempt to involve the clan chiefs within the English polity, and to guarantee their property under English common law, as distinct from the traditional Irish Brehon law system. Clan Chief Kavanagher of Ballyane surrendered Cahir Kavanagh made his submission in March 1538. He renounced the jurisdiction of the Pope, agreed to hold their lands from the king, and to abandon all claims to tribute or black rent from their neighbours of the Pale. In return for this he received a royal grant of his land and possessions, was created \\"Baron of Ballyane\\" and was promised a life peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.

This species is a part of a subgroup of orioles (Clade A) that includes the North American orchard oriole, Icterus spurius, and the hooded oriole, Icterus cucullatus. The Puerto Rican oriole was previously grouped with Cuban oriole (Icterus melanopsis), Hispaniolan oriole (Icterus dominicensis), and Bahama oriole (Icterus northropi) as a single species, (Icterus dominicensis). In 2010, all four species became recognized as full species by the American Ornithologists' Union.Chesser, R. T., R. C. Banks, F. K. Barker, C. Cicero, J. L. Dunn, A. W. Kratter, I. J. Lovette, P. C. Rasmussen, J. V. Remsen, Jr, J. D. Rising , D. F. Stotz, and K. Winker. 2010. Fifty-first supplement to the American Ornithologists‚Äô Union Check-list of North American Birds. Auk 127(3):726-744. Habitat The oriole is endemic to Puerto Rico. Its natural habitats are the tropical forests, mangrove forests, and plantations. The bird also shows a natural preference for nesting in palm trees.Jaramillo, A., P. Burke. 1999. New World Blackbirds. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Behavior After breeding, adult Puerto Rican orioles and their young will remain together in a family group. It primarily forages in dense vegetation looking for a wide range of foods that includes fruits, insects, lizards, and nuts and grains. Description Males and females are similar in size and color. Males weigh about 41.0 grams and females weigh about 36.6 g. The average wingspan of males and females is 96.9 and 92.1 mm, respectively.Garrido, O., J. Wiley, A. Kirkconnell. 2005. Genus Icterus in the West Indies. Ornitologia Neotropical, 16: 449-470. In 2008, Hofmann, Cronin, and Omland, conducted a study that showed there is little color difference in the feathers between the males and females of many tropical orioles, including the Puerto Rican oriole.Hofmann, C., T. Cronin, K. Omland. 2008. Evolution of sexual dichromatism. 1. convergent losses of elaborate female coloration in New World orioles (Icterus spp.).Auk, 125: 778-789. This means that males and females both have elaborate colors, in contrast many temperate-zoned birds have brightly colored males and dull colored females. Adults are black with yellow on their lower belly and shoulder. The closely related Hispaniolan oriole (Icterus dominicensis) and Bahama oriole (Icterus northropi) have more yellow on their bodies, but, the Cuban oriole (Icterus melanopsis) has more black. Juveniles are tawny colored with an olive tint to their rump. Puerto Rican orioles develop their bright colors as they age. The tawny color offers a selective advantage to the adolescents since by helping with camouflage in the dense forest. This is likely the ancestral state for the genus Icterus. Communication It is likely that both males and females of the Puerto Rican oriole sing. It is often assumed that only the males sing, since that is the case for many temperate-zone birds. However, in 2009, Price, Lanyon, and Omland conducted a study that shows that both males and females of many tropical orioles sing. It is likely that I. portoricensis behaves similarly.Price, J., S. Lanyon, K. Omland. 2009. Losses of female song with changes from tropical to temperate breeding in the New World blackbirds. Proceedings Royal Society of London, Biological Sciences, 276: 1971-1980. The song of the Puerto Rican oriole is composed of clicks or ‚Äúhigh pitched whistles‚Äù and has a frequency range between 3.6 and 5.3 kHz. The bird combines between 15 and 27 different notes to make up their song.Price, J., N. Friedman, K. Omland. 2007. Song and plumage evolution in the New World orioles (Icterus) show similar lability and convergence in patterns. Evolution, 61: 850-863 Reproduction Most members of this genus are thought to be monogamous, establishing lifelong bonds between males and females. The Puerto Rican oriole breeds primarily from February through July. It lays about three eggs per clutch. The eggs are white with a bluish hue with light lavender-gray-brown speckles and spots. The nests of most species in this clade have loosely hanging nests, often suspended under palms trees.

Background The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt was a Muslim dynasty in Egypt (1250‚Äì1517). The Mamluks constituted a class of military slaves of either Turkic or Circassian origin. After a coup in 1250 they began ruling in Egypt and they annexed Syria and Palestine to their realm. Initially the relations between Mamluk Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire in Turkey and Balkans were friendly. But during the last years of the 15th century, the competition to control south Turkey (√áukurova, Cilicia of the antiquity) deteriorated the relations. Furthermore, during Ottoman-Safavid (Persia) war the Dulkadirids, which was a Mamluk vassal, supported Safavids. After the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, Ottoman vizier (later grand vizier) Hadim Sinan Pasha retaliated by annexing Dulkadirid territory (most of South East Anatolia) after the Battle of Turnadag to the Ottoman realm in 1515. The war between the two great powers was inevitable. Ottoman Sultan Selim I (the inflexible, r.1512-1520) won two decisive battles Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 and Battle of Ridaniya in 1517. Conquest of Cairo After the battle of Ridaniya (23 January 1517) Selim encamped on the island of Vustaniye (or Burac) facing Cairo (at ), the capital. But he didn't enter Cairo. Because Tumanbay II the sultan of Mamluks as well as Kayƒ±tbay another leader of Mamluks had managed to escape and Selim decided to concentrate on arresting the leaders before entering Cairo. Thus he sent only a vanguard regiment to Cairo on 26 January. Although the regiment was able to enter the capital without much fighting, the same night Tumanbay also secretly came to the capital. With the help of Cairo citizens he raided the Ottoman forces in the capital and began controlling Cairo. After hearing the news of Tumanbay's presence in Cairo, Selim sent his Janissaries to the city. After several days' fighting the Ottoman forces entered the city on 3 February 1517. Selim entered the city and sent messages () to other rulers about the conquest of Cairo. Nevertheless, the leaders of Mamluks were still on the loose.Joseph von Hammer: Geschichte der osmanischen Dichtkunst Vol I (translation: Mehmet Ata) Milliyet yayƒ±nlarƒ±, pp 275‚Äì276.  Aftermath  Tumanbay escaped from Cairo and tried to organize a new army composed of Egyptians together with what was left out of the Mamluk army. His army was no match for the Ottoman army. But he was planning to raid Selim's camp on Vustatiye island. However Selim heard about his plan and sent a force on Tumanbay to forestall his plans. After some small scale clashes Tumanbay was arrested on 26 March 1517. Selim's initial decision was to send Mamluk notables to ƒ∞stanbul. But after a while, he changed his decision. Tumanbay and the other notable Mamluks were executed on 13 April 1517 by a former Mamluk commander who had switched sides.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt II, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991, p 250.

It is located on the island's west coast approximately 20 km north of Ternate. Jailolo is a small port that serves Halmahera's northwestern coastal villages. Before the arrival of Europeans it was the most important political power on Halmahera. It is thought that the sultanate had a measure of influence and autonomy as a combined Portuguese and Ternatean force overran in it 1551. It was then under the control of the Dutch and Ternateans for two centuries. The Sultanate was re-established in 1798, by the Sultan of Tidore who had expelled the Dutch from his island and proclaimed a noble from Makian as Sultan of Jailolo. The Dutch forced the aristocracy into exile in 1832. Baba Hassan attempted a revolt in 1876, but his rebellion was easily put down by steam-powered Dutch warships. In 1914, a revolt over taxation saw Jailoloans kill the colonial district officer, and there was a revolt on the island of Waigeo off western New Guinea. The sultan's palace was located on a flat-topped hill above the junction of the Sahu-Sidangoli road, however, all remnants have now disappeared. The local people are the Sahu. They perform traditional dances in August and September to celebrate the rice harvest. They recently converted to Christianity.

Life He was born in the city of Cork, the youngest of three sons. The family resided at Dungourney, in the county of Cork, for some years, where his father was vicar. After the death of his father it was decided that Charles should be educated for the medical profession. He was apprenticed to Dr. Gibbings, of Cork. Unfortunately, at the end of his apprenticeship, when he offered himself for examination at the College of Surgeons in Dublin; he first learned, that, as Dr. Gibbings had not been a licentiate of the college, his apprenticeship was not valid. He had to carry out a second apprenticeship of five years with a Surgeon Todd, who took care of him in Dublin, before he could sit his exams, which he passed.Emma Le Fanu, Life of the Reverend Charles Edward Herbert Orpen, Dublin, 1860 The Claremont Institution around 1820 During his work at the Workhouse of the House of Industry in Dublin in 1816, Orpen found at least twenty-one deaf children. He selected a deaf and dumb boy, Thomas Collins, aged 10, for intensive tuition at his own home. In the following year, Dr Orpen carried out a public demonstration at the Assembly Rooms in the Rotunda, Dublin. Collins' progress in written language, in calculation, and in articulate speech, after only a few months' instruction, was so satisfactory that the cause of the Deaf and Dumb was immediately taken up by the public. The National Institution for Education of the Deaf and Dumb Poor in Ireland was formed shortly afterwards. The committee of this institution rented two rooms at the Penitentiary, Smithfield, Dublin, for the purpose of educating and boarding a small number of young deaf boys. However, there was a problem finding qualified teachers to educate the boys, and Orpen and friends devoted a considerable amount of time to finding the correct teaching methods and supporting the teachers. Orpen was an advocate of the manual method of Charles-Michel de l'√âp√©e. In 1817, the committee rented a house paid for by the House of Industry in Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street), which provided enough space to teach 16 pupils.George Newenham Wright, An Historical Guide to the City of Dublin The news of Dr Orpen's initiative led to a demand from rich parents anxious for their deaf children to receive education. The Committee issued a public appeal for funds, and in 1819 purchased a large demesne called Claremont with a house near the village of Glasnevin, just outside Dublin. At this time also female pupils were first admitted. In 1818 Orpen was appointed a medical inspector, which entailed visiting the homes of thousands of poor people in Dublin during the fever years of 1818/1819. He was shocked at their living conditions and criticised the landlords for the unsanitary condition of their properties. He later wrote a pamphlet based on his experiences, An Address to the Public on the State of the Poor in Dublin, Especially Connected with the Prevention of Cholera. Orpen was familiar with the Irish language and, being of a religious temperament, supported the efforts of Irish Society for Promoting the Education of the Native Irish through the Medium of Their Own Language to spread the Scriptures in Irish throughout the country. He wrote some tracts for the society. In 1823 Dr. Orpen married Alicia Frances Coane (n√©e Sirr, daughter of Major Henry Charles Sirr).RIA, Dictionary of Irish Biography, 2009, p. 907 They had nine children.

He has received several Tinig Awards and the 1991 Tanglaw ng Lahi Award from Ateneo de Manila University. Biography Like many Filipino singers in the 1970s, Basil S. Valdez started on a solo career as a folk singer. In 1972, he joined the Circus Band and soon after it disbanded, he released his first solo album entitled Ngayon at Kailanman. While in the Circus Band, he met Ryan Cayabyab, who was then part of another band. When Valdez was preparing tracks for the album Ngayon at Kailanman, he asked Cayabyab to collaborate with and write a few songs for him, which the composer did. Cayabyab then became Valdez's musical director for 27 years. In the 1980s, Valdez re-invented himself as a singer of movie theme songs. Among the most memorable were \\"Paano Ba ang Mangarap\\", \\"Muling Buksan ang Puso\\" and \\"Paraisong Parisukat\\". Valdez had throat cancer which sidelined his singing career in 1990. However, he recovered and found himself as a \\"healer\\". Valdez then sought the guidance of his Jesuit friends. They explained to him that he has gift of healing.

Crane also played under the alias of \\"Billy Johnson.\\"\\"Efren's Arrival as Cesar Morales Causes Stir\\", BilliardsDigest.com, Billiards Digest.\\"AKA: Nicknames, Monikers & Also Known As\\", OnePocket.org, Onepocket.org A former World 8-Ball and 9-Ball champion, Crane was a dominant player in the 1980s. He was voted by his peers to have the best 9-ball break in history.\\"Wade Crane Killed in Car Crash\\", AzBilliards.com, AzBilliards He was no relation to Irving Crane, another great American pool player. Early Days Wade Arlyn Crane grew up in Robbinsville, a small town with a population of 700 located in the westernmost part of North Carolina in the Smokey Mountains. He was the youngest of four children. His father was killed in an automobile accident shortly after he was born, which necessitated him being raised by his grandmother. Coming from a modest background, he sought employment at the age of 12 and landed a job in a small five-table pool room named Cooper's. It was here where he initially developed his passion for playing pool. He did odd jobs, keeping the pool room clean, sweeping floors, and even had a shoe shine stand. The owner would direct the customers to play pool with young Wade if the pool room was empty. Crane was a self-taught pool player. He soon began to enjoy the competitive spirit. In high school, he was a fullback on the football team, the Robbinsville squad, and made it to the state playoffs two years straight. After high school, Crane decided to leave Robbinsville and live with his older brother in Chicago, where he got a job at Brach's Confections, a candy company. He worked there for three years, earning $150 a week, and initially had little interest in playing pool. Sometimes, though, his older brother, Bill, would call on Wade to meet him at the local pool hall on Cicero Avenue. Bill would make bad games and find himself overmatched. He would then call on his little brother, Wade, to bail him by having him play the same pool players that he lost to. Thereafter, Bill began to match up Wade with the local players. At this time, both Bill and Wade became active in Chicago's pool scene. Soon Wade was competing at Bensinger's pool room in Chicago against tough opponents in the area, like Mexican Johnny, John Abruzzo, and George Walker. In 1965, Crane was making more money playing pool than working at Brach's Confections, so he decided to leave the Windy City and move to Atlanta, Georgia. It was at this time that he assumed the alias of \\"Billy Johnson,\\" a moniker he would hang onto for 20 more years. He changed his name because he wanted to engage in money matches down South and feared some might recognize the name \\"Wade Crane\\" from his earlier days of gambling throughout that region. \\"While me and a friend were driving along the interstate to this pool room, we passed a Howard Johnson's,\\" said Crane. He decided to just add on \\"Johnson\\" to \\"Bill\\" and came up with the road name of \\"Billy Johnson.\\" It was a good name for him because he had been using his brother's fake ID to get into the Chicago taverns and pool rooms, so he was used to answering to \\"Bill.\\" In the early '70s, Crane returned to North Carolina and opened his own pool room in Asheville, which was an attraction for many of the top players in the country, i.e., Buddy Hall, Jim Rempe, Mike Sigel, and Allen Hopkins. Now the 25-year-old Crane was ranked second to Luther Lassiter, who was the 9-Ball Champion of the South.\\"Wimpy Tackles an Ex-Tiger\\", Sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault, Sportsillustrated.com The money matches began to dwindle, so he decided to move to Knoxville, Tennessee, for a change. It is here where he met his third wife, Linda, who was a waitress at a steak and seafood restaurant. They dated for 18 months before he proposed. After they were married, the couple moved back to Crane's hometown of Robbinsville, where he operated a small video arcade and quit playing pool. It was three and a half years before his wife saw him shoot a game of pool. In 1983, pool became attractive to Crane once more, due to the large money payouts in pocket billiard competitions. Crane returned to the pool scene, but this time, he would be shooting pool in a new environment, competing in short race-type matches on pristine equipment at tournament venues instead of gambling long ahead sets on inferior equipment in various pool rooms around the country.\\"The Practical Champion,\\" by Mike Panazzo, pages 48-50, Billiards Digest, October 1985\\"Wade Crane Player Profile\\", InternationalPoolTour.com, International Pool Tour Professional career At the height of Crane's game in June 1985, he scored a perfect Accu-Stats score in the finals against Buddy Hall at the Resorts International Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the Last Call for 9-Ball tournament, a feat that to this day has never been achieved by any other competitor in a pool tournament during a finals match.\\"Top Player Wade Crane Killed in Car Accident\\", Poolmag.com, Pool & Billiards Magazine During one match, he ran seven consecutive racks against Hall.

The First Philippine Imprints. Journal of History 8 (Sept. 1960). Biography =Early life= Tom√°s Pinpin was born in Barrio Mabatang, Abucay, Bataan, between 1580 and 1585. The exact dates of birth and death as well as his parentage are unknown because in 1646 Dutch looters raided his home town of Abucay and burned the parish records. However, his last name indicates that he must have had Chinese ancestors. He is thought to have first come into contact with the printing world around 1608 or 1609, learning from the work of other Christian Chinese printers such as Juan de Vera, Pedro de Vera, and Luis Beltran who had already printed several books for Spanish missionaries. Pinpin started working as an apprentice at the printing press in Abucay in 1609. The printing press was run by the Dominicans, and Father Blancas employed young Pinpin and taught him the printing techniques of the time. In just one year he had developed enough skills to be promoted to printing manager. =Work as a printer= In 1610 he printed the book \\"Arte y Reglas de la Lengua Tagala\\", by his mentor Father Francisco Blancas de San Jose, and in the same year his famous \\"Librong Pagaaralan nang manga Tagalog nang Uicang Castilla\\" was printed by his assistant, Diego Talaghay. The book contained 119 pages divided into five parts and was meant to help Filipinos learn the Spanish language. The prologue read: Although the Librong Pagaaralan was the first printed book written by a Filipino in the local Tagalog language, it was not the first one in history, as it had been preceded by Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espanola y Tagala, that had been printed in Tagalog, in both Latin script and the commonly used Baybayin script of the natives of the time, in the year 1593. Pila where the Franciscans put up the printing press that was supervised by Tomas Pinpin In 1612 Pinpin supervised the set up of a printing press owned by the Franciscans in Pila, Laguna, where he printed \\"Vocabulario de Lengua Tagala\\", by Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura, which was the first dictionary of a language of the Philippine islands ever printed. He is also known to have printed at Binondo, Manila, between 1623 and 1627, as the early printing press was being transported to several places to bring the art of printing. In 1637 he published and printed what is thought to be the first newspaper in the Philippines, the 14-page \\"Sucesos Felices\\", that reported mainly on Spanish military victories. It is estimated that all throughout his career, from 1609 to 1639, Tomas Pinpin printed at least fourteen different publications. =Late years= Based on the fact that a book printed in 1648 contained the sentence \\"Printed in the Office of Tomas Pin-pin\\", historians believe that later in life he must have opened a printing shop together with his son Simon, to whom he taught the art of printing, and whose name appears on several books from the Jesuit press. This is not the church where Tom√°s Pinpin set up the printing press owned by the Franciscan it was in old Pila church now a ruin in Tirado Victoria Laguna. =Death and afterward= There are no other records of Tom√°s Pinpin after 1648, so both the date of his death and the place are unaccounted for.

It provides one of two known approaches to solving the graph realization problem, i.e. it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite sequence of natural numbers to be the degree sequence of a simple graph. A sequence obeying these conditions is called \\"graphic\\". The theorem was published in 1960 by Paul Erd≈ës and Tibor Gallai, after whom it is named. Statement A sequence of non-negative integers d_1geqcdotsgeq d_n can be represented as the degree sequence of a finite simple graph on n vertices if and only if d_1+cdots+d_n is even and : sum^{k}_{i=1}d_ileq k(k-1)+ sum^n_{i=k+1} min (d_i,k) holds for every k in 1leq kleq n. Proofs It is not difficult to show that the conditions of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGallai theorem are necessary for a sequence of numbers to be graphic. The requirement that the sum of the degrees be even is the handshaking lemma, already used by Euler in his 1736 paper on the bridges of K√∂nigsberg. The inequality between the sum of the k largest degrees and the sum of the remaining degrees can be established by double counting: the left side gives the numbers of edge-vertex adjacencies among the k highest-degree vertices, each such adjacency must either be on an edge with one or two high- degree endpoints, the k(k-1) term on the right gives the maximum possible number of edge-vertex adjacencies in which both endpoints have high degree, and the remaining term on the right upper bounds the number of edges that have exactly one high degree endpoint. Thus, the more difficult part of the proof is to show that, for any sequence of numbers obeying these conditions, there exists a graph for which it is the degree sequence. The original proof of was long and involved. cites a shorter proof by Claude Berge, based on ideas of network flow. Choudum instead provides a proof by mathematical induction on the sum of the degrees: he lets t be the first index of a number in the sequence for which d_t > d_{t+1} (or the penultimate number if all are equal), uses a case analysis to show that the sequence formed by subtracting one from d_t and from the last number in the sequence (and removing the last number if this subtraction causes it to become zero) is again graphic, and forms a graph representing the original sequence by adding an edge between the two positions from which one was subtracted. consider a sequence of \\"subrealizations\\", graphs whose degrees are upper bounded by the given degree sequence. They show that, if G is a subrealization, and i is the smallest index of a vertex in G whose degree is not equal to di, then G may be modified in a way that produces another subrealization, increasing the degree of vertex i without changing the degrees of the earlier vertices in the sequence. Repeated steps of this kind must eventually reach a realization of the given sequence, proving the theorem. Relation to integer partitions describe close connections between the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGallai theorem and the theory of integer partitions. Let m=sum d_i; then the sorted integer sequences summing to m may be interpreted as the partitions of m. Under majorization of their prefix sums, the partitions form a lattice, in which the minimal change between an individual partition and another partition lower in the partition order is to subtract one from one of the numbers d_i and add it to a number d_{j} that is smaller by at least two (d_{j} could be zero). As Aigner and Triesch show, this operation preserves the property of being graphic, so to prove the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGallai theorem it suffices to characterize the graphic sequences that are maximal in this majorization order. They provide such a characterization, in terms of the Ferrers diagrams of the corresponding partitions, and show that it is equivalent to the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGallai theorem. Graphic sequences for other types of graphs Similar theorems describe the degree sequences of simple directed graphs, simple directed graphs with loops, and simple bipartite graphs . The first problem is characterized by the Fulkerson‚ÄìChen‚ÄìAnstee theorem. The latter two cases, which are equivalent, are characterized by the Gale‚ÄìRyser theorem. Stronger version proved that it suffices to consider the kth inequality such that 1 leq k < n with a_k > a_{k+1} and for k = n. restrict the set of inequalities for graphs in an opposite thrust. If an even-summed positive sequence d has no repeated entries other than the maximum and the minimum (and the length exceeds the largest entry), then it suffices to check only the lth inequality, where l = max{k mid d_k geq k}. Generalization A finite sequences of nonnegative integers (d_1,cdots,d_n) with d_1 geq cdots geq d_n is graphic if sum_{i=1}^{n}d_i is even and there exists a sequence (c_1,cdots,c_n) that is graphic and majorizes (d_1,cdots,d_n).

Life Haszpra was born on 15 March 1882 in Slovakian Nado≈°any / Hontn√°das (currently Hontiansk√© Trs≈•any) in county Levice - L√©va, Slovakia. The family was one of smiths and passed the craft from father to son. His father was Herman (Arm√≠n) Haszpra from Topoƒæƒçianky / Kistapolczany. His mother, Marie Birovsk√°, was born on 21 September 1845 in Trenƒç√≠n / Trencsen and died on 30 June 1930 in Budapest. When his family moved to Budapest just a few years after his birth, Haszpra had to attend Hungarian schools. He was trained as a caster and founder and worked first in Budapest, where his master craftsman took notice of his skills and assigned him to more complex works in founding and casting large bronze statues. After some time, he became a foreman and left with a group he was leading to Vienna, where they worked for the \\"Srpek a spol.\\" company, again on creating large bronze statues. The company eventually moved to Brandys nad Labem, a town in Bohemia in the vicinity of Prague, where a foundry was founded for casting the monument of Master Johannes Hus to be placed to Old Town's square in Prague. This foundry became later the foundation of the company Melichar a Umrath and today's Brand√Ωsk√© stroj√≠rny a sl√©v√°rny. Haszpra created additional artistic works and trained new casters. While there, he also married to R≈Ø≈æena Homolov√°. Just after the works were finished, Haspra traveled to Oslo, Norway with his wife and a one-year-old daughter. However, after just half a year, he had to return to Bohemia, due to the start of the First World War. Haszpra had to serve in the Austrian-Hungarian army. He was injured twice. After the war ended, Haszpra began working together with his associate Hibala in the foundry in Brandys nad Labem. Some years after, they separated, and Josef Haszpra joined the company Masek a spol. in Prague. In the critical times of the Great Depression, whose victim he also became, he took any job to feed his family. A lucky chance helped him, since at that time, the famous Croatian sculptor and architect Ivan Me≈°troviƒç came to Czechoslovakia to fetch him and take him to Yugoslavia for cooperation of creating bronze statues together. He went there twice and left a couple of artistic works. When the economic situation in Czechoslovakia partially calmed down, Haszpra opened a workshop, where he first worked alone. The beginnings were difficult. After a few years he started to break through and thus started an intensive cooperation on works of famous sculptors (Myslbek, ≈†tursa, ≈†aloun, Louda, Benda, Pokorn√Ω, Lidick√Ω, Kodet and many others). He was also accepting orders from Slovakia, from sculptors such as Gibala, Trizuliak, ≈†tefunka and others. Shortly before the Second World War he created a 4 meter tall statue of general Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Hitler's Germany, casting from non-iron metals was banned. It was difficult times for the whole Haszpra's family. After the war ended, Haszpra could have resumed work and in 1947 he got the order to found a statue of T. G. Masaryk in Brandys nad Labem. This statue was removed in 1956 by command of the local communist party.http://media.itok.cz/media/storage/tok09-10.pdf In the middle of the 1950s Haspra trained casters founders in the Bratislava Research Institute for Founding. In 1958 the ministry officials asked Haszpra to cast several pieces of art for the World Expo in Brussels. Statues of the sculptor Lauda, which he cast in bronze in an extremely short time and without proper equipment, met with a great success in Brussels. Josef Haszpra died on 21 November 1966 in Brandys nad Labem, where he was buried. He left behind him his wife and two children.

Since its inception, the ARRS has received more than 2 million calls from the population and organisations for a variety of emergency situations. One of the most important functions of the emergency call centre is guiding (by telephone) people who become lost in the forest. From 2004 to 2018, nearly 2,000 people were guided out of the forest.  Rescue operations  Members of the ARRS have considerable experience in rescue missions, including fire fighting, rescuing survivors after plane crashes, mitigation of large-scale chemical accidents and explosions of the blocks of flats. Since 1998, the SAR brigades of the ARRS have conducted almost 64,000 rescue operations; more than 8,000 people were rescued. In 2007, an Aviation Rescue Swimmer division was established in ARRS in order to help the injured on sea. Specialized training programmes for rescue swimmers are based on the best practices of American and Norwegian rescue services. The aviation rescue swimmers division of ARRS is the only such unit in the northwest of Russia.  Hazmat response  Members of the special defence section assess of the impact of chemical, biological and radioactive contamination, using measuring devices to control the level of hazardous materials in the environment. In addition, specialists in this section participate in rescue operations in chemical accidents. Since 2006, the ARRS has mitigated dangerous substances. Decontamination services were not provided in the Arkhangelsk region before the formation of the ARRS. From 2006, specialists of the ARRS mitigated adverse effects from 46 damaged methyl bromide cylinders, 1820 chlorine cylinders, 800 liquid chlorine containers, 29 ammonia cylinders, 7.5 tons compressed and ammonia gas from refrigeration equipment, 5 acetylene, 5 hydrogen cylinders, and 5 methane cylinder. ARRS is the only emergency organisation in the northwest of Russia certified for providing Hazmat activities concerning with leaks, emissions, and spills of chemicals. The rescuers of ARRS conduct Hazmat activities not only within the Arkhangelsk Oblast. In September 2011, they drove over 3,5000 km from Arkhangelsk to Nyagan (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug) in order to eliminate a storage of liquefied chlorine.  Canine brigade  At the end of September 2003, two German shepherd puppies were selected for training. In June 2005, the dogs were certified as ready to provide rescue missions by passing two tests: searching for survivors in an inhabited area and in the forest. The same year, they were awarded the bronze medal in the EMERCOM regional Russian competition for SAR canine brigades. In 2018, the five canine brigades of the ARRS were re-certified Class A at the certification competition.  Psychological assistance  Psychologists in the ARRS provide emergency psychological assistance to the population by telephone. If necessary, they join rescuers to provide psychological assistance to potential suicides and work with relatives of accident victims or people lost in the forest. The psychologists' conclusions concerning a person lost in the forest help rescuers decide on a search strategy.  Public-safety education Specialists in the ARRS have developed and implemented preventive lectures on safety for the student population of the Arkhangelsk region. Audiences vary, from children 5‚Äì6 years of age to students at higher-educational institutions. Based on these presentations, the ARRS has developed two additional education programmes: a ‚ÄúSafety School‚Äù focused on children with cognitive impairment, and ‚ÄúFive Steps of Safety‚Äù, adapted for older preschool children. At the 2008 and 2009 Moscow exhibitions \\"Fire Safety in the 21st Century\\", specialists in the ARRS were awarded certificates and gold medals.

The most intuitive applications are car-navigation systems: A user wants to drive from A to B using the quickest possible route. The metric optimized here is the travel time. Intersections are represented by vertices, the street sections connecting them by edges. The edge weights represent the time it takes to drive along this segment of the street. A path from A to B is a sequence of edges (streets); the shortest path is the one with the minimal sum of edge weights among all possible paths. The shortest path in a graph can be computed using Dijkstra's algorithm; but given that road networks consist of tens of millions of vertices, this is impractical. Contraction hierarchies is a speed- up method optimized to exploit properties of graphs representing road networks. The speed-up is achieved by creating shortcuts in a preprocessing phase which are then used during a shortest-path query to skip over \\"unimportant\\" vertices. This is based on the observation that road networks are highly hierarchical. Some intersections, for example highway junctions, are \\"more important\\" and higher up in the hierarchy than for example a junction leading into a dead end. Shortcuts can be used to save the precomputed distance between two important junctions such that the algorithm doesn't have to consider the full path between these junctions at query time. Contraction hierarchies do not know about which roads humans consider \\"important\\" (e.g. highways), but they are provided with the graph as input and are able to assign importance to vertices using heuristics. Contraction hierarchies are not only applied to speed-up algorithms in car-navigation systems but also in web-based route planners, traffic simulation, and logistics optimization. Implementations of the algorithm are publicly available as open source software.  Algorithm  The contraction hierarchies (CH) algorithm is a two-phase approach to the shortest path problem consisting of a preprocessing phase and a query phase. As road networks change rather infrequently, more time (seconds to hours) can be used to once precompute some calculations before queries are to be answered. Using this precomputed data many queries can be answered taking very little time (microseconds) each. CHs rely on shortcuts to achieve this speedup. A shortcut connects two vertices u and v not adjacent in the original graph. Its edge weight is the sum of the edge weights on the shortest u-v path. Consider two large cities connected by a highway. Between these two cities, there is a multitude of junctions leading to small villages and suburbs. Most drivers want to get from one city to the other ‚Äì maybe as part of a larger route ‚Äì and not take one of the exits on the way. In the graph representing this street layout each intersections is represented by a node and edges are created between each neighboring intersections. To calculate the distance between these two cities, the algorithm has to traverse all the edges along the way, adding up their length. Precomputing this distance once and storing it in an additional edge created between the two large cities will save calculations each time this highway has to be evaluated in a query. This additional edge is called a \\"shortcut\\" and has no counterpart in the real world. The contraction hierarchies algorithm has no knowledge about street types but is able to determine which shortcuts have to be created using the graph alone as input. alt= = Preprocessing phase = The CH algorithm relies on shortcuts created in the preprocessing phase to reduce the search space ‚Äì that is the number of vertices CH has to look at, at query time. To achieve this, iterative vertex contractions are performed. When contracting a vertex v it is temporarily removed from the graph G, and a shortcut is created between each pair {u, w} of neighboring vertices if the shortest path from u to w contains v. The process of determining if the shortest path between u and w contains v is called witness search. It can be performed for example by computing a path from u to w using a forward search using only not yet contracted nodes. alt=  Node order  The vertices of the input graph have to be contracted in a way which minimizes the number of edges added to the graph by contractions. As optimal node ordering is NP-complete, heuristics are used. Bottom-up and top-down heuristics exist. On one hand, the computationally cheaper bottom-up heuristics decide the order in which to contract the vertices in a greedy fashion; this means the order is not known in advance but rather the next node is selected for contraction after the previous contraction has been completed. Top-down heuristics on the other hand precompute the whole node ordering before the first node is contracted. This yields better results but needs more preprocessing time. In bottom-up heuristics, a combination of factors is used to select the next vertex for contraction. As the number of shortcuts is the primary factor which determines preprocessing and query runtime, we want to keep it as small as possible. The most important term by which to select the next node for contraction is therefore the net number of edges added when contracting a node x. This is defined as A(x)-{(u, x) : (u, x) in E} where A(x) is the number of shortcuts that would be created if x were to be contracted and {(u, x) : (u, x) in E} is the number of edges incident to x. Using this criteria alone a linear path would result in a linear hierarchy (many levels) and no created shortcuts. By considering the number of nearby vertices which are already contracted a uniform contraction and a flat hierarchy (less levels) is achieved. This can for example be done by maintaining a counter for each node which is incremented each time a neighboring vertex is contracted. Nodes with lower counters are then preferred to nodes width higher counters. Top-down heuristics on the other hand yield better results but need more preprocessing time. They classify vertices which are part of many shortest paths as more important than those which are only needed for a few shortest paths. This can be approximated using nested dissections. To compute a nested dissection, one recursively separates a graph into two parts; which are themselves then separated into two parts and so on. That is, find a subset of nodes S subseteq V which when removed from the graph G separate G into two disjunct pieces G_1, G_2 of approximately equal size such that S cup G_1 cup G_2 = G. Place all nodes v in S last in the node ordering and then recursively compute the nested dissection for G_1 and G_2. The intuition being, that all queries from one half of the graph to the other half of the graph need to pass through the small separator and therefore nodes in this separator are of high importance. Nested dissections can be efficiently calculated on road networks because of their small separators. = Query phase = In the query phase, a bidirectional search is performed starting from the starting node s and the target node t on the original graph augmented by the shortcuts created in the preprocessing phase. The most important vertex on the shortest path between s and t will be either s or t themselves or more important than both s and t. Therefore the vertex u minimizing mathrm{dist}(s, u) + mathrm{dist}(u, t) is on the shortest s-t path in the original graph and mathrm{dist}(s, u) + mathrm{dist}(u, t) = mathrm{dist}(s, t) holds. This, in combination with how shortcuts are created, means that both forward and backward search only need to relax edges leading to more important nodes (upwards) in the hierarchy which keeps the search space small. In all up-(down-up)-down paths, the inner (down-up) can be skipped, because a shortcut has been created in the preprocessing stage. alt=  Path retrieval  A CH query as described above yields the time or distance from s to t but not the actual path. To obtain the list of edges (streets) on the shortest path the shortcuts taken have to be unpacked. Each shortcut is the concatenation of two other edges of the original graph or further shortcuts. Storing the middle vertex of each shortcut during contraction enables linear-time recursive unpacking of the shortest route.  Customized contraction hierarchies  If the edge weights are changed more often than the network topology, CH can be extended to a three-phase approach by including a customization phase between the preprocessing and query phase. This can be used for example to switch between shortest distance and shortest time or include current traffic information as well as user preferences like avoiding certain types of roads (ferries, highways, ...). In the preprocessing phase, most of the runtime is spent on computing the order in which the nodes are contracted. This sequence of contraction operations in the preprocessing phase can be saved for when they are later needed in the customization phase. Each time the metric is customized, the contractions can then be efficiently applied in the stored order using the custom metric. Additionally, depending on the new edge weights it may be necessary to recompute some shortcuts. For this to work, the contraction order has to be computed using metric- independent nested dissections.  Extensions and applications  CHs as described above search for a shortest path from one starting node to one target node. This is called one-to-one shortest path and is used for example in car-navigation systems. Other applications include matching GPS traces to road segments and speeding up traffic simulators which have to consider the likely routes taken by all drivers in a network. In route prediction one tries to estimate where a vehicle is likely headed by calculating how well its current and past positions agree with a shortest path from its starting point to any possible target. This can be efficiently done using CHs. In one-to-many scenarios, a starting node sand a set of target nodes T are given and the distance mathrm{dist}(s, t) for all t in T has to be computed. The most prominent application for one-to-many queries are point-of-interest searches. Typical examples include finding the closest gas station, restaurant or post office using actual travel time instead of geographical distance as metric. In the many-to-many shortest path scenario, a set of starting nodes S and a set of target nodes T are given and the distance mathrm{dist}(s_i, t_i) for all (s_i, t_j) in S times T has to be computed. This is used for example in logistic applications. CHs can be extended to many-to-many queries in the following manner: First, perform a backward upward search from each t_j in T. For each vertex u scanned during this search, one stores mathrm{dist}(t_j, u) in a bucket beta (u). Then, one runs a forward upward search from each s_i in S, checking for each non-empty bucket, whether the route over the corresponding vertex improves any best distance. That is, if mathrm{dist}(s_i, u) + mathrm{dist}(u, t_j) < mathrm{dist}(s_i, t_j) for any (s_i, t_j) in S times T. Some applications even require one-to-all computations, i.e., finding the distances from a source vertex s to all other vertices in the graph. As Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm visits each edge exactly once and therefore runs in linear time it is theoretically optimal. Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm, however, is hard to parallelize and is not cache-optimal because of its bad locality. CHs can be used for a more cache-optimal implementation. For this, a forward upward search from s followed by a downward scan over alle nodes in the shortcut-enriched graph is performed. The later operation scans through memory in a linear fashion, as the nodes are processed in decreasing order of importance and can therefore be placed in memory accordingly. Note, that this is possible because the order in which the nodes are processed in the second phase is independent of the source node s. In production, car- navigation systems should be able to compute fastest travel routes using predicted traffic information and display alternative routes. Both can be done using CHs. The former is called routing with time-dependent networks where the travel time of a given edge is no longer constant but rather a function of the time of day when entering the edge. Alternative routes need to be smooth looking, significantly different from the shortest path but not significantly longer. CHs can be extended to optimize multiple metrics at the same time; this is called multi-criteria route planning. For example one could minimize both travel cost and time. Another example are electric vehicles for which the available battery charge constrains the valid routes as the battery may not run empty.

History Development of the estates started in the 17th century, when sawmills were established in the valley, and the first concepts of private ownership of forests were established. The first sawmill was Grunnfoss Sag, established by Peder Juel in 1655, and included the rights from Ulvilla to Skj√¶kerfossen. Peter Dreier received permission for the estates of Suul and Nybygget in 1683. Grunnfoss Sag was bought by Rasmus √Ögeson Hagen in 1686, and started collecting the farms in the area. The name V√¶rdalsgodset was taken into use for parts of the area in 1736. During the 1780s and 1790s, Johan Wideroe Tonning bought the farms Suul, Nybygget, Mals√•, Juldal and V√¶ren estates. In 1807, Christen J. M√ºller, the owner of Vinje Gods in Mosvik, bought Tonning's estates and the Hagen family's estates (known as Vukugodset). After the estate filed for bankruptcy in 1819 during bad market conditions for the lumber industry, it was sold to Hilmar Meincke, who started using Holmen as the head office. The estate was again to do Nicolai Jenssen in 1832, who in 1845 rebuilt Holmen. He also built the first steam saw in √òrmelen in 1872.The Verdal Landslide on 19 May 1893 made shipping from Verdal impossible, resulting in a new sawmill being built in Levanger, which opened in 1902. Verdal Municipality bought the estate in 1908, but after much local debate sold it again in 1912 to Hjalmar Wessel. A year later, Trones Bruk, a sawmill in Verdals√∏ra, was built. He also sold 75 workers' homes and 61 crofts, along with of forest. During the late 1920s, the company had economic problems, and by 1930 the company had used up its share capital. The insurance company and main creditor, Idun, took over the administration of the company, and the ownership from 1932.

The victims were newsagency proprietor Min Lin; his wife, Yun Lin; their sons, Henry and Terry; and Yun Lin's sister, Irene Lin. The family were bludgeoned to death. Min Lin's sister Kathy discovered the bodies. Jun \\"Brenda\\" Lin, 15, was the only member of the immediate family to survive the incident as she was on a school trip in New Caledonia with Cheltenham Girls High School at the time. On 5 May 2011, Lian Bin \\"Robert\\" Xie ‚Äì Kathy's husband ‚Äì was arrested and charged with the murders. After several misstarts and abandoned trials, the third trial ended in December 2015 with a hung jury. Xie was later granted bail. A retrial was held in 2016, with a jury finding Xie guilty of the murders by a majority verdict on 12 January 2017. A funeral was held for the family at Sydney Olympic Park, New South Wales on 8 August 2009.  Murders  In the early hours of 18 July 2009 in North Epping, New South Wales, newsagent proprietor Min Lin, age 45; his wife, Yun Lin, 43; their sons, Henry (12) and Terry (9); and Yun Lin's sister, Irene Lin, 39, were bludgeoned to death. Kathy Lin, sister of Min Lin, and her husband Lian Bin \\"Robert\\" Xie discovered the bodies when they went to the house at around 9:00 am to see why the newsagency run by the Lin family was not open. After arriving, entering via the unlocked front door, going upstairs and seeing the bloodied rooms and battered bodies, Kathy called 000 for an ambulance and struggled to explain what she had seen to the dispatcher. While waiting for the police, Xie left Kathy at the scene to pick up Min Lin's and Kathy Lin's parents, who lived in Merrylands. Police and paramedics quickly arrived at the scene, but the victims were clearly beyond help. Investigation Police investigators noted the blood spatter from floor to ceiling, and the faces of the victims were so disfigured that forensic analysis had to be used to identify them. There was no evidence of a break-in (suggesting the use of a key). Nothing had been ransacked or stolen. It was clear that the killer had known the layout of the house, the location of the circuit breaker, and that Brenda was not home, as it appeared that the attacker did not enter her room. Forensic analysts also determined that the killings had been started with a hammer-like object, alleged at trial to have been bought from a $2 store, and four of the five victims had signs of asphyxia. There were 24 bloody shoe prints that were also evident, determined to be around US-size 8.5 to 10.5, indicating a lone attacker. Brenda Lin, then 15, was the only member of the immediate family to survive. She was on a year-10 French school trip in New Caledonia with Cheltenham Girls High School at the time, and learnt of the murders via Facebook. After the murders, Xie and Kathy Lin became her legal guardians, and they resumed operation of the successful newsagent business. Brenda Lin later said that she had been sexually abused by Xie during this period. A month after the attack, Strike Force Norburn was set-up to coordinate the investigation. In May 2010 the NSW Crime Commission told Kathy Lin about the discovery of shoe prints that may match an ASICS sneaker. Subsequently, a 6-month-long covert police surveillance video showed Xie cutting up a size 9.5 ASICS sneakers box and flushing it down a toilet. It was also found that Xie cleaned up his garage on the morning of the murders. Forensic investigators searched his home and found a stain on the floor of the garage, which the Crown prosecutor alleged was blood. Later analysis of \\"stain 91\\" by Cybergenetics in Pittsburgh, USA revealed it to contain DNA from four of the five victims. Trials Just after 9:00 am on 5 May 2011, Xie (then 47) was arrested without incident at his home in North Epping, following an extensive investigation, and on 19 December 2012, he was committed for trial. Xie's trial had been scheduled to begin in September 2013. DNA tests on some evidence were in the process of being completed.Jamelle Wells (31 May 2013) Trial over Lin family murder could last 12 weeks ABC News, Retrieved 20 July 2013. Regarding motive, it was revealed that Xie had been an ENT doctor in China before migrating to Melbourne in 2006, and had made an unsuccessful attempt to open a restaurant in Melbourne before relocating to Sydney. He had felt slighted by his loss of status and face when compared to his successful in-laws. He was also attracted sexually to his niece, Brenda Lin. On 22 July 2013, The Supreme Court delayed the trial until 17 March 2014. This was agreed between the prosecution and the defence, although the newspaper reports were not able to comment on the reasons for the delay. On 20 May and 21 May 2014, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Min Lin's and Kathy Lin's father, Yang Fei Lin, described his horror at learning that the five family members were dead. The second trial for the murders began in August 2014, but was abandoned again shortly thereafter in September due to health issues of the trial judge. The third trial commenced in February 2015. Xie, who had been refused bail ahead of the trial, pleaded not guilty. Robert Xie's defence lawyers argued that the injuries inflicted upon the family members indicated that the murders were committed by more than one person. On 1 December 2015, after a 9-month trial and 11 days of deliberation, two separate notes from the jury of 12 indicated they were unable to reach a verdict. An agreement still could not be reached after a direction from presiding Justice Elizabeth Fullerton indicating that she would accept a majority verdict of 11 to 1. Fullerton formally discharged the jury on 1 December. The date for a retrial was initially undecided, but then confirmed for August 2016. Xie was granted bail on 8 December 2015. The final trial commenced in Sydney in June 2016. As in the previous trial, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, and Justice Fullerton advised a majority (11 to 1) verdict would be accepted by the court. On 12 January 2017, a jury found Xie guilty of five counts of murder. Xie was sentenced on 13 February 2017 to five consecutive life sentences in prison without the possibility of parole.

Charles hires two assistants: Francis, a young man whom he met in prison, and Francis' brother-in-law, Louis. Francis is a petty thief discontented with his working-class background, while Louis is a humble mechanic, almost completely honest to a fault. Charles orders Francis to go to the casino ahead of him, create a cover story as an affluent high-roller, and find a means to get access to the backstage, which will be crucial in the route to the elevator shaft that is the sole means to the basement vault in which the casino proceeds are kept. Francis does this by beginning a romance with dancer Brigitte. However, enjoying his affluent facade, he gets so caught up in the wooing of Brigitte he frequently ignores Charles' communications, which almost leads to the robbery being cancelled until Francis assures him he can stick to the intricate plan. Meanwhile, Louis tells Charles he will forego his share of the money, fearing that he will be seduced by the luxuries it can buy him and that it will lead to more illegal behavior. On the night of the robbery, Francis cavalierly breaks up with Brigitte, but watches her performance. After the show ends, he hides backstage, goes to the casino roof and lowers himself down first into the casino ventilation system, and ultimately the elevator shaft. He penetrates the counting room, subdues the head cashier and his assistants, then lets in Charles, who puts the money in a pair of bags. The two of them leave with a billion francs. Francis hides the money in a swimming pool locker room. The next day Charles unexpectedly sends Louis on a train out of town, and demands to meet with Francis immediately. He shows Francis the front page of the newspaper ‚Äì there is a photograph with Francis in it, taken the night before as he had been watching the stage show. Charles tells Francis he's too risky, and thus he will leave the resort quickly and send Francis his share later. He orders him to get the bags and return them to him in an outdoor swap near the pool. Francis retrieves the bags, but finds police are everywhere in the pool area, making it difficult to pass the money to Charles, who is waiting at a table. Francis then overhears the cashier telling detectives he remembers the look of the suitcases used to carry out the money. Desperate, Francis places the bags in the pool. One bag breaks open, and Francis and Charles look on helplessly as the money inside floats to the top of the pool.

The French-Italian production received significant backing from MGM, who released it in the United States and other territories. The main role of Charles was always intended for Jean Gabin, but the supporting role of Francis was initially planned for Jean-Louis Trintignant. Alain Delon heard about the project and lobbied Bar for the role, saying, \\"I want to make this film\\". Delon, gaining a reputation for films made in Italy with director Luchino Visconti, was eager to work in lighter projects with wider audience appeal, but the American producers of the film felt that Delon, unlike Gabin, was not well known outside France and Italy, and were opposed to his casting, saying, \\"If he wants to do the film, let him do it for free\\". Delon offered a compromise, taking the film's distribution rights in certain countries instead of a straight salary. Because this had never been done before in France, this was known as \\"Delon's method\\". The gamble paid off well, with Jean Gabin later claiming that Delon earned ten times more money than him as a result. However, in 1965, Delon claimed \\"no one else has tried it since and made money\\". Reception The Washington Post called the film \\"dazzling... one of the best of its kind in years.\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said it was one of the ten best films of the year. The Mystery Writers of America gave the film an \\"Edgar\\" as the Best Foreign Movie of the year. Soundtrack The instrumental jazz score was composed by Michel Magne. An arrangement of the main title theme was recorded by American musician Jimmy Smith, and released as a single on Verve Records, which was owned by MGM at the time; it peaked at 96 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and on the Hot R&B; Sides chart. Smith later released the album Any Number Can Win on Verve, which featured his recording of the movie theme with other covers and some original compositions. Alternate version A colorized version of the film was created in 1994, and aired on French television in 1996. This version ran 14 minutes shorter, with many scenes truncated but almost none completely removed. Only the black-and- white version received a U.S. DVD release, while most DVD releases in other countries have offered both the complete black-and-white version and the shorter colorized version.

Early life Proulx was born in Sainte-Ad√®le, Quebec. His mother, Monique, was a Formula Atlantic driver in the 1970s and was one of the first women to be sponsored by a cigarette company. She gave up racing to support the career of her son. Career St√©phane won the 1987 Canadian Formula Ford 2000 Championship driving a Reynard 87SF for the Spenard-David Racing School. In 9 races he won 6, took 3 pole positions and finished on the podium in every race. In 1989 he made the step up to Formula 3000, joining GA Motorsport bringing his Player's Ltd sponsorship with him. He drove a Lola T89/50 Cosworth DFV but had a difficult season adjusting to the power and to the new circuits. He finished 5th at Le Mans and finished the season 17th in the Championship with 2 points. In 1990 he stayed in Formula 3000 but switched to Pacific Racing. Pacific had lost their sponsorship from Philip Morris and so St√©phane's Player's Ltd funding was a welcome addition. Proulx was competitive but he failed to capitalise on it. A 12th at Donington was followed by accidents at Silverstone, Pau, Jerez, Monza and Enna-Pergusa. 10th at Hockenheim in a rare finish was followed by gearbox failure at Brands Hatch. After two more accidents at Birmingham and Le Mans, he finished 7th at Nogaro in the final round. In 1991 Proulx came back to Canada and drove a Swift tuned by Mauro Lanaro in the Canadian rounds of the IMSA Molson Formula Atlantic series, being declared the Canadian Formula Atlantic Champion, after a win in the last round at Vancouver. In 1992 he competed in five rounds of the French F3 Championship driving a Dallara F392 Alfa Romeo for Formula Project Racing. Later life On April 3, 1993, while participating in a Formula Atlantic race at Phoenix International Raceway, Proulx was hit on head by a wheel lost by another competitor. He sustained head injuries from which he never recovered. Proulx died of complications resulting from HIV-related illness on November 21, 1993, in Sainte-Ad√®le.

In algorithms, precomputation is the act of performing an initial computation before run time to generate a lookup table that can be used by an algorithm to avoid repeated computation each time it is executed. Precomputation is often used in algorithms that depend on the results of expensive computations that don't depend on the input of the algorithm. A trivial example of precomputation is the use of hardcoded mathematical constants, such as œÄ and e, rather than computing their approximations to the necessary precision at run time. In databases, the term materialization is used to refer to storing the results of a precomputation, such as in a materialized view.  Overview  Precomputing a set of intermediate results at the beginning of an algorithm's execution can often increase algorithmic efficiency substantially. This becomes advantageous when one or more inputs is constrained to a small enough range that the results can be stored in a reasonably sized block of memory. Because memory access is essentially constant in time complexity (except for caching delays), any algorithm with a component which has worse than constant efficiency over a small input range can be improved by precomputing values. In some cases efficient approximation algorithms can be obtained by computing a discrete subset of values and interpolating for intermediate input values, since interpolation is also a linear operation.  History  Before the advent of computers, printed lookup tables of values were used by people to speed up hand calculations of complex functions, such as in trigonometric tables, logarithm tables, and tables of statistical density functions School children are often taught to memorize \\"times tables\\" to avoid calculations of the most commonly used numbers (up to 9 x 9 or 12 x 12). Even as early as 493 A.D., Victorius of Aquitaine wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in Roman numerals) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were \\"a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144\\" Maher, David. W. J. and John F. Makowski. \\"Literary Evidence for Roman Arithmetic With Fractions\\", 'Classical Philology' (2001) Vol. 96 No. 4 (2001) pp. 376‚Äì399. (See page p. 383.)  Examples  Even modern computer implementations of digital trigonometric functions often use precomputed lookup tables to either provide coefficients for interpolation algorithms or to initialise successive approximation algorithms. Many attacks on cryptosystems involve precomputation. Examples of large-scale precomputation as part of modern efficient algorithms include: * Rainbow tables * Perfect hashes * The cube attack * Precalculated BSP trees for visibility calculations in 3D graphics * Radiosity precomputation for illumination in 3D graphics Compilers use precomputation extensively as a means of increasing the run-time speed of the resulting code: this precomputation can be regarded as in effect a form of partial evaluation of the program code itself. Examples of this sort of precomputation include dataflow analysis and strength reduction steps.

He died on July 28 2014, in Karachi, Pakistan. His work continues to influence subsequent practitioners of these genres across Pakistan .  Life  Sajjad was born in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, in 1936. Shahid sajjad was a self- taught sculptor who began his career in advertising in 1955 ; a path that led him to become art director at an advertising agency in Karachi . Shahid traveled through South-East Asia, the Middle East and Europe on a motorcycle between 1960 and 1963. His first one-man show was held at the Karachi Arts Council in 1964. During a trip to Paris, his encounter with a single wood carving by Gauguin at the Louvre convinced him that this was what he must do. His determination led to his journey to the Rangamati forest in 1965, where he prepared fallen trees for carving, learning the qualities of the wood through trial and error. Career He took on a lucrative position in an advertising agency until around his twenties, deciding to travel Asia by motorbike. His journey left him at the Louvre in Paris. There, Sajjad was inspired by a Tahitian wood carving crafted by French artist Paul Gauguin. In 1965, he returned to the South Asian subcontinent ‚Äî a remote village called Rangamati in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), located within the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Sajjad visited Japan just eight years later; there, he learned the lost-wax casting method from sculptor, Akio Kato. Shahid lived and worked in the tribal area of the Chittagong Hill Tracts now Bangladesh. On his return from the Chittagong hill Tracts, he worked as art director for an advertising agency in Karachi until 1971, following which he turned to designing sets for a National dance ensemble for nearly two years. During the same period, he visited China and Japan, studying Lost Wax Bronze casting technique under Japanese sculptor Akio Kato whom he acknowledges as his only master. Shahid held a solo exhibition of wood and bronze sculptures at the Karachi Arts Council in 1974 and won the first prize in sculpture at the National Exhibition in Islamabad in 1977. A year later, he exhibited his bronze work at Atelier BM, Karachi. Shahid was commissioned by the Pakistan Army to execute a mural in bronze, later titled 'Cavalry through the Ages' that he completed in 1981. He was awarded national prize for sculpture in 1982. In 1980 he was offered the President‚Äôs Pride of Performance Award which he politely refused. In 1987, Shahid showed his 'Deduction' prints at Chawkandi Art, Karachi. The following year, he was invited by Seoul Olympics Organizing Committee to participate in the Olympiad of Art. Shahid's sculpture 'Woman in Agony' remains on permanent display at the Seoul Olympic Sculpture Park, Seoul, South Korea. The sculptor also participated in the Indian Triennial in Dehli, India, in 1991 and SAARC Festival held in the capital city in 1992. From 1992 to 1994, Shahid worked in Mansehra in North west Frontier Province of Pakistan on a series of woodcarvings that were shown at an exhibition titled 'My Primitives' held at Chawkandi art in 1994 and subsequently at the National college of Arts, Laahore.

In 1931 she founded the first Popular University of Cartagena, along with her husband Antonio Oliver Belm√°s. She was also the first woman to become an academic numerary of the Real Academia Espa√±ola, where she delivered her induction speech in 1979.  Biography  At the age of 7 she moved with her family to Melilla, where she lived until 1920. The memoir from that period were collected in Empezando la vida. In 1923 she passed the competitive exam for Auxiliary at the Drafting Room of the Sociedad Espa√±ola de Construcci√≥n Naval, where she started to work. She began her contributions to local newspapers one year later. At the age of 19 she started her studies in Education at a teacher training college, the Escuela Normal de Maestras de Murcia. In 1927 she met the Spanish poet Antonio Oliver Belm√°s, formalizing their relationship. She wrote in Ley: (entregas de capricho) and also in Obra en marcha: diario po√©tico in 1928, both magazines published by Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez for a minority audience. In 1929 she wrote her fourth work, Brocal, and she finished her Education studies at the Escuela Normal de Albacete in 1930. On 5 December 1931 she married Antonio and they both founded the first Popular University of Cartagena. In 1933 they both created the magazine Presencia, a body at this institution. The University had an adults' library, children's library as well as educational cinema, and it organized events such as conference programs, art exhibitions, etc. It was supported by the Patronato de Misiones Pedag√≥gicas. Carmen also worked as a teacher in the Escuela Nacional de P√°rvulos at El Ret√©n. In 1934 Carmen Conde published J√∫bilos, prologued by Gabriela Mistral and illustrated by Norah Borges. She worked as Inspector-Monitor of Studies at El Pardo Orphanage, until she resigned in 1935. Over this year, the couple contributed to national newspapers like El Sol, as well as to other Spanish American serial publications. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, her husband joined the republican troops, leading the Popular Front Radio Station num. 2. Carmen followed him through several Andalusian cities, but she returned to Cartagena to look after her mother. The Civil War outbreak forced them in July 1936 to give up the invitation from Gabriela Mistral (by then Consul of Chile in Lisboa), before traveling to France and Belgium, to study folklore institutions in those countries, for which she had obtained a grant. Likewise, she attended courses at the Faculty of Letters in Valencia, passing the competitive exam for Librarian, although she never practiced. In 1937 Conde began an intimate relationship with Amanda Junquera Butler, whom she had met the previous year. Because of legal and social conditions at the time, neither publicly acknowledged their relationship, nor divorced. Marked by authorities as a threat because she was a pro-Republican intellectual, Conde fled at the end of the war to Madrid with Junquera and went into hiding. Her husband was exiled to live in isolation in Murcia, but Conde continued to live with Junquera and her husband, , in Madrid and San Lorenzo de El Escorial until 1945. She managed to communicate with her husband through Jos√© Ballester Nicol√°s, director of La Verdad (a regional newspaper in Murcia) and Correos employee. In 1945, Oliver was allowed to move to Madrid and Conde joined him in an apartment, though their relationship was in name only. Her husband Antonio Oliver died in 1968, and Conde moved to Junquero's home in Madrid permanently. Three years later, Carmen promoted the complete compilation of his works. On 28 January 1979 she was elected as numeric member of the Real Academia Espa√±ola, taking the \\"k\\" seat, and delivering her induction speech entitled \\"Poes√≠a ante el tiempo y la inmortalidad\\". Known primarily as a poet and inspiration to a younger generation of writers, she also published eight novels. She spent the last years of her life, between 1992 and 1996, living in an old people's residency in Majadahonda (Madrid). In 1992 she wrote her testament leaving the complete collection of literary works by her and her husband to the City Hall of Cartagena, her hometown. Conde acknowledged her relationship with Junquero in her autobiography and dedicated many works to her partner and muse during her lifetime. In 2007, Jos√© Luis Ferris published Carmen Conde: vida, pasi√≥n y verso de una escritora olvidada (Carmen Conde: Life, Passion and Verse of a Forgotten Writer), which publicly chronicled the relationship of Conde and Junquera.

It is named after ≈†alek Castle near the town of Velenje.Planina, France. 1963. Slovenija in njeni kraji. Ljubljana: Pre≈°ernova dru≈æba, p 159. The valley lies between the Kamnik‚ÄìSavinja Alps to the west, the Pohorje Mountain Range to the east, and the Sava Hills to the south. It has a northwest-southeast orientation and is approximately 8 km long and 2 km wide. It contains a number of rivers and lakes. The Paka River runs through Velenje, with a number of tributaries from the northwest: Trebu≈°nica Creek, Veri≈æelj Creek and Slatina Creek. The Paka itself eventually flows into the Savinja River. The valley is separated from the Upper Savinja Valley () and Lower Savinja Valley () by the Golte Plateau, the Skorno Hills (, peaks along the Paka including Mount Oljka, and the Ponikva Plateau (). Especially on the north, the valley is closed in by a chain of high mountains, from northeast to northwest: Paka Mount Kozjak with its peaks Basali≈°ƒçe (1272 m) and ≈†pik (1108 m), Smodivnik (923 m), Stropnica (880 m), Vodemlja (780 m), Ljubela (779 m), Mount Gra≈°ka (, 825 m), the Kri≈°tan Pasture () (654 m), Big Peak (), and Stakne Peak (, 1258 m). The highest peaks rise beyond these: Mount Saint Ursula (, 1699 m; also named Ple≈°ivec), and Smrekovec (1577 m). The northern border of the valley meets the Karavanke mountain range, and this northern area of the valley therefore has the fewest road connections. The southern part of the valley is less mountainous, and is surrounded by lower mountains and hills such as Wine Mountain () to the northeast. The southern edge along the Lo≈ænica Hills arose along the geologically important ≈†o≈°tanj Fault, allowing the valley road access towards the east. The town of Velenje is also located at the end of this eastern opening. Because of mining in the vicinity of Velenje, subsidence results in water flooding the resulting basins and creating lakes. The largest lake is Lake Velenje () and nearby Lake Dru≈æmirje () and Lake ≈†kale (), approaching the Paka to the south at the western end of the valley, where the town of ≈†o≈°tanj is located. The ≈†alek Valley formed in the late Cenozoic era, during the Pliocene epoch of the Neogene period. Faults started to appear at this time due to epeirogenic movement, vertically lifting and lowering the surface. Ridges formed and the ground sank, and lignite deposits started to form between the sand and loam.Geografski obzornik: ƒçasopis za ≈°olsko geografijo 42, p. 16 These brown coal deposits represent the great majority of the mineral wealth of this area.

Martin Schifino's English translation appeared in 2009 under Arcadia Books' imprint Euro Crime. Plot The unexpected death of a highly disciplined and successful army member of Camp San Marcial is officially explained as suicide. Major Olmedo had always followed the letter of the law and never questioned orders through the army hierarchy. He only broke the law in one respect and that was to carry an unauthorized pistol, since his name had appeared on a terrorist organization's hit-list. Major Olmedo had recently completed a report which was commissioned by the Ministry of Defence in Madrid. In it, he recommended the closure of Camp San Marcial as an efficiency measure. This highlighted the growing cleavage between his own generation and style of troop which were dedicated to peace-keeping and winning wars with technology; vis-a- vis the older, Francoists, who still believed in numbers and yearned for a reinstatement of the recently abolished compulsory military service. When he gets shot there is an internal inquiry which results in a verdict of suicide. Marina, the Major's daughter, is not satisfied with this outcome and hires a private detective, Ricardo Cupido. Cupido sets about investigating the \\"crime\\" scene with rigour and a professional manner. The scene itself simply is the pistol and a note in hurried handwriting saying two words, Forgive me scrawled on one of the Major's business cards. Cupido questions each of the suspects and mulls over this problem even where Marina gives up on learning the truth because of the strain it is putting on her and dismisses him. Cupido does get to the bottom of the mystery. Main characters Samuel is a young man who has come through a divorce and lives by himself. He has a corner-house with a suntrap balcony and many plants and flowers that he tends to as his main hobby. He also does some photography. His business is in paper collection and recycling which he developed from his father's business as rag-and-bone man. Samuel gets infatuated with a beautiful young woman, Marina, who has two children one of whom she drops off at the school bus-stop each morning outside Samuel's house. Samuel one morning sets up his digital camera to take a picture of the lady, and programmes it to take a snap every 60 seconds. He comes home after work to find rather more than just pictures of her. He seizes his opportunity to get to know her by observing a dropped gold bracelet and then the next day rushing out to go and return it to her. He reaches her as she is getting to the steps to her own apartment and is surprised to learn she only lived nearby all along. Samuel and Marina get chatting and she is equally surprised to learn the plants she had been admiring belonged to his house because she is also a keen gardener. They become an item. Marina Olmedo is the daughter of the dead soldier. She has two children but has divorced from their father, Jaime. Jaime kept the business whilst she kept the house. Marina is beautiful and sensuous and after seven months is ready to move in with Samuel. Major Camilo Olmedo is a long-serving soldier with an impeccable record and fully disciplined and respectful of the military hierarchy. However very few of his colleagues actually like him, because he recognizes that times have changed and that modern armies are fighting the terrorist within rather than the enemy nation without. Major Olmedo's one misdemeanour is to always carry the type of pistol for which he has not been authorized, and he does so because he trusts no-one. He will sit with his back to a wall in any public place and is always on the lookout; this is why it was necessary for the army to reach a verdict of suicide where they investigated because it was so unexpected that he should be murdered. Olmedo's wife, Marina's mother, had died under anaesthetic when she had been in for cosmetic surgery. Captain Bramante is one of the Camp Marcial colleagues who was upset at Olmedo's report. Both he and Captain Ucha were absent from an informal meeting scheduled right after Olmedo delivered his damning report, to determine what their stance should be. Bramante falsely claimed to have been at the gym working out. His marriage is actually in danger and this lie ended up proving a red-herring because really he has been trying to hide things from a wife who is no longer proud of him, and he would love to go to Afghanistan and die what he considers a hero's death. Captain Ucha is the other Camp Marcial colleague who was under suspicion as a potential enemy of the Major's but without an immediate alibi. He is elderly and that three grown up daughters. He claimed to have been driving around at the time the death must have taken place. Ricardo Cupido: the private detective who does not give up on the case. He has an uncertain past but what is certain is that he has plenty of sympathy for thosefor whom out of grief badly require his services. He is persistent in retrieving the information he wants and often catches suspects out by thinking ahead of them. He discovers who committed the crime but feels oddly let down at the end because it is not a happy ending for all. Alkalino is Cupido's side-kick. He is described as not being particularly well turned-out and who has excessive amounts of facial hair. His main contribution is to hunt out a sixteen-year-old girl named Violeta who may have some useful information. Gabriela is a major suspect and at the centre of the main relationships. She is the mother of a 15-year-old boy who is savagely killed by a pit-bull terrier. She is single and the boy Manuel is all she had. She starts a relationship with Major Olmedo after her son was attacked and she becomes somewhat close to Marina. She has pictures of Manuel all over her apartment. Jaime is the former husband of Marina's and he is very good-looking and plays a lot with different women. He owns a business where he is hired to do jobs involving high-rise buildings. He did not get along with Olmedo and so was also a suspect not least because he was trying to claim some assets which were not in his name and he had not been keeping up with his alimony. Doctor Lesmes Beltr√°n is the anaesthetist who had given too much drugs to Olmedo's wife that killed her. He had been suspended from practice for four years and yet when he came back he continued to be highly successful. He was not disappointed to learn that Major Olmedo had been killed, only anxious that he did not want his career to be further jeopardized with suspicion and allegations. Reviews According to blogger Maxine Clarke, the book is excellent in its characterization, which gets easily into the minds and feelings of any kind of character and makes each person as readily accessible as the protagonist.Clarke, M.

Career Lewis was brought up in the same Canvey Island street as Lee Brilleaux who taught Lewis to play harmonica. Lewis' first performances were as a member of the Southside Jug Band on Canvey Island, which included future Dr Feelgood members Brilleaux and John B Sparks, together with Chris White. Guitarist Dave Higgs joined and they renamed themselves the Fix. Higgs later invited Lewis to become a member of Eddie & the Hot Rods, where Lewis performed on their first two singles \\"Writing on the Wall\\" and \\"Wooly Bully\\" he was known as a wild frontman, but left \\"after falling out with the management\\". He then released a solo single for Stiff Records, their fifth single \\"Boogie on the Street\\" / \\"Caravan Man\\", backed by a thinly disguised Dr Feelgood; the B side of the single later appearing on Hits Greatest Stiffs. Briefly moving to United Artists Records he released \\"Out for a Lark\\" / \\"Watch Yourself\\", which could credit Brilleaux and Sparks, as they were on UA. He returned to Stiff for his next single \\"Lucky Seven\\" / \\"Night Talk\\" (1978) his most successful single, which led to his appearing on Top of the Pops and which was covered by Dr Feelgood on their album Sneakin' Suspicion and also appears in the film Oil City Confidential. His album Save the Wail (1979) produced by Paul Riley, featured Buzz Barwell (ex Dr. Feelgood) and Bob Clouter (Ex Mickey Jupp's The Orioles) on drums, Rick Taylor and Pete Zear on guitars and Johnny Squirrel on bass, collectively known as Lew Lewis Reformer, they were, stylistically, \\"between pub rock and blues- rock\\". They toured Europe, being particularly popular in France and appeared on Musikladen in 1979. Also in 1979 Lewis, Dr Feelgood and Jools Holland performing as \\"The Oil City Sheiks\\" issued a single \\"Don't Take but a Few Minutes\\" / \\"Blues Jam\\" Lewis was also a guest on several albums, including The Stranglers' Black and White (1978), Jean-Jacques Burnel's Euroman Cometh (1979), The Clash's Sandinista! (1980), Kirsty MacColl‚Äôs Desperate Character (1981), Sniff 'n' the Tears Ride Blue Divide (1982) and Wilko Johnson's Bottle Up and Go! (1983). In 1987 Lewis was given a seven-year jail sentence for armed robbery, after holding up a post office with a fake pistol, stealing ¬£5,000 and trying to escape on a shopping bike. On his release, he issued a single \\"Shame, Shame, Shame\\" whilst Boogie on the Street Again!, a live album recorded in June 1977 and July 1979, was released in Japan in 1999. The 2002 CD reissue of Save the Wail also includes the Stiff singles \\"Boogie on the Street\\" and \\"1‚Äì30, 2‚Äì30, 3‚Äì35\\" as well as live recordings from 1977 and 1979. Despite his prison sentence, Lewis had undiagnosed \\"bipolar and psychotic episodes\\", and a drug addiction. In November 2009 he announced that having had \\"mental health issues\\" and \\"a breakdown\\", and been in and out of hospital \\"for the past eight years\\", he was finally drug-free, and only taking prescribed medication. Lewis performed with a new band Spooky Blues, but as of December 2010 he was performing as the Lew Lewis band, with Dave Deville (guitar and backing vocals) and Emma May (bass and backing vocals), but was looking for a new drummer to perform on their forthcoming European tours and a Japanese tour in March 2011.

A descendant of the progenitor of the Tudor dynasty, Ednyfed Fychan (d. 1246), he attained several positions in the administration of north Wales, including co-Constable of Flint Castle in north Wales by 1349, escheator of Caernarfonshire from 1347 to 1350, and rhaglaw (bailiff) of the commote of Dinmael in 1360-61. Rhys' career was not without controversy. In 1354 he was fined for taking bribes, and in 1358 the men of Englefield in north-east Wales complained to the Black Prince about Rhys' oppressive measures. He lived at Kinmel near Abergele, and was a patron of the poet Iolo Goch. Rhys' most important role in Welsh society was as a supporter of Owain Lawgoch, a mercenary in French pay and a claimant to the title of Prince of Wales, who attempted to invade Wales with French support in 1369 and again in 1372. During the latter year, Rhys' son Ieuan Wyn - who also served as a mercenary in France - was identified along with Owain as having received over 500 marks from Rhys to aid their fight against the English there. The allegations seem not to have harmed Rhys' career, as he was appointed chief serjeant of the lordship of Denbigh in 1374. He died in 1377. References * A. D.

He holds a number of aviation world records and was the founder of Dick Smith Electronics, Australian Geographic and Dick Smith Foods. He was selected as the 1986 Australian of the Year. In 2010, he founded the media production company Smith&Nasht; with the intention of producing films about global issues. In 2015, he was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia, and is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Early life Smith's father was a salesman and sometime manager at Angus & Robertson's bookstore who started a business that failed when Smith was 17, and his mother a housewife. His maternal grandfather was pictorialist photographer Harold Cazneaux. As a child, Smith was considered academically hopeless and, having a speech defect, called himself 'Dick Miff'. From his home in East Roseville, Smith attended Primary School at Roseville Public School at which, for the Fifth Grade, he ranked academically 45th in a class of 47. He attended North Sydney Technical High School. After three years of French he managed only 7% in the Intermediate Certificate examination. He went on to complete his Leaving Certificate in 1961. He joined the 1st East Roseville Scout Group as a Wolf Cub in 1952, aged 8 and later as a Boy Scout and Rover until 1967, earning the Baden-Powell Award in 1966. Smith gained his amateur radio licence at the age of 17 and holds call sign VK2DIK. In his early 20s, Smith worked as a taxi radio repair technician for several years. Aviation and adventures Dick Smith's Adventuring Around the World Map 1964‚Äì2013 (Will Pringle) Smith holds many world aviation records, made in rotary and fixed-wing aircraft and beneath balloons: * First solo trans-Atlantic flight by helicopter (1982) * First solo circumnavigation by helicopter (1983) * First helicopter to the North Pole (1987) * First circumnavigation landing at both poles (1989) * First non-stop balloon crossing of the Australian continent (1993) * First east-west circumnavigation by helicopter (1995) * First Trans-Tasman balloon flight (2000) Smith's first significant adventure was in 1964 when he sailed with a group of Rover Scouts to Balls Pyramid in the Pacific Ocean ‚Äì the highest sea spire in the world. Failing to top it on this occasion, Smith returned in 1980, completed an ascent and, together with Hugh Ward and John Worrall, formally claimed the land for Australia by unfurling the New South Wales state flag. He went on, in 1988, to sue the state government over its ban on recreational climbing of the spire because the \\"restrictions really attack people's right to have an adventure\\". His action was taken when the government refused an application by Greg Mortimer, the first Australian to climb Mt Everest, to make the climb. Smith learned to fly in 1972, graduating to a twin engine Beech Baron. In 1976, he competed in the Perth to Sydney air race. Smith conceived and initiated airline flights over Antarctica. His first flight was made by a chartered QANTAS aircraft on 13 February 1977. In August the same year, Smith chartered another jumbo, this time to take paying passengers on a 10-hour, 5,000 km flight over the Red Centre of the Outback in search of Lasseter's fabled but lost reef of gold. The search, attended by Lasseter's son Bob and Aboriginal tracker and artist Nosepeg Tjunkata Tjupurrula, found nothing. In 1978, he found the wreck of the Kookaburra aircraft, lost since an engine-failure forced pilot Keith Anderson to land in the Central Australian Desert in 1929.Smith, Dick. The Earth Beneath Me, Angus & Robertson Publishers (1983). , pp.1‚Äì3 At the age of 34, he purchased his first helicopter, a Bell Jetranger II, and, on 23 February 1979, obtained his licence to fly it. In January 1980, with Rick Howell co-piloting the Jetranger, he made a record-setting flight from Sydney to Lord Howe Island and return, 1,185 km. The helicopter opened new opportunities for exploring places otherwise inaccessible. In May 1981, Smith rediscovered the site where, in 1929, Charles Kingsford Smith emergency landed his Southern Cross on the banks of a tributary to the Glenelg River in a remote area of northwestern Australia, in what was to become known as the \\"Coffee Royal\\" affair. He and his family left a plaque on a small memorial they erected in the area where they found shell casings and other evidence of the landing. In 1982‚Äì83, Smith successfully completed the first solo helicopter flight around the world. His flight began in Fort Worth, Texas, on 5 August 1982, in a newly purchased Bell Jetranger 206B. Forced down north of Hudson Strait (1982) On 19 August, the 50th anniversary of James Mollison's solo crossing of the Atlantic, Smith completed the first solo Atlantic crossing in a helicopter when he arrived at Balmoral Castle, United Kingdom to be greeted by a waiting Prince Charles. From there he flew to London, where, later that day, the first stage of his flight ended, after 11,752 km. The second stage of his flight started in London on 13 September, and finished in Sydney, Australia, 3 October 1982, 23,092 km later.Smith, Dick. The Earth Beneath Me, Angus & Robertson Publishers (1983). On 25 May 1983 the final stage of the flight started. Not being granted permission to land in USSR, he arranged to land on a ship to refuel. His journey ended on 22 July 1983, the 50th anniversary of Wiley Post's solo aeroplane flight around the world on 22 July 1933. Smith made the first helicopter flight to the North Pole, upon his third attempt in his Jetranger helicopter. In 1986, he had to give up just 670 kilometres short of his destination because his navigation equipment was beginning to fail and visibility had dropped to almost zero. He failed once more, before his successful flight on 28 April 1987. The flight was made possible by having fuel delivered in a DHC-6 Twin Otter for refuelling in parts of the Arctic Circle.Robert Gott. Makers & Shakers, Heinemann Library, 1998. p. 38 In 1988/89, Smith flew a Twin Otter aircraft VH-SHW (registered after his hero, polar explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins) following meridians of longitude around the world, landing at both the North and South Poles, making him the first person to complete such a circumnavigation. The flight followed the \\"vertical\\" South- North-South track, (keeping broadly between 80 and 150 degrees E, heading south, and 60 and 100 degrees W, heading north) departing Sydney, Australia, on 1 November 1988, and returning on 28 May 1989. The journey included the first flight made from Australia to the Australian Antarctic Territory. In August and again in October 1989, Smith, piloting his own helicopter, initiated and conducted searches in remote tracts of the Simpson Desert for the first stage of the Redstone Sparta rocket which had carried Australia's first satellite into orbit, making the nation only the fourth to succeed in doing so, on 29 November 1967. His search was ultimately successful, the relic recovered in an elaborate 22-person overland expedition the following year and placed on display in Woomera. In October 1991, Smith was the second person to fly over Mount Everest. Dick and Pip Smith circled the summit in his Cessna Citation, taking photographs. In Australian Geographic (January‚ÄìMarch 1993) Dick wrote: 'The experience was unbelievable and I felt privileged to be one of the very few people to obtain permission from the Nepalese government to fly over the summit.\\"Robert Gott. Makers & Shakers, Heinemann Library, 1998. p. 46 Smith and his co-pilot John Wallington made the first balloon trip across Australia, in a Cameron-R77 Rozi√®re balloon, Australian Geographic Flyer, on 18 June 1993, for which he received the Commission International d'Aerostation (FAI Ballooning Commission)'s 1995 Montgolfier Diploma. In 1994, Smith accompanied Director-General Peter K N Lok of the Civil Aviation Department on the inaugural helicopter flight onto the helipad atop the Peninsula Hotel, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. In November of the same year, Smith broke the record for a purely solar-powered vehicular crossing of the Australian continent. Driving the Aurora Q1 for eight-and-a-half days, he completed the journey from Perth to Sydney at an average speed of . The vehicle was equipped with 1,943 solar cells epoxied to its fibreglass shell, with lead-acid and lithium-thionol batteries for storage, producing a maximum of 1.4 kW. He achieved a 20-day reduction in the record previously set by Hans Tholstrup and Larry Perkins 12 years earlier in The Quiet Achiever. It is notable that all of Smith's exploits involving navigation up to this point were accomplished without the aid of satellite navigation systems such as GPS. Often inaccurate and unreliable Very Low Frequency systems and systems using radio direction finding principles had to be supplemented by dead reckoning for determination of position. In June 1995, Smith completed another helicopter flight around the world, this time with his wife Pip. He bought a twin-engine Sikorsky S-76 helicopter. At their journey's end, Dick and Pip had completed the first east to west (i.e. against prevailing winds) helicopter flight around the globe, flown more than 39,607 nautical miles (73,352 kilometres) in the process and taken more than 10,700 photographs as a record of what the planet looked like in the last decade of the 20th century. He said, \\"I hope that many of the areas will be photographed again in 10 years' time from exactly the same positions\\". In November 1995, Smith climbed the most remote of the seven summits, Carstensz Pyramid in Irian Jaya with Peter Hillary and Greg Mortimer. In February 2000, Smith and his co-pilot John Wallington became the first people to successfully complete an east‚Äìwest crossing of the Tasman Sea by balloon, from New Zealand to Australia against generally prevailing winds. By November 2005, Smith had accumulated 8,500 hours total pilot time including over 1,000 hours single pilot jet time. forward by Max Hazelton On 7 January 2006, Smith flew his Cessna Grand Caravan from Sydney to Hari Hari on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island to mark the 75th anniversary of the first solo trans-Tasman flight by Guy Menzies in 1931. On Tuesday 26 August 2008, Smith, with his wife Pip, completed a two- and-a-half-year drive around the world. The journey of 40,361 kilometres was made by road vehicle. Business ventures =Electronics= In 1968, with a A$610 investment by him and his then fianc√©e Pip, Smith founded Dick Smith Car Radios, a small taxi radio repair business in the Sydney suburb of Neutral Bay, New South Wales, then later expanded into the car radio business at Gore Hill, naming himself the \\"Car-Radio 'Nut'\\". This business later became electronics retailer Dick Smith Electronics which grew rapidly in the late-1970s, particularly through sales of Citizens Band radios and then personal computers, with annual sales of about A$17 million by 1978. Smith took the business into Asia in 1978, opening a store in Ashley Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong's tourist shopping hub, and publishing an international catalogue edition until the store closed in 1980. That year, stores were also opened in Northern California and Los Angeles. In 1980, he sold the business to Woolworths for A$25 million. Though Smith retained no shares nor role in the company after 1982, the business continued to trade with his name prominently displayed in every aspect of its operations. Sales reached A$1.4 billion in 2014, before a sharp decline and closure of its then hundreds of stores in Australia and New Zealand by May 2016. =Publishing and film= Australian Geographic In 1986, Smith founded Australian Geographic Pty Ltd, which published the Australian Geographic magazine, a National Geographic-style magazine focusing on Australia. Smith did not want to greatly expand Australian Geographic, but his friend and CEO Ike Bain persuaded him to change his mind and soon it was a successful business. He sold the business to Fairfax Media in 1995 for A$41 million. Film production Smith co- produced the documentary First Contact, in 1983, recounting the discovery, in 1930, of a flourishing native population in the interior highlands of New Guinea. The film went on to win Best Feature Documentary at the 1983 Australian Film Institute Awards and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. =Australian products= Smith has had a keenly pro-Australian business philosophy going back as far as 1975 when, faced with an invasion by the relative juggernaut Tandy of the United States into the local electronics business, he complained > \\"Tandy are prepared to operate for a period of five years at a financial > loss to set up in Australia ... This is not free enterprise, it is not > competition, it is totally unfair ... why should a foreign firm be allowed > by the Australian Government to take over the Australian market from the > Australian people and remain 99 per cent foreign-owned?\\" He subsequently added \\"Proud to be Australian\\" prominently in Dick Smith Electronics promotional material and several years later flew an enormous Australian flag outside new headquarters in North Ryde, featuring the image on the cover of the company's 1980 catalogue. In 1979, Smith signed contracts to purchase the iconic Birdsville Hotel only to be stymied by a fire which burned the building down the next day. Smith founded Dick Smith Foods in 1999, a crusade against foreign ownership of Australian food producers, particularly Arnott's Biscuits, which in 1997 became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company. Dick Smith Foods only sold foods produced in Australia by Australian-owned companies and all profits went to charity. Dick Smith Foods' products were often named to parody the items with which they competed ‚Äì for example, in competition with Redheads matches, Smith sold near- identically packaged matches called \\"Dickheads\\" with the text on the rear stating \\"We would have to be complete dickheads to let most of our famous Australian brands be taken over by foreign companies. Brands such as Vegemite, Aeroplane Jelly, Arnott's, Speedo and Redhead Matches are in overseas hands. This means the profit and wealth created goes overseas and robs our children and grandchildren of a future.\\"Patrick Barkham. Aussie icons under siege, guardian.co.uk, Monday 26 February 2001. A chocolate biscuit called \\"Temptin'\\" competed directly with the established favourite Arnott's Tim Tam. In 2003, Arnott's took legal action against Dick Smith Foods, resulting in an out-of- court settlement that required the \\"p\\" in the Temptin' logo to be increased in size. In 2018, Smith announced closure of the business in 2019, having distributed over A$10 million in profits to charity, citing aggressive competition from German-owned Aldi through a strategy including low-cost imports notwithstanding Aldi's claim to operate an Australian-first buying policy. =Aviation regulation reformist= Smith has been a vocal advocate for the civil aviation industry in Australia, having been appointed by Prime Minister Bob Hawke to be Chairman of the Board of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) from February 1990 to February 1992. He also served as Deputy-Chairman and Chairman of the Board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA, the CAA's regulatory successor after the 1995 de-merger of the government's aviation operations including air traffic control) from 1997 until his resignation in 1999. During his CAA tenure, a comprehensive reform plan (including the Class G Demonstration airspace reform) was devised to improve safety, streamline bureaucracy and reduce costs but, facing opposition from the incumbent commercial operators, particularly Qantas and Ansett, it was never implemented. Smith claimed this was because there was resistance to increased competition in the market. Smith faced the same obstacles as head of CASA and left, concluding that his work there had failed. Smith has campaigned ever since for the reining in of over-regulation of the industry, particularly of flight training operators where layers of compliance costs associated with instructor status, approvals to carry out training and aircraft airworthiness have been blamed for ultimately crippling the Australian aviation industry. In October 2015, he recommended a mass exit from the industry: \\"I absolutely recommend that people get out of aviation as quickly as they can, sell up their businesses and close down ...\\"Dick Smith recommends mass industry exit Pro Aviation.

In the 1970s, Smith appeared on a pogo stick on various television programs, including Channel 9's Chris Kirby Show, as a promotional gimmick. In the early 1980s, Dick Smith organised the humorous promotional stunt in which a London double-decker bus jumped 16 motorcycles, an inversion of Evel Knievel's 1979 motorcycle jump over buses during an Australian visit. The bus was driven by adventurer Hans Tholstrup and Smith, who had been set up as its conductor, decided at the last minute to stay on board during the jump. Writing In 1980, Smith provided the research for Kookaburra, the most compelling story in Australia's aviation history, written by Pedr Davis. In 1983, Smith's The Earth Beneath Me, which described the first two-thirds, from the US to Sydney, of his solo helicopter flight around the world, was published. Two documentaries were also filmed during the flight, and a third one soon after. In 1984, Smith authored a 79-page booklet arguing the need for an independent committee of review into the Department of Aviation. He urged the establishment of the Aviation Committee of Review Proposal (ACORP). Smith's Our Fantastic Planet: Circling the globe via the poles, published in 1991, is his account of his Twin Otter circumnavigation. In his 1992 work, \\"Dick Smith Solo Around the World\\", he writes of his round the world flight in his Jetranger helicopter and first successful helicopter flight to the North Pole. In 1997, Smith covered his latest helicopter circumnavigation of the world, this time east to west in a Sikorsky, in his Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation. In June 2011, his polemic challenging the growth is good principle, Dick Smith's Population Crisis: The dangers of unsustainable growth for Australia was published. In December 2015, Smith's book, Balls Pyramid: Climbing the World's Tallest Sea Stack, a comprehensive and detailed history of climbs, including his own, on this remote and uniquely spectacular tall volcanic remnant 20 km south-west of Lord Howe Island, was published. Philanthropy Having achieved success in his business, Smith started making charitable donations in 1971, the first notable one being to Dr Antony Kidman, father of Nicole Kidman. Beginning with his first charter in February 1977, Smith's Antarctic flights (operated by QANTAS) had raised A$70,000 for charities including the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife (then of New South Wales) and Australian Museum over the following year. Many other charities followed Smith's lead in using Antarctic charters as a fundraising tool. In 1985, Smith conceived, organised and led the first of what was to become a major annual motoring event, the B to B Bash, the proceeds of which go to the Children's Charity, Variety. Smith's Bourke to Burketown route through remote areas of the Outback raised A$250,000 while a total of over A$200 million has been raised for the charity by the event in the past 30 years. In the 1980s, Smith gave millions to Life Education Centres which taught schoolchildren about the health effects of smoking, alcohol, and narcotics. In 1988, he published and distributed over 100,000 copies of Truth an Ad magazine delivering that message, and ran anti- tobacco industry ads in newspapers. He faulted tobacco and alcohol advertising for falsely linking them to youth, sophistication and success. Smith said at the time, \\"The most successful people, I find, generally don't drink. Now if you're constantly seeing ads showing the opposite, that's dishonest.\\" In 1987, Smith established the Australian Geographic Society Adventure Awards and is patron of the Society. As its chairman, he initiated and led the restoration of polar adventurer Sir Hubert Wilkins' childhood home near Mt Bryan, South Australia, a nine-year project completed in 2001. By 2005, Smith had made donations totalling at least A$15 million. Smith was reported, in 2007, to have contributed A$1 million to charities in each of the 24 years since selling his electronics business and, in 2018, the Weekend Australian reported that Smith had continued to do so every year since. In June 2010, Smith provided A$1 million to The Salvation Army for purchase of three houses for the homeless. In April 2013, Smith donated A$1 million to the Australian Lions Foundation for their compassionate grants programme. Through the Dick Smith Foods Foundation, A$1 million was donated to charities in 2014, in the Charity Breakthrough pledge. Smith donated A$1 million to Rotary Australia World Community Service in his charitable distribution of the A$4,170,412 proceeds of sale of his Cessna Citation CJ3 jet in December 2016. Other substantial donations were made to The Scout Association of Australia, Wild Care Inc. of Tasmania and the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation, among numerous others. The construction of an orphanage and library at Onaba, in the Panjshir Valley, Afghanistan, was substantially funded by Smith. In October 2017, Smith made a A$250,000 donation to the Namatjira Legacy Trust as part of a settlement negotiated by him for transfer from commercial interests of all copyright in the works of Albert Namatjira, to the benefit of Namatjira's descendants and the Aboriginal community at large. Namatjira was a leading Aboriginal artist of the 1950s and the first Australian Aboriginal to be granted citizenship. In June 2018, Smith, on behalf of Dick Smith Foods, donated A$1 million to the Country Women's Association after a visit to the country town of Tooraweenah. In August 2019, Smith repeated his 2016 donation of A$1 million to Rotary Australia, to alleviate suffering of the needy. Smith has been consistently openly critical of tax evasion by the wealthy and their failure to be active in philanthropy, cajoling billionaires Rupert Murdoch and Harry Triguboff to do more. Involvement in public affairs In addition to his two terms of office heading the Australian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Civil Aviation Safety Authority in the 1990s, Smith has engaged in a diverse range of civic activities. Smith is a founder and a patron of the Australian Skeptics. In July 1980, Smith collaborated with renowned sceptic James Randi to test water divining, offering a prize of A$40,000 for a successful demonstration. Within days of Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's 1995 parliamentary announcement of his intention to make Australia a republic by 2001, public opinion was found to favour Smith as the nation's first president. Then Prime Minister John Howard appointed Smith founding Chairman of the National Council for the Centenary of Federation in December 1996 and he served till February 2000. In 2005, Dick Smith gave public support to the asylum seeker Peter Qasim. Qasim was released later in 2005 by the Australian Government after seven years in detention. This support included the offer to visit India seeking evidence of Qasim's claims. In June 2008, he offered a A$50,000 award for investigative journalism into the Government purchase of Super Seasprite helicopters, after the contract was cancelled at a cost of A$1.1 billion. In response to a large increase in pertussis cases during a 2008/09 outbreak, Smith funded a national ad in The Australian encouraging parents to \\"Get The Facts\\" and derided the Australian Vaccination Network as an anti-vaccination organisation. In November 2009, he paid a large share of the ransom to free Australian photojournalist Nigel Brennan and Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout who were both being held hostage in Somalia. In February 2012, Smith expressed himself skeptical of the purported Energy Catalyzer Cold fusion device. On 14 February, he offered the inventor Andrea Rossi US$1 million if he were to repeat the demonstration of 29 March of the year before, this time allowing particular care to be given to a check of the electric wiring of the device, and to the power output. The offer was declined by Rossi before the lapse of 20 February acceptance deadline that had been set by Smith.E-Cat Proof Challenge: $1,000,000 is a \\"Clownerie\\"? (Updated), Forbes, February 2012, downloaded 19 February 2012 Smith subsequently offered US$1 million \\"to any person or organisation that can come up with a practical device that has an output of at least one kilowatt of useful energy through LENRs (low energy nuclear reactions).\\" The offer remained open, unclaimed, until January 2013.US $1 Million Reward for First Successful One Kilowatt or More LENR Demonstration , Retrieved 3 July 2012  Political activism and conservation In 1989, Smith offered an A$25,000 reward for discovery, dead or alive, of the elusive Australian night parrot. A dead specimen was found the next year by three ornithologists, associated with the Australian Museum, who claimed the prize and efforts to find living specimens were sparked. Eventually, in 2013, the first confirmed sighting in over a century was confirmed. Smith donated A$60,000 in February 2007 towards a campaign to secure a fair trial for then Australian terrorism suspect David Hicks who had been held in a U.S. military prison in Cuba's Guantanamo Bay for five years. Smith said he wanted Hicks to get \\"a fair trial, a fair go\\". Fresh charges, including attempted murder, had been filed against Hicks earlier that month. Hicks pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in March 2007 as part of a plea bargain, and was released from custody in December 2007. Smith, together with two others, offered to financially assist Australian Greens leader Bob Brown to satisfy a A$240,000 costs order after Brown lost an anti-logging case he brought against Forestry Tasmania. A failure to pay would have resulted in Brown having to declare bankruptcy, and therefore lose his seat in the Senate. In 2011, Dick Smith expressed support for action on climate change, including the introduction of a carbon tax, and criticized the response to actor Cate Blanchett speaking out on the matter. He stated that \\"in their editorials [News Limited journalists] say they accept that human-induced climate change is a real danger ... yet their news pages and opinion pieces are full of endless attacks on politicians and others who support putting a price on carbon.\\" In 2013, Smith released a documentary, Ten Bucks a Litre, profiling Australia's current energy sources and future options. Narrated by Smith and featuring him at spectacular mining and power generation locations across the country and abroad, the documentary called for urgent action to replace fossil fuels with renewables and concluded that nuclear would be the only solution if energy consumption did not go down. Smith explained his positive position on nuclear power generation in a 21 July 2017 interview with former Labour Party leader Mark Latham, citing France as having been particularly successful, but conceded that public opinion in Australia had been so tainted and was so irrational that there was little prospect of a plant ever being built there. =Aboriginal reconciliation= As chairman of the National Centenary of Federation Council (1996‚Äì2000), an appointment made by then Prime Minister John Howard, Smith advocated renaming 26 January, Australia Day (which commemorates the arrival of the first fleet of British settlers in 1788), as \\"First Fleet Day\\" in recognition of the fact it was not a day for celebration by all Australians. = Population policy activism = In August 2010, Smith announced he would be devoting himself to questions of global population, overpopulation, and alternatives to an endless economic growth economy. He produced and appeared in the feature-length documentary Dick Smith's Population Puzzle (Download Transcript-PDF-511Kb) broadcast by public network the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, questioning the desirability of Australia's rapid population growth. In the documentary, Smith called the campaign the most important thing he had ever done in his life. It was subsequently distributed on DVD. The same year, he established the production company Smith&Nasht; with producer Simon Nasht. In August 2010, he announced the Wilberforce Award of A$1 million to any person under 30 who could attract his attention by advocating alternatives to population and consumption growth. In May 2011, Dick Smith published his book on the subject, Dick Smith's Population Crisis: The dangers of unsustainable growth for Australia. In 2013, Smith&Nasht; revisited the topic of overpopulation with the release of an hour-long documentary film called The Vasectomist. On 6 December 2016, Smith spoke in support of the One Nation party's policy of reducing immigration to historical levels of about 70,000 per annum whilst at the same time rejecting its leader Pauline Hanson's call for a Muslim ban. Smith described himself as pro-immigration but cautioned that the very high rates of immigration which began under Prime Minister John Howard would increase population beyond carrying capacity, causing high rates of unemployment and even greater wealth disparity, leading to discontent and, ultimately, violence. In September 2017, Smith was reported to have joined the Sustainable Australia party. = The Dick Smith Party = In March 2015, the media announced that Dick Smith had registered The Dick Smith Party, but would not be running as a candidate himself. The party stated it intended to focus on the Senate and would run on a platform of curbing unnecessary regulation and population growth. Smith is opposed to Australia's \\"ridiculously huge\\" rates of immigration on grounds of environmental sustainability.Stiles, Jackson. Launch of Political Party The New Daily. Retrieved 6 May 2015 =Dick Smith Fair Go= On 15 August 2017, Smith launched his \\"Fair Go Campaign\\" to pressure Australia's major political parties to incorporate population policy into their platforms and to radically increase taxation on the rich and corporates. His plan included tax increases for the wealthiest 1% and that the Norwegian model of publishing lists of top taxpayers be adopted. He was reported to have spent A$1 million on promoting the campaign through television advertising. He also pledged to spend another A$2 million on promoting population policy at the next Federal election if no major party would commit to reducing immigration to 70,000 per annum from a level then averaging in excess of 200,000. The Fair Go Campaign called for a more than 50% increase in places for refugees in the annual immigration quota. The campaign quickly matured into a permanent presence as the Dick Smith Fair Go Group which also agitates for economic reforms to tackle income inequality and a return to affordable housing. Smith criticised the Liberal Party government's policy of paying beneficiaries of self-managed superannuation funds rebates for franking credits created upon payment of profits tax by the underlying investee corporations. He expressed horror when receiving A$500,000 from the government and called for the scheme to be reformed to stop \\"outrageous\\" payouts to the wealthy. The tax commissioner remarked that never before had someone asked him if they could pay more tax. Awards and honours Smith was awarded the Baden-Powell Award in 1966, the highest award in the Rover Section, after 14 years in the Scouting movement. In 1983, Smith was the UK's Honourable Company of Air Pilots Sword of Honour recipient for his \\"outstanding contribution to General Aviation\\". The same year, he received the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for \\"a most brilliant performance in the air by an Australian\\", conferred by the Royal Federation of Aero Clubs of Australia. Smith was awarded Australian of the Year in 1986. At Smith's Australian of the Year Presentation he suggested that publisher Rupert Murdoch might like to take a year off, come back to Australia and share some of his expertise by heading the Treasury or the Reserve Bank.1960‚Äì2010 Australians of the Year, Murdoch Books Australia, In 1992, Smith received the United States' Lindbergh award.\\"Lindbergh Award, Dick Smith (1992)\\".

The Australian Government honoured Smith with the Centenary Medal in 2001 for \\"service to the Centenary of Federation celebrations\\". The Bulletin magazine, then Australia's longest running, named Smith on its 2006 list of 100 Most Influential Australians, with Rupert Murdoch, Shane Warne, Peter Weir, Bill Wentworth, Patrick White and Gough Whitlam. The Explorers Club, of which he is an International Fellow, awarded Smith the Lowell Thomas Award in 2008 for outstanding exploration, themed that year \\"Exploring Earth From Above\\". He was one of six awardees including legendary aviator Chuck Yeager. In 2010, Smith was the Patron for the 100th Anniversary of the Wireless Institute of Australia, including being the major speaker at the annual general meeting in Canberra on 27 May 2010.

Saturnalia (, \\"Seven Books of the Saturnalia\\") is a work written after 431 AD by the Roman provincial Macrobius Theodosius (b. 390 AD - d. ?). The Saturnalia consists of an account of the discussions held at the house of Vettius Agorius Praetextatus during the holiday of the Saturnalia. It contains a great variety of curious historical, mythological, critical, antiquarian and grammatical discussions. \\"The work takes the form of a series of dialogues among learned men at a fictional banquet.\\" There is little attempt to give any dramatic character to the dialogue; in each book some one of the personages takes the leading part, and the remarks of the others serve only as occasions for calling forth fresh displays of erudition. Contents The first book is devoted to an inquiry as to the origin of the Saturnalia and the festivals of Janus, which leads to a history and discussion of the Roman calendar, and to an attempt to derive all forms of worship from that of the Sun. The second book begins with a collection of bons mots, to which all present make their contributions, many of them being ascribed to Cicero and Augustus; a discussion of various pleasures, especially of the senses, then seems to have taken place, but almost the whole of this is lost. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth books are devoted to Virgil, dwelling respectively on his learning in religious matters, his rhetorical skill, his debt to Homer (with a comparison of the art of the two) and to other Greek writers, and the nature and extent of his borrowings from the earlier Latin poets. The latter part of the third book is taken up with a dissertation upon luxury and the sumptuary laws intended to check it, which is probably a dislocated portion of the second book. The seventh book consists largely of the discussion of various physiological questions. The primary value of the work lies in the facts and opinions quoted from earlier writers. The form of the Saturnalia is copied from Plato's Symposium and Gellius's Noctes atticae; the chief authorities (whose names, however, are not quoted) are Gellius, Seneca the philosopher, Plutarch (Quaestiones conviviales), Athenaeus and the commentaries of Servius and others on Virgil.

Shobdon Court service block Bateman was the eldest son of William Bateman, 1st Viscount Bateman MP and his wife Lady Anne Spencer, daughter of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, and granddaughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. In December 1744 on the death of his father, he succeeded as second Viscount Bateman. He married Elizabeth Sambroke, daughter of John Sambroke, MP on 2 July 1748. The property Bateman inherited from his father (Shobdon Court, Herefordshire) gave him a parliamentary interest at Leominster and he was connected with the Marlborough, Bedford, and Pelham families through his mother. As the viscountcy was in the Peerage of Ireland, it did not disqualify him for election to the House of Commons of Great Britain. Lord Bateman was returned unopposed on the Treasury interest as Member of Parliament for Orford at a by-election on 31 January 1746. At the 1747 general election he was returned unopposed as MP for Woodstock on the interest of his uncle Charles, Duke of Marlborough. Bateman was re-elected at Woodstock in 1754 and became Lord of the Admiralty in 1755 until 1756 when he was appointed Treasurer of the Household. He was appointed to the Privy Council on 19 November 1756. In 1761 he was again returned to Parliament for Woodstock. At the 1768 general election, the seat at Woodstock was required for Lord Robert Spencer, so instead, Bateman stood on his own interest at Leominster where he was returned unopposed. He was returned unopposed for Leominster again in 1774 and 1780. He stood down at the 1784 general election. Lord Bateman was made Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire in 1747, holding the post until his death. He was Master of the Buckhounds from 1757 to March 1782 and High steward of Leominster from 1759 to his death. Resident at Shobdon Court he was responsible for the complete rebuilding of St John's Church between 1749‚Äì52. On his death in 1802 at the age of eighty, the viscountcy became extinct. Shobdon Court passed to a relative, William Hanbury, who was created Baron Bateman in 1837 and adopted the surname of Bateman-Hanbury.

He selected a deaf and dumb boy, Thomas Collins, for tuition. After devoting his leisure hours, for a few months, to the partial education of the boy at his own house, Dr. Orpen gave a few popular lectures at the Rotunda, in which he brought forward the most striking features in the condition of the Deaf, and the principal facts with respect to the history of their education, as a science recently invented, and the establishment of schools in various countries for their relief. Collins' progress in written language, in calculation, and in articulate speech, after only a few months' instruction, was so satisfactory that the cause of the Deaf was immediately taken up by the public. The National Institution for Education of the Deaf and Dumb Poor in Ireland was formed shortly afterwards.

He recognized that a new urban ministry was needed in parts of the city with growing numbers of immigrants. He instituted social service programs as well as altering church interiors to make people feel more welcome.  Personal life and education  Born March 1, 1800, in Newburyport, Massachusetts, to Dudley Atkins Tyng and Sarah Higginson (and the brother of sea captain, merchant, and memoirist Charles Tyng), Stephen Tyng attended Phillips Andover Academy and was graduated from Harvard University in 1817. It was there that Tyng had a strong conversion experience that led him to leave business to pursue the ministry. He then headed to Bristol, RI to study theology and prepare for ordination under Bishop Griswold. Later, the degree of D.D. was conferred upon him by Jefferson College of Philadelphia in 1832, and by Harvard University in 1851.Barratt, Norris Stanley. \\"Outline of the History of Old St. Paul's Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: With an Appeal for Its Preservation, Together with Articles of Agreement, Abstract of Title, List of Rectors, Vestrymen, and Inscriptions of Tombstones and Vaults\\". Colonial Society of Philadelphia, 1918. p. 135, 138. Tyng married his first wife, Anne DeWolf Griswold (daughter of his mentor), in 1821. Together, they had four children: Anna Elizabeth, Dudley Atkins, Alexander Griswold, and Julia Griswold. She died on May 16, 1832, at 27 years of age and was buried in the churchyard of the Church of the Epiphany. He soon thereafter married Susan Wilson Mitchell in 1833. This marriage produced an additional four children: Thomas Mitchell, Stephen Higginson, Morris Ashurst, and Charles Rockland. It was his last son who wrote and published his biography \\"Record of the life and work of the Rev. Stephen Higginson Tyng, D.D. and history of St. George's Church, New York, to the close of his rectorship\\" in 1890. Dr. Tyng died on September 3, 1885, in Irvington-on-Hudson and is buried with his late wife and children at Green- Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.  Career  Burning of Tyng's new St. George Church (November 14, 1865) Tyng was considered to be one of the most notable preachers of the time, and leader in the evangelical party of the Episcopal Church. He was also well connected to other leading Evangelical Episcopalians such as Bishop McIlvaine of Ohio, with whom he shared extensive correspondence throughout his career. Tyng began his career with short stints as rector of St. George's, Georgetown and Queen Anne Parish, Maryland before being called as rector to \\"Old\\" St. Paul's Church in Philadelphia. At the time, it was a prominent congregation well ensconced in the evangelical party (he was preceded there by the Rev. Benjamin Allen) and a sign of the young man's great promise as a preacher and presbyter. He was instrumental in renovating the church building to accommodate Sunday school rooms as he was an early proponent of Christian education. Tyng remained at St. Paul's until 1833 when the fledgling Church of the Epiphany called him to be their first rector. Over the next 11 years, he grew the church tremendously until his departure in 1845. He was called to St. George's Episcopal Church to become their next rector in 1845 and remained there for 33 years until retiring in 1878 as rector emeritus. Initially St. George's was affiliated with Trinity Church and located in Lower Manhattan at Beekman and Cliff streets, near Wall Street. During that time, Tyng converted J.P. Morgan to the faith and he in turn helped build a new church on East 16th Street and Rutherford Place, facing Stuyvesant Square in New York. Under Tyng, the new St. George served the rich and the poor together, with 2,000 children in its Sunday School, and funds raised and sent to four churches in Africa and a school in Moravia . In 1865 the church suffered a major fire and Tyng supervised reconstruction after a fire.Burrows & Wallace, p.1171 Under his instructions, the interior of the rebuilt church reflected his views: the altar, for instance, was a plain communion table., p.190 The architect supervising the interior remodeling was Leopold Eidlitz., pp.85-86, p. 209 He was the author of numerous pamphlets and publications, and was actively involved in several Episcopal organizations such as the Evangelical Knowledge Society, the American Church Missionary Society, and the Episcopal Education Society. He was also publisher for a time of Episcopal Recorder (the evangelical party newspaper) and Protestant Churchman.  Legacy  Tyng's first son, Dudley Atkins, followed in his father's footsteps both as an Episcopal clergyman and by becoming rector of Church of the Epiphany in Philadelphia. He was an outspoken abolitionist who was ultimately ousted from that pulpit for his views. In 1857 Philadelphia was in the midst of a revival and, while visiting a barn on his property, his sleeve became caught in a piece of machinery and resulted in extensive injury. On his deathbed, he asked his father to remind the revivalist to \\"let us all stand up for Jesus.\\" These parting words became the inspiration for the instantly popular new hymn, \\"Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus\\" written by family friend and Presbyterian minister George Duffield Jr. Tyng's fourth son, also named Stephen Higginson Tyng, was an Episcopal clergyman and founded in 1874 the now demolished Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, commonly referred to as Dr. Tyng's Church; it was located on the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street, \\"just a block from Grand Central Station.\\" Tyng used the same architect as his father had (Leopold Eidlitz) for a High Victorian hybrid design of the German Romanesque. He was described as the \\"hardworking churchman, the younger Stephen H. Tyng, who organized it in 1874.\\"Nathan Silver, Lost New York, (New York: Weathervane Books, 1967), p.149 In 1895 the parish merged with St. James's Episcopal Church, and Holy Trinity was deconsecrated, sold and demolished.Church of the Holy Trinity (Episcopal), American Guild of Organists New York City Chapter.

Thompson served as an officer in the militia during the War of 1812 and was a contractor during the construction of the first Welland Canal. Originally from Wainfleet, Thompson moved to Haldimand County in the 1830's, attracted by the commercial opportunities of the Grand River. With William Hamilton Merritt, Thompson was a promoter of the Grand River Navigation Company, an enterprise which transformed the Grand River into a navigable waterway for commercial activity between Brantford and Lake Erie.Ontario Heritage Trust: Ruthven Estate.Ruthven Park National Historic Site: Ruthven Park‚Äôs History. Thompson was involved in laying out the 1,200 acre town of Indiana. He eventually owned two sawmills, a gristmill and a carding mill, a cooperage, and a number of stores. By the mid-19th century, Indiana was the largest industrial town in Haldimand County. In the late 1840s, Thompson cleared land and built his home on what would later be known as the Ruthven Park. The 10,000 square foot house, built in the Greek revival style,Canada's Historic Places: Ruthven Park National Historic Site of Canada. was to stay in the possession of the Thompson family until the 1990s. In 1995 it was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. In 1996, the Ontario Heritage Trust obtained a heritage easement to protect the building. The Province of Canada was created in 1841 from the union of Upper Canada and Lower Canada. Thompson was elected to the new Legislative Assembly as a Reformer in the general election of 1841, for the Haldimand riding.

Member of the Usta≈°e, he was the Minister of Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia from 29 January to 30 August 1944, succeeding Miroslav Navratil. Vokiƒá was one of the leaders of the 1944 Lorkoviƒá‚ÄìVokiƒá plot, an attempt to align the country with the Allies and against the Axis powers. After the plot was uncovered, Vokiƒá was arrested and later executed. Biography =Youth= Vokiƒá was born in Mostar on 23 August 1909. He attended a gymnasium in Sarajevo and studied Law at University of Zagreb. He ended his studies in 1929 and started working for the train service in Sarajevo. He co-founded the Croatian Academic Club Kranjƒçeviƒá and the newspaper Svijest (Consciousness) and participated in the HKD Napredak. =World War II= Before the establishment of the Croatian state, Vokiƒá was a member of the Usta≈°e branch in Zagreb. On 11 April 1941, by order of Slavko Kvaternik, he was sent to serve at the headquarters of the Usta≈°ka Nadzorna Slu≈æba (Ustasha Surveillance Service), whose main task was to lead and build up existing Usta≈°a combat formations and form new ones. Later that year he was appointed Director of Train Services in Sarajevo. He was an organising commander of all Usta≈°a traffic brigades. An associate of Jure Francetiƒá, he was a founding member of Crna Legija (Black Legion). In 1943 he left Sarajevo and moved to Zagreb and on 11 October of that year he was appointed Minister of Traffic. At the suggestion of Mladen Lorkoviƒá, he was promoted to the Usta≈°e rank of colonel and named minister of the Armed Forces on 29 January 1944, without the approval of German ambassador Siegfried Kasche and German military attache Edmund Glaise von Horstenau. On 13 July 1944 Ante Paveliƒá promoted him to the highest rank, that of Krilnik (Brigadier General). He became a close associate and friend of Mladen Lorkoviƒá. Lorkoviƒá introduced him to Baroness Vraniczany and Baroness Zlata Lubienski, members of high society, who became his good friends. At the beginning of August 1944, he stood as best man at the marriage of Lorkoviƒá to Countess Nada Von Ghyczy. Lorkoviƒá-Vokiƒá plot Vokiƒá visits Croatian volunteers in Stockerau Together with Mladen Lorkoviƒá, Vokiƒá led a coup dubbed the Lorkoviƒá-Vokiƒá plot. The coup's goal was for Croatia to switch sides in the war by declaring war on Nazi Germany and entering an alliance with Anglo-American allies. He visited the Domobran and Usta≈°e units and their officers and said they should expect a big event. He received support from the Domobran officers and lost favour with the Usta≈°e, who were loyal to Ante Paveliƒá. He contacted Ivan Faroli, lawyer for Vladko Maƒçek, the president of the Croatian Peasant Party. He informed Faroli about a coup to bring down the Usta≈°e and give power to the Croatian Peasant Party. This included the replacement of Usta≈°e's officers with Domobran officers, loyal to the Croatian Peasant Party and disarmament of German units on Croatian territory. Later Paveliƒá was visited by a Gestapo officer and told about Germany's new (V2) weapons which would turn the war in its favour. On 21 August 1944, Paveliƒá informed Siegfried Kasche about the coup and announced actions against the putschists. He also accused German general Edmund Glaise von Horstenau of involvement in the coup, because von Horstenau was coaxing Paveliƒá to approve the coup.Markoviƒá, Marko. Jure i Boban - Povijest Crne legije, Zagreb, MBF Publishing (2003) Vokiƒá's friend, Ante ≈†titiƒá, a high ranking police official who was also involved in the coup, wrote a report after meetings with Lorkoviƒá (24 August 1944) and Vokiƒá (25 August 1944). He handed the report to the Usta≈°e units commander, Ivo Herenƒçiƒá, an old opponent of Vokiƒá. Herenƒçiƒá gave the report to Paveliƒá. That report was the main evidence presented against Vokiƒá and Lorkoviƒá at their trial for \\"high treason\\". =Death= At a sudden government assembly on 30 August 1944, Vokiƒá and Lorkoviƒá were accused of conspiring against Paveliƒá and his Croatian allies, mainly Nazi Germany. They were removed the same day from their duties and placed under house arrest. Lorkoviƒá and Vokiƒá were brought in front of Poglavnik's Bodyguard Unit court. They convicted him, stripped him of his rank and expelled him from the unit. He was later interned in Novi Marof; from there he was moved to Koprivnica with Lorkoviƒá. He was then jailed in Lepoglava prison and on 8 May 1945, the day Germany surrendered, Vokiƒá was executed. References Sources * Zdravko Dizdar.

Chaser worked with Professor John W. Pilley, at his home in Spartanburg, South Carolina, from eight weeks old, until Pilley's death in June 2018. Pilley spent that time training her in a formal research project. Chaser could identify and retrieve 1,022 toys by name. Background Chaser had the largest tested memory of any non-human animal. She was bred by Wayne West at his Fleet Hill Farms in Pauline, South Carolina. She was taught by her owner, Wofford College Professor Emeritus of Psychology John W. Pilley, with the formal research published in Elsevier's journals Behavioural Processes and Learning and Motivation.  Memory study  Chaser could identify and retrieve 1,022 toys by name, which was the foundation for her vocabulary. She began to understand that objects have names at five months of age. At this point, she became able to pair a novel object with a novel name in only one trial, although rehearsal was necessary to log it into her long term memory. She recognized common nouns such as house, tree and ball, as well as adverbs, verbs and prepositional objects. Based on that learning, she and her owner and trainer Pilley continued her training, demonstrating her ability to understand sentences with multiple elements of grammar and to learn new behaviors by imitation. Chaser could also learn new words by \\"inferential reasoning by exclusion\\", that is, inferring the name of a new object by excluding objects whose names she already knew.  Documentary  Chaser and Professor Pilley were also featured in the documentary film Seniors A Dogumentary from director Gorman Bechard. The film premiered in March 2020 at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville, and was released on DVD and pay-per-view in September 2020.

Early activities Al-Qasim bin Ali was a Sayyid from Tarj in the Khath'am region (present-day south-western Saudi Arabia). His year of birth is (doubtfully) given as 922 or 928. He was a great-great-grandson of al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860), a key figure in the emerging of the Zaydiyyah brand of Shi'a Islam.The line of descent is: al-Qasim ar-Rassi ‚Äì Abu Abdallah Muhammad ‚Äì Abdallah ‚Äì Ali ‚Äì al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani. He received a reputation for religious learning from early age. For decades, Zaidi figures from Yemen visited him and asked him to intervene in the Yemeni highland. After the death of the Zaidi imam an-Nasir Ahmad in 934, political conditions had been unstable in the Zaydiyyah-influenced areas. In 993, al-Qasim proclaimed the imamate in Tihamah, but his movement was defeated in the next year by the governor of Mecca. Still, the Fatimid caliph treated al-Qasim with respect and courtesy. Imam in Yemen Al-Qasim invaded Yemen in 997 or 998 and appropriated Sa'dah, the traditional capital of the Zaydiyyah domain. As imam he was known as al-Mansur a-Qasim. He subsequently returned to Tarj, and his power in Yemen immediately crumbled. He then returned again, permanently, in 999. This time he was able to extend his power over an extensive area from Bilad Khath to San'a. However, he could not secure an outlet to the sea, and the lowland of Yemen was subjected to the Ziyadid dynasty in Zabid. Al-Mansur al-Qasim resided in Iyyan (Ayyan), south-east of Sad'ah, and therefore became known as al-Iyyani. He called on certain tribes to perform military service. One of his adherents composed a poem which emphasized the enthusiastic response among the tribesmen, and the role of the imam as a restorer: \\"Rise and lead the people, and send them with justice; remove darkness and ignorance from them. Restore the religion of your ancestor after it had disappeared, and inflict death upon your opponents.\\"Ella Landau-Tasseron, 'Zaydi Imams as Restorers of Religion; Ihya and Tajdid in Zaydi Literature', Journal of Near Eastern Studies 49:3 1990, p. 258. Abdication His position was nevertheless precarious, since other Rassids (descendants of al-Qasim ar- Rassi) claimed power over the Zaydiyyah community. After his failure to subdue the recalcitrant tribesmen of Banu Harith in Najran, he faced opposition from al-Malih Ibrahim and the former imam ad-Da'i Yusuf. The governor in Dhamar, az-Zaidi, rebelled and captured the imam's son Ja'far. A reconciliation took place in 1002. Az-Zaidi offered al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani to retain power over Bakil and Wada. The imam, however, preferred to retire from governance altogether. He lived a private life in Madhab and Iyyan where he wrote a text to his defence. He died in the following year in Iyyan. As a religious scholar, he followed al-Qasim ar-Rassi and al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya in the essentials, although he was also accused of theological deviations. After his death, the imamate was contested between his son al-Mahdi al-Husayn and the old imam ad-Da'i Yusuf.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82321 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Lomas in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Coast Guard Historian websiteScheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point Lomas was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Lomas included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scheina, p 72Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History Crews of Point Lomas and Point Orient prepare for an inspection at Da Nang Navy Base, 24 July 1965 After delivery in 1961, Point Lomas was assigned a homeport of Port Aransas, Texas, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. At the request of the United States Navy, in April 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 16 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 13Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Lomas was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines in May 1965 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single- sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four M2 machine guns. The original bow mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 Point Lomas was assigned to Division 12 of Squadron One to be based at Da Nang, along with , , , , , and .

Balsam has been filing lawsuits against spammers since 2002 and has earned over $1 million in court judgments. By filing lawsuits, Balsam aims to publicize the names of the principals who are profiting from spam advertising. He aims to make spamming less profitable and to cause companies to reconsider their decision to market products through spam. Balsam describes his practice as \\"cleaning up the Internet,\\" although his critics accuse him of taking advantage of the legal system. Legal practice Balsam decided to begin suing spammers after he became enraged by the volume of breast enlargement spam that he received while working in marketing. He began filing lawsuits in small claims court in 2002, initially seeing the lawsuits as a hobby. Balsam soon decided to make it his vocation and attended the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, from which he graduated in 2008. By the time he graduated from law school, Balsam had filed several dozen lawsuits. He files lawsuits based on the spam he receives at his e-mail addresses. He now makes enough money from court judgments to support himself full-time. With the help of his attorney, Timothy Walton, he has won judgments of $1,000 per e-mail. Because most spam messages do not identify the company sending the message, it is often difficult to identify the source. Balsam is frequently faced with fictitious business names registered to post office boxes. Balsam was once awarded a $1.125 million verdict against a pornography company that had sent him 1,125 e-mails. He was not able to collect the judgment, however, because the domain registrar Tucows refused to identify the owner of the company that had sent the spam. Most of Balsam's lawsuits are brought under California's anti-spam laws. Although many of his cases have been tried in small claims court, he filed the first spam lawsuit that was brought to trial in California Superior Court--Balsam v. Trancos Inc.--which is currently on appeal. Among the companies that Balsam has sued in small claims court are Various Inc. dba Adult FriendFinder, Tagged.com, Deniro Marketing LLC dba AmateurMatch, and the Stockton Asparagus Festival. Lobbying Balsam has been critical of the CAN-SPAM Act, arguing that it is not tough enough on spammers. He also believes that the U.S. government is not doing enough to enforce laws against spam. While still in law school, Balsam helped draft a bill (AB 2950) sponsored by California State Assemblyman Jared Huffman, which would have toughened California's anti-spam laws. The bill aimed to close what its proponents characterized as loopholes and tighten ambiguous language in Business & Professions Code 17529.5 to more clearly set forth what practices are unlawful, and to make it easier to bring lawsuits against deceptive spammers and spamvertisers. Although the bill passed the State Assembly, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it. Opposition Bennet Kelley, an Internet lawyer whom Balsam has faced in court, has been vocally critical of Balsam's tactics.Julie Watts for CBS San Francisco Consumer Watch, Dec. 28, 2010 Balsam also has been sued by ValueClick, Inc., twice and Bloosky Interactive, LLC, for allegedly violating settlement confidentiality and/or non-disparagement agreements very shortly after entering into a settlement. Balsam maintains that these suits are retaliatory.

History Noma Lighthouse was lit on March 10, 1921, and is the oldest lighthouse in Aichi Prefecture. In 2008, the lighthouse was extensively renovated, with its lens replaced by a 5th order Fresnel lens and light source replaced by LEDs. As a result, its output was decreased from approximately 15,000 candela to only 590 candela and effective range reduced from approximately 25 kilometers to 15 kilometers. The former lens is now on display at the museum at Dai≈çzaki Lighthouse in Mie Prefecture. Lock Superstition Noma Lighthouse in popular superstition was held to be a place that jinxed romance. However, there is a belief that if a couple attaches a padlock to the fence surrounding this lighthouse, their love will prosper. The lighthouse is surrounded by a 2-meter high steel fence but, as result of locks accumulating, the fence has collapsed on several occasions due to the weight. In the year 2000, Mihama Town declared the area around the lighthouse to be a park, and the established a small branch near the fence to receive the padlocks instead. In October 2011, the Nihon Fukushi University, also based in Mihama, set up a railing, designed as a musical score, as a place to also affix the padlocks.

Compared to the first iPad, as the second model in the iPad line, it gained a faster dual core A5 processor, a lighter build structure, and was the first iPad to feature VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The device was available initially with three storage sizes ‚Äì 16, 32, and 64 GB1 GB = 1 billion bytes ‚Äì and two varying connectivity options ‚Äì Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi and cellular. Each variation of the device is available with either a black or white front glass panel. However, upon the release of the 3rd generation iPad in March 2012, only the 16 GB variation remained available. The product became available in March through May 2011. The device received generally positive reception from various blogs and publications. Although it was praised for its hardware improvement, such as the new Apple A5 chip, the software restriction on the iPad 2 and iOS in general drew criticism from various technology commentators. The device sold well in its first month of sales with 2.4‚Äì2.6 million units sold and 11.12 million units were sold in the third quarter of 2011. A popular product, with a lower screen resolution and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry- level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. Its basic design formed the core of the first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. Originally shipped with iOS 4, with the release of iOS 9 the iPad 2 became the only device to have received six major versions of iOS. It kept that distinction until iOS 12 was released for the iPhone 5S, iPad Air and iPad Mini 2. This would later be surpassed by the iPad Air 2, receiving seven from iOS 8 to iPadOS 14. History The iPad 2 was announced at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on March 2, 2011. Apple sent invitations to journalists on February 23, 2011, for a media event on March 2. On March 2, 2011, CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the device at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, despite being on medical leave. Jobs announced that the iOS 5.0 operating system would be available March 9, 2011. Upon the announcement of the iPad 2, the original iPad was discontinued from sales online and at Apple authorized retail stores. Apple began selling the iPad 2 on its website on March 11, and in its U.S. retail stores at 5 pm local time on that date. Many stores in major cities, such as New York, sold out within hours. Online shipping delays had increased to three to four weeks on Sunday and four to five weeks by Tuesday. The iPad 2 was released internationally in 25 other countries on March 25, 2011. The countries included Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The April 29, 2011 release date for Japan was postponed due to the earthquake and tsunami which struck the nation on March 11, 2011. The iPads were delayed due to the NAND flash storage chip used in the iPads being created by Toshiba, which was affected by the earthquake and tsunami thus resulting in the suspension of operations for an indefinite period of time. The slowdown caused analysts to downgrade Apple's stock. The iPad 2 was later released in Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia and other countries including Japan on April 29, 2011. It was then released in numerous other nations which include China, Estonia, Thailand, Brazil, Russia and Taiwan on two major release dates, May 6 and 27. The 32 and 64GB models were discontinued on March 7, 2012, upon the introduction of the third generation iPad. The 16GB Wi-Fi and 16GB Wi-Fi + 3G models were discontinued on March 18, 2014. Features =Software= In late March 2011, the iPad 2 was released alongside iOS 4.3,https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/03/02Apple-Launches- iPad-2/https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/ipad-faq/differences-between- ipad-2-original-ipad.html which primarily introduced Airplay Mirroring and Home Sharing among other features. On October 12, 2011, upon the release of the iPhone 4S, the iPad was upgradable to the iOS 5 firmware update which brought over 200 new user features to iOS compatible devices including Notification Center, iMessage, Reminders, and an updated notifications system, using a new \\"banner\\" style instead of the previously used pop-up \\"alert\\" style. The iPad 2 comes with several applications by default, including Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, Music, iTunes (store), Maps, Notes, Calendar, Photo Booth, and Contacts. The App Store is also available as a default application, it enables users to download from a database of 800,000 applications,Indvik, Lauren. June 11, 2012. \\"App Store Stats: 400 Million Accounts, 650,000 Apps.\\" http://mashable.com/2012/06/11/wwdc-2012-app-store- stats/ the price of these applications is set by the developers. Like all iOS devices, the iPad 2 can sync music, videos, apps and photos with a Mac or PC using iTunes, although when using iOS 5 and later, the user does not have to connect the iPad to the computer. iCloud also allows users to backup and sync their data with other compatible iOS devices via the internet. Game Center is available as a native social gaming platform on iOS, games downloaded via the App Store that have this feature enabled are able to integrate their achievement points, high-scores and bonus system across all iOS devices into a single accumulative points and social platform. Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a cellular network, a user can use a wired headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi- Fi or cellular using a VoIP application. The iPad 2 also adds the ability to run GarageBand, iMovie, and the iWork apps Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. These applications do not come with the iPad but are instead official applications from Apple sold within the App Store. On March 7, 2012, after the unveiling of the third generation iPad, the firmware of the iPad 2 was upgradable to iOS 5.1. Scott Rohde, a senior Sony executive described the iPad as \\"a game console disguised as a device that can be appropriated in the business workplace.\\" On September 19, 2012, almost a week after the announcement of the iPhone 5, iOS 6 was released for numerous iOS devices, including the iPad 2 and iPhone 4S. However, on iOS 6, not all features are available on the iPad 2. The software upgrade was downloadable as an over the air (OTA) update package and contains two hundred new features, including a mapping software designed by Apple dubbed Apple Maps, a \\"Clock\\" app, which features a timer, stopwatch and alarm, and Facebook integration among other new features and tweaks. The iPad 2 is compatible with iOS 7, which was released on September 18, 2013. However, some features are not available. For example, like the iPhone 4, the Notification Center and the Control Center use the transparent style instead of the translucent style in later iOS models. Also, AirDrop, which was first released in iOS 7, was only supported by the iPad 4 or later. The iPad 2 can run iOS 8, which was released on September 17, 2014, making it the first iOS device to run five major versions of iOS (including iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). While the OS runs on the device, most of its new features do not work because of relatively aged hardware and therefore, its performance is limited. Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery-related issues. Many users speculated that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that the model was more than 3 years old. It was confirmed on June 8, 2015 at Apple's WWDC that the iPad 2 would run iOS 9, making it the first iOS device to run six major versions of iOS. As with previous releases, though, many headline features were unavailable on the iPad 2, including predictive Siri, translucency effects, split-view, slide-over and picture-in-picture multitasking and the Health app. iOS 9 is said to feature performance improvements that may help the aging device function more smoothly, and initial tests suggest that it did not significantly impact available space. Other A5-based devices will also run iOS 9 including the iPhone 4S (five major iOS versions), the iPad Mini (four major iOS versions) and iPod Touch 5G (four major iOS versions). On June 13, 2016, with the release of iOS 10, Apple dropped support for the iPad 2 because of its hardware and performance issues. The same goes with the its successor and iPad Mini (1st generation), making iOS 9.3.5 (Wi-Fi) or iOS 9.3.6 (Wi-Fi + Cellular) the final version that will run on the device. \\"Broadpwn\\" exploit vulnerability The iPad 2 is one of many computers and mobile devices susceptible to the \\"Broadpwn\\" exploit, which was publicized in July 2017. Apple quickly released an update for iOS 10 to fix the problem, but a fix was never released for iOS 9 or earlier versions of iOS. As a result, older Apple devices incompatible with iOS 10, including the iPad 2, were left vulnerable indefinitely. This has raised concerns of potentially widespread attacks using the exploit, particularly in locations of concentrated iPad 2 deployment, such as certain primary and secondary schools. 2019 GPS rollover update On July 22, 2019 Apple released iOS 9.3.6 for the CDMA model of the iPad 2 to fix issues caused by the GPS week number rollover. The issues would impact accuracy of GPS location and set the device's date and time to an incorrect value, preventing connection to HTTPS servers and, consequently, Apple's servers for activation, iCloud and the iTunes and App stores. The WiFi model and the GSM model are not affected by the rollover as the WiFi model lacks a GPS chipset and the GSM model uses a different chipset. =Hardware= Apple A5 chip used in the iPad 2 The iPad 2 features an Apple A5 package-on-package (PoP) System-on-chip (SoC), which comprises a 1 GHz dual-core 32-bit Cortex-A9 CPU, 512 MB of RAM and a dual- core PowerVR SGX543MP2 GPU. Other features include front and rear cameras, a three-axis gyroscope, headset controls, proximity and ambient light sensors, microphone, magnetometer, accelerometer and a 9.7 inch multi-touch screen with a maximum resolution of 1024√ó768 hence resulting in 132 ppi. The iPad 2 has four physical switches, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep, volume up/down, and a third switch for either screen rotation lock or mute. The home button on the iPad 2 is \\"easier to double tap\\" than the previous generation of the iPad. Apple reduced the size of the iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from the display, integrating new thinner glass technology for the touch screen overlay, and slightly reducing the space between the display and battery. The iPad 2's screen is thinner, lighter, and yet stronger than the original iPad's. The iPad 2 also supports screen mirroring via the digital AV adapter and through AirPlay as of iOS 5. The iPad 2 has a 25 W¬∑h rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery that lasts 10 hours, like the original iPad. It is charged via USB or included 10 W, 2 A power adapter. The battery is 2.5 mm thick, 59% smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two. The improvements allowed the injection-molded plastic support frame to be omitted. The 10 W USB power adapter provides 4x the power of a conventional USB port. The tablet has an audio frequency response of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Without third-party software it can play the following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+), ALAC, AIFF, and WAV. The revised tablet adds front- and rear-facing cameras, which allow FaceTime video calls with other iPad 2s, the third generation iPad, iPhone 4 and 4S, fourth-generation iPod Touch and Macintosh computers (running Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later with a webcam). The 0.3 MP front camera shoots VGA-quality 30 frame/s video and VGA- quality still photos. The 0.7 MP back camera can shoot 720p HD video at 30 frame/s and has a 5√ó times digital zoom. Both shoot photo in a 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio. The rear camera shoots video in 16:9 widescreen to match the 720p standard, although only the central 4:3 part of the recording is shown on the screen during recording. The forward-facing camera shoots in 4:3. The Apple A5 chip doubles processing speed and has graphics processing that is up to nine times faster than the previous iPad. However, benchtests and hardware assessments performed by various third party news sources and technology blogs indicate that those claims are exaggerated; the benchmark assessment conducted by Anandtech showed that the GPU of the iPad 2 is only 3 times faster than that of the original iPad. CPU benchmarks conducted on the iPad 2 by iOSnoops indicate a 66% performance increase compared to the original iPad. 3G versions of the iPad 2 offer CDMA2000 support for customers using the device on a CDMA network or GSM/UMTS support for customers using the device on a GSM/UMTS network. The iPad Wi-Fi + 3G model includes an A-GPS receiver for tracking the user's location given permission. Also, the iPad 2 3G model includes a plastic cap-like band at the top on the back for the 3G antenna. The metallic grille for the microphone is replaced with a matching plastic black grille on the 3G model. GSM models of iPad 2 use a SIM card while CDMA models use an ESN to connect to the cellular network. The device is 15% lighter and 33% thinner than the original iPad; it is thinner than the iPhone 4 by 0.5 mm. The Wi-Fi version is . Both the GSM and CDMA versions (known respectively as the AT&T; and Verizon versions in the US) differ in weight slightly due to the mass difference between the GSM and CDMA cellular radios, with the GSM model at and the CDMA model at . The size of the iPad 2 is also less than the original iPad at only 9.50√ó7.31√ó0.34 in (241.2√ó185.7√ó8.8 mm), compared to the original iPad's size at 9.56√ó7.47√ó0.5 in (242.8√ó189.7√ó13.4 mm). After the announcement and release of the third generation iPad, the iPad 2, which continued to be available for purchase, received a hardware upgrade. The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5 SoC, which is able to reduce battery consumption. Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by at least an hour and a half, depending on the task that is conducted on the device. The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance difference between the two variants, according to Anandtech is negligible. =Accessories= The Smart Cover, first introduced with the iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically attaches to the face of the iPad. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version. Apple offers several more accessories for the iPad 2, most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack. A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter (\\"wall charger\\") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad. Reception The iPad 2 received generally positive reviews, praising its Apple A5 processor and 720p camera. Joshua Topolsky of Engadget said that \\"for those of you who haven't yet made the leap, feel free to take a deep breath and dive in ‚Äì the iPad 2 is as good as it gets right now. And it's really quite good.\\" Jason Snell of Macworld said the following: > \\"Though the iPad 2 is an improvement on the original iPad in numerous ways, > it's still an evolutionary product, not a revolutionary one. If you're happy > with your current iPad, there's no reason to dump it just because there's a > shinier, newer one. (This is not to say that millions of people won't do > just that. I mean: shiny!) If you've invested in iPad accessories such as a > dock or case, keep in mind that you probably won't be able to use them with > the new iPad.\\" TechCrunch's MG Siegler stated: \\"Let me sum all of this up in a simple way: the iPad 2, should you buy one? Maybe ‚Äî it depends on a few factors. Will you want to buy one? Yes. Use that information wisely.\\" =Criticism= The closed and proprietary nature of iOS has garnered criticism, particularly by digital rights advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle, Internet-law specialist Jonathan Zittrain, and the Free Software Foundation who protested the iPad's introductory event and have targeted the iPad with their \\"Defective by Design\\" campaign. Competitor Microsoft, via a PR spokesman, has also criticized Apple's control over its platform. =Technical problems= At issue are restrictions imposed by the design of iOS, namely DRM intended to lock purchased media to Apple's platform, the development model (requiring a yearly subscription to distribute apps developed for the iOS), the centralized approval process for apps, as well as Apple's general control and lockdown of the platform itself. Particularly at issue is the ability for Apple to remotely disable or delete apps at will. Some in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked-down iOS represents a growing trend in Apple's approach to computing, particularly Apple's shift away from machines that hobbyists can \\"tinker with\\" and note the potential for such restrictions to stifle software innovation. Some iPad 2 users reported performance issues when running iOS 8. Apple improved performance on the iPad 2 and the iPhone 4S on the iOS 8.1.1 update. =Commercial reception= During the first weekend of sale, more than one million units were sold. Soon after the first weekend, Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst for a financial firm predicted that Apple would sell 35 million iPad 2s in 2011. Investment banking firm, Piper Jaffray monitored the initial sales of the iPad 2 and reported that 70% of all iPad 2 sales were to first-time iPad buyers with 49% of buyers owning a PC compared to the initial buyers of the original iPad where only 26% of buyers owned a PC. 12,000 units were sold on auction site eBay in its first two weeks of release. When the iPhone 4S was released, rumors about the third generation iPad caused a decline in iPad 2 sales. Official figures released in the fourth quarter of 2011 indicate that Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the third quarter, a 166% increase from the third quarter of 2010. The product helped create newer, larger markets for Apple in south east Asia. =In space= In 2011 two iPad 2 tablets were taken to the International Space Station after being approved. Other Apple products that were taken to ISS include the iPod and also two iPhone 4 phones. The other personal computing system aboard ISS were various versions of the ThinkPad laptop (IBM, later Lenovo brand). Some of the applications the iPads were used for include Angry Birds game and the ISS FIT (International Space Station Food Intake Tracker) for tracking astronauts food consumption.

The Carbondale Historical Society is a local historical society in Carbondale, Pennsylvania, United States. It operates a local history museum on the third floor of the Carbondale City Hall and Courthouse. History The first public meeting of the Historical Society, founded in October 1974 by a group of six Carbondale area school teachers, was held in January 1975. The Carbondale City Hall building had been in disrepair at this time, and was being considered for demolition and replacement. However, the intrinsic value of the building seemed too great to destroy, for a group of civic-minded individuals which comprised the Committee to Restore Carbondale City Hall. The Committee and the Society were effectively facing the same issues, and members of both organizations thought it best to consolidate into one entity. On November 6, 1982, the Historical Society and the Committee to Restore Carbondale City Hall merged to form the Carbondale Historical Society and Museum, which was incorporated on March 15, 1983. The Carbondale Historical Society and Museum is an educational and historical membership organization whose mission is to record, gather, and preserve the history of the city of Carbondale and the surrounding area. Today Through its genealogical and local history research center and exhibition galleries on the third floor of Carbondale City hall (listed in the National Register of Historic Places on January 6, 1983, through the efforts of the Society) and through an annual series of public lectures, programs, exhibitions, and commemorative ceremonies, in the community and in the public schools, the Society, at the same time, interprets and makes accessible to the public Carbondale's history and heritage. Museum Among the most important accomplishments of the Historical Society was the establishment of a professionally organized and managed museum of local history and genealogy. The museum's collections are especially rich in two areas: anthracite coal mining and railroad history, especially that of the Delaware and Hudson railroad. So extensive have the railroad holdings of the Society become, that a specific section of its holdings has been designated as a Delaware and Hudson transportation museum. Given the broad range of artifacts that relate to local history, from the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the Society has established, a Victorian parlour as the context for the exhibition of many of its holdings. Research materials and archives There is an extensive collection of local birth and death records, cemetery records, and church records. All of the newspapers in the holdings of the Society, from the 1820s to the present, have been microfilmed. These microfilms are available for research purposes at the Carbondale Public Library. Local History Awards Begun in the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, the Society's Local History Awards program has encouraged high school juniors and seniors in area schools to study and participate in the recording of history.Local History Awards , Carbondale Historical Society. In its first and second years, the program was instituted only in the Carbondale Area Junior/Senior High School, but future years may see its spread to other schools.

It was also worn as a sign of royalty and became symbolized in later ages as a metallic ring which was a stylized band of cloth. Later, in medieval times, a fillet was a type of headband worn by unmarried women, in certain monk hoods, usually with a wimple or barbette.

History St. Luke's was founded as a Dutch Reformed congregation in 1850, first meeting in rented rooms on the third floor of a building on 35th Street and 9th Avenue. It reorganized as a Lutheran congregation in 1853. The church moved several times, acquiring its first owned building, a former Baptist church on 43rd Street, in 1863. It moved in 1875 to 233 West 42nd Street, into the former Forty-second Street Presbyterian Church. Finally, the congregation acquired property at West 46th Street to build its current church. The cornerstone was laid in October 1922 and the church dedicated in September 1923. For many years, Dr. Donald Grey Barnhouse, pastor of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia and teacher on the radio program, The Bible Study Hour (now known as Dr. Barnhouse & the Bible), held a Bible class on Monday evenings at the church, which lasted until his death in 1960. An independent congregation without synodic affiliation since 1880, St. Luke's joined the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1987. St. Luke's Theatre is located on the church's premises. Architecture The church was built in 1922‚Äì23 to the designs of Edward L. Tilton of Tilton & Githens, with the facade of the nave featuring windows designed by Francis Xavier Zettler. The building was completed in 1923. The architecture has been described as a happy marriage between the Gothic Revival and Art Deco styles. A four-story parish house at 308‚Äì316 West 46th Street was built 1922 to designs by architect Francis Keally of 141 East 45th Street at the cost of $150,000.

Mostly known for his prep and college career, he spent two seasons with the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL), but knee injuries in successive years during the pre-season kept him off the field. Biography Smith was an All-American running back at Lake Howell High School in Winter Park, Florida. In 1990, he was named High School Football Player of the Year by Gatorade, and Offensive Player of the Year by USA Today. Considered to be the premier recruit in the class of 1991, Smith chose Florida State over Penn State and Florida. He could not live up to expectations, and decided to transfer to Central Florida (UCF) after his redshirt sophomore season in 1994. In only two seasons at UCF, Smith rushed for 2,569 yards; through the 2018 season, he is fourth on UCF's list of career rushing yardage leaders, and the only player in the top ten with less than a three-season career at UCF. He is the only player in UCF history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, and his 1,511 yards (with 14 touchdowns) in 1995 set the school's single-season record (later surpassed by Kevin Smith in 2007). Smith earned second team All-America honors in 1995, and was an honorable mention selection on UCF's 25th Anniversary Football Team as compiled by the Orlando Sentinel.

The poem is mentioned in two books of the 13th century Prose Edda book‚ÄîGylfaginning and Sk√°ldskaparm√°l‚Äîbut outside of a single, two-lined fragment that appears in Gylfaginning, the poem is considered to be lost. In the surviving fragment, Heimdallr comments that he is the son of nine sisters (the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr). Scholars have commented on the information the surviving lines presents and have speculated about what the poem may have contained. Fragment The poem is mentioned in two books of the Prose Edda; Gylfaginning and Sk√°ldskaparm√°l. The sole surviving fragment of Heimdalargaldr appears in chapter 25 of Gylfaginning. In the chapter, the enthroned figure of High tells the disguised mythical king Gangleri about the god Heimdallr, including that he is the son of nine sisters. After quoting a stanza about the Heimdallr's dwelling Himinbj√∂rg from the poem Gr√≠mnism√°l, High comments that Heimdallr says the following lines in a work by the name of Heimdalargaldr: > {  Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur's translation: :I am of nine mothers the > offspring, :Of sisters nine am I the son.Brodeur (1916:40).

The section notes that Heimdallr is the subject of a work known as Heimdalargaldr, and that, since the poem, \\"the head has been called Heimdall's doom: man's doom is an expression for sword.\\"Faulkes (1995:76). Commentary Scholar John Lindow comments that Heimdalargaldr must have provided information about the deeds and feats of Heimdallr, and that having the poem preserved would have helped with the difficulties that what survives about it presents, such as Heimdallr's birth by way of nine sisters and why a head would be known as \\"Heimdallr's sword\\".Lindow (1998:168).

Anti-Ottoman risings Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Da'ud was a great-nephew of the imam al-Hadi Izz ad-Din (d. 1495) who had revived the fortunes of the Zaidi state in the late 15th century. The troops of the Ottoman sultan Selim II, led by Sinan Pasha crushed Yemeni resistance in 1570. However, discontent with the occupiers continued, especially in the highlands where people belonged to the Zaydiyyah in opposition to the Sunni lowlands. In 1579 al-Hasan proclaimed the imamate in the Ahnum region under the name an-Nasir al-Hasan, vowing to fight the Turks.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p, 996. His rising was paralleled by a messianic movement, led by a certain Mansur Himyar in the Anis region, which proclaimed the end of the Ottoman Empire. Defeated by Hasan Pasha However, the power basis of an-Nasir al-Hasan was quite limited. He was actually attacked by other Zaidi groups, such as the Hamzah sharifs, the sons of the last imam al- Mutahhar, and even by his cousins of the Mu'ayyad clan. In 1580, a new and redoubtable Ottoman governor, Hasan Pasha, was appointed by the Porte. By making use of the inner divisions of the highland groups, Hasan Pasha was able to reinforce the sultan's authority in the regions north of San'a. Sa'dah and Najran were occupied by the Turks in 1583.Michel Tuchscherer, 'Chronologie du Y√©men (1506-1635)', Chroniques y√©menites 8 2000, http://cy.revues.org/11 . An- Nasir al-Hasan kept his stronghold in the inaccessible Shaharah but was eventually betrayed and captured on 11 September 1585. His captor was the ketkhuda (deputy) of Hasan Pasha, Emir Sinan.Robert W. Stookey, Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic. Boulder 1978, p. 141. His date of capture is also given as 1596/97, which appears to be incorrect. After having spent one year in prison in San'a, he was brought to Turkey where he eventually died in 1615. The torch of resistance was taken over in 1597 by the imam al-Mansur al-Qasim, of another Sayyid lineage, who founded a new Yemeni state.

The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Orient included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scheina, p 72Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History left After delivery in 1961, Point Orient was assigned a homeport of Fort Pierce, Florida, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. On 15 January 1965, she towed the disabled MV Sally southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, to safety. At the request of the United States Navy, in April 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 16 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 13Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Orient was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines in May 1965 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single- sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four M2 machine guns. The original bow-mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 Point Orient was assigned to Division 12 of Squadron One to be based at Da Nang, along with , , , , and .

Permanent engineering and logistic support of Division 12 was provided by a U.S. Navy non-self-propelled floating workshop, YR-71. Point Orient became the first Coast Guard unit in Vietnam to engage the enemy on 24 July 1965 after being fired on from the shore by machine guns and mortars while attempting to board a junk.

It is the episcopal see of the Archbishop of Cartagena de Indias, one of the oldest episcopal sees in the Americas. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The cathedral was designed by master builder Sim√≥n Gonz√°lez, modelled after basilicas in Andalusia and the Canary Islands. The present tower was designed by French architect Gast√≥n Lelarge, the result of remodelling in the early twentieth century. Construction began in 1577, replacing a humble cathedral of straw and reeds. In 1586, while the church was still under construction, it was attacked by the English privateer Francis Drake, which caused severe damage and delayed its completion. The building was finished in 1612. The cathedral has a fine doorway and a simply decorated interior. It contains an 18th-century gilded altar, a Carrara marble pulpit and elegant arcades sustaining the central nave.South American Handbook 2009 p.944 In the first half of the 20th century it underwent a drastic remodeling by the French architect Gaston Lelarge.  History  The current cathedral concerns the third building built as a cathedral church in the city. The first one was promoted by the Dominican friar Tom√°s de Toro y Cabrero, first bishop of Cartagena, and who was named by the Pope Paul III. The construction of the temple began in 1535, only two years after the founding of the city, and ended in 1537. It was a humble construction of \\"thatched roof and reeds\\", was located in the block that is behind the present cathedral, with front on the street calle del Coliseo. The life of this building was short, for in 1552 a fire consumed much of the city and in ruins the cathedral was converted. In its replacement, between 1563 and 1568, the construction of the second cathedral temple was carried out, realized in wood and of thatched ceiling, because were difficult times and it did not have many resources, but was more solid than the previous one. From this second temple a modest trace is preserved in the General Archive of the Indies and a physical remnant of its bulrush. Pedro Fern√°ndez de Busto, governor of the city, notably the promoter of the architectural works that were carried out at that time and who also undertook the task of carrying out important projects in the urban area, such as the drying and sanitation of the main entrance of the city, which established the Plaza Real (now the Plaza de la Aduana); the initiation of the works of an aqueduct, which was never completed and would endow the city with running water; The construction of a hospital, and the creation of houses for the administration of justice, the jail and the Cabildo. The idea of granting Cartagena a dignified building that would serve as a cathedral church emerges and is also promoted by himself. In addition, towards 1575 the Dominican friar Dionisio de los Santos arrived like new bishop, who sends a letter to the King, dated May 25 of that year, where he describes something about the cult in the cathedral, among which he says: \\"There are no rations or half rations, no choirboys, but a clever sacristan and two sacristan waiters who serve the altar in a T-shirt and zarag√ºelles, which there is no more. And so this church is served as a sad parish of Spain, \\"so the sovereign gives immediate order to rebuild it. In that same year (1575) a public contest was called to select the design of the building, which was presented by the masters Eugenio de la Vega, Hernando Esteban, Juanes Guerra and Sim√≥n Gonz√°lez The project presented by the latter, was chosen as a \\"major workman\\" of the work, a practically supervisory position, with a salary of $50,000 maraved√≠s per year, also indicating a daily of Twenty-two reales for each day he worked in the construction, allowing him to simultaneously exercise that position with the other activities of his office. In turn, Hernando Esteban was commissioned by the Cabildo as immediate director of the traces and Juanes Guerra worked on the project and occupied a prominent position. The stonemason Mart√≠n de Marquina was in charge of supplying the stone, and also worked as officers in the work the stonemasons Pedro de Aguilar, Francisco Ruiz, Juan de Medina and Gaspar Juanes. The plan of the main chapel, it can see the esquifate vault that covers this chapel, it can also see the kind of crypt under the presbytery, destined to serve like tomb to the priests of the city. Thus began the construction of the third Cathedral by the year 1575, located far from the port for security reasons, in a corner that faces a narrow street later named \\"Santos de Piedra\\", next to the present park Parque de Bol√≠var; But without facing it, following the model adopted by Nicol√°s de Ovando in Santo Domingo and the old and strong tradition of the church surrounded, in time, by the most outstanding constructions of the city, as they are the headquarters of the civil power and the houses of the most important personages. In 1577, when the foundation was still being worked on, it was discussed in the Cabildo the feasibility of changing its orientation and turning its axis ninety degrees, as proposed by regidor and captain Sebasti√°n P√©rez. The councilors were in agreement with the proposal, they noticed that it would be better, but for that it was necessary to acquire properties and the Cabildo did not have extra funds to buy them. So, Captain P√©rez offered to donate 200 pesos for this purpose, but that amount was not enough, so the governor met with the neighbors (among whom a contribution from each other had been made to finance the work), and as everyone voted to continue the work as it was initiated, the cabildo decided for this, in addition the Governor indicated that it was not possible to make a new contribution from each other to acquire the houses, since the king only authorized it to do it only to pay the work. It is thus that the idea of turning the project was discarded and the work continued as it was planned. The work continued actively, because, a year later, \\"five arches to be made in the chapel are already to begin on the pillars that are made\\". Master Gonz√°lez, seeing the little strength and firmness of the stone, decided to add another support for the ceiling and modified in full gear the original design that was of six pairs of columns, which remained of seven pairs. During the course of the work some doubts were generated about the material of the arches and the height of the main nave in relation to the main chapel, but it was always heard and respected the point of view of the author of the design: The arches are built in stone, and the main nave of the same height as the main chapel. In 1579, more than half of the walls were at the level of the mark and the remaining part was at a height of five walls. In that same year it is named like new bishop Friar Juan de Montalvo. Already for 1585, ten years after the work began, it is stated that the volume of the building was covered and, although the neighboring buildings and tower were missing, the work was practically finished. = Drake attack = Map of the Drake fleet in Cartagena Nevertheless, the following year (1586), the English pirate, Francis Drake, ‚ÄúEl Draque‚Äù, appears before the coasts of Cartagena with a fleet of up to 23 ships of war and more than 3,000 men, and attacked the city, in which it was the most important military action carried out in the 16th century against the ports of America. Cartagena was taken and Drake was devoted to looting: It reduced to ashes a little more than half of the city and, before the refusal of its inhabitants to pay the juicy ransom that demanded, threatened to demolish to cannonades the cathedral, that at that moment had to be the most precious good of the city. Then he made the first warning shot, which was enough to seriously affect its structure, as the bullet struck one of the columns, knocking it down and taking two more. Arches that supported the three columns and part of the ceiling. Finally, the Cartagenians paid 110,000 silver ducats and Drake agreed not to continue the destruction of the city, after having it in its possession for 6 weeks. Central nave. Fortuitously and coincidentally, on the way to Quito, the master Benito de Morales passed through the city, who, at the request of the governor, examined the cathedral and evaluated the damage suffered. In this way he verified the good foundation of the walls and columns, gave indications for the reconstruction and recommended that the building be completed in such a way that the original project was not changed. Thus, slowly because of the lack of money that the British took and that was destined to the project, the repair works and completion of the temple began. In addition, after the attack and looting of the city, Bishop Friar Juan de Montalvo died the September 10 of 1586, of moral penalty after the demolition of his cathedral. The works of repair and termination passed very slowly. In 1591, the bishop Friar Antonio de Herv√≠as writes a letter to the king, in which it said: The letter of Bishop Friar Antonio de Herv√≠as addressed to the king is transcribed with the writing of that time, in addition some words have the spelling of that moment. Notwithstanding the pessimism of the bishop (reflecting the frequent enmity between the military and ecclesiastical authorities of the colony), reconstruction was undertaken, albeit slowly; in spite of the good desire of the governor, had not advanced much, since no funds were available since the city was very bad economically after the attack of the Drake.

The north side of the peninsula is a cove that was found be an adequate harbor for the young colony, and North Cove Road was laid out from the palisaded fort at the tip of the peninsula to the mainland. Early buildings along North Cove Road have not survived; the oldest surviving building is the Robert Bull House, built about 1700 near the western end of the road. The waterfront area remained commercially viable until 1870, when a railroad was built across the mouth of the cove. After this time, the houses in the area were for the most part adapted as summer residences. and The district is , extending along North Cove Road east of Church Street.

One of its basic premises is that the conceptualization of any specialized domain is goal- oriented, and depends to a certain degree on the task to be accomplished. Since a major problem in modeling any domain is the fact that languages can reflect different conceptualizations and construals, texts as well as specialized knowledge resources are used to extract a set of domain concepts. Language structure is also analyzed to obtain an inventory of conceptual relations to structure these concepts. As its name implies, frame-based terminology uses certain aspects of frame semantics to structure specialized domains and create non-language-specific representations. Such configurations are the conceptual meaning underlying specialized texts in different languages, and thus facilitate specialized knowledge acquisition. Frame-based terminology focuses on: # conceptual organization; # the multidimensional nature of terminological units; and # the extraction of semantic and syntactic information through the use of multilingual corpora. In frame-based terminology, conceptual networks are based on an underlying domain event, which generates templates for the actions and processes that take place in the specialized field as well as the entities that participate in them. As a result, knowledge extraction is largely text-based. The terminological entries are composed of information from specialized texts as well as specialized language resources. Knowledge is configured and represented in a dynamic conceptual network that is capable of adapting to new contexts. At the most general level, generic roles of agent, patient, result, and instrument are activated by basic predicate meanings such as make, do, affect, use, become, etc. which structure the basic meanings in specialized texts. From a linguistic perspective, Aktionsart distinctions in texts are based on Van Valin's classification of predicate types. At the more specific levels of the network, the qualia structure of the generative lexicon is used as a basis for the systematic classification and relation of nominal entities. The methodology of frame-based terminology derives the conceptual system of the domain by means of an integrated top-down and bottom-up approach. The bottom- up approach consists of extracting information from a corpus of texts in various languages, specifically related to the domain. The top-down approach includes the information provided by specialized dictionaries and other reference material, complemented by the help of experts in the field. In a parallel way, the underlying conceptual framework of a knowledge-domain event is specified. The most generic or base-level categories of a domain are configured in a prototypical domain event or action-environment interface. This provides a template applicable to all levels of information structuring. In this way a structure is obtained which facilitates and enhances knowledge acquisition since the information in term entries is internally as well as externally coherent.

They are part of the religious scriptures of Islam, although now they are believed to have been corrupted or lost. These scriptures are understood by Muslims to refer not to the Torah, the main Book of Law which Moses was given, but to an ancient text, which contained some of the inspired revelations which Moses received over his years of prophecy, which were then written down by Moses himself as well as his followers. Background In two Chapters, which are dated from the first Meccan period, there is a reference to the 'Leaves, Scrolls, Journals' (Suhuf) of Abraham (and of Moses), by which certain divinely inspired texts handwritten by the patriarchs are meant. These passages refer to the fact that the truth of God's message was present in the earliest revelations, Given to Abraham and Moses. Although Suhuf is generally understood to mean 'Scrolls', many translators - including Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Marmaduke Pickthall - have translated the verse as \\"The Books of Abraham and Moses\\".Marmaduke Pickthall, The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'an; Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary Qur'anic mention Moses, being a righteous prophet of God, received many revelations over his lifetime - the contents of which could be contained in this Book of Moses. Identification Many scholars have speculated whether the \\"Books of Moses\\" refer to the Torah or other scriptures of Moses. But the Islamic belief that the Torah was, in its original form, a single scripture of Law, the plural emphasis on Books and not Book leads many to believe that these Books are different. Qur'anic commentator Abdullah Yusuf Ali mentions that it could be a possible reference to a lost book of the Israelites, suggesting the Book of the Wars of the Lord, an apocryphal book referred to in the Bible, in Numbers 21:14. However, it is well known that the Jews usually refer to the Torah as The Five Books of Moses. Most Notably, Deuteronomy, the fifth book, is distinct in many ways, and is referred to as 'Mishneh Torah'-a review of the Torah. There's also an ancient guideline requiring religious scribes to leave four blank lines between each of the books. This custom (recorded in Babylonian Talmud, bava batra pg.13) predated Muhammad by hundreds of years. For this reason it is plausible to assume that Muhammad is referring to the five scrolls of Moses as they were known.

These eukaryotes are mostly green in colour, and have a single flagellum that extends the length of their body. They are morphologically very flat, rigid, leaf-shaped, and contain many small discoid chloroplasts. Phacus are commonly found in freshwater habitats around the globe and include several hundred species that continue to be discovered to this day. Currently, there are 564 species of Phacus in the database, but only 171 have been accepted taxonomically. The genus was established in 1841 and since then major discoveries have led it to become an extremely large group containing hundreds of species with varied physiological characteristics. Contemporary studies agree that Phacus is not monophyletic or holophyletic, but is actually polyphyletic. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus are currently poorly understood.  Etymology  The genus name is believed to have originated from the Greek word Phakos, meaning lentil or lens. This may be due to the general round or oval shape of the many species that are part of this genus. Its origins date back to the nineteenth century, in France, where it first received publication and establishment by Dujardin. The genus name is currently treated in literature as masculine.  History of Knowledge  The genus was first established by the French biologist Felix Dujardin in 1841. Dujardin first published collective findings of the genus in the scientific journal Histoire naturelle des Zoophytes, Infusoires in 1841, separating them from the genus Euglena. The reason behind the separation was in order to create a group that correctly organizes their established morphological characteristics such as their rigid, flat, leaf-shape and small discoid chloroplasts with absent pyrenoids. Christian Ehrenberg was one of the first scientists to discover and classify members of the genus; his discovery of Phacus longicauda (Ehrenberg) was one of the first species of the genus to be discovered (1830) and was used as the holotype species when describing the genus. Ehrenberg, Hubner, Dujardin, and Klebs were some of the earliest researchers of Phacus, but they all had different diagnostic criteria when classifying these organisms. Originally, Ehrenberg tried to classify three species he discovered as Euglena because of their color, but ultimately were moved to the genus Phacus by Dujardin due to the similarity they exhibited in other more prominent morphological characteristics such as shape and strip arrangement. Since the establishment of the genus, there has been difficulty in classifying organisms due to morphology because many species of Phacus have physiological traits that closely resemble other related genera. Even the most minor difference in certain physiological properties caused great confusion in determining the proper classification for many species. This occurred more prominently during the time of Dujardin because the methodology and technology used at the time in studying these organisms were far more simplistic compared to today, leading to greater difficulty in determining critical differences between organisms. Since its inception, Phacus has undergone constant reclassification and considerable re-evaluation of different taxa in accordance with new morphological and molecular information.  Habitat and Ecology  Phacus are commonly found in freshwater habitats all over the world. Many species of this genus have been discovered in several countries, including Japan, the United States, Portugal, Brazil, Korea and the Philippines. Different members of the genus have been found in temperatures ranging from 11.4-21.6 ¬∞C, and a pH between 6.2 and 7.5. Phacus organisms are found in a range of freshwater environments (some more acidic or alkaline than others), prefer cooler temperatures, and on average exist in more neutral pH aquatic habitats. Many species of Phacus are considered to be euplanktonic (free-floating organisms or open water plankton) because they are commonly found together with other genera of Euglenophyta. These species include members of the genera Lepocinclis, Trachelomonas, Euglena, and many different kinds of algae, which are typically found in similar aquatic habitats. The planktonic environments Phacus are generally found include swamps, ditches, trenches, ponds and even in many rice fields throughout North America and around the world. They are a small part of phytoplankton communities, but do serve important purposes such as nutrient cycling and food web stability. Their keen ability to colonize in huge numbers makes them able to survive and thrive in areas where certain algae cannot. However, Phacus are not common inhabitants of stagnant environments because those areas often do not have proper organic composition. = Feeding = Phacus are photosynthetic unicellular organisms, meaning that they are capable of producing their own food. Although the genus primarily receives their nutrients through photosynthesis, they are also capable of feeding on certain kinds of alga and bacteria using a feeding apparatus located on their underside. Many species of Phacus are known to be prey for a variety of marine and freshwater genera. The best known predators of the genus are planktonic Crustaceans, such as species of Diaptomus, Tropocyclops, Epischura, Daphnia, Daphnia, Diaphanosoma, and Holopedium. = Ecology = Being in an organically enriched freshwater environment is essential for the development of these species. Different studies have shown that the addition or removal of certain organic elements can have profound effects on cell development. In studies using beef extract to increase organic content of certain cultures, some species of Phacus were observed to have clear morphological changes different from the controls. These changes include: increasing thickness of the cell, increase in paramylon bodies (both in size and number in Phacus curvicauda), and the overall structure of the cells. Regardless of a large or small change in organic enrichment, studies show a consistency to these morphological changes. However, the amount of change that occurs varies between species and is dependent on the specific organic nutrients present. If the amount of organic nutrients in the genus‚Äô habitat is insufficient, occasionally they form resting cysts. If this occurs, the cells would expand (swell) and become more rounded, and also lose their flagella. This increase in size forces the cell to increase the number of paramylon storage granules and develop a polysaccharide mucilaginous wall for protection until it enters a more habitable environment. In addition, cell division continues to take place even as a reproductive cyst.  Description of the Genus  = Morphology = Phacus consists of organisms that are microscopic photosynthetic Euglenoids, which are a group of single celled, chloroplast- containing autotrophs within the phylum Euglenozoa, though the majority of genera within the phylum actually do not contain chloroplasts and are colourless. Generally these species are small, free swimming and exhibit a vibrant green colour. What sets the genus apart from other photosynthetic species is the presence of its rigid cytoskeleton (although some species have semi-rigid or plastic cytoskeleton) made up of pellicular strips and its predominantly flat, leaf-shaped structure. Many different species express secondary fusion of these pellicular strips and many of the strips have a variety of shapes including S-shaped, A-shaped, M-shaped or plateau. The pellicles forms a shell around the cytoskeleton covering the whole cell and fuses together around the microtubule reinforced-pocket (MTR). This pocket acts as a sort of cytostome or ingestion organelle, allowing the organism to feed when bacteria enter inside. The microtubules are arranged in a peculiar doublet and triplet pattern in the upper canal. In certain species of Phacus, the MTR is a microtubule organizing center and is connected to a reservoir membrane by a striated fiber. Many species also possess an elongated caudal process with extended pellicle strips. Throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, chloroplasts are spread out fairly evenly and in high numbers. They are typically discoid and are regularly disposed of and replaced. Chloroplasts that are present in large numbers are typically smaller, are without pyrenoids and species containing fewer chloroplasts tend to have much larger ones. Phacus, like all photosynthetic Euglenoids, obtained their plastids through secondary endosymbiosis, where the ancestral phagocytic Euglenoid engulfed a green alga, and the resulting organism became the plastid. Most of these organisms also possess a semi-rectangular eyespot, often reddish in color, and a single flagellum, although some species have two, which emerges anteriorly. The flagellum is responsible for cell movement by gyrating in the direction of travel allowing the cell to glide and swim in the water. Furthermore, some flagella vary in length from short all the way to the length of the cell in other species. Although many members of the genus have two flagella, only one is ever used for movement. The other one is usually too short and does not exit the invagination of the posterior area known as the flagellar pocket. They are located within a posterior structure called the flagellar apparatus, also known as the basal body complex. Aside from the flagella, the flagellar apparatus also contains two basal bodies connected by a striated fiber, three asymmetric microtubular roots, and other connective fibers. The genus only has one large anisotropic body unlike many other Euglenid genera, which commonly have two. This anisotropic body is referred to as paramylon and functions as a storage substance. The paramylon is a carbohydrate energy store reserve and it is quite different from other algal carbohydrate stores due to the high amounts of crystallization present. The nucleus of the cell is generally positioned towards the middle of the cell and is adjacent to the paramylon reserve. Within the nucleus are permanently condensed chromosomes, which can easily be viewed under a light microscope. Just like other Euglenids, several species of Phacus also possess many contractile vacuoles and have a red- pigmented eyespot. = Differences in Morphology = Although the general morphology of the genus is considered to be well established, given the large number of species there are critical morphological differences observed worth noting. The sulcus for example, in many species is shallow (Phacus viridioryza), and in others it is deep and longitudinal (Phacus hordeiformis). As well, the shape of the cell in some species are completely flat, while many have also been described as helically twisted, straight or curved. Phacus helikoides is actually helical in shape throughout the entire cell as opposed to flat and leaf-shaped like most Phacus organisms. Metaboly, which is the ability of some organisms to alter their shape, is not possible in Phacus due to the fusion of the genus‚Äô pellicular strips. These varied morphological shapes make defining the genus as symmetrical or asymmetrical rather difficult. Scientists who study the genus Phacus Dujardin, have also observed the presence of ellipsoid, tiny disk-shaped or flat-shaped paramylon grains. In some species of Phacus, a single plate dominates the interiors of the cell (Phacus Orbicularis), and in others there are multiple plates with different morphologies that exist (Phacus Curvicauda). Other differences among species include: the presence or lack of haplopyrenoids within the chloroplasts, position of the nucleus, a large or small endosome, shape of the cytoskeleton, few to several paramylon discoid grains, the presence of lateral caps and presence of oblique truncated poles. In addition, the morphology of the caudal process in many species of Phacus is extremely varied. Phacus parvullis and Phacus pusillus have very a blunt caudal process while Phacus segretti and Phacus stokesii actually lack a caudal process entirely. Those species are described as having rounded posteriors in place of the caudal process. Studies show that morphological changes observed in the genus are possibly due to the level of organic enrichment in their freshwater habitats. These morphological differences, given the massive size of the genus, have led to certain confusion in Phacus taxonomy. = Life Cycle = Phacus and other Euglenids typically reproduce asexually. They do so by dividing their cells longitudinally, from the apex of the cell to the base. Until cytokinesis is fully complete, the cells remain attached to one another, forming what looks like a ‚Äútwo-headed‚Äù organism. Prior to cytokinesis, the amount of pellicle strips each cell has is doubled in order to have an equal number between each daughter cell. In addition, each daughter cell will contain half the number of the newly formed strips and half the number of the old strips present prior to cell division. = Phylogeny = Phacus is a member of the family Euglenaceae, the order Euglenales, class Euglenoidea, and finally the phylum Euglenozoa. Certain ancestral information regarding Phacus has been debated. Many studies looked at the genes of its many species by examining small subunit rRNA (SSU) sequences and arranging certain species into clades. What those scientists were trying to determine is what the phylogenetic tree of Phacus looks like based on molecular factors. Certain molecular phylogenetic analyses have described Phacus as being monophyletic depending on the clade studied, but the general consensus through multiple repeated analyses is that the genus is polyphyletic. This possible discrepancy has caused certain scientists to suggest possibly redefining this genus as two separate genera. In accordance with that, it is believed that Phacus divided early on in the history of photosynthetic Euglenids. = Genetics = A major genetic change in the genus occurred in its chloroplast genome throughout its evolution. This resulted in a genome reduction - possibly due to gene loss or transfer to the nucleus, an increase in the number of introns, and large genomic rearrangements. = Evolution = The literature mentioned above have also looked into the evolutionary history of the genus‚Äô morphology. It is believed that the rigidity of the cells has evolved numerous times, and that was determined by comparing the semi-rigid pellicles of ancestral species with the rigid pellicles of their descendants. Another feature believed to have evolved, are the longitudinal strips that appear on most species. It appears that the number of those strips has either increased or decreased over time depending on certain species and that their arrangement (either helical or longitudinal) has also changed throughout evolution. Furthermore, it has been argued that certain behavioral and locomotor traits which previously existed for predatory feeding have no longer been selected. This seemed to have had an effect on the number of strips species of Phacus generally have. The changing numbers of strips and the clustered patterns associated are not actually adaptive themselves, but may have evolved due to the cell becoming more flat and more rigid over time. Those traits are believed to have evolved in order to adapt to a more planktonic lifestyle.  Fossil History  The fossil record for Phacus, like most Euglenophyta, is very scarce, and little information is actually known of their geographical origins. However, there have been reports that Phacus-like microfossils have been discovered from pyriform cells, which seem to closely resemble that of Phacus or another closely related genus, Lepocinclis. These fossils, although not certain to belong to the genus, are estimated to be over 60 million years old.  Practical Importance  The presence of Phacus in certain bodies of water can actually indicate the level of organic pollution of the water. It has been observed that if a large number of Phacus organisms are present, that is indicative of high organic pollution. This particular trait allows scientists to determine the health of different bodies of water.  References  Further reading  Phacus. (n.d.).

Sometimes internal devaluation is considered as alternative to 'standard' external devaluation when nominal exchange rates are fixed, although social implications and speed of economic recovery can significantly differ between the two options. While proponents usually blame fiscal profligacy or loss of competitiveness as the reason for a need to devalue internally, critics oftentimes view macroeconomic imbalances and the absence of a fiscal transfer mechanism within a currency union as culprits. Internal devaluation was first considered during the Sweden economic crisis during the 1990s and Finland's accession to the European Union in 1995. Internal devaluation gained popularity during the economic recession of 2008‚Äì2010 when several countries pursued such policies with aim to restore competitiveness and to balance national budgets. Latvia is often named as successful case of internal devaluation by popular media, although its poor performance in the international development indices (e.g. Global competitiveness indices, European Union Innovation Scoreboard, the miserable rating levels had not changed in the following year as well ) as well as severe emigration have been claimed to prove the negative impact of internal devaluation on the development of the human resources and potential GDP (whose performance can be measured by the notable inflation rate). Academic research While internal devaluation has been discussed in newspapers and has been put into work as a policy already for some years in the several countries, peer-reviewed research on the topic is sparse and has started to appear only recently. Much of it is restricted to qualitative observations (e.g. ScienceDirect database list more than 3 times more articles for such emerging discipline as geo-engineering (human control of global climate) than for internal devaluation). merely mentions some well known news items about the internal devaluation. recognizes that \\"the most efficient way to reduce the cost of labour is to run high levels of unemployment\\". But apparently, that can be acceptable only in the countries where the gray economy is tolerated. In fact, there is research about the labour market policies that has been implemented during the internal devaluation and the researcher concluded \\"I will argue that the seemingly flexible reaction of the ... labour market to the crisis is to a large extent due to weak law enforcement\\". acknowledges (without quantitative estimations) that the policy of internal devaluation is \\"painful and slow\\". Currently is the most exhaustive manuscript about internal devaluation. It acknowledges that the internal devaluation can be politically costly and that it requires that the \\"labour market institutions need to allow for more flexibility, and more product market competition is required\\", but it misses the point that the development of the human capital cannot occur without the necessary investments. It also mentions the limitations of what can be achieved by the internal devaluation‚Äîinternal devaluation can result in the \\"interesting trap of no-downward wage adjustment as the flexible part of earnings vanishes\\". The article also proposes idea about internal revaluation. Paul de Grauwe argues that the competitiveness of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain deteriorated during the period from 1999 to 2008/9, and that since 2008/9 dramatic turnarounds of the competitive positions have occurred in Ireland, Spain and Greece. de Grauwe estimates Ireland to have completed an internal devaluation amounting to 23.5%, Greece 11.4%, Spain 8.9%, Portugal 3.2% and Italy 0.6%.In search of symmetry in the eurozone, Paul de Grauwe, 2 May 2012 Pisani-Ferry argues that internal devaluation would optimally entail a simultaneous cut of, say, 10% to all wages and prices in a country. While this is difficult to achieve in practice, he says internal devaluation is not impossible to implement in a meaningful way. Pisani-Ferry says Latvia was rather successful in performing its internal devaluation following the crisis of 2008‚Äì09. While the process was painful in terms of unemployment and wage cuts, exports did pick up, the external deficit was eliminated and Latvia's economy returned to growth.Jean Pisani-Ferry: \\"The Euro Crisis and its Aftermath\\", loc 2089 Another alternative (mentioned in old textbooks) is to cut taxes, hence making labour cost cheaper http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/2495/economics/internal-devaluation- definition/ Criticism Given the lack of solid empirical studies on the topic, the success of internal devaluation has been considered as an urban legend or even political propaganda by some. According to critics, the eventual success of internal devaluation is based on several myths. Some of them arise from the poor knowledge of the economics by the general population and some are introduced by the politicians and the think tanks that support them. * Myth 1: It is necessary to create harsh conditions for employees and unemployed to increase the productivity of the workforce. Critics say this can only happen in select cases where companies do not have the necessary controls in the place for measuring and rewarding the results of the workforce. Such select cases are seen to arise in economies where government policies provide companies with a cheap workforce and the companies are not motivated to invest into the optimization of their processes - the companies can achieve good profit margins from the low workforce costs alone. In other cases investment in the human capital development, the improvement of the company processes and the adoption of new technologies are seen as necessary to improve the productivity. The same analysis can be applied to unemployment benefits as well. There is proof that extended unemployment benefits lead (contrary to the imagination of the general public) to higher GDP, because it opens space for more optimal employer-employee contracts where the employer can get more skilled and loyal employees. Extended unemployment benefits usually lead to the higher unemployment as well but it can be good for the economy, because unemployed people can invest more in gaining skills and knowledge and pursuing for the better workplaces that it could be possible if benefits had not been in place. Some proponents of internal devaluation are right wing politicians who do not believe in investments made by government, but their ideological imagination can be put in perspective if one considers the persistent calls of the European Central Bank and other notable institutions not to reduce government investments during expenditure cuts when fiscal consolidation is done. * Myth 2: sovereign default is the ultimate evil of the economy of one's country. Actually some academic literature about sovereign default fails to find any negative medium term consequences of sovereign default. Having said that, opponents of the internal devaluation do not propose default as the solution of the economic problems, instead, they simply point that other goals (e.g. boosting the productivity, investments and increase of GDP and not the putting caps on the sovereign debt) should be taken into account when political decisions are made. * Myth 3: fiscal stability is the main basis for the growth of economy and for avoiding the financial crisis. According to critics of internal devaluation, this is a myth if one considers some of the countries where internal devaluation is being applied. Those countries had relatively small debt of the general government before the start of the financial crisis, and the debt has grown immensely during the crisis (mainly for providing government backing for private commercial banks and not for raising expenditures for structural reforms or social safety net). Instead the rapid growth of private debt and equally rapid end to this growth in these countries has led to the financial crisis. The critics say no fiscal solution can prevent similar scenarios recurring in the future. Some argue that the role of central banks should be increased in taming the eventual growth of private debt, e.g. central banks could base reserve requirements to commercial banks based on their assets (e.g. in outstanding mortgage debt vs. debt to private, export-oriented companies) and not on their liabilities as is usually done. Practices Critics say some practices of internal devaluation are quite dirty: * There was at least one case when the right wing majority of the parliament consciously voted into law a bill whose annotation clearly stated that this bill (if adopted) could violate some articles of the constitution, including the article of the \\"core\\" of the constitution that defines the country as independent and democratic republic. Later the constitutional court found that the bill indeed had violated the constitution, including the \\"core\\" article of the constitution. The initial bill (with annotation) was approved and signed by the right wing prime minister and minister of finances. * In many cases there has been lack of necessary public debate and discussions by the experts about the necessary changes in the legislation when the measures of the internal devaluation had been adopted (in fact, the previously mentioned anti-constitutional bill had explicit note that the bill (despite its potential violation of the constitution) had not been discussed with the experts). In many cases such measures were adopted in artificially created rush when the right wing governments in power had not wanted their proposals to be questioned. Right wing politicians in command of the internal devaluation in some cases had managed to create impression in the general public (especially before elections) that they were more centric or left leaning that it was in reality. Similarly, the right wing politicians also used (in some cases) ethnic tensions and public debates about uncertain but divisive questions about history to garner public support (ethnic tensions are artificially created by some politicians before elections in the mentioned country, there are no tensions in everyday life, e.g., the mixed marriages are mundane). Actually, lack of clear understanding of the differences between left and right wing economic policies by the general public and the focus on the ethnic questions arguably have been the true reasons why at least one right-wing government has survived the elections even after the internal devaluation had been implemented. * The growing unemployment resulted in the reduction of wages indeed but the actual result was miserable - e.g. - at least one company had even reported that it was retracting the use of technologies and was restarting the old practices of manual labour, because it was cheaper to find new human employees than to use the technologies. The Internal devaluation can indeed increase the productivity that is defined as the ratio between the added value and labour expenses, but the internal devaluation usually fails to increase the productivity that is defined as the ratio between the added value and the hours worked. Therefore, the capital owners are the main winners of the internal devaluation (in the short-run, namely, because there is no long-run winners of the internal devaluation), but the general welfare is stagnating or even decreasing because of the smaller income per hour and because of wasted human capital that is used inefficiently in the companies that are building its profit margin on the low cost workforce and not by the use of technologies. * Usually it is advised to combine the internal devaluation with the structural reforms in the government and the economy. In practice there had been lot of calls to implement more structural reforms and not to have flat (bookkeeper-style) cuts of expenditures across all parts of the economy. But one should take into account that structural reforms usually contradicts the internal devaluation, because the structural reforms require flexible and skilled workforce. Structural reforms usually result in high unemployment and attract a lot of criticism if workforce can not adapt and this lack of flexibility usually is due to lack or available resources (education expenses, time for gaining new skills and experience, etc.). There is at least one case when the country is left with immensely large structural unemployment after the internal devaluation. * Some of the right wing politicians who are the biggest defenders of the internal devaluation have questionable moral standards. They are keen to complain about the lack of money in the treasury but at the same time they can adopt questionable practices for privatisation of state owned bank (as could be seen from the interpolation debates in the parliament) or they can even exploit loopholes in the tax code for personal gains. At the same time there was at least one case when the representative of the right wing government has stood in the parliament and reported that the government has consciously refused to issue at least one regulation (related to the social security matters) that was required by the standing laws of the country because of lack of money in treasury. * Central government can be keen to transfer its responsibilities to municipalities, sometimes without providing them with the necessary tax incomes. The debate about seniority of claims on mortgage debtors was some example how such governments prefer to create favourable conditions for foreign banks and decrease the opportunities of work for municipal companies. There are lot of other examples as well. * There is question whether it is justifiable to have bailouts of failing banks when the country is going through the internal devaluation and when the country requires additional resources (that could be transferred from the bailout funds) for structural reforms. Future There are cases when the internal devaluation can be seen as the right solution indeed (as opposite to the external devaluation or other measures). E.g. for some countries which participate in the monetary unions and for countries whose currencies are considered to be already undervalued. But in both cases the internal devaluation can be no more than the substitute for the more profound and effective measures which should be taken. E.g. one should greatly improve the movement freedoms for workforce, goods, services and capitals for the monetary unions to attain the situation where the single currency regime functions smoothly for all the regions some of which are in the different positions of the economic cycle than others. The estimation of any political decision should take into account the global development of the economy as well. E.g. one can consider the total income and how it is split into the two parts - the income from the capital and the income from the labor. One can observe that the share of the total income that is generated by the labor has declined by some 10% in the last decade or so. This can be partially attributed to the decreased workforce costs (because many large economies has adopted the free market principles and became more integrated in the global trade) but large part of this can be attributed to the development of the technologies. Therefore, - if the internal devaluation is all about the costs of workforce then it can be dreadful for the future, because the future economies apparently will require more and more skilled (and not cheaper) workforce and companies will adopt technologies for all the job positions where it will be profitable (the development of technologies is making more and more technologies available for profitable use in companies) and therefore those work positions will be lost for employees altogether.

According to reviewer Richie Unterberger, \\"the group shone brightest on their instrumentals, which used mounds of Fender reverb and two rhythm guitars; when they sang, the results were much less successful.\\" Patterson and Fifield shared lead vocals, and the band recorded songs by Roger Christian, Gary Usher, Dick Dale and Henry Mancini, among others.

Ferry service was introduced on the river in 1695, and developed at several points. The Upper and Lower Landings each developed somewhat independently, but over time became united into a long linear village, caused in part by the steep terrain immediately to the east which limited growth in that direction. Both landings flourished up to the American Civil War, as centers of international commerce doing business with the East and West Indies. The landings declined in economic importance after the war, owing to the rise of the railroad as the principal means of commercial transport, which was run up the west side of the river. The southern landing eventually became more significant as a tourist destination, and is where the East Haddam Bridge is now located, as is the village's commercial district.

The dog works in close cooperation with the handler, who is only allowed to use whistles, verbal or hand signals to direct his dog. No verbal or physical corrections are used in Treibball. The dog and handler must communicate effectively to herd one ball at a time into the goal, in fifteen minutes time. The dog and handler team are scored on cooperation and direction, within that fifteen-minute time limit, and can earn extra points or accrue demerits accordingly. The balls have been referred to as \\"rolling sheep\\" in recognition that this sport stems from herding for dogs who do not have access to regular sheep.

The building stands on a public square in the city's downtown commercial district. Built during the Indiana Gas Boom, most of the construction work was completed in 1894. The current courthouse was preceded by another courthouse building on the same site, which was declared inadequate by a judge in 1893, and was torn down. Following the condemnation of the original courthouse, the county's judicial activities were temporarily located in a building across the street. The current courthouse was designed by architects Arthur LaBelle and Burt L. French, who were from nearby Marion, Indiana. The building's architectural style is Richardsonian Romanesque, which was popular during the second half of the 19th century. The large corner tower of the building is the tallest structure in the downtown commercial district. Considered \\"the county's most outstanding landmark\\", the structure is often pictured on web sites associated with the area, and continues to house local government over 100 years after its construction. In addition to the courthouse building, the buildings around the courthouse square are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Hartford City Courthouse Square Historic District. The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. Most of the buildings in the Courthouse Square Historic District continue to have facades that look similar to their original design. Although the interior has been remodeled, the exterior of the courthouse also retains its original appearance. History The small cluster of log cabins called Hartford was designated the county seat of Blackford County in 1837, when legislation to create the county was proposed. Despite being created in 1838, no county government was organized until 1839, and there was some dissent over the location of the county seat. During June 1939, Indiana Governor David Wallace appointed Nicholas Friend as the new county's sheriff, and elections were held soon thereafter. The log cabin homes of county officials served as county government buildings during the first year of the county's organized existence. County affairs were first handled at the log cabin home of Andrew Boggs, which was located just north of Little Lick Creek in Licking Township. This cabin was, in effect, the capitol of Blackford County for about three months. =Site= Among the first orders made by the new county government was a survey of of wilderness located to the north of Boggs‚Äô cabin, parts of which had been donated for the purpose of housing the seat of government. A public square was to be located on of land, on which the seat of justice was to be located. It was also ordered that the seat of justice was to be named Hartford. The were owned by three individuals living in an adjacent county. The owners donated every other lot to the county as part of a plan to ensure that the county seat was located there‚Äîand increase the value of their property. Despite the county government's orders and plans, no action was taken on constructing a courthouse. In September 1839, the county commissioners began conducting business in the home of Jacob Emshwiller. For a few months, the Emshwiller home was the new capitol of Blackford County. Montpelier, Indiana, is located in the northeastern portion of Blackford County, in Harrison Township. In late 1839, the location of the county seat was formally contested, as the citizens of Montpelier believed their community would be a better location. Montpelier had been platted in 1837, while the \\"town\\" of Hartford was still wilderness north of a cluster of log cabins. However, Licking Township, where Hartford was located, contained more of the county's population. Licking township did not have a platted community like Montpelier, but had attracted farmers because the land near Lick Creek had acceptable drainage. The board of commissioners ruled against Montpelier in a January 1840, session. In November 1840, the board ordered the construction of a courthouse‚Äîwhich was to be located in Hartford. The plan was for a , two- story, \\"hewed-log\\" courthouse. The commissioners went into considerable detail describing the building. However, the courthouse was not constructed because of continuing controversy over the location (Hartford or Montpelier) of the county seat. In 1841, the commissioners again settled on Hartford as the location for the county seat, and planning for Blackford County's original courthouse began. On September 11, 1841, the Blackford County board of commissioners ordered that written proposals should be received to build a courthouse on the public square in the town of Hartford. The building was to be square, high, and built of brick on a stone foundation. The courthouse grounds occupied instead of the proposed in 1839. =Original courthouse= The contract for Blackford County's first courthouse was let on December 7, 1841, and construction was supervised by Charles and William F. Jones. The proposed cost for the courthouse was $5,600. Until the courthouse was ready, rooms were rented from various members of the community for conducting county government. By May 1845, an arrangement was made for the upper floor to be used for court proceedings until the entire building was completed. Finally, in a special session held October 31, 1845, the board of commissioners found that the courthouse had been completed according to contract. The total cost for the courthouse building was $5,750. The small community grew to a population of 250 by 1850, and it took 30 more years to get close to a population of 1,500. Early during that period, \\"Hartford\\" became known as \\"Hartford City\\" because another Hartford existed elsewhere in the state. In 1887, Hartford City Gas and Oil Company drilled Hartford City's first natural gas well, and Hartford City's participation in the Indiana Gas Boom began. The area experienced a period of economic growth and prosperity as manufacturers moved to the region to utilize the low-cost energy. An 1887 description of the courthouse called it \\"a plain building‚Ä¶its architecture characteristic of the pioneer times\\". It also said the building \\"is still good enough were it only in better repair.\\" On January 19, 1893, Judge Joseph L. Custer declared the \\"courtroom to be an inadequate place for the transaction of the business of this court\\", and that court business \\"be held elsewhere in some suitable place in the county seat.\\" =Current courthouse= alt=Commemorative plaque inside courthouse The county commissioners responded in March 1893, to the Judge's declaration that the (original) courthouse was inadequate. The three commissioners, T. T. McGeath, I. L. Hughs, and A. W. Miles, ordered that a new courthouse was necessary. A week later, they engaged the Marion firm of LaBelle and French as architects for the new courthouse. Since the original courthouse was condemned, and Judge Custer (of the 48th Circuit Court of Indiana) refused to use it, arrangements were made to use the nearby opera house for courtroom proceedings until a new courthouse was available. On May 20, 1893, the old courthouse building was sold for $20, and removed from the grounds to enable construction of the new structure. In October, it was decided that the opera house was not suitable for courtroom proceedings because of possible theatrical conflicts, so rooms were rented at the newly built Briscoe Block building located on the south side of the courthouse square. Two rooms, with gas heat included, were rented for a total of $400 per year. One room would be for the circuit court, while the other was for the county clerk's office. On June 8, 1893, LaBelle and French provided the county commissioners with a complete plan for the new courthouse. The architects designed a monumental stone courthouse in the Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style that was popular in the United States at that time. The four-story building measured . It featured enormous arches on the northern and southern facades, semicircular towers on the east and west sides, and a clock tower on the southwest corner. Although the community planned to build the courthouse as a monument to the city's (Gas Boom-related) prosperity, the commissioners were still concerned with costs. In late July 1893, the commissioners awarded the courthouse construction contract to the Fort Wayne firm of Boseker & Son. The price was cut to $97,000 by altering some of the architect's specifications. The stone chosen for the building was Amherst Blue from quarry number 9 in Amherst, Ohio. Work on the foundation was conducted in August, and the foundation stones were brought to town from Montpelier quarries located on the other side of the county. On November 1, 1893, the city held a ceremony for the laying of the courthouse cornerstone. The local Free and Accepted Masons Lodge Number 106 ran the program. The ceremony included a parade, a welcome by prosecutor J. A. Hindman, a Masonic ceremony, an address by Mason Past Grand Master Martin H. Rice, and an address by historian Benjamin G. Shinn. Although a harsh winter sometimes made work difficult, construction of the courthouse progressed far enough that work on the large (3 stories high) arch on the southern fa√ßade began during February 1894. Around the same time, work to carve the frieze above the second story was sublet to Gustave Steuber. Much of the carving work around the building's entrances was conducted under Mr. Steuber's direction. The building's cornice was finished in April, and nearly all of the structure's stone was cut by that time. By June, work was started on the clock tower, and almost all of the roof was completed in August. The tower's clock arrived by rail in August from New Haven, Connecticut‚Äîalthough the tower was not ready to accommodate the timepiece until October. Installation of the clock was completed in November. By February 1895, the courthouse contractor considered the courthouse finished. On February 27, 1895, county officials began moving into the new courthouse. Total cost for the new courthouse was $129,337. Most of that expense was paid to the contractor, Boseker and Son. Among other expenses included in the total were $2,000 paid to the E. Howard Clock Company of Boston, $7,000 for furniture paid to the H. Ohmer and Sons Company, and $6,158 for architecture. After the courthouse was completed, it was discovered that some modifications were needed for its plumbing and heating system. Outside of the courthouse, steps were also taken to beautify the surrounding grounds. Sidewalks were added, and eventually hitching racks for horses. A war memorial was added to the northeast corner of the courthouse grounds in 1921, and this was the first of the major war memorials that occupy the corners of the courthouse lawn. A total of nine memorials, monuments and commemorative plaques have been added to the grounds within the courthouse square. Today, the courthouse is still used by local government, and has a mailing address of 110 West Washington Street, Hartford City, Indiana. Hartford City's ZIP code is 47348. Courtroom facilities on the second floor of courthouse are used by the Blackford County Circuit Court and Blackford County Superior Court. The Blackford County Prosecutor also maintains an office in the building. The Blackford County commissioners meet on the first floor of the courthouse, and the county Clerk's office is also located on that floor. Additional office space is provided in the Blackford County Courthouse Annex, which is located across the street on the west side of the courthouse. The annex has an address of 121 North High Street. Among the offices housed in the annex building are the Blackford County Community Foundation, the Blackford County Emergency Operations Center, and the Blackford County Economic Development Corporation (including the County Assessor). Architecture Designed by the firm known as LaBelle and French of Marion, Indiana, the Blackford County Courthouse is considered an excellent example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, which was popular at the time. LaBelle and French also designed the White County courthouse in Monticello, Indiana; the Trumbull County courthouse in Warren, Ohio; and other buildings in the region. Listed December 31, 1974, the Trumbull County courthouse is also part of the National Register of Historic Places. Unfortunately, the White County courthouse was severely damaged by a \\"direct hit\\" from a 1974 tornado (rated as \\"EF4\\" using the Enhanced Fujita Scale), and therefore demolished. LaBelle and French also designed one of Hartford City's hotels, and one of the city's many glass factories. =Exterior= The courthouse was built using Henry Hobson Richardson's variation of the Romanesque Revival style of architecture‚Äîwhich later became known as Richardsonian Romanesque. Constructed mostly during 1894, the four‚Äìstory building features a 165-foot clock tower located on the southwest corner, and is the tallest structure in the area. The roof is a high pitched hip roof, and exterior walls are made from stone. The northern and southern facades of the structure are similar‚Äîeach consisting of three bays. The central bay is occupied by a massive round-arched portal with enriched archivolts and a fan window. From the ground-floor doorway to the top of the large central bay arch measures about three stories high. A gabled dormer rises above the central arch. The dormer has three double-hung windows, and a central arched window resides above the middle. Each of the side bays has a set of windows for each floor, and the third floor windows are crowned with arched windows. The huge clock tower is the main difference between the north and south facades. Located on the southwest corner of the courthouse, it is topped by a steeply-pitched roof with round corner piers. Blind arcading is used on the upper portion of the tower between the clock faces and the roof of the main portion of the building. Three rows of slit windows are utilized within the blind arcading. A clock face can be seen on all four sides of the tower. An arch supported by Corinthian pilasters houses each face of the clock. The east and west sides of the courthouse are identical up to the roofline. The west side also has the corner clock tower, which appears on the right when viewing toward the east. Both east and west sides have six bays. The first, third, fourth, and sixth bays have dual windows on each floor. A fan window crowns the dual windows on the third floor. The second and fifth bays are occupied by semicircular towers that rise above the bottom of the main roofline. The towers have three main windows on each floor, and the third floor windows are crowned with transoms that are crowned with fan windows. Above the towers‚Äô third floor fan windows, near the top of the tower, are small arched windows resting above belt courses. As time has passed, renovations and updates have been made to the courthouse and surrounding grounds. However, the courthouse exterior has retained its original form. Many of the nearby buildings, which were also built in the 1890s, also retain much of their original form. In 1940, the hitching racks around the courthouse square were removed, as automobiles had replaced horses as the preferred mode of transportation. Parking meters were added to the square in 1952. The building's stone exterior was refreshed by a sandblasting treatment in 1963. Exterior spotlights were added during the 1980s. The latest project to refurbish the courthouse moved forward during 2010. On December 6, 2010, the county commissioners decided to proceed with a courthouse preservation project that was estimated to cost in excess of $325,000. =Interior= alt=Wall, artwork, and ceiling inside courthouseThe interior of the Blackford County courthouse has a twenty-two feet wide main hallway that runs between the northern and southern facades. The original floors were tiled, and the walls were wainscoted with marble. Stairways to the second floor are located on both the north and south sides. The south side stairway continues from the second floor to the third floor. The north side of the third floor is occupied by the courtroom, and this room accounts for about half of the floor. The space adjacent to the north-south hallway on all three floors is used for offices with the exception of the third-floor courtroom and a small library. The fourth floor is unfinished and used for storage. From the fourth floor, one can ascend a narrow stairway to the top of the bell tower. The three finished interior floors have been renovated, modernized, and updated since the original construction. One step in modernization occurred in 1965, when an elevator was installed in the building. Among various renovations, the second and third floors were updated around 1980. Currently, the first floor has carpeting, fluorescent lighting, and acoustic ceiling tiles. The north and south facades now have modern glass doors that form vestibules at the entrances. The hallway ceilings have been molded with stenciling. Some painted scenes, which are not original to the building, can be found in the main hallway. One such scene includes a painting of the original courthouse surrounded by paintings of tablets representing each of the county's four townships, each with local scenes. Other features The public square where the Blackford County Courthouse stands is the heart of the Hartford City Courthouse Square Historic District. In addition to the courthouse in the center of the square, each corner of the square is the site of a war memorial, including one that is considered a contributing property to the Hartford City Courthouse Square Historic District. Additional memorials are also located on the grounds. =Revolutionary War memorial= alt=diagram of courthouse groundsOn the southwest corner of the courthouse stands the county's Revolutionary War memorial. Consisting of a commemorative plaque on a large stone, the memorial was placed in honor of Blackford County's five Revolutionary War veterans buried within the county. A dedication ceremony was conducted on June 17, 1933, by the Nancy Knight Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The dedicatory address was given by the Reverend H. C. Cornuelle, pastor of the local First Presbyterian Church. The stone was from the Twin Hills gravel pit in nearby Jay County. =World War I memorial= Blackford County's World War I memorial was unveiled on the northeast corner of the courthouse square on September 28, 1921, in a dedication ceremony with James Taylor, president of Taylor University as the speaker. The memorial is a reproduction of a sculpture known as the \\"Spirit of the American Doughboy\\", which was created by Ernest Moore Viquesney. Beneath the Doughboy sculpture is a list of Blackford County residents that served in World War I. The monument was partially funded by a contribution from the ladies of the Service Star Legion. =World War II memorial= Blackford County's World War II memorial is located on the northwest corner of the courthouse square. Its dedication ceremony was held on May 30, 1950. City attorney Robert Bonham gave the dedication address. The monument lists over 1,880 names of veterans associated with Blackford County. =Korea and Vietnam War memorial= Blackford County's monument to veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars is located on the southeast corner of the courthouse square. Congressman David Dennis spoke at the 1973 dedication of this monument. The monument, originally contained a list of the county's war dead from the two wars. It was expanded in 1987 to include all of the county's veterans of the two wars. A tablet on the left of the monument lists veterans of the Korean War, while a tablet on the right side lists veterans of the Vietnam War. =Monument to Veterans of the Civil War= alt=statue of World War I soldierBlackford County's Civil War monument is located on the southwest corner of the courthouse square. The Blackford County Civil War Re-enactment Club is responsible for the monument. The project began with a Memorial fund in 1997, and progressed for about 10 years to completion of the project. Construction of the monument began in 2004 with a granite base, pedestal, and walkway. A dedication for that portion of the monument was held on October 9, 2004. The sculpture of the civil war soldier was added a few years later. Stacks of black granite cannonballs were added to each corner of the monument in 2007. The monument recognizes all soldiers associated with Blackford County: soldiers who lived in the county at the start of the war, soldiers who enlisted in the county, soldiers buried in the county, and veterans who moved to the county after the war. =Other monuments and commemorative plaques= The Blackford County Courthouse lawn is also the site of some smaller commemorative plaques. An early addition was the Orville Whitacre Memorial Marker, which was added in 1922. The H. C. Cornuelle Memorial Marker was added in 1936. The Reverend Herbert C. Cornuelle served in World War I as a chaplain in the United States Army. After the war, the American Legion named him chaplain for the state of Indiana. He also became the minister of Hartford City's First Presbyterian Church‚Äîserving from 1928 until 1936. During Work War I, Cornuelle suffered permanent injury from a gas attack, and his injury contributed to his death from pneumonia on April 21, 1936. A second plaque, the Bicentennial Capsule Marker, was also added in 1936. Many years later, a Blackford County Courthouse Cornerstone Rededication Marker was added in a ceremony on November 13, 1993. The Free and Accepted Masons conducted the ceremony, and a time capsule was presented by the presidents of the Blackford County Historical Society and the Montpelier Historical Society. A Blackford County Courthouse Historical Marker was placed on October 1, 1994, by the Indiana Historical Bureau and the Blackford Lodge Number 106 of the Free and Accepted Masons. Significance The Blackford County Courthouse was added to National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1980. On June 21, 2006, its historic importance was reasserted when it was included as a contributing property in the Hartford City Courthouse Square Historic District's listing on the National Register. On its original National Register nomination form, the building was cited as significant in the areas of \\"architecture\\" and \\"politics/government.\\" The courthouse has been \\"the focus of governmental, political and civic affairs,\\" and \\"its size and architecture dominate\\" downtown Hartford City. In addition, the war memorials on the courthouse grounds contribute to the sense of time and place that the Hartford City Courthouse Historic District conveys.

It occupies the former second location of the Lutheran church of The Lutheran Church of Our Saviour, established in 1897 as a mission church of St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church and built in its second location at West 187th Street. The church building was built between 1925 and 1926 at a cost of $30,000 to designs by an architect Stoyan N. Karastoyanoff of 220 Audubon Avenue. The Lutheran congregation moved into their parish house after the Great Depression and the church and the Armenian Apostolic Church took over the church in 1929.Organ Website Church History (accessed 27 Dec 2010) On December 24, 1933, a group of assassins attacked Eastern Diocese Archbishop Levon Tourian as he walked down the aisle of Holy Cross Armenian Church in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City during the Divine Liturgy, and killed him with a butcher knife. Nine Tashnags were later arrested, tried and convicted. The incident divided the Armenian community, as Tashnag sympathizers established congregations independent of Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, declaring loyalty instead to the Holy See of Cilicia based in Antelias, Lebanon. After the assassination, the church was reconsecrated, with a new crypt added in 1934 to designs by Manoug Exerjian, who also refaced and renovated the church between 1952 and 1953.

His era marked the temporary end of an autonomous Yemeni polity in the highlands. The coming of the Ottomans Al-Mutahhar was a son of the imam al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad- Din, who ruled large parts of Yemen in the 1530s and 1540s. Since early years he showed good warrior skills, and assisted his father in gathering authority over the most of Yemen. The Ottoman Turks were placed in part of lower Yemen since 1539, but the extent of their power was still circumcised. As it turned out, al-Mutawakkil preferred another son as presumptive heir to his powers. Al-Mutahhar, frustrated, encouraged the Turks to expand from their base in the Tihamah.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 70. The Zaidis lost Ta'izz to the Ottoman forces in 1547, and their elite resolved to make al-Mutahhar their leader instead of the elderly al- Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din. Nevertheless, the Turks expanded steadily. San'a, which had been the Zaidi capital since 1517, fell on 23 August 1547. Submission and further resistance Al-Mutahhar took up a stance in the strong mountain stronghold Thula. He was not a man of doctrinal learning (mujtahid), and was furthermore lame; he therefore lacked some of the formal qualifications for a bona fide imam, as laid down by Zaydiyyah tradition, and was only imam in the sense of military leader. In 1552 he made peace with the Turks, who officially made him sancakbey, with authority over the districts north-west of Sana'a. In 1566, Turkish misbehaviour gave rise to dissatisfaction among parts of the Yemeni population that had hitherto been positive to the Ottoman presence. Al-Mutahhar headed the rebellion with considerable success. By 1568, the Turks were reduced to a minor coastal enclave.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p. 761-2. Then, however, the Ottoman sultan Selim II sent the redoubtable commander Sinan Pasha to Yemen with reinforcements. Al-Mutahhar was pushed back in 1569-70, but could not be entirely overcome.Robert W. Stookey, Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic. Boulder 1978, pp. 139-41. Sinan Pasha eventually made a truce with al-Mutahhar at Kawkaban. The imam died in relative obscurity in 1572, of blood in the urine. There was no unity among his sons, who controlled various districts.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, 1983, p. 70. His nephew Ali bin Shams ad-Din acknowledged the authority of the Ottomans against being allowed to keep Kawkaban as a fief. Ali's descendants adhered to the Porte until 1626, and were able to rule as amirs in Kawkaban until 1872.Michel Tuchscherer, Imams, notables et bedouins du Y√©men au XVIII si√®cle. Caire 1992, pp. 25-6. The defeat and death of al-Mutahhar marked the beginning of a long period of Ottoman domination which was only broken by the Qasimid imams in the early 17th century. Al-Mutahhar also persecuted the Taiyabi Ismaili Shia sect, leading to the seat of leadership to shift from Yemen to Gujarat, India. See Yusuf Najmuddin ibn Sulaiman for further information.

It is notable as one of the few lighthouses whose original lens was a first order Fresnel lens, the strongest type of Fresnel lens. It is a Registered Tangible Cultural Property of Japan. The lighthouse is located within the borders of the Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park. History Although not one of eight lighthouses to be built in Meiji period Japan under the provisions of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858, signed by the Bakumatsu period Tokugawa Shogunate, the need for a lighthouse at Cape Inub≈ç for the safety of vessels on the northeastern approaches to Tokyo was recognized at an early time after Japan was opened to the West. The wreck of the Tokugawa navy warship Mikaho in a typhoon on the rocks of Cape Inub≈ç with the loss of 13 lives on October 6, 1868 further emphasized the need for a lighthouse. The lighthouse was designed and constructed by British engineer Richard Henry Brunton, born 1841 in Kincardineshire, Scotland, who was under contract by the new Meiji government. Brunton constructed another 25 lighthouses from far northern Hokkaid≈ç to southern Ky≈´sh≈´ during his career in Japan. The Inub≈çsaki Lighthouse was lit on November 15, 1874. The structure consisted of a cylindrical tower made from the first domestically-produced red bricks in Japan. Brunton supervised the construction of a brick factory in Tomioka Village in what is now part of Narita City, which produced 193,000 bricks for the project. However, Brunton was uncertain of the mechanical strength of the Japanese bricks, so he constructed the tower using a double thickness for the walls. The tower, at 31.5 meters, is also the second tallest brick lighthouse in Japan, surpassed only by the Shiriyazaki Lighthouse (also built by Brunton) in Higashid≈çri, Aomori Prefecture. Repairs for historical preservation and improvements in earthquake safety were made in 1977. The Inub≈çsaki Lighthouse is currently open to the public, who may visit a small museum at its base, and climb to the top for a panoramic view over the Pacific Ocean. It is registered with the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities as one of the ‚ÄúOne Hundred Most Important Lighthouses in the World\\".The lighthouse is currently maintained by the Japan Coast Guard. Furthermore, in 2020, it was registatered on Important Cultural Property (Japan)news that Inubosaki Lighthouse was registered on Important Cultural Property (Japan).

Brunton constructed a total of 25 lighthouses in Japan from far northern Hokkaid≈ç to southern Ky≈´sh≈´ during his career in Japan, each with a different design. Built of domestically-produced white bricks, the Sugashima Lighthouse is styled in the manner of a European castle round tower, complete with crenellations. It replaced a more primitive light established by the Tokugawa shogunate on the island in 1673 in response to numerous shipwrecks in the area.

History  The Anorisaki Lighthouse was designed and constructed by British engineer Richard Henry Brunton and was first lit on April 1, 1873. It is the first lighthouse in Japan to use a rotating Fresnel lens. The octagonal structure was built of Zelkova serrata wood and had a total height of 10.6 metres. Brunton constructed 25 lighthouses from far northern Hokkaid≈ç to southern Ky≈´sh≈´ during his career in Japan, each with a different design. Although Anorisaki Lighthouse was the 20th of the 25 built by Brunton, it was the oldest with a wooden construction. This lighthouse was relocated five meters inland from its original location in 1911 due to coastal erosion. It was electrified in 1932. In 1948, it was replaced by a more modern design, and the original structure designed by Brunton was later relocated to the Museum of Maritime Science in Tokyo. The modern replacement was completed in August 1948 and is a square ferro-concrete structure with a height of 12.7 metres. The lens was upgraded to a 4th order Fresnel in 1950.

History The original Kannonsaki Lighthouse was the first lighthouse built in Japan. It was one of the eight lighthouses whose construction was stipulated by the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858. The treaty provided for the development of aids to navigation with the opening of Japanese ports to foreign trade. Modern engineering methods had not been developed in Japan at the time so the Tokugawa Shogunate requested the assistance of the authorities of France and England for the construction of lighthouses and the purchasing of necessary equipment. The Tokugawa Shogunate specifically planned to construct a lighthouse at the mouth of Tokyo Bay for vessels that would leave the Yokosuka Iron Works then under construction. After the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate The new Meiji government commenced construction of the first lighthouse with Francois Leon Verny, an employee of the Yokosuka Iron Works, as the chief engineer. The work was commenced in November 1868, and completed after four months. The Lighthouse was first lit on February 11, 1869 during the last months of the Boshin War. The original lighthouse was a western style building made of brick (made at the Yokosuka Iron Works under the instruction of Francois Leon Verny), rectangular in shape, and painted white. It was immediately followed, in December 1869, by the completion of the Nojimazaki Lighthouse, also by L√©once Verny, on the other side of Tokyo Bay. As structures made of brick are weak against earthquakes, the lighthouse was completely destroyed by the earthquake that occurred on April 26, 1922. The reconstruction of the lighthouse as a reinforced concrete structure was completed on March 15, 1923. However, the new lighthouse functioned for only six months before again being damaged by the Great Kant≈ç earthquake of September 1, 1923 (magnitude 7.9), the lighthouse was fractured with cracks and the top collapsed. Restoration work on the lighthouse was commenced on September 18, 1924 and, on June 1, 1925, the present Kannonsaki Lighthouse was completed.

During the late-19th century, Moore became a land speculator and purchased the area that has since been named in his honour, Moore Park. To increase the value of his land, he then constructed a bridge (the original Vale of Avoca) and helped promote the Belt Line Railway, an early public transit system serving the \\"suburbs\\" of Toronto, Ontario. After the Belt Line was constructed, recession forced its closure after only 18 months of operation. Its railbed has since been converted into the Beltline Trail. Moore was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1905 Alberta general election defeating high-profile Conservative candidate and the founder of Red Deer Leonard Gaetz. Moore attempted to run for a second term in office but was defeated in the 1909 Alberta general election by Independent candidate Edward Michener. Moore return to Toronto and died there in 1917.
