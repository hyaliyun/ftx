It is also the chef-lieu (administrative centre) of the arrondissement of the same name. Location The town is situated about 200 km from Paris, 85 km north-east of Reims, and 10 km south of the border with Belgium. The historic centre occupies a peninsula formed by a bend in the River Meuse. History Sedan was founded in 1424. In the 16th century S√©dan was an asylum for Protestant refugees from the Wars of Religion. Until 1651, the Principality of Sedan belonged to the La Tour d'Auvergne family. It was at that time a sovereign principality. Their representative, Marshal Turenne, was born at Sedan on 11 September 1611. With help from the Holy Roman Empire, it defeated France at the Battle of La Marf√©e. Immediately after its victory, Sedan was besieged and its prince, Fr√©d√©ric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon, submitted to France. It was annexed to France in return for sparing the prince's life after he became involved in a conspiracy against France. Sedan was the birthplace of Jacques MacDonald, a general who served in the Napoleonic Wars. During the Franco-Prussian War, on 2 September 1870, French emperor Napoleon III was taken prisoner with 100,000 of his soldiers at the First Battle of Sedan. Due to this victory, which made the unification of Germany possible, 2 September was declared Sedan Day (Sedantag) and a national German holiday in 1871. It remained a holiday until 1919. Sedan was occupied by the Germans for four years during World War I. On 13 November 1917, the German Crown Prince paraded the 13th Infantry Division over the course of \\"d'Alsace-Lorraine\\". From May 12 to 15, 1940, during World War II, German troops invaded neutral Belgium and crossed the Meuse River by winning the Second Battle of Sedan . The battle allowed them to win the Battle of France by bypassing the Maginot Line, which was the French fortification system, and entrapping the Allied Forces that were advancing east into Belgium, as part of the Allied Dyle Plan strategy. Points of interest =Castle= Today Sedan is known for its castle, that is claimed to be the largest fortified medieval castle in Europe with a total area of on seven levels. Construction started in 1424 and the castle's defences were constantly improved over the ages. It is the only remaining part of the once enormous fortifications in and around the town.

It was Madonna's first movie, filmed around September 1979, but not released until 1985. The film is an \\"oddball\\" independent film, shot on-and-off over two years in New York City for just $20,000. Madonna finished her scenes in late 1980. Almost all of the cast were unpaid.  Plot  Madonna plays the part of Bruna, a Lower East Side resident who lives with three \\"love slaves\\" (one male, one female, one transgender). Bruna meets Dashiell (Pattnosh) in the water fountain in Washington Square Park and the two \\"fall in love\\". Bruna later tells her lovers she does not need them anymore, resulting in them attacking her sexually; this scene caused controversy, as Madonna is topless. Later, Bruna is raped by Raymond Hall (Kurtz) in a bathroom at a coffee shop. To exact retribution, Bruna enlists her love slaves and Dashiell to abduct the rapist. They dress up as prostitutes and lure him into a limousine. They lead him to a theatre where a Satanic sacrifice is performed. Dashiell later wipes Raymond's blood all over Bruna.  Production  Despite Madonna's second thoughts about having participated in this movie, Lewicki had nothing but compliments for her. One of his oft-repeated stories was how he \\"discovered\\" Madonna and was amazed that she hand-wrote a three-page letter for a part that did not even pay. She was only paid $100, only because she was short on her apartment rent and Lewicki paid to help out. In Christopher Andersen's 1991 biography, Madonna Unauthorized, Lewicki stated: \\"That woman has more sensuality in her ear than most women have anywhere on their bodies\\". Actor Jeremy Pattnosh wrote and performed several songs in the film, including: \\"Certain Sacrifice\\" and \\"Screamin' Demon Lover\\".  Release  In 1985, A Certain Sacrifice was released on video to capitalize on Madonna's fame, and in 1986, there were theatrical midnight screenings. Madonna tried to buy the rights from director Stephen Jon Lewicki for $5,000. Unsuccessful, she then attempted to ban the film from being seen. Stephen Lewicki invited her to view it; Madonna was reportedly unhappy with the result. According to Lewicki, she had an expression of horror on her face and screamed \\"Fuck you\\" as she stormed out of his apartment.

It is both the capital of the province of Namur and of Wallonia, hosting the Parliament of Wallonia, Walloon Government and administration. Namur stands at the confluence of the Sambre and Meuse rivers and straddles three different regions - Hesbaye to the north, Condroz to the south-east, and Entre-Sambre- et-Meuse to the south-west. The city of Charleroi is located to the west. The language spoken is French. The City of Namur includes the old communes of Beez, Belgrade, Saint-Servais, Saint-Marc, Bouge, Champion, Daussoulx, Flawinne, Malonne, Suarl√©e, Temploux, Vedrin, Boninne, Cognel√©e, Gelbress√©e, Marche-les-Dames, Dave, Jambes, Naninne, W√©pion, Wierde, Erpent, Lives-sur- Meuse, and Loyers. History Namur in 1838 The town began as an important trading settlement in Celtic times, straddling east-west and north-south trade routes across the Ardennes. The Romans established a presence after Julius Caesar defeated the local Aduatuci tribe. Namur came to prominence during the early Middle Ages when the Merovingians built a castle or citadel on the rocky spur overlooking the town at the confluence of the two rivers. In the 10th century, it became a county in its own right. The town developed somewhat unevenly, as the counts of Namur could only build on the north bank of the Meuse - the south bank was owned by the bishops of Li√®ge and developed more slowly into the town of Jambes (now effectively a suburb of Namur). In 1262, Namur fell into the hands of the Count of Flanders, and was purchased by Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1421. After Namur became part of the Spanish Netherlands in the 1640s, its citadel was considerably strengthened. Louis XIV of France invaded in 1692, capturing the town and annexing it to France. His renowned military engineer Vauban rebuilt the citadel. French control was short-lived, as William III of Orange-Nassau captured Namur only three years later in 1695 during the War of the Grand Alliance. Under the Barrier Treaty of 1709, the Dutch gained the right to garrison Namur, although the subsequent Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 gave control of the formerly Spanish Netherlands to the Austrian House of Habsburg. Thus, although the Austrians ruled the town, the citadel was controlled by the Dutch. It was rebuilt again under their tenure. General Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence's column laid siege to the city on 19 November 1792 during the War of the First Coalition and, after 12 days, the city surrendered on 1 December and its whole garrison of 3,000 men was taken prisoner. France invaded the region again in 1794, annexing Namur and imposing a repressive regime. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the Congress of Vienna incorporated what is now Belgium into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Belgium broke away from the Netherlands in 1830 following the Belgian Revolution, and Namur continued to be a major garrison town under the new government. The citadel was rebuilt yet again in 1887. Namur was a major target of the German invasion of Belgium in 1914, which sought to use the Meuse valley as a route into France. On August 21, 1914, the Germans bombarded the town of Namur without warning. Several people were killed. Despite being billed as virtually impregnable, the citadel fell after only three days' fighting and the town was occupied by the Germans for the rest of the war. Namur fared little better in World War II; it was in the front lines of both the Battle of the Ardennes in 1940 and the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. The town suffered heavy damage in both wars. Namur continued to host the Belgian Army's paratroopers until their departure in 1977. After the creation of the Walloon Region, Namur was chosen as the seat of its executive and parliament. In 1986, Namur was officially declared capital of Wallonia. Its position as regional capital was confirmed by the Parliament of Wallonia in 2010. Economy Namur, the Meuse, the Walloon Parliament and the citadel Namur is an important commercial and industrial centre, located on the Walloon industrial backbone, the Sambre and Meuse valley. It produces machinery, leather goods, metals and porcelain. Its railway station is also an important junction situated on the north-south line between Brussels and Luxembourg City, and the east-west line between Lille and Li√®ge. River barge traffic passes through the middle of the city along the Meuse. Culture and sights Namur has taken on a new role as the capital of the federal region of Wallonia. Its location at the head of the Ardennes has also made it a popular tourist centre, with a casino located in its southern district on the left bank of the Meuse. The town's most prominent sight is the citadel, now demilitarised and open to the public. Namur also has a distinctive 18th- century cathedral dedicated to Saint Aubain and a belfry classified by UNESCO as part of the Belfries of Belgium and France which are listed as a World Heritage Site. The Couvent des Soeurs de Notre-Dame used to contain masterpieces of Mosan art by Hugo d'Oignies, currently presented in the Mus√©e des Arts Anciens (Rue de Fer). Elsewhere there is an archeological museum and a museum dedicated to F√©licien Rops. An odd Namurois custom is the annual Combat de l'√âchasse d'Or (Fight for the Golden Stilt), held on the third Sunday in September. Two teams, the M√©lans and the Avresses, dress in medieval clothes while standing on stilts and do battle in one of the town's principal squares. Namur possesses a distinguished university, the University of Namur (previously known as the Facult√©s universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix, FUNDP), founded in 1831. The University of Louvain (UCLouvain) also has several facilities in the city through its UCLouvain Namur University Hospital (CHU UCLouvain Namur), the provinces' largest employer.

History =The foundation of Philippeville= At the beginning of the 16th century, the Philippeville region was on the boundary between Charles V‚Äôs Burgundian Netherlands and Francis I‚Äôs France. Fighting around Philippeville did not start, however, until 1554, after Henry II had succeeded his father on the throne. This area was ideal for an attack as it was covered with forests, sparsely populated and divided among the County of Hainaut, that of Namur, by now part of Burgundy, and the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. The medieval forts in the area were taken and pillaged one after the other. The fortress of Mariembourg, close to Couvin, and the town of Givet soon fell to the French. In 1555, Charles V's new commander, William the Silent, established a new fort in the village of Echerennes, a village known since the 9th century. He garrisoned his troops there as soon as the fort was completed, barely four months after the start of construction. In 1556, Charles V named his new fortress Philippeville in honour of his son, Philip II of Spain, who would succeed him in the Netherlands - and on the city - the following year. =From 1557 to present= In 1659, the Treaty of the Pyrenees stopped the Franco-Spanish War (1635‚Äì59) and most frontier cities became French, until Napoleon‚Äôs defeat at Waterloo. Philippeville itself was one of the final French fortresses to surrender following Waterloo in 1815. There was then a brief Dutch interlude until the Belgian Revolution in 1830. A treaty drafted in London on 15 November 1831, (Article I) which the Netherlands refused to sign, was followed by the Treaty of London (1839), which created the Kingdom of Belgium. Part of the terms of the treaty required the Philippeville's fortifications, along with those of Menin, Ath, Mons and Mariembourg, to be dismantled. Philippeville's defensive walls were dismantled in 1856 under the reign of King Leopold I, in accordance with the terms of the treaty, having been declared superfluous on account of Belgium's enforced neutrality, and have been replaced by the wide boulevards that circle the city today.

Overview The term Eurasian was first coined in mid-nineteenth century British India. The term was originally used to refer to those who are now known as Anglo-Indians, people of mixed British and Indian descent. In addition to British many were also of mixed Portuguese, Dutch, Irish or, more rarely, French descent. The term has been used in anthropological literature since the 1960s.Current Anthropology, Vol. 2, No. 1 (February 1961), p. 64. Specific groups =Central Asia= Genetics of Turkmens indicates a mixture of East Eurasian and West Eurasian populations. Historically, Central Asia has been a \\"melting pot\\" of West Eurasian and East Eurasian peoples, leading to high genetic admixture and diversity. Physical and genetic analyses of ancient remains have concluded that ‚Äì while the Scythians, including those in the eastern Pazyryk region ‚Äì possessed predominantly features found (among others) in Europoids, mixed Eurasian phenotypes were also frequently present, suggesting that the Scythians as a whole were descended in part from East Eurasian populations. The Xiongnu were nomadic warriors who invaded China and Central Asia. They were predominantly Mongoloid, known from their skeletal remains and artifacts. Analysis of skeletal remains from sites attributed to the Xiongnu provides an identification of dolichocephalic Mongoloid.Fu ren da xue (Beijing, China), S.V.D. Research Institute, Society of the Divine Word ‚Äì 2003 Russian and Chinese anthropological and craniofacial studies show that the Xiongnu were physically very heterogeneous, with six different population clusters showing different degrees of Mongoloid and Caucasoid physical traits.Tumen D., \\"Anthropology of Archaeological Populations from Northeast Asia page 25, 27 A majority (89%) of the Xiongnu mtDNA sequences can be classified as belonging to Asian haplogroups, and nearly 11% belong to European haplogroups. This finding indicates that contact between European and Asian populations preceded the start of Xiongnu culture, and confirms results reported for two samples from an early 3rd century BC Scytho-Siberian population (Clisson et al. 2002). Anthropologist SA Pletnev studied a group of burials of Kipchaks in the Volga region and found them to have Caucasoid features with some admixture of Mongoloid traits, with physical characteristics such as a flat face and distinctly protruding nose. They were nomadic people that, together with the Cumans, ruled areas stretching from Kazakhstan through Caucasus to Eastern Europe. Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu. His father was Tuvan, while his mother was Russian. The Hunnic invaders of Europe were also of mixed origins. Hungarian archaeologist Istv√°n B√≥na argues that most European Huns were of Caucasoid ancestry and that less than 20‚Äì25% were of Mongoloid stock.B√≥na, Istv√°n: \\"A Nagyr√©v-kult√∫ra telep√ºl√©seirol\\", 1991, p.30. In: Hyun Jin Kim, \\"The Huns, Rome and the Birth of Europe \\", Cambridge University Press, p.187 According to the Hungarian anthropologist P√°l Lipt√°k (1955) he believed Turanid race was most common among the Huns. He classified Turanid as a Caucasoid type with significant Mongoloid admixture, arising from the mixture of the Andronovo type of Europoid features and the Oriental (Mongoloid).Lipt√°k, P√°l. Recherches anthropologiques sur les ossements avares des environs d'√úll√∂ (1955) ‚Äì In: Acta archaeologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, vol. 6 (1955), pp. 231‚Äì314 Afghan hazara man The Eurasian Avars were group of sixth-century nomadic warriors that came from Northern Central Asia who ruled in what is today Central Europe. Anthropological research has revealed few skeletons with Mongoloid-type features, although there was continuing cultural influence from the Eurasian nomadic steppe. The early Avar anthropological material was said to be mostly Europoid in the seventh century according to P√°l Lipt√°k, while grave-goods indicated Middle and Central Asian parallels. Mongoloid and Euro-Mongoloid types compose about one-third of the total population of the Avar graves of the eighth century with the late Avar Period showing more hybridization resulting in higher frequencies of Europo- Mongolids. The Seljuk Empire which ruled from Central Asia, Middle East to modern Turkey, their descendants are the Iranian Turkmen and Afghan Turkmen and are mixture of East Eurasian and West Eurasian. King Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Ladislaus' mother was the daughter of a Cuman chief.Group of Eurasian girls in Indonesia around 1925‚Äì1930Like the Kipchaks, the Cuman invaders of Europe were also of mixed anthropological origins. Excavations in Csengele, Hungary, have revealed normatively East Asian and European traits. Five of the six skeletons that were complete enough for anthropometric analysis appeared Asian rather than European. Many Eurasian ethnic groups arose during the Mongol invasion of Europe. The ruling Mongol elites of the Mongol successor states began a process of assimilation with the non-Mongol populations that they ruled over. The Golden Horde which ruled eastern Europe resulted in a assmilation and mixture of Mongols, Turkic, Finno-Ugrians, Sarmato-Scythians, Slavs, and people from the Caucasus, among others (whether Muslim or not). Partial Mongol descendants of people from Central Asia and North Caucasus, such as the Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Nogais, also created many Eurasian ethnic groups under the empires they established (for example, the Timurid Empire, Mughal Empire, Kazakh Khanate, and Nogai Horde), which invaded or covered vast areas that are parts of modern Russia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia. =Southeast Asia= Xanana Gusm√£o, first President of East Timor. European colonization of vast swathes of Southeast Asia led to the burgeoning of Eurasian populations, particularly in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Timor-Leste, Vietnam and the Philippines. The majority of Eurasians in Southeast Asia formed a separate community from the indigenous peoples and the European colonizers, and served as middlemen between the two. Post- colonial Eurasians can be found in practically every country in Southeast Asia, most especially in the Philippines due to the 333 years of colonization by Spain, 4 years of British settlement and 49 years of American occupation which gives the country the longest unstopping 382 years of continuously European exposure in Southeast Asia. While Burma was colonized by the British for 124 years, the French colonized Indochina for 67 years, the British colonized Malaysia for 120 years and Dutch colonized Indonesia for 149 years after Portugal. Cambodia In the last official census in French Indochina in 1946, there were 45,000 Europeans in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. One-fifth were Eurasian.

GASCON.jpgJos√© Lu√≠s Mart√≠n Gascon File:Andr√©s Bonifacio.jpgAndr√©s Bonifacio File:1960 Neile Adams.jpgNeile Adams Eurasians are collectively called Mestizos in the Philippines. The vast majority are descendants of Spanish, Latino and American settlers who intermarried with people of indigenous Filipino descent. Aside from the more common Spanish, Latino and American mestizos, there are also Eurasians in the Philippines who have ancestries from various European countries or Australia. Significant intermarriage between Filipinos and European Americans has occurred since the United States colonial period up to the present day, as the US had numerous people stationed there at military bases. Most Eurasians of Spanish or Latino descent own business conglomerates in the real estate, agriculture, and utilities sector, whereas Eurasians of White American descent are largely in the entertainment industry which are one of the biggest industries in the Philippines working as reporters, writers, producers, directors, models, actors and actresses as modern Philippine mass media and entertainment industry was pioneered during the American colonization of the Philippines by the Americans. Many of them also works in offices and call centers; The Philippines being the call center capital of the world.The actual number of Eurasians in the Philippines cannot be ascertained due to lack of surveys, although Spanish censuses record that as much as one third of the inhabitants of the island of Luzon possess varying degrees of Spanish or Latino admixture. As opposed to the policies of other colonial powers such as the British or the Dutch, the Spanish colonies were devoid of any anti- miscegenation laws. Moreover, the Catholic Church not only never banned interracial marriage, but it even encouraged it. The Spanish implemented incentives to deliberately entangle the various races together in order to stop rebellion: ‚Äì It is needful to encourage public instruction in all ways possible, permit newspapers subject to a liberal censure, to establish in Manila a college of medicine, surgery, and pharmacy: in order to break down the barriers that divide the races, and amalgamate them all into one. For that purpose, the Spaniards of the country, the Chinese mestizos, and the Filipinos shall be admitted with perfect equality as cadets of the military corps; the personal-service tax shall be abolished, or an equal and general tax shall be imposed, to which all the Spaniards shall be subject. This last plan appears to me more advisable, as the poll-tax is already established, and it is not opportune to make a trial of new taxes when it is a question of allowing the country to be governed by itself. Since the annual tribute is unequal, the average shall be taken and shall be fixed, consequently, at fifteen or sixteen reals per whole tribute, or perhaps one peso fuerte annually from each adult tributary person. This regulation will produce an increase in the revenue of 200,000 or 300,000 pesos fuertes, and this sum shall be set aside to give the impulse for the amalgamation of the races, favoring crossed marriages by means of dowries granted to the single women in the following manner. To a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Filipino shall be given 100 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, Ioo pesos; to a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Spaniard, 1,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, 2,000 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Spaniard, 2,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Filipino chief, 3,000 or 4,000 pesos. Some mestizo and Filipino alcaldes-mayor of the provinces shall be appointed. It shall be ordered that when a Filipino chief goes to the house of a Spaniard, he shall seat himself as the latter's equal. In a word, by these and other means, the idea that they and the Castilians are two kinds of distinct races shall be erased from the minds of the natives, and the families shall become related by marriage in such manner that when free of the Castilian dominion should any exalted Filipinos try to expel or enslave our race, they would find it so interlaced with their own that their plan would be practically impossible. The fluid nature of racial integration in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period was recorded by many travelers and public figures at the time, who were favorably impressed by the lack of racial discrimination, as compared to the situation in other European colonies. Among them was Sir John Bowring, Governor General of British Hong Kong and a well- seasoned traveler who had written several books about the different cultures in Asia, who described the situation as \\"admirable\\" during a visit to the Philippines in the 1870s. > The lines separating entire classes and races, appeared to me less marked > than in the Oriental colonies. I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, > Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no > doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes > of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in > many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the > great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial > discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is > indeed admirable.L. Hunt, Chester, \\"Sociology in the Philippine setting: A > modular approach\\", p. 118, Phoenix Pub. House, 1954 Another foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had spent most of his life in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power: > \\"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not know > where I could find a colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with > the natives. > Not in Java, where a native of position must dismount to salute the > humblest Dutchman. > Not in British India, where the Englishwoman has now made the gulf between > British and native into a bottomless pit.\\"Frederic H. Sawyer, \\"The > Inhabitants of the Philippines, p. 125, New York, 1900 As of today European genes are spread throughout the country in great but specifically unknown scale, together with Chinese genes and Indian, Arabic and Japanese genes, that evolved modern Filipinos in a distinctive Austronesian path. In a research done by Dr. Michael Purugganan, NYU Dean of Science in 2013, he concluded that Filipinos today are the conclusion of an Austronesian's evolutionary result of almost 500 years of European (Hispanic/British/Americans) settling with the Natives and other migrant Asians in the Islands.

Singaporean Eurasians of European ancestry traces to emigrants of countries that span the length and breadth of Europe, although Eurasian migrants to Singapore in the 19th century came largely from other European colonies in Asia as well as Europe itself. When the European colonisation of Singapore began, the colonisers brought into being a new ethnic group known historically and generally as the Eurasians.Asian and Pacific Migration Journal 24 (2), 'The postcolonial ambiguities of Eurasian pan-ethnicity in Singapore', J. Lowe and M. Mac an Ghaill (2015, Page 234); Indonesia and the Malay World 43 (126), 'Children of Decolonisation: Postcolonial (Indo) Eurasian Communities in Indonesia and the Netherlands', R. Hewett (2015, Page 192) Early European colonisers were not accompanied by their womenfolk on the perilous journey to Asia. Consequently, many married the local women of these lands, or formed liaisons with them. Today, Singaporeans of Eurasian descent make up about 0.4% of the Singaporean population, with 16,900 individuals living in Singapore in 2015.

Many were the children of American servicemen who came to the country in the 1960s and the 1970s, when there were several large US military bases in the country because of the Vietnam War. While some of the servicemen formed lasting relationships with Thai women, some luk khrueng were the product of temporary relationships with \\"rented wives\\", or prostitutes, a fact that led to some discrimination in that era. Some Thais were also hostile because of the perceived lack of racial purity, but most were quite accepting. Like certain other parts of Asia, luk khrueng have become popular in the entertainment and modelling industries and many have carved out prominent roles in the entertainment industry with their mixed Caucasian and Thai features which are deemed attractive in modern Thai culture. Vietnam In the last official census in French Indochina in 1946, there were 45,000 Europeans in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia ‚Äì of which one-fifth were Eurasian.Thomas A. Bass. Vietnamerica: The War Comes Home. New York: Soho Press, 1996, p. 86 Much of the business conducted with foreign men in Southeast Asia was done by the local women, who served engaged in both sexual and mercantile intercourse with foreign male traders. A Portuguese and Malay speaking Vietnamese woman who lived in Macau for an extensive period of time was the person who interpreted for the first diplomatic meeting between Cochin-China and a Dutch delegation. She served as an interpreter for three decades in the Cochin-China court with an old woman who had been married to three husbands; one Vietnamese and two Portuguese. The cosmopolitan exchange was facilitated by the marriage of Vietnamese women to Portuguese merchants. Those Vietnamese woman were married to Portuguese men and lived in Macao which was how they became fluent in Malay and Portuguese. Alexander Hamilton said that \\"The Tonquiners used to be very desirous of having a brood of Europeans in their country, for which reason the greatest nobles thought it no shame or disgrace to marry their daughters to English and Dutch seamen, for the time they were to stay in Tonquin, and often presented their sons-in-law pretty handsomely at their departure, especially if they left their wives with child; but adultery was dangerous to the husband, for they are well versed in the art of poisoning.\\" Vietnam saw a surge in its Eurasian population following the entry of the United States as an active combatant in the Vietnam War in 1965. Large numbers of white American soldiers were deployed in South Vietnam to support the country, and intermingling with local Vietnamese women was common. The resulting Eurasian children, known as Amerasians, were products of varying circumstances ranging from genuine long-term relationships and love affairs to prostitution and rape. When the war was going against South Vietnam in the early 1970s, the gradual withdrawal of American troops during the Vietnamization process included many Vietnamese war brides and their Eurasian children. The situation led the United States Congress to enact the American Homecoming Act, granting preferential immigration status specifically to Eurasian children born to servicemen in Vietnam claimed by their fathers. The Eurasian children that remained in Vietnam, around 20,000, were typically from the worst circumstances, fatherless, and often ended up in orphanages as their mothers were incapable or uninterested in raising them. The North Vietnamese victory in 1975 saw greater stigma against Eurasian Vietnamese children, as the new government of reunified Vietnam was hostile to the United States and saw them as symbols of foreign occupation. The poor circumstances of the Amerasian children made them vulnerable to severe social and state-sponsored persecution. =East Asia= Hong Kong File:Sir Robert Ho Tung.jpgRobert Hotung File:Nancy_Kwan_-_1971.jpgNancy Kwan File:Stanleyho2006.jpgStanley Ho File:AnthonyWong08TIFF.jpgAnthony Wong File:Angelababy in 2014 crop2.jpgAngelababy In 19th century Hong Kong, Eurasian or \\"half-caste\\" children were often stigmatised as symbols of 'moral degradation' and 'racial impurity' by both European and Chinese communities. According to Chiu: > To the European community, such children were the ‚Äòtangible evidence of > moral irregularity‚Äô, while to the Chinese community they embodied the shame > and ‚Äòevil‚Äô of their marginalised mothers. Stewart has commented that, ‚ÄòThe > word \\"barbarian\\" on the lip of a Greek contained but an iota of the contempt > which the Chinese entertain for such persons‚Äô. In the 1890s Ernst Johann Eitel, a German missionary, controversially claimed that most \\"half-caste\\" people in Hong Kong were descended exclusively from Europeans having relationships with outcast groups such as the Tanka people. Carl Smith's study in the 1960s on \\"protected women\\" (the kept mistresses of foreigners) to an extent supports Eitel's theory. The Tanka were marginalised in Chinese society which consisted of the majority Puntis (Cantonese-speaking people). Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka- speaking populations and they had limited opportunities of settlement on land. Consequently, the Tanka did not experience the same social pressures when dealing with Europeans. Eitel's theory, however, was criticised by Henry J. Lethbridge writing in the 1970s as a \\"myth\\" propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community. Andrew and Bushnell (2006) wrote extensively on the position of women in the British Empire and the Tanka inhabitants of Hong Kong and their position in the prostitution industry, catering towards foreign sailors. The Tanka did not marry with the Chinese; being descendants of the natives, they were restricted to the waterways. They supplied their women as prostitutes to British sailors and assisted the British in their military actions around Hong Kong. The Tanka in Hong Kong were considered \\"outcasts\\" categorised low class. Ordinary Chinese prostitutes were afraid of serving Westerners since they looked strange to them, while the Tanka prostitutes freely mingled with western men. The Tanka assisted the Europeans with supplies and providing them with prostitutes. Low class European men in Hong Kong easily formed relations with the Tanka prostitutes. The profession of prostitution among the Tanka women led to them being hated by the Chinese both because they had sex with westerners and them being racially Tanka. Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew (1845‚Äì1917) and Katharine Caroline Bushnell (1856‚Äì1946) wrote extensively about the position of women in the British Empire. Published in 1907, Heathen Slaves and Christian Rulers, which examined the exploitation of Chinese women in Hong Kong under colonial rule, discussed the Tanka inhabitants of Hong Kong and their position in the prostitution industry, catering towards foreign sailors. The Tanka did not marry with the Chinese, being descendants of the natives, they were restricted to the waterways. They supplied their women as prostitutes to British sailors and assisted the British in their military actions around Hong Kong. The Tanka in Hong Kong were considered as \\"outcasts\\". Tanka women were ostracized from the Cantonese community, and were nicknamed \\"salt water girls\\" (ham shui mui) for their services as prostitutes to foreigners in Hong Kong. Notable examples of Eurasian people from Hong Kong include Nancy Kwan, once a Hollywood sex symbol, born to a Cantonese father and English and Scottish mother, Bruce Lee, a martial artist icon born to a Cantonese father and a Eurasian mother, and Macao-born actress Isabella Leong, born to a Portuguese-English father and a Chinese mother. The Jewish Dutch man Charles Maurice Bosman was the father of the brothers Sir Robert Hotung and Ho Fook who was the grandfather of Stanley Ho. The number of people who identified as \\"Mixed with one Chinese parent\\" according to the 2001 Hong Kong Census was 16,587, which had risen to 24,649 in 2011. Macau The early Macanese ethnic group was formed from Portuguese men with Malay, Japanese, Indian and Sinhalese women. The Portuguese encouraged Cantonese migration to Macau, and most Macanese in Macau were formed from between Portuguese and Cantonese. In 1810, the total population of Macau was about 4033, of which 1172 were white men, 1830 were white women, 425 male slaves, and 606 female slaves. In 1830, the population increased to 4480 and the breakdown was 1,202 white men, 2149 white women, 350 male slaves and 779 female slaves. There is reason to speculate that large numbers of white women were involved in some forms of prostitution which would probably explain the abnormality in the ratio between men and women among the white population. Majority of the early Cantonese-Portuguese intermarriages were between Portuguese men and women of Tanka origin, who were considered the lowest class of people in China and had relations with Portuguese settlers and sailors, or low class Chinese women.Between China and Europe: person, culture and emotion in Macao, By Jo√£o de Pina-Cabral, page 164 Western men like the Portuguese were refused by high class Cantonese women, who did not marry foreigners. While a minority were Cantonese men and Portuguese women. Macanese men and women also married with the Portuguese and Cantonese, as a result, some Macanese became indistinguishable from the Cantonese or Portuguese population. Because the majority of the population who migrated to Macau were Cantonese, Macau became a culturally Cantonese-speaking society, other ethnic groups became fluent in Cantonese. Most Macanese had paternal Portuguese heritage until 1974. It was in 1980s that Macanese and Portuguese women began to marry men who defined themselves ethnically as Chinese, which resulted in many Macanese with Cantonese paternal ancestry. Many Chinese became Macanese simply by converting to Catholicism, and had no ancestry from the Portuguese, having assimilated into the Macanese people since they were rejected by non Christian Chinese. After the handover of Macau to China in 1999 many Macanese migrated to other countries. Of the Portuguese and Macanese women who stayed in Macau married with local Cantonese men, resulting in more Macanese with Cantonese paternal heritage. There are between 25,000‚Äì46,000 Macanese; 5,000‚Äì8,000 of whom live in Macau, while most live in Latin America (most particularly Brazil), America, and Portugal. Unlike the Macanese of Macau who are strictly of Chinese and Portuguese heritage, many Macanese living abroad are not entirely of Portuguese and Chinese ancestry; many Macanese men and women intermarried with the local population of America and Latin America etc. and have only partial Macanese heritage. Taiwan During the Siege of Fort Zeelandia in which Chinese Ming loyalist forces commanded by Koxinga besieged and defeated the Dutch East India Company and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and children prisoner. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine, and Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their wives. In 1684 some of these Dutch wives were still captives of the Chinese.

South Korea U.S. military personnel married 6423 Korean women as war brides during and immediately after the Korean War.

Collectively, in the Burmese language, Eurasians are specifically known as bo kabya; the term kabya refers to persons of mixed ancestry or dual ethnicity. India Mughal princess Bibi Faiz Bakhsh, c. 1785. The Indian actress Katrina Kaif is the daughter of an Indian father and a British (English) mother. The first use of the term Anglo-Indian referred to all British people living in India, regardless of whether they had Indian ancestors or not. The meaning changed to include only people who were of the very specific lineage descending from the British on the male side and women from the Indian side.Stark, Herbert Alick. Hostages To India: OR The Life Story of the Anglo Indian Race. Third Edition. London: The Simon Wallenberg Press: Vol 2: Anglo Indian Heritage Books People of mixed British and Indian descent were previously referred to as simply 'Eurasians'. During the British East India Company's rule in India in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, it was initially fairly common for British officers and soldiers to take local Indian wives and have Eurasian children. Many European women were barred from being with native men. Even so, there were still many Indian sepoy men who took European wives. Interracial marriages between European men and Indian women were very common during early colonial times. The scholar Michael Fisher estimates that one in three European men during the company rule had Indian wives. The Europeans (mostly Portuguese, Dutch, French, German, Irish, Scottish, and English) were stationed in India in their youth, and looked for relationships with local women. The most famous of such interracial liaisons was between the Hyderabadi noblewoman Khair-un-Nissa and the Scottish resident James Achilles Kirkpatrick. In addition to intermarriage, inter-ethnic prostitution in India existed. Generally, Muslim women did not marry European men because the men were not of the Islamic faith. By the mid-nineteenth century, there were around 40,000 British soldiers but fewer than 2000 British officials present in India. As British women began arriving to India in large numbers around the early-to-mid-nineteenth century, mostly as family members of British officers and soldiers, intermarriage with Indians became less frequent among the British in India. After the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, such intermarriage was considered undesirable by both cultures. The colonial government passed several anti-miscegenation laws. As a result, Eurasians became more marginal to both the British and Indian populations in India. Over generations, Anglo-Indians intermarried with other Anglo-Indians to form a community that developed a culture of its own. They created distinctive Anglo-Indian, dress, speech and religion. They established a school system focused on English language and culture, and formed social clubs and associations to run functions, such as regular dances, at holidays such as Christmas and Easter. Over time, the British colonial government recruited Anglo-Indians into the Customs and Excise, Post and Telegraphs, Forestry Department, the Railways and teaching professions, but they were employed in many other fields as well. A number of factors fostered a strong sense of community among Anglo-Indians. Their English-language school system, their Anglocentric culture, and their Christian beliefs helped bind them together.Maher, James, Reginald. (2007). These Are The Anglo Indians, London: Simon Wallenberg Press. (An Anglo Indian Heritage Book) Today, an estimated 300,000-1 million Anglo-Indians live in India. Sri Lanka File:JacquelineFernandez.jpgSri Lankan actress, Jacqueline Fernandez File:Sachini Ayendra.jpgSri Lankan actress and model, Sachini Ayendra Stanley Due to prolonged colonial contact with Portugal, the Netherlands and Britain, Sri Lanka has had a long history of intermarriage between locals and colonists. Originally these people were known as Mesti√ßos, literally \\"mixed people\\" in Portuguese; today they are collectively classified as Burghers. The Sri Lankan Civil War prompted numerous Burghers to flee the island. Most of them settled in Europe, the Americas, Australia and New Zealand. Portuguese Burghers are usually descended from a Sri Lankan mother and a Portuguese father. This configuration is also the case with the Dutch Burghers. When the Portuguese arrived on the island in 1505, they were accompanied by African slaves. Kaffirs are a mix of African, Portuguese colonist and Sri Lankan. The free mixing between the various groups of people was encouraged by the colonials. Soon the Mesti√ßos or the \\"Mixed People\\" began speaking a creole known as the Ceylonese-Portuguese Creole. It was based on Portuguese, Sinhalese and Tamil. The Burgher population numbers 40,000 in Sri Lanka and thousands more worldwide, concentrated mostly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Phenotypically Burghers can have skin ranging from light to darker, depending on their ancestors, even within the same family. Burghers with dark to light brown skin usually are of Portuguese Burghers or Kaffir ancestry; they may also have European facial features common to the Mediterranean basin (see Mediterraneans). They have a distinct look compared to native Sri Lankans. Most light-skinned Burghers are of Dutch or British descent. Most Burghers are Roman Catholic in religion. Like certain other Asian countries -Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines- Eurasians/Burghers have also been sought after by advertisers and modelling agencies in Sri Lanka. Their mixed look combining both Western and Sri Lankan features makes them attractive to advertisers who see them as a representation of an \\"exotic Sri Lankan/Sinhalese\\". Predictions within the advertising industry in Sri Lanka estimate that more than 50% of advertising models in Sri Lanka are Burghers/Eurasians. =Europe= File:Public Eye Awards 2008 mit Melanie Winiger - Crop (2).jpgMelanie Winiger File:Youri Djorkaeff 2011.jpgYouri Djorkaeff File:Graf Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi (1894‚Äì1972) ~1930.jpgRichard von Coudenhove-Kalergi File:OT Berlin 09-13 Marcel Nguyen.jpgMarcel Nguyen File:France Nuyen.jpgFrance Nuyen File:B√©r√©nice Marlohe 2, 2012.jpgB√©r√©nice Marlohe File:Florence Faivre at 2015 Fan Expo Canada.jpgFlorence Faivre Immigration to Europe has led to the rise of Eurasian communities in Europe, most prominently in the Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom, where significant numbers of Indonesian, Filipino, and Indo-Pakistani Eurasians live. The Turkish Empire spanned large parts of Europe and gave rise to populations with mixed ancestry in their former territories. Netherlands Dutch Eurasians of part Indonesian descent, also called Indos or Indo-Europeans, have largely assimilated in the Netherlands arriving in the Netherlands following the end of World War II until 1965, their diaspora a result of Indonesia gaining its independence from Dutch colonial rule. Statistics show high inter marriage rates with native Dutch (50‚Äì80%). With over 500,000 persons, they are the largest ethnic minority in the Netherlands. So-called Indo rockers such as the Tielman Brothers introduced their blend of rock and roll music to Dutch audiences, whereas others gained fame as singers and TV presenters, such as Rob de Nijs and Sandra Reemer. There are also famous Indo soccer players such as Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Robin van Persie. Well-known politicians, such as Christian democrat Hans van den Broek and politician Geert Wilders, are also of Indo descent. Spain Spanish Eurasians, called Mestizos, most of whom are of partial Filipino ancestry, make up a small but important minority in Spain. Numbering about 115,000, they consist of early migrants to Spain after the loss of the Philippines to the United States in 1898. Well known Spanish Eurasians include actress and socialite Isabel Preysler and her son Enrique Iglesias, as well as former Prime Minister Marcelo Azcarraga Palmero.

Most married and cohabited with local white British women and girls, due to the absence of Indian women in Britain at the time. This later became an issue, as a magistrate of the London Tower Hamlets area in 1817 expressed disgust at how the local British women and girls in the area were marrying and cohabiting with foreign South Asian lascars. Nevertheless, there were no legal restrictions against 'mixed' marriages in Britain, unlike the restrictions in India. This led to \\"mixed race\\" Eurasian (Anglo-Indian) children in Britain, which challenged the British elite efforts to \\"define them using simple dichotomies of British versus Indian, ruler versus ruled.\\" By the mid-nineteenth century, there were more than 40,000 Indian seamen, diplomats, scholars, soldiers, officials, tourists, businessmen and students arriving in Britain, and by the time World War I began, there were 51,616 Indian lascar seamen residing in Britain. In addition, the British officers and soldiers who had Indian wives and Eurasian children in British India often brought them to Britain in the nineteenth century. Following World War I, there were more women than men in Britain, and there were increasing numbers of seamen arriving from abroad, mostly from the Indian subcontinent, in addition to smaller numbers from Yemen, Malaysia and China. This led to increased intermarriage and cohabitation with local white females. Some residents grew concerned about miscegenation and there were several race riots at the time. In the 1920s to 1940s, several writers raised concerns about an increasing 'mixed-breed' population, born mainly from Muslim Asian (mostly South Asian in addition to Arab and Malaysian) fathers and local white mothers, occasionally out of wedlock. They denounced white girls who mixed with Muslim Asian men as 'shameless' and called for a ban on the breeding of 'half-caste' children. Such attempts at imposing anti-miscegenation laws were unsuccessful. As South Asian women began arriving in Britain in large numbers from the 1970s, mostly as family members, intermarriage rates have decreased in the British Asian community, although the size of the community has increased. As of 2006, there are 246,400 'British Mixed-Race' people of European and South Asian descent. There is also a small Eurasian community in Liverpool. The first Chinese settlers were mainly Cantonese from south China some were also from Shanghai. The figures of Chinese for 1921 are 2157 men and 262 women. Many Chinese men married British women while others remained single, possibly supporting a wife and family back home in China. During World War II (1939‚Äì1945) another wave of Chinese seamen from Shanghai and of Cantonese origin married British women. Records show that about some 300 of these men had married British women and supported families. =North America= File:Kristin Kreuk by Gage Skidmore 3.jpgKristin Kreuk File:Keanu Reeves (25448963336) (2).jpgKeanu Reeves File:2011 MuchMusic Video Awards - Shay Mitchell (PLL) (cropped).jpgShay Mitchell File:George Nozuka.jpgGeorge Nozuka File:Justin Nozuka by Guillaume Laurent.jpgJustin Nozuka Canada Cuba There were almost no women among the nearly entirely male Chinese coolie population that migrated to Cuba. In Cuba some Indian (Native American), mulatto, black, and white women engaged in carnal relations or marriages with Chinese men, with marriages of mulatto, black, and white woman being reported by the Cuba Commission Report. 120,000 Cantonese 'coolies' (all males) entered Cuba under contract for 80 years. Most of these men did not marry, but Hung Hui (1975:80) cites there was a frequency of sexual activity between black women and these Asian immigrants. According to Osberg (1965:69) the free Chinese practice of buying slave women and then freeing them expressly for marriage was utilized at length. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Chinese men (Cantonese) engaged in sexual activity with white Cuban women and black Cuban women, and from such relations many children were born. (For a British Caribbean model of Chinese cultural retention through procreation with black women, see Patterson, 322-31). In the 1920s an additional 30,000 Cantonese and small groups of Japanese also arrived; both immigrant groups were exclusively male, and there was rapid intermarriage with white, black, and mulato populations. CIA World Factbook. Cuba. 2008. 15 May 2008. claimed 114,240 Chinese-Cuban coolies with only 300 pure Chinese. In the study of genetic origin, admixture, and asymmetry in maternal and paternal human lineages in Cuba. Thirty-five Y-chromosome SNPs were typed in the 132 male individuals of the Cuban sample. The study does not include any people with some Chinese ancestry. All the samples were white Cubans and black Cubans. Two out of 132 male sample belong to East Asian Haplogroup O2 which is found in significant frequencies among Cantonese people is found in 1.5% of Cuban population. Costa Rica The Chinese originated from the Cantonese male migrants. Pure Chinese make up only 1% of the Costa Rican population but according to Jacqueline M. Newman close to 10% of Costa Ricans are of Chinese descent or married to a Chinese. Most Chinese immigrants since then have been Cantonese, but in the last decades of the twentieth century, a number of immigrants have also come from Taiwan. Many men came alone to work and married Costa Rican women and speak Cantonese. However the majority of the descendants of the first Chinese immigrants no longer speak Cantonese and feel themselves to be Costa Ricans. They married Tican women (who are a blend of Europeans, Castizos, Mestizos, Indian, black). A Tican is also a white person with a small portion of nonwhite blood like Castizos. The census In 1989 shows about 98% of Costa Ricans were either white, castizos, mestizos, with 80% being white or Castizos. Mexico A marriage between a Chinese man and a white Mexican woman was recorded in \\"Current anthropological literature, Volumes 1‚Äì2\\", published in 1912, titled \\"Note on two children born to a Chinese and a Mexican white\\"- \\"Note sur deux enfants nes d'un chinois et d une mexicaine de race blanche. (Ibid., 122‚Äì125, portr.) Treats briefly of Chen Tean (of Hong Kong), his wife, Inez Mancha (a white Mexican), married in 1907, and their children, a boy (b. April 14, 1908) and a girl (b. Sept. 24, 1909). The boy is of marked Chinese type, the girl much more European. No Mongolian spots were noticed at birth. Both children were born with red cheeks. Neither has ever been sick. The boy began to walk at ten months, the girl a little after a year.\\" Mexican women and Chinese men initiated free unions with each other as recorded by the Chihuahua and Sonora census records, a number Chinese men and their Mexican wives and children came to China to live there while a big number of Chinese-Mexican families were entirely expelled from northern Mexico to China, during the early 1930s 500 Chinese-Mexican families, numbering around 2,000 people in total came to China, with a large number of them settling in Portuguese Macau and forming their own ghetto there since they were drawn to the Catholic and Iberian culture of Macau. A lot of couples ended up divorcing in China due to a huge variety of factors which caused stress like culture, economic, and familial with the men leaving Macau with hundreds of Mexican women and mixed children alone. Mexican women in Macau rearing their mixed Chinese children wanted to return to Mexico saying \\"Even if we have to scrape bittersweet potatoes in the sierra, we want Mexico.\\" and Mexico under President L√°zaro Cardenas allowed over 400 Mexican women and their children to come back in 1937‚Äì1938 after the women petitioned, after World War II, some Chinese Mexican families also came back and after a petition by mixed race Chinese-Mexicans who had been deported from Mexico and raised in Macau led another campaign to allow them to return home in 1960. Children which were born to Mexican women and sired by Chinese men were counted as ethnic Chinese by Mexican census takers since they were not considered Mexicans by the general public and viewed as Chinese. The Mexican ideology of mestizaje portrayed the quintessential Mexican identity as being made from a mix of indigenous native and Spanish white, with Mexico being portrayed by racial ideologues as being made out of a south populated by indigenous natives, a central part populated by mixed white-native Mestizos, and a north populated by white Spanish creoles, Sonora was where these white Spanish creoles lived, and the marriage of Chinese with Mexicans was portrayed as particularly threatening to the white identity of Sonora and to the concept of mixed mestizaje identity of indigenous natives and Spanish since the Chinese-Mexican mixed children did not fit into this identity. The anti- Chinese campaigns resulted in an exodus of Chinese leaving northern Mexican states like Sonora, Sinaloa, Coahuila, Chihuahua and Mexicali, with the Chinese and their families being stripped of the property they took with them as they were forced across the Mexican border into America, where they would be sent back to China, Dr. David Trembly MacDougal said \\"many of these departing Chinese have married Mexican women, some of whom with their children accompany them into exile.\\", and after \\"a lifetime of skillful and honest work\\" they were driven into poverty by the loss of their property. Mexico's international image was being damaged by the anti-Chinese expulsion campaign and while attempts were made to reign in anti-Chinese measures by the Mexican federal government, using the war between Japan and China as a reason to stop deporting Chinese, Mexican states continued in the anti-Chinese campaign to drive Chinese out of states like Sinora and Sinaloa with citizenship being stripped from Mexican women who were married to Chinese men, labeled as \\"race traitors\\" and from the United States, Sinaloa, and Sonora, both Mexican women, their Chinese husbands and their mixed children were expelled to China There was a more widespread general anti-foreign sentiment sweeping through Mexico which was against Arabs, eastern Europeans, and Jews, in addition to Chinese, with the anti-Chinese movement being part of this bigger campaign, a Mexican anti-foreign pamphlet exhorted Mexicans to \\"not spend one penny on the Chinese, Russians, Poles, Czechoslovacs, Lithuanians, Greeks, Jews, Sirio- Lebanese, etc.\\" a poster advocated \\"boycott sabotage, and expulsion from the country of all foreigners in general, considered as pernicious and undesirable.\\" and warned against Chinese men marrying Mexican women, saying \\"WHATEVER IT COSTS, MEXICAN WOMAN! Do not fall asleep, help your racial brothers boycott the undesirable foreigners, who steal the bread from our children.\\" Many Chinese migrated into Sinaloa and into cities such as Mazatl√°n up to the 1920s where they engaged in business and married Mexican women, this led to the expulsion of Chinese in the 1930s and Sinaloa passed laws expelling the Chinese in 1933, leading to the break up of mixed Chinese Mexican families and Mexican women to be deported to China with their Chinese husbands. After several hundred Chinese men and their mixed families of Mexican wives and Mexican Chinese children were expelled from Mexico into the United States, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) took charge of these people, took their testimonies and labelled them as refugees before sending them to China, the U.S. immigration employees also included under the category \\"Chinese refugees from Mexico\\", the Mexican women and mixed Chinese Mexican children who accompanied the Chinese men and sent them all to China instead of sending the mixed children and Mexican women to Mexico in spite of it having been cheaper, since at this era of history laws and convention regarding citizenship held that women were controlled by their husbands and when they married foreign men, women had their citizenship stripped from them so the women were dealt with by their husbands' standing and conditions so while Chinese men had their testimonies collected, the Mexican women were not interviewed by U.S. immigration officials, and the Mexican women and the mixed Chinese Mexican families were sent to China, even Mexican women who were not officially married but were engaged in relationships with Chinese men. Sinaloa and Sonora saw most of their Chinese population and mixed Chinese Mexican families deported due to the virulent anti-Chinese movement. The anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico was spurred on by the onset of the Great Depression, Chinese started to come to Mexico in the late 19th century and the majority of them were in trade and owners of businesses when the Maderistas came into power, marrying Mexican women and siring mixed race children with them which resulted in a law banning Chinese-Mexican marriages in 1923 in Sonora and another law forcing Chinese into ghettos two years after, and in Sinaloa, Sonora, and Chihuahua, the Chinese were driven out in the early 1930s with northern Mexico seeing 11,000 Chinese expelled in total. The maternal grandfather of Mexican singer Ana Gabriel was a Chinese man named Yang Quing Yong Chizon who adopted the name Roberto in Mexico.

Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations, the largest part-European bi-racial population is European/Native American and Alaskan Native, at 7,015,017; followed by European/African at 737,492; then European/Asian at 727,197; and finally European/Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander at 125,628. The U.S. Census has categorized Eurasian responses in the \\"Some other race\\" section as belonging to the Asian category. The Eurasian responses the US Census officially recognizes are Indo-European, Amerasian, and Eurasian. Starting with the 2000 Census, people have been allowed to mark more than one \\"race\\" on the U.S. census, and many have identified as both Asian and European. Defining Eurasians as those who were marked as both \\"white\\" and \\"Asian\\" in the census, there were 868,395 Eurasians in the United States in 2000 and 1,623,234 in 2010. Accusations of support for miscegenation were commonly made by slavery defenders against abolitionists before the US Civil War. After the War, similar charges were used by white segregationists against advocates of equal rights for African Americans. They were said to be secretly plotting the destruction of the white race through miscegenation. In the 1950s, segregationists alleged a Communist plot funded by the Soviet Union with that goal. In 1957, segregationists cite the antisemitic hoax A Racial Program for the Twentieth Century as evidence for these claims. From the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, the Chinese who migrated to the United States were almost entirely of Cantonese origin. Anti-miscegenation laws in many states prohibited Chinese men from marrying white women. In the mid-1850s, 70 to 150 Chinese were living in New York City, and 11 of them married Irish women. In 1906 the New York Times (6 August) reported that 300 white women (Irish American) were married to Chinese men in New York, with many more cohabited. In 1900, based on Liang research, of the 120,000 men in more than 20 Chinese communities in the United States, he estimated that one out of every 20 Chinese men (Cantonese) was married to white women. In the 1960s census showed 3500 Chinese men married to white women and 2900 Chinese women married to white men. Twenty-five percent of married Asian American women have white spouses, but 45% of cohabitating Asian American women are with white American men. Of cohabiting Asian men, slightly over 37% of Asian men have white female partners and over 10% married to white women.Degrading Stereotypes Ruin Dating Experience . Modelminority.com (22 October 2002). Retrieved 11 December 2011. Asian American women and Asian American men live with a white partner, 40% and 27%, respectively (Le, 2006b). In 2008, of new marriages including an Asian man, 80% were to an Asian spouse and 14% to a white spouse; of new marriages involving an Asian woman, 61% were to an Asian spouse and 31% to a white spouse. =Hawaii= Brook Lee The majority of early Hawaiian Chinese were Cantonese-speaking migrants from Guangdong, with a small number of Hakka speakers. If all people with Chinese ancestry in Hawaii (including the Sino- Hawaiians) are included, they form about one-third of Hawaii's entire population. Many thousands of them married women of Hawaiian, Hawaiian/European and European origin. A large percentage of the Chinese men married Hawaiian and Hawaiian European women. While a minority married white women in Hawaii were with Portuguese women. The 12,592 Asiatic Hawaiians enumerated in 1930 were the result of Chinese men intermarrying with Hawaiian and part Hawaiian European. Most Asiatic Hawaiians men also married Hawaiians and European women (and vice versa). On the census some Chinese with little native blood would be classified as Chinese not an Asiatic Hawaiians due to dilution of native blood. Intermarriage started to decline in the 1920s. Portuguese and other Caucasian women married Chinese men. These unions between Chinese men and Portuguese women resulted in children of mixed Chinese Portuguese parentage, called Chinese-Portuguese. For two years to 30 June 1933, 38 of these children were born, they were classified as pure Chinese because their fathers were Chinese. A large amount of mingling took place between Chinese and Portuguese, Chinese men married Portuguese, Spanish, Hawaiian, Caucasian-Hawaiian, etc. Only one Chinese man was recorded marrying an American woman. Chinese men in Hawaii also married Puerto Rican, Portuguese, Japanese, Greek, and half-white women. =Oceania= Australia Billy Sing Bob Morley Most of the early Australian Chinese population consisted of Cantonese-speaking migrants from Guangzhou and Taishan as well as some Hokkien-speaking from Fujian. They migrated to Australia during the gold rush period of the 1850s. Marriage records show that between the 1850s and the start of the twentieth century, there were about 2000 legal marriages between white women and migrant Chinese men in Australia's eastern colonies, probably with similar numbers involved in de facto relationships of various kinds. A Chinese man Sun San Lung and his son by his white European Australian wife Lizzie in Castlemaine returned to China in 1887 for a trip after marrying a second white wife after Lizzie died, but they were blocked from coming back to Melbourne. Chinese men were found living with 73 opium addicted Australian white women when Quong Tart surveyed the goldfields for opium addicts, and many homeless women abused by husbands and prostitutes ran away and married Chinese men in Sydney after taking refuge in Chinese opium dens in gambling houses, Reverend Francis Hopkins said that \\"A Chinaman's Anglo-Saxon wife is almost his God, a European's is his slave. This is the reason why so many girls transfer their affections to the almond-eyed Celestials.\\" when giving the reason why these women married Chinese men. After the gold mining ended some Chinese remained in Australia and started families, one youthful Englishwoman married a Chinese in 1870 in Bendigo and the Golden Dragon Museum is run by his great-grandson Russell Jack. The Australian sniper Billy Sing was the son of a Chinese father and an English mother.Gallipoli and the Anzacs: The Anzac Walk ‚Äì Artillery Road (2009).

The rate of intermarriage declined as stories of the viciousness of Chinese men towards white women spread, mixed with increasing opposition to intermarriage. Rallies against Chinese men taking white women as wives became widespread as many white Australian men saw the intermarriage and cohabitation of Chinese men with white women as a threat to the white race. In late 1878, there were 181 marriages between women of European descent and Chinese men as well as 171 such couples cohabiting without matrimony, resulting in the birth of 586 children of Sino-European descent. Such a rate of intermarriage between Chinese Australians and white Australians was to continue until the 1930s. =South America= Argentina Today, there are an estimated of 180,000 Asian-Argentines, with 120,000 of Chinese descent, 32,000 of Japanese descent, 25,000 of Korean descent.

In Brazil, home to the largest Japanese community overseas, miscegenation is celebrated, and it promoted racial integration and mixing over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, nevertheless as a way of dealing with and assimilating its non-white population, submitted to white elites, with no dangers of uprisings that would put its status quo in risk. While culture shock was strong for the first and second generations of Japanese Brazilians, and the living conditions in the fazendas (plantation farms) after the slavery crisis were sometimes worse than in Asia, Brazil stimulated immigration as means of substitution for the lost workforce, and any qualms about the non-whiteness of the Japanese were quickly forgotten. After Japan became one of the world's most developed and rich nations, the Japanese in Brazil and their culture as well gained an image of progress, instead of the old bad perception of a people which would not be assimilated or integrated as its culture and race were deemed as diametrically opposed to the Brazilian ones. In the censuses, self-reported amarelos (literally \\"yellows\\" i.e. Mongolics, people racially Asian) include about 2,100,000 people, or around 1% of the Brazilian population. A greater number of persons may have Japanese and less commonly Chinese and Korean ancestry, but identify as white (Brazilian society has no one drop rule), pardo (i.e. brown-skinned multiracial or assimilated Amerindian, pardo stands for a Brazilian darker than white and lighter than black, but not necessarily implying a white-black admixture) or Afro-Brazilian. When it comes to religion, self-reported Asian Brazilians are only less Irreligious than whites, and a little more Catholic than Amerindians. They are the least group when it comes to traditional churches of Christianity, and also the least group in percent of Protestants, and Evangelicals or Pentecostals as well. Asian Brazilians have the highest income per capita according to the 2010 census. Peru About 100,000 Cantonese coolies (almost all males) in 1849 to 1874 migrated to Peru and intermarried with Peruvian women of mestizo, European, Amerindian, European/mestizo, African and mulatto origin. Many Peruvian Chinese and Peruvian Japanese today are of Spanish, Italian, African and American origin. Estimates for Chinese-Peruvian is about 1.3‚Äì1.6 millions. Asian Peruvians are estimated to be 3% of the population, but one source places the number of citizens with some Chinese ancestry at 4.2 million, which equates to 15% of the country's total population. In Peru, non-Chinese women married the mostly male Chinese coolies.

All electrical networks can be analyzed as multiple electrical elements interconnected by wires. Where the elements roughly correspond to real components, the representation can be in the form of a schematic diagram or circuit diagram. This is called a lumped-element circuit model. In other cases, infinitesimal elements are used to model the network, in a distributed-element model. These ideal electrical elements represent real, physical electrical or electronic components but they do not exist physically and they are assumed to have ideal properties, while actual electrical components have less than ideal properties, a degree of uncertainty in their values and some degree of nonlinearity. To model the nonideal behavior of a real circuit component may require a combination of multiple ideal electrical elements in order to approximate its function. For example, an inductor circuit element is assumed to have inductance but no resistance or capacitance, while a real inductor, a coil of wire, has some resistance in addition to its inductance. This may be modeled by an ideal inductance element in series with a resistance. Circuit analysis using electric elements is useful for understanding many practical electrical networks using components. By analyzing the way a network is affected by its individual elements it is possible to estimate how a real network will behave. Types Circuit elements can be classified into different categories. One is how many terminals they have to connect them to other components: *One-port elementsthese represent the simplest components, that have only two terminals to connect to. Examples are resistances, capacitances, inductances, and diodes. *Multiport elementsthese have more than two terminals. They connect to the external circuit through multiple pairs of terminals called ports. For example, a transformer with three separate windings has six terminals and could be idealized as a three-port element; the ends of each winding are connected to a pair of terminals which represent a port. **Two-port elementsthese are the most common multiport elements, which have four terminals consisting of two ports. Elements can also be divided into active and passive: *Active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power; examples are voltage sources and current sources. They can be used to represent ideal batteries and power supplies. **Dependent sourcesThese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals. These are used in the modelling of amplifying components such as transistors, vacuum tubes, and op-amps. *Passive elementsThese are elements which do not have a source of energy, examples are diodes, resistances, capacitances, and inductances. Another distinction is between linear and nonlinear: *Linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation, the relation between voltage and current, is a linear function. They obey the superposition principle. Examples of linear elements are resistances, capacitances, inductances, and linear dependent sources. Circuits with only linear elements, linear circuits, do not cause intermodulation distortion, and can be easily analysed with powerful mathematical techniques such as the Laplace transform. *Nonlinear elementsthese are elements in which the relation between voltage and current is a nonlinear function. An example is a diode, in which the current is an exponential function of the voltage. Circuits with nonlinear elements are harder to analyse and design, often requiring circuit simulation computer programs such as SPICE. One-port elements Only nine types of element (memristor not included), five passive and four active, are required to model any electrical component or circuit. Each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network: current, I; voltage, V, charge, Q; and magnetic flux, \\\\Phi. * Two sources: **Current source, measured in amperes ‚Äì produces a current in a conductor. Affects charge according to the relation dQ = -I\\\\,dt. **Voltage source, measured in volts ‚Äì produces a potential difference between two points. Affects magnetic flux according to the relation d\\\\Phi = V\\\\,dt. ::\\\\Phi in this relationship does not necessarily represent anything physically meaningful. In the case of the current generator, Q, the time integral of current, represents the quantity of electric charge physically delivered by the generator. Here \\\\Phi is the time integral of voltage but whether or not that represents a physical quantity depends on the nature of the voltage source. For a voltage generated by magnetic induction it is meaningful, but for an electrochemical source, or a voltage that is the output of another circuit, no physical meaning is attached to it. ::Both these elements are necessarily non-linear elements. See #Non- linear elements below. * Three passive elements: **Resistance R, measured in ohms ‚Äì produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element. Relates voltage and current according to the relation dV = R\\\\,dI. **Capacitance C, measured in farads ‚Äì produces a current proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the element. Relates charge and voltage according to the relation dQ = C\\\\,dV. **Inductance L, measured in henries ‚Äì produces the magnetic flux proportional to the rate of change of current through the element. Relates flux and current according to the relation d\\\\Phi = L\\\\,dI. * Four abstract active elements: ** Voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS) Generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain. (has infinite input impedance and zero output impedance). ** Voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) Generates a current based on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit, with respect to a specified gain, used to model field-effect transistors and vacuum tubes (has infinite input impedance and infinite output impedance). The gain is characterised by a transfer conductance which will have units of siemens. ** Current-controlled voltage source (CCVS) Generates a voltage based on an input current elsewhere in the circuit with respect to a specified gain. (has zero input impedance and zero output impedance). Used to model trancitors. The gain is characterised by a transfer impedance which will have units of ohms. ** Current-controlled current source (CCCS) Generates a current based on an input current and a specified gain. Used to model bipolar junction transistors. (Has zero input impedance and infinite output impedance). ::These four elements are examples of two-port elements. =Non-linear elements= Conceptual symmetries of resistor, capacitor, inductor, and memristor. In reality, all circuit components are non-linear and can only be approximated to linear over a certain range. To more exactly describe the passive elements, their constitutive relation is used instead of simple proportionality. From any two of the circuit variables there are six constitutive relations that can be formed. From this it is supposed that there is a theoretical fourth passive element since there are only five elements in total (not including the various dependent sources) found in linear network analysis. This additional element is called memristor. It only has any meaning as a time-dependent non-linear element; as a time-independent linear element it reduces to a regular resistor. Hence, it is not included in linear time-invariant (LTI) circuit models. The constitutive relations of the passive elements are given by;Ljiljana Trajkoviƒá, \\"Nonlinear circuits\\", The Electrical Engineering Handbook (Ed: Wai-Kai Chen), pp.75‚Äì77, Academic Press, 2005 *Resistance: constitutive relation defined as f(V, I)=0. *Capacitance: constitutive relation defined as f(V, Q)=0. *Inductance: constitutive relation defined as f(\\\\Phi, I)=0. *Memristance: constitutive relation defined as f(\\\\Phi, Q)=0. :where f(x,y) is an arbitrary function of two variables. In some special cases the constitutive relation simplifies to a function of one variable. This is the case for all linear elements, but also for example, an ideal diode, which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor, has a constitutive relation of the form V = f(I). Both independent voltage, and independent current sources can be considered non-linear resistors under this definition. The fourth passive element, the memristor, was proposed by Leon Chua in a 1971 paper, but a physical component demonstrating memristance was not created until thirty-seven years later. It was reported on April 30, 2008, that a working memristor had been developed by a team at HP Labs led by scientist R. Stanley Williams.EETimes, 30 April 2008, 'Missing link' memristor created, EETimes, 30 April 2008Engineers find 'missing link' of electronics ‚Äì 30 April 2008Researchers Prove Existence of New Basic Element for Electronic Circuits ‚Äì 'Memristor' ‚Äì 30 April 2008 With the advent of the memristor, each pairing of the four variables can now be related. There are also two special non-linear elements which are sometimes used in analysis but which are not the ideal counterpart of any real component: *Nullator: defined as V = I = 0 *Norator: defined as an element which places no restrictions on voltage and current whatsoever. These are sometimes used in models of components with more than two terminals: transistors for instance. Two-port elements All the above are two-terminal, or one-port, elements with the exception of the dependent sources. There are two lossless, passive, linear two-port elements that are normally introduced into network analysis.  The transformer maps a voltage at one port to a voltage at the other in a ratio of n. The current between the same two port is mapped by 1/n. The gyrator, on the other hand, maps a voltage at one port to a current at the other. Likewise, currents are mapped to voltages. The quantity r in the matrix is in units of resistance. The gyrator is a necessary element in analysis because it is not reciprocal. Networks built from the basic linear elements only are obliged to be reciprocal and so cannot be used by themselves to represent a non-reciprocal system. It is not essential, however, to have both the transformer and gyrator. Two gyrators in cascade are equivalent to a transformer but the transformer is usually retained for convenience. Introduction of the gyrator also makes either capacitance or inductance non- essential since a gyrator terminated with one of these at port 2 will be equivalent to the other at port 1. However, transformer, capacitance and inductance are normally retained in analysis because they are the ideal properties of the basic physical components transformer, inductor and capacitor whereas a practical gyrator must be constructed as an active circuit.Wadhwa, C.L., Network analysis and synthesis, pp.17‚Äì22, New Age International, .Herbert J. Carlin, Pier Paolo Civalleri, Wideband circuit design, pp.171‚Äì172, CRC Press, 1998 .Vjekoslav Damiƒá, John Montgomery, Mechatronics by bond graphs: an object-oriented approach to modelling and simulation, pp.32‚Äì33, Springer, 2003 . Examples The following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements. * On a first degree of approximation, a battery is represented by a voltage source. A more refined model also includes a resistance in series with the voltage source, to represent the battery's internal resistance (which results in the battery heating and the voltage dropping when in use). A current source in parallel may be added to represent its leakage (which discharges the battery over a long period of time). * On a first degree of approximation, a resistor is represented by a resistance. A more refined model also includes a series inductance, to represent the effects of its lead inductance (resistors constructed as a spiral have more significant inductance). A capacitance in parallel may be added to represent the capacitive effect of the proximity of the resistor leads to each other. A wire can be represented as a low-value resistor * Current sources are more often used when representing semiconductors. For example, on a first degree of approximation, a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current.

Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technologyBrian Attebery, The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature, pp. 166‚Äì7, and sometimes, either a historical or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be a parallel world connected to Earth via magical portals or items (like Narnia); an imaginary universe hidden within ours (like Wizarding world); a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future (like Middle-earth); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the Star Wars Galaxy).John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Imaginary lands\\", pp. 495‚Äì5 Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore. Plot function The setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Land\\", p. 558 Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Fantasyland\\", p. 341 Even when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods.Michael Moorcock, Wizardry & Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy pp. 72‚Äì3 History Early fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy lands, part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers. For example, Oz, though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Oz\\", p. 739 Although medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an ogre could live a day's travel away, distant continents were necessary from the Renaissance onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.C. S. Lewis, \\"On Science Fiction\\", Of Other Worlds, p. 68 Even within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900, was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 99, An early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set \\"long ago\\" or \\"far away\\". This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Arabian fantasy\\", p 52 A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright's Islandia. Islandia's remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an arcadian society, are explained by means of a law which allows only limited contact with foreigners. Dream frames were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place.L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p 96, H.P. Lovecraft made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream-settings have been criticized,J.R.R. Tolkien, \\"On Fairy-Stories\\", p. 14, The Tolkien Reader, Ballantine Books, New York 1966 and are far less frequent today. This change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds.Colin Manlove, Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present p 210 This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.Colin Manlove, Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present p. 211‚Äì2 Common elements The most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since William Morris used it in his early fantasy works, such as The Well at the World's End.Diana Waggoner, The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy, p 37, and particularly since the 1954 publication of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Such a world is often called \\"pseudo-medieval\\"‚Äîparticularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on romanticized views of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism.John Grant, \\"Gulliver Unravels: Generic Fantasy and the Loss of Subversion\\" The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or oligarchies, usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages.Alec Austin, \\"Quality in Epic Fantasy\\" Fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy, and disproportionately pastoral.Jane Yolen, \\"Introduction\\" p viii After the King: Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien, ed, Martin H. Greenberg, Careful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place.Philip Martin, The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest, p. 113, Heavy and faithful use of real-world setting for inspiration, as in Barry Hughart's Bridge of Birds, clearly derived from China, or Lloyd Alexander's use of real world cultures such as Welsh for The Chronicles of Prydain or Indian for The Iron Ring, make the line between fantasy worlds and alternate histories fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings pushes a work toward alternative history. Conversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country‚Äîsuch as Ruritania or Graustark‚Äîdoes not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such Ruritanian romances may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of figures such as witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.L. Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, p. 6 According to Lin Carter in Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy, fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of magic (paranormal). This element may be the creatures in it (dragons, unicorns, genies and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from mythology and folklore, frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.Carter, Lin, Imaginary Worlds, the Art of Fantasy. Ballantine, 1973. Constructed worlds Fantasy worlds created through a process called world building are known as a constructed world. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self- consistent the setting of a fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world. Despite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night's stay in an inn that would equate to several years‚Äô income. Furthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards' spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade, or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from Surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. =Examples= *L. Frank Baum created the Land of Oz for his novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its original sequels. He was one of the few authors before Tolkien to use consistent internal geographies and histories to enrich his world. *C. S. Lewis, author of The Chronicles of Narnia, set that series' novels mostly in a magical land called Narnia. Lewis was a colleague of Tolkien, and their fictional worlds share several key elements. *Terry Pratchett created Discworld, a large disc resting on the backs of four huge elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, as it slowly swims through space. *J. R. R. Tolkien created Middle-earth, a famous fantasy world. He introduced several revolutionary concepts to fantasy fiction and popularized the idea of intricately detailed fantasy worlds. He wrote at some length about the process, which he called \\"sub-creation\\". Middle-earth is intended to be Earth's Old World in a fictional ancient era. *George R. R. Martin created a fictional world for his novel series A Song of Ice and Fire. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. Most of the story is set in the western continent of Westeros, though some is set in the Eastern continent Essos. The Southern continent of Sothoryos is also shown on maps, with a possible fourth continent, Ulthos, to its East. A map of the world is shown in the title sequence of the HBO TV adaptation, Game of Thrones. Fairytale and comic fantasy Fairytale fantasy may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully. Comic fantasy may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies' faulty world-building, as in Diana Wynne Jones's Dark Lord of Derkholm, or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in L. Sprague de Camp's Solomon's Stone, where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other subgenres of fantasy suffer if the world- building is neglected.  Retreat of magic  Rather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth's past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce \\"a retreat of magic\\" (sometimes called \\"thinning\\") that explains why the magic and other fantastic elements no longer appear:John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Thinning\\", p. 942 For example, in The Lord of the Rings, the destruction of the One Ring defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the Three Rings of the elves, resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A contemporary fantasy necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. J. K. Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magic creatures and artifacts from non-magic users. Role-playing games Dungeons & Dragons, the first major role-playing game, has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called \\"campaign settings\\"), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The Forgotten Realms is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds. These elements of detail can be a large part of what attracts people to RPGs. Many established fantasy writers have also derided Dungeons and Dragons and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung. Due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and science fiction, it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between \\"fantasy worlds\\" and planets in science fiction. For example, the worlds of Barsoom, Darkover, Gor, and the Witch World combine elements of both genres.

Sailors have always mistaken low clouds for land masses, and in later times this was given the name Dutch capes.Schott's Quintessential Miscellany, p.119, Other fictional lands appear most commonly as settings or subjects of myth, literature, film, or video games. They may also be used for technical reasons in actual reality for use in the development of specifications, such as the fictional country of Bookland, which is used to allow EAN \\"country\\" codes 978 and 979 to be used for ISBN numbers assigned to books, and code 977 to be assigned for use for ISSN numbers on magazines and other periodicals. Also, the ISO 3166 country code \\"ZZ\\" is reserved as a fictional country code,. Fictional countries appear commonly in stories of early science fiction (or scientific romance). Such countries supposedly form part of the normal Earth landscape although not located in a normal atlas. Later similar tales often took place on fictional planets. Jonathan Swift's protagonist, Lemuel Gulliver, visited various strange places. Edgar Rice Burroughs placed adventures of Tarzan in areas in Africa that, at the time, remained mostly unknown to the West and to the East. Isolated islands with strange creatures and/or customs enjoyed great popularity in these authors' times. By the 19th century, when Western explorers had surveyed most of the Earth's surface, this option was lost to Western culture. Thereafter fictional utopian and dystopian societies tended to spring up on other planets or in space, whether in human colonies or in alien societies originating elsewhere. Fictional countries can also be used in stories set in a distant future, with other political borders than today. Superhero and secret agent comics and some thrillers also use fictional countries on Earth as backdrops. Most of these countries exist only for a single story, a TV-series episode or an issue of a comic book. There are notable exceptions where fictional countries appear as recurring plot elements, such as: Qumar and Equatorial Kundu (The West Wing); Latveria (Marvel Comics); and Qurac and Bialya (DC Comics). Purposes Fictional countries often deliberately resemble or even represent some real-world country or present a utopia or dystopia for commentary. Variants of the country's name sometimes make it clear what country they really have in mind. By using a fictional country instead of a real one, authors can exercise greater freedom in creating characters, events, and settings, while at the same time presenting a vaguely familiar locale that readers can recognize. A fictional country leaves the author unburdened by the restraints of a real nation's actual history, politics, and culture, and can thus allow for greater scope in plot construction and be exempt from criticism for vilifying an actual nation, political party, or people. The fictional \\"Tomania\\" (a parody of Nazi Germany named after ptomaine) serves as a setting for Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator and skewers a r√©gime infamous for religious bigotry, militarism, racism, diplomatic bullying, and violations of civil liberties. Charlie Chaplin mocks Adolf Hitler in a setting that ridicules Nazi Germany and its leadership, and uses double-crosses as mockery of the Nazi swastika. Fictional countries are also invented for the purpose of military training scenarios, e.g. the group of islands around Hawaii were assigned the names \\"Blueland\\" and \\"Orangeland\\" in the international maritime exercise, RIMPAC 98. In survey research Fictional countries have been created for polling purposes. When polled in April 2004, 8% of British people believed that the [fictional] country of Luvania would soon join the European Union. In the 1989 General Social Survey, U.S. respondents were asked to rate the social status of people of \\"Wisian\\" background, a fictional national heritage. While a majority of respondents said they could not place the Wisians in the U.S. social hierarchy, those who did ranked their status as quite low, giving an average of 4.12 on a 9-point scale, where 9 was the highest social standing. \\"Once you let the Wisians in, the neighborhood goes to pot,\\" quipped Time Magazine.

This is done to help with tracheal intubation or electroconvulsive therapy. It is given either by injection into a vein or muscle. When used in a vein onset of action is generally within one minute and effects last for up to 10 minutes. Common side effects include low blood pressure, increased saliva production, muscle pain, and rash. Serious side effects include malignant hyperthermia and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people who are at risk of high blood potassium or a history of myopathy. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby. Suxamethonium is in the neuromuscular blocker family of medications and is of the depolarizing type. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on skeletal muscles. Suxamethonium was described as early as 1906 and came into medical use in 1951. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Suxamethonium is available as a generic medication. It may colloquially be referred to as \\"sux\\". Medical uses A vial of suxamethonium chloride Its medical uses are limited to short- term muscle relaxation in anesthesia and intensive care, usually for facilitation of endotracheal intubation. It is popular in emergency medicine due to its rapid onset and brief duration of action. The former is a major point of consideration in the context of trauma care, where endotracheal intubation may need to be completed very quickly. The latter means that, should attempts at endotracheal intubation fail and the person cannot be ventilated, there is a prospect for neuromuscular recovery and the onset of spontaneous breathing before low blood oxygen levels occurs. It may be better than rocuronium in people without contraindications due to its faster onset of action and shorter duration of action. Suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy, favoured for its short duration of action. Suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes. When plasma levels of butyrylcholinesterase are greatly diminished or an atypical form is present (an otherwise harmless inherited disorder), paralysis may last much longer, as is the case in liver failure or in neonates. It is recommended that the vials be stored at a temperature between 2¬∞-8 ¬∞C. The multi-dose vials are stable for up to 14 days at room temperature without significant loss of potency. Unless otherwise indicated in the prescribing information, room temperature for storage of medications is 15¬∞-25 ¬∞C (59¬∞-77 ¬∞F). Side effects Side effects include malignant hyperthermia, muscle pains, acute rhabdomyolysis with high blood levels of potassium, transient ocular hypertension, constipation and changes in cardiac rhythm, including slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. In people with neuromuscular disease or burns, an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles, potentially resulting in cardiac arrest. Conditions having susceptibility to suxamethonium-induced high blood potassium are burns, closed head injury, acidosis, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, cerebral stroke, drowning, severe intra-abdominal sepsis, massive trauma, myopathy, and tetanus. Suxamethonium does not produce unconsciousness or anesthesia, and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate. Therefore, administration of the drug to a conscious patient is contraindicated. =Hyperkalemia= The side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open, allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid. A typical increase of potassium ion serum concentration on administration of suxamethonium is 0.5 mmol per liter. The increase is transient in otherwise healthy patients. The normal range of potassium is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. High blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 mEq per liter. Therefore, the increase in serum potassium level is usually not catastrophic in otherwise healthy patients. Severely high blood levels of potassium will cause changes in cardiac electrophysiology, which, if severe, can result in asystole. = Malignant hyperthermia = Malignant hyperthermia (MH) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism. This overwhelms the body's capacity to supply oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate body temperature, eventually leading to circulatory collapse and death if not treated quickly. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is often inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, for which there are at least six genetic loci of interest, the most prominent being the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1). MH susceptibility is phenotype and genetically related to central core disease (CCD), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized both by MH symptoms and by myopathy. MH is usually unmasked by anesthesia, or when a family member develops the symptoms. There is no simple, straightforward test to diagnose the condition. When MH develops during a procedure, treatment with dantrolene sodium is usually initiated; dantrolene and the avoidance of suxamethonium administration in susceptible people have markedly reduced the mortality from this condition. =Apnea= The normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases. However plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced in some people due to either genetic variation or acquired conditions, which results in a prolonged duration of neuromuscular block. Genetically, ninety six percent of the population have a normal (Eu:Eu) genotype and block duration; however, some people have atypical genes (Ea, Es, Ef) which can be found in varying combinations with the Eu gene, or other atypical genes (see Pseudocholinesterase deficiency). Such genes will result in a longer duration of action of the drug, ranging from 20 minutes up to several hours. Acquired factors that affect plasma cholinesterase activity include pregnancy, liver disease, kidney failure, heart failure, thyrotoxicosis, and cancer, as well as a number of other drugs. If unrecognized by a clinician it could lead to awareness if anesthesia is discontinued whilst still paralyzed or hypoxemia (and potentially fatal consequences) if artificial ventilation is not maintained. Normal treatment is to maintain sedation and ventilate the patient on an intensive care unit until muscle function has returned. Blood testing for cholinesterase function can be performed. Mivacurium, a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug, is also metabolized via the same route with a similar clinical effect in patients deficient in plasma cholinesterase activity. Deliberate induction of conscious apnea using this drug led to its use as a form of aversion therapy in the 1960s and 1970s in some prison and institutional settings. This use was discontinued after negative publicity concerning the terrifying effects on subjects of this treatment and ethical questions about the punitive use of painful aversion. Mechanism of action There are two phases to the blocking effect of suxamethonium. =Phase 1 block= Phase 1 blocking has the principal paralytic effect. Binding of suxamethonium to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor results in opening of the receptor's monovalent cation channel; a disorganized depolarization of the motor end-plate occurs and calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In normal skeletal muscle, acetylcholine dissociates from the receptor following depolarization and is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The muscle cell is then ready for the next signal. Suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine, and is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase. By maintaining the membrane potential above threshold, it does not allow the muscle cell to repolarize. When acetylcholine binds to an already depolarized receptor, it cannot cause further depolarization. Calcium is removed from the muscle cell cytoplasm independent of repolarization (depolarization signaling and muscle contraction are independent processes). As the calcium is taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle relaxes. This explains muscle flaccidity rather than tetany following fasciculations. The results are membrane depolarization and transient fasciculations, followed by paralysis. =Phase 2 block= While this phase is not abnormal and is a part of its mechanism of action, it is undesirable during surgery, due to the inability to depolarize the cell again. Often, patients must be on a ventilator for hours if Phase 2 block occurs. It is caused by the blood concentration of suxamethonium exceeding the therapeutic window. Desensitization occurs at the nerve terminal, and the myocyte becomes less sensitive to acetylcholine; the membrane repolarizes and cannot be depolarized again. Chemistry Suxamethonium is an odorless, white crystalline substance. Aqueous solutions have a pH of about 4. The dihydrate melts at 160 ¬∞C, whereas the anhydrous melts at 190 ¬∞C. It is highly soluble in water (1 gram in about 1 mL), soluble in ethyl alcohol (1 gram in about 350 mL), slightly soluble in chloroform, and practically insoluble in ether. Suxamethonium is a hygroscopic compound. The compound consists of two acetylcholine molecules that are linked by their acetyl groups. It can also be viewed as a central moiety of succinic acid with two choline moieties, one on each end. History Suxamethonium was first discovered in 1906 by Reid Hunt and Ren√© de M. Taveau. When studying the drug, animals were given curare and thus they missed the neuromuscular blocking properties of suxamethonium. Instead in 1949 an Italian group led by Daniel Bovet was first to describe succinylcholine induced paralysis. The clinical introduction of suxamethonium was described in 1951 by several groups. Papers published by Stephen Thesleff and Otto von Dardel in Sweden are important but also to be mentioned is work by Bruck, Mayrhofer and Hassfurther in Austria, Scurr and Bourne in UK, and Foldes in America.

A stationary boiler (United States). A boiler is a closed vessel in which fluid (generally water) is heated. The fluid does not necessarily boil. The heated or vaporized fluid exits the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications, including water heating, central heating, boiler-based power generation, cooking, and sanitation. Heat sources In a fossil fuel power plant using a steam cycle for power generation, the primary heat source will be combustion of coal, oil, or natural gas. In some cases byproduct fuel such as the carbon- monoxide rich offgasses of a coke battery can be burned to heat a boiler; biofuels such as bagasse, where economically available, can also be used. In a nuclear power plant, boilers called steam generators are heated by the heat produced by nuclear fission. Where a large volume of hot gas is available from some process, a heat recovery steam generator or recovery boiler can use the heat to produce steam, with little or no extra fuel consumed; such a configuration is common in a combined cycle power plant where a gas turbine and a steam boiler are used. In all cases the combustion product waste gases are separate from the working fluid of the steam cycle, making these systems examples of External combustion engines. Materials The pressure vessel of a boiler is usually made of steel (or alloy steel), or historically of wrought iron. Stainless steel, especially of the austenitic types, is not used in wetted parts of boilers due to corrosion and stress corrosion cracking.ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section I, PG-5.5, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (2010) However, ferritic stainless steel is often used in superheater sections that will not be exposed to boiling water, and electrically-heated stainless steel shell boilers are allowed under the European \\"Pressure Equipment Directive\\" for production of steam for sterilizers and disinfectors.BS EN 14222: \\"Stainless steel shell boilers\\" In live steam models, copper or brass is often used because it is more easily fabricated in smaller size boilers. Historically, copper was often used for fireboxes (particularly for steam locomotives), because of its better formability and higher thermal conductivity; however, in more recent times, the high price of copper often makes this an uneconomic choice and cheaper substitutes (such as steel) are used instead. For much of the Victorian \\"age of steam\\", the only material used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron, with assembly by riveting. This iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks, such as those in the Cleator Moor (UK) area, noted for the high quality of their rolled plate, which was especially suitable for use in critical applications such as high-pressure boilers. In the 20th century, design practice moved towards the use of steel, with welded construction, which is stronger and cheaper, and can be fabricated more quickly and with less labour. Wrought iron boilers corrode far more slowly than their modern- day steel counterparts, and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion. That makes the longevity of older wrought-iron boilers far superior to that of welded steel boilers. Cast iron may be used for the heating vessel of domestic water heaters. Although such heaters are usually termed \\"boilers\\" in some countries, their purpose is usually to produce hot water, not steam, and so they run at low pressure and try to avoid boiling. The brittleness of cast iron makes it impractical for high-pressure steam boilers. Energy The source of heat for a boiler is combustion of any of several fuels, such as wood, coal, oil, or natural gas. Electric steam boilers use resistance- or immersion-type heating elements. Nuclear fission is also used as a heat source for generating steam, either directly (BWR) or, in most cases, in specialised heat exchangers called \\"steam generators\\" (PWR). Heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) use the heat rejected from other processes such as gas turbine. Boiler efficiency There are two methods to measure the boiler efficiency according ASME performance test code (PTC) for boilers ASME PTC 4 ASME Performance Test Codes and for HRSG ASME PTC 4.4 and EN 12952-15 EN 12952-15 for water tube boilers: # Input Output Method (Direct method) # Heat Loss Method (Indirect method) =Input Output Method (Direct method)= Direct method of boiler efficiency test is more usable or more common. Boiler efficiency = power out / power in = (Q * (Hg - Hf)) / (q * GCV) * 100% Q = rate of steam flow in kg/h Hg = enthalpy of saturated steam in kcal/kg Hf = enthalpy of feed water in kcal/kg q = rate of fuel use in kg/h GCV = gross calorific value in kcal/kg (e.g. pet coke 8200 kcal/kg) =Heat Loss Method (Indirect method)= To measure the boiler efficiency in indirect method, parameter like these are needed: * Ultimate analysis of fuel (H2, S2, S, C, moisture constraint, ash constraint) * Percentage of O2 or CO2 at flue gas * Flue gas temperature at outlet * Ambient temperature in ¬∞C and humidity of air in kg/kg * GCV of fuel in kcal/kg * Ash percentage in combustible fuel * GCV of ash in kcal/kg Configurations Boilers can be classified into the following configurations: *Pot boiler or Haycock boiler/Haystack boiler: A primitive \\"kettle\\" where a fire heats a partially filled water container from below. 18th century Haycock boilers generally produced and stored large volumes of very low-pressure steam, often hardly above that of the atmosphere. These could burn wood or most often, coal. Efficiency was very low. *Flued boiler with one or two large flues‚Äîan early type or forerunner of fire-tube boiler. *Diagram of a fire-tube boilerFire-tube boiler: Here, water partially fills a boiler barrel with a small volume left above to accommodate the steam (steam space). This is the type of boiler used in nearly all steam locomotives. The heat source is inside a furnace or firebox that has to be kept permanently surrounded by the water in order to maintain the temperature of the heating surface below the boiling point. The furnace can be situated at one end of a fire-tube which lengthens the path of the hot gases, thus augmenting the heating surface which can be further increased by making the gases reverse direction through a second parallel tube or a bundle of multiple tubes (two-pass or return flue boiler); alternatively the gases may be taken along the sides and then beneath the boiler through flues (3-pass boiler). In case of a locomotive-type boiler, a boiler barrel extends from the firebox and the hot gases pass through a bundle of fire tubes inside the barrel which greatly increases the heating surface compared to a single tube and further improves heat transfer. Fire-tube boilers usually have a comparatively low rate of steam production, but high steam storage capacity. Fire-tube boilers mostly burn solid fuels, but are readily adaptable to those of the liquid or gas variety. Fire-tube boilers may also be referred to as \\"scotch-marine\\" or \\"marine\\" type boilers. *Diagram of a water-tube boiler.Water-tube boiler: In this type, tubes filled with water are arranged inside a furnace in a number of possible configurations. Often the water tubes connect large drums, the lower ones containing water and the upper ones steam and water; in other cases, such as a mono-tube boiler, water is circulated by a pump through a succession of coils. This type generally gives high steam production rates, but less storage capacity than the above. Water tube boilers can be designed to exploit any heat source and are generally preferred in high-pressure applications since the high-pressure water/steam is contained within small diameter pipes which can withstand the pressure with a thinner wall. These boilers are commonly constructed in place, roughly square in shape, and can be multiple stories tall. **Flash boiler: A flash boiler is a specialized type of water-tube boiler in which tubes are close together and water is pumped through them. A flash boiler differs from the type of mono-tube steam generator in which the tube is permanently filled with water. In a flash boiler, the tube is kept so hot that the water feed is quickly flashed into steam and superheated. Flash boilers had some use in automobiles in the 19th century and this use continued into the early 20th century. steam locomotive boiler, from a Victorian Railways J class *Fire-tube boiler with Water-tube firebox. Sometimes the two above types have been combined in the following manner: the firebox contains an assembly of water tubes, called thermic siphons. The gases then pass through a conventional firetube boiler. Water- tube fireboxes were installed in many Hungarian locomotives, but have met with little success in other countries. *Sectional boiler. In a cast iron sectional boiler, sometimes called a \\"pork chop boiler\\" the water is contained inside cast iron sections. These sections are assembled on site to create the finished boiler. Safety To define and secure boilers safely, some professional specialized organizations such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) develop standards and regulation codes. For instance, the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code is a standard providing a wide range of rules and directives to ensure compliance of the boilers and other pressure vessels with safety, security and design standards.Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspection According to ASME Historically, boilers were a source of many serious injuries and property destruction due to poorly understood engineering principles. Thin and brittle metal shells can rupture, while poorly welded or riveted seams could open up, leading to a violent eruption of the pressurized steam. When water is converted to steam it expands to over 1,000 times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over . Because of this, steam is a great way of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler house to where it is needed, but without the right boiler feed water treatment, a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and corrosion. At best, this increases energy costs and can lead to poor quality steam, reduced efficiency, shorter plant life and unreliable operation. At worst, it can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of life. Collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scalding-hot steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute, injuring the firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber. Extremely large boilers providing hundreds of horsepower to operate factories can potentially demolish entire buildings.The Locomotive, by Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, Published by Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co., 1911, Item notes: n.s.:v.28 (1910‚Äì11), Original from Harvard University, Digitized December 11, 2007 by Google Books, Link to digitized document: an article on a massive Pabst Brewing Company boiler explosion in 1909 that destroyed a building, and blew parts onto the roof of nearby buildings. This document also contains a list of day-by-day boiler accidents and accident summaries by year, and discussions of boiler damage claims. A boiler that has a loss of feed water and is permitted to boil dry can be extremely dangerous. If feed water is then sent into the empty boiler, the small cascade of incoming water instantly boils on contact with the superheated metal shell and leads to a violent explosion that cannot be controlled even by safety steam valves. Draining of the boiler can also happen if a leak occurs in the steam supply lines that is larger than the make-up water supply could replace. The Hartford Loop was invented in 1919 by the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company as a method to help prevent this condition from occurring, and thereby reduce their insurance claims.Dan Holohan.\\"What you should know about Hartford Loops\\". \\"The Hartford Loop on Steam Boilers\\". Superheated steam boiler A superheated boiler on a steam locomotive. When water is boiled the result is saturated steam, also referred to as \\"wet steam.\\" Saturated steam, while mostly consisting of water vapor, carries some unevaporated water in the form of droplets. Saturated steam is useful for many purposes, such as cooking, heating and sanitation, but is not desirable when steam is expected to convey energy to machinery, such as a ship's propulsion system or the \\"motion\\" of a steam locomotive. This is because unavoidable temperature and/or pressure loss that occurs as steam travels from the boiler to the machinery will cause some condensation, resulting in liquid water being carried into the machinery. The water entrained in the steam may damage turbine blades or in the case of a reciprocating steam engine, may cause serious mechanical damage due to hydrostatic lock. Superheated steam boilers evaporate the water and then further heat the steam in a superheater, causing the discharged steam temperature to be substantially above the boiling temperature at the boiler's operating pressure. As the resulting \\"dry steam\\" is much hotter than needed to stay in the vaporous state it will not contain any significant unevaporated water. Also, higher steam pressure will be possible than with saturated steam, enabling the steam to carry more energy. Although superheating adds more energy to the steam in the form of heat there is no effect on pressure, which is determined by the rate at which steam is drawn from the boiler and the pressure settings of the safety valves.Bell, A.M. (1952) Locomotives 1 p 46. Virtue and Company Ltd, London The fuel consumption required to generate superheated steam is greater than that required to generate an equivalent volume of saturated steam. However, the overall energy efficiency of the steam plant (the combination of boiler, superheater, piping and machinery) generally will be improved enough to more than offset the increased fuel consumption. Superheater operation is similar to that of the coils on an air conditioning unit, although for a different purpose. The steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace, an area in which the temperature is typically between . Some superheaters are radiant type, which as the name suggests, they absorb heat by radiation. Others are convection type, absorbing heat from a fluid. Some are a combination of the two types. Through either method, the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within. The design of any superheated steam plant presents several engineering challenges due to the high working temperatures and pressures. One consideration is the introduction of feedwater to the boiler. The pump used to charge the boiler must be able to overcome the boiler's operating pressure, else water will not flow. As a superheated boiler is usually operated at high pressure, the corresponding feedwater pressure must be even higher, demanding a more robust pump design. Another consideration is safety. High pressure, superheated steam can be extremely dangerous if it unintentionally escapes. To give the reader some perspective, the steam plants used in many U.S. Navy destroyers built during World War II operated at pressure and superheat. In the event of a major rupture of the system, an ever-present hazard in a warship during combat, the enormous energy release of escaping superheated steam, expanding to more than 1600 times its confined volume, would be equivalent to a cataclysmic explosion, whose effects would be exacerbated by the steam release occurring in a confined space, such as a ship's engine room. Also, small leaks that are not visible at the point of leakage could be lethal if an individual were to step into the escaping steam's path. Hence designers endeavor to give the steam-handling components of the system as much strength as possible to maintain integrity. Special methods of coupling steam pipes together are used to prevent leaks, with very high pressure systems employing welded joints to avoided leakage problems with threaded or gasketed connections. =Supercritical steam generator= Boiler for a power plant. Supercritical steam generators are frequently used for the production of electric power. They operate at supercritical pressure. In contrast to a \\"subcritical boiler\\", a supercritical steam generator operates at such a high pressure (over ) that the physical turbulence that characterizes boiling ceases to occur; the fluid is neither liquid nor gas but a super-critical fluid. There is no generation of steam bubbles within the water, because the pressure is above the critical pressure point at which steam bubbles can form. As the fluid expands through the turbine stages, its thermodynamic state drops below the critical point as it does work turning the turbine which turns the electrical generator from which power is ultimately extracted. The fluid at that point may be a mix of steam and liquid droplets as it passes into the condenser. This results in slightly less fuel use and therefore less greenhouse gas production. The term \\"boiler\\" should not be used for a supercritical pressure steam generator, as no \\"boiling\\" occurs in this device. Accessories =Boiler fittings and accessories= * Pressuretrols to control the steam pressure in the boiler. Boilers generally have 2 or 3 pressuretrols: a manual-reset pressuretrol, which functions as a safety by setting the upper limit of steam pressure, the operating pressuretrol, which controls when the boiler fires to maintain pressure, and for boilers equipped with a modulating burner, a modulating pressuretrol which controls the amount of fire. * Safety valve: It is used to relieve pressure and prevent possible explosion of a boiler. * Water level indicators: They show the operator the level of fluid in the boiler, also known as a sight glass, water gauge or water column. * Bottom blowdown valves: They provide a means for removing solid particulates that condense and lie on the bottom of a boiler. As the name implies, this valve is usually located directly on the bottom of the boiler, and is occasionally opened to use the pressure in the boiler to push these particulates out. * Continuous blowdown valve: This allows a small quantity of water to escape continuously. Its purpose is to prevent the water in the boiler becoming saturated with dissolved salts. Saturation would lead to foaming and cause water droplets to be carried over with the steam ‚Äì a condition known as priming. Blowdown is also often used to monitor the chemistry of the boiler water. * Trycock: a type of valve that is often use to manually check a liquid level in a tank. Most commonly found on a water boiler. * Flash tank: High-pressure blowdown enters this vessel where the steam can 'flash' safely and be used in a low-pressure system or be vented to atmosphere while the ambient pressure blowdown flows to drain. * Automatic blowdown/continuous heat recovery system: This system allows the boiler to blowdown only when makeup water is flowing to the boiler, thereby transferring the maximum amount of heat possible from the blowdown to the makeup water. No flash tank is generally needed as the blowdown discharged is close to the temperature of the makeup water. * Hand holes: They are steel plates installed in openings in \\"header\\" to allow for inspections & installation of tubes and inspection of internal surfaces. *Steam drum internals, a series of screen, scrubber & cans (cyclone separators). * Low-water cutoff: It is a mechanical means (usually a float switch) or an electrode with a safety switch that is used to turn off the burner or shut off fuel to the boiler to prevent it from running once the water goes below a certain point. If a boiler is \\"dry-fired\\" (burned without water in it) it can cause rupture or catastrophic failure. *Surface blowdown line: It provides a means for removing foam or other lightweight non-condensible substances that tend to float on top of the water inside the boiler. * Circulating pump: It is designed to circulate water back to the boiler after it has expelled some of its heat. * Feedwater check valve or clack valve: A non-return stop valve in the feedwater line. This may be fitted to the side of the boiler, just below the water level, or to the top of the boiler.Bell (1952: 1 35) *Top feed: In this design for feedwater injection, the water is fed to the top of the boiler. This can reduce boiler fatigue caused by thermal stress. By spraying the feedwater over a series of trays the water is quickly heated and this can reduce limescale. *Desuperheater tubes or bundles: A series of tubes or bundles of tubes in the water drum or the steam drum designed to cool superheated steam, in order to supply auxiliary equipment that does not need, or may be damaged by, dry steam. *Chemical injection line: A connection to add chemicals for controlling feedwater pH. =Steam accessories= * Main steam stop valve: * Steam traps: * Main steam stop/check valve: It is used on multiple boiler installations. =Combustion accessories= * Fuel oil system:fuel oil heaters * Gas system: * Coal system: =Other essential items= * Pressure gauges: * Feed pumps: * Fusible plug: * Insulation and lagging; * Inspectors test pressure gauge attachment: * Name plate: * Registration plate:  Draught  A fuel-heated boiler must provide air to oxidize its fuel. Early boilers provided this stream of air, or draught, through the natural action of convection in a chimney connected to the exhaust of the combustion chamber. Since the heated flue gas is less dense than the ambient air surrounding the boiler, the flue gas rises in the chimney, pulling denser, fresh air into the combustion chamber. Most modern boilers depend on mechanical draught rather than natural draught. This is because natural draught is subject to outside air conditions and temperature of flue gases leaving the furnace, as well as the chimney height. All these factors make proper draught hard to attain and therefore make mechanical draught equipment much more reliable and economical. Types of draught can also be divided into induced draught, where exhaust gases are pulled out of the boiler; forced draught, where fresh air is pushed into the boiler; and balanced draught, where both effects are employed. Natural draught through the use of a chimney is a type of induced draught; mechanical draught can be induced, forced or balanced. There are two types of mechanical induced draught. The first is through use of a steam jet. The steam jet oriented in the direction of flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall draught in the furnace. This method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys. The second method is by simply using an induced draught fan (ID fan) which removes flue gases from the furnace and forces the exhaust gas up the stack. Almost all induced draught furnaces operate with a slightly negative pressure. Mechanical forced draught is provided by means of a fan forcing air into the combustion chamber. Air is often passed through an air heater; which, as the name suggests, heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler. Dampers are used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace. Forced draught furnaces usually have a positive pressure. Balanced draught is obtained through use of both induced and forced draught. This is more common with larger boilers where the flue gases have to travel a long distance through many boiler passes. The induced draught fan works in conjunction with the forced draught fan allowing the furnace pressure to be maintained slightly below atmospheric.

Wade The United States abortion-rights movement (also known as the pro-choice movement) is a sociopolitical movement in the United States supporting the view that a woman should have the legal right to an elective abortion, meaning the right to terminate her pregnancy, and is part of a broader global abortion-rights movement. The movement consists of a variety of organizations, with no single centralized decision-making body. A key point in abortion rights in the United States was the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which struck down most state laws restricting abortion, thereby decriminalizing and legalizing elective abortion in a number of states. On the other side of the abortion debate in the United States is the anti-abortion movement (or pro- life movement), which seeks to protect fetuses by outlawing or restricting abortion. Within this group, many argue that human life begins at conception, a position rejected by the abortion rights groups.  Overview  Abortion- rights advocates argue that whether or not a pregnant woman continues with a pregnancy should be her personal choice, as it involves her body, personal health, and future. They also argue that the availability of legal abortions reduces the exposure of women to the risks associated with illegal abortions. More broadly, abortion-rights advocates frame their arguments in terms of individual liberty, reproductive freedom, and reproductive rights. The first of these terms was widely used to describe many of the political movements of the 19th and 20th centuries (such as in the abolition of slavery in Europe and the United States, and in the spread of popular democracy) whereas the latter terms derive from changing perspectives on sexual freedom and bodily integrity. Abortion-rights supporters rarely consider themselves \\"pro- abortion\\", because they consider termination of a pregnancy as a bodily autonomy issue, and find forced abortion to be as legally and morally indefensible as the outlawing of abortion. Indeed, some who support abortion rights consider themselves opposed to some or all abortions on a moral basis, but believe that abortions would happen in any case and that legal abortion under medically controlled conditions is preferable to illegal back-alley abortion without proper medical supervision. Such people believe the death rate of women due to such procedures in areas where abortions are only available outside of the medical establishment is unacceptable. Some who argue from a philosophical viewpoint believe that an embryo has no rights as it is only a potential and not an actual person and that it should not have rights that override those of the pregnant woman at least until it is viable. Many abortion-rights campaigners also note that some anti-abortion activists also oppose practices that correlate with less demand for abortion, namely sex education and the ready availability of contraception. Proponents of this argument point to cases of areas with limited sex education and contraceptive access that have high abortion rates, either legal or illegal. Some women also travel to another jurisdiction or country where they may obtain an abortion. For example, a large number of Irish women would visit the United Kingdom for abortions, as would Belgian women who travelled to France before Belgium legalized abortion. Similarly, women would travel to the Netherlands when it became legal to have abortions there in the 1970s. Some people who support abortion rights see abortion as a last resort and focus on situations where they feel abortion is a necessary option. Among these situations are those where the woman was raped, her health or life (or that of the fetus) is at risk, contraception was used but failed, the fetus has acute congenital disorder and defects, incest, financial constraints, overpopulation, or she feels unable to raise a child. One common reason women give for terminating unintended pregnancies is that having a baby would prevent them from achieving goals such as pursuing an education. Some abortion-rights moderates, who would otherwise be willing to accept certain restrictions on abortion, feel that political pragmatism compels them to oppose any such restrictions, as they could be used to form a slippery slope against all abortions. On the other hand, even some abortion rights advocates feel uncomfortable with the use of abortion for sex-selection, as is practiced in some countries, such as India. History Abortion-rights activists before the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., at the March for Women's Lives in 2004 November 12, 1989 Washington, D.C. abortion rights march Prior to 1973, abortion rights in the United States were not seen as a constitutional issue. Abortion was seen as a purely state matter, all of which had some type of restrictions. The first legal restrictions on abortion appeared in the 1820s, forbidding abortion after the fourth month of pregnancy. A number of early feminists expressed decided skepticism about outlawing abortion. They disliked abortion but thought anti-abortion laws did not apply ‚Äúthe proper remedies,‚Äù according to one nineteenth-century women‚Äôs rights pioneer. By 1900, legislators at the urgings of the American Medical Association (AMA) had enacted laws banning abortion in most U.S. states. The AMA played a vital role in stigmatizing abortions by using their status and power to create a moral stance against abortion. The AMA viewed abortion providers as unwanted healthcare competitors. Due to the high maternal morbidity and mortality rates caused by back alley abortions, physicians, nurses, and social workers pushed for legalization of abortion from a pro-public health perspective. Support for abortion rights went beyond feminists and medical professions. The broad support for legalizing abortion in the 1960s also derived from certain religious leaders. For example, there were 1,400 clergy operating on the East Coast for the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion‚Äîan underground network that connected women seeking abortions to doctors‚Äîduring the 1960s. As the historian Christine Stansell explained, many religious leaders came to approach the abortion rights argument from a position of individual conscience instead of from dogma by witnessing the \\"strains unwanted pregnancies put on members of their congregations\\".Christine Stansell, The Feminist Promise: 1792 to the Present (New York: Modern Library, 2010), 317. In its landmark 1973 case, Roe v. Wade where a woman challenged the Texas laws criminalizing abortion, the U.S. Supreme Court reached two important conclusions: * That state abortion laws are subject to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and * That the procurement of an abortion was a constitutional right during the first and second trimesters of a pregnancy based on the constitutional right to privacy, but that the state's interest in protecting \\"potential life\\" prevailed in the third trimester unless the woman's health was at risk. In subsequent rulings, the Court rejected the trimester framework altogether in favor of a cutoff at the point of fetal viability (cf. Planned Parenthood v. Casey). Abortion-rights groups are active in all American states and at the federal level, campaigning for legal abortion and against the reimposition of anti-abortion laws, with varying degrees of success. Only a few states allow abortion without limitation or regulation, but most do allow various limited forms of abortion. In the wake of extreme abortion restrictions in states like Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and Ohio, transgender, intersex and other gender-nonconforming people felt forgotten in this movement. Abortion is one of the most common medical interventions undergone by women aged 15‚Äì44. In the USA childbirth carries a risk of death about 14 times higher than abortion. In the United States, the Democratic Party's platform endorses the abortion-rights position, stating that abortion should be \\"safe, legal, and rare\\". Not all Democrats agree with the platform, however, and there is a small pro-life faction within the party, expressed in such groups as Democrats for Life of America. Similarly, there is a small abortion-rights faction within the Republican Party. The Libertarian Party holds \\"that government should be kept out of the matter\\".Plank 1.4 Abortion, at Libertarian Party website. Organizations and individuals The abortion rights movement includes a variety of organizations, with no single centralized decision-making body. Many more individuals who are not members of these organizations also support their views and arguments. Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the National Abortion Federation, the National Organization for Women, and the American Civil Liberties Union are the leading abortion-rights advocacy and lobbying groups in the United States. Most major feminist organizations also support abortion-rights positions, as do the American Medical Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and pro-abortion rights physicians such as Eugene Gu and Warren Hern who have fought political opposition from anti-abortion Senator Marsha Blackburn. Faith-based groups that advocate for abortion rights include notably the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and Catholics for Choice.

In the context of surgery, a local anesthetic creates an absence of pain in a specific location of the body without a loss of consciousness, as opposed to a general anesthetic. When it is used on specific nerve pathways (local anesthetic nerve block), paralysis (loss of muscle power) also can be achieved. Clinical LAs belong to one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester local anesthetics. Synthetic LAs are structurally related to cocaine. They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have a very low abuse potential and do not produce hypertension or (with few exceptions) vasoconstriction. They are used in various techniques of local anesthesia such as: * Topical anesthesia (surface) * Topical administration of cream, gel, ointment, liquid, or spray of anaesthetic dissolved in DMSO or other solvents/carriers for deeper absorption * Infiltration * Brachial plexus block * Epidural (extradural) block * Spinal anesthesia (subarachnoid block) * Iontophoresis  Medical uses  =Acute pain= Acute pain may occur due to trauma, surgery, infection, disruption of blood circulation, or many other conditions in which tissue injury occurs. In a medical setting, pain alleviation is desired when its warning function is no longer needed. Besides improving patient comfort, pain therapy can also reduce harmful physiological consequences of untreated pain. Acute pain can often be managed using analgesics. However, conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects. For purposes of pain therapy, LA drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter. LA drugs are also often combined with other agents such as opioids for synergistic analgesic action. Low doses of LA drugs can be sufficient so that muscle weakness does not occur and patients may be mobilized. Some typical uses of conduction anesthesia for acute pain are: * Labor pain (epidural anesthesia, pudendal nerve blocks) * Postoperative pain (peripheral nerve blocks, epidural anesthesia) * Trauma (peripheral nerve blocks, intravenous regional anesthesia, epidural anesthesia) =Chronic pain = Chronic pain is a complex and often serious condition that requires diagnosis and treatment by an expert in pain medicine. LAs can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain, usually in combination with medication such as opioids, NSAIDs, and anticonvulsants. Though it can be easily performed, repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long- term benefits. = Surgery = Virtually every part of the body can be anesthetized using conduction anesthesia. However, only a limited number of techniques are in common clinical use. Sometimes, conduction anesthesia is combined with general anesthesia or sedation for the patient's comfort and ease of surgery. However, many anaesthetists, surgeons, patients and nurses believe that it is safer to perform major surgeries under local anesthesia than general anesthesia. Typical operations performed under conduction anesthesia include: * Dentistry (surface anesthesia, infiltration anesthesia or intraligamentary anesthesia during restorative operations such as fillings, crowns, and root canals, or extractions, and regional nerve blocks during extractions and surgeries) * Podiatry (cutaneous, nail avulsions, matricectomy, bunionectomy, hammertoe repair and various other podiatric procedures) * Eye surgery (surface anesthesia with topical anesthetics or retrobulbar block during cataract removal or other ophthalmic procedures) * ENT operations, head and neck surgery (infiltration anesthesia, field blocks, or peripheral nerve blocks, plexus anesthesia) * Shoulder and arm surgery (plexus anesthesia or intravenous regional anesthesia) * Heart and lung surgery (epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia) * Abdominal surgery (epidural anesthesia/spinal anesthesia, often combined with general anesthesia during inguinal hernia repair or other abdominal surgery ) * Gynecological, obstetrical, and urological operations (spinal/epidural anesthesia) * Bone and joint surgery of the pelvis, hip, and leg (spinal/epidural anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks, or intravenous regional anesthesia) * Surgery of skin and peripheral blood vessels (topical anesthesia, field blocks, peripheral nerve blocks, or spinal/epidural anesthesia) = Diagnostic Tests = Diagnostic tests such as bone marrow aspiration, lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and aspiration of cysts or other structures are made to be less painful upon administration of local anesthetic before insertion of larger needles. = Other uses = Local anesthesia is also used during insertion of IV devices, such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, ports used for giving chemotherapy medications and hemodialysis access catheters. Topical anesthesia, in the form of lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA) is most commonly used to enable relatively painless venipuncture (blood collection) and placement of intravenous cannulae. It may also be suitable for other kinds of punctures such as ascites drainage and amniocentesis. Surface anesthesia also facilitates some endoscopic procedures such as bronchoscopy (visualization of the lower airways) or cystoscopy (visualization of the inner surface of the bladder)  Side effects  =Localized side effects= Edema of tongue, pharynx and larynx may develop as a side effect of local anaesthesia. This could be caused by a variety of reasons including trauma during injection, infection, an allergic reaction, haematoma or injection of irritating solutions such as cold-sterilisation solutions. Usually there is tissue swelling at the point of injection. This is due to puncturing of the vein which allows the blood to flow into loose tissues in the surrounding area. Blanching of the tissues in the area where the local anaesthetic is deposited is also common. This gives the area a white appearance as the blood flow is prevented due to vasoconstriction of arteries in the area. The vasoconstriction stimulus gradually wears off and subsequently the tissue returns to normal in less than 2 hours. The side effects of inferior alveolar nerve block include feeling tense, clenching of the fists and moaning. The duration of soft tissue anaesthesia is longer than pulpal anaesthesia and is often associated with difficulty eating, drinking and speaking. Risks The risk of temporary or permanent nerve damage varies between different locations and types of nerve blocks. There is risk of accidental damage to local blood vessels during injection of the local anaesthetic solution. This is referred to as Haematoma and could result in pain, trismus, swelling and/or discolouration of the region. The density of tissues surrounding the injured vessels is an important factor for Haematoma. There is greatest chance of this occurring in a posterior superior alveolar nerve block or in a pterygomandibular block. Giving local anaesthesia to patients with liver disease can have significant consequences. Thorough evaluation of the disease should be carried out to assess potential risk to the patient as in significant liver dysfunction, the half-life of amide local anaesthetic agents may be drastically increased thus increasing the risk of overdose. Local anaesthetics and vasoconstrictors may be administered to pregnant patients however it is very important to be extra cautious when giving a pregnant patient any type of drug. Lidocaine can be safely used but bupivacaine and mepivacaine should be avoided. Consultation with the obstetrician is vital before administrating any type of local anaesthetic to a pregnant patient. Recovery Permanent nerve damage after a peripheral nerve block is rare. Symptoms are likely to resolve within a few weeks. The vast majority of those affected (92%‚Äì97%) recover within four to six weeks; 99% of these people have recovered within a year. An estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage. Symptoms may continue to improve for up to 18 months following injury. =Potential side effects= General systemic adverse effects are due to the pharmacological effects of the anesthetic agents used. The conduction of electric impulses follows a similar mechanism in peripheral nerves, the central nervous system, and the heart. The effects of local anesthetics are, therefore, not specific for the signal conduction in peripheral nerves. Side effects on the central nervous system and the heart may be severe and potentially fatal. However, toxicity usually occurs only at plasma levels which are rarely reached if proper anesthetic techniques are adhered to. High plasma levels might arise, for example, when doses intended for epidural or intrasupport tissue administration are accidentally delivered as intravascular injection.  Emotional reactions  When patients are emotionally affected in the form of nervousness or fear, it can lead to vasovagal collapse. This is the anticipation of pain during administration that activates the parasympathetic nervous system while inhibiting the orthosympathetic nervous system. What results is a dilation of arteries in muscles which can lead to a reduction in circulating blood volume inducing a temporary shortness of blood flow to the brain. Notable symptoms include restlessness, visibly looking pale, perspiration and possible the loss of consciousness. In severe cases, clonic cramps resembling an epileptic insult may occur. On the other hand, fear of administration can also result in accelerated, shallow breathing, or hyperventilation. The patient may feel a tingling sensation in hands and feet or a sense of light-headedness and increased chest pressure. Hence, it is crucial for the medical professional administrating the local anaesthesia, especially in the form of an injection, to ensure that the patient is in a comfortable setting and has any potential fears alleviated in order to avoid these possible complications.  Central nervous system  Depending on local tissue concentrations of local anesthetics, excitatory or depressant effects on the central nervous system may occur. Initial symptoms of systemic toxicity include ringing in the ears (tinnitus), a metallic taste in the mouth, tingling or numbness of the mouth, dizziness and/or disorientation. At higher concentrations, a relatively selective depression of inhibitory neurons results in cerebral excitation, which may lead to more advanced symptoms include motor twitching in the periphery followed by grand mal seizures. It is reported that seizures are more likely to occur when bupivacaine is used, particularly in combination with chloroprocaine. A profound depression of brain functions may occur at even higher concentrations which may lead to coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose. Another possibility is direct exposure of the central nervous system through the cerebrospinal fluid, i.e., overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia.  Cardiovascular system  Cardiac toxicity can result from improper injection of agent into a vessel. Even with proper administration, it is inevitable for some diffusion of agent into the body from the site of application due to unforeseeable anatomical idiosyncrasies of the patient. This may affect the nervous system or cause the agent to enter into general circulation. However, infections are very seldom transmitted. Cardiac toxicity associated with overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic is characterized by hypotension, atrioventricular conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, bupivacaine blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function. Toxicity from anesthetic combinations is additive.  Endocrine  Endocrine and metabolic systems only have slightly adverse effects with most cases being without clinical repercussions.  Immunologic allergy  Adverse reactions to local anesthetics (especially the esters) are not uncommon, but legitimate allergies are very rare. Allergic reactions to the esters is usually due to a sensitivity to their metabolite, para-aminobenzoic acid, and does not result in cross-allergy to amides.Univ. of Wisconsin, Local Anesthesia and Regional Anesthetics Therefore, amides can be used as alternatives in those patients. Nonallergic reactions may resemble allergy in their manifestations. In some cases, skin tests and provocative challenge may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of allergy. Also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur, which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions.  Methemoglobinemia  Methemoglobinemia is a process where iron in hemoglobin is altered, reducing its oxygen-carrying capability, which produces cyanosis and symptoms of hypoxia. Exposure to aniline group chemicals such as benzocaine, lidocaine, and prilocaine can produce this effect, especially benzocaine. The systemic toxicity of prilocaine is comparatively low, but its metabolite, o-toluidine, is known to cause methemoglobinemia.  Second-generation effects  Application of local anesthetics during oocyte removal during in vitro fertilisation has been up to debate. Pharmacological concentrations of anesthetic agents have been found in follicular fluid. Clinical trials have not concluded any effects on pregnant women. However, there is some concern with the behavioral effects of lidocaine on offspring in rats. During pregnancy, it is not common for local anesthetics to have any adverse effect on the fetus. Despite this, risks of toxicity may be higher in pregnancy due to an increase in unbound fraction of local anesthetic and physiological changes increase the transfer of local anesthetic into the central nervous system. Hence, it is recommended that pregnant women use a lower dose of local anesthetic to reduce any potential complications. Treatment of overdose: \\"Lipid rescue\\" This method of toxicity treatment was invented by Dr. Guy Weinberg in 1998, and was not widely used until after the first published successful rescue in 2006. Evidence indicates Intralipid, a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anesthetic overdose, including human case reports of successful use in this way (lipid rescue). However, the evidence at this point is still limited. Though most reports to date have used Intralipid, a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, other emulsions, such as Liposyn and Medialipid, have also been shown effective. Ample supporting animal evidence and human case reports show successful use in this way. In the UK, efforts have been made to publicise this use more widely and lipid rescue has now been officially promoted as a treatment by the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.Association of Anesthesists of Great Britain and Ireland home page One published case has been reported of successful treatment of refractory cardiac arrest in bupropion and lamotrigine overdose using lipid emulsion. The design of a 'homemade' lipid rescue kit has been described.Home- made Lipid Rescue Kit Although lipid rescue mechanism of action is not completely understood, the added lipid in the blood stream may act as a sink, allowing for the removal of lipophilic toxins from affected tissues. This theory is compatible with two studies on lipid rescue for clomipramine toxicity in rabbits and with a clinical report on the use of lipid rescue in veterinary medicine to treat a puppy with moxidectin toxicosis.  Mechanism of action  All LAs are membrane-stabilizing drugs; they reversibly decrease the rate of depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes (like nociceptors). Though many other drugs also have membrane-stabilizing properties, not all are used as LAs (propranolol, for example, though it has LA properties). LA drugs act mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, in particular the so-called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an activated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in rapidly firing neurons. This is referred to as state- dependent blockade. LAs are weak bases and are usually formulated as the hydrochloride salt to render them water-soluble. At a pH equal to the protonated base's pKa, the protonated (ionized) and unprotonated (unionized) forms of the molecule exist in equimolar amounts, but only the unprotonated base diffuses readily across cell membranes. Once inside the cell, the local anesthetic will be in equilibrium, with the formation of the protonated (ionized) form, which does not readily pass back out of the cell. This is referred to as \\"ion-trapping\\". In the protonated form, the molecule binds to the LA binding site on the inside of the ion channel near the cytoplasmic end. Most LAs work on the internal surface of the membrane - the drug has to penetrate the cell membrane, which is achieved best in the nonionised form. Acidosis such as caused by inflammation at a wound partly reduces the action of LAs. This is partly because most of the anesthetic is ionized and therefore unable to cross the cell membrane to reach its cytoplasmic-facing site of action on the sodium channel. All nerve fibers are sensitive to LAs, but due to a combination of diameter and myelination, fibers have different sensitivities to LA blockade, termed differential blockade. Type B fibers (sympathetic tone) are the most sensitive followed by type C (pain), type A delta (temperature), type A gamma (proprioception), type A beta (sensory touch and pressure), and type A alpha (motor). Although type B fibers are thicker than type C fibers, they are myelinated, thus are blocked before the unmyelinated, thin C fiber.  Techniques  Local anesthetics can block almost every nerve between the peripheral nerve endings and the central nervous system. The most peripheral technique is topical anesthesia to the skin or other body surface. Small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually (peripheral nerve block) or in anatomic nerve bundles (plexus anesthesia). Spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia merge into the central nervous system. Injection of LAs is often painful. A number of methods can be used to decrease this pain, including buffering of the solution with bicarbonate and warming. Clinical techniques include: * Surface anesthesia is the application of an LA spray, solution, or cream to the skin or a mucous membrane; the effect is short lasting and is limited to the area of contact. * Infiltration anesthesia is infiltration of LA into the tissue to be anesthetized; surface and infiltration anesthesia are collectively topical anesthesia * Field block is subcutaneous injection of an LA in an area bordering on the field to be anesthetized. * Peripheral nerve block is injection of LA in the vicinity of a peripheral nerve to anesthetize that nerve's area of innervation. * Plexus anesthesia is injection of LA in the vicinity of a nerve plexus, often inside a tissue compartment that limits the diffusion of the drug away from the intended site of action. The anesthetic effect extends to the innervation areas of several or all nerves stemming from the plexus. * Epidural anesthesia is an LA injected into the epidural space, where it acts primarily on the spinal nerve roots; depending on the site of injection and the volume injected, the anesthetized area varies from limited areas of the abdomen or chest to large regions of the body. * Spinal anesthesia is an LA injected into the cerebrospinal fluid, usually at the lumbar spine (in the lower back), where it acts on spinal nerve roots and part of the spinal cord; the resulting anesthesia usually extends from the legs to the abdomen or chest. * Intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier's block) is when blood circulation of a limb is interrupted using a tourniquet (a device similar to a blood-pressure cuff), then a large volume of LA is injected into a peripheral vein. The drug fills the limb's venous system and diffuses into tissues, where peripheral nerves and nerve endings are anesthetized. The anesthetic effect is limited to the area that is excluded from blood circulation and resolves quickly once circulation is restored. * Local anesthesia of body cavities includes intrapleural anesthesia and intra- articular anesthesia. * Transincision (or transwound) catheter anesthesia uses a multilumen catheter inserted through an insicion or wound and aligned across it on the inside as the incision or wound is closed, providing continuous administration of local anesthetic along the incision or wounds Dental- specific techniques include: = Vazirani-Alkinosi Technique = The Vazirani- alkinosi technique is also known as the closed-mouth mandibular nerve block. It is mostly used in patients who have limited opening of the mandible or in those that have trismus; spasm of the muscles of mastication. The nerves which are anesthetised in this technique are the inferior alveolar, incisive, mental, lingual and mylohyoid nerves. Dental needles are available in 2 lengths; short and long. As Vazirani-akinosi is a local anaesthetic technique which requires penetration of a significant thickness of soft tissues, a long needle is used. The needle is inserted into the soft tissue which covers the medial border of the mandibular ramus, in region of the inferior alveolar, lingual and mylohyoid nerves. The positioning of the bevel of the needle is very important as it must be positioned away from the bone of the mandibular ramus and instead towards the midline. = Intraligamentary Infiltration = Intraligamentary infiltration, also known as periodontal ligament injection or intraligamentary injection (ILIs), is known as ‚Äúthe most universal of the supplemental injections‚Äù. ILIs are usually administered when inferior alveolar nerve block techniques are inadequate or ineffective. ILIs are purposed for: 1\\\\. Single-tooth anesthesia 2\\\\. Low anesthetic dose 3\\\\. Contraindication for systemic anesthesia 4\\\\. Presence of systemic health problems ILI utilization is expected to increase because dental patients prefer fewer soft tissue anesthesia and dentists aim to reduce administration of traditional inferior alveolar nerve block (INAB) for routine restorative procedures. Injection methodology: The periodontal ligament space provides an accessible route to the cancellous alveolar bone, and the anesthetic reaches the pulpal nerve via natural perforation of intraoral bone tissue. Advantages of ILI over INAB: rapid onset (within 30 seconds), small dosage required (0.2-1.0mL), limited area of numbness, lower intrinsic risks such as neuropathy, hematoma, trismus/jaw sprain and self-inflicted periodontal tissue injury,Nelson PW. Injection system. J Am Dent Assoc. 1981.Galili D, Kaufman E, Garfunkel AD, et al. Intraligamental anesthesia ‚Äì a histological study. International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. 1984. as well as decreased cardiovascular disturbances. Its usage as a secondary or supplementary anesthesia on the mandible has reported a high success rate of above 90%. Disadvantages: Risk of temporary periodontal tissue damage, likelihood of bacteriemia and endocarditis for at-risk populations, appropriate pressure and correct needle placement are imperative for anesthetic success, short duration of pulpal anesthesia limits the use of ILIs for several restorative procedures that require longer duration, postoperative discomfort, and injury on unerupted teeth such as enamel hypoplasia and defects. Technique description: * All plaque and calculus to be eradicated, optimally before the operative visit to assist gingival tissue healing. * Before injection, disinfect gingival sulcus with 0.2% chlorhexidine solution. * Administration of soft tissue anesthesia is recommended prior to ILI administration. This helps to enhance patient comfort. * Needle gauges of sizes 27-gauge short or 30-gauge ultra-short needle are usually utilized. * The needle is inserted along the long axis, at a 30-degree angle, of the mesial or distal root for single rooted teeth and on the mesial and distal roots of multi-rooted teeth. Bevel orientation toward the root provides easier advancement of the needle apically. * When the needle reaches between the root and crestal bone, significant resistance is experience. * Anesthetic deposition is recommended at 0.2mL, per root or site, over minimally 20 seconds. * For its success, the anesthetic must be administered under pressure. It must not leak out of the sulcus into the mouth. * Withdraw needle for minimally 10‚Äì15 seconds to permit complete deposition of solution. This can be slower than other injections as there is pressure build-up from the anesthetic administration. * Blanching of the tissue is observed and may be more evident when vasoconstrictors are used. It is caused by a temporary obstruction of blood flow to the tissue. Syringes: * Standard syringes can be used. * The intraligamentary syringe offers mechanical advantage by using a trigger-grasp or click apparatus to employ a gear or lever that improves control and results in increased force to push the anesthetic cartridge's rubber stopper forward for medication deposition with greater ease. * C-CLADs (computer controlled local anesthetic delivery devices) can be used. Its usage of computer microprocessors allows for control of fluid dynamics and anesthetic deposition. This minimizes subjective flow rates and variability in pressure. This thereby results in enhanced hydrodynamic diffusion of solution into bone or the target area of deposition, thus permitting larger amounts of anesthetic solution to be delivered during ILIs without increased tissue damage. Things to note: * ILIs are not recommended for patients with active periodontal inflammation. * ILIs should not be administered at tooth sites with 5mm or more of periodontal attachment loss. = Gow-Gates Technique = Gow-Gates technique is used to provide anesthetics to the mandible of the patient's mouth. With the aid of extra and intraoral landmarks, the needle is injected into the intraoral latero-anterior surface of the condyle, steering clear below the insertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle. The extraoral landmarks used for this technique are the lower border of the ear tragus, corners of the mouth and the angulation of the tragus on the side of the face. Biophysical forces (pulsation of the maxillary artery, muscular function of jaw movement) and gravity will aid with the diffusion of anesthetic to fill the whole pterygomandibular space. All three oral sensory parts of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve and other sensory nerves in the region will come in contact with the anesthetic and this reduces the need to anesthetise supplementary innervation. In comparison to other regional block methods of anestheising the lower jaw, the Gow-Gates technique has a higher success rate in fully anesthetising the lower jaw. One study found that out of 1,200 patients receiving injections through the Gow- Gate technique, only 2 of them did not obtain complete anesthesia.  Types  This LA system is designed to prevent needlestick injury. A cartridge of LA fits into the disposable needle, which can be locked when not in use and can be separated from the handle. Local anesthetic solutions for injection typically consist of: * The local anesthetic agent itself * A vehicle, which is usually water-based or just sterile water * Vasoconstrictor possibly (see below) * Reducing agent (antioxidant), e.g. if epinephrine is used, then sodium metabisulfite is used as a reducing agent * Preservative, e.g. methylparaben * Buffer Esters are prone to producing allergic reactions, which may necessitate the use of an amide. The names of each locally clinical anesthetic have the suffix \\"-caine\\". Most ester LAs are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase, while amide LAs are metabolized in the liver. This can be a factor in choosing an agent in patients with liver failure, although since cholinesterases are produced in the liver, physiologically (e.g. very young or very old individual) or pathologically (e.g. cirrhosis) impaired hepatic metabolism is also a consideration when using esters. Sometimes, LAs are combined, e.g.: * Lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA, eutectic mixture of local anesthetic) * Lidocaine/tetracaine (Rapydan) * TAC LA solutions for injection are sometimes mixed with vasoconstrictors (combination drug) to increase the duration of local anesthesia by constricting the blood vessels, thereby safely concentrating the anesthetic agent for an extended duration, as well as reducing hemorrhage. Because the vasoconstrictor temporarily reduces the rate at which the systemic circulation removes the local anesthetic from the area of the injection, the maximum doses of LAs when combined with a vasoconstrictor is higher compared to the same LA without any vasoconstrictor. Occasionally, cocaine is administered for this purpose. Examples include: * Prilocaine hydrochloride and epinephrine (trade name Citanest Forte) * Lidocaine, bupivacaine, and epinephrine (recommended final concentrations of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.5%, respectively) * Iontocaine, consisting of lidocaine and epinephrine * Septocaine (trade name Septodont), a combination of articaine and epinephrine One combination product of this type is used topically for surface anaesthesia, TAC (5-12% tetracaine,1/2000 (0.05%, 500 ppm, ¬Ω per mille) adrenaline, 4 or 10% cocaine). Using LA with vasoconstrictor is safe in regions supplied by end arteries. The commonly held belief that LA with vasoconstrictor can cause necrosis in extremities such as the nose, ears, fingers, and toes (due to constriction of end arteries), is invalidated, since no case of necrosis has been reported since the introduction of commercial lidocaine with epinephrine in 1948. =Ester group= Procaine * Benzocaine * Chloroprocaine * Cocaine * Cyclomethycaine * Dimethocaine (Larocaine) * Piperocaine * Propoxycaine * Procaine (Novocaine) * Proparacaine * Tetracaine (Amethocaine) =Amide group= Lidocaine * Articaine * Bupivacaine * Cinchocaine (Dibucaine) * Etidocaine * Levobupivacaine * Lidocaine (Lignocaine) * Mepivacaine * Prilocaine * Ropivacaine * Trimecaine =Naturally derived= Tetrodotoxin * Saxitoxin * Neosaxitoxin * Tetrodotoxin * Menthol * Eugenol * Cocaine *Spilanthol Most naturally occurring local anesthetics with the exceptions of menthol, eugenol and cocaine are neurotoxins, and have the suffix -toxin in their names. Cocaine binds the intracellular side of the channels while saxitoxin, neosaxitoxin & tetrodotoxin bind to the extracellular side of sodium channels.  History  In Peru, the ancient Incas are believed to have used the leaves of the coca plant as a local anaesthetic in addition to its stimulant properties. It was also used for slave payment and is thought to play a role in the subsequent destruction of Incas culture when Spaniards realized the effects of chewing the coca leaves and took advantage of it. Cocaine was first used as a local anesthetic in 1884. The search for a less toxic and less addictive substitute led to the development of the aminoester local anesthetics stovaine in 1903 and procaine in 1904. Since then, several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use, notably lidocaine in 1943, bupivacaine in 1957, and prilocaine in 1959. The invention of clinical use of local anaesthesia is credited to the Vienna School which included Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), Carl Koller (1857-1944) and Leopold Konigstein (1850-1942). They introduced local anaesthesia, using cocaine, through ‚Äòself-experimation‚Äô on their oral mucosa before introducing it to animal or human experimentation. The Vienna school first started using cocaine as local anaesthesia in ophthalmology and it was later incorporated into ophthalmologic practice. Dr. Halsted and Dr. Hall, in the United States in 1885 described an intraoral anaesthetic technique of blocking the inferior alveolar nerve and the antero- superior dental nerve using 4% cocaine.{ Shortly after the first use of cocaine for topical anesthesia, blocks on peripheral nerves were described. Brachial plexus anesthesia by percutaneous injection through axillary and supraclavicular approaches was developed in the early 20th century. The search for the most effective and least traumatic approach for plexus anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks continues to this day. In recent decades, continuous regional anesthesia using catheters and automatic pumps has evolved as a method of pain therapy. Intravenous regional anesthesia was first described by August Bier in 1908. This technique is still in use and is remarkably safe when drugs of low systemic toxicity such as prilocaine are used. Spinal anesthesia was first used in 1885, but not introduced into clinical practice until 1899, when August Bier subjected himself to a clinical experiment in which he observed the anesthetic effect, but also the typical side effect of postpunctural headache. Within a few years, spinal anesthesia became widely used for surgical anesthesia and was accepted as a safe and effective technique. Although atraumatic (noncutting-tip) cannulae and modern drugs are used today, the technique has otherwise changed very little over many decades. Epidural anesthesia by a caudal approach had been known in the early 20th century, but a well-defined technique using lumbar injection was not developed until 1921, when Fidel Pag√©s published his article \\"Anestesia Metam√©rica\\". This technique was popularized in the 1930s and 1940s by Achile Mario Dogliotti. With the advent of thin, flexible catheters, continuous infusion and repeated injections have become possible, making epidural anesthesia still a highly successful technique. Besides its many uses for surgery, epidural anesthesia is particularly popular in obstetrics for the treatment of labor pain.

Zero insertion force (ZIF) is a type of IC socket or electrical connector that requires very little force for insertion. With a ZIF socket, before the IC is inserted, a lever or slider on the side of the socket is moved, pushing all the sprung contacts apart so that the IC can be inserted with very little force - generally the weight of the IC itself is sufficient and no external downward force is required. The lever is then moved back, allowing the contacts to close and grip the pins of the IC. ZIF sockets are much more expensive than standard IC sockets and also tend to take up a larger board area due to the space taken up by the lever mechanism. Typically, they are only used when there is a good reason to do so.  Design  AMD 754). A normal integrated circuit (IC) socket requires the IC to be pushed into sprung contacts which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total insertion force can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small pin counts, each pin extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or if the board is crowded. Low insertion force (LIF) sockets reduce the issues of insertion and extraction, but because of its lower insertion force than a conventional socket, are likely to produce less reliable connections. Large ZIF sockets are only commonly found mounted on PC motherboards, being used from about the mid 1990s forward. These CPU sockets are designed to support a particular range of CPUs, allowing computer retailers and consumers to assemble motherboard/CPU combinations based on individual budget and requirements.Scott Mueller, Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Eleventh Edition, Que, 1999, pages 87-88 The rest of the electronics industry has largely abandoned sockets (of any kind) and instead moved to the use of surface mount components soldered directly to the board. Smaller ZIF sockets are commonly used in chip-testing and programming equipment, e.g., programming and testing on EEPROMs, Microcontrollers, etc.Najamuz Zaman, Automotive Electronics Design Fundamentals, Springer, 2015, , page 35 Universal test sockets Programming device for a PIC microcontroller, with a dual in-line ZIF socket Standard DIP packages come in a number of widths (measured between pin centers), with 0.3 in (7.62 mm) and 0.6 in (15.24 mm) being the most common. To allow design of programmers and similar devices that support a range of devices universal test sockets are produced. These have wide slots into which the pins drop allowing devices of differing widths to be inserted. Ball grid array sockets ZIF sockets can be used for ball grid array chips, particularly during development. These sockets tend to be unreliable, failing to grab all the solder balls. Another type of BGA socket, also free of insertion force but not a \\"ZIF socket\\" in the traditional sense, does a better job by using spring pins to push up underneath the balls. ZIF wire-to-board connectors A pair of ZIF connectors, with the flexible flat cable that connects to them. ZIF wire-to- board connectors are used for attaching wires to printed circuit boards inside electronic equipment. An example would be the cable between the LCD screen and motherboard in laptops. The wires, often formed into a ribbon cable, are pre- stripped and the bare ends placed inside the connector. The two sliding parts of the connector are then pushed together, causing it to grip the wires. The most important advantage of this system is that it does not require a mating half to be fitted to the wire ends, therefore saving space and cost inside miniaturised equipment. See flexible flat cable. Hard disk drives ZIF tape connections are used for connecting Parallel ATA and Serial ATA disk drives (mostly drives in the 1.8-inch form factor). PATA hard drives with ZIF-style connectors were used primarily in the design of ultra-portable notebooks. They have since been phased out, as SATA has a relatively small-form-factor connector by default. Mini-SATA (mSATA) can be used where even smaller form factors are required. Internally, nearly all hard drives use ZIF tape to connect their circuit board to their platter motor. ZIF tape connections are also heavily used in the design of the iPod range of portable media players, not just for the hard drive but also for other connections from the main circuit board. Three types of ZIF connectors are known to exist on 1.8 inch PATA drives. ZIF-24, ZIF-40, and ZIF-50 have 24, 40, and 50 pins respectively.

Pollution fatalities In late 1930 and early 1931, several thousand cases of acute pulmonary attacks occurred in the Meuse valley, centered on Engis, and 60 people died. A commission of inquiry set up by the Belgian government concluded that the cause was poisonous waste gases, primarily sulfur dioxide, emitted by the many factories in the valley and the furnaces used by the population, in conjunction with unusual climatic conditions coupled with the unique topographic characteristics of the area.Mage, J., and Batta, G.

It was released June 1995. The socket supersedes the earlier Socket 5, and accepts P5 Pentium microprocessors manufactured by Intel, as well as compatibles made by Cyrix/IBM, AMD, IDT and others. Socket 7 was the only socket that supported a wide range of CPUs from different manufacturers and a wide range of speeds. Differences between Socket 5 and Socket 7 are that Socket 7 has an extra pin and is designed to provide dual split rail voltage, as opposed to Socket 5's single voltage. (However, not all motherboard manufacturers supported the dual voltage on their boards initially.) Socket 7 is backwards compatible; a Socket 5 CPU can be placed in a Socket 7 motherboard. Processors that used Socket 7 are the AMD K5 and K6, the Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX, the IDT WinChip, the Intel P5 Pentium (2.5‚Äì3.5 V, 75‚Äì200 MHz), the Pentium MMX (166‚Äì233 MHz), and the Rise Technology mP6. Socket 7 typically uses a 321-pin (arranged as 19 by 19 pins) SPGA ZIF socket or the very rare 296-pin (arranged as 37 by 37 pins) SPGA LIF socket. The size is 1.95\\" x 1.95\\" (4.95 cm x 4.95 cm).

Accessed on line November 23, 2010. Properties Beta Arietis has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.66. Based on parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of from Earth. This is a spectroscopic binary star system consisting of a pair of stars orbiting around each other with a separation that can not currently be resolved with a conventional telescope. However, the pair have been resolved using the Mark III Stellar Interferometer at the Mount Wilson Observatory. This allows the orbital elements to be computed, as well as the individual masses of the two stars. The stars complete their highly elliptical orbit every 107 days. The primary star has a stellar classification of A5 V, which means it is an A-type main-sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in its core region. The NStars project gives the star a spectral type of kA4 hA5 mA5 Va under the revised MK spectral classification system. The spectrum of the secondary star has not been determined, but, based on the mass, it may have a stellar classification of F5 III‚ÄìV or G0 V. It is about four magnitudes fainter than the primary; hence the energy output from the system is dominated by the primary star. In a few million years, as the primary evolves toward a red giant, significant amounts of mass transfer to the secondary component is expected. The primary has been classified as a rapid rotator, with a projected rotational velocity of 73 km/s providing a lower bound on the azimuthal rotational velocity along the equator. It may also be a mildly Am star, which is a class of stars that show a peculiar spectrum with strong absorption lines from various elements and deficiencies in others. In Œ≤ Arietis, these absorption lines are broadened because of the Doppler effect from the rotation, making analysis of the abundance patterns difficult. This system has been examined with the Spitzer Space Telescope for the presence of an excess emission of infrared, which would indicate a disk of dust. However, no significant excess was detected.

The inspiration and design of both the VP Exakta and the Kine Exakta are the work of the Ihagee engineer Karl N√ºchterlein (see Richard Hummel's Spiegelreflexkameras aus Dresden), who did not survive the Second World War. Characteristics Highlights of Exakta cameras include: * First single-lens reflex camera (SLR) for 127 roll film (VP Exakta) came in 1933 * First wind-on lever in 1934 * First built-in flash socket, activated by the shutter, in 1935 * First SLR for 35mm film came in 1936, the Kine Exakta Early Kine Exaktas had a fixed waist-level viewfinder, but later models, starting with the Exakta Varex, had an interchangeable waist- or eye-level finder. Examat and Travemat through-the-lens metering prisms were introduced in the mid-1960s. Most controls‚Äîincluding the shutter release and the film wind lever‚Äîare on the left-hand side, unlike most other cameras. The film is transported in the opposite direction to other 35mm SLRs. In classic Exaktas‚Äîmade between 1936 and 1969‚Äîtwo film canisters thumb can be used, one containing unexposed film and a second into which is wound the exposed film. A sliding knife built into the bottom of the camera can be used to slice the film so that the canister containing the exposed film can be removed while preserving the unexposed film in the main canister. The knife was omitted in the Exakta VX500, one of the last \\"official\\" Exakta cameras. The shutter release on classic Exaktas is on the front of the camera, rather than the top. It is pressed with the left forefinger. This is quite similar to the Praktina design (which adapted it from Ihagee's product), the shutter-release of which was located on the right- hand side of the camera-body front. Most later lenses produced for Exakatas (Ihagee did not produce their own lenses), known either as \\"automatic\\" or \\"semi-automatic\\" lenses, included a button in an extension that would align over the camera body's shutter release when the lens was mounted. The diaphragm of these lenses remained fully open, providing a bright viewfinder image, until the button was depressed halfway, when the iris would be stopped down to the shooting aperture; pressed farther, the lens button engaged the camera's shutter release button, tripping the shutter. bellows and slide copier There was a full line of specialized equipment available for these system cameras that included microscope adaptor, extension bellows, stereo attachments, medical attachments and various specialized finder screens. Equipment is fully compatible between all models manufactured between 1936 and 1969. The spelling found on cameras has traditionally been Exakta, but some early Kine-Exaktas were marked Exacta specifically for marketing in France, Portugal and the U.S., perhaps for copyright reasons; and certainly a great number of American collectors refer to the whole range as the \\"Exacta.\\" A related line of smaller, simpler cameras was the \\"Exa\\" line; these, too, existed in several variations. The Beseler Topcon line of 35mm cameras used the same lens mount as the Exakta. In the early 1970s the Exakta \\"RTL 1000\\" was introduced; it accepted the older models' lenses but had its own range of viewfinders, which included a model with through-the-lens light metering. M42 lens mount variants of the RTL line of cameras also appeared under the Practica name. After an economic collapse following Germany's reunification, the successor of the firm (Pentacon, which subsumed Ihagee) is now back in business. This company is not related to the Dutchman Johan Steenbergen, the founder of Ihagee, or with the Exakta, which was discontinued in the 1970s.

He gained the world speed record on land and on water at various times during the 1920s and 1930s using vehicles called Blue Bird, including a 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeam. His son, Donald Campbell, carried on the family tradition by holding both land speed and water speed records. Early life and family Campbell was born in Chislehurst, Kent. on 11 March 1885, the only son of William Campbell, a Hatton Garden diamond seller. He attended the independent Uppingham School. In Germany, learning the diamond trade, he gained an interest in motorbikes and races. Returning to Britain, he worked for two years at Lloyd's of London for no pay, then for another year at ¬£1 a week. Between 1906 and 1908, he won all three London to Lands End Trials motorcycle races. In 1910 he began racing cars at Brooklands. He christened his car Blue Bird, painting it blue, after seeing the play The Blue Bird by Maurice Maeterlinck at the Haymarket Theatre. Campbell married Marjorie Dagmar Knott in 1913 but divorced two years later. Campbell then married Dorothy Evelyn Whittall in 1920 and their son Donald was born in 1921, and their daughter, Jean, in 1923. They divorced in 1940. Campbell married Betty Nicory in 1945 in Chelsea. Military service At the outbreak of World War I, Campbell initially enlisted as a motorcycle dispatch rider and fought at the Battle of Mons in August 1914. Shortly afterwards he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment), a Territorial Force unit, on 2 September 1914. He was soon drafted into the Royal Flying Corps, where he served as a ferry pilot, as his instructors believed he was too clumsy to make the grade as a fighter pilot. During the late 1930s he commanded the provost company of the 56th (London) Division of the Territorial Army. From 1940 to 1942 he commanded the military police contingent of the Coats Mission tasked with evacuating King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and their immediate family from London in the event of German invasion. On 23 January 1943 he was transferred from the Corps of Military Police to the General List. On 16 December 1945, having attained the age limit of 60, Campbell relinquished his commission and was granted the honorary rank of major. Grand Prix career Campbell competed in Grand Prix motor racing, winning the 1927 and 1928 Grand Prix de Boulogne in France driving a Bugatti T37A. Land speed record Campbell broke the land speed record for the first time in 1924 at at Pendine Sands near Carmarthen Bay in a 350HP V12 Sunbeam, now on display at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. He broke nine land speed records between 1924 and 1935, with three at Pendine Sands and five at Daytona Beach. His first two records were driving a racing car built by Sunbeam. On 4 February 1927 Campbell set the land speed record at Pendine Sands, covering the Flying Kilometre (in an average of two runs) at and the Flying Mile in , in the Napier-Campbell Blue Bird.Motor Sport, March 1927, p.282; Motor Sport, September 1927, p.77; Thrust, by Richard Noble (Bantam Books, 1999), p. 401. He set his final land speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah on 3 September 1935, and was the first person to drive an automobile over 300 mph, averaging in two passes. Water speed records Campbell developed and flotation-tested Blue Bird on Tilgate Lake, in Tilgate Park, Crawley. He set the water speed record four times, his highest speed being in the Blue Bird K4. He set the record on 19 August 1939 on Coniston Water, Cumbria, England. Politics Campbell stood for Parliament without success at the 1935 general election in Deptford for the Conservative Party, despite his links to the British Union of Fascists.Julie V. Gottlieb, \\"British Union of Fascists (act. 1932‚Äì1940)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 (Accessed 5 February 2014) Reportedly, he once adorned his car with a Fascist pennant of the London Volunteer Transport Service, though there has been no photographic evidence to support this claim.Zander, Patrick Glenn.

Campbell died after a series of strokes in 1948 in Reigate, Surrey, aged 63 years. He was one of the few land speed record holders of his era to die of natural causes, as so many had died in crashes.

It is a civil parish which, according to the 2011 census, had a population of 532 and is in the LS21 postcode district with Otley as its post town. It is in the Otley ward of the City of Leeds, and the Leeds North West parliamentary constituency. Geography The village is a small collection of dwellings and farms along the A659 road (Arthington Lane) running from Pool-in-Wharfedale in the West to Harewood in the East, and south of a section of the River Wharfe. Up Black Hill Road to the south is a working stone quarry. Etymology The name Arthington is first attested in the Domesday Book as Hardinctone, Ardintona and Ardinton. The first element of the name comes from the Old English personal name Eard, a nickname form of longer names like Eardwulf; the connecting element -ing-, used to indicate Eard's association with the place; and the word t≈´n ('farmstead, estate'). Thus the name meant 'Eard's estate'. Spellings with th for d appear from the twelfth century onwards and are thought to show the influence of Old Norse pronunciation on the name.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place- Names Society, 2017), pp. 18-19. History Arthington was part of the estate of Aluuard of Northumbria, along with Adel, Burdon, Cookridge and Eccup, up until the Norman conquest of England. It was then given to the Count of Mortain (half brother of William the Conqueror). However, it had greatly reduced in value during the Conquest, falling from 30 shillings to 5, and much of the area was described as waste. It was in the 12th century that Arthington (or Ardington) as a family name was established, as vassals to the tenant in chief, the Paynel and later the Luterel family. Peter de Arthington donated lands at Arthington to Kirkstall Abbey which led to the establishment of a nunnery known as Arthington Priory. The site is now believed to be occupied by Nunnery Farm, with the main house dated 1585 built from the ruins. By this time the region had improved with more land under agriculture and more inhabitants. Buildings The village mainly extends from the Wharfdale pub at the western end to the former parish church of St Peter on the eastern end. This dates from 1864 and is a Grade II Listed building like many others in the village. It became redundant because of the small congregation, and in 2007 it was renamed St Mary and St Abanoub as a Coptic Orthodox church.Iklely Gazette, 21 June 2007 Little known church brings worship back to the village It serves a congregation living in West, North and East Yorkshire. Arthington Hall was the home of the Arthington family from Norman times till the 18th century when it was taken over by the Sheepshank family who rebuilt in Italianate style and also paid for the church. It has been used for filming the UK TV series Heartbeat. To the West of the village is Creskeld Hall, a former Manor house, which has been used for filming the external shots of Home Farm in the TV serial Emmerdale. The village was the site of Arthington Priory, one of only two Cluniac nunneries in England - the other being at Delapr√© Abbey in Northampton. The site is now believed to be occupied by Nunnery Farm, with the main house dated 1585 built from the ruins. Railway There used to be a railway junction (see Arthington railway station), where the (now-closed) line to Pool-in-Wharfedale station, Otley station, Ilkley station, and on to Skipton station joined the still open Harrogate Line from Leeds to Harrogate station. Arthington station closed completely in 1965 but there is a campaign to re-open the station and the former Otley line. The village is at the northern end of the Bramhope Tunnel. The railway then crosses the dramatic stone Arthington Viaduct over the River Wharfe to Castley on the north side of the valley. The Arthington Show is actually held on grounds in Castley.

It is traditionally called the \\"King of Terriers\\" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds. The Airedale was bred from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now known as the Welsh Terrier), the Otterhound and probably some other Terrier breeds, and has contributed to other dog breeds, such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Originally bred to serve as a versatile hunting and all around working farm dog, in Britain this breed has also been used as a war dog, guide dog and police dog. In the United States, this breed has been used to hunt big game, upland birds, and water fowl, and serve in many other working capacities. Description Airedale =Appearance= dog show. The Airedale is the largest of the British terriers. They weigh in fit condition and have a height at the withers of for males, with females slightly smaller. The American Kennel Club standard specifies a very slightly smaller dog. Larger Airedales, up to can sometimes be found in North America. They are sometimes referred to as \\"Oorangs\\" as this was the name of a kennel in Ohio in the early 1900s that produced this much larger variation, or Roosevelt Terriers. The Airedale has a medium-length black and tan coat with a harsh topcoat and a soft undercoat. They are an alert and energetic breed, \\"not aggressive but fearless.\\" It has been claimed that the larger \\"Oorang\\" type Airedales are more eager than the smaller, breed standard Airedales, but this is not necessarily so. The large type have been used for big game hunting and as family guardians or as pets, but usually do poorly in AKC (American Kennel Club) conformation shows. This larger type is also significantly more prone to hip dysplasia than the standard Airedales. Coat Like many terriers, the breed has a 'broken' coat, which is hard and wiry. It is meant to be kept not so long as to appear ragged, and lies straight and close, covering body and legs. The outer coat is hard, wiry and stiff, the undercoat softer. The hardest coats are crinkly or just slightly waved. Curly soft coats are highly undesirable. The coat is hypoallergenic, tending not to generate allergic reactions in people. Airedales bearing undercoats are generally groomed by hand stripping where a small serrated edged knife is used to pull out loose hair from the dog's coat. Most Airedales require frequent (6 to 8 weeks) clipping or stripping as they do not shed. The AKC breed standard states that the correct coat color is either a black saddle, with a tan head, ears and legs; or a dark grizzle saddle (black mixed with gray and white). Grizzle that is a mix of red hair in the black, often on the area of back before the tail are often the best and harshest coats. There are, however, examples of non- standard black-coated and \\"red\\" (tan) coated Airedales, (the solid colored Airedales are NOT able to be AKC registered, since they are deviations from breed standard and have yet to be proven 'purebred' Airedale Terriers.) There are also the short coated \\"Redline\\" type Airedales, they appear to be genetic throwbacks in looks to the Airedale's early days when the breed's coats were much shorter than today's Airedale. Even with their shorter coat they still have the same hard wiry outer coat with a soft under coat and fall well within the criteria of the breed standard and therefore can be AKC registered and most are registered. Tail This Airedale's tail is natural (undocked) Traditionally the fluffy tail is long and erect. In most European countries and Australia it is illegal to dock dogs' tails unless it is for the dog's benefit (e.g., if the tail is broken). This has resulted in the emergence of a spitz tail in some dogs. Selective breeding should see this change over time and the required slightly curled tail set high on the back again become common. In other parts of the world the Airedale's tail is commonly docked within five days of birth, but this is not considered a breed standard custom. To show an Airedale in the United States, the official AKC standard states \\"The root of the tail should be set well up on the back. It should be carried gaily but not curled over the back. It should be of good strength and substance and of fair length.\\" Size Airedales weigh approximately 50-80 pounds, being active and agile enough to perform well, while not too small to function as a physical deterrent, retriever or hunter. Some breeders have produced larger Airedale Terriers, such as the 'Oorang Airedale', developed in the 1920s. Ex-Army captain and Airdale breeder Walter Lingo's monthly magazine \\"Oorang Comments\\" (#25, page 81), stated that \\"When full grown your Airedale dog will weigh from forty to fifty-five pounds and if a female will weigh slightly less. This is the standard weight, but when required, we can furnish oversized Airedales whose weight will be from sixty to one hundred pounds.\\" Because Lingo tried to fill orders for everyone, the Oorang strain size was never standardized. Airedales weighing from 40 to 100 pounds were produced, but for the most part they were approximately 50 pounds and 22 to 24 inches at the shoulder. In the United States, the male Airedales measure 40 to 70 pounds, with the Oorang strain typically in the 80 to 120 pound range. =Temperament= The Airedale can be used as a working dog and also as a hunting dog. Airedales exhibit some herding characteristics as well, and have a propensity to chase animals. They have no problem working with cattle and livestock. However, an Airedale that is not well trained will agitate and annoy the animals. Airedales have generally long puppyhoods and tend to be more difficult to train in their youth. The Airedale Terrier, like most terriers, has been bred to hunt independently. As a result, the dog is very intelligent, independent, strong-minded, stoic, and can sometimes be stubborn. If children and Airedales are both trained correctly, Airedales can be an excellent choice for a family dog. Airedales can do well with cats and other small animals, especially when they are raised with them. They are also very loyal to their owners. Albert Payson Terhune wrote of the Airedale: \\"Among the mine-pits of the Aire, the various groups of miners each sought to develop a dog which could outfight and outhunt and outthink the other miner's dogs. Tests of the first-named virtues were made in inter-mine dog fights. Bit by bit, thus, an active, strong, heroic, compactly graceful and clever dog was evolved ‚Äì the earliest true form of the Airedale. He is swift, formidable, graceful, big of brain, an ideal chum and guard. ....To his master he is an adoring pal. To marauders he is a destructive lightning bolt.\\" The Airedale Terrier ranks 37th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of above average working dog. Health A young puppy. Airedale Terriers in UK, USA, and Canadian surveys had a median lifespan of about 11.5 years, which is similar to other breeds of their size. In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (39.5%), old age (14%), urologic (9%), and cardiac (7%). In a 2000‚Äì2001 USA/Canada Health Survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (38%), urologic (17%), old age (12%), and cardiac (6%) A very hardy breed, although some may suffer from eye problems, hip dysplasia and skin infections. Airedales can be affected by hip dysplasia. Like most terriers, they have a propensity towards dermatitis. Skin disorders may go unnoticed in Airedales, because of their hard, dense, wiry coats. Itchy skin may be manifest as acral lick dermatitis (also known as lick granuloma; caused by licking one area excessively) or acute moist dermatitis or \\"hot spots\\" (an oppressively itchy, inflamed and oozing patch of skin, made worse by intense licking and chewing). Allergies, dietary imbalances, and under/over-productive thyroid glands are the main causes of skin conditions. An Airedale's coat was originally designed to protect the dog from its predators‚Äîthe coat was designed to come out in the claws of the predator the dog was designed to hunt, leaving the dog unharmed. Because of this, some forms of skin dermatitis can respond to hand stripping the coat. Clipping the coat cuts the dead hair, leaving dead roots within the hair follicles. It is these dead roots which can cause skin irritations. However, hand stripping removes these dead roots from the skin and stimulates new growth. Gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, affects Airedale Terriers. The stomach can twist and block the esophagus, causing a buildup of gas and leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Signs of bloat include gastric distress (stomach pain), futile attempts at vomiting, and increased salivation. Bloat usually occurs when the dog is exercised too soon after eating. They will eat up to 4-6 cups of food at a time. Due to the breed's stoic nature, injuries can go unnoticed for a time as the dog will not give obvious signs of pain or distress like whining. For example, the first indication of a cut on the foot might be limping or favoring that foot a few days after the actual injury, so owners should be aware of their pets usual movement to spot irregularities. Excessive licking of a spot may also indicate a problem other than the skin conditions listed above. History Thunder, a Bingley Terrier and one of the founders of the Airedale Terrier, from The Illustrated Book of the Dog, London/New York 1881 Airedale, a valley (dale) in the West Riding of Yorkshire, named for the River Aire that runs through it, was the birthplace of the breed. In the mid-19th century, working-class people created the Airedale Terrier by crossing the old English rough-coated Black and Tan Terrier with the Otterhound and an assortment of other breeds. In 1886, the Kennel Club of England formally recognized the Airedale Terrier breed. In 1864 they were exhibited for the first time at a championship dog show sponsored by the Airedale Agricultural Society. They were classified under different names, including Rough Coated, Bingley and Waterside Terrier. In 1879 breed fanciers decided to call the breed the Airedale Terrier, a name accepted by the Kennel Club (England) in 1886. Well-to-do hunters of the era were typically accompanied by a pack of hounds and several terriers, often running them both together. The hounds would scent and pursue the quarry and the terriers would \\"go to ground\\" or enter into the quarry's burrow and make the kill. Terriers were often the sporting dog of choice for the common man. Early sporting terriers needed to be big enough to tackle the quarry, but not so big as to prevent them from maneuvering through the quarry's underground lair. As a result, these terriers had to have a very high degree of courage and pluck to face the foe in a tight, dark underground den without the help of human handlers. Airedale Terrier circa 1915 During the middle of the 19th century, regular sporting events took place along the River Aire in which terriers pursued the large river rats that inhabited the area. A terrier was judged on its ability to locate a \\"live\\" hole in the riverbank and then, after the rat was driven from its hole by a ferret brought along for that purpose, the terrier would pursue the rat through water until it could make a kill. As these events became more popular, demand arose for a terrier that could excel in this activity. One such terrier was developed through judicious crossings of the Black-and-Tan Terrier and bull and terrier dogs popular at the time with the Otter Hound. The result was a long-legged fellow that would soon develop into the dog we recognize today as the Airedale Terrier. This character was too big to \\"go to ground\\" in the manner of the smaller working terriers; however, it was good at everything else expected of a sporting terrier, and it was particularly adept at water work. This big terrier had other talents in addition to its skill as a ratter. Because of its hound heritage it was well equipped to pick up the scent of game and due to its size, able to tackle larger animals. It became more of a multipurpose terrier that could pursue game by powerful scenting ability, be broken to gun, and taught to retrieve. Its size and temperament made it an able guardian of farm and home. One of the colorful, but less-than legal, uses of the early Airedale Terrier was to assist its master in poaching game on the large estates that were off-limits to commoners. Rabbits, hare, and fowl were plentiful, and the Airedale could be taught to retrieve game killed by its master, or to pursue, kill, and bring it back itself. The first imports of Airedale Terriers to North America were in the 1880s. The first Airedale to come to American shores was named Bruce. After his 1881 arrival, Bruce won the terrier class in a New York dog show. An Airedale sitting The patriarch of the breed is considered to be CH Master Briar (1897‚Äì1906). Two of his sons, Crompton Marvel and Monarch, also made important contributions to the breed. The first Canadian registrations are recorded in the Stud book of 1888‚Äì1889. In 1910, the ATCA (Airedale Terrier Club of America) offered the Airedale Bowl as a perpetual trophy, which continues to this day. It is now mounted on a hardwood pedestal base, holding engraved plates with the names of the hundreds of dogs that have been awarded Best of Breed at the National Specialties. The Airedale was extensively used in World War I to carry messages to soldiers behind enemy lines and transport mail. They were also used by the Red Cross to find wounded soldiers on the battlefield. There are numerous tales of Airedales delivering their messages despite terrible injury. An Airedale named \\"Jack\\" ran through half a mile of enemy fire, with a message attached within his collar. He arrived at headquarters with his jaw broken and one leg badly splintered, and right after he delivered the message, he dropped dead in front of its recipient. Lieutenant Colonel Edwin Hautenville Richardson was responsible for the development of messenger and guard dogs in the British Army. He, along with his wife, established the British War Dog School at Shoeburyness in Essex, England. In 1916, they provided two Airedales (Wolf & Prince) for use as message carriers. After both dogs proved themselves in battle, Airedales were given more duties, such as locating injured soldiers on the battlefield, an idea taken from the Red Cross. Before the adoption of the German Shepherd as the dog of choice for law enforcement and search and rescue work, the Airedale terrier often filled this role. In 1906, Richardson tried to interest the British Police in using dogs to accompany officers, for protection on patrol at night. Mr. Geddes, Chief Goods Manager for Hull Docks in Yorkshire, was convinced after he went and saw the impressive work of police dogs in Belgium. Geddes convinced Superintendent Dobie of the North Eastern Railway Police, to arrange a plan for policing the docks. Airedale Terriers were selected for duty as police dogs because of their intelligence, good scenting abilities and their hard, wiry coats that were easy to maintain and clean. They were trained in Hull to attack people not in uniform which could cause problems for their handlers when off duty. The first four dogs began patrols in Hull Docks in 1908, and the scheme was later extended to other docks policed by the North Eastern Railway Police. At the beginning of the Russo- Japanese war in 1904, the Russian embassy in London contacted Lt. Colonel Richardson for help acquiring dogs for the Russian Army, trained to take the wounded away from the battlefields. He sent terriers, mostly Airedale Terriers, for communication and sanitary services. Although these original imports perished, Airedale Terriers were reintroduced to Russia in the early 1920s for use by the Red Army. Special service dog units were created in 1923, and Airedale Terriers were used as demolition dogs, guard dogs, police tracking dogs and casualty dogs. John Jacob Astor IV with his Terrier Kitty Two Airedales were among the dogs lost with the sinking of the RMS Titanic. The Airedale \\"Kitty\\" belonged to Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, the real-estate mogul, who also died in the sinking. The second Airedale belonged to William E. Carter of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Carter, his wife and two children survived the sinking. During the 1930s, when airedales were farmed like livestock, a few American breeders developed the Oorang Airedale offshoot. Capt. Walter Lingo, of LaRue, Ohio, developed the Oorang Airedale strain. The name came from a line of bench champions, headed by King Oorang 11, a dog which was said to have been the finest utility dog. King could retrieve waterfowl and upland game, tree raccoons, drive cattle and sheep, and bay mountain lions, bears, and wolves. King even fought one of the best fighting bull terriers, and killed his opponent. He also trained in Red Cross work, and served the American Expeditionary Force at the front in France. Lingo simply wasn't satisfied with the average strain of Airedale, and after an incredible series of breedings, for which he brought in great Airedales from all over the world, he created the \\"King Oorang.\\" At the time, Field and Stream magazine called it, \\"the greatest utility dog in the history of the world.\\" The Oorang Kennel Company continued until Walter Lingo's death in 1969. To help promote the King Oorang, as well as his kennels, Lingo created the Oorang Indians football team headed up by Jim Thorpe. The team played in National Football League from 1922‚Äì1923. Jerry Siebert, an Airedale breeder in Buckeye Lake, Ohio, followed in Lingo's footsteps, and bred \\"Jerang Airedales.\\" There is a kennel in Tennessee that claims to have original Oorang Airedales. After the First World War, the Airedales' popularity rapidly increased thanks to stories of their bravery on the battlefield After the First World War, the Airedales' popularity rapidly increased thanks to stories of their bravery on the battlefield and also because Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, and Warren Harding owned Airedales. President Harding's Airedale, Laddie Boy, was the \\"first celebrity White House pet\\". President Harding had a special chair hand carved for him to sit on at very important Cabinet meetings. In the 1920s, the Airedale became the most popular breed in the USA. President Roosevelt claimed that \\"An Airedale can do anything any other dog can do and then lick the other dog, if he has to.\\" 1949 marked the peak of the Airedales' popularity in the USA, ranked 20th out of 110 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club. The Airedale Terrier was recognized by United Kennel Club in 1914. The Airedale Terrier was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1888. The Airedale Terrier Club of America (ATCA), founded in 1900 is the parent club of the breed in the United States and the official-spokes organization for the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC). The Airedale Terrier Club of America periodically holds performance and conformation events. The Airedale judged to be Best of Breed at these national specialty shows is awarded the Airedale Bowl.

During this golden age, the Kansai region would give birth to traditional Japanese culture. In 788, Saicho, the founder of the Tendai sect of Buddhism established his monastery at Mount Hiei in Shiga prefecture. Japan's most famous tale, and some say the world's first novel, The Tale of Genji was penned by Murasaki Shikibu while performing as a lady-in-waiting in Heian-kyo. Noh and Kabuki, Japan's traditional dramatic forms both saw their birth and evolution in Kyoto, while Bunraku, Japanese puppet theater, is native to Osaka.

Outside of Tokyo and Yokoyama, Kansai has the largest number of international schools. In 1909, Deutsche Schule Kobe was founded to serve German, Austrian and German-speaking Swiss expatriates, traders and missionaries living in the Kobe area. After a long history of teaching a German curriculum, the school changed to The Primary Years Programme (PYP) in 2002. Today, Deutsche Schule Kobe/European School provides curriculum in three languages: German, English, and Japanese. In 1913, Canadian Methodist Academy opened its doors to sixteen children. The school, renamed Canadian Academy in 1917, served children of missionary parents from grade one through high school and offered boarding facilities for students from throughout Asia. Today, the day and boarding school offers a PreK to Grade 12 education on the campus on Rokk≈ç Island, a man-made island. The school, which is no longer affiliated with Canada or the church, is the largest school for expatriates in Kansai. The school is approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education and accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the Council of International Schools. The school awards both the International Baccalaureate (IB) and U.S. high school diplomas. The number of international schools burgeoned after World War II. In 1946, St. Michael's International School was established by Anglican Bishop Michael Yashiro and Miss Leonora Lee, a British missionary. Today, the school offers a distinctive British-style primary education based on the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The school has joint accreditation from the Council of International Schools and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Brother Charles Fojoucyk and Brother Stephen Weber founded Marist Brothers International School in 1951 after communist authorities pressured them to leave Tientsin, China. Today, the international Montessori - Grade 12 school enrolls approximately 300 students. The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In 1957, a missionary homeschooled her son, his best friend and another student in their home. The next year, the home turned into Kyoto Christian Day School and a full-time teacher was hired. The school was renamed Kyoto International School in 1966. Today, the school serves students from two to fourteen years old. The school has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) since 1992 and authorized by the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) since 2006. Kansai is also served by Osaka International School, Lyc√©e fran√ßais international de Kyoto as well as Chinese and Korean schools.

The relational calculus is similar to the relational algebra, which is also part of the relational model: While the relational calculus is meant as a declarative language which prescribes no execution order on the subexpressions of a relational calculus expression, the relational algebra is meant as an imperative language: the sub-expressions of a relational algebraic expressions are meant to be executed from left-to-right and inside-out following their nesting. A relational algebra expression might prescribe the following steps to retrieve the phone numbers and names of book stores that supply Some Sample Book: # Join book stores and titles over the BookstoreID. # Restrict the result of that join to tuples for the book Some Sample Book. # Project the result of that restriction over StoreName and StorePhone. A relational calculus expression would formulate this query in the following descriptive or declarative manner: :Get StoreName and StorePhone for book stores such that there exists a title BK with the same BookstoreID value and with a BookTitle value of Some Sample Book. The relational algebra and the relational calculus are logically equivalent: for any algebraic expression, there is an equivalent expression in the calculus, and vice versa. This result is known as Codd's theorem. The raison d'√™tre of the relational calculus is the formalization of query optimization. Query optimization consists in determining from a query the most efficient manner (or manners) to execute it. Query optimization can be formalized as translating a relational calculus expression delivering an answer A into efficient relational algebraic expressions delivering the same answer A.

It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Robert Pollard. The most well-known lineup of the band consisted of Pollard (lead vocals), his brother Jim (guitar, bass), Mitch Mitchell (lead guitars), Tobin Sprout (vocals, rhythm guitars), Kevin Fennell (drums), and bassist Greg Demos. Noted at first for their lo-fi aesthetic and typically Portastudio four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music was influenced by early post‚ÄìBritish Invasion garage rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, punk rock and post-punk. Due to their prolific output, releasing 30 full-length albums along with many other releases, they have garnered a dedicated cult following with songs that are in the two-minute range, with many which are even shorter. Their songs are also known for ending abruptly or intertwining with odd and homemade sound effects. Guided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the \\"classic\\" lineup reunited to perform at Matador Records 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016. History =Early years (1983‚Äì1991)= Formed in Dayton, Ohio, in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene. As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation. Guided by Voices' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. Forever Since Breakfast and followed by the albums Devil Between My Toes, Sandbox, Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia, and Same Place The Fly Got Smashed. With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members' family and friends. =Lo-fi (1992‚Äì1996)= With the release of the ultra-limited album Propeller in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the college rock circuit and bands such as Sonic Youth, R.E.M. and The Breeders. New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993. At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists Tobin Sprout and Mitch Mitchell (not to be confused with Jimi Hendrix's drummer), bassist Greg Demos, and drummer Kevin Fennell. Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa Propeller and soon became Pollard's primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band's catalog. 1993 also saw the release of Vampire on Titus, as well as the Fast Japanese Spin Cycle and Static Airplane Jive EPs. Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as Spin magazine. In 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV's history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark Bee Thousand via Scat Records, with a distribution deal through indie label Matador Records. Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time. The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard's homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, Roger Daltrey-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands), Mitch Mitchell's windmilling and chain smoking, sometime bassist Greg Demos' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around. Their true Matador debut came in 1995 with Alien Lanes, which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap. The band's underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as MTV and Rolling Stone. Guided by Voices is frequently referenced by novelist and poet, Dennis Cooper, in his George Miles cycle and the group's lyrics appear in Guide, the fourth of the five novels which make up the cycle. The first chapter of Guide is titled \\"Guided by Voices\\". After sessions for a concept album entitled The Power of Suck were aborted, the band assembled Under the Bushes Under the Stars out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with Kim Deal and Steve Albini among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \\"classic lineup\\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career. Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout's Carnival Boy and Pollard's Not in My Airforce, with each making a guest appearance on the other's album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band's existence. These records were primarily self-released. Because GBV alumni were regularly featured, and songs from these albums were frequently included in GBV set lists, they are informally considered to be part of the GBV canon. Also in 1995, the band contributed the song \\"Sensational Gravity Boy\\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization. =Major label (1997‚Äì2001)= Pollard created a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with Cleveland glam rockers Cobra Verde in 1997. The following album Mag Earwhig!, combined a new hard- rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \\"Jane of the Waking Universe\\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time. However, after another year of rigorous touring, the \\"Guided by Verde\\" lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project. Cobra Verde's Doug Gillard was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \\"classic\\"-era bassist Greg Demos, former Breeders drummer Jim Macpherson, and eventually, former Amps/Breeders guitarist Nate Farley. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer Ric Ocasek to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices' major label debut. Initially produced for Capitol Records, Do the Collapse was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label TVT. (In the UK it was released on Creation Records). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, Do the Collapse failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews. Through touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of The Who, David Bowie and The Rolling Stones, all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption. In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band's first and only visits to Australia and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive Suitcase, a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard's enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Three more box sets of unreleased songs, Suitcase 2, Suitcase 3 and Suitcase 4 released in October 2005, November 2009 and November 2015 respectively.) 2001's Isolation Drills was recorded with Rob Schnapf, who aimed to capture the band's live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in Billboard's top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough. =Later years (2002‚Äì2004)= 255x255px After departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released Universal Truths and Cycles, a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band's mid-90s, mid-fi aesthetic. Universal Truths producer Todd Tobias would also record the band's final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled Earthquake Glue, followed by the anthology box set Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere and the greatest hits compilation Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates. In 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices following the release of the Half-Smiles of the Decomposed LP, and a final farewell tour. Pollard stated: :\\"This feels like the last album for Guided by Voices. I've always said that when I make a record that I'm totally satisfied with as befitting a final album, then that will be it. And this is it.\\" Guided by Voices would go on to release no less than 15 more studio albums (since Surrender Your Poppy Field). On November 9, 2004, Guided by Voices performed on the stage of Austin City Limits, broadcast by PBS on January 22, 2005. Their last television appearance was on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on December 2, 2004. They played the single, \\"Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)\\". After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004. The four-hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD The Electrifying Conclusion. =Post-GBV (2005‚Äì2009)= Pollard released his first post-GBV album in 2006 on Merge Records. The album, titled From a Compound Eye was a double LP produced by Todd Tobias. Later Pollard albums have been released on Merge and Pollard's own label, Guided by Voices Inc. Following GBV's demise, Pollard was frequently asked about band reunions. In 2007 he told MAGNET: \\"To me, it‚Äôs just cashing in. If you‚Äôre gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That‚Äôs like doing the county-fair circuit. I don‚Äôt see Guided By Voices reforming. For one thing, there were 50 or 60 people in Guided By Voices over time.\\" Pollard also commented on the fact that GBV and his solo output are basically the same, when he told Harp magazine, in 2005, \\"You know, a lot of people try to distinguish things between what is Robert Pollard and what is Guided By Voices. I tell them basically that there is no difference; I am Robert Pollard and I am Guided By Voices.\\" In 2008, Pollard admitted to almost bringing GBV back for his album Robert Pollard Is Off to Business but decided against it, instead forming a new label titled Guided by Voices Inc. The 1998‚Äì1999 lineup of the band reunited for a few songs, for Pollard's 50th birthday in 2007. In October 2008, it was announced that Guided by Voices' music would be used for a 3-D film musical based on the life of Cleopatra to be directed by Steven Soderbergh with script by James Greer. Soderbergh and Greer would rewrite the lyrics of the songs to fit the story. Soderbergh had previously used a Guided by Voices song in his film Full Frontal, and wrote an introduction to a book on the band. Pollard wrote the soundtrack to Soderbergh's film Bubble, and that music was released as Music for 'Bubble'. Guided by Voices and Pollard posters, t-shirts, and songs appeared frequently on British sit-com The IT Crowd.The IT Crowd Guided By Voices performing in 2014 =Reunion (2010‚Äì2014)= In June 2010, Matador Records announced that the \\"Classic '93‚Äì'96 Lineup\\" would reunite to perform at the label's 21st Anniversary celebration in Las Vegas, in October of that year. A full reunion tour was subsequently announced, with the band selling out nearly every date. The tour included stops at Hoboken's Maxwell's and the Southgate House in Newport, Kentucky, two venues that the band had built a history with due to legendary shows there in the past. When asked by Spinner if there might ever be another proper GBV record Pollard said \\"I've thought about it sometimes but it's a very long shot,\\" he says. \\"We all kind of do our own thing. I'm not completely eliminating the possibility.\\" On September 21, 2011, it was announced that a new GBV album, Let's Go Eat the Factory, had been recorded for release in January 2012. On January 4, 2012, the band performed their single \\"The Unsinkable Fats Domino\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote Let's Go Eat the Factory. During their performance, bassist Greg Demos fell while attempting a dance move. However, Demos was not seriously injured and the band continued to perform their song. The band canceled what was to have been their first post-reunion show in the UK at the All Tomorrow's Parties 'I'll Be Your Mirror' festival at Alexandra Palace, London, in May 2012 as well as a planned appearance at the Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona. The band's management denied reports that the cancellations were due to them splitting up again and confirmed they were still working on new material. The band released a second post-reformation LP, Class Clown Spots a UFO, on June 12, 2012. Generally regarded by fans as the best of the latter- years' albums, it marked a return in tenor and quality to this line-up's mid-90s heyday. A third, The Bears for Lunch, followed in November.Exclaim,\\"Guided By Voices Reveal Release Details for 'Class Clown Spots a UFO,' Announce Yet Another New Album,\\" 18 April 2012. Retrieved 18 April 2012. GBV began touring again in September 2012 with a 13 show \\"Tour of the South\\", starting in Dayton, Ohio, on September 8, 2012, which included gigs in Cleveland and Pittsburgh, and stops in North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, New Orleans, Texas (Houston and Austin), Missouri and Kansas, with the final show on September 29, 2012, in St. Louis. Another album, English Little League, was released in 2013. In a July 2013 interview with Magnet magazine, Pollard stated that English Little League could be the final GBV album. However, in September, a fifth reunion record, Motivational Jumpsuit, was confirmed for release on Guided By Voices Inc. and Fire Records in February 2014. A sixth reunion album, Cool Planet, was released on May 13, 2014. On September 18, 2014, GBV abruptly released a statement on Facebook that they had once again disbanded. Remaining tour dates were canceled. =Second reunion (2016‚Äìpresent)= In February 2016, the official Guided By Voices Facebook page announced that GBV has been announced to headline the Sled Island Festival on June 25 and that a \\"strikingly fresh Guided By Voices album in the works,\\" on which Pollard plays all the instruments. Pollard subsequently confirmed the new lineup for the band which would include returning drummer Kevin March along with newcomers guitarist Bobby Bare, Jr., guitarist Nick Mitchell and bassist Mark Shue. At the July 16, 2016 show, guitarist Nick Mitchell was fired from the band, in part for his inability to get along with at least one other member of the band, as well as his unusual demand that Pollard pay for Mitchell's wife to accompany the band on tour, which was refused. Mitchell was replaced by former member Doug Gillard, who subsequently rejoined Guided by Voices permanently later that month. On January 25, 2017, the band announced their first double album August by Cake for release on April 7, 2017 and released a new song, \\"Hiking Skin.\\" The album will also be Robert Pollard's 100th album. On March 10, the band premiered another new song from the upcoming album Dr. Feelgood Falls Off the Ocean. On June 22, 2017, Guided by Voices announced another new album for 2017, titled How Do You Spell Heaven, which was released on August 11. The band also released a new single from the upcoming album Just to Show You. On December 8 of the same year, the band announced another album to be released the following March entitled Space Gun, and released the title track as a single. In 2018, Guided by Voices announced the future release of the double album Zeppelin Over China and Warp and Woof for 2019. They also made their 7\\" single, \\"You Own the Night\\" available for pre-order containing singles from both albums. On October 25, 2019, the band released their album Sweating the Plague.

Academically, he is regarded as one of the foremost authorities on the 17th- century British author and scholar Robert Burton.School of Art However, he is most well known for originating the hoax art movement Disumbrationism. Life and ministry Paul Jordan Smith (his name was not hyphenated until later in life; see below) was born in Wytheville, Virginia. His father, John Wesley Smith, was a Southern Methodist minister who dreamed of starting a college and invested in land in Dade County, Georgia, outside Chattanooga, Tennessee. His wife (the former Lucy Jordan) and son joined him there in 1891, but the venture failed and the family returned to Virginia. While a student at Emory and Henry College, Paul Jordan Smith secretly married Ethel Sloan Park in September 1904. Their daughter Lucille Isabella (Isabel Jordan) Smith was born in August 1905.http://www.parkfamilyreunion.net/Assets/ESPtoPJS.pdf Park Family Network. He graduated from U.S. Grant University in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1906. A local Unitarian minister recommended that he study for the ministry, and although admitted to Harvard Divinity School he enrolled in the more affordable Ryder Divinity School of the Universalist Lombard College in Galesburg, where he received a bachelor of divinity degree in 1908. He served briefly as a minister at Universalist churches in Unionville, Missouri, and Kansas City and developed a reputation as an outstanding lecturer on science and religion. He moved to Chicago in 1910, where he worked at the Independent Religious Society and later got a job as a minister and ran a settlement house. He also enrolled part-time in graduate classes at the University of Chicago and developed a broad acquaintance among both literary and social activist circles, including lawyer Clarence Darrow, activist Emma Goldman, novelist John Cowper Powys, editor and publisher Margaret Anderson, writer Floyd Dell, Chicago Little Theatre founder Maurice Browne, and bookseller George Millard. In the process, he became a passionate book collector and decided on a career in literature. Jordan Smith also developed an interest in art through visits to the Art Institute of Chicago.Crosse, John. \\"The Schindlers and Westons and the Walt Whitman School and Connections to Sarah Bixby Smith and Paul Jordan-Smith\\". Southern California Architectural History website. In 1913 his wife Ethel divorced him and his mother died. After a few months in the South, he traveled to Berkeley, California with letters of introduction, filled in for a minister in Eureka in the summer of 1914, and enrolled as a doctoral student and teaching fellow in the English Department at the University of California, Berkeley. He was hired as a substitute minister of the First Unitarian Church of Berkeley after Arthur Maxson Smith resigned when his wife, the heiress Sarah Bixby Smith, caught him having an affair and sued for divorce. Paul Jordan-Smith became romantically involved with Sarah, a writer, and their involvement became public, to their dismay, before the divorce was final. It was around this time that Paul assumed the hyphenated Jordan-Smith as his last name, in part to disguise his liaison with Sarah, which he feared might damage his academic career. Despite this precaution, the English Department‚Äîthen headed by Charles Mills Gayley‚Äîvoted not to renew his fellowship, putting an end to his plans for an academic career.

II-8 The couple then moved with Sarah's children to her former home in Claremont, California, which had been rented to a school for boys. In 1917, the school's lease ended and they began renovating the house back into a private residence, which they named Erewhon after the Samuel Butler novel. Around this time, they met and subsequently became friends with one of Sarah's cousins, the photographer Edward Weston, who made several photographic portraits of Jordan-Smith. Eventually, the couple moved to a mansion on Los Feliz Boulevard in Los Angeles, where Jordan-Smith had a detached library and writing studio on the property.Starr, Kevin. Material Dreams: Southern California Through the 1920s. Oxford University Press, 1990. Though Jordan-Smith did not have to work (thanks to Sarah's inherited wealth), he lectured around southern California, at women's clubs such as the Friday Morning Club (of which Sarah was later president), at the Ebell Club, and elsewhere. He also taught courses on English and American literature at the new University of California Extension program in Los Angeles. Encouraged by some of the philanthropists who attended his talks, he took on leadership of the recently formed People's Council of America for Peace and Democracy, an antiwar organization. The group did well until its leaders came under attack when the U.S. government began to crack down on antiwar opposition through the Espionage Act of 1917. To avoid prosecution, Jordan-Smith was obliged to give up making antiwar speeches and to swear that he did not have any German affiliations or friends. Jordan-Smith served for a time as the educational director of the Walt Whitman School, a progressive secondary school founded in East Los Angeles in 1919. Jordan-Smith eventually left Sarah for his cousin Dorothy and the couple divorced. He died on June 17, 1971.\\"Sarah Bixby Smith: Author's Work Included a Book on Americanization\\", The New York Times, September 14, 1935.\\"Ex-Times Book Editor Paul Jordan-Smith Dies\\", Los Angeles Times, June 18, 1971.

Jordan-Smith was a great admirer of the 17th-century British author and scholar Robert Burton. He co-edited the first all-English translation (having himself translated all of the Latin quotes) of Burton's magnum opus, The Anatomy of Melancholy, following it up with Bibliographica Burtoniana, which included both a study of Burton and a scholarly key to the sources Burton used in The Anatomy of Melancholy. He collected books relating to Burton, and after Sarah died, he gave the core of his collection to the Claremont Colleges Library in her memory. The Robert Burton Collection, as it is called, includes copies of the first six editions of Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, a copy of the 1927 edition edited by Smith and Floyd Dell, and editions of various Renaissance Latin authors and others cited by Burton.Robert Burton Collection at the Claremont Colleges Library Jordan-Smith also wrote one of the first books on James Joyce, A Key to the Ulysses of James Joyce. He dedicated this book to Powys, who had persuaded him in 1922 to buy a then-rare and expensive first edition of Ulysses during one of Powys's stays at Erewhon, which they then read together.In the Spirit of Powys: New Essays by Denis Lane. Associated University Presses, 1990, p. 40. Inspired by Sarah's ideas, Jordan-Smith collaborated with her on a feminist manifesto entitled The Soul of Woman: An Interpretation of the Philosophy of Feminism. It was published under his name in 1916.‚ÄúHis Place is Doubly Taken.‚Äù Los Angeles Times, March 31, 1916, p. II-8.

His papers are housed in the UCLA Library Special Collections. Disumbrationism Jordan-Smith may be best known today for a hoax that he initiated in 1924, in part out of a dislike of modern art that was evident as far back as 1913, when he saw (and largely rejected) the traveling version of the notorious Armory Show at the Art Institute of Chicago. Giving himself the Russian-sounding pseudonym Pavel Jerdanowitch, Jordan-Smith painted a small group of crudely Postimpressionist canvases that he then entered in art exhibitions around the country as exemplars of a new art movement known as Disumbrationism (i.e. painting without shadows). His canvases were well received on the whole until he got tired of sustaining the role and outed himself to a Los Angeles Times reporter in 1927.Whitaker, Alma. \\"International Art Hoax Bared by Los Angeles Writer.\\" August 14, 1927.\\"Pictures Painted to 'Show Up' the Critics Bring Fame to Mythical Modernistic Artist\\", Lawrence Journal-World, January 27, 1931.

Along with his brother and cousin, Annibale was one of the progenitors, if not founders of a leading strand of the Baroque style, borrowing from styles from both north and south of their native city, and aspiring for a return to classical monumentality, but adding a more vital dynamism. Painters working under Annibale at the gallery of the Palazzo Farnese would be highly influential in Roman painting for decades. Early career Piet√† between 1599 and 1600 Self-portrait Annibale Carracci was born in Bologna, and in all likelihood was first apprenticed within his family. In 1582, Annibale, his brother Agostino and his cousin Ludovico Carracci opened a painters' studio, initially called by some the Academy of the Desiderosi (desirous of fame and learning) and subsequently the Incamminati (progressives; literally \\"of those opening a new way\\"). While the Carraccis laid emphasis on the typically Florentine linear draftsmanship, as exemplified by Raphael and Andrea del Sarto, their interest in the glimmering colours and mistier edges of objects derived from the Venetian painters, notably the works of Venetian oil painter Titian, which Annibale and Agostino studied during their travels around Italy in 1580‚Äì81 at the behest of the elder Caracci Lodovico. This eclecticism was to become the defining trait of the artists of the Baroque Emilian or Bolognese School. In many early Bolognese works by the Carraccis, it is difficult to distinguish the individual contributions made by each. For example, the frescoes on the story of Jason for Palazzo Fava in Bologna (c. 1583‚Äì84) are signed Carracci, which suggests that they all contributed. In 1585, Annibale completed an altarpiece of the Baptism of Christ for the church of Santi Gregorio e Siro in Bologna. In 1587, he painted the Assumption for the church of San Rocco in Reggio Emilia. In 1587‚Äì88, Annibale is known to have had travelled to Parma and then Venice, where he joined his brother Agostino. From 1589 to 1592, the three Carracci brothers completed the frescoes on the Founding of Rome for Palazzo Magnani in Bologna. By 1593, Annibale had completed an altarpiece, Virgin on the throne with St John and St Catherine, in collaboration with Lucio Massari. His Resurrection of Christ also dates from 1593. In 1592, he painted an Assumption for the Bonasoni chapel in San Francesco. During 1593‚Äì94, all three Carraccis were working on frescoes in Palazzo Sampieri in Bologna. Frescoes in Palazzo Farnese Portrait of Giacomo Filippo Turrini Based on the prolific and masterful frescoes by the Carracci in Bologna, Annibale was recommended by the Duke of Parma, Ranuccio I Farnese, to his brother, the Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who wished to decorate the piano nobile of the cavernous Roman Palazzo Farnese. In November‚ÄìDecember 1595, Annibale and Agostino traveled to Rome to begin decorating the Camerino with stories of Hercules, appropriate since the room housed the famous Greco-Roman antique sculpture of the hypermuscular Farnese Hercules. Annibale meanwhile developed hundreds of preparatory sketches for the major work, wherein he led a team painting frescoes on the ceiling of the grand salon with the secular quadri riportati of The Loves of the Gods, or as the biographer Giovanni Bellori described it, Human Love governed by Celestial Love. Although the ceiling is riotously rich in illusionistic elements, the narratives are framed in the restrained classicism of High Renaissance decoration, drawing inspiration from, yet more immediate and intimate, than Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling as well as Raphael's Vatican Logge and Villa Farnesina frescoes. His work would later inspire the untrammelled stream of Baroque illusionism and energy that would emerge in the grand frescoes of Cortona, Lanfranco, and in later decades Andrea Pozzo and Gaulli. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Farnese Ceiling was considered the unrivaled masterpiece of fresco painting for its age. They were not only seen as a pattern book of heroic figure design, but also as a model of technical procedure; Annibale's hundreds of preparatory drawings for the ceiling became a fundamental step in composing any ambitious history painting. Contrast with Caravaggio Carracci's Domine quo vadis? (Jesus and Saint Peter) Piet√† with Sts Francis and Mary Magdalen The 17th- century critic Giovanni Bellori, in his survey entitled Idea, praised Carracci as the paragon of Italian painters, who had fostered a \\"renaissance\\" of the great tradition of Raphael and Michelangelo. On the other hand, while admitting Caravaggio's talents as a painter, Bellori deplored his over- naturalistic style, if not his turbulent morals and persona. He thus viewed the Caravaggisti styles with the same gloomy dismay. Painters were urged to depict the Platonic ideal of beauty, not Roman street-walkers. Yet Carracci and Caravaggio patrons and pupils did not all fall into irreconcilable camps. Contemporary patrons, such as Marquess Vincenzo Giustiniani, found both applied showed excellence in maniera and modeling.Wittkover, p. 57. By the 21st century, observers had warmed to the rebel myth of Caravaggio, and often ignored the profound influence on art that Carracci had. Caravaggio almost never worked in fresco, regarded as the test of a great painter's mettle. On the other hand, Carracci's best works are in fresco. Thus the somber canvases of Caravaggio, with benighted backgrounds, are suited to the contemplative altars, and not to well-lit walls or ceilings such as this one in the Farnese. Wittkower was surprised that a Farnese cardinal surrounded himself with frescoes of libidinous themes, indicative of a \\"considerable relaxation of counter-reformatory morality\\". This thematic choice suggests Carracci may have been more rebellious relative to the often-solemn religious passion of Caravaggio's canvases. Wittkower states Carracci's \\"frescoes convey the impression of a tremendous joie de vivre, a new blossoming of vitality and of an energy long repressed\\". In the 21st century, most connoisseurs making the pilgrimage to the Cerasi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo would ignore Carracci's Assumption of the Virgin altarpiece (1600‚Äì1601) and focus on the flanking Caravaggio works. It is instructive to compare Carracci's AssumptionSee the more adept altarpiece at the Prado (Paintings by Annibale Carracci. Web Gallery of Art, retrieved May 28, 2011) with Caravaggio's Death of the Virgin. Among early contemporaries, Carracci was an innovator. He re- enlivened Michelangelo's visual fresco vocabulary, and posited a muscular and vivaciously brilliant pictorial landscape, which had been becoming progressively crippled into a Mannerist tangle. While Michelangelo could bend and contort the body into all the possible perspectives, Carracci in the Farnese frescoes had shown how it could dance. The \\"ceiling\\"-frontiers, the wide expanses of walls to be frescoed would, for the next decades, be thronged by the monumental brilliance of the Carracci followers, and not Caravaggio's followers. Madonna and Child with Saint Lucy, the Infant Saint John the Baptist and an Angel In the century following his death, to a lesser extent than Bernini and Cortona, Carracci and baroque art in general came under criticism from neoclassic critics such as Winckelmann and even later from the prudish John Ruskin, as well as admirers of Caravaggio. Carracci in part was spared opprobrium because he was seen as an emulator of the highly admired Raphael, and in the Farnese frescoes, attentive to the proper themes such as those of antique mythology. Landscapes, genre art and drawings On July 8, 1595, Annibale completed the painting of Saint Roch Giving Alms, now in Dresden Gem√§ldegalerie. Other significant late works painted by Carracci in Rome include Domine, Quo Vadis? (c. 1602), which reveals a striking economy in figure composition and a force and precision of gesture that influenced on Poussin and through him, the language of gesture in painting. Carracci was remarkably eclectic in thematic, painting landscapes, genre scenes, and portraits, including a series of autoportraits across the ages. He was one of the first Italian painters to paint a canvas wherein landscape took priority over figures, such as his masterful The Flight into Egypt; this is a genre in which he was followed by Domenichino (his favorite pupil) and Claude Lorrain. Carracci's art also had a less formal side that comes out in his caricatures (he is generally credited with inventing the form) and in his early genre paintings, which are remarkable for their lively observation and free handlingsee The Butcher's Shop and his painting of The Beaneater. He is described by biographers as inattentive to dress, obsessed with work: his self-portraits (such as that in Parma) vary in his depiction.see mostra Under a melancholic humor It is not clear how much work Annibale completed after finishing the major gallery in the Palazzo Farnese. In 1606, Annibale signs a Madonna of the bowl. However, in a letter from April 1606, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese bemoans that a \\"heavy melancholic humor\\" prevented Annibale from painting for him. Throughout 1607, Annibale is unable to complete a commission for the Duke of Modena of a Nativity. There is a note from 1608, where in Annibale stipulates to a pupil that he will spend at least two hours a day in his studio. There is little documentation from the man or time to explain why his brush was stilled. Speculation abounds. In 1609, Annibale died and was buried, according to his wish, near Raphael in the Pantheon of Rome. It is a measure of his achievement that artists as diverse as Bernini, Poussin, and Rubens praised his work. Many of his assistants or pupils in projects at the Palazzo Farnese and Herrera Chapel would become among the pre- eminent artists of the next decades, including Domenichino, Francesco Albani, Giovanni Lanfranco, Domenico Viola, Guido Reni, Sisto Badalocchio, and others.

Carraci laid the foundations for the birth of Baroque painting. The preceding sterile Mannerist style had its recovery now in the Baroque painting in the early sixteenth century, succeeding in an original synthesis of the many schools. The paintings of Annibale are inspired by the Venetian pictorial taste and especially the paintings of Paolo Veronese. The work that show traces of it are the Madonna Enthroned with Saint Matthew, a work made for Reggio Emilia and now in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden, and the Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Alexandria (ca. 1575), now preserved at the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice.

She was likely much younger than Socrates, perhaps by as much as 40 years.She must have been young enough to give birth to their three children Plato describes in his writings: In the Apology 34d, the sons are described as quite young: two of them \\"children\\", the other a \\"lad\\"; in Plato's Phaedo 60a, one of them is small enough to be held in his mother's arms. Both dialogues take place when Socrates is supposed to have been 70 years old. Name Xanthippe means \\"yellow horse\\", from \\"blond\\" and \\"horse\\". Hers is one of many Greek personal names with a horse theme (cf. Philippos \\"Friend of Horses\\", Hippocrates \\"Horse-tamer\\" etc.). The hippos in an ancient Greek name often suggested aristocratic heritage.Aristophanes, Clouds 60‚Äì64. Xanthippus, e.g., was the father of Pericles. Also, hippeis, literally \\"horsemen\\" or \\"knights\\", was the name of one of the highest socio-economic classes of Athens. One additional reason for thinking Xanthippe's family was socially prominent was that her eldest son was named Lamprocles instead of \\"Sophroniscus\\" after Socrates' father Sophroniscus: the ancient Greek custom was to name one's first child after the more illustrious of the two grandfathers. Xanthippe's father is believed to have been named Lamprocles. If he was even more well-established in Athenian aristocracy than was Socrates' father, his name would have been the preferred choice for the name of the first-born son.John Burnet 1911, Plato: Phaedo, p. 12. Character The chamberpot episode: Socrates, his Wives and Alcibiades, by Reyer van Blommendael Plato's portrayal of Xanthippe in the Phaedo suggests that she was a devoted wife and mother;Plato. Phaedo, 60a‚Äìb, 116b She is mentioned nowhere else in Plato.Xanthippe does receive mention in two short, apocryphal pieces within the literature ascribed traditionally to Plato but considered generally by scholars to be inauthentic. These come in the Halcyon and the Epigrams. Xenophon, in his Memorabilia, portrays her in much the same light, although he does make Lamprocles complain of her harshness.Xenophon, Memorabilia, 2.2.7‚Äì9 It is only in Xenophon's Symposium where we have Socrates agree that she is (in Antisthenes' words) \\"the hardest to get along with of all the women there are.\\"Xenophon, Symposium, 2.10 Nevertheless, Socrates adds that he chose her precisely because of her argumentative spirit: > It is the example of the rider who wishes to become an expert horseman: > \\"None of your soft-mouthed, docile animals for me,\\" he says; \\"the horse for > me to own must show some spirit\\" in the belief, no doubt, if he can manage > such an animal, it will be easy enough to deal with every other horse > besides. And that is just my case. I wish to deal with human beings, to > associate with man in general; hence my choice of wife. I know full well, if > I can tolerate her spirit, I can with ease attach myself to every human > being else.Xenophon, Symposium 17‚Äì19 [= 2.10] Perhaps this picture of Xanthippe originated with the historical Antisthenes, one of Socrates' pupils, since Xenophon initially puts this view into his mouth. Aelian also depicts her as a jealous shrew in his description of an episode in which she tramples underfoot a large and beautiful cake sent to Socrates by Alcibiades.Aelian, Varia Hist. XI.12 Diogenes La√´rtius tells of other stories involving Xanthippe's supposed abusiveness.Diogenes La√´rtius 2.36‚Äì37 An emblem book print portraying Xanthippe emptying a chamber pot over Socrates, from Emblemata Horatiana illustrated by Otho Vaenius, 1607. It seems that Xenophon's portrayal of her in his Symposium has been the most influential: Diogenes La√´rtius, for example, seems to quote the Symposium passage, though he does not mention Xenophon by name, and the term \\"Xanthippe\\" has now come to mean any nagging scolding person, especially a shrewish wife. Later writers, such as Diogenes La√´rtius who cite Aristotle as the earliest source, say that Socrates had a second wife called Myrto. Plutarch tells of a similar story, reporting that it comes from a work entitled On Good Birth, but he expresses doubt as to whether it was written by Aristotle.Plutarch, Aristides xxvii. 3‚Äì4 In Plutarch's version of the story, Socrates, who was already married, attended to Myrto's financial concerns when she became a widow; this does not entail marriage. We have no more reliable evidence on this issue.For the relevant quotes from Diogenes and Plutarch, see The Complete Works of Aristotle, edited by Jonathan Barnes, vol. 2, p. 2423. An unconfirmed anecdote purports that Xanthippe was once so enraged with her husband that she took a chamber pot and poured it out over Socrates' head, which ‚Äì according to the tale ‚Äì the philosopher accepted with the allegory: \\"After thunder comes the rain.\\" Literary references In William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, Petruchio compares Katherina \\"As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse\\" in Act 1 Scene 2. (Read here) Addison discusses matrimony in The Spectator no. 482, dated Friday 12 September 1712: The novelist Henry Fielding describes the shrewish Mrs. Partridge thus: The English Victorian poet Amy Levy wrote a dramatic monologue called \\"Xantippe\\". In his poem \\"An Acrostic\\", Edgar Allan Poe makes references to her although he (allegedly purposely) misspells her name and instead writes 'Zantippe'. Frank Osbaldistone, the first-person narrator of Rob Roy by Sir Walter Scott (1817), records this event: \\"While I trembled lest the thunders of their wrath might dissolve in showers like that of Xantippe, Mrs Flyter herself awoke, and began, in a tone of objurgation not unbecoming the philosophical spouse of Socrates, to scold one or two loiterers in her kitchen.\\" (Book 2, Chapter 7) In Doctor Thorne by Anthony Trollope, the author says of wives 'There may possibly have been a Xantippe here and there, but Imogenes are to be found under every bush.' Salomon Maimon refers to a woman's \\"Xanthippe-like character\\" in Chapter 10 of his autobiography. (\\"A widow, celebrated for her superior talents, as well as for her Xanthippe-like character, kept a public house at the extremity of one of the suburbs. She had a daughter who yielded to her in none of the above-mentioned qualities, and who was indispensable to her in the management of the house.

Wordsworth Classics edition. Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses, Don Gifford with Robert J Seidman, Revised and Expanded edition, University of California Press, 1988. In his essay \\"The Case for Xanthippe\\" (1960), Robert Graves suggested that the stereotype of Xanthippe as a misguided shrew is emblematic of an ancient struggle between masculinity (rationality, philosophy) and femininity (intuition, poetry), and that the rise of philosophy in Socrates' time has led to rationality and scientific pursuit coming to exercise an unreasonable dominance over human life and culture. In popular culture Xanthippe has a fairly important role in Maxwell Anderson's 1951 play Barefoot in Athens. In the 1966 Hallmark Hall of Fame television production, she was played by Geraldine Page opposite Peter Ustinov as Socrates. In the 1953 young-adult detective novel Detectives in Togas (1953) by Henry Winterfeld, the schoolboys often joke about their schoolmaster Xanthos, saying his name reminds them of Xanthippe. \\"Puttermesser and Xanthippe\\" is the title of one of the chapters of American novelist Cynthia Ozick's 1997 novel The Puttermesser Papers, a National Book Award finalist. In Cynthia Ozick's 1997 novel, The Puttermesser Papers, Ruth Puttermesser creates a golem who insists on being called Xanthippe. A fictional account of Xanthippe's relationship with her husband is presented in the play Xanthippe by the British author and playwright Deborah Freeman. Xanthippe was first produced at the Brockley Jack Theatre, London, in 1999. A rebellious, dramatic, female teen is named \\"Xanthippe\\" in the Netflix comedy Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt which first aired on Netflix in 2015. Emanuel Carnevali, Italian-American poet, in his Autobiography refers to women he meets while being treated for encephalitis in an Italian sanatorium as \\"Xanthippes all.\\" Xanthippe plays a minor role in the 2018 videogame Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, in which Socrates states that her argumentative nature is what attracted him to her, rather than her looks.

The stadium currently has an all-seated capacity of , which makes it the fifth-largest football stadium in Scotland. Easter Road is also known by Hibs fans as \\"The Holy Ground\\" or \\"The Leith San Siro\\". The venue has also been used to stage international matches, Scottish League Cup semi-finals and was briefly the home ground of the Edinburgh professional rugby union team. Hibs first played at the present site of Easter Road in 1893. The ground holds the record attendance for a Scottish match outside Glasgow, when 65,860 attended an Edinburgh derby on 2 January 1950. The size of the terracing was greatly reduced in the 1980s. After the publication of the Taylor Report, Hibs considered leaving Easter Road and moving to a different site (Straiton, near Loanhead was mooted), but these plans were abandoned in 1994. Redevelopment of the stadium began in 1995 and was completed in 2010. The Easter Road pitch had a pronounced slope until it was removed in 2000. History =Early history (1893‚Äì1945)= Hibernian played its first match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club first moved to the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This location had the advantage of being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde. Easter Road in the 1950s. Easter Road staged its first Scottish League match when Hibs joined the league in 1893. Hibs were only renting Easter Road, which Edinburgh city planners had designated for future development. This meant the club were unwilling to develop the ground and looked for alternatives. Hibs considered relocating to Aberdeen in 1902, a year before Aberdeen FC was formed by a merger of three local clubs. In 1909, work began on a potential new ground in the Piershill area of Edinburgh, but the North British Railway company won a court order allowing them to build a railway line over the ground. No line was ever built, but Hibs' interest in moving to the site was thwarted. The long-term future of Easter Road was only secured in 1922, when the club agreed a 25-year lease on the ground. Two years later, three banks of terraces were raised, while a main stand seating 4,480 people was built on the west side of the ground. The redeveloped stadium had a capacity of 45,000. The pitch was also moved 40 yards to the east, providing space for the main stand. The slope was reduced to approximately 6 feet as part of this work. =Post-war (1945-1991)= Hibs enjoyed great success in the period immediately after the end of the Second World War, winning three league championships between 1948 and 1952. The club's participation in the (inaugural) 1955‚Äì56 European Cup meant that Easter Road became the first British ground to host European Cup football. A record attendance of 65,860 was set by an Edinburgh derby against Hearts played on 2 January 1950. This is also a record for any football match played in Edinburgh. As the fans had been tightly packed on the terraces to achieve this record attendance, the size of the East Terrace was increased further. The club even drew up plans to expand the overall capacity to nearly 100,000. This would have been done by raising each end terrace to the same height as the east side, but these plans were never realised. Hibs were one of the first clubs to install corner floodlight pylons, rather than the roof-mounted lights used at Ibrox. The Easter Road floodlights were installed by a local company, Miller & Stables, who would construct similar leaning gantries in many other Scottish grounds. They were first used for an Edinburgh derby played on 18 October 1954. A roof was put over the North Terrace in the early 1960s, but the ground was largely unchanged through the 1960s and 1970s. The capacity was reduced in 1975 to 30,000, due to the regulations of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. Hibs became the first club in Scotland to install undersoil heating, in 1980. Benches were installed in the North Terrace in 1982, but this was only because they were cheaper than replacing the terrace crush barriers. Soon afterwards, Hibs chairman Kenny Waugh admitted that the stadium was a \\"mess\\". The East Stand, which was built in this form in 1985 and demolished in March 2010. The height of the East Terrace was greatly reduced and a roof was erected in the mid-1980s. This work reduced the capacity to 27,000. Hibs was taken over by a consortium led by David Duff in 1987. The new regime spent approximately ¬£1 million on executive boxes and refurbishments, but their policy of diversifying the business into property and public houses crippled the club financially when there was an economic downturn in the late 1980s. Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer attempted a takeover of Hibs in June 1990, with the intention of merging the two major Edinburgh football clubs. The Hibs fans protested against this and Mercer was prevented from gaining the 75% shareholding that was needed to close Hibs. =Redevelopment (1991-2010)= Sir Tom Farmer took control of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced with the need to develop a stadium that would meet the requirements of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500. The West Stand, constructed in 2001. Later in 1994, however, the Straiton proposals were abandoned and Easter Road underwent major redevelopment in 1995. Stands behind each goal were built at a cost of ¬£8 million, increasing the capacity to 16,531. The ground was made all seated by the installation of bucket seats in the East Terrace during 1995. Views of the pitch from this stand were somewhat restricted by supporting pillars. The Easter Road slope, which meant that the north end of the pitch was 6 feet lower than the south, was removed at the end of the 1999‚Äì00 season. The West Stand was built in 2001 to replace the ageing main stand, increasing capacity to 17,500. Despite this development work, a move to a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site would allow them to clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work. The club first obtained planning permission to replace the East Stand in 1999, and this was renewed in 2005. Hibs started a consultation with supporters on its redevelopment in 2007. The development was put on hold until sufficient cash resources were obtained to finance the project. The consultation process found that a single tier stand would be most popular with the fans. Petrie announced at the 2009 annual general meeting that the club would enter negotiations with contractors to establish the cost of rebuilding the stand. After these negotiations were concluded, Hibs announced in February 2010 that work would immediately begin on a new East Stand, increasing capacity to . Demolition of the old stand began in early March, and the stand was opened a month ahead of schedule in August 2010. Structure and facilities The new East Stand, opened in August 2010. Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, split into four geographic sections, known as the Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. The Famous Five and South Stands are the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep within the boundaries of the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the stands were built, the Famous Five Stand was above pitch level and the South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed. Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before the stands were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it. The West Stand, which initially had a capacity of 6,500, was built in 2001. A reception area, club offices, media centre, banqueting suites, hospitality area and changing rooms are located in the West Stand. The capacity of the West Stand was reduced slightly when the new East Stand was constructed in 2010, as the pitch was widened during this development. The East Stand, which is the newest part of the stadium, was built in 2010. It is the only stand that is not split into two tiers and has a capacity of 6,400. The decision to build the East Stand as a single tier was taken to maintain the character of the old terrace, which had been a simple viewing area without many facilities. Other uses =Other football matches= The exterior of Easter Road Kirkcaldy club Raith Rovers used Easter Road as a home venue once, for the home leg of a UEFA Cup tie against Bayern Munich in 1995. The match was moved from Rovers' normal home ground of Stark's Park due to Easter Road's greater capacity. Easter Road has sometimes played host to Scottish League Cup semi-final matches, such as in the 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013 and 2014 competitions. Team managers Terry Butcher and Gus MacPherson objected to playing semi-finals at Easter Road, on the grounds that their players should have the chance to play at Hampden Park, or that playing against Hearts in Edinburgh gives them a form of home advantage. The 2014 Scottish Challenge Cup Final between Raith Rovers and Rangers was hosted at Easter Road. Scotland have played seven full international matches at Easter Road. These have been friendly matches against less attractive opposition where a relatively small crowd was expected, and it has therefore been unnecessary to play the match at Hampden Park. The Scotland under-21 team has also sometimes played matches at Easter Road, such as when Scotland played Iceland in the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs. The most recent full international played at the stadium was a friendly match between Scotland and Canada in March 2017. One full international was played at Easter Road that did not involve Scotland, a friendly match between South Korea and Ghana that was played in advance of the 2006 World Cup. Scotland women played their first match at Easter Road in August 2019, a Euro 2021 qualifying match against Cyprus. Full internationals Eight men's full international football matches have been played at Easter Road, all of them since 1998. Easter Road hosted its first women's international match in August 2019. =Other sports= Easter Road was briefly the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a professional rugby union team, in the late 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998‚Äì99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest in using Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at Easter Road with a view to Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a longer term. It has since been announced that the team will move to Myreside from January 2017. One of the hospitality suites within the stadium staged an amateur boxing show on 15 November 2009. =Uses other than sport= Elton John performed Easter Road's first rock concert on 25 June 2005. The international headquarters of the Homeless World Cup is based in the South Stand of the stadium. Transport Edinburgh Waverley railway station, the main station in Edinburgh, is approximately from the stadium; the walk between the two sites takes approximately 20 minutes. There was a railway halt immediately beside the ground, part of the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway, which was opened in 1950 and closed in 1967. An extension to the Edinburgh Trams system, which will serve the stadium via the McDonald Road tram stop on Leith Walk, is under construction and is due to begin operations in spring 2023. Easter Road is served by several Lothian Buses routes. Services 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 22, 25 and 49 run down Leith Walk; services 1 and 300 run down Easter Road itself; services 4, 5, 15, 19, 26, 34 and 44 run along London Road and routes 34 and 49 serve Lochend Road. Several of these routes are affected by the tram construction works. East Coast Buses routes X5, X7, X24/124, 104 and 113 also serve the area. Visitors to the ground travelling by car can park in the surrounding streets. References ; Sources  External links * (Google Maps) Hibernian F.C.

It is the largest of the Japanese new religions and claims the largest membership among Nichiren Buddhist groups. ‚ÄúThe organization bases its teachings on Nichiren's interpretation of the Lotus Sutra and places chanting \\"Nam My≈çh≈ç Renge Ky≈ç\\" at the center of devotional practice. The organization promotes its goals as supporting \\"peace, culture, and education\\".http://www.sgiquarterly.org/artsedu2010Apr-1.html The movement was founded by educators Makiguchi and Toda on 18 November 1930, and held its inaugural meeting in 1937.Jacqueline I. Stone, Original Enlightenment and the Transformation of Medieval Japanese Buddhism (Studies in East Asian Buddhism), University of Hawaii Press 2003, , page 454. It was disbanded during the Second World War when much of the leadership was imprisoned for violations of the 1925 Peace Preservation Law and charges of l√®se-majest√©. After the war, it expanded to a claimed total of 750,000 households in 1958 through explosive recruitment, held to be unprecedented in Japanese media. Further expansion was led by its former third president Daisaku Ikeda. According to its own account, has 12 million members in 192 countries and territories around the world. Moving the group toward mainstream acceptance, the organization is still viewed with suspicion in Japan and has found itself embroiled in public controversies, especially in the first three decades following World War II.Phillip E. Hammond and David W. Machacek, \\"Soka Gakkai International\\" in J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann (eds.), Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 2658. \\"Daisaku Ikeda (b. 1928), Soka Gakkai's charismatic third president, led the international growth of the movement. Although Ikeda and his successor, Einosuke Akiya, have gone to great lengths to improve the movement's public image, suspicion remains. Soka Gakkai's political involvement through the organ of the Komeito, a political party founded by the Soka Gakkai, and the near godlike reverence that members have for President Ikeda have tended to perpetuate public distrust. Although it has been subjected to a generalized suspicion toward Eastern religious movements in the United States, Europe, and South America, the movement's history outside of Japan has been tranquil by comparison to its Japanese history.\\" \\"When I conducted a survey of 235 Doshisha University students a few years ago asking their opinions about the Gakkai and how much they knew about its peace education programs, over 80 percent responded that they had a negative image of the movement and about 60 percent thought that its 'peace movement' is little more than promotional propaganda. The few respondents with a positive image were either Soka Gakkai members, were related members, or were friends of members.\\" From 1952 to 1991, it was affiliated with the Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ Buddhist sect. Komeito, a political party closely aligned with Soka Gakkai and founded by elements of its lay membership, entered a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democratic Party in 1999 and is currently a junior partner in government. Beliefs The belief of the Soka Gakkai centers on recognizing that all life has dignity with infinite inherent potential; this immanent \\"Buddhahood\\" exists in every person and can be awakened through the Buddhist practice prescribed by Nichiren. Further, a person's social actions at every moment can lead to soka, or the creation of value (the theory of the interdependence of life). Societal change is facilitated through \\"human revolution\\", a way of living in the world that creates value. The doctrine of the Soka Gakkai derives from Nichiren, who promulgated the Lotus Sutra as he perceived its application to the epoch in which he and people today live. Soka Gakkai gives significance to Nichiren's writings, as Gosho,‚ÄúGo‚Äù is an honorific prefix and ‚Äúsho‚Äù means writings; thus, literally, honorable writings. and Soka Gakkai refers to the collection of Nichiren's writings that was compiled by Nichiko Hori and J≈çsei Toda, published as 'Nichiren Daishonin Gosho Zenshu' in 1952 (and later officially published an English translation, \\"The writing of Nichiren Daishonin\\", and in several other languages based on the collection). =The principle of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena= T‚Äôien-t‚Äôai (538‚Äì597), Chinese Buddhist scholar who upheld the Lotus Sutra, developed a theoretical system to describe the infinite interconnectedness of life translated as \\"the principle of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena\\" or \\"three thousand realms in a single moment of life\\" (Japanese: ichinen sanzen). This theory demonstrates that the entire phenomenal world exists in a single moment of life. Soka Gakkai members believe that because Nichiren made actualizing this possible by inscribing Gohonzon and teaching the invocation, their prayers and actions can in a single moment pierce through limitations. = \\"Life force\\" and \\"Human Revolution\\" = While imprisoned, Josei Toda studied a passage from the Immeasurable meanings sutra (considered the introduction to the Lotus Sutra) that describes Buddhahood by means of 34 negations ‚Äì for example, that it is \\"neither being nor non-being, this nor that, square nor round\\". From this, he concluded that \\"Buddha\\" is life, or life force. The \\"philosophy of life\\" restates principles formulated by Nichiren: \\"three thousand conditions in a single moment\\" (ichinen sanzen), and \\"observing one's own mind\\" (kanjin) The concept of life force is central to the Soka Gakkai's conception of the role of religion and the application of Nichiren's teachings. \\"Our health, courage, wisdom, joy, desire to improve, self-discipline, and so on, could all be said to depend on our life force\\", Ikeda says. Toda considered that the concept of \\"Buddha as life (force) means that Buddhism entails transforming society. Ikeda has been quoted as saying \\"Faith is firm belief in the universe and the life force. Only a person of firm faith can lead a good and vigorous life ... Buddhist doctrine is a philosophy that has human life as its ultimate object, and our Human Revolution movement is an act of reform aimed at opening up the inner universe, the creative life force within each individual, and leading to human freedom.\\" Soka Gakkai teaches that this \\"self-induced change in each individual\\"‚Äîwhich Josei Toda began referring to as \\"human revolution\\"‚Äîis what leads to happiness and peace. While older schools taught the attainment of Buddhahood in this life through the Gohonzon, they did not tie this to social engagement. Toda's conception of life force and human revolution means that one attain Buddhahood \\"through engagement in the realities of daily life, through attaining benefits and happiness that involve all of life, and through extending this happiness to others\\". = Oneness of mentor and disciple = The Soka Gakkai liturgy refers to all of its first three presidents‚ÄîTsunesabura Makiguchi, Josei Toda and Daisaku Ikeda‚Äîas \\"the eternal mentors of kosen-rufu\\", and \\"Soka Gakkai's long-time leader, Ikeda is revered by Gakkai members\\".Chilson, Clark (2014). \\"Cultivating Charisma: Ikeda Daisaku's Self Presentations and Transformational Leadership\\". Journal of Global Buddhism, Vol. 15., p. 67 The relationship between members and their mentors is referred to as \\"the oneness of mentor and disciple\\". The mentor is to lead and thereby improve the lives of his disciples. The mentor's actions is seen as giving disciples confidence in their own unrealized potential. The role of disciples is seen as supporting their mentor and realizing his vision using their unique abilities and circumstances. The relationship is seen as non-hierarchical and mutually weighted. Disciples are encouraged to be active creators rather than passive followers.Chilson, p. 69 Seager writes: \\"The oneness of the mentor-disciple relationship is described not in terms of demands and duties as many critics imagine it to be, but in terms of choice, freedom and responsibility. It is the disciple's choice and decision to follow the mentor's vision for their common goal. In response, it is the mentor's wish to raise and foster the disciple to become greater than the mentor. Since the mid-1990s, the issue of the oneness of mentor and disciple has received more prominence in the Soka Gakkai. There is a strong emphasis on \\"cultivating all members ... in discipleship\\" through forging \\"affective one-to-one relationships with Ikeda\\". =\\"On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land\\"= Nichiren wrote a treatise \\"On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land\\" in 1260 and submitted it to the regent. Soka Gakkai members believe that it is one of his most important writings. In it he claimed that the source of the natural disasters Japan faced at that time was due to the weakened spirit of its people, caused by attachments to religions that disavow the primacy of the people themselves. He called for the leaders and people to base their spiritual life on the Lotus Sutra, \\"the correct teaching\\", which would, in turn, lead to \\"the peace of the land\\". Ikeda has said, \\"Nichiren stressed the need to spread the correct teaching and firmly establish the philosophical principles of Buddhism in the heart of each individual.\\" Hence, \\"establishing the correct teaching\\" is the Soka Gakkai's religious mission, while \\"establishing the peace of the land\\" is its social mission. Reading this writing largely influenced Makiguchi to embrace Nichiren Buddhism; at his first meeting Ikeda decided to make Toda his mentor after hearing the latter lecture on this writing. Soka Gakkai members believe \\"the peace of the land\\" depends on transforming the heart and mind of one individual at a time, affirming the basic good within all people, respecting human dignity and the sanctity of life, and valuing dialogue. Furthermore, Soka Gakkai members believe these principles must become the spiritual foundation for peace in society and require joining forces with like-minded individuals and organizations. = Five \\"Eternal Guidelines of Faith\\" = In 1957, former Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda proclaimed three \\"Eternal Guidelines of Faith\\". In 2003, third President Daisaku Ikeda added two more guidelines. The Five Guidelines of Faith are: # Faith for a harmonious family; # Faith for each person to become happy; # Faith for surmounting obstacles; # Faith for health and long life; # Faith for absolute victory. =Relation to the Lotus Sutra= Soka Gakkai members pray to Nichiren's Gohonzon (see section on Gohonzon), which \\"embodies Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the essence of the Lotus Sutra\\". The Gohonzon includes the Sutra's teaching that all life inherently possesses dignity when \\"illuminated by the light of the Mystic Law\\". (The Real Aspect of the Gohonzon p 832), and depicts the ceremony in which bodhissatvs embrace \\"their mission to teach and preach to suffering people the path tp happiness and freedom\\". The Soka Gakkai's history is closely intertwined with the study of the Lotus Sutra. Josei Toda began the postwar reconstruction by lecturing on the sutra, the study of which led to what Soka Gakkai considers his enlightenment (see \\"Life Force and Human Revolution\\") After the Soka Gakkai's excommunication by Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´, Daisaku Ikeda conducted dialogue sessions on the Lotus Sutra which resulted in the publication of a six-volume work called The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra. The Soka Gakkai also sponsored the Burton Watson translation of the Lotus Sutra as well as several international exhibitions about the Lotus Sutra.http://www.sgiquarterly.org/news2008Jly-7.html Ikeda has referenced the Lotus Sutra in many of the annual peace proposals he submits to the United Nations. He compared the awakening of women mentored by Wangari Maathai to the essence of the Lotus Sutra, \\"a transformation from individuals seeking salvation to individuals taking action to help others free themselves from suffering.\\" = Karma (as \\"changing karma into mission\\") = The concept of karma is based on the law of causality. It refers to consequences created through one's actions, words or thoughts. Early Buddhism and as Professor Ved Nanda explains Hindus believe to redress karma accumulated over the course of many eons, one must be reincarnated numerous times. The concept of karma then often became a source of despair as well as a tool for Buddhist clergy to instill fear and guilt in the minds of believers. Soka Gakkai Nichiren Buddhism, however, believes that the fundamental cause for revealing the ultimate potential of life, or Buddha nature, can diminish the influence of negative karma in the present lifetime. Ikeda explains that negative karma is subsumed in the world of Buddhahood and is purified by its power. Importantly, Soka Gakkai members believe effects are determined simultaneously with causes, though they remain latent until the right external influences bring them to fruition. Soka Gakkai Buddhism teaches that even the most stubborn karma can be overcome as one reveals one's Buddha nature in this lifetime. Thus, karma becomes a source of hope and mission rather than despair. Practices The practice of Soka Gakkai members is directed to \\"oneself and others\\". =Chanting= The words Nam-myoho-renge-kyo (also called Daimoku) is the main practice of the organization, which is claimed to express the true nature of life through Cause and Effect. The believers of the organization chant these words reputed to change their lives, including the natural environments in which they live. Accordingly, the intended goal is to produce an internal change that serves as the motivator for external social change. Furthermore, the organization teaches that chanting cannot be divorced from action. Soka Gakkai members believe that chanting releases the power of the universal life force inherent in life. For some members, chanting for material benefits is a first step toward realizing the ultimate goal of Buddhahood. It further claims that there is no separation between life in the world and the universal life of Buddhahood, and leads to effects in daily life Thus, Buddhahood is expressed to be as the process of transforming, and as the actual transformation of, daily life. Therefore, chanting is not approached as a passive exercise, as Soka Gakkai literature urges practitioners to have \\"conviction\\", tenacity and perseverance and to challenge their personal problems. =Gohonzon= The Gohonzon Soka Gakkai members enshrine in their homes and centers is a transcription by the 26th High Priest Nichikan Shonin. The central main syllabary of characters reads Namu-Myoho-Renge-Kyo (Kanji: Âçó ÁÑ° Â¶ô Ê≥ï ËìÆ ËèØ Á∂ì). The lower portion reads \\"Nichi-Ren\\" (Kanji: Êó• ËìÆ). On the corners are the names of the Four Heavenly Kings from Buddhist cosmology, and the remaining characters are names of Buddhist deities reputed to represent the various conditions of life. The organization teaches that in contrast to worshiping the Buddha or Dharma as anthropomorphized personifications, Nichiren deliberately made a calligraphic mandala, rather than Buddhist statues as the central object of devotion. American author, Richard Seager explains the following: The Soka Gakkai often uses Nichiren's metaphor of a mirror to explain its faith in the Gohonzon. The Gohonzon \\"reflects life's innate enlightened nature and cause it to permeate every aspect of member's lives\\". Members chant to the Gohonzon \\"to reveal the power of their own enlightened wisdom and vow to put it to use for the good of themselves and others\\". The organization teaches that a member is considered to be practicing the Lotus Sutra when chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo to the Gohonzon. =Faith, practice, and study= The primary practice of the Soka Gakkai, like that of most Nichiren sects, is chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which is the title of the Lotus Sutra, and simultaneously considered the Buddha nature inherent in life. and the ultimate reality of existence. The supplemental practice is the daily recitation of parts of the 2nd and 16th chapters of the Lotus Sutra. Unlike other Nichiren sects, the Soka Gakkai stresses that practicing for this enlightenment entails actual \\"engagement in the realities of daily life\\", while including the happiness of others in one's own practice. Believers claim that the Lotus Sutra contains principles or teachings that are not readily apparent. Furthermore, the organization claims that Nichiren revealed these teachings as The ‚ÄùThree Great Secret Laws‚Äù namely the following:. # The ‚ÄúObject of Devotion‚Äù (Gohonzon mandala) used and designated by the Soka Gakkai organization # The incantation (of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) by united SGI believers # The sanctuary or place where Buddhism is practiced. In addition, the Soka Gakkai publishes study materials, including the writings of Nichiren and the Lotus Sutra, and has a well-developed program of study. Its series of study examinations reflects its roots as an educational reform society. As a New Religion, Soka Gakkai practices Nichiren Buddhism as it has been expounded by its three founding presidents, and so also studies their speeches and writings, especially those of 3rd President Daisaku Ikeda. His novelized histories of the movement, The Human Revolution (and its sequel The New Human Revolution) have been said to have \\"canonical status\\" as it \\"functions as a source of inspiration and guidance for members\\". Study meetings are held monthly. \\"The tenor of the meetings is one of open discussion rather than didactic teaching‚Ä¶\\" Discussions on Nichiren's teachings are welcomed, \\"dictatorial edicts on moral behavior are not.\\" The Soka Gakkai practice also includes activities beyond the ritualistic, such as meetings, social engagement, and improving one's circumstances; these also have significance as religious activities in the Soka Gakkai. The practices to improve oneself while helping others, and the study of Buddhism, combine with \\"faith\\" in what the Soka Gakkai considers \\"the three basic aspects of Nichiren Buddhism\\" - faith, practice and study. Faith, as explained in a booklet given by SGI-USA to prospective new members, is an expectation that deepens with experience as one practices in the Soka Gakkai. =Discussion meetings= Gakkai meetings have been called \\"formal liturgies\\" in that their format‚Äî\\"chanting, relatos (experiences), teachings, inspiring entertainment\\"‚Äîis identical from place to place. Discussion meetings are among the most important activities of the Soka Gakkai. Professor of philosophy at Virginia Tech University Jim Garrison writes that John Dewey‚Äôs belief ‚Äúthat the heart and guarantee of democracy is in free gatherings of neighbors and friends in the living rooms of houses and apartments to converse freely with one another.‚Äù Garrison points out that the Soka Gakkai grew out of precisely such gatherings. \\"Soka Gakkai discussion meetings are a wonderful example of grass-roots democracy.\\" At discussion meetings, participants are encouraged to take responsibility \\"for their own lives and for wider social and global concerns\\". The format is an example of how the Soka Gakkai is able to \\"dispense with much of the apparatus of conventional church organization\\". =Proselytizing= At one time, the Soka Gakkai's expansion methods were controversial, as it employed a Buddhist method called shakubuku, a term employed by Nichiren, translated as \\"break and subdue (attachments to inferior teachings).\\" The reason for propagation, as explained by Josei Toda, is \\"not to make the Soka Gakkai larger but for you to become happier ... There are many people in the world who are suffering from poverty and disease. The only way to make them really happy is to shakubuku them.\\" In 1970 Ikeda prescribed a more moderate approach, \\"urging its members to adopt an attitude of openness to others\\"; the method Soka Gakkai prefers since then is called shoju - \\"dialogue or conversation designed to persuade people rather than convert them\\", though this is often referred to still as \\"shakubuku spirit.\\" In 2014 the Soka Gakkai changed the \\"Religious Tenets\\" section of its Rules and Regulations as regards propagation. Formerly, the Tenets said the Soka Gakkai \\"would seek to realize its ultimate goal - the widespread propagation of Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism throughout Jambudvipa (the world), thus fulfilling the Daishonin's mandate.\\" The new version says \\"it shall strive, through each individual achieving their human revolution, to realize as its ultimate goal the worldwide propagation of Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism, thus fulfilling the Daishonin's mandate.\\" According to Soka Gakkai President Harada, \\"worldwide propagation\\" is a function of individuals undergoing positive change in their lives. The belief of the Soka Gakkai, then, is that propagation activities give meaning both to the activity itself and to the personal lives of its members.Seagarpage=96 History The following are categorized records of the first three presidents of the organization, their leadership and list of contributions. =Makiguchi years: 1930‚Äì44= Foundation Tsunesabur≈ç Makiguchi, first President of the S≈çka Gakkai In 1928, educators Tsunesabur≈ç Makiguchi and J≈çsei Toda both converted to Nichiren Buddhism. The Soka Gakkai officially traces its foundation to November 1930, when Makiguchi and Toda published the first volume of Makiguchi's magnum opus on educational reform, S≈çka Ky≈çikugaku Taikei (Ââµ‰æ°ÊïôËÇ≤Â≠¶‰ΩìÁ≥ª, The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy). The first general meeting of the organization, then under the name S≈çka Ky≈çiku Gakkai (, \\"Value Creating Educational Society\\"), took place in 1937.Levi McLaughlin, Handbook of Contemporary Japanese Religions, Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion, , page 282 The membership eventually came to change from teachers interested in educational reform to people from all walks of life, drawn by the religious elements of Makiguchi's beliefs in Nichiren Buddhism. The group had a focus on proselytization growing from an attendance of 60 people at its first meeting to about 300 at its next meeting in 1940.Kisala, pp. 141‚Äì142 Repression during the war Makiguchi, as did Nichiren, attributed the political troubles Japan was experiencing to supposedly false religious doctrines that held sway. His religious beliefs motivated him to take a stand against the government, earning him a reputation as a political dissident. He regarded Nichiren Buddhism as religious motivation for \\"active engagement to promote social good, even if it led to defiance of state authority\\".Watanabe, Takesato. \\"The Movement and the Japanese Media\\". In Machacek and Wilson, eds. Global Citizens, p. 221. OUP. . The organization soon attracted the attention of the authorities. In 1943, the group was instrumental in forcing Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ to refuse a government-sponsored mandate to merge with Nichiren Sh≈´, per the Religious Organizations Law which had been established in 1939. As the war progressed, the government had ordered that a talisman from the Shinto shrine should be placed in every home and temple. While the Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ priesthood had been prepared to accept the placing of a talisman inside its head temple, Makiguchi and the Gakkai leadership had openly refused. During his prison interrogation by the Special Higher Police, Makiguchi claimed that his group had destroyed at least 500 of these amulets, a seditious act in those days.Strand, p. 33 In 1942, a monthly magazine published by Makiguchi called Kachi S≈çz≈ç (, \\"Creating values\\") was shut down by the government, after only nine issues. Makiguchi, Toda, and 19 other leaders of the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai were arrested on July 6, 1943, on charges of breaking the Peace Preservation Law and l√®se-majest√©: for \\"denying the Emperor's divinity\\" and \\"slandering\\" the Ise Grand Shrine. The details of Makiguchi's indictment and subsequent interrogation were covered in July, August, and October (1943) classified monthly bulletins of the Special Higher Police. With its leadership decimated, the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai disbanded.Robert L. Ramseyer. \\"The Soka Gakkai\\". \\"The neighbor complained to the police, who arrested Jinno and a director of the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai named Arimura.\\" In Beardsley, Richard K., editor, Studies in Japanese culture I. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1965. p. 156 During interrogation, Makiguchi had insisted that \\"The emperor is an ordinary man ... the emperor makes mistakes like anyone else\\". The treatment in prison was harsh, and within a year, all but Makiguchi, Toda, and one more director had recanted and been released. On November 18, 1944, Makiguchi died of malnutrition in prison, at the age of 73. =Toda years: 1945‚Äì1958= J≈çsei Toda, second President of the S≈çka Gakkai J≈çsei Toda was released from prison on July 3, 1945, after serving two years of imprisonment on the charges of l√®se majest√©. His health had been severely compromised and businesses destroyed. He immediately set out to rebuild the organization that had been repressed and dismantled by the government during the war. From this start, Toda served as the link between the movement's founder, Makiguchi, and Ikeda, who led its international evangelism. The reconstruction of the organization While imprisoned, Toda studied a passage for the Immeasurable meanings sutra (considered the introduction to the Lotus Sutra) that describes Buddhahood by means of 34 negations ‚Äì for example, that it is \\"neither being nor non-being, this nor that, square nor round\\". From this, he concluded that \\"Buddha\\" is life, or life force. The \\"philosophy of life\\" restates principles formulated by Nichiren: \\"three thousand conditions in a single moment\\" (ichinen sanzen), and \\"observing one's own mind\\" (kanjin) The concept of life force is central to the Soka Gakkai's conception of the role of religion and the application of Nichiren's teachings. \\"Our health, courage, wisdom, joy, desire to improve, self-discipline, and so on, could all be said to depend on our life force,\\" Ikeda says. The groundwork for the organization's growth can be found in Toda's work during the years between his release from prison (1945) and his inauguration (1951). He officially re-established the organization, now under the shortened moniker S≈çka Gakkai (\\"Value-creation society\\"), integrated his prison awakenings into the doctrine of the Soka Gakkai, began locating members who had dispersed during the war, started a series of lectures on the Lotus Sutra and Nichiren's letters, undertook business ventures (largely unsuccessful) to provide a stream of revenue for the organization, provided personal encouragement to many members, launched a monthly study magazine , and the newspaper Seikyo Shimbun, launched propagation efforts, and involved the active participation of youth including Daisaku Ikeda who was to become his right-hand man and successor. Brannen, a Christian missionary writing in 1969, describes the Soka Gakkai's study program at this point as \\"the most amazing program of indoctrination Japan has ever seen\\". New members attended local study lectures, subscribed to weekly and monthly periodicals, studied Toda's commentaries on the Lotus Sutra, took annual study examinations, and were awarded titles for their achievements such as Associate Lecturer, Lecturer, Associate Teacher, or Teacher. =\\"The Great Propagation Drive\\"= During \\"The Great Propagation Drive\\" of 1951‚Äì58 the Soka Gakkai doubled and tripled in size each year, resulting in a claimed membership of 750,000 families. The drive began with the 1951 inauguration speech of Josei Toda when he assumed the presidency of the organization. Before 1,500 assembled members, Toda resolved to convert 750,000 families before his death. The goal was attained several months before Toda's death. The accuracy of this figure was never confirmed by outside sources. The primary vehicle of the propagation efforts were small group discussion meetings. The driving force behind the drive were the efforts of Daisaku Ikeda and the Soka Gakkai Youth Division. Montgomery, Daniel, Fire in the Lotus, (1991). Mandala, an imprint of Grafton Books. p. 186 and p. 189, quote=Toda stated in his speech, \\"If this goal is not realized while I am still alive, do not hold a funeral for me. Simply dump my remains in the bay at Shinagawa.\\"Nakano, Tsuyoshi. \\"Religion and State.\\" In Tamaru, Norioshi and David Reid, eds. 1996. Religion in Japanese Culture: Where Living Traditions Meet a Changing World. Tokyo: Kodansha, International. . P. 125. Segments of the Japanese population that had been marginalized or dislocated after the war were highly attracted to the movement.McLaughlin (2012):278‚Äì279. \\"S√µka Gakki was driven forward by adherents who came to the group from the fringes of modern Japanese society. They were attracted to the Gakkai in part because it addressed them in an educational idiom, promising access to legitimate and legitimizing practices associated with a pedagogical framework. This was crucial in Japan of the mid‚Äîtwentieth century, a society obsessed by standards imposed by educational systems, whose members were quick to judge one another based on perceived levels of cultural sophistication. The Value Creation Study Association appealed to the people postwar Japan as a forum for the socially disenfranchised to study, to learn, to prove themselves within meritocratic institutions modeled on the mainstream schools and other educational establishments in which they otherwise had few chances to participate. Soka Gakkai's academic idiom that appealed to so many in postwar Japan speaks not only to members' desire to realize legitimacy through educational pursuits; the group also appeals to members' aspirations to join Japan's social elite. ... Soka Gakkai is proof that the socially disenfranchised need not sit idle; they are aware of what they lack, and, when organized en masse and inspired by the possibilities of upward social mobility, they themselves create the institutions that grant social mobility‚Äî political parties, newspapers, study circles, schools, museums, organizations for the performing arts, and opportunities for musical training. They create alternative means of reaching for the social legitimacy that remains out of their reach in mainstream society, of securing recognition ordinarily granted by the central institutions of the modern nation; they create groups like Soka Gakkai.\\"Aruga, Hiroshi. \\"S≈çka Gakkai and Japanese Politics,\\" in Machacek, David and Bryan Wilson, eds, Global Citizens: The S≈çka Gakkai Buddhist Movement in the World, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 104‚Äì114 The success of the propagation efforts rocked traditional Japanese society; the press covered many extreme incidents of propagation but did not cover the many examples of conversion accomplished through \\"moral suasion.\\"Brannen (1968), pp. 100‚Äì101. There are several competing narratives that attempt to explain how the Soka Gakkai was able to achieve this rapid growth. One narrative portrays a drive powered by the \\"seemingly unlimited enthusiasm\\" of its members that was masterminded by Toda and channeled by his younger followers. The organization's own publications articulate this narrative. Ikeda explained his own efforts to introduce others to the Soka Gakkai. Ikeda gives accounts of how the momentum for propagation was created in Kamata (1952) and Bunkyo (1953). In his autobiographical novel The Human Revolution, Ikeda discusses in detail how the propagation efforts unfolded in the Osaka-Kansai region (1956). Common to all three accounts were efforts sparked by individual members who enjoyed their practice, long-standing efforts to build friendships, home visitation, small group meetings, and the \\"guidance\\" provided by Toda. The resulting enthusiasm of members had an explosive effect. Seager and Strand document support for this narrative. A second narrative examines the Soka Gakkai's expansion through a sociological lens. White, in the first English-language sociological work on the Soka Gakkai, attributes the growth, cohesion, and sustainability of the organization to the organizational skills of its leaders, its system of values and norms that match the individual needs of members, and its ability to adapt to changing times. According to Dator, the organizational structure of the Soka Gakkai, which values individual participation within small heterogeneous groups and parallel peer associations by age, gender, and interests, fulfills members' socio-psychological needs.https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/3150 A third narrative tracks criticisms of the Soka Gakkai in the popular press and by other Buddhist sects. This narrative implies that the propagation efforts succeeded through intimidating and coercive actions committed by Soka Gakkai members such as the practice then of destroying the household Shinto altars of new members. There were reports of isolated incidents of violence conducted by Soka Gakkai members but also incidents directed toward them. Fisker-Nielsen doubts whether claimed tactics such as coercion and intimidation could satisfactorily explain the ongoing success of Soka Gakkai's campaigns.Fisker-Nielsen, Anne Mette (2012). Religion and Politics in Contemporary Japan: Soka Gakkai Youth and Komeito. London: Routledge. (Japan Anthropology Workshop Series), p. 23 All scholars agree on the effectiveness of Toda and Ikeda's leadership throughout the Great Propagation Drive. Strand calls Toda \\"the most innovative, most dynamic, most successful religious leader of his day\\". More than charismatic or persuasive, he was effective due to his deep personal conviction that only the Soka Gakkai could renew a society in despair. He used both aggressive hyperbole and melodrama while at the same time cautioning overzealous followers to be sensible in their propagation efforts. Ikeda was the operational head of the propagation efforts, serving as a charter member of the executive staff of the Youth Division (1951) and later as Chief of Staff (1954). =Death and legacy= Toda died on April 2, 1958. The funeral was held at his home, but the coffin was afterwards carried past weeping, chanting crowds to the Ikebukuro temple Jozaiji, where he was buried. The then prime minister Nobusuke Kishi attended the funeral - something that scandalized \\"quite a few Japanese\\" but was a testament to how the Gakkai had grown to a force to be reckoned with under Toda. Murata claims that for two years after Toda's death, there was a leadership vacuum and the Gakkai had no president, as it was unclear if anyone was able to replace him. Other scholars disagree, claiming Ikeda became the de facto leader of the Soka Gakkai right away. Three months after Toda's death Ikeda, at age 30, was appointed the organization's General Administrator, in 1959 he became the head of its board of directors, and, on May 3, 1960, its third president.McLaughlin (2012), p. 292White (1970), p. 44 =Ikeda years: 1960‚Äì= Daisaku Ikeda, third President of the Soka Gakkai, 2010 Daisaku Ikeda receiving \\"Leonardo Prize\\" in 2009 from Alexander Yakovlev J≈çsei Toda was succeeded as president in 1960 by the 32-year-old Daisaku Ikeda. Ikeda would come to be a moderating and secularizing force. Ikeda formally committed the organisation to the principles of free speech and freedom of religion and urged, from 1964, a gentler approach to proselytizing. Under Ikeda's leadership, the organization expanded rapidly, both inside and outside Japan during the 1960s. Within the first 16 months of Ikeda's presendency the organization grew from 1,300,000 to 2,110,000 members. By 1967 it grew to 6,240,000 families according to its own reporting. In 1968 over 8,000,000 people contributed to the construction of the Sho-Hondo. Between 1961 and 1968 the organization's Study Department (members who sit for graded examinations on doctrinal matters) grew from 40,000 to 1,447,000. By 1968, under Ikeda's leadership, the daily Seikyo Shimbun newspaper attained a circulation of 3,580,000. Today, it has a circulation of 5.5 million copies, making it Japan's third largest daily. International growth In October 1960, five months after his inauguration, Ikeda and a small group of staff members visited the United States, Canada (Toronto), and Brazil. In the United States he visited Honolulu, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles, meeting with members, the vast majority Japanese war brides, at discussion and guidance meetings, setting up local organizations, and appointing leaders to take responsibility. He encouraged attendees to become good American citizens, learn English, and get driving licenses. Ikeda also expanded the scope and pattern of the Gakkai's activities. In 1961 Ikeda created an arm of the organization, the Culture Bureau, to accommodate nonreligious activities. It had departments for the study and discussion of Economics, Politics, Education, Speech, and, later in the year, the Arts. Ikeda and his team visited countries in Europe and Southeast Asia in 1961 and the Near and Middle East in 1962. By 1967 Ikeda had completed 13 trips abroad to strengthen the overseas organizations. Parallel to these efforts Ikeda attempted to find the universal aspects of Nichiren Buddhism stripped away from Japanese context. The Gakkai's first overseas mission, called \\"Nichiren Shoshu of America\\" (NSA), grew rapidly and claimed some 200,000 American adherents by 1970. Ikeda founded Soka Junior and Senior High Schools in 1968 and Soka University in 1971. \\"Soka Gakkai International\\" (SGI) was formally founded in 1975, on Guam. Founding of the Komeito In 1961 Soka Gakkai formed the \\"Komei Political League\\". Seven of its candidates were elected to the House of Councillors. In 1964 the Komeito (Clean Government Party) was formed by Ikeda. Over the course of several elections it became the third largest political party, typically amassing 10‚Äì15% of the popular vote. The New Komeito Party was founded in 1998 and has been allied with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 1999. Religious scholar and political analyst Masaru Sato explains that there is nothing surprising about Komeito becoming a member of a ruling coalition as the Soka Gakkai has become a world religion (as SGI) and history shows a link between ruling coalitions and world religions. He explains that in postwar Japan there were two major parties, the Liberal Democratic Party representing financial interests and large corporations and the Japan Socialist Party largely advocating the interests of labor unions. There was no single party that represented people who belonged to neither such as shop owners, housewives, etc. Until the appearance of the Komeito Party, such people were left on the sidelines. In 2014 the New Komeito was renamed Komeito again. Komeito generally supports the policy agenda of the LDP, including the reinterpretation of the pacifist Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, proposed in 2014 by LDP Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe to allow \\"collective defense\\" and to fight in foreign conflicts. 1969: Crisis and transformation In 1969, a prominent university professor named Fujiwara Hirotatsu authored the book I Denounce Soka Gakkai (Soka Gakkai o kiru) in which he severely criticized the Gakkai. The Gakkai and K≈çmeit≈ç attempted to use their political power to suppress its publication. When Fujiwara went public with the attempted suppression, the Soka Gakkai was harshly criticized in the Japanese media. In response, Ikeda made major shifts to the Gakkai's message. He committed the organization to the rights of free speech and freedom of religion. Admitting that the organization had been intolerant and overly sensitive in the past, Ikeda called for moderating conversion activities, openness to other religious practices, and a democratization of the organization. The Soka Gakkai's years of constant growth came to an end. On May 3, 1970, Ikeda gave a speech at the Soka Gakkai's 33rd general meeting which radically shifted the direction of the organization. He stated that Nichiren's message could be understood as absolute pacifism, the sanctity of human life, and respect for human dignity. In the 1970s Ikeda helped transition the Soka Gakkai from an internally focused organization centered on its own membership growth to one adopting a focus on a motto of \\"Peace, Culture, and Education\\". On October 12, 1972, at the official opening of the Shohondo at Taiseki-ji Ikeda announced the start of the Soka Gakkai's \\"Phase Two\\" which would shift direction from aggressive expansion to a movement for international peace through friendship and exchange. In the speech Ikeda also announced that K≈çmeit≈ç members who served in national and local assemblies would be removed from Soka Gakkai administrative posts.Nakano, Tsuyoshi. \\"Religion and State\\". In: Tamura, Noriyoshi and David Reed, eds. 1996. Religion in Japanese Culture: Where Living Traditions Meet a Changing World. Tokyo: Kodansha International, p. 127. Ikeda renounced any plans to create a \\"national ordination platform\\". Over the years the Soka Gakkai has matured under Ikeda's leadership and its values accord with progressive internationalism. \\"Citizen diplomacy\\" by Ikeda Ikeda initiated a series of dialogues with prominent political, cultural, and academic figures which he labeled \\"citizen diplomacy\\". In 1970 he held a dialogue with Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi centered on East-West issues and future directions the world could take. Ikeda conducted ten days of dialogue with Arnold J. Toynbee between 1972 and 1974 which resulted in the publication of the book \\"Choose Life\\". In 1974 he conducted a dialogue with Andr√© Malraux.Malraux, Andre and Ikeda, Daisaku. Ningen kakumei to ningen no joken (Changes Within: Human Revolution vs. Human Condition) Tokyo: Ushio Shuppansha Tokyo 1976 Today, the number of his dialogues with scholars, leaders, activists and others has reached 7,000. In 1974 Ikeda visited China, then the Soviet Union, and once again to China when he met with Zhou Enlai. In 1975 Ikeda met with then Secretary-General of the United Nations Kurt Waldheim and United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Ikeda presented Waldheim with a petition, organized by Soka Gakkai youth, calling for nuclear abolition and signed by 10,000,000 people. Former relations with the Nichiren Shoshu sect In 1990, the Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ administration excommunicated the Soka Gakkai with which it had been affiliated since 1952. In response, the Soka Gakkai countered by outlining Nichiren Shoshu's deviation from their own interpretation of Nichiren's doctrines, along with accusations of simony and hedonism among its ranking priests. The sect also condemned Ikeda for abandoning the aggressive propagation style (shakubuku) that led to some social criticism of the lay group, though not the priesthood. The priesthood further accused the organization of impiety and sacrilegious behavior, citing the song Ode to Joy along with the promotion of its musical performance, The Ninth Symphony as evidence for non-Buddhist teachings. In 2014, the Soka Gakkai rewrote its bylaws to reflect that it no longer had any relationship with Nichiren Shoshu or its doctrine. A \\"Soka Spirit website established in the 1990s that criticizes Nichiren Shoshu is still active.http://sokaspirit.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/12/4_journey_same_reason.pdf  Soka Humanism  The Soka Gakkai practices what has been called \\"Soka Humanism\\", which it attributes to Lotus Sutra teaching that the \\"Buddha is life itself\\". Accordingly, the organization also claims that the goal of human activity and religion is the welfare of human beings. Daisaku Ikeda writes: In May 1970, Daisaku Ikeda clarified the Soka Gakkai's role, transcending proselytizing, was to create a foundation of humanism in all aspects of society. In addition, the cultural endeavors of the Soka Gakkai are viewed by its adherents as expressions of Buddhist humanism and are aligned to creating a peaceful and more humane society. \\"Peace, culture, and education\\" In the 1970s, the Soka Gakkai began to re-conceptualize itself as an organization promoting the theme of \\"Peace, culture, and education.\\" In later years, the three themes were institutionalized within the 1995 charter of the Soka Gakkai International. =Peace activities= The group's peace activities can be traced back to the Toda era ‚Äì at an athletic meeting in 1957, Toda called for a complete ban on nuclear weapons. A 1975 petition drive against nuclear weapons by the Gakkai's youth division garnered 10 million signatures, and was handed over to the United Nations.Richard H. Seager, Encountering the Dharma: Daisaku Ikeda, Soka Gakkai, and the Globalization of Buddhist Humanism, University of California Press:2006, p. 83 Culture of peace The Soka Gakkai was included in a collective Buddhist response to UNESCO's \\"Declaration on the Role of Religion in the Promotion of a Culture of Peace\\", established in Barcelona in December 1994. The Soka Gakkai's contribution to building a culture of peace is summarized by person-to-person diplomacy, the promotion of small community discussion meetings with egalitarian mores reflecting the Lotus tradition, the promotion of the values of compassion, wisdom, and courage to promote action to nurture world citizenship, and participation in cultural events to foster the culture of peace.David W. Chappell, \\"Introduction\\", in David W. Chappell (ed.), Buddhist Peacework: Creating Cultures of Peace, Wisdom Publications: 1999, pp. 22‚Äì23 Peace and human rights activists such as Dr. Lawrence Carter of Morehouse College and Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, who partnered with the Soka Gakkai in various exhibits and presentations, praise the organization's efforts. Support of United Nations SGI has been in consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 1983. As an NGO working with the United Nations, SGI has been active in public education with a focus mainly on peace and nuclear weapons disarmament, human rights and sustainable development. Each year, Ikeda publishes a peace proposal which examines global challenges in the light of Buddhist teachings. The proposals are specific and wide-ranging, covering topics as constructing a culture of peace, promoting the development of the United Nations, nuclear disarmament, the prohibition of child soldiers, the empowerment of women, the promotion of educational initiatives in schools such as human rights and sustainable development education, and calls to reawaken the human spirit and individual empowerment.Anwarul K. Chowdhury, \\"Introduction,\\" Olivier Urbain (ed), A Forum for Peace: Daisaku Ikeda's Proposals to the UN. IB Tauris, 2013, , pp. xi-xiv The complete texts of recent proposals are available at the SGI website. The Toda Institute for Global Peace and Policy Research has published a compilation of topical excerptss.Olivier Urbain (ed), A Forum for Peace: Daisaku Ikeda's Proposals to the UN. IB Tauris, 2013, Exhibitions The Soka Gakkai uses its financial resources for a number of civic activities. As a non-governmental organization of the United Nations, it has participated in many activities and exhibitions in conjunction with the UN. The Soka Gakkai has been active in public education with a focus mainly on peace and nuclear weapons disarmament, human rights and sustainable development. It has sponsored exhibits such as \\"A Culture of Peace For Children\\", which was featured in the lobby of the UN Building in New York and \\"Nuclear Arms: Threat to Our World\\". Soka Gakkai also contributed to The Earth Charter Initiative with the \\"Seeds of Change\\" exhibit, \\"a 'map' showing the way towards a sustainable lifestyle\\". SGI promotes environmental initiatives through educational activities such as exhibitions, lectures and conferences, and more direct activities such as tree planting projects and those of its Amazon Ecological Conservation Center run by SGI in Brazil. One scholar cites Daisaku Ikeda, SGI's president, to describe such initiatives as a Buddhist-based impetus for direct public engagement in parallel with legal efforts to address environmental concerns. In India, Bharat Soka Gakkai (SGI in India) debuted the traveling exhibit \\"Seeds of Hope\\", a joint initiative of SGI and Earth Charter International. At the exhibit opening in Panaji, the Indian state capital of Goa, regional planning head Edgar Ribeiro spoke of lagging efforts to implement environmental laws and that: \\"Only a people's movement can take sustainability forward.\\" In Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman University College President Datuk Dr Tan Chik Heok said that this exhibition helped \\"to create the awareness of the power of a single individual in bringing about waves of positive change to the environment, as well as the society.\\" Establishment of institutions The Soka Gakkai has established multiple institutions and research facilities to promote its values of peace. The Institute of Oriental Philosophy (founded in 1962), among other goals, clarifies the essence of Buddhism to peace studies. The Amazon Ecological Research Center (founded by Ikeda in 1992) outside Manaus, Brazil has pioneered reforestation, the creation of a regional seed bank and experiments in agroforestry. The Ikeda Center for Peace, Learning, and Dialogue (founded in 1993 as the Boston Research Center for the 21st Century), promotes dialogue between scholars and activists to prevent war and promote respect for life.Karel Dobbelaere, \\"Toward a Pillar Organization?\\" in Global Citizens, Machacek and Wilson (eds.), pp. 243, 250 The Toda Peace Institute (formerly called the Toda Institute for Global Peace and Policy Research) (founded in 1996) conducts peace-oriented international policy research through international conferences and frequent publications.Seager, p. 107 Responses to the organization Soka Gakkai's pacifist stand has been questioned, along with the group's support of Komeito, without denying that the group is very active in \\"trying to establish the basis for world peace\\". In Japan, there is a widespread negative perception of SGI's pacifist movement, which is considered to be mere public relations for the group. Nobel Peace and Chemistry Prize winner Linus Pauling has praised Daisaku Ikeda specifically for his work to foster a lasting worldwide peace. Dr. Lawrence Carter, the chaplain at the Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel at Morehouse College, considers the Soka Gakkai an important ally in getting the message of civil rights and non- violence to cultures beyond those that are Christian. He has said that Ikeda and the Soka Gakkai, with activities such as Victory Over Violence, have helped in his work to \\"revive the King legacy\\". The Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish rights organization, has also worked with the Soka Gakkai. Rabbi Abraham Cooper headed its efforts in the Pacific Rim, and in co- operation with the Soka Gakkai opened a Japanese version of the Center's Holocaust exhibit. Cooper said the organization's involvement actually improved the exhibit, and that through the Soka Gakkai, the Wiesenthal Center has found more partners in Japan. =Cultural activities= Gymnastic formation by the Brazil SGI team at Rio de Janeiro, on October 30, 2011. Performance art is one of Soka Gakkai's peace activities. The Soka Gakkai sponsors many cultural activities for its membership as well as the general public. Cultural institutions The Soka Gakkai's subsidiary organizations also have a social presence. The Min-On Concert Association is a subsidiary of the Soka Gakkai which Ikeda established in 1963. It claims to sponsor over 1100 concerts each year. It has sponsored tours by international artists such as the La Scala Opera Company, about which Ikeda told Min-On's director that he \\"wanted average Japanese people to see first class art, even if we lost a lot of money\\". Ikeda also founded the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum in 1983. It houses collections of western and oriental art, and has participated in exchanges with museums around the world.Karel Dobbelaere, \\"Toward a Pillar Organization?\\" in Global Citizens, Machacek and Wilson (eds.), page=245 Performance art Soka Gakkai considers dance and other genres of performance art to be a major aspect of its peace activities. It has a long tradition of \\"culture festivals,\\" originating in the 1950s, which take the form of group gymnastics (through its world-famous gymnastic formations), marching bands, traditional ensembles, orchestras, ballet, or choral presentations. The Soka Gakkai perceives these activities as vehicles for its members to experience the skills of cooperating with others, opportunities to engage in the personal discipline that performing arts provide, and occasions to overcome obstacles and to undertake one's own \\"human revolution.\\" They enhance peer networks and understanding of and commitment to the goals of the organization. In addition, they are viewed as expressions of Buddhist humanism and are aligned to the Soka Gakkai's ideals about creating a peaceful and more humane society. The tradition, which began in Japan, has been copied in other Soka Gakkai organizations in the world.Cultural performances and the youth of Soka Singapore, 26ff The organization's musical and dance wings are organized into ensembles or groups in the local and national levels and are categorized as: * Women's Corps of Drums/Marching bands (Kotekitai Corps of the SG) * Marching Bands/Concert Bands (Taiyo Ongakutai Bands of the SG) * Drum and Bugle Corps * Symphony Orchestras * Pop bands * Traditional groups * Male/female/mixed choirs * Youth Dance groups * Adult dance groups/ballet ensembles * Gymnastic formation groups (all-male/mixed) =Educational activities= The educational activities of the Soka Gakkai are often subsumed under the title of Soka education. Several educational institutions were either founded by the Soka Gakkai or were inspired by the educational writings of the Soka Gakkai's three presidents. Organization Hall of the Great Vow for Kosen-rufu (Kosen-rufu Daiseido) Soka Gakkai's Tokyo headquarters Formally, the Soka Gakkai International is the umbrella organization for all national organizations, while Soka Gakkai by itself refers to the Japanese arm. Soka Gakkai maintains an international political presence as a registered non-governmental organization with the United Nations. The basic functional organizational unit is the Block ‚Äì a group of members in a neighborhood who meet regularly for discussion, study and encouragement. A number of Blocks form a District, and Districts are grouped into Chapters. From there the Soka Gakkai is organized into Areas, Regions, Prefectures and, finally, Territories ‚Äì all under the umbrella of the national organization. Discussion and study meetings, the basic organizational activities, are conducted mainly at the Block level, though there are occasional meetings held at every level. =Membership= Soka Gakkai has, together with its international offshoot Soka Gakkai International (SGI), been described as \\"the world's largest Buddhist lay group and America's most diverse\\". Soka Gakkai International claims a total of over 12 million adherents. The majority of these belong to the Japanese organization, whose official membership count is 8.27 million households. According to statistics from the Agency for Cultural Affairs (a body of the Japanese Ministry of Education), the Japanese organization had 5.42 million individual members in 2000. A study in Europe found that most of new members joined because of the personalities of the people they met within the organization; but the biggest reason for continuing is the positive changes they see in their own lives. =List of Soka Gakkai presidents= The following are the list of the presidents of the Soka Gakkai: #Tsunesabur≈ç Makiguchi ‚Äì (18 November 1930 ‚Äì 2 May 1944) #J≈çsei Toda ‚Äì (3 May 1951 ‚Äì 2 May 1960) #Daisaku Ikeda ‚Äì (3 May 1960 ‚Äì 24 April 1979) \\\\+ (Honorary President of the Soka Gakkai International: 1979 ‚Äì Incumbent) # Hiroshi H≈çj≈ç ‚Äì (24 April 1979 ‚Äì 18 July 1981) # Einosuke Akiya ‚Äì (18 July 1981 ‚Äì 9 November 2006) #Minoru Harada ‚Äì (9 November 2006 ‚Äì incumbent) Economic and social influence The Soka Gakkai's newspaper, the Seikyo Shimbun, has a readership base of 5.5 million. Forbes magazine estimated that the organization has an income of at least $1.5 billion per year. Religion scholar Hiroshi Shimada has estimated the wealth of the Soka Gakkai at ¬•500 billion. SGI's president, Daisaku Ikeda, has been described by journalist Teresa Watanabe as one of the most powerful and enigmatic individuals in Japan. A 1995 San Francisco SFGate article describes Ikeda as a \\"charismatic leader\\" who can display a violent temper in private. According to religious scholar Jane Hurst, there is no indication he has exploited his position and his home has been described as \\"modest\\". =Japanese politics= =Humanitarian work= The Soka Gakkai conducts humanitarian aid projects in disaster stricken regions. As an organization it is not only dedicated to personal spiritual development but also to engaged community service. After the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Soka Gakkai facilities became shelters for the displaced and storage centers for food and supplies for the victims. The relief effort also included community support by youth groups, global fundraising for the victims, and spiritual support. SGI-Chile members collected supplies to deliver to a relief center after the country's 2014 earthquake. =Public perception= Today, Soka Gakkai is rarely criticized in mainstream news media. Ikeda occasionally contributes editorials to major newspapers, which also print reports on Gakkai business. Since the Komeito Party joined the ruling government coalition in 1999, widespread criticism by the media of the Soka Gakkai has abated and the Soka Gakkai is gaining acceptance as part of the Japanese mainstream.Mette Fisker-Nielsen, pp. 65‚Äì66.name=\\"Oxford University Press\\"> There has been a \\"fractured view\\" of the Soka Gakkai in Japan. On the one hand it is seen as a politically and socially engaged movement;Takesato Watanabe, \\"The Movement and the Japanese Media\\" in David Machacek and Bryan Wilson (eds.), Global Citizens, Oxford University Press, 2000. \\"The Soka Gakkai is exceptional in that no other large Japanese religious organization engages in both social and political issues‚Äîfrom the promotion of human rights to the protection of the environment and abolition of nuclear weapons‚Äîas actively as it does.\\" (p. 217) on the other, it is still viewed with suspicion by some Japanese. \\"When I conducted a survey of 235 Doshisha University students a few years ago asking their opinions about the Gakkai and how much they knew about its peace education programs, over 80 percent responded that they had a negative image of the movement and about 60 percent thought that its \\"peace movement\\" is little more than promotional propaganda. The few respondents with a positive image were either Soka Gakkai members, were related members, or were friends of members.\\"Phillip E. Hammond and David W. Machacek, \\"Soka Gakkai International\\" in J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann (eds.), Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 2658. \\"Daisaku Ikeda (b. 1928), Soka Gakkai's charismatic third president, led the international growth of the movement. Although Ikeda and his successor, Einosuke Akiya, have gone to great lengths to improve the movement's public image, suspicion remains. Soka Gakkai's political involvement through the organ of the Komeito, a political party founded by the Soka Gakkai, and the near godlike reverence that members have for President Ikeda have tended to perpetuate public distrust. Although it has been subjected to a generalized suspicion toward Eastern religious movements in the United States, Europe, and South America, the movement's history outside of Japan has been tranquil by comparison to its Japanese history.\\" James R. Lewis claims the Soka Gakkai's perception has suffered from sensationalist and often irresponsible treatment by the media even though the group has matured into a responsible member of society. \\"\\"For over half a century, one of the most controversial new religions in Japan has been Soka Gakkai. Although this group has matured into a responsible member of society, its ongoing connection with reformist political activity served to keep it in the public eye. Until relatively recently, it also had a high profile as the result of sensationalist and often irresponsible media coverage. Apparently as a direct consequence of the social consensus against this religion, some scholars have felt free to pen harsh critiques of Soka Gakkai--critiques in which the goal of promoting understanding has been eclipsed by efforts to delegitimate Soka Gakkai by portraying it as deluded, wrong, and/or socially dangerous. ... Soka Gakkai also spread to the United States and Europe, where it aroused controversy as a result of its intense proselytizing activities. Although it was never as controversial as groups like the Hare Krishna Movement or the Unification Church, Soka Gakkai‚Äîwhich in the United States went under the name Nichiren Shoshu of America after Soka Gakkai broke with Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´‚Äîwas not infrequently stereotyped as a brainwashing cult, particularly by anti-cult authors.\\" Other scholars reject the cult label.Macioti, p. 124. \\"It should be clear to all by now that Soka Gakkai is not a \\"sect.\\" It is not a small, two-faced cult, characterized by obscure and hidden agendas. Rather it is a movement that has given life to varied associations, all of which are engaged in promoting culture, and raising interest around the theme of values‚Äîand a movement that demands to be examined more closely by using scientific methodologies and instruments of evaluation.\\" Some scholars who utilize the Bryan R. Wilson typology of newly emerging denominations categorize it as \\"gnostic-manipulationist\\", a category of teachings holding that the world can improve as people master the right means and techniques to overcome their problems.Bryan Wilson, Religion in Secular Society. Penguin, 1969Bryan Wilson, Magic and the Millennium, Heinemann, London, 1973, pp. 18‚Äì30 According to Anne Mette Fisker-Nielsen, \\"Soka Gakkai's relentless, but highly successful, proselytizing in the 1950s stirred up fear in wider society. Soka Gakkai was portrayed by the mass media as aggressive even violent ‚Äì although it is difficult to find evidence.\\"Mette Fisker- Nielsen, Anne (2012) \\"Religion and Politics in Contemporary Japan: Soka Gakkai Youth and Komeito\\", Routledge, p. 52. Throughout the 1950s, the Soka Gakkai was a relatively radical movement that remained outside mainstream Japanese society, but since the foundation of the Komeito in the 1960s, it has considerably moderated its activities and has become a very mainstream movement, especially after the Komeito joined the coalition government in 1999. Soka Gakkai has long been a subject of criticism in the Japanese weekly tabloid news/magazine press. Press criticism of the Soka Gakkai should be seen against the backdrop of negative press coverage of new religious movements in general.Mette Fisker-Nielsen, Anne (2012) \\"Religion and Politics in Contemporary Japan: Soka Gakkai Youth and Komeito\\", Routledge, pp. 7‚Äì9 It is important to understand that Japanese journalism is unlike that of the West. Scholars point out that less than two percent of journalists in Japan have degrees in journalism. That plus feeble libel laws leave little recourse for the victims of malicious defamation. Associate Professor of Religion at Hamilton College, Richard Seager writes that it is time to cease being overly intrigued by the Soka Gakkai‚Äôs history of controversy. ‚ÄúOver the course of a relatively short period, the Soka Gakkai moved from the margins of Japanese society into its mainstream.‚Äù Cult appellation During the early postwar decades, the Soka Gakkai found itself embroiled in various controversies and appellations of \\"cult\\" and \\"cult of personality\\" have become attached to it. Claims of personality adulation towards Daisaku Ikeda is among the centerpoint of criticism from outsiders and former practitioners of the organization. Some criticism are also sourced from its former affiliate, Nichiren Shoshu who shared the same negative sentiment in 28 November 1991 citing claims of heresy. Nevertheless, in accordance to the organization's views, these charges have largely resulted from both negative and distorted media coverage. Newer scholarship has generally refuted the Soka Gakkai's former cult appellation, noting the organization's maturation, progressive qualities, and its calls to its membership to be excellent citizens.Macioti, p. 124. \\"It should be clear to all by now that Soka Gakkai is not a ‚Äòsect.‚Äô It is not a small, two-faced cult, characterized by obscure and hidden agendas. Rather it is a movement that has given life to varied associations, all of which are engaged in promoting culture, and raising interest around the theme of values‚Äîand a movement that demands to be examined more closely by using scientific methodologies and instruments of evaluation.\\" Criticism of the organization continues to exist, to which the organization describes its vision and structure as a continuing work of humanistic progress and continuous improvement. International perception The Republic of Uruguay honored the 25th anniversary of the SGI's founding with a commemorative postage stamp. The stamp was issued on October 2, the anniversary of SGI President Ikeda's first overseas journey in 1960. In 2005, National Youth Council of Singapore award the youth of Soka Gakkai in Singapore for their \\"community and youth services\\" work. The Soka Gakkai of the Republic of Cuba (SGRC) attained juridical recognition in 2007, following an official visit of Daisaku Ikeda in 1996. It has a membership of approximately 500 individuals spread throughout most of the country's provinces. In 2008, Ikeda was a recipient of the Order of Friendship, a state- issued award of the Russian Federation bestowed on foreign nationals whose work, deeds and efforts were aimed at the betterment of relations with the Russian Federation and its people. In 2012, President Ma Ying-jeou of The Republic of China (Taiwan) commended the Taiwan Soka Association for many years of effort in the areas of public welfare, education, and religious teaching. He pointed out that it had received from the Taiwanese government numerous awards such as \\"National Outstanding Social Organization Award\\", the \\"Award for Contribution to Social Education\\", and \\"Outstanding Religious Organization Award\\". In 2015, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi signed an agreement that recognizes the Soka Gakkai as a \\"Concordat\\" (It: \\"Intesa\\") that grants the religions status in \\"a special 'club' of denominations consulted by the government in certain occasions, allowed to appoint chaplains in the army - a concordat is not needed for appointing chaplains in hospitals and jails - and, perhaps more importantly, to be partially financed by taxpayers' money.\\" Eleven other religious denominations share this status. In the same year, the Soka Gakkai constituent organization in the United States (SGI-USA) spearheaded the first \\"Buddhist Leaders' Summit\\" at the White House which was attended by 125 leaders and teachers from 63 different Buddhist communities and organizations. In India the Soka Gakkai is associated with a renewed interest in Buddhism among urban, upper middle class, English-speaking youth. Among the European new religious movements, the European Soka Gakkai organization is one of the most active participants in dialogues with the European Commission's Bureau of European Policy Advisors. While they are not all formally affiliated with the Soka Gakkai, there are a number of overseas institutions that perceived to be associated with the Soka Gakkai, or with Ikeda. These include the Ikeda Peace Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Toda Institute of Oriental Philosophy in Hawaii; and educational institutions in the United States, Brazil, Singapore, Malaysia and China.

He has worked as a film critic for The Washington Times, a reporter and later op-ed editor for The Wall Street Journal,Columnist Biography: David Brooks, The New York Times a senior editor at The Weekly Standard from its inception, a contributing editor at Newsweek, and The Atlantic Monthly, and a commentator on NPR and the PBS NewsHour. Early life and education Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario, where his father was working on a PhD at the University of Toronto. He spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Brooks was raised Jewish but rarely attends synagogue.{{cite newsfirst=Davidlast=Brooksurl=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/opinion/17brooks.html?_r=1title=A Loud and Promised Landnewspaper=The New York Timesdate=April 16, 2009quote=As an American Jew, I was taught to go all gooey-eyed at the thought of Israel...\\" As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in the East Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history. His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey. As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: \\"In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.\\"University of Chicago Maroon, April 5, 1983. To his piece, Brooks appended the note: \\"Some would say I'm envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?\\" When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job. Early career Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times. He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him. In 1984, mindful of the offer he had received from Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern at Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent lifestyle that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions, Bach concerts, dinners at Buckley's Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut, and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities. > Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National > Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus > later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named > Brooks his successor if it hadn't been for his being Jewish. \\"If true, it > would be upsetting,\\" Brooks says. After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and wrote movie reviews for The Washington Times. Career Brooks and PBS staff at rehearsal for PBS Newshour in 2012. In 1986, Brooks was hired by The Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990 to 1994, the newspaper posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to Brussels, where he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard when it was launched in 1994. Two years later, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing. In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or \\"new upper class\\" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s. According to a 2010 article in New York Magazine written by Christopher Beam, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch. > Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William > Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. \\"I was looking for the > kind of conservative writer that wouldn't make our readers shriek and throw > the paper out the window,\\" says Collins. \\"He was perfect.\\" Brooks started > writing in September 2003. \\"The first six months were miserable,\\" Brooks > says. \\"I'd never been hated on a mass scale before.\\" In 2004, Brooks' book On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise, but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date October 2, 2012), and authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement. The book was excerpted in The New Yorker in January 2011 and received mixed reviews upon its full publication in March of that year. The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011. Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at Duke University's Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006. In 2013, he taught a course at Yale University on philosophical humility. In 2012, Brooks was elected to the University of Chicago Board of Trustees. He also serves on the Board of Advisors for the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. Political views Brooks on PBS Newshour discussing the US presidential election in 2016. Ideologically, Brooks has been described as a moderate, a centrist, a conservative, and a moderate conservative. Brooks has described himself as a \\"moderate\\", and said in a 2017 interview that \\"[one] of [his] callings is to represent a certain moderate Republican Whig political philosophy.\\" Ottawa Citizen conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as a \\"sophisticated pundit\\"; one of \\"those Republicans who want to 'engage with' the liberal agenda\\". When asked what he thinks of charges that he's \\"not a real conservative\\" or \\"squishy\\", Brooks has said that \\"if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don't fit that agenda. But I do think that I'm part of a long-standing conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke ... and Alexander Hamilton.\\" In fact, Brooks read Burke's work while he was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and \\"completely despised it\\", but \\"gradually over the next five to seven years ... came to agree with him\\". Brooks claims that \\"my visceral hatred was because he touched something I didn't like or know about myself.\\" In September 2012, Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying, \\"If it's from a loon, I don't mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it's Michelle Malkin attacking, I don't mind it.\\" With respect to whether he was \\"the liberals' favorite conservative\\" Brooks said he \\"didn't care\\", stating: \\"I don't mind liberals praising me, but when it's the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it's like uhhh, I gotta rethink this.\\" Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, \\"coming to my senses.\\" He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, when he was selected to present the socialist point of view during a televised debate with Nobel laureate free- market economist Milton Friedman. As Brooks describes it, \\"[It] was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. ... That didn't immediately turn me into a conservative, but...\\" Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators. In 2005, Brooks wrote what columnist Jonathan Chait described as \\"a witheringly condescending\\" column portraying Senator Harry Reid as an \\"unhinged conspiracy theorist because he accused the [George W. Bush] administration of falsifying its Iraq intelligence.\\" By 2008, five years into the war, Brooks maintained that the decision to go to war was correct, but that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had botched U.S. war efforts. In 2015, Brooks wrote that \\"[f]rom the current vantage point, the decision to go to war was a clear misjudgment\\" made in 2003 by President George W. Bush and the majority of Americans who supported the war, including Brooks himself. Brooks wrote \\"many of us thought that, by taking down Saddam Hussein, we could end another evil empire, and gradually open up human development in Iraq and the Arab world. Has that happened? In 2004, I would have said yes. In 2006, I would have said no. In 2015, I say yes and no, but mostly no.\\" Citing the Robb-Silberman report, Brooks rejected as a \\"fable\\" the idea that \\"intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was all cooked by political pressure, that there was a big political conspiracy to lie us into war.\\" Instead, Brooks viewed the war as a product of faulty intelligence, writing that \\"[t]he Iraq war error reminds us of the need for epistemological modesty.\\" His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being \\"a farce\\" and having \\"no significance\\" was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan. On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times titled \\"Party No. 3\\". The column imagined a moderate McCain-Lieberman Party in opposition to both major parties, which he perceived as polarized and beholden to special interests. Brooks was long a supporter of John McCain; however, he disliked McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a \\"cancer\\" on the Republican Party. He has referred to her as a \\"joke\\", unlikely ever to win the Republican nomination.David Brooks: Sarah Palin Is A 'Joke', TPMTv on YouTube, November 15, 2009 But he later admitted during a C-SPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous \\"cancer\\" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values. In a March 2007 article published in The New York Times titled \\"No U-Turns\\", Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. Alex Pareene commented that Brooks \\"has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can't still think it's going to happen soon.\\" Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: \\"Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don't know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. ... I remember distinctly an image of ‚Äì we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I'm thinking, a) he's going to be president and b) he'll be a very good president.\\" Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks \\"like a writer\\", explaining, \\"He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people.\\" Two days after Obama's second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled \\"Run, Barack, Run\\", urging the Chicago politician to run for president. However, in December 2011, during a C-SPAN interview, Brooks expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a \\"B-\\", and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50‚Äì50 if elections were held at that time. He stated, \\"I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have.\\" However, in a February 2016 New York Times op-ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's \\"integrity\\" and \\"humanity\\", among other characteristics. In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as \\"an astonishing success story\\". He wrote that \\"Jews are a famously accomplished group,\\" who, because they were \\"forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages ... have been living off their wits ever since\\". In Brooks' view, \\"Israel's technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world.\\" In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in The New York Times titled \\"The Nature of Poverty\\" specifically followed the social uproar caused by the death of Freddie Gray, and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are \\"matters of social psychology\\". When discussing Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was \\"not on the path to upward mobility\\". In regard to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of Hillary Clinton, applauding her ability to be \\"competent\\" and \\"normal\\" in comparison to her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump.PBS News Hour. \\"Shields and Brooks on 'anticlimactic' Clinton victory, Trump's 'moral chasm'.\\" Online video clip. YouTube. YouTube, June 10, 2016. Web. September 20, 2016. In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually be victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become \\"sick of\\" Trump. When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a New York Times op- ed he titled \\"No, Not Trump, Not Ever\\". In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is \\"epically unprepared to be president\\" and by pointing out Trump's \\"steady obliviousness to accuracy\\". On the August 9, 2019 episode of the PBS NewsHour, Brooks suggested Trump may be a sociopath. Social views Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that \\"sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex- saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious\\" by \\"waiting longer to have sex ... [and] having fewer partners\\". He sees the culture war as nearly over, because \\"today's young people ... seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right.\\" As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be \\"in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair\\".The New York Times, April 17, 2005, 4-14 As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same- sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: \\"We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity ... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage.\\" In 2020, Brooks wrote in The Atlantic, under the headline \\"The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake\\", that \\"recent signs suggest at least the possibility that a new family paradigm is emerging,\\" suggesting that in the place of the \\"collapsed\\" nuclear one the \\"extended\\" family emerges, with \\"multigenerational living arrangements\\" that stretch even \\"across kinship lines.\\" Brooks had already started in 2017 a project called \\"Weave\\", in order, as he described it, to \\"support and draw attention to people and organizations around the country who are building community\\" and to \\"repair [America]‚Äôs social fabric, which is badly frayed by distrust, division and exclusion.\\" Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances. He has expressed opposition to the legalization of marijuana, stating that use of the drug causes immoral behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech. Criticisms Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on stereotypes and presenting false claims as factual. In 2004, Sasha Issenberg, writing for Philadelphia magazine, fact-checked Bobos in Paradise, concluding that many of its comments about middle America were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth. He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: \\"He laughed ... '[The book was] partially tongue-in- cheek'...I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of 'taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said.\\" Brooks later said the article made him feel that \\"I suck...I can't remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid.\\" In 2015, Salon found that Brooks had got \\"nearly every detail\\" wrong about a poll of high-school students. Michael Kinsley argued that Brooks was guilty of \\"fearless generalizing ... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke\\". Writing for Gawker, which consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting \\"possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief\\". Furthermore, Annie Lowrey, in writing for the New York magazine, criticized Brooks' statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used \\"some very tricksy, misleading math\\". Additionally, Sean Illing of Slate criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming he argued his point by framing his sources' arguments out of context and routinely making bold \\"half-right\\" assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform. In 2016, James Taranto criticized Brooks' analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court case Dretke v. Haley,Dretke v. Haley, 541 U.S. 386 (2004). writing that \\"Brooks's treatment of this case is either deliberately deceptive or recklessly ignorant\\". Law professor Ann Althouse concurred that Brooks \\"distorts rather grotesquely\\" the case in question.Althouse, Ann. \\"Althouse\\" (January 13, 2016). Brooks was previously criticized by Lyle Denniston with regard to another case, for having \\"scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done\\". Legacy =Sidney Awards= In 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher Sidney Hook and originally called \\"The Hookies\\", the honor was renamed \\"The Sidney Awards\\" in 2005. The awards are presented each December. Personal life Brooks met his first wife, Jane Hughes, while they were students at the University of Chicago. She converted to Judaism and changed her given name to Sarah. In November 2013, they divorced. In 2017, Brooks married his former research assistant, writer Anne Snyder. According to The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, in a September 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Brooks said that his oldest son serves in the Israel Defense Forces. In recent years, Brooks has explored Christianity, although he has not formally converted.

It was founded as the Nashua Daily Telegraph in 1869, although a weekly version dates back to 1832. Through the 2000s it was the second-largest newspaper in the state in terms of daily print circulation, behind only the New Hampshire Union Leader of Manchester. In 2020 The Telegraph reduced its print run to Saturday only, when it produces a weekend edition under the Sunday Telegraph banner. In the announcement, the paper said it will continue to report news for its website every day.INdepthNH: \\"Nashua Telegraph moves mostly online\\" After being family-owned for a century, The Telegraph was bought in the 1980s by Independent Publications of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, which owned several smaller daily and weekly newspapers around the United States as well as some other businesses.http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040917/IPI/40917071 In 2005, the paper's owner bought the Cabinet Press, publisher of weekly newspapers based in nearby Milford, New Hampshire.http://cabinet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/ABOUT/60915001/-1/about In April 2013, it was bought by Ogden Newspapers of Wheeling, West Virginia.  1980 presidential primary debate  On February 23, 1980, the Telegraph received national attention during the New Hampshire presidential primary, when it hosted a Republican debate paid for by the campaign of former California Governor Ronald Reagan. During a discussion over which candidates should be allowed to participate, Telegraph editor Jon Breen (1935‚Äì2017), acting as moderator, ordered sound man Bob Molloy to shut off Reagan's microphone, which was met with shouts of protest from the audience; Molloy refused to comply. Mispronouncing his name, Reagan rebuked Breen saying, \\"I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green!\\" [sic], which was cheered by the audience and applauded by most of his fellow opponents. The phrase entered the political lexicon and the publicity helped to boost Reagan's successful run for the presidency. Reagan later recounted the incident as a \\"brief and seemingly small event, one lasting only a few seconds\\", that he said he thought, \\"helped take me to the White House\\". He continues: Arriving at the debate, Reagan found two seats prepared, one each for himself and for Bush on either side of Breen. The other candidates were confused, as was the audience.

He and a popular agrarian faction argued that reforming Parliament, abolishing \\"rotten boroughs\\", restraining wanton foreign activity and suppressing wages would promote domestic peace and ease the poverty of farm labourers and smallholders. He backed lower taxes, saving, reversing enclosures of commons, and resisting the gold standard of 1821. He sought an end to borough-mongers, sinecurists and \\"tax-eaters\\" (overpaid, sometimes corrupt bureaucrats, public servants and stockbrokers), and dismissed British Jews in a typecast by the same token. Early in life he was a soldier and devotee of king and country, but he later pushed for a radicalism that helped to produce the Reform Act 1832 and gain him one of two seats in Parliament for the newly enfranchised borough of Oldham. He strongly advocated Catholic emancipation. He saw British agriculture and other economic output geographically. His polemics cover subjects from political reform to religion. His best known book is Rural Rides (1830, still in print). He argued against Malthusianism that economic betterment could support global population growth. He coined the phrase \\"a red herring\\". Life =Early life (1763‚Äì1791)= William Cobbett's birthplace. William Cobbett was born in Farnham, Surrey, on 9 March 1763, the third son of George Cobbett, a farmer and publican, and Anne Vincent.Ian Dyck, 'Cobbett, William (1763‚Äì1835)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 23 July 2011. He was taught to read and write by his father and he started working from an early age. He later said: \\"I do not remember a time when I did not earn my living. My first occupation was, driving small birds from the turnip seed, and the rooks from the peas.\\"Daniel Green, Great Cobbett: The Noblest Agitator (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), pp. 18‚Äì19.G. D. H. Cole, The Life of William Cobbett (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1971), p. 16. He worked as a farm labourer at Farnham Castle,Green, Great Cobbett, p. 38.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 16. and also worked briefly as a gardener in the King's garden at Kew.S. Clifford- Smith, \\"William Cobbett: cottager's friend\\", Australian Garden History, 19 (5), 2008, pp. 4‚Äì6.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 17‚Äì18. His rural upbringing gave him a lifelong love of gardening and hunting.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 19, 21 and 30. Cartoon of Cobbett enlisting in the army. From the Political Register of 1809. Artist James Gillray. On 6 May 1783, on a whim, he took a stage coach to London and spent eight or nine months as a clerk in the employ of a Mr Holland at Gray's Inn.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 41‚Äì42.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 22‚Äì23. He joined the 54th (West Norfolk) Regiment of Foot during 1783 and made good use of the soldier's copious spare time to educate himself, particularly in English grammar.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 48‚Äì49. Between 1785 and 1791 Cobbett was stationed with his regiment in New Brunswick and sailed from Gravesend in Kent to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Cobbett was in Saint John, Fredericton and elsewhere in the province until September 1791, being promoted through the ranks to sergeant major, the most senior rank of non-commissioned officer. Cobbett returned to England with his regiment, landing at Portsmouth on 3 November 1791, and obtained his discharge from the army on 19 December 1791. In Woolwich during February 1792, he married the American-born Anne Reid (1774‚Äì1848), whom he had met while stationed at Fort Howe in Saint John.John Robert Colombo Canadian Literary Landmarks p. 47.Jenny's Spring. His children with her were Anne Cobbett (1795‚Äì1877), William Cobbett (1798‚Äì1878), John Morgan Cobbett (1800‚Äì1877), James Paul Cobbett (1803‚Äì1881), Eleanor Cobbett (1805‚Äì1900) and Susan Cobbett (1807‚Äì1889).Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 437. =Refuge in France and the United States (1792‚Äì1800)= Cobbett had developed an animosity towards some corrupt officers and gathered evidence on the matter while in New Brunswick, but his charges against them were ignored. He wrote The Soldier's Friend (1792), protesting against the low pay and harsh treatment of enlisted men in the British army. Sensing that he was about to be indicted in retribution, he fled to France in March 1792 to avoid imprisonment. Cobbett had intended to stay a year to learn the French language, but he found the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars in progress, and so he sailed for the United States in September 1792. He was first at Wilmington, then Philadelphia by the spring of 1793. Cobbett initially prospered by teaching English to Frenchmen and translating texts from French into English. He later claimed that he had become a political writer by accident: during an English lesson one of his French students read aloud from a New York newspaper the addresses of welcome that the Democrats had sent to Joseph Priestley upon his arrival in America, along with Priestley's replies. His student applauded the anti-British sentiments they contained and he quarrelled with Cobbett, who then resolved to \\"write and publish a pamphlet in defence of my country.\\"Green, Great Cobbett, p. 125.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 55. His Observations on the Emigration of Dr Priestley, which was published anonymously in 1794, was a violent attack on the radical Priestley.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 127.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 57‚àí58. In 1795 Cobbett wrote A Bone to Gnaw for the Democrats, which attacked the pro-French Democratic Party.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 59. He replied to his critics with A Kick for a Bite, which was his first work to be published under the pseudonym \\"Peter Porcupine\\" (a reviewer had compared him to a porcupine, which pleased him).Green, Great Cobbett, p. 129. He took the side of the Federalists, who were led by Alexander Hamilton, because they were more friendly to Britain than the pro- French Democrats led by Thomas Jefferson.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 130 and 132‚àí134.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 64. In January 1796 he began a monthly tract, The Censor. This was discontinued after eight numbers and replaced by Porcupine's Gazette, a daily newspaper which ran from March 1797 until the end of 1799.Edward Smith, \\"Cobbett, William\\", Leslie Stephen, ed., Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume XI (1887).Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 59‚àí60. Talleyrand, at the time a French spy in America, failed to bribe Cobbett to join the French cause.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 140.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 63. Cobbett opened a bookstore in Philadelphia in July 1796. He adorned its shop-window with a large portrait of George III and its interior with a huge painting of \\"Lord Howe's Decisive Victory over the French\\". This provocative display attracted considerable publicity and made him famous in America.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 62. He reprinted and published much of the violent loyalist literature then current, including George Chalmers's hostile biography of Thomas Paine.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 147.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 60. After Spain entered into an alliance with France against Britain, Cobbett attacked the Spanish King in Porcupine's Gazette. The Spanish Minister in Philadelphia asked the United States government to prosecute Cobbett for libel on the Spanish King and he was arrested on 18 November 1797. He was tried in the State Court of Pennsylvania by Chief Justice Thomas McKean (who was also the Spanish Minister's father-in-law). Despite McKean's criticism of Cobbett in his summing up, the grand jury threw out the bill against him by a one-vote majority.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 168‚Äì171. Cobbett also campaigned against the physician and abolitionist Benjamin Rush, whose advocacy of bleeding during the yellow fever epidemic may have caused many deaths. pp. 337‚Äì343. Rush won a libel suit against Cobbett, who never fully paid the $8,000 judgement, but instead fled to New York and during 1800 via Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Falmouth, Cornwall.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 170‚Äì175.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 65‚Äì70. The British government was grateful to Cobbett for supporting Britain's interests in America: the Duke of Kent hailed him as \\"this great British patriot\\"; the British representative in America, Robert Liston, offered him a \\"great pecuniary reward\\" (which he turned down), and the Secretary at War, William Windham, said that Cobbett deserved a statue of gold for the services he had rendered to Britain in America.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 141.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 58. =The Political Register (1800‚Äì1810)= Cobbett's American writings had been reprinted in Britain, with John Wright acting as his agent.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 154 and 183.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 58 and 70. In August 1800 Windham invited Cobbett to dinner, where he met the Prime Minister, William Pitt, and contributors to the Anti-Jacobin, including George Canning.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 183.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 70. Pitt's government offered Cobbett the editorship of a government newspaper, but he preferred to remain independent.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 184‚Äì185.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 70‚Äì72. His own paper, The Porcupine, bearing the motto \\"Fear God, Honour the King\\", started up on 30 October 1800, but without success, and he sold his interest in it in 1801. Less than a month later, however, he started the Political Register, a weekly newspaper that appeared almost every week from January 1802 until 1835, the year of Cobbett's death. Windham and French Laurence had suggested the idea of a weekly newspaper to Cobbett and Windham raised the money to fund it by private subscription.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 207. When the British government signed a preliminary peace agreement with France in October 1801, Cobbett emerged as one of its foremost opponents, and in the pages of The Porcupine and in his Letters to Lord Hawkesbury, he denounced the agreement as humiliating to Britain and advantageous to France.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 192.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 75‚Äì77. When news of the ratification arrived on 10 October, Cobbett refused to illuminate the windows of his house in celebration and it was attacked by a mob, which smashed all of its windows.Green, Great Cobbett, p. 197.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 76. When the Peace of Amiens was signed in March 1802, Cobbett again refused to illuminate his windows and the Royal Horse Guards had to protect his house from the mob.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 197‚Äì198. War broke out again between Britain and France in May 1803 and Napoleon planned to invade England, assembling the Grande Arm√©e at Boulogne. In June The Morning Post appealed to all newspapers to print articles for \\"the purpose of arousing the people to the defence of the country\\".Green, Great Cobbett, p. 231. Cobbett immediately began a pamphlet, Important Considerations for the People of the Kingdom, warning the country of the consequences of a French invasion. Cobbett declined an offer of payment from the government and it was published anonymously in July.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 231‚Äì232.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 81. The Prime Minister, Henry Addington, ordered copies to be sent to every parish in England and it had an immediate effect on public opinion.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 232‚Äì235. Cobbett formed a close friendship with Windham, who became his patron and shared his anti-Jacobinism and his love of rural and athletic sports.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 209‚Äì210.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 71. The Evangelical movement was campaigning to reform the sports and recreations of the common people, intending to replace bull- baiting, boxing, singlestick, wrestling and racing with Sunday Schools and psalm singing.Green, Great Cobbett, pp. 218‚Äì219.Ian Dyck, William Cobbett and Rural Popular Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 20‚Äì22. Cobbett in the Register criticised the Evangelicals' hostility to rural and athletic sports, \\"which string the nerves and strengthen the frame, which excite an emulation in deeds of hardihood and valour, and which imperceptibly instill honour, generosity, and a love of glory. Men thus formed are pupils unfit for the puritanical school; therefore it was, that the sect were incessantly labouring to eradicate, fibre by fibre, the last poor remains of English manners.\\"Green, Great Cobbett, p. 219. Cobbett supported Windham in opposing attempts in the House of Commons to introduce Bills against boxing and bull-baiting; he wrote to Windham that the Bill \\"goes to the rearing of puritanism into a system.\\"The Earl of Rosebery (ed.), The Windham Papers. Volume Two (London: Herbert Jenkins Ltd, 1913), p. 234.Lewis Melville, The Life and Letters of William Cobbett in England and America: Volume I (London: J. Lane, 1913), pp. 205‚Äì206. Although initially staunchly anti-Jacobin, by 1804 Cobbett was questioning the policies of the Pitt government, especially the immense national debt and profligate use of sinecures, which Cobbett believed were ruining the country and increasing class antagonism. By 1807 he was endorsing reformers such as Francis Burdett and John Cartwright. Cobbett published the Complete Collection of State Trials between 1804 and 1812 and amassed accounts of parliamentary debates from 1066 onwards, but financial difficulties obliged him to sell his shares in it to T. C. Hansard in 1812. This unofficial record of parliamentary proceedings later became known officially as Hansard. Cobbett intended to campaign for Parliament in Honiton in 1806, but was persuaded by Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald to let him campaign in his stead. Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by \\"buying\\" votes. This situation also encouraged his opposition to rotten boroughs and belief in parliamentary reform.David Cordingly, Cochrane the Dauntless: The Life and Adventures of Thomas Cochrane, Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 2008 (), pp. 105‚Äì113. =Prison (1810‚Äì1812)= The Hampshire hog in the pound Cobbett was found guilty of treasonous libel on 15 June 1810, after objecting in The Register to the flogging at Ely of local militiamen by Hanoverians. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Newgate Prison. While in prison he wrote the pamphlet Paper Against Gold, warning of the dangers of paper money, and also many essays and letters. On his release, a dinner was held in his honour in London, attended by 600 people and directed by Sir Francis Burdett, who like Cobbett was a strong advocate of parliamentary reform. =\\"Two-Penny Trash\\" (1812‚Äì1817)= By 1815 the tax on newspapers had reached four pence a copy. As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising William Wilberforce for his endorsement of the Corn Laws, for his personal wealth and opposition to bull and bear-baiting, and particularly for his approval of \\"the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes\\". In 1816 Cobbett began publishing the Political Register as a pamphlet. It now sold for only two pence and soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \\"two-penny trash\\", a phrase Cobbett adopted. Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner Samuel Bamford later wrote: > At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great > authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the > manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, > and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their > influence was speedily visible. He directed his readers to the true cause of > their sufferings‚Äîmisgovernment; and to its proper corrective‚Äîparliamentary > reform.Samuel Bamford, Bamford's Passages in the Life of a Radical, and > Early Days: Vol. II (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1905), pp. 11‚Äì12.Green, Great > Cobbett, pp. 384‚àí385.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 211. This made Cobbett a dangerous man, and he learnt in 1817 that the government was planning to arrest him for sedition. With the government intending to suspend habeas corpus, and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett again fled to the United States. On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at Liverpool for New York on the ship Importer, with D. Ogden as master, accompanied by his two eldest sons, William and John. =Refuge in the United States (1817‚Äì1819)= Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England, 1930. Cobbett lived for two years on a farm on Long Island, where he wrote Grammar of the English Language and with help from William Benbow, a friend in London, continued to issue the Political Register. He also wrote The American Gardener (1821), one of the earliest horticultural books published in the United States. Cobbett closely observed alcohol- drinking habits in the United States. He stated in 1819, \\"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\\" He believed it would be \\"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\\"Ronald G. Walters, Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol. A plan to return to England with the remains of the British- American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary Thomas Paine (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his New Rochelle, New York farm and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand. Cobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819. =Later life (1819‚Äì1835)= Cobbett's arrival came soon after the Peterloo Massacre. He joined with other radicals in attacks on the government and was charged with libel three times in the next couple of years. The introduction of horse-powered threshing machines to farms was one of the principal causes of the Swing Riots. In 1820, he campaigned for Parliament in Coventry, but finished last in the poll. That year he also founded a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), and with his son, a variety of maize he called \\"Cobbett's corn\\". This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden, which turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety, he issued a book entitled A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn (1828). Meanwhile, he also wrote his popular Cottage Economy (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self- sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing and livestock farming. Not content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work ‚Äì especially on his repeated theme of the plight of rural Englishmen. He began riding about the country observing events in towns and villages. Rural Rides, a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the Political Register from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing it, Cobbett also produced The Woodlands (1825), a book on silviculture. In the first supplement to the Political Register, Cobbett had defended the slave trade as necessary to British commerce. After the Slave Trade Act 1807 prohibited the slave trade, Cobbett wrote in the Register that \\"there is not a reflecting man in the kingdom that cares one straw about it.\\"Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 136. In the Register for 30 August 1823, Cobbett published his Letter to William Wilberforce, an answer to Wilberforce's Appeal to the Religion, Justice and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.Nicole Carroll, 'William Wilberforce and William Cobbett: Reformers in Conflict in Early 19th-Century Britain', Voces Novae, Vol. 2 , Article 9, p. 8. Here, he attacked Wilberforce's support for the Combination Act, which prohibited trade unions among British workers,Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 257‚Äì258. and said: \\"Never have you done one single act, in favour of those labourers, but many and many an act you have done against them.\\" The Letter to Wilberforce was widely distributed in working class areas and gave an impetus to the Combination Act's repeal in 1824.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 258. Cobbett contrasted the Evangelical reformers' campaign for the abolition of black slavery with their support for the \\"factory slavery\\" of British workers.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 259. He argued that black slaves were better fed, clothed and housed than British workers, and were better treated by their masters.Dyck, William Cobbett and Rural Popular Culture, p. 35.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, pp. 259‚Äì260. He wrote: \\"Will not the care, will not the anxiety of a really humane Englishman be directed towards the Whites, instead of towards the Blacks, until, at any rate, the situation of the former be made to be as good as that of the latter?\\" In 1833, Cobbett voted for the abolition of slavery but in the Register he was still contrasting Parliament's concern for black slaves with their indifference to the sufferings of British \\"factory slaves\\".Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 423. Although not a Catholic, Cobbett at this time also advocated the cause of Catholic Emancipation. Between 1824 and 1826, he published his History of the Protestant Reformation, a broadside against the traditional Protestant historical narrative of the reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of Parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend Mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies. Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.

In 1829, Cobbett published Advice To Young Men, in which he criticised An Essay on the Principle of Population by the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus. That year he also published The English Gardener, which he later updated and expanded. This book has been compared favourably with other contemporary garden tomes, such as John Claudius Loudon's Encyclop√¶dia of Gardening.Clifford-Smith, S., \\"William Cobbett: cottager's friend\\", Australian Garden History, 19 (5), 2008, pp. 4‚Äì6. Cobbett continued to publish controversy in the Political Register and was charged in July 1831 with seditious libel for a pamphlet entitled Rural War, endorsing the Captain Swing Riots, in which rioters were smashing farm machinery and burning haystacks. Cobbett successfully conducted his own defence.State Trials (New Series) II, 789. Cobbett still sought to be elected to the House of Commons. He was defeated in Preston in 1826 and in Manchester in 1832, but after the passage of the Reform Act 1832, Cobbett won the seat of Oldham. In Parliament, Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the 1834 Poor Law. He believed that the poor had a right to a share in the community's wealth and that the Old Poor Law was the last remaining right that English workers possessed, and which set them apart from other countries which had no such provision.Green,Great Cobbett, pp. 458‚Äì459.Dyck, William Cobbett and Rural Popular Culture, pp. 208‚Äì209. Because the New Poor Law deprived the people of this right to relief, Cobbett believed that the social contract was broken and that therefore the duty of allegiance was dissolved.Dyck, William Cobbett and Rural Popular Culture, p. 208. In the week before his death, he wrote to a friend: \\"[B]efore the passing of the Poor-Law Bill, I wished to avoid [a] convulsive termination. I now do not wish it to be avoided.\\" During later life, however, Thomas Macaulay, a fellow MP, remarked that Cobbett's faculties were impaired by age; indeed that his paranoia had reached insanity. From 1831 until his death, Cobbett managed a farm named Ash in the village of Normandy, Surrey, a few miles from his birthplace at Farnham. Cobbett died there after a brief illness in June 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Parish Church, Farnham. Parliamentary career During his lifetime Cobbett campaigned for parliament five times, of which four attempts were unsuccessful: *1806 Honiton *1820 Coventry *1826 Preston *1832 Manchester In 1832 he was successfully elected as a member for Oldham. Legacy The tomb of William Cobbett in the churchyard of St Andrew's church in Farnham. Cobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist, who angered by the corrupt British political establishment, became increasingly radical and sympathetic to anti- government and democratic ideals. He provided an exegis for rural England in the age of an Industrial Revolution, with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born. Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a \\"citizen of world.... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland.\\" Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not \\"swagger about and be saucy to England.\\" He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it \\"bears the name of my country.\\" Among historian biographers, Ian Dyck (died 2007) claimed that Cobbett endorsed \\"the eighteenth-century Country Party platform\\";Ian Dyck, 'Introduction' in William Cobbett, Rural Rides (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. xxiii. Edward Tangye Lean (died 1974) described him as \\"an archaic English Tory\\".Edward Tangye Lean, The Napoleonists. A Study in Political Disaffection. 1760‚Äì1960 (London: Oxford University Press, 1970), p. 206. Cobbett has been praised by thinkers of various political persuasions, such as Matthew Arnold, Karl Marx, G. K. Chesterton, A. J. P. Taylor, Raymond Williams, E. P. Thompson and Michael Foot. A story by Cobbett issued in 1807 coined the term \\"red herring\\", to mean a distraction from an important issue.Martin Chilton, William Cobbett: forgotten chronicler of England, The Telegraph, 9 March 2015. Cobbett's sons were trained as barristers and founded a partnership in Manchester named Cobbetts in his honour. The firm dissolved in 2013. His second son John Morgan Cobbett (1800‚Äì1877) followed him into politics and like his father became MP for Oldham.Cole, Life of William Cobbett, p. 436. Cobbett's birthplace, a public house in Farnham once named The Jolly Farmer, has been renamed The William Cobbett. The Brooklyn-based history band Pi√±ataland performed a song about William Cobbett's quest to rebury Thomas Paine entitled \\"An American Man\\". An equestrian statue of Cobbett was being planned for a site in Farnham,BBC Home town plans statue of Cobbett 21 January 2009Waverley Borough Council Committee Document William Cobbett Statue which already has the William Cobbett Junior School named in his honour; its logo is a porcupine. After Cobbett's death, Benjamin Tilly, who had served Cobbett as companion, secretary and factotum, initiated the Cobbett Club. Members sent petitions to Parliament demanding radical reform and produced radical pamphlets and leaflets to keep Cobbett's politics alive. Some of these are still available in libraries. The William Cobbett Society, based in Farnham, produces a yearly edition of 'Cobbett's New Register', and celebrates Cobbett's life, works and spirit in various activities, including an annual Rural Ride and lecture.

It is part of the Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites UNESCO World Heritage Site. At high, it is the tallest prehistoric man-made mound in EuropeAtkinson 1967. and one of the largest in the world; similar in size to some of the smaller Egyptian pyramids of the Giza Necropolis.Malone (1989), p. 95. Silbury Hill is part of the complex of Neolithic monuments around Avebury, which includes the Avebury Ring and West Kennet Long Barrow. Its original purpose is still debated. Several other important Neolithic monuments in Wiltshire in the care of English Heritage, including the large henges at Marden and Stonehenge, may be culturally or functionally related to Avebury and Silbury. Structure Seen from near Swallowhead Springs Composed mainly of chalk and clay excavated from the surrounding area, the mound stands high The measurement is taken from the present ground level at the top of silt that has accumulated in the trench surrounding the tumulus, to a depth of nine meters (Atkinson 1974:127). and covers about . The hill was constructed in several stages between 24002300 BC and displays immense technical skill and prolonged control over labour and resources. Archaeologists calculate that it took 18 million man-hours, equivalent to 500 men working for 15 years (Atkinson 1974:128) to deposit and shape of earth and fill. Euan W. Mackie asserts that no simple late Neolithic tribal structure as usually imagined could have sustained this and similar projects, and envisages an authoritarian theocratic power elite with broad- ranging control across southern Britain.Mackie, Science and Society in Prehistoric Britain (New York: St. Martin's Press) 1977. The base of the hill is circular and in diameter. The summit is flat-topped and in diameter. A smaller mound was constructed first, and in a later phase much enlarged. The initial structures at the base of the hill were perfectly circular: surveying reveals that the centre of the flat top and the centre of the cone that describes the hill lie within a metre of one another.Atkinson 1974 p. 128 There are indications that the top originally had a rounded profile, but this was flattened in the medieval period to provide a base for a building, perhaps with a defensive purpose. The first clear evidence of construction, dated to around 2400 BC consisted of a gravel core with a revetting kerb of stakes and sarsen boulders. Alternate layers of chalk rubble and earth were placed on top of this: the second phase involved heaping further chalk on top of the core, using material excavated from a series of surrounding ditches which were progressively refilled then recut several metres further out. The step surrounding the summit dates from this phase of construction, either as a precaution against slippage, or as the remnants of a spiral path ascending from the base, used during construction to raise materials and later as a processional route. Investigations Silbury Hill, as viewed from the nearby hill on which West Kennet Long Barrow is located. Silbury Hill, artistic reconstruction c. 2350 BC. =17th, 18th and 19th centuries= There have been several excavations of the mound. The site was first illustrated by the seventeenth-century antiquarian John Aubrey, whose notes, in the form of his Monumenta Britannica, were published between 1680 and 1682. Later, William Stukeley wrote that a skeleton and bridle had been discovered during tree planting on the summit in 1723. It is probable that this was a later, secondary burial. The excavation came in October 1776 when a team of Cornish miners overseen by the Duke of Northumberland and Colonel Edward Drax sank a vertical shaft from the top.Kerton, Nigel \\"Long lost theory on Silbury Hill is uncovered\\" Gazette and Herald 2 February 2010 In 1849 a tunnel was dug horizontally from the edge into the centre. Other excavations were undertaken in 1867 and 1886. =20th century= Flinders Petrie investigated the hill after the First World War. In 1968 to 1970 professor Richard J. C. Atkinson undertook work at Silbury which was broadcast on BBC Television. This excavation revealed most of the environmental evidence known about the site, including the remains of winged ants which indicate that Silbury was begun in an August. Atkinson dug numerous trenches at the site and reopened the 1849 tunnel, where he found material suggesting a Neolithic date, although none of his radiocarbon dates are considered reliable by modern standards. He argued that the hill was constructed in steps, each tier being filled in with packed chalk and then smoothed off or weathered into a slope. Atkinson reported the C 14 date for the base layer of turf and decayed material indicated a corrected date for the commencement of Silbury was close to 2750 BC.'Prehistoric Avebury' by Aubrey Burl, Yale University press, 1979, page 129 =21st century= After heavy rains in May 2002, a collapse of the 1776 excavation shaft caused a hole to form in the top of the hill. English Heritage undertook a seismic survey of the hill to identify the damage caused by earlier excavations and determine the hill's stability. Repairs were undertaken but the site remained closed to the public. As part of this remedial work English Heritage excavated two further small trenches at the summit and made the important discovery of an antler fragment, the first from a secure archaeological context at the site. A radiocarbon date of c. 2490-2340 BC dates the second phase of the mound convincingly to the Late Neolithic. Other recent work has focused on the role of the surrounding ditch, which may not have been merely a source of chalk for the hill but a purpose-built moat placed between the hill and the rest of the world. In March 2007, English Heritage announced that a Roman village the size of 24 football pitches had been found at the foot of Silbury Hill. It contained regularly laid out streets and houses.Reuters News. On 11 May 2007, contractors Skanska, under the overall direction of English Heritage, began a major programme of stabilisation, filling the tunnels and shafts from previous investigations with hundreds of tonnes of chalk. At the same time a new archaeological survey was conducted using modern equipment and techniques.BBC News ‚Äì Tunnel open again at Silbury hill The work finished in Spring 2008: a \\"significant\\" new understanding of the monument's construction and history had been obtained. In February 2010, letters written by Edward Drax concerning the 1776 excavation were found in the British Library describing a \\"perpendicular cavity\\" wide. As wood fragments thought to be oak have been found it has been suggested that this may have held an oak tree or a \\"totem pole\\".\\"Letters suggest Silbury Hill 'built around totem pole'\\" 3 February 2010 =Comparable sites= Silbury Hill in Wiltshire Following the 2007-8 works the archaeologists raised the question of whether Silbury Hill was the only such mound built by the people of the time, or if there might be other comparable mounds that have not been recognised as prehistoric. A strong candidate was felt to be the Marlborough Mound, in the grounds of Marlborough College, east of Silbury Hill, downstream on the same River Kennet. The mound is high, so less than half the height of Silbury. There are archaeological and documentary indications that the Marlborough Mound had been used for medieval fortifications, and it had been assumed it was built as a Norman motte. However, the team of archaeologists, led by Jim Leary, arranged for core samples from two 10 cm diameter boreholes to be analysed. Charcoal found immediately below the mound showed it had been built in or around the period following 2500 BC, making it a close contemporary of Silbury. Another contender, but which had been all-but levelled in the 19th century, was at Marden Henge, south of Silbury. Known as Hatfield Barrow, a surviving fragment of what may have been a 15 m high mound also gave construction dates to the mid third millennium BC. The Round Mound Project, to investigate other likely mounds, was begun in 2015, and from 154 potential motte sites across England, 20 were selected for core sampling and detailed surveying. By late 2017 fourteen of these mottes had produced results confirming that they were indeed built in the years immediately after the Norman invasion of 1066. Three were shown to be later medieval mounds and one dated from Saxon times, so may be a burial mound. Only one, Skipsea Castle mound in East Yorkshire, was found to be prehistoric, but dating to 800-400 BC, during the British Iron Age. On the basis of this survey, it would appear that neolithic mound building was restricted to the upper Kennet and Avon valleys, and that nothing elsewhere in Britain comes even close as a comparison to Silbury Hill. =Artefacts= Few prehistoric artefacts have ever been found on Silbury Hill: at its core there is only clay, flints, turf, moss, topsoil, gravel, freshwater shells, mistletoe, oak, hazel, sarsen stones, ox bones, and antler tines. Roman and medieval items have been found on and around the site since the nineteenth century and it seems that the hill was reoccupied by later peoples. Purpose Aerial view of Silbury Hill and the A4 road The exact purpose of the hill is unknown, though various suggestions have been put forward: =Folklore= According to legend, Silbury is the last resting place of a King Sil, represented in a lifesize gold statue and sitting on a golden horse. A local legend noted in 1913Robt. M. Heanley, \\"Silbury Hill\\" Folklore 24.4 (December 1913), p. 524 states that the Devil was carrying a bag of soil to drop on the citizens of Marlborough, but he was stopped by the priests of nearby Avebury. In 1861 it was reportedIn Wilts Archaeological Magazine December 1861 p 181, noted by J. B. Partridge, \\"Wiltshire Folklore\\" Folklore 26.2 (June 1915), p 212. that hundreds of people from Kennet, Avebury, Overton and the neighbouring villages thronged Silbury Hill every Palm Sunday. =Other suggestions= John C. Barret asserts that although we no longer know what was at the top of Silbury Hill and cannot suggest what specific rituals or beliefs were associated with it, we can tease out basic spatial concepts.Barret, John. 1994. Fragments from Antiquity: An archaeology of social life in Britain 2900-1200BC. Blackwell, Oxford. pp29-31 He notes that any ritual at Silbury Hill would have involved physically raising a few individuals far above the level of everyone else. These few individuals in a privileged position would have been visible for miles around and at several other monuments in the area. This would possibly indicate an elite group, perhaps a priesthood, powerfully displaying their authority. Michael Dames has put forward a composite theory of seasonal rituals, in an attempt to explain the purpose of Silbury Hill and its associated sites (West Kennet Long Barrow, the Avebury henge, The Sanctuary and Windmill Hill), from which the summit of Silbury Hill is visible.Dames, The Silbury Treasure Paul Devereux observes that Silbury and its surrounding monuments appear to have been designed with a system of inter-related sightlines, focusing on the step several metres below the summit. From various surrounding barrows and from Avebury, the step aligns with hills on the horizon behind Silbury, or with the hills in front of Silbury, leaving only the topmost part visible. In the latter case, Devereux hypothesises that ripe cereal crops grown on the intervening hill would perfectly cover the upper portion of Silbury, with the top of the corn and the top of Silbury coinciding. Jim Leary and David Field (2010) Leary, Jim and Field, David, 2010 The Story Of Silbury Hill, English Heritage, Swindon provide an overview of the evolving archaeological information and interpretations of the site and conclude that the actual purpose of this artificial earth mound (tumulus) cannot be known and the multiple and overlapping construction phases ‚Äì almost continuous remodelling ‚Äì suggest there was no blueprint and that the process of building was probably the most important thing of all: perhaps the process was more important than the Hill. Location Silbury Hill with associated archaeological sites in the Avebury region ca. 2600 to 2300 BC Silbury Hill is located in the Kennet Valley, at OSGB grid reference SU099685 (). It is close to the A4, between the towns of Marlborough and Calne, also the route of a Roman road which runs between Beckhampton and West Kennet and runs to the south of the hill. In 1867 the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society excavated the east side of the hill to see if traces of the Roman Road were underneath it. No traces were found and later excavations south of the hill located the road in fields to the south making a pronounced swerve to avoid the base of the hill. This was conclusive proof that the hill was there before the road ‚Äì but the hill provided an alignment sight-line for the road.\\"Silbury Hill\\", BBC Publications 1969 - Refers to the excavations for the BBC TV programme dealing with the new 1968/1969 excavations for BBC2 TV programmes about the hill. Biology The hill's vegetation is species-rich chalk grassland, dominated by upright brome and false oat-grass, but with many species characteristic of this habitat, including a strong population of the rare knapweed broomrape. This vegetation has led to a area of the site being notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, this notification initially being given in 1965. The site is unique in that its slopes have 360-degree aspects, allowing comparison between growth of the flora on the differently-facing slopes of the hill.

It is based on the same principle as sampling. However, the samples are not played back conventionally, but are instead split into small pieces of around 1 to 50 ms. These small pieces are called grains. Multiple grains may be layered on top of each other, and may play at different speeds, phases, volume, and frequency, among other parameters. At low speeds of playback, the result is a kind of soundscape, often described as a cloud, that is manipulatable in a manner unlike that for natural sound sampling or other synthesis techniques. At high speeds, the result is heard as a note or notes of a novel timbre. By varying the waveform, envelope, duration, spatial position, and density of the grains, many different sounds can be produced. Both have been used for musical purposes: as sound effects, raw material for further processing by other synthesis or digital signal processing effects, or as complete musical works in their own right. Conventional effects that can be achieved include amplitude modulation and time stretching. More experimentally, stereo or multichannel scattering, random reordering, disintegration and morphing are possible.

Cincinnatus was a conservative opponent of the rights of the plebeians (the common citizens) who fell into poverty because of his son's violent opposition to their desire for a written code of equitably enforced laws. Despite his old age, he worked his own small farm until an invasion prompted his fellow citizens to call for his leadership. He came from his plow to assume complete control over the state but, upon achieving a swift victory, relinquished his power and its perquisites and returned to his farm. His success and immediate resignation of his near-absolute authority with the end of this crisis (traditionally dated to 458BC) has often been cited as an example of outstanding leadership, service to the greater good, civic virtue, humility, and modesty. As a result, he has inspired a number of organizations and other entities, some named in his honor. In the United States, parallels are drawn between Cincinnatus and national hero George Washington, and, as such, the Society of the Cincinnati, the town of Cincinnatus, New York, and (indirectly) the city of Cincinnati, Ohio are named after him. Modern historians question some particulars of the story recounted in Livy and elsewhere but usually accept Cincinnatus as a historical figure who served as suffect consul in 460BC and as dictator in 458BC and (possibly) again in 439BC, when the patricians called on him to suppress the feared uprising of the plebeians under Spurius Maelius, after which he ceded power and famously resigned. Life According to the traditional accounts, Lucius would have been born about 519BC, during the last decade of the Roman Kingdom. He would have been a member of the lesser patrician clan (') Quinctia, whom Tullus Hostilius supposedly moved to Rome from the Latin city of Alba Longa. The clan's first consul was Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus, elected in 471BC. As both Titus and Lucius are recorded as the son and grandson of men named Lucius Quinctius, Titus is sometimes thought to have been Lucius's brother. This suggests Lucius was the first of his cognomen ', meaning \\"the curly haired\\". The family was relatively rich. In the late 460sBC, Rome was fending off raids by the Aequi to their east and, beginning in 462BC, the tribune G. Terentilius Harsa began pressing for codification of the Roman laws in order to establish a kind of constitution that would check the near-regal power of the patrician consuls. In the years that followed, he and the other plebeians were ignored, fended off, rejected on procedural grounds, and finally beaten and driven from the streets by gangs of patricians and their clients, supposedly including Cincinnatus's son Caeso. The violent resistance of the patricians to such a blameless request prompted so much unrest that Appius Herdonius was able to seize the Capitoline Hill and hold it against the city with a gang of outlaws and rebel slaves (in Livy) or with an army of Sabines (in Dionysius). The consul Publius Valerius Poplicola was killed in its recovery in 460BC and Cincinnatus, probably illegally, became the suffect (\\"replacement\\") consul for the remainder of the year. Cincinnatus was himself a violent opponent of the plebs' proposal, which made no progress during his administration. His son was supposedly driven from town and killed for his murder of a plebeian. Cincinnatus quit the city and retired to an estate he held to the west of the Tiber. Cincinnatus served as dictator, a king-like figure appointed by the Republic in times of extreme emergency, in 458 or 457BC in order to lead reinforcements to the defense of the Roman army under the consul L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus at Mount Algidus. Many of the details of the story are now assumed to be spurious and some consider the entire military account fictional, believing its parallels with T. Quinctius Cincinnatus's 380BC defeat of Praeneste and Fabius the Delayer's 217BC rescue of M. Minucius Rufus from Hannibal too great for chance. Cincinnatus is recorded, having taken advantage of his position as dictator, to ignore the objections of the tribunes and to charge his son's accuser Marcus Volscius for perjury, driving him into exile. During the decemvirate, he ran unsuccessfully for a position in their government in 450BC but Livy notes his involvement in the discussion about opening the consulship to plebeians. Possibly, he returned as dictator in 439BC to defend Rome against the conspiracy the prefect L. Minucius Augurinus alleged Spurius Maelius was plotting against the Republic. When Spurius Maelius ignored his summons, he was killed by Cincinnatus's master of horse and any plot collapsed. He presumably died sometime soon afterwards. Legend =Son= sculpture of Cincinnatus in Vienna's Sch√∂nbrunn Garden In the traditional accounts of the story, Cincinnatus's son Caeso was an openly violent opponent of the attempts of the plebeians to enact the Terentilian Law, which sought to codify the Roman legal tradition and circumscribe the authority of the patrician consuls. Caeso would lead gangs to drive the Tribunes of the Plebs from the Forum, disrupting the procedures necessary to approve it. He was brought up on capital charges in 461BC but released on a large bail. A plebeian named Marcus Volscius testified that his brother, while feeble from sickness, had been knocked down and injured by Caeso with such force that he later died. Rather than face his accusers in court, Caeso fled to the Etruscans. He was then condemned to death in absentia and his father subjected to a huge punitive fine, forcing him to sell most of his estates and to retire from public life to personally work a small farm (some accounts say Caeso was killed with Poplicola in the recovery of the Capitoline from Herdonius). Modern historians particularly reject the fine as a later invention inserted to explain the dictator's supposed poverty and heighten his virtues. Some reject the story in its entirety. =First dictatorship= Juan Antonio Ribera's Cincinnatus Leaves the Plough to Dictate Laws to Rome Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus by Denis Foyatier (1793‚Äì1863) Tuileries Garden, Paris In 458BC, the Aequi to Rome's east broke their treaty of the year before and attempted to retake Tusculum (Frascati). The consuls for the year‚ÄîL. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus and G. Nautius Rutilus‚Äîled out two armies, one to Tusculum's relief and another to strike against the lands of the Aequi and their Sabine allies. Upon reaching Mount Algidus in the Alban Hills, the army under L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus encamped and rested instead of immediately attacking. The Aequi quickly deployed around their position and successfully besieged them, with only five horsemen escaping to tell the Roman Senate what had happened. With the army of the second consul unable to help, the senators fell into a panic and authorized the nomination of a dictator. G. Nautius Rutilus or Horatius Pulvillus named Cincinnatus for a term of six months. A group of senators was sent to Cincinnatus to inform him of his appointment, finding him while he was plowing his farm. He asked them, \\"Is everything all right?\\" and they replied that they hoped \\"it might turn out well for both him and his country\\", asking that he don his senatorial toga before hearing the Senate's mandate. He then called out to his wife Racilia, telling her to bring his toga from their cottage. Once he was properly dressed, the delegation hailed him as a dictator and ordered him to come to the city. He crossed the Tiber in one of the senate's boats and was greeted on his return by his three sons and most of the senators. Several lictors were given to him for protection and enforcement of his orders. The next morning, Cincinnatus went to the Forum and named Lucius Tarquitius as his master of the horse. He then went to the assembly of the people and ordered every man of military age to appear on the Field of Mars (Campus Martius) by the end of the day with twelve times the normal amount of encamping spikes. They then marched to the relief of the consul's relieving army. At the Battle of Mount Algidus, they used their spikes to quickly besiege the besieging Aequi. Rather than slaughter them between the two Roman camps, Cincinnatus accepted their pleas for mercy and offered an amnesty provided that three principal offenders were executed and Gracchus Cloelius and their other leaders be delivered to him in chains. A \\"yoke\\" of three spears was then set up and the Aequi made to pass under it as an act of submission, bowing and admitting their defeat. Cincinnatus then disbanded his army and returned to his farm, abandoning his control a mere fifteen days after it had been granted to him. =Second dictatorship= Beccafumi's Ahala, Master of the Horse, Presents the Dead Maelius to Cincinnatus, a fresco in Siena's Public Palace On the nomination of his brother or nephew Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus, Cincinnatus came out of retirement for a second term as dictator in 439BC to deal with the feared plot of the wealthy plebeian Spurius Maelius to buy the loyalty of the poor and establish himself as king over Rome. Cincinnatus named C. Servilius Ahala his master of the horse and directed him to bring Spurius Maelius before him. He and the other patricians then garrisoned the Capitoline Hill and other strongholds around the city. Maelius fended off Ahala's officer with a butcher's knife and fled into a crowd. Ahala led a band of patricians into the crowd and killed him during his flight. With the crisis resolved, Cincinnatus again resigned his commission, having served 21 days (Ahala was later brought to trial for exceeding his commission and accepted voluntary exile). Various aspects of the story are connected with dubious etiological legends and it may have no more connection to the dictator of 458BC than the fact that the consul for the year was a member of the same clan. =Other legends= Cincinnatus became a legend to the Romans. Twice granted supreme power, he held onto it for not a day longer than absolutely necessary. He consistently demonstrated great honorability and integrity. The high esteem in which he was held by the later Romans is sometimes extended to his compatriots. One legend from the end of his life claims a Capitolinus defended one of his sons from a charge of military incompetence by asking the jury who would go to tell the aged Cincinnatus the news in the event of a conviction. The son was said to have been acquitted because the jury could not bring itself to break the old man's heart. Legacy Cincinnati, the 29th- largest city in the United States The statue of Cincinnatus in Paris's Tuileries Garden Many Italian cities have plazas, streets, or other locations named after Cincinnatus (). The Cincinnato neighborhood in Anzio, Italy is named in his honor. The legend of Cincinnatus's selfless service for his country has continued to inspire admiration. It has also been invoked to honor other political leaders, notably George Washington. Washington's relinquishing of control of the Continental Army, refusal to consider establishing a monarchy or assuming monarchical powers, and voluntary retirement after two terms as president to return to his farm at Mount Vernon have made allusions to Cincinnatus common in historical and literary treatments of the era. The Society of the Cincinnati was established by Henry Knox in 1783 to assist the officers of the Continental Army and Navy and their families; to preserve the ideals of the American Revolution; and to maintain the union of the former colonies. A French Society of the Cincinnati was founded soon afterward by King Louis XVI. Cincinnati, Ohio and Cincinnatus, New York, in the United States, were named in its honor.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 9th ed. (1878), Vol. V, \\"Cincinnati\\".

It is named after the eighteenth century French physicist Jean- Baptiste Biot (1774‚Äì1862), and gives a simple index of the ratio of the heat transfer resistances inside of a body and at the surface of a body. This ratio determines whether or not the temperatures inside a body will vary significantly in space, while the body heats or cools over time, from a thermal gradient applied to its surface. TOC In general, problems involving small Biot numbers (much smaller than 1) are thermally simple, due to uniform temperature fields inside the body. Biot numbers much larger than 1 indicate more difficult problems due to non-uniformity of temperature fields within the object. It should not be confused with Nusselt number, which employs the thermal conductivity of the fluid and hence is a comparative measure of conduction and convection, both in the fluid. The Biot number has a variety of applications, including transient heat transfer and use in extended surface heat transfer calculations. Definition The Biot number is defined as: :\\\\mathrm{Bi} = \\\\frac{h}{k} L where: * {k} is the thermal conductivity of the body [W/(m¬∑K)] * {h} is a convective heat transfer coefficient [W/(m2¬∑K)] * {L} is a characteristic length [m] of the geometry considered. The characteristic length in most of relevant problems becomes the heat characteristic length, i.e. the ratio between the body volume and the heated (or cooled) surface of the body: \\\\mathit{L} = \\\\frac{V}{A_\\\\mathrm{Q}} Here, Q for heat is used to denote that the surface to be considered is only the portion of the total surface through which the heat Q passes. The physical significance of Biot number can be understood by imagining the heat flow from a small hot metal sphere suddenly immersed in a pool, to the surrounding fluid. The heat flow experiences two resistances: the first within the solid metal (which is influenced by both the size and composition of the sphere), and the second at the surface of the sphere. If the thermal resistance of the fluid/sphere interface exceeds that thermal resistance offered by the interior of the metal sphere, the Biot number will be less than one. For systems where it is much less than one, the interior of the sphere may be presumed to be a uniform temperature, although this temperature may be changing, as heat passes into the sphere from the surface. The equation to describe this change in (relatively uniform) temperature inside the object, is simple exponential one described in Newton's law of cooling. In contrast, the metal sphere may be large, causing the characteristic length to increase to the point that the Biot number is larger than one. Now, thermal gradients within the sphere become important, even though the sphere material is a good conductor. Equivalently, if the sphere is made of a thermally insulating (poorly conductive) material, such as wood or styrofoam, the interior resistance to heat flow will exceed that of the fluid/sphere boundary, even with a much smaller sphere. In this case, again, the Biot number will be greater than one. Applications Values of the Biot number smaller than 0.1 imply that the heat conduction inside the body is much faster than the heat convection away from its surface, and temperature gradients are negligible inside of it. This can indicate the applicability (or inapplicability) of certain methods of solving transient heat transfer problems. For example, a Biot number less than 0.1 typically indicates less than 5% error will be present when assuming a lumped-capacitance model of transient heat transfer (also called lumped system analysis). Typically this type of analysis leads to simple exponential heating or cooling behavior (\\"Newtonian\\" cooling or heating) since the amount of thermal energy (loosely, amount of \\"heat\\") in the body is directly proportional to its temperature, which in turn determines the rate of heat transfer into or out of it. This leads to a simple first-order differential equation which describes heat transfer in these systems. Having a Biot number smaller than 0.1 labels a substance as \\"thermally thin,\\" and temperature can be assumed to be constant throughout the material's volume. The opposite is also true: A Biot number greater than 0.1 (a \\"thermally thick\\" substance) indicates that one cannot make this assumption, and more complicated heat transfer equations for \\"transient heat conduction\\" will be required to describe the time-varying and non-spatially-uniform temperature field within the material body. Analytic methods for handling these problems, which may exist for simple geometric shapes and uniform material thermal conductivity, are described in the article on the heat equation. Examples of verified analytic solutions along with precise numerical values are available. Often such problems are too difficult to be done except numerically, with the use of a computer model of heat transfer. The heat transfer study of micro- encapsulated Phase-change slurry is one application where the Biot number comes in handy; for the dispersed phase of the micro-encapsulated Phase-change slurry, the micro-encapsulated Phase-change material itself, the Biot number is calculated to be below 0.1 and so it can be assumed that there are no thermal gradient within the dispersed phase. Together with the Fourier number, the Biot number can be used in transient conduction problems in a lumped parameter solution, which can be written as, :{T - T_\\\\infty \\\\over T_0 - T_\\\\infty} = e^{\\\\mathrm{-BiFo}} Mass transfer analogue An analogous version of the Biot number (usually called the \\"mass transfer Biot number\\", or \\\\mathrm{Bi}_m) is also used in mass diffusion processes: :\\\\mathrm{Bi}_m=\\\\frac{k_c}{D} L where: *{k_c} : convective mass transfer coefficient (analogous to the h of the heat transfer problem) *D : mass diffusivity (analogous to the k of heat transfer problem) *{L} : characteristic length See also * Convection * Fourier number * Heat conduction References Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics Dimensionless numbers of thermodynamics Heat conduction ","title":"Biot number"},{"id":"175838","text":"In theology, the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is without parts. The general idea can be stated in this way: The being of God is identical to the \\"attributes\\" of God. Characteristics such as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc., are identical to God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities inhering in God as in a substance; in other words we can say that in God both essence and existence are one and the same. Varieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of scholasticism, although the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' Enneads as the Simplex.Bussanich John, Plotinus's metaphysics of the One in The Cambridge Companion to Plotinus, ed. Lloyd P.Gerson, p.42, 1996, Cambridge University Press, UK. For instances, see Plotinus, Second Ennead, Fourth Tractate, Section 8 (Stephen MacKenna's translation, Sacred Texts)Plotinus, Fifth Ennead, Fourth Tractate, Section 1 (MacKenna's translation, Sacred Texts)Plotinus, Second Ennead, Ninth Tractate, Section 1 (MacKenna's translation, Sacred Texts). In Jewish thought In Jewish philosophy and in Kabbalah, divine simplicity is addressed via discussion of the attributes () of God, particularly by Jewish philosophers within the Muslim sphere of influence such as Saadia Gaon, Bahya ibn Paquda, Yehuda Halevi, and Maimonides, as well by Raabad III in Provence. A classic expression of this position is found in Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed, According to Maimonides, then, there can be no plurality of faculties, moral dispositions, or essential attributes in God. Even to say that God is all- knowing, all-powerful, and all-good is to introduce plurality, if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes. Maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that God's power is greater than ours, that God's life is more permanent than ours, or that God's knowledge is broader than ours. Maimonedes believed that statements such as \\"God lives\\" or \\"God is powerful\\" are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion, but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations. Still, Maimonedes also believed that negation is objectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity: God is neither this nor that, and ultimately any kind of verbal expression fails us. Citing Psalm 65, Maimonides concludes that the highest form of praise we can give God is silence. Some identify divine simplicity as a corollary of Divine Creation: \\"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth\\" (Genesis 1:1). God, as creator is by definition separate from the universe and thus free of any property (and hence an absolute unity); see Negative theology. For others, conversely, the axiom of Divine Unity (see Shema Yisrael) informs the understanding of divine simplicity. Bahya ibn Paquda (Duties of the Heart 1:8) points out that God's Oneness is \\"true oneness\\" (◊î◊ê◊ó◊ì ◊î◊ê◊û◊™) as opposed to merely \\"circumstantial oneness\\" (◊î◊ê◊ó◊ì ◊î◊û◊ß◊®◊ô). He develops this idea to show that an entity which is truly one must be free of properties and thus indescribable ‚Äì and unlike anything else. (Additionally such an entity would be absolutely unsubject to change, as well as utterly independent and the root of everything.) The implication ‚Äì of either approach ‚Äì is so strong that the two concepts are often presented as synonymous: \\"God is not two or more entities, but a single entity of a oneness even more single and unique than any single thing in creation‚Ä¶ He cannot be sub-divided into different parts -- therefore, it is impossible for Him to be anything other than one. It is a positive commandment to know this, for it is written (Deuteronomy 6:4) '‚Ä¶the Lord is our God, the Lord is one'.\\" (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Mada 1:7.) Despite its apparent simplicity, this concept is recognised as raising many difficulties. In particular, insofar as God's simplicity does not allow for any structure -- even conceptually -- divine simplicity appears to entail the following dichotomy. * On the one hand, God is absolutely simple, containing no element of form or structure, as above. * On the other hand, it is understood that God's essence contains every possible element of perfection: \\"The First Foundation is to believe in the existence of the Creator, blessed be He. This means that there exists a Being that is perfect (complete) in all ways and He is the cause of all else that exists.\\" (Maimonides 13 principles of faith, First Principle). The resultant paradox is famously articulated by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (Derekh Hashem I:1:5), describing the dichotomy as arising out of our inability to comprehend the idea of absolute unity: The Kabbalists address this paradox by explaining that ‚ÄúGod created a spiritual dimension‚Ä¶ [through which God] interacts with the Universe... It is this dimension which makes it possible for us to speak of God‚Äôs multifaceted relationship to the universe without violating the basic principle of His unity and simplicity‚Äù (Aryeh Kaplan, Innerspace). The Kabbalistic approach is explained in various Chassidic writings; see for example, Shaar Hayichud, below, for a detailed discussion. In Christian thought In Western Christian classical theism, God is simple, not composite, not made up of thing upon thing. Thomas Morris notes that divine simplicity can mean any or all of three different claims: #God has no spatial parts (spatial simplicity). #God has no temporal parts (temporal simplicity). #God is without the sort of metaphysical complexity where God would have different parts which are distinct from himself (property simplicity). In other words, property simplicity (or metaphysical simplicity) states that the characteristics of God are not parts of God that together make up God. God is simple; God is those characteristics. For example, God does not have goodness but simply is goodness. Spatial simplicity is endorsed by the vast majority of traditional Christian theists (who do not consider God to be a physical object). Temporal simplicity is endorsed by many theists but is highly controversial among Christian theologians. Morris describes Property simplicity as the property of having no properties, and this area is more controversial still. In the medieval era, theologians and philosophers held to a view called \\"constituent ontology\\" whereby natures were actual constituents of things. Following Aquinas, an individual nature was more like a concrete object than an abstract object. Thus, one person's humanity was not, in this sense, the same as another person's humanity; each had his own individual human nature which was individuated by the matter (materia signata) out of which each man was composed. For entities which are immaterial such as angels, there is no matter to individuate their natures, so each one just is its nature. Each angel is therefore literally one of a kind, although, this claim proved controversial. Theologians holding the doctrine of property simplicity tend to distinguish various modes of the simple being of God by negating any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it. Thus, in quantitative or spatial terms, God is simple as opposed to being made up of pieces, present in entirety everywhere, if in fact present anywhere. In terms of essences, God is simple as opposed to being made up of form and matter, or body and soul, or mind and act, and so on. If distinctions are made when speaking of God's attributes, they are distinctions of the \\"modes\\" of God's being, rather than real or essential divisions. And so, in terms of subjects and accidents, as in the phrase \\"goodness of God\\", divine simplicity allows that there is a conceptual distinction between the person of God and the personal attribute of goodness, but the doctrine disallows that God's identity or \\"character\\" is dependent upon goodness, and at the same time the doctrine dictates that it is impossible to consider the goodness in which God participates separately from the goodness which God is. Furthermore, according to some [Kant, The Critique of Pure Reason?], as creatures our concepts are all drawn from the creation (the assumption of empiricism); it follows from this and divine simplicity that God's attributes can only be spoken of by analogy, since it is not true of any created thing that its properties are identical to its being. Consequently, when Christian Scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity, when it says that God is good for example, it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech. God's essence is inexpressible; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to God who simply is goodness, because humanity is a complex being composed by God \\"in the image and likeness of God.\\" =Criticism= The doctrine has been criticized by many Christian theologians, including John S. Feinberg, Thomas Morris, William Lane Craig, and Alvin Plantinga, who in his essay Does God Have a Nature? calls it \\"a dark saying indeed.\\"Plantinga, Alvin. \\"Does God Have a Nature?\\" in Plantinga, Alvin, and James F. Sennett. 1998. The analytic theist: an Alvin Plantinga reader. Grand Rapids, Mich: W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., 228. Plantinga gives three arguments against divine simplicity. First, he argues our concepts can apply univocally to God, even if our language to describe God is limited, fragmentary, halting, and inchoate. He argues that when we have a concept of something like being a horse, we know what it is for something to be a horse. The concept applies to an object if that object is, in fact, a horse. If none of our concepts apply to God, then it is sheer confusion to say there is such a person as God, and yet God does not have properties such as wisdom, being the creator, and being almighty. In fact, God would not have any properties for which we have concepts. God would not even have properties such as existing, being self-identical, or even being the referent of the term 'God.' If God transcends human experience, then we cannot say something univocal about God, since such a claim presupposes that we know what it means to transcend human experience, and that it applies to God. The claim that God can only be described analogically is, as Plantinga describes, a double-edged sword. If we cannot use univocal language to describe God and argue against simplicity, we are equally handicapped when it comes to the arguments for divine simplicity. If we cannot rely on our usual modes of inference in reasoning about God, we cannot argue for the conclusion that God is not distinct from his properties. Plantinga concludes \\"This way of thinking begins in a pious and commendable concern for God's greatness and majesty and augustness, but it ends in agnosticism and in incoherence.\\" Plantinga also gives three criticisms of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity directly, stating that it is exceedingly hard to grasp or construe the doctrine, and it is difficult to see why anyone would be inclined to accept it. First, the Thomist doctrine of simplicity states that all abstract objects are identical with God's essence and hence God himself. Plantinga states that this seems to clash with the obvious fact that the property of being a horse is distinct from the property of being a turkey and both are distinct from God and his essence. Secondly, Plantinga argues, if one restricts the realm of abstract objects that are identical with God to only the properties that God exemplifies, the doctrine is still problematic. Metaphysical simplicity states that God has no accidental (i.e. contingent) properties. Yet, it clearly does seem that God has accidental properties such as having created Adam, and knowing that Adam sinned. Some of God's characteristics characterize him in every possible world and some do not. Plantinga also argues that the conflation of God's actuality with his potentiality inherits all the problems of the essence-accident complexity and is furthermore vexed in its own right. Just as it seems there are characteristics that God has but could have lacked, it also seems the case that there are characteristics that God lacks but could have had. No doubt God has not created all the persons he will create. If so, there is at least one individual essence such that God does not now have, but will have the characteristic of causing that essence to be instantiated. If so, God has potentiality with respect to that characteristic. Plantinga's third critique challenges the very heart of simplicity. Metaphysical simplicity claims that there is no divine composition, meaning that there is no complexity of properties in God and that he is identical with his nature and each of his properties. There are two difficulties with this view. First, if God is identical with each of his properties, then each of his properties is identical with each of his other properties, so God has only one property. This flies in the face of the idea that God has both power and mercifulness, neither of which is identical with the other. Secondly, if God is identical with his properties, then, since each of God's properties is a property, it follows that God is a property as well. In this case, God has just one property: himself. The problem is that properties do not in and of themselves cause anything. No property could have created the world, and no property could know anything at all. If God is a property, then he isn't a person but a mere abstract object, having no power, life, love, or even awareness. Craig calls property simplicity \\"philosophically and theologically unacceptable.\\" He also states that divine simplicity is open to powerful objections. On the doctrine of divine simplicity, God is absolutely similar in all possible worlds. Since the statement \\"God knows x\\" is equivalent to \\"x is true,\\" it becomes inexplicable why those worlds vary if in every one God knows, loves, and wills the same things. Morris states that it is an idea whose implications are difficult to defend and whose advantages can be had in other ways. It is also an idea whose motivation, under close scrutiny, is not so convincing. John S. Feinberg concludes: \\"These philosophical problems plus the biblical considerations raised earlier lead me to conclude that simplicity is not one of the divine attributes. This doesn't mean that God has physical parts, but that the implications of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity are too problematic to maintain the doctrine.\\" In Islamic thought Rigorous views of divine simplicity were championed by the Mu'tazili, which resulted in a radically apophatic theology. By postulating a distinction between Existence and Essence for all created beings, which was perceived to be uniquely absent in God, Al-Farabi established another model of divine simplicity. Ibn SinƒÅ supported and elaborated this position, Al-Ghazali contested this identification of Divine essence and existence, but still saw all Divine attributes and acts as enveloped in and indistinct from the Divine Essence, this latter view of divine simplicity was shared with some of the most trenchant critics of the Muslim philosophical writers, like Ibn Taymiyyah.

Contacts under the vehicle touch the floor while a pole-mounted contact shoe touches the ceiling, forming a complete circuit. * A newer method, the Floor Pick-Up (FPU) system, uses alternating strips of metal across the floor separated by insulating spacers, and no ceiling grid. The alternating strips carry the supply current, and the cars are large enough so that the vehicle body can always cover at least two strips at any one time. An array of brushes under each car make random contact with whatever strip is below, and the voltage polarity on each contact is sorted out to always provide a correct and complete circuit to operate the vehicle. * The bumper cars on the Quantum-class cruise ships run on electric batteries. This avoids the conductive floor/ceiling of the traditional bumper cars setup, as the SeaPlex venue is to be readily convertible from a bumper cars ride to a multipurpose gym (basketball court). The disadvantage is that these ships' bumper cars take several hours to recharge their batteries. A ride in a bumper car, short video clip The metal floor is usually set up as a rectangular or oval track, and graphite is sprinkled on the floor to decrease friction. A rubber bumper surrounds each vehicle, and drivers either ram or dodge each other as they travel. The controls are usually an accelerator and a steering wheel. The cars can be made to go backwards by turning the steering wheel far enough in either direction, necessary in the frequent pile-ups that occur. Although the idea of the ride is to bump other cars, safety-conscious (or at least litigation-conscious) owners sometimes put up signs reading \\"This way around\\" and \\"No (head on) bumping.\\" Depending on the level of enforcement by operators, these rules are often ignored by bumper car riders, especially younger children and teenagers. During their heyday, from the late 1920s to 1950s, two major US bumper cars brands were Dodgem by Max and Harold Stoehrer and the Lusse Brothers' Auto-Skooter by Joseph and Robert 'Ray' Lusse. Includes many details about Dodgem as well. Lusse Brothers built the first fiberglass body in 1959, in part due to the survival of Chevrolet Corvette bodies over the previous six years. After getting permission from Chevrolet, then subsequently buying the actual Corvette chevrons from local Philadelphia dealers, those were attached to the nose of their product for 1959. In the mid-1960s, Disneyland introduced hovercraft-based bumper cars called Flying Saucers, which worked on the same principle as an air hockey game; however, the ride was a mechanical failure and closed after a few years. The current largest operating bumper car floor in the United States is located at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois, and is called the Rue Le Dodge (Rue Le Morgue during Fright Fest in the fall). The ride is by or a total of . A replica of the ride was built at California's Great America in Santa Clara; in 2005, however, a concrete island was added to the middle of the floor to promote one-way traffic, reducing the floor area. Six Flags Great Adventure's Autobahn is the largest bumper car floor, but it has not operated since 2008.

He was the last prime minister to hold office while a member of the House of Lords, before disclaiming his peerage and taking up a seat in the House of Commons for the remainder of his premiership. His reputation, however, rests more on his two spells as Britain's foreign minister than on his brief premiership. The eldest child of Charles Douglas-Home, Lord Dunglass, he was born in 1903 at 28 South Street in Mayfair, London, which his family leased from the politician and stockbroker, Sir Cuthbert Quilter, and was the future home of Barbara Cartland, the author and socialite. Douglas-Home was educated at Ludgrove School, Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. A talented cricketer, he played first-class cricket at club and county level; he began serving in the Territorial Army from 1924. Douglas-Home (under the courtesy title Lord Dunglass) entered Parliament in 1931 and served as Neville Chamberlain's parliamentary aide, although his diagnosis in 1940 with spinal tuberculosis would immobilise him for two years. Having recovered enough to resume his political career, Douglas-Home lost his seat to Labour at the 1945 general election. He regained it in 1950, but left the Commons the following year when, on the death of his father, he entered the Lords as the 14th Earl of Home. Under the next Conservative government, Home was appointed to increasingly senior posts, such as Leader of the House of Lords and Foreign Secretary. In the latter post (1960‚Äì63) he supported United States resolve in the Cuban Missile Crisis and was the UK signatory of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in August 1963. In October 1963, Harold Macmillan resigned as Prime Minister and Douglas-Home was chosen to succeed him. By the 1960s, it was unacceptable for a prime minister to sit in the House of Lords, so Home disclaimed his hereditary peerage and successfully stood for election to Parliament as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The manner of his appointment was controversial, and two Macmillan Cabinet ministers refused to stay in office under him. Criticised by the Labour Party as an out-of-touch aristocrat, he came over stiffly in television interviews, by contrast with Labour leader Harold Wilson. As Prime Minister, Douglas-Home's demeanour and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his Chancellor, Reginald Maudling, free rein to handle financial affairs. He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy and his Foreign Secretary, Rab Butler, was not especially energetic, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. The Conservative Party, having governed for nearly twelve years, lost their standing after the scandalous Profumo affair under Macmillan and, by Douglas-Home's premiership, seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat; his premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of resale price maintenance in 1964. Narrowly defeated in the 1964 UK general election, Douglas-Home resigned the party leadership in July 1965, having instituted a new and less secretive method for electing the leader. He later served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Edward Heath at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1970‚Äì1974), an expanded version of his former secretaryship. After the first of the twin Conservative defeats of 1974, he stood down at the second, the October 1974 election, and returned to the Lords as a life peer titled Baron Home of the Hirsel. He gradually retired from front-line politics and died in 1995, aged 92. Life and career =Early years= Douglas-Home was born in Mayfair, London, the first of seven children of Lord Dunglass (the eldest son of the 12th Earl of Home) and his wife, the Lady Lilian Lambton (daughter of the 4th Earl of Durham). The boy's first name was customarily abbreviated to \\"Alec\\". Among the couple's younger children was the playwright William Douglas-Home. In 1918 the 12th Earl of Home died, Dunglass succeeded him in the earldom, and the courtesy title passed to Alec Douglas-Home, who was styled Lord Dunglass until 1951.; and The young Lord Dunglass was educated at Ludgrove School, followed by Eton College. At Eton his contemporaries included Cyril Connolly, who later described him as: After Eton, Dunglass went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a third-class honours BA degree in Modern History in 1925. As a member of the Eton XI, 1921 Dunglass was a talented sportsman. In addition to representing Eton at fives, he was a capable cricketer at school, club and county level, and was unique among British prime ministers in having played first-class cricket. Coached by George Hirst, he became in Wisden's phrase \\"a useful member of the Eton XI\\" that included Percy Lawrie and Gubby Allen. Wisden observed, \\"In the rain-affected Eton‚ÄìHarrow match of 1922 he scored 66, despite being hindered by a saturated outfield, and then took 4 for 37 with his medium-paced out-swingers\\". At first-class level he represented the Oxford University Cricket Club, Middlesex County Cricket Club and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Between 1924 and 1927 he played ten first-class matches, scoring 147 runs at an average of 16.33 with a best score of 37 not out. As a bowler he took 12 wickets at an average of 30.25 with a best of 3 for 43. Three of his first-class games were internationals against Argentina on the MCC \\"representative\\" tour of South America in 1926‚Äì27. Dunglass began serving in the Territorial Army when in 1924 he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Lanarkshire Yeomanry, then was promoted captain in 1928, and major in 1933. =Member of Parliament (1931‚Äì37)= The courtesy title Lord Dunglass did not carry with it membership of the House of Lords, and Dunglass was eligible to seek election to the House of Commons. Unlike many aristocratic families, the Douglas-Homes had little history of political service. Uniquely in the family the 11th earl, Dunglass's great-grandfather, had held government office, as Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office in Wellington's 1828‚Äì30 government. Dunglass's father stood, reluctantly and unsuccessfully, for Parliament before succeeding to the earldom. Dunglass had shown little interest in politics while at Eton or Oxford. He had not joined the Oxford Union as budding politicians usually did. However, as heir to the family estates he was doubtful about the prospect of life as a country gentleman: \\"I was always rather discontented with this role and felt it wasn't going to be enough.\\" His biographer David Dutton believes that Dunglass became interested in politics because of the widespread unemployment and poverty in the Scottish lowlands where his family lived. Later in his career, when he had become Prime Minister, Dunglass (by then Sir Alec Douglas-Home) wrote in a memorandum: \\"I went into politics because I felt that it was a form of public service and that as nearly a generation of politicians had been cut down in the first war those who had anything to give in the way of leadership ought to do so.\\" His political thinking was influenced by that of Noel Skelton, a member of the Unionist party (as the Conservatives were called in Scotland between 1912 and 1965). Skelton advocated \\"a property-owning democracy\\", based on share-options for workers and industrial democracy. Dunglass was not persuaded by the socialist ideal of public ownership. He shared Skelton's view that \\"what everybody owns nobody owns\\". With Skelton's support Dunglass secured the Unionist candidacy at Coatbridge for the 1929 general election. It was not a seat that the Unionists expected to win, and he lost to his Labour opponent with 9,210 votes to Labour's 16,879. It was, however, valuable experience for Dunglass, who was of a gentle and uncombative disposition and not a natural orator; he began to learn how to deal with hostile audiences and get his message across. When a coalition \\"National Government\\" was formed in 1931 to deal with a financial crisis, Dunglass was adopted as the pro-coalition Unionist candidate for Lanark. The electorate of the area was mixed, and the constituency was not seen as a safe seat for any party; at the 1929 election Labour had captured it from the Unionists. With the backing of the pro- coalition Liberal party, which supported him rather than fielding its own candidate, Dunglass easily beat the Labour candidate. Membership of the new House of Commons was overwhelmingly made up of pro-coalition MPs, and there was therefore a large number of eligible members for the government posts to be filled. In Dutton's phrase, \\"it would have been easy for Dunglass to have languished indefinitely in backbench obscurity\\". However, Skelton, appointed as Under-Secretary at the Scottish Office, offered Dunglass the unpaid post of unofficial parliamentary aide. This was doubly advantageous to Dunglass. Any MP appointed as official Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to a government minister was privy to the inner workings of government but was expected to maintain a discreet silence in the House of Commons. Dunglass achieved the first without having to observe the second. He made his maiden speech in February 1932 on the subject of economic policy, advocating a cautiously protectionist approach to cheap imports. He countered Labour's objection that this would raise the cost of living, arguing that a tariff \\"stimulates employment and gives work [and] increases the purchasing power of the people by substituting wages for unemployment benefit\\". During four years as Skelton's aide Dunglass was part of a team working on a wide range of issues, from medical services in rural Scotland to land settlements, fisheries, education, and industry. Dunglass was appointed official PPS to Anthony Muirhead, junior minister at the Ministry of Labour, in 1935, and less than a year later became PPS to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain. In 1936 Dunglass married Elizabeth Alington; her father, Cyril Alington, had been Dunglass's headmaster at Eton, and was from 1933 Dean of Durham. The service was at Durham Cathedral, conducted by Alington together with William Temple, Archbishop of York and Hensley Henson, Bishop of Durham. In addition to the large number of aristocratic guests, the household and estate staffs of the Douglas-Home properties at Douglas Castle and the Hirsel were invited. There were four children of the marriage: Caroline, Meriel, Diana and David. The last was Dunglass's heir, inheriting the earldom of Home in 1995. =Chamberlain and war= By the time of Dunglass's appointment Chamberlain was generally seen as the heir to the premiership. In 1937 the incumbent, Stanley Baldwin, retired, and Chamberlain succeeded him. He then successfully obtained Dunglass as his PPS, a role described by the biographer D. R. Thorpe as \\"the right-hand man ... the eyes and ears of Neville Chamberlain\\", and by Dutton as \\"liaison officer with the Parliamentary party, transmitting and receiving information and [keeping] his master informed of the mood on the government's back benches\\". This was particularly important for Chamberlain, who was often seen as distant and aloof; Douglas Hurd wrote that he \\"lacked the personal charm which makes competent administration palatable to wayward colleagues ‚Äì a gift which his parliamentary private secretary possessed in abundance\\". Dunglass admired Chamberlain, despite his daunting personality: \\"I liked him, and I think he liked me. But if one went in at the end of the day for a chat or a gossip, he would be inclined to ask 'What do you want?' He was a very difficult man to get to know.\\"Quoted in As Chamberlain's aide Dunglass witnessed at first-hand the Prime Minister's attempts to prevent a second world war through appeasement of Adolf Hitler's Germany. When Chamberlain had his final meeting with Hitler at Munich in September 1938, Dunglass accompanied him. Having gained a short-lived extension of peace by acceding to Hitler's territorial demands at the expense of Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain was welcomed back to London by cheering crowds. Ignoring Dunglass's urging he made an uncharacteristically grandiloquent speech, claiming to have brought back \\"Peace with Honour\\" and promising \\"peace for our time\\". These words were to haunt him when Hitler's continued aggression made war unavoidable less than a year later. Chamberlain remained Prime Minister from the outbreak of war in September 1939 until May 1940, when, in Dunglass's words, \\"he could no longer command support of a majority in the Conservative party\\". After a vote in the Commons, in which the government's majority fell from more than 200 to 81, Chamberlain made way for Winston Churchill. He accepted the non-departmental post of Lord President of the Council in the new coalition government; Dunglass remained as his PPS, having earlier declined the offer of a ministerial post as Under-secretary at the Scottish Office. Although Chamberlain's reputation never recovered from Munich, and his supporters such as R A Butler suffered throughout their later careers from the \\"appeasement\\" tag, Dunglass largely escaped blame. Nevertheless, Dunglass firmly maintained all his life that the Munich agreement had been vital to the survival of Britain and the defeat of Nazi Germany by giving the UK an extra year to prepare for a war that it could not have contested in 1938. Within months of his leaving the premiership Chamberlain's health began to fail; he resigned from the cabinet, and died after a short illness in November 1940. =Health crisis, and recovery= Dunglass had volunteered for active military service, seeking to rejoin the Lanarkshire Yeomanry shortly after Chamberlain left Downing Street. The consequent medical examination revealed that Dunglass had a hole in his spine surrounded by tuberculosis in the bone. Without surgery he would have been unable to walk within a matter of months. An innovative and hazardous operation was performed in September 1940, lasting six hours, in which the diseased bone in the spine was scraped away and replaced with healthy bone from the patient's shin. For all of Dunglass's humour and patience, the following two years were a grave trial. He was encased in plaster and kept flat on his back for most of that period. Although buoyed up by the sensitive support of his wife and family, as he later confessed, \\"I often felt that I would be better dead.\\" Towards the end of 1942 he was released from his plaster jacket and fitted with a spinal brace, and in early 1943 he was mobile for the first time since the operation. During his incapacity he read voraciously; among the works he studied were Das Kapital, and works by Engels and Lenin, biographies of nineteenth and twentieth century politicians, and novels by authors from Dostoyevsky to Koestler. =Return to Commons, first ministerial post= In July 1943 Dunglass attended the House of Commons for the first time since 1940, and began to make a reputation as a backbench member, particularly for his expertise in the field of foreign affairs. He foresaw a post-imperial future for Britain and emphasised the need for strong European ties after the war. In 1944, with the war now turning in the Allies' favour, Dunglass spoke eloquently about the importance of resisting the Soviet Union's ambition to dominate eastern Europe. His boldness in publicly urging Churchill not to give in to Joseph Stalin was widely remarked upon; many, including Churchill himself, observed that some of those once associated with appeasement were determined that it should not be repeated in the face of Russian aggression. Labour left the wartime coalition in May 1945 and Churchill formed a caretaker Conservative government, pending a general election in July. Dunglass was appointed to his first ministerial post: Anthony Eden remained in charge of the Foreign Office, and Dunglass was appointed as one of his two Under-secretaries of State. =Postwar period (1945‚Äì50)= At the July 1945 general election Dunglass lost his Parliamentary seat in the landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed a director of the Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951. In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour prime minister, called a general election. Dunglass was invited to stand once again as Unionist candidate for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele's association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability. Dunglass regained the seat with one of the smallest majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5. =Succession to earldom= The Hirsel, the Douglas-Home family's principal residence In July 1951 the 13th earl died. Dunglass succeeded him, inheriting the title of Earl of Home together with the extensive family estates, including The Hirsel, the Douglas-Homes' principal residence. The new Lord Home took his seat in the Lords; a by-election was called to appoint a new MP for Lanark, but it was still pending when Attlee called another general election in October 1951. The Unionists held Lanark, and the national result gave the Conservatives under Churchill a small but working majority of 17. =Rise in Cabinet= Home was appointed to the new post of Minister of State at the Scottish Office, a middle-ranking position, senior to Under-secretary but junior to James Stuart, the Secretary of State, who was a member of the cabinet. Stuart, previously an influential chief whip, was a confidant of Churchill, and possibly the most powerful Scottish Secretary in any government. Thorpe writes that Home owed his appointment to Stuart's advocacy rather than to any great enthusiasm on the Prime Minister's part (Churchill referred to him as \\"Home sweet Home\\"). In addition to his ministerial position Home was appointed to membership of the Privy Council, an honour granted only selectively to ministers below cabinet rank. The royal cypher ‚Äì a problem for Home and the Scottish Office Throughout Churchill's second term as Prime Minister (1951‚Äì1955) Home remained at the Scottish Office, although both Eden at the Foreign Office and Lord Salisbury at the Commonwealth Relations Office invited him to join their ministerial teams. Among the Scottish matters with which he dealt were hydro-electric projects, hill farming, sea transport, road transport, forestry, and the welfare of crofters in the Highlands and the Western Isles. These matters went largely unreported in the British press, but the question of the royal cypher on Post Office pillar boxes became front-page news. Because Elizabeth I of England was never queen of Scotland, some nationalists maintained when Elizabeth II came to the British throne in 1952 that in Scotland she should be styled \\"Elizabeth I\\". Churchill said in the House of Commons that considering the \\"greatness and splendour of Scotland\\", and the contribution of the Scots to British and world history, \\"they ought to keep their silliest people in order\\". Home nevertheless arranged that in Scotland new pillar boxes were decorated with the royal crown instead of the full cypher. When Eden succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister in 1955, he promoted Home to the cabinet as Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. At the time of this appointment Home had not been to any of the countries within his ministerial remit, and he quickly arranged to visit Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. He had to deal with the sensitive subject of immigration from and between Commonwealth countries, where a delicate balance had to be struck between resistance in some quarters in Britain and Australia to non-white immigration on the one hand, and on the other the danger of sanctions in India and Pakistan against British commercial interests if discriminatory policies were pursued. In most respects, however, when Home took up the appointment it seemed to be a relatively uneventful period in the history of the Commonwealth. The upheaval of Indian independence in 1947 was well in the past, and the wave of decolonising of the 1960s was yet to come. However, it fell to Home to maintain Commonwealth unity during the Suez Crisis in 1956, described by Dutton as \\"the most divisive in its history to date\\". Australia, New Zealand and South Africa backed the Anglo- French invasion of Egypt to regain control of the Suez Canal. Canada, Ceylon, India and Pakistan all opposed it. There appeared to be a real danger that Ceylon, India and, particularly, Pakistan might leave the Commonwealth. Home was firm in his support of the invasion, but used his contacts with Jawaharlal Nehru, V. K. Krishna Menon, Nan Pandit and others to try to prevent the Commonwealth from breaking up. His relationship with Eden was supportive and relaxed; he felt able, as others did not, to warn Eden of unease about Suez both internationally and among some members of the cabinet. Eden dismissed the latter as the \\"weak sisters\\"; the most prominent was Rab Butler, whose perceived hesitancy over Suez on top of his support for appeasement of Hitler damaged his standing within the Conservative party. When the invasion was abandoned under pressure from the US in November 1956, Home worked with the dissenting members of the Commonwealth to build the organisation into what Douglas Hurd calls \\"a modern multiracial Commonwealth\\". =Macmillan's government= Eden resigned in January 1957. In 1955 he had been the obvious successor to Churchill, but this time there was no clear heir apparent. Leaders of the Conservative party were not elected by ballot of MPs or party members, but emerged after informal soundings within the party, known as \\"the customary processes of consultation\\". The chief whip, Edward Heath, canvassed the views of backbench Conservative MPs, and two senior Conservative peers, the Lord President of the Council, Lord Salisbury, and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir, saw members of the cabinet individually to ascertain their preferences. Only one cabinet colleague supported Butler; the rest, including Home, opted for Harold Macmillan. Churchill, whom the Queen consulted, did the same. Macmillan was appointed Prime Minister on 10 January 1957. In the new administration Home remained at the Commonwealth Relations Office. Much of his time was spent on matters relating to Africa, where the futures of Bechuanaland and the Central African Federation needed to be agreed. Among other matters in which he was involved were the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, assisted emigration from Britain to Australia, and relations with Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus. The last unexpectedly led to an enhanced cabinet role for Home. Makarios, leader of the militant anti-British and pro-Greek movement, was detained in exile in the Seychelles. Macmillan, with the agreement of Home and most of the cabinet, decided that this imprisonment was doing more harm than good to Britain's position in Cyprus, and ordered Makarios's release. Lord Salisbury strongly dissented from the decision and resigned from the cabinet in March 1957. Macmillan added Salisbury's responsibilities to Home's existing duties, making him Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords. The first of these posts was largely honorific, but the leadership of the Lords put Home in charge of getting the government's business through the upper house, and brought him nearer to the centre of power. In Hurd's phrase, \\"By the imperceptible process characteristic of British politics he found himself month by month, without any particular manoeuvre on his part, becoming an indispensable figure in the government.\\" Iain Macleod, who had a difficult relationship with Home Home was generally warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, and there were few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959‚Äì61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation. Macleod wished to push ahead with majority rule and independence; Home believed in a more gradual approach to independence, accommodating both white minority and black majority opinions and interests. Macleod disagreed with those who warned that precipitate independence would lead the newly independent nations into \\"trouble, strife, poverty, dictatorship\\" and other evils. His reply was, \\"Would you want the Romans to have stayed on in Britain?\\" He threatened to resign unless he was allowed to release the leading Nyasaland activist Hastings Banda from prison, a move that Home and others thought unwise and liable to provoke distrust of Britain among the white minority in the federation. Macleod had his way, but by that time Home was no longer at the Commonwealth Relations Office. =Foreign Secretary (1960‚Äì63)= In 1960 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, insisted on retiring. Macmillan agreed with Heathcoat- Amory that the best successor at the Treasury would be the current Foreign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd. In terms of ability and experience the obvious candidate to take over from Lloyd at the Foreign Office was Home, but by 1960 there was an expectation that the Foreign Secretary would be a member of the House of Commons. The post had not been held by a peer since Lord Halifax in 1938‚Äì40; Eden had wished to appoint Salisbury in 1955, but concluded that it would be unacceptable to the Commons. Edward Heath, Home's deputy at the Foreign Office. They later served in each other's cabinets. After discussions with Lloyd and senior civil servants, Macmillan took the unprecedented step of appointing two Foreign Office cabinet ministers: Home, as Foreign Secretary, in the Lords, and Edward Heath, as Lord Privy Seal and deputy Foreign Secretary, in the Commons. With British application for admission to the European Economic Community (EEC) pending, Heath was given particular responsibility for the EEC negotiations as well as for speaking in the Commons on foreign affairs in general. The opposition Labour party protested at Home's appointment; its leader, Hugh Gaitskell, said that it was \\"constitutionally objectionable\\" for a peer to be in charge of the Foreign Office. Macmillan responded that an accident of birth should not be allowed to deny him the services of \\"the best man for the job ‚Äì the man I want at my side\\". Hurd comments, \\"Like all such artificial commotions it died down after a time (and indeed was not renewed with any strength nineteen years later when Margaret Thatcher appointed another peer, Lord Carrington, to the same post).\\" The Home‚ÄìHeath partnership worked well. Despite their different backgrounds and ages ‚Äì Home an Edwardian aristocrat and Heath a lower-middle class meritocrat raised in the inter-war years ‚Äì the two men respected and liked one another. Home supported Macmillan's ambition to get Britain into the EEC, and was happy to leave the negotiations in Heath's hands. Home's attention was mainly concentrated on the Cold War, where his forcefully expressed anti-communist beliefs were tempered by a pragmatic approach to dealing with the Soviet Union. His first major problem in this sphere was in 1961 when on the orders of the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall was erected to stop East Germans escaping to West Germany via West Berlin. Home wrote to his American counterpart, Dean Rusk, \\"The prevention of East Berliners getting into West Berlin has never been a casus belli for us. We are concerned with Western access to Berlin and that is what we must maintain.\\" The governments of West Germany, Britain and the US quickly reached agreement on their joint negotiating position; it remained to persuade President de Gaulle of France to align himself with the allies. During their discussions Macmillan commented that de Gaulle showed \\"all the rigidity of a poker without its occasional warmth\\". An agreement was reached, and the allies tacitly recognised that the wall was going to remain in place. The Soviets for their part did not seek to cut off allied access to West Berlin through East German territory. The following year the Cuban Missile Crisis threatened to turn the Cold War into a nuclear one. Soviet nuclear missiles were brought to Cuba, provocatively close to the US. The American president, John F Kennedy, insisted that they must be removed, and many thought that the world was on the brink of catastrophe with nuclear exchanges between the two super-powers. Despite a public image of unflappable calm, Macmillan was by nature nervous and highly strung. During the missile crisis, Home, whose calm was genuine and innate, strengthened the Prime Minister's resolve, and encouraged him to back up Kennedy's defiance of Soviet threats of nuclear attack. The Lord Chancellor (Lord Dilhorne), the Attorney General (Sir John Hobson) and the Solicitor General, (Sir Peter Rawlinson) privately gave Home their opinion that the American blockade of Cuba was a breach of international law, but he continued to advocate a policy of strong support for Kennedy. When Khrushchev backed down and removed the Soviet missiles from Cuba, Home commented: The principal landmark of Home's term as Foreign Secretary was also in the sphere of east‚Äìwest relations: the negotiation and signature of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. He got on well with his American and Soviet counterparts, Rusk and Andrei Gromyko. The latter wrote that whenever he met Home there were \\"no sudden, still less brilliant, breakthroughs\\" but \\"each meeting left a civilised impression that made the next meeting easier\\". Gromyko concluded that Home added sharpness to British foreign policy. Gromyko, Home and Rusk signed the treaty in Moscow on 5 August 1963. After the fear provoked internationally by the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water was widely welcomed as a step towards ending the cold war. For the British government the good news from Moscow was doubly welcome for drawing attention away from the Profumo affair, a sexual scandal involving a senior minister, which had left Macmillan's administration looking vulnerable. =Successor to Macmillan= Lord Hailsham, Macmillan's original preference as successor In October 1963, just before the Conservative party's annual conference, Macmillan was taken ill with a prostatic obstruction. The condition was at first thought more serious than it turned out to be, and he announced that he would resign as Prime Minister as soon as a successor was appointed. Three senior politicians were considered likely successors, 'Rab' Butler (Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State), Reginald Maudling (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Lord Hailsham (Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords). The Times summed up their support: In the same article, Home was mentioned in passing as \\"a fourth hypothetical candidate\\" on whom the party could compromise if necessary. It was assumed in the Times article, and by other commentators, that if Hailsham (or Home) was a candidate he would have to renounce his peerage. This had been made possible for the first time by recent legislation. The last British prime minister to sit in the House of Lords was the Marquess of Salisbury, in 1902. By 1923, having to choose between Baldwin and Lord Curzon, George V decided that \\"the requirements of the present times\\" obliged him to appoint a prime minister from the Commons. His private secretary recorded that the King \\"believed he would not be fulfilling his trust were he now to make his selection of Prime Minister from the House of Lords\\".Lord Stamfordham, quoted in Similarly, after the resignation of Neville Chamberlain in 1940 there were two likely successors, Churchill and Halifax, but the latter ruled himself out for the premiership on the grounds that his membership of the House of Lords disqualified him. In 1963, therefore, it was well established that the prime minister should be a member of the House of Commons. On 10 October Hailsham announced his intention to renounce his viscountcy. The \\"customary processes\\" once again took place. The usual privacy of the consultations was made impossible because they took place during the party conference, and the potential successors made their bids very publicly. Butler had the advantage of giving the party leader's keynote address to the conference in Macmillan's absence, but was widely thought to have wasted the opportunity by delivering an uninspiring speech. Hailsham put off many potential backers by his extrovert, and some thought vulgar, campaigning. Maudling, like Butler, made a speech that failed to impress the conference. Senior Conservative figures such as Lord Woolton and Selwyn Lloyd urged Home to make himself available for consideration. Having ruled himself out of the race when the news of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by changing his mind. Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He let it be known that if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from David Ormsby- Gore, 5th Baron Harlech, the British ambassador to the United States, that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters. Butler, by contrast, was seen as on the liberal wing of the Conservatives, and his election as leader might split the party. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, conducted a poll of cabinet members, and reported to Macmillan that taking account of first and second preferences there were ten votes for Home, four for Maudling, three for Butler and two for Hailsham. The appointment of a prime minister remained part of the royal prerogative, on which the monarch had no constitutional duty to consult an outgoing prime minister. Nevertheless, Macmillan advised the Queen that he considered Home the right choice. Little of this was known beyond the senior ranks of the party and the royal secretariat. On 18 October The Times ran the headline, \\"The Queen May Send for Mr. Butler Today\\". The Daily Telegraph and The Financial Times also predicted that Butler was about to be appointed. The Queen sent for Home the same day. Aware of the divisions within the governing party, she did not appoint him Prime Minister, but invited him to see whether he was able to form a government. Home's cabinet colleagues Enoch Powell and Iain Macleod, who disapproved of his candidacy, made a last-minute effort to prevent him from taking office by trying to persuade Butler and the other candidates not to take posts in a Home cabinet. Butler, however, believed it to be his duty to serve in the cabinet; he refused to have any part in the conspiracy, and accepted the post of Foreign Secretary. The other candidates followed Butler's lead and only Powell and Macleod held out and refused office under Home. Macleod commented, \\"One does not expect to have many people with one in the last ditch.\\" On 19 October Home was able to return to Buckingham Palace to kiss hands as Prime Minister. The press was not only wrong-footed by the appointment, but generally highly critical. The pro-Labour Daily Mirror said on its front page: The Times, generally pro-Conservative, had backed Butler, and called it \\"prodigal\\" of the party to pass over his many talents. The paper praised Home as \\"an outstandingly successful Foreign Secretary\\", but doubted his grasp of domestic affairs, his modernising instincts and his suitability \\"to carry the Conservative Party through a fierce and probably dirty campaign\\" at the general election due within a year. The Guardian, liberal in its political outlook, remarked that Home \\"does not look like the man to impart force and purpose to his Cabinet and the country\\" and suggested that he seemed too frail politically to be even a stop-gap. The Observer, another liberal-minded paper, said, \\"The overwhelming ‚Äì and damaging ‚Äì impression left by the events of the last two weeks is that the Tories have been forced to settle for a second-best. ... The calmness and steadiness which made him a good Foreign Secretary, particularly at times of crisis like Berlin and Cuba, may also be a liability.\\" In January 1964 Macleod, now editor of The Spectator, used the pretext of a review of a book by Randolph Churchill to publicise his own different and very detailed version of the leadership election. He described the \\"soundings\\" of five Tory leaders, four of whom including Home and Macmillan had attended Eton, as a conspiracy by an Etonian \\"magic circle\\". The article received wide publicity; Anthony Howard later declared himself \\"deeply affronted ... and never more affronted than when Alec Douglas-Home became leader of the Conservative Party\\". =Prime Minister (1963‚Äì64)= On 23 October 1963, four days after becoming Prime Minister, Home disclaimed his earldom and associated lesser peerages, under the Peerage Act 1963. Having been made a knight of the Order of the Thistle in 1962, he was known after stepping down from the Lords as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The safe Unionist seat of Kinross and West Perthshire was vacant following the sudden death of Gilmour Leburn and the candidate initially adopted, George Younger, agreed to stand aside. Douglas-Home was thus adopted as his party's candidate. Parliament was due to meet on 24 October after the summer recess, but its return was postponed until 12 November pending the by-election. For twenty days Douglas-Home was Prime Minister while a member of neither house of Parliament, a situation without modern precedent. He won the 7 November by- election with a majority of 9,328; the Liberal candidate was in second place and Labour in third. Harold Wilson, an opponent of Douglas-Home The Parliamentary leader of the opposition Labour party, Harold Wilson, attacked the new prime minister as \\"an elegant anachronism\\". He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home's background knew of the problems of ordinary families. In particular, Wilson demanded to know how \\"a scion of an effete establishment\\" could lead the technological revolution that Wilson held to be necessary: \\"This is the counter-revolution ... After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!\\" Douglas-Home pooh-poohed this as inverted snobbery, and observed, \\"I suppose Mr Wilson, when you come to think of it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson.\\" He called Wilson \\"this slick salesman of synthetic science\\" and the Labour party \\"the only relic of class consciousness in the country\\". The opposition retreated, with a statement in the press that \\"The Labour Party is not interested in the fact that the new prime minister inherited a fourteenth Earldom ‚Äì he cannot help his antecedents any more than the rest of us.\\" Douglas-Home inherited from Macmillan a government widely perceived as in decline; Hurd wrote that it was \\"becalmed in a sea of satire and scandal.\\" Douglas-Home was the target of satirists on BBC television and in Private Eye magazine. Unlike Wilson, he was not at ease on television, and came across as less spontaneous than his opponent. In international affairs the most dramatic event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963. Douglas-Home broadcast a tribute on television. He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement on the question of British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government. In Britain there was economic prosperity; exports \\"zoomed\\", according to The Times, and the economy was growing at an annual rate of four per cent. Douglas-Home made no pretence to economic expertise; he commented that his problems were of two sorts: \\"The political ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible.\\" On another occasion he said, \\"When I have to read economic documents I have to have a box of matches and start moving them into position to simplify and illustrate the points to myself.\\" He left Maudling in charge at the Treasury, and promoted Heath to a new business and economic portfolio. The latter took the lead in the one substantial piece of domestic legislation of Douglas- Home's premiership, the abolition of resale price maintenance. The Resale Prices Bill was introduced to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, to the detriment of competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office. A plot to kidnap Douglas-Home in April 1964 was foiled by the Prime Minister himself. Two left-wing students from the University of Aberdeen followed him to the house of John and Priscilla Buchan, where he was staying. He was alone at the time and answered the door, where the students told him that they planned to kidnap him. He responded, \\"I suppose you realise if you do, the Conservatives will win the election by 200 or 300.\\" He gave his intending abductors some beer, and they abandoned their plot. The term of the Parliament elected in 1959 was due to expire in October 1964. Parliament was dissolved on 25 September and after three weeks of campaigning the 1964 United Kingdom general election took place on 15 October. The Conservatives under Douglas-Home did much better than widely predicted, but Labour under Wilson won with a narrow majority. Labour won 317 seats, the Conservatives 304 and the Liberals 9. =In Opposition (1964‚Äì70)= As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell to rejoin the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general election Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home to hand over the leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor. Enoch Powell returned to the Conservative front bench in 1964 and later sought the party leadership. Determined that the party should abandon the \\"customary processes of consultation\\", which had caused such rancour when he was appointed in 1963, Douglas-Home set up an orderly process of secret balloting by Conservative MPs for the election of his immediate and future successors as party leader. In the interests of impartiality the ballot was organised by the 1922 Committee, the backbench Conservative MPs. Douglas-Home announced his resignation as Conservative leader on 22 July 1965. Three candidates stood in the 1965 Conservative Party leadership election: Heath, Maudling and Powell. Heath won with 150 votes (one of them cast by Douglas- Home) to 133 for Maudling and 15 for Powell. Douglas-Home accepted the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected this to be a short- lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self- governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on the right wing of the Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds. In 1966 Douglas-Home became president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was then the governing body of English and world cricket. The presidency had generally been a largely ceremonial position, but Douglas-Home became embroiled in two controversies, one of them with international implications. This was the so-called \\"D'Oliveira affair\\", in which the inclusion of a non-white player in the England team to tour South Africa led to the cancellation of the tour by the apartheid regime in Pretoria. In his account of the affair, the political journalist Peter Oborne criticises Douglas-Home for his vacillating attitude towards South African Prime Minister John Vorster with whom, says Oborne, \\"he was no more robust than Chamberlain had been with Hitler thirty years earlier\\". Douglas-Home's advice to the MCC committee not to press the South Africans for advance assurances on D'Oliveira's acceptability, and his optimistic assurances that all would be well, became a matter of much criticism from a group of MCC members led by the Rev David Sheppard. The second controversy was not one of race but of social class. Brian Close was dropped as England captain in favour of Colin Cowdrey. Close was dropped after using delaying tactics when captaining Yorkshire in a county match, but the move was widely seen as biased towards cricketers from the old amateur tradition, which had officially ended in 1963. Wilson's small majority after the 1964 general election had made the transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room for members of the next generation. Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats. Douglas-Home received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot- Watt University in 1966. =Foreign and Commonwealth secretary (1970‚Äì74)= Heath invited Douglas-Home to join the cabinet, taking charge of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. In earlier centuries it had not been exceptional for a former prime minister to serve in the cabinet of a successor, and even in the previous fifty years Arthur Balfour, Stanley Baldwin, Ramsay MacDonald and Neville Chamberlain had done so. As of 2019, Douglas-Home is the last former premier to have served under a successor., , , , , and Of Balfour's appointment to Asquith's cabinet in 1916, Lord Rosebery, who had been Prime Minister in 1894‚Äì95, said that having an ex-premier in the cabinet was \\"a fleeting and dangerous luxury\\". Thorpe writes that Heath's appointment of Douglas-Home \\"was not a luxury but an essential buttress to his administration\\". The Wilson administration had merged the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office in 1966 into the Commonwealth Office, which, two years later, was merged with the Foreign Office, to form the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Heath appointed Douglas-Home to head the department, with, once again, a second cabinet minister, this time Anthony Barber, principally responsible, as Heath had been in the 1960s, for negotiations on Britain's joining the EEC. This time, however, both ministers were in the Commons; Barber's cabinet post was officially Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Within weeks of the election Barber was moved from the FCO to the Treasury to take over as Chancellor from Iain Macleod, who died suddenly on 20 July. Though they had never enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague's stature, and felt his loss politically as well as personally. Some commentators have maintained that Macleod's death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber fatally undermined the economic success of the Heath government.; ; and Barber was replaced at the FCO by Geoffrey Rippon, who handled the day-to-day negotiations, under the direction of Heath. Douglas-Home, as before, concentrated on east‚Äìwest and Commonwealth matters. He was in agreement with Heath's policy on the EEC, and did much to persuade doubters on the right wing of the Conservative party of the desirability of Britain's entry. Hurd writes: Andrei Gromyko, Douglas- Home's Soviet counterpart In east‚Äìwest relations, Douglas-Home continued his policy of keeping the Soviet Union at bay. In September 1971, after receiving no satisfactory results from negotiations with Gromyko about the flagrant activities of the KGB in Britain, he expelled 105 Soviet diplomats for spying. In addition to the furore arising from this, the Soviets felt that the British government's approach to negotiations on d√©tente in Europe was over-cautious, even sceptical. Gromyko was nonetheless realistic enough to maintain a working relationship with the British government. Within days of the expulsions from London he and Douglas-Home met and discussed the Middle East and disarmament. In this sphere of foreign policy, Douglas-Home was widely judged a success. In negotiations on the future of Rhodesia Douglas-Home was less successful. He was instrumental in persuading the rebel leader, Ian Smith, to accept proposals for a transition to African majority rule. Douglas-Home set up an independent commission chaired by a senior British judge, Lord Pearce, to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion in Rhodesia. After extensive fieldwork throughout Rhodesia, the commission reported, \\"We are satisfied on our evidence that the proposals are acceptable to the great majority of Europeans. We are equally satisfied ... that the majority of Africans rejected the proposals. In our opinion the people of Rhodesia as a whole do not regard the proposals as acceptable as a basis for independence.\\" To Douglas-Home's disappointment there was no resolution, and Rhodesia remained a rebel regime long after he left office. =Retirement and death (1974‚Äì95)= Home, photographed by Allan Warren, in 1986 At the February 1974 general election the Heath government was narrowly defeated. Douglas-Home, then aged 70, stepped down at the second election of that year, called in October by the minority Labour government in the hope of winning a working majority. He returned to the House of Lords at the end of 1974 when he accepted a life peerage, becoming known as Baron Home of the Hirsel, of Coldstream in the County of Berwick. Between 1977 and 1989 Home was Governor of I Zingari, the nomadic cricket team. In retirement he published three books: The Way The Wind Blows (1976), described by Hurd as \\"a good-natured autobiography, with perhaps more anecdotes than insights\\", Border Reflections (1979), and his correspondence with his grandson Matthew Darby, Letters to a Grandson (1983). In the 1980s Home increasingly spent his time in Scotland, with his family. He was a keen fisherman and enjoyed shooting. Hurd writes that \\"there was no sudden moment when he abandoned politics\\", rather that \\"his interventions became fewer and fewer\\". His last speech in the House of Lords was in 1989, when he spoke against Hurd's proposals for prosecuting war criminals living in Britain: \\"After such a lapse of time justice might not be seen to be done. It would be dangerous to rely on memories of events that occurred so long ago. It was too late to reopen the issue.\\" His withdrawal from public affairs became more marked after the death of his wife in 1990, after 54 years of marriage. Home died at the Hirsel in October 1995 when he was 92, four months after the death of his parliamentary opponent Harold Wilson. These two former prime ministers have the distinction of being the only ones who were both born in and died in the 20th century. Home was buried in Lennel churchyard, Coldstream. Reputation Statue of Douglas-Home at The Hirsel by sculptor Professor Bill Scott, unveiled in 1998. Home's premiership was short and not conspicuous for radical innovation. Hurd remarks, \\"He was not capable of Macmillan's flights of imagination\\", but he was an effective practical politician. At the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Foreign Office he played an important role in helping to manage Britain's transition from imperial power to European partner. Both Thorpe and Hurd quote a memo that Macmillan wrote in 1963, intended to help the Queen choose his successor: Douglas Hurd, once Home's private secretary, and many years later his successor (after seven intermediate holders of the post) as Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, wrote this personal comment: \\"The three most courteous men I knew in politics were Lord Home, King Hussein of Jordan, and President Nelson Mandela. All three had ease of birth, in the sense that they never needed to worry about who they themselves were and so had more time to concern themselves with the feelings of others.\\" Although some in the Conservative party agreed with Wilson (and Jo Grimond, the Liberal leader) that the Conservatives would have won the 1964 election if Butler had been Prime Minister, The Times observed, \\"it should not be overlooked that in October 1963 Home took over a Government whose morale was shattered and whose standing in the opinion polls was abysmal. A year later Labour won the general election, with an overall majority of only four seats. That [Home] recovered so much ground in so short a time was in itself an achievement.\\" However, looking back across Home's career, The Times considered that his reputation rested not on his brief premiership, but on his two spells as Foreign Secretary: \\"He brought to the office ... his capacity for straight talking, for toughness towards the Soviet Union and for firmness (sometimes interpreted as a lack of sympathy) towards the countries of Africa and Asia. But he brought something else as well: an unusual degree of international respect.\\" Cabinet (1963‚Äì64) The Home cabinet, announced on 20 October 1963, was: * Lord Home [Sir Alec Douglas-Home from 23 October]: Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury * R A Butler: Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs * Quintin Hogg: Lord President of the Council and Minister for Science * Lord Dilhorne: Lord Chancellor * Reginald Maudling: Chancellor of the Exchequer * Henry Brooke: Secretary of State for the Home Department * Duncan Sandys: Secretary of State for the Colonies and Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations * Edward Heath: Secretary of State for Industry, Trade, and Regional Development and President of the Board of Trade * Peter Thorneycroft: Minister of Defence * Selwyn Lloyd: Lord Privy Seal * Lord Blakenham: Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster * Christopher Soames: Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food * Ernest Marples: Minister of Transport * John Boyd-Carpenter: Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster-General * Michael Noble: Secretary of State for Scotland * Sir Edward Boyle: Minister of Education * Joseph Godber: Minister of Labour * Sir Keith Joseph: Minister of Housing and Local Government and Minister for Welsh Affairs * Frederick Erroll: Minister of Power * Anthony Barber: Minister of Health * Geoffrey Rippon: Minister of Public Building and Works * W F Deedes: Minister without Portfolio * Lord Carrington: Minister without Portfolio, Leader of the House of Lords ;Changes * April 1964: Quintin Hogg became Secretary of State for Education and Science.

In a career spanning more than 30 years, Rennie appeared in more than 50 films and in several American television series. Biography =Early years= Eric Alexander Rennie was born in Idle near Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, the second son of a Scottish wool mill owner, James Rennie, and his English wife Amelia (n√©e Dobby). He had an elder brother William, younger brother Gordon and sister Edith. Rennie's family owned a wool business which had operated for over 150 years and were relatively well off. He was educated at the Leys School, Cambridge. He went to work at the family wool mill in Bradford, but did not enjoy it. He worked in a number of occupations, including a stint as a car salesman, and sweeping floors in his uncle's steel ropes factory. He eventually decided (at the time of his 26th birthday, in 1935) on a career as an actor. He retained his surname but adopted Michael as his professional name. He cited Ronald Colman as his role model. =Early British films= The 6' 4\\" tall Rennie attracted the interest of a casting director at Gaumont British who took him on as an extra. Rennie said this was a deliberate strategy so he could learn how films were made. Head of production Michael Balcon said Rennie was taken on \\"because he was good-looking and athletic. He knew nothing of acting, but was given a contract to play small parts and to work as stand-in for players such as Robert Young and John Loder.\\" Rennie's first screen acting was an uncredited bit part in the Alfred Hitchcock film Secret Agent (1936), standing in for Robert Young. Balcon says he saw Rennie act in a scene in East Meets West (1936) and fired him immediately afterwards. Balcon wrote \\"I had seen the rushes of that day's filming and had at once decided that Rennie was far too inexperienced to justify big screen parts.\\" The 1937 screen test, which exists in the British Film Institute (BFI) archives under the title \\"Marguerite Allan and Michael Rennie Screen Test\\", did not lead to a film career for either performer. Balcon says Rennie \\"took his setback well, left the studios, and went off to learn his job in repertory.\\" Rennie worked mostly in Yorkshire, eventually becoming a star with the York Repertory Company. Among his roles were as Professor Henry Higgins in Pygmalion. He also played other bit parts and minor unbilled roles in other films, including The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936), Conquest of the Air (1937), The Squeaker (1937), Gangway (1937), The Divorce of Lady X (1938), Bank Holiday (1938), This Man in Paris (1939) and The Briggs Family (1940). He later said he strove to perfect a \\"mid-Atlantic accent\\" that could easily be understood by American as well as British audiences which resulted in people thinking he was Canadian. =World War II= Shortly after the outbreak of war in Europe on 3 September 1939, Rennie began to receive offers for larger film roles, including This Man Is Dangerous (1940), Dangerous Moonlight (1941) and Pimpernel Smith (1941). Rennie auditioned again for Michael Balcon, now head of Ealing Studios, and was cast in Ships with Wings. While that film was being prepared, Rennie continued repertory work and accepted a one-line role in George Formby's Turned Out Nice Again. Balcon says Rennie \\"declared that he enjoyed it as he was playing a motor salesman, and this reminded him of the days when he tried to sell cars ‚Äì without securing a single buyer.\\" Rennie had his first big film role in the suspense drama Tower of Terror (1941). This starred Wilfrid Lawson in the lead role as a crazed Dutch lighthouse keeper in the German-occupied Netherlands, while the second-billed Rennie and third-billed Movita had the romantic leads. In a 1951 interview Rennie said this was his worst part. Michael Balcon also used him in The Big Blockade (1942). He was called a \\"rapidly rising newcomer\\". Another profile referred to him as an \\"athletic, Gable-ish young man.\\" =War service= Rennie enlisted in the RAF Volunteer Reserve on 27 May 1941. \\"There has been a pause in Rennie's film career\\", wrote Balcon in 1942. \\"But there will be parts awaiting him when the war is over\\". He was officially discharged on 4 August 1942, and then on the following day, he was commissioned \\"for the emergency\\" as pilot officer number 127347 on probation in the General Duties Branch of the RAFVR. On 5 February 1943, he was promoted to flying officer on probation. He resigned his commission on 1 May 1944 (not discharged on disability, as the studio publicity stated). Rennie had carried out his basic training near Torquay in Devon, after which he was sent to the United States for fighter pilot training under the Arnold Plan. In this programme, pilots for the RAF were trained by United States Army Air Forces instructors. One of his fellow students was RAF Sgt Jack Morton, who told an anecdote about when he and Rennie were in the same class: > At the end of our primary course we were posted to a Basic Flying School at > Cochran Field, Macon, Georgia. The class which completed the course at > Cochran Field was now split up, half were posted to Napier Field, Dothan, > Alabama, to train on single-engine planes, and the remainder were posted to > twin-engine schools. Like Cochran, Napier Field was a large permanent Air > Corps Base and most of us were quite content to stay on the camp when we had > time off. One of the cadets on our course had told us that he was a film > actor, but no one took him seriously. We had to admit that he was right > however when a film came to the camp cinema called Ships with Wings starring > Michael Rennie. =British film stardom: I'll Be Your Sweetheart and The Wicked Lady= With the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Rennie was given his first film break, when cast alongside Margaret Lockwood, then at the peak of her popularity, in the musical I'll Be Your Sweetheart (1945), directed by Val Guest for Gainsborough Studios. Rennie was billed below Lockwood and Vic Oliver, given an \\"introducing\\" credit, but his character was the actual protagonist of the film. The movie was not a large hit but Rennie received excellent notices, including a review from the US trade paper Variety who said his performance made the film \\"noteworthy\\" and that he was \\"likely Hollywood material... the best bet in the way of a new male star to have come out of a British studio in many years. Rennie not only has a lot on the ball as a straight lead, he knows the value of visual tricks. Femmes will go for him in a big way.\\" He followed this in another movie with Lockwood at Gainsborough, the sensual costume adventure The Wicked Lady (both 1945). Rennie was the fifth lead, beneath Lockwood, James Mason, Patricia Roc and Griffith Jones. but it was a good part (the one true love of Lockwood's character) and an excellent project to be associated with ‚Äì the year's biggest box-office hit, subsequently being listed ninth on a list of top ten highest-grossing British films of all time. Rennie's prestige was also raised when he was given a single prominent scene as a commander of Roman centurions in Gabriel Pascal's production of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra (also 1945), starring Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains. The film's expense caused it to lose a large amount of money, despite it being highly successful at the box office, particularly in the U.S. Rennie was now established as a leading actor. One report called him \\"the bobbysoxers' dark idol... Gainsborough's 1945 discovery.\\" He was mobbed by female fans on a personal appearance tour. Gainsborough teamed him with one of their biggest female stars Phyllis Calvert in the melodrama The Root of All Evil (1947). In July 1946 it was announced Rennie had signed a five-year contract with Maurice Ostrer's new company, Premiere Productions, worth ¬£300,000 ‚Äì making him the highest paid film star in Britain. =Maurice Ostrer= Rennie's first film under the new contract was White Cradle Inn (1947), shot in Switzerland with Madeleine Carroll. Rennie had been \\"loaned out\\" to another company to make it but then he made his first for Ostrer at Premiere, The Idol of Paris (1948). The film did so badly that Ostrer left the film industry. Rennie made films for independent producers and his career momentum began to fade: Uneasy Terms (1949); Golden Madonna (1949) (again with Calvert); and two comedies for Val Guest: Miss Pilgrim's Progress (1949) and The Body Said No! (1950). He had what may be considered Rennie's only role as one of two central characters in a fully- fledged love story in the 47-minute episode \\"Sanatorium\\", the longest of the Somerset Maugham tales constituting the omnibus film Trio (1950); the 40-year- old Rennie and the 20-year-old Jean Simmons play patients and doomed lovers in the title institution, which caters to victims of tuberculosis. =Hollywood career= Rennie was one of several English actors cast in the 20th Century Fox medieval adventure story The Black Rose (1950), shot in England starring Tyrone Power and Orson Welles. Rennie was specifically cast as the 13th- century King Edward I, whose 6' 2\\" (1.88 m) frame gave origin to his historical nickname \\"Longshanks\\". He was fifth-billed after C√©cile Aubry and Jack Hawkins. Rennie became good friends with Power, who spoke well of the actor to Fox executives. Rennie's performance impressed Fox's studio head, Darryl F. Zanuck, who offered him a role in a film shot in Canada, The 13th Letter (1951). Directed by Otto Preminger, it was a remake of the French film Le Corbeau (The Raven, 1943), with the setting changed to the Canadian province of Quebec. Fox was so pleased with Rennie's work that it offered him a seven-year contract in November 1950. =The Day the Earth Stood Still= Rennie as Klaatu in The Day the Earth Stood Still. After Claude Rains turned down the role, Rennie received top billing in his next film, The Day the Earth Stood Still (also 1951), the first postwar, large-budget, \\"A\\" science-fiction film. It was a serious, high-minded exploration of mid-20th century suspicion and paranoia, combined with a philosophical overview of humanity's coming place in the larger universe. Rennie said director Robert Wise told him to do the role \\"with dignity but not with superiority\\". (The story was later dramatised in 1954 on Lux Radio Theatre, with Rennie and Billy Gray recreating their original film roles. Seven years later, on 3 March 1962, when The Day the Earth Stood Still made its television premiere on NBC's NBC Saturday Night at the Movies, Rennie appeared in a two-minute introductory prologue before the start of the film.) Rennie went on to support Power in I'll Never Forget You (1951) then had good roles in the ensemble drama Phone Call from a Stranger (1952) (where he played an American) and in the wartime spy thriller, 5 Fingers (1952), as the agent who tracks down James Mason's spy. He did some narration for The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel (1951) and would provide voice overs for several Fox films, such as Pony Soldier (1952), Titanic (1953), The Desert Rats (1953), Prince Valiant (1954). =Les Mis√©rables= Buoyed by the strong critical reception and profitability of The Day the Earth Stood Still, Fox assigned much of the credit to the central performance of Rennie. Convinced that it had a potential leading man under contract, the studio decided to produce a new version of Les Mis√©rables (1952) as a vehicle for him. The film was directed by Lewis Milestone, known for his early sound version of All Quiet on the Western Front. Rennie's performance was respectfully, but not enthusiastically, received by the critics. Ultimately, Les Mis√©rables returned an extremely modest profit and put an end to any further attempts to promote the 43-year-old Rennie as a potential star. This caused the studio to cancel a project he was attached to in 1952 ‚Äî Arms of Venus. He was, however, launched on a thriving career as a top supporting actor at Fox, often playing figures of authority, such as military officers or doctors. =Supporting actor at Fox= Rennie was second-billed in Sailor of the King (also known as Single-Handed, 1953), as an admiral, but it was very much in support of Jeffrey Hunter. He was leading man to Jeanne Crain in a thriller, Dangerous Crossing (1953), which re-used sets and props from Titanic (also 1953) for which Rennie spoke the closing narration. He had a showy role as Saint Peter in The Robe (1953), the first movie in CinemaScope and the biggest hit of the year. The star was Richard Burton, who had essentially taken Rennie's place on the Fox lot as their \\"resident British star\\". Rennie supported Power once more in King of the Khyber Rifles (1954), as a brigadier in British India, then played his first villain for Fox, an evil Khan in the \\"eastern\\", Princess of the Nile (1954), opposite Jeffrey Hunter. He reprised his role as Peter in Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954) and was lent out for Mambo (1954). In D√©sir√©e (1954), Rennie played the future Charles XIV John of Sweden opposite Marlon Brando as Napoleon Bonaparte. The film was popular though is not as highly regarded as other Brando films from this time. Soldier of Fortune (1955), was another hit, with Rennie as the head of British police in Hong Kong supporting Clark Gable and Susan Hayward. On TV he played the attorney in an adaptation of The Letter (1955) with John Mills. He also received good reviews for his performance as an art dealer in \\"A Man of Taste\\" (1955) for Climax with Zsa Zsa Gabor. Rennie enjoyed live TV. \\"You have greater performances as opposed to those in a filmed series\\", he said. \\"You are able to build and sustain a role in live TV whereas you have the problem of cutting, stopping and starting in a filmed show.\\" Based on the positive reaction to his two turns as the Apostle Peter, Fox assigned him another third-billed, top-tier role as a stalwart man of God, Franciscan friar Jun√≠pero Serra, who, between 1749 and his death in 1784, founded missions in Alta California. The film was Seven Cities of Gold (1955), with Richard Egan and Anthony Quinn. His next film was The Rains of Ranchipur (1955), assigned him fifth billing after the lead romantic teaming of Lana Turner and Richard Burton. As Turner's character's cuckolded husband, Lord Esketh, Rennie maintained his typical dignity and stiff upper lip. He supported Ginger Rogers in Teenage Rebel (1956) and had a good role as the man murdered by James Mason in Island in the Sun (1957), Darryl Zanuck's popular melodrama. His contract with Fox then wound up. =Post-20th Century-Fox= Rennie began his freelancing career supporting Cornel Wilde in Omar Khayyam (1957) at Paramount. He returned to Britain to play the lead in a war film Battle of the V-1 (1958). He was going to co-produce and star in a war film for Eros Films about bomb disposal experts. Getaway, but it was not made. Scheduling conflicts meant he missed out on a role in The Vikings (1958), being replaced by James Donald. He had top billing in a mountaineering film for Disney, Third Man on the Mountain (1959), although he was really the support for James MacArthur. Irwin Allen gave him a leading part at Fox, casting him as adventurer Lord John Roxton in an adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1960), a tale of a jungle expedition that finds prehistoric monsters in South America; the film also starred Claude Rains, Jill St. John and Richard Haydn. No longer bound by the no-television clause in his studio contract, he began his association with the medium. =The Third Man and Mary Mary= Rennie became a familiar face on television, taking the role of Harry Lime in The Third Man (1959‚Äì65), an Anglo-American syndicated television series very loosely derived from the film. It ran for several years but the schedule meant Rennie had plenty of time off to work on other projects. \\"Every scene of every show I do for money\\", he said. At the start of the 1960s, Michael Rennie made his only Broadway appearance in Mary, Mary playing Dirk Winsten, a jaded film star. After two previews, the sophisticated five- character marital comedy written by Jean Kerr and directed by Joseph Anthony opened at the Helen Hayes Theatre on 8 March 1961. It ran for a very successful 1,572 performances, closing at the Morosco Theatre on 12 December 1964. Rennie stayed with the production less than five months and was replaced by Michael Wilding in July 1961. When Warner Bros. cast the film version in early 1963, Rennie, along with leading man Barry Nelson and supporting actor Hiram Sherman (who joined the play two years after the opening in the part first played by John Cromwell) were the only Broadway cast members to carry over. Debbie Reynolds was given the title role created by Barbara Bel Geddes, and Warner's contract player Diane McBain, whom the studio saw as a potential star of the future, took over \\"the socialite part\\" essayed by Betsy von Furstenberg. Mervyn LeRoy produced and directed the film, which opened at Radio City Music Hall on 25 October 1963. During the 1960s, Rennie made guest appearances on such series as The Barbara Stanwyck Show, The Americans, Route 66 (a portrayal of a doomed pilot in the two-part episode \\"Fly Away Home\\"); Alfred Hitchcock Presents; Perry Mason (one of four actors in four consecutive episodes substituting for series star Raymond Burr, who was recovering from surgery); Wagon Train (a 90-minute colour episode as an English big game hunter); The Great Adventure (in an instalment of this anthology series about remarkable events in American history, he portrayed Confederate president Jefferson Davis); Daniel Boone, (in the episodes \\"The Sound of Wings\\" and \\"First in War, First in Peace\\"); Lost in Space (another two-part episode--as an all-powerful alien zookeeper, \\"The Keeper\\", he worked one last time with his Third Man co-star Jonathan Harris); The Time Tunnel (as Captain Smith of the Titanic, in the series' premiere episode); Batman (as the villainous Sandman, in league with Julie Newmar's Catwoman); three episodes of The Invaders (as a benign variation of the Klaatu persona, culminating in a parallel plot also involving an assembly of world leaders); an episode of I Spy (\\"Lana\\"); and two episodes of The F.B.I.; and was a THRUSH agent in an episode of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (1967 TV series) (\\"The Thrush Roulette Affair\\"/Barnaby Partridge). Also Branded. =Later films= Rennie's later films included Ride Beyond Vengeance (1966), Cyborg 2087 (1967), the all-star Hotel (1967), Death on the Run (1968), and The Young, the Evil and the Savage (1968). He completed what amounted to guest roles in two films, The Power and The Devil's Brigade (both 1968), before moving to Switzerland in the latter part of that year. His final seven feature films were filmed in Britain, Italy, Spain and, in the case of Surabaya Conspiracy, the Philippines. Personal life Rennie was married twice: first to Joan England (1912‚Äì1974) (1938‚Äì1945), then to actress Margaret (Maggie) McGrath (1919‚Äì2017) (1947‚Äì1960); their son, David Rennie, is an English circuit judge in Lewes, Sussex, England. Both marriages ended in divorce. When divorcing his second wife, she fainted on the stand during cross-examination. Rennie revealed he had been separated from her since November 1953. (Her mother had been murdered in 1954.) He had a son, John Marshall (born 1944), with his longtime friend and mistress, Ren√©e (n√©e Gilbert), whose later married name was Taylor. Ren√©e was the sister of the British film director Lewis Gilbert. During the war years, they lived coincidentally in flats in the White House in Albany Street near Regent's Park in London (now a hotel). The White House was a favourite location to live during the war years. It was built in the shape of a white cross and was such a good navigation mark for the Luftwaffe, that it was rumoured that there were standing orders to avoid bombing it ‚Äì hence its popularity with celebrities and the wealthy. Although Michael offered to accept paternity on discovering the news of her pregnancy, Ren√©e refused, as she was unwilling to jeopardise his growing success as a romantic lead in major feature films. However, Rennie kept a watchful eye on John Marshall over the years, even after his marriage to Maggie McGrath, and both families remained in constant touch until Rennie's death. In fact Ren√©e and Maggie lived for many years in the 1970s and 1980s within 200 yards of each other in Barnes and were close friends. Both Michael Rennie and his sister Bunny were very fond of Ren√©e's family. Coincidentally the British Film Institute's database lists Rennie as also having a son, John M. Taylor, who is described as \\"a producer.\\" John Marshall Rennie used the pseudonym \\"Taylor\\" during his long career in the industry to avoid accusations of nepotism. Michael Rennie was also briefly engaged to Mary Gardner, the ex-wife of Hollywood director Otto Preminger. In 1959, Preminger was divorcing Mary and claimed Rennie was having an affair with her. In 1958, Rennie said he earned $117,000 a year which provided him with $36,000 net. =Death= Less than three years after leaving Hollywood, he journeyed to his mother's home in Harrogate, Yorkshire, following the death of his brother. It was there that he died suddenly of an aortic aneurysm almost two months before his 62nd birthday. After his cremation, his ashes were interred in Harlow Hill Cemetery, Harrogate.

Description Brain affects the IBM PC by replacing the boot sector of a floppy disk with a copy of the virus. The real boot sector is moved to another sector and marked as bad. Infected disks usually have five kilobytes of bad sectors. The disk label is usually changed to ¬©Brain, and the following text can be seen in infected boot sectors: :\`Welcome to the Dungeon (c) 1986 Amjads (pvt) Ltd VIRUS_SHOE RECORD V9.0 Dedicated to the dynamic memories of millions of viruses who are no longer with us today - Thanks GOODNESS!!! BEWARE OF THE er..VIRUS : this program is catching program follows after these messages....$#@%$@!!\` There are many minor and major variations to that version of the text. The virus slows down the floppy disk drive and makes seven kilobytes of memory unavailable to DOS. Brain was written by Amjad Farooq Alvi and Basit Farooq Alvi, who at the time lived in Chah Miran, near Lahore Railway Station, in Lahore, Pakistan. The brothers told TIME magazine they had written it to protect their medical software from illegal copying, and it was supposed to target copyright infringement only. The cryptic message \\"Welcome to the Dungeon\\", a safeguard and reference to an early programming forum on Dungeon BBS, appeared after a year because the brothers licensed a beta version of the code. The brothers could not be contacted to receive the final release of this version of the program. Brain lacks code for dealing with hard disk partitioning, and avoids infecting hard disks by checking the most significant bit of the BIOS drive number being accessed. Brain does not infect the disk if the bit is clear, unlike other viruses at the time, which paid no attention to disk partitioning and consequently destroyed data stored on hard disks by treating them in the same way as floppy disks. Brain often went undetected, partially due to this deliberate non-destructiveness, especially when the user paid little to no attention to the low speed of floppy disk access. The virus came complete with the brothers' address and three phone numbers, and a message that told the user that their machine was infected and to call them for inoculation: : : This program was originally used to track a heart monitoring program for the IBM PC, and people were distributing illicit copies of the disks. This tracking program was supposed to stop and track illegal copies of the disk, however the program also sometimes used the last five kilobytes on an Apple floppy, making additional saves to the disk by other programs impossible. Author response When the brothers began to receive a large number of phone calls from people in the United Kingdom, the United States, and elsewhere, demanding that they disinfect their machines, they were stunned and tried to explain to the outraged callers that their motivation had not been malicious. Their phone lines were overloaded. The brothers, with another brother, Shahid Farooq Alvi, continued business in Pakistan, as Brain NET Internet service providers with a company called Brain Telecommunication Limited. In 2011, 25 years after Brain was released, Mikko Hypp√∂nen of F-Secure traveled to Pakistan to interview Amjad for a documentary. Being inspired by this documentary and its wide spread, a group of Pakistani bloggers interviewed Amjad, under the banner of Bloggerine. Variants Ashar is an older version of Brain.

He was known as the creative director of the French fashion house Chanel, a position held from 1983 until his death, and was also creative director of the Italian fur and leather goods fashion house Fendi, and of his own eponymous fashion label. He collaborated on a variety of fashion and art-related projects. Lagerfeld was recognized for his signature white hair, black sunglasses, fingerless gloves, and high, starched, detachable collars. Early life Lagerfeld was born on 10 September 1933 in Hamburg, to Elisabeth (n√©e Bahlmann) and businessman Otto Lagerfeld. His father owned a company that produced and imported evaporated milk; while his maternal grandfather, Karl Bahlmann, was a local politician for the Catholic Centre Party. His family belonged to the Old Catholic Church. When Lagerfeld's mother met his father, she was a lingerie saleswoman from Berlin. His parents married in 1930.Otto Lagerfeld , in Neue Deutsche Biographie Lagerfeld was known to misrepresent his birth year, claiming to be younger than his actual age, and to misrepresent his parents' background. For example, he claimed that he was born in 1938 to \\"Elisabeth of Germany\\" and Otto Ludwig Lagerfeldt from Sweden. These claims have been conclusively proven to be false, as his father was from Hamburg and spent his entire life in Germany, with no Swedish connection. There is also no evidence that his mother Elisabeth Bahlmann, the daughter of a middle-class local politician, called herself \\"Elisabeth of Germany\\". He was known to insist that no one knows his real birth date. In an interview on French television in February 2009, Lagerfeld said that he was \\"born neither in 1933 nor 1938\\".Interview on On n'est pas couch√©, France2, 21 February 2009 In April 2013, he finally declared that he was born in 1935. A birth announcement was, however, published by his parents in 1933, and the baptismal register in Hamburg also lists him as born in that year, showing that he was born on 10 September 1933.Der grosse Karl wird schon 80 Die Welt, 7 July 2013 biography at Munzinger-Archiv Bild am Sonntag published his baptismal records in 2008 and interviewed his teacher and a classmate, who both confirmed that he was born in 1933.

Lagerfeld had an older half-sister, Theodora Dorothea \\"Thea\\", from his father's first marriage. His family name has been spelled both Lagerfeldt (with a \\"t\\") and Lagerfeld. Like his father, he used the spelling Lagerfeld, considering it to \\"sound more commercial\\". His family was mainly shielded from the deprivations of World War II due to his father's business interests in Germany through the firm Gl√ºcksklee-Milch GmbH. His father had been in San Francisco during the 1906 earthquake.Horyn, Cathy, \\"Why Fashion Films Are Usually Cartoons,\\" The New York Times, Sun. 6 October 2013, p. 13 As a child, he showed great interest in visual arts, and former schoolmates recalled that he was always making sketches \\"no matter what we were doing in class\\".DW Documentary (2014), 14:00. Lagerfeld told interviewers that he learned much more by constantly visiting the Kunsthalle Hamburg museum than he ever did in school.DW Documentary (2014), 16:50. His greatest inspiration came from French artists, and he claimed to have only continued school in order to learn the French language so that he could move there. Lagerfeld finished his secondary school at the Lyc√©e Montaigne in Paris, where he majored in drawing and history. Career =Early career and Fendi (1955‚Äì1982)= In 1955, after living in Paris for two years, Lagerfeld entered a coat design competition sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat. He won the coat category and befriended Yves Saint Laurent, who won the dress category, and was soon after hired by Pierre Balmain. He worked as Balmain's assistant, and later apprentice, for three years. In 1958, Lagerfeld became the artistic director for Jean Patou. In 1964, he went to Rome to study art history and work for Tiziano but was soon designing freelance for a multitude of brands, including Charles Jourdan, Chlo√©, Krizia, and Valentino. In 1967, he was hired by Fendi to modernize their fur line. Lagerfeld's innovative designs proved groundbreaking, as he introduced the use of mole, rabbit, and squirrel pelts into high fashion. Lagerfeld remained with Fendi until his death. =International fame with Chanel (1982‚Äì2000)= Lagerfeld is credited with making great use of Chanel's \\"CC\\" logo during the 1980s In the 1980s, Lagerfeld was hired by Chanel, which was considered a \\"near-dead brand\\" at the time since the death of designer Coco Chanel a decade prior. Lagerfeld brought life back into the company, making it a huge success by revamping its ready- to-wear fashion line. Lagerfeld integrated the interlocked \\"CC\\" monograph of Coco Chanel into a style pattern for the House of Chanel. In 1984, a year after his start at Chanel, Lagerfeld began his own eponymous \\"Karl Lagerfeld\\" brand. The brand was established to channel \\"intellectual sexiness\\". In 1993, US Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour walked out of his Milan Fashion Week runway show, when he employed strippers and adult-film star Moana Pozzi to model his black-and-white collection for Fendi. =Later career (2001‚Äì2019)= Fashion In 2002, Lagerfeld asked Renzo Rosso, the founder of Diesel, to collaborate with him on a special denim collection for the Lagerfeld Gallery.Tungate, Mark: \\"Fifty\\". Gestalten Verlag; 2005. The collection, Lagerfeld Gallery by Diesel, was co-designed by Lagerfeld and then developed by Diesel's creative team, under the supervision of Rosso. It consisted of five pieces that were presented during the designer's catwalk shows during Paris Fashion Week and then sold in highly limited editions at the Lagerfeld Galleries in Paris and Monaco and at the Diesel Denim Galleries in New York and Tokyo. During the first week of sales in New York, more than 90% of the trousers were sold out, even though prices ranged from $240 to $1,840. In a statement after the show in Paris, Rosso said: \\"I am honored to have met this fashion icon of our time. Karl represents creativity, tradition and challenge, and the fact that he thought of Diesel for this collaboration is a great gift and acknowledgement of our reputation as the pr√™t-√†-porter of casual wear\\". Lagerfeld at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival In December 2006, Lagerfeld announced the launch of a new collection for men and women dubbed K Karl Lagerfeld, which included fitted T-shirts and a wide range of jeans. In September 2010, the Couture Council of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology presented Lagerfeld with an award created for him, The Couture Council Fashion Visionary Award, at a benefit luncheon at Avery Fisher Hall, in New York City. In November 2010, Lagerfeld and Swedish crystal manufacturer Orrefors announced a collaboration to design a crystal art collection. The first collection was launched in spring 2011, called Orrefors by Karl Lagerfeld. In 2014, Palm Beach Modern Auctions announced that many of Lagerfeld's early sketches for the House of Tiziani in Rome would be sold. Other media Lagerfeld and investments enterprise Dubai Infinity Holdings (DIH) signed a deal to design limited edition homes on the island of Isla Moda. A feature-length documentary film on the designer, Lagerfeld Confidential, was made by Vogue in 2007. Later in the year, Lagerfeld was made the host of the fictional radio station K109‚Äîthe studio in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV, Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned and Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony. In 2008, he created a teddy bear in his likeness produced by Steiff in an edition of 2,500 that sold for $1,500. and has been immortalized in many forms, which include pins, shirts, dolls, and more. In 2009, Tra Tutti began selling Karl Lagermouse and Karl Lagerfelt, which are mini-Lagerfelds in the forms of mice and finger puppets, respectively. The same year, he lent his voice to the French animated film, Totally Spies! The Movie. Late in life, Lagerfeld realized one of his boyhood ambitions by becoming a professional caricaturist ‚Äì from 2013, his political cartoons were regularly published in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.DW Documentary (2014), 5:35. Prince Albert II and Charlene, Princess of Monaco (2011) In 2013, he directed the short film Once Upon a Time... in the Cit√© du Cin√©ma, Saint-Denis, by Luc Besson, featuring Keira Knightley in the role of Coco Chanel and Clotilde Hesme as her aunt Adrienne Chanel. In June 2016, it was announced that Lagerfeld would design the two residential lobbies of the Estates at Acqualina, a residential development in Miami's Sunny Isles Beach. In October 2018, Lagerfeld in collaboration with Carpenters Workshop Gallery launched an art collection of functional sculptures titled Architectures. Sculptures were made of Arabescato Fantastico, a rare vibrant white marble with dark gray veins and black Nero Marquina marble with milky veins. Inspired by antiquity and referred to as modern mythology the ensemble consists of gueridons, tables, lamps, consoles, fountains and mirrors.Karl Lagerfelds first eversculptutal exhibition communicart.fr. Retrieved 19 February 2019 Personal life Lagerfeld was recognized for his signature white hair, black sunglasses, fingerless gloves, and high, starched detachable collars.Lagerfeld Confidential, 2007. He had an 18-year relationship with the French aristocrat, model, and socialite Jacques de Bascher (1951‚Äì1989), though Lagerfeld said that the liaison never became sexual. \\"I infinitely loved that boy,\\" Lagerfeld reportedly said of de Bascher, \\"but I had no physical contact with him. Of course, I was seduced by his physical charm.\\" De Bascher also had an affair with the couturier Yves Saint-Laurent; subsequently, Saint-Laurent's business partner and former lover Pierre Berge accused Lagerfeld of being behind a gambit to destabilize the rival fashion house. De Bascher died of AIDS in 1989 while Lagerfeld stayed on a cot at his bedside in his hospital room during the final stages of his illness. Following Lagerfeld's death, tabloids reported that he was to be cremated and his ashes mixed with those of de Bascher, which Lagerfeld kept in an urn, or with those of his mother. Lagerfeld lived in numerous homes over the years: an apartment in the rue de l'Universit√© in Paris, decorated in the Art Deco style (1970s); the 18th- century Chateau de Penho√´t in Brittany, decorated in the Rococo style (1970s to 2000); an apartment in Monte Carlo decorated until 2000 in 1980s Memphis style (from the early 1980s); the Villa Jako in Blankenese in Hamburg, decorated in the Art Deco style (mid-1990s to 2000); the Villa La Vigie in Monaco (the 1990s to 2000), a 17th-century mansion (h√¥tel particulier) in the Rue de l'Universit√© in Paris, decorated in the Rococo and other styles (1980s to the 2000s); an apartment in Manhattan, although he never moved into or decorated it (2006 to 2012); the summer villa El Horria in Biarritz, decorated in the modern style (1990s‚Äì2006); and a house dating from the 1840s in Vermont (from the 2000s). From 2007, Lagerfeld owned an 1820s house in Paris in Quai Voltaire decorated in modern and Art Deco style. A spread with pictures inside Lagerfeld's apartments in Paris and Monaco was published in Vogue. He also revealed his vast collection of Suzanne Belperron's pins and brooches and used the color of one of her blue chalcedony rings as the starting point for the Chanel spring/summer 2012 collection. Lagerfeld owned a red point Birman cat named Choupette, which, in June 2013, he indicated he would marry, if it were legal. =Weight loss= Lagerfeld lost in 2001. He explained: \\"I suddenly wanted to dress differently, to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane ... But these fashions, modeled by very, very slim boys‚Äîand not men my age‚Äîrequired me to lose at least 40 kg. It took me exactly 13 months.\\" The diet was created specially for him by Dr. Jean-Claude Houdret, which led to a book called The Karl Lagerfeld Diet. He promoted it on Larry King Live and other television shows. =Book collecting= Lagerfeld was a passionate book collector and amassed one of the largest personal libraries in the world. According to the Rare Book Hub, he was quoted as saying, \\"Today, I only collect books; there is no room left for something else. If you go to my house, I‚Äôll have you walk around the books. I ended up with a library of 300,000. It‚Äôs a lot for an individual.\\" =Death and tributes= Following health complications in January 2019, Lagerfeld was admitted to the American Hospital of Paris in Parisian suburb Neuilly-sur-Seine on 18 February. He died there the following morning from complications of pancreatic cancer. Lagerfeld requested no formal funeral with plans for cremation and ashes spread at secret locations alongside his mother as well as his late partner, Jacques de Bascher. Lagerfeld was memorialized on 20 June 2019 at the Grand Palais with \\"Karl For Ever\\", a celebration of the designer's life, which featured a career retrospective highlighting his tenures at Chlo√©, Fendi, and Chanel. The 90-minute tribute was attended by 2,500 guests. Nearly 60 gigantic portraits were on view within the pavilion, which has hosted many Chanel runway collections. The ceremony also included readings and musical performances by Tilda Swinton, Cara Delevingne, Helen Mirren, Pharrell Williams, and Lang Lang. The production was staged by theater and opera director Robert Carsen. Following the memorial, the house of Karl Lagerfeld announced in July 2019 the development of \\"The White Shirt Project\\". In homage to its eponymous founder, this collaboration celebrates the late designer's legacy with a collection of reimagined, iconic white shirts. Lagerfeld once said: \\"If you ask me what I‚Äôd most like to have invented in fashion, I‚Äôd say the white shirt. For me, the white shirt is the basis of everything. Everything else comes after.\\" The global project, which was curated by Karl Lagerfeld Style Adviser Carine Roitfeld features designs from Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss, Tommy Hilfiger, Diane Kruger, Takashi Murakami, Amber Valletta, and British street artist, Endless, amongst others. Seven was Lagerfeld's favorite number, and as such, seven of the final designs will be replicated 77 times and sold for ‚Ç¨777 each from 26 September 2019. All proceeds will benefit the French charity Sauver La Vie, which funds medical research at the Paris Descartes University. Controversies During his career, Lagerfeld was accused of being fatphobic, Islamophobic, of opposing the Me Too movement, and being racist. There was much controversy from Lagerfeld's use of a verse from the Qur'an in his spring 1994 couture collection for Chanel, despite apologies from the designer and the fashion house. The controversy erupted after the 1994 couture show in Paris, when the Indonesian Muslim Scholars Council in Jakarta called for a boycott of Chanel and threatened to file formal protests with the government of Lagerfeld's homeland, Germany. The designer apologized, explaining that he had taken the design from a book about the Taj Mahal, thinking the words came from a love poem. Lagerfeld was a supporter of the use of fur in fashion, although he himself did not wear fur and hardly ate meat. In a BBC interview in 2009, he claimed that hunters \\"make a living having learnt nothing else than hunting, killing those beasts who would kill us if they could\\" and maintained: \\"In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish.\\" Spokespersons for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) called Lagerfeld \\"a fashion dinosaur who is as out of step as his furs are out of style\\", and \\"particularly delusional with his kill-or-be-killed mentality. When was the last time a person's life was threatened by a mink or rabbit?\\" In 2001, he was the target of a pieing at a fashion premiere at Lincoln Center in New York City. However, the tofu pies hurled by animal rights activists in protest against his use of fur within his collections went astray, instead hitting Calvin Klein. A PETA spokesperson described the hit on Klein as \\"friendly fire\\", calling Klein, who does not use fur, \\"a great friend to the animals\\" and Lagerfeld a \\"designer dinosaur\\", who continues to use fur in his collections. In 2010, after Lagerfeld used fake fur in his 2010 Chanel collection, PETA's website claimed: \\"It's the triumph of fake fur ... because fake fur changed so much and became so great now that you can hardly see a difference\\". Lagerfeld in 2009 joined critics of supermodel Heidi Klum, following German designer Wolfgang Joop's remarks about Klum, who had posed naked on the cover of the German edition of GQ magazine. Joop described Klum as being \\"no runway model. She is simply too heavy and has too big a bust\\". Lagerfeld commented that neither he nor Claudia Schiffer knew Klum, as she had never worked in Paris, and that she was insignificant in the world of high fashion, being \\"more bling bling and glamorous than current fashion\\". He created an international furore on 9 February 2012, when he called the singer Adele \\"a little too fat.\\" Adele responded that she is like the majority of women, and she is very proud of that fact. Lagerfeld later caused another controversy, on 31 July 2012, when he criticised Pippa Middleton, the sister of Kate Middleton, for her looks. His caricature drawing Harvey Schweinstein, that shows film producer Harvey Weinstein as a pig, was criticised as antisemitic and dehumanizing.Der Mensch als Schwein. Karl Lagerfelds skandal√∂se Zeichnung. Die Welt, 11 November 2017. (in German) He sparked controversy by criticizing German Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policy during the European migrant crisis by saying, \\"You cannot kill millions of Jews and then take in millions of their worst enemies afterwards, even if there are decades [between the events]\\", and by accusing her to have thereby caused the rise of the party Alternative for Germany (AfD).Citing Holocaust, Karl Lagerfeld says Germany is taking in Jews' worst enemies.

After writing his first book on the subject in 1998, Edward became a well-known and controversial figure in the United States with his shows broadcast on the Sci- Fi Channel beginning in July 2000 and We TV since May 2006. John Edward is not related to psychic debunker Mark Edward. Biography The only son of an Irish-American police officer and an Italian-American working mother, Edward was raised Roman Catholic. Although Edward later stopped practicing that faith, he has said he never stopped feeling connected to God and is still closely connected to his Catholic roots. Edward once said, \\"This is something that is driven by a belief in God. It's the energy from that force that I think allows us to create this energy.\\" According to Edward, when he was 15 and \\"a huge doubter\\" (in psychic abilities), he was \\"read\\" by a New Jersey woman who convinced him that he could become a medium. > \\"She told me things that there is no way she could have known.

I thought she was full of > it until she started to tell me things no one in my life knew about... The > details were unbelievable.\\" Later, Edward worked as a phlebotomist while pursuing a degree in health care administration at Long Island University. He met his wife, Sandra McGee, when he was a student in a dance studio, and he became a ballroom dancing instructor before entering his current field of work. He and his wife had their first child, Justin, on September 25, 2002, and their second child, Olivia, on January 25, 2007. Television shows Edward published his first book, One Last Time, in 1998. His related appearance on Larry King Live later in the year prompted enough phone calls to overload the show's switchboard. The next year, Edward had a show of his own. =Crossing Over with John Edward= From 2001 to 2004, Edward was the producer and host of the show Crossing Over with John Edward, which has been syndicated and was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States and on Living TV in the UK. In Crossing Over, Edward gave psychic readings to audience members. Show format Readings in Crossing Over involve Edward questioning audience members with what is presented as information being communicated by their deceased friends and relatives. Edward says he receives images and clues from \\"the other side\\" which the audience must try to interpret. The audience is not supposed to supply Edward with any prior information about themselves, their family or whom they are trying to connect with \\"on the other side\\", aside from questionnaires filled out prior to taping. Audience members respond to Edward's statements and questions, adding any details they feel are appropriate. The show often employs a split screen, the view of a reading without sound on one half of the screen while on the other half the subjects of the reading are shown in a later interview as they discuss their experiences. A voiceover by Edward is also implemented at times, sharing further insights. In other instances, Edward conducted private sessions away from the studio audience. The subjects of these segments later talked in greater detail about the situation that led to their reading with Edward and the effect the reading had on their lives. Periodically, segments revisit people who have previously appeared on the show. 9/11 special Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Edward began filming at least one special in which he met with some relatives of the victims, with the intention of communicating with those who were killed. According to Edward's autobiography, he did not know that the producers had chosen the victims' families to appear on the show. The trade magazine Broadcasting & Cable sent a story, \\"'Psychic' Plans WTC Victims Show\\", on the daily subscription-fax sent to news media and TV-station executives on October 25, 2001. Steve Rosenberg, president of domestic television at Studios USA, the company that distributes Edward's program, had tentatively scheduled the program(s) to be broadcast during the November sweeps period, but news of the taping sparked a national outcry. Both the Sci Fi Channel and the Crossing Over with John Edward production office were flooded with phone calls and e-mails, some expressing outrage at the exploitation of the national tragedy, others at what they perceived as extreme tastelessness in search of ratings. Rosenberg initially ignored the criticism, insisting the programming would go on as scheduled, but within hours he terminated his plans. =John Edward Cross Country= Edward's next show, John Edward Cross Country, was broadcast on We TV from March 2006 to late 2008. In each episode, after a reading, Edward is filmed visiting the person or people whose reading was televised, along with their families, to see how the experience had changed their lives.John Edward Is One Psyched Psychic ‚Äì Today's News: Our Take .

The Futon Critic. Retrieved on May 11, 2012. International appearances Edward's tours outside the USA have included performances in Canada, Australia, the UK, and Ireland. In response to the announcement of his 2019 Australian tour, The Sydney Morning Herald published an article by Peter FitzSimons which called Edward a fraud, saying: FitzSimons concluded: Veracity of abilities Critics of Edward assert that he performs the mentalist techniques of hot reading and cold reading, in which one respectively uses prior knowledge or a wide array of quick and sometimes general guesses to create the impression of psychic ability. Choosing the first reading from a two-hour tape of edited shows as a sample, illusionist and skeptic James Randi found that just 3 of 23 statements made by Edward were confirmed as correct by the audience member being read, and the three statements that were correct were also trivial and nondescript. In another incident, Edward was said to have used foreknowledge to hot read in an interview on the television show Dateline. James Underdown of the Independent Investigative Group (IIG) attended a Crossing Over show in November 2002 and said \\"there were no indications of anyone I saw collecting information... none of his readings contained the kind of specific information that would raise an eyebrow of suspicion. ... John Edward was a bad cold reader. He, too, struggled to get hits, and in one attempt shot off nearly 40 guesses before finding any significant targets.\\" Underdown also claimed that Edward's apparent accuracy on television may be inflated by the editing process. After watching the broadcast version of the show he had attended and recorded, Underdown attributed a great deal of Edward's accuracy on television to editing and wrote, \\"Edward's editor fine-tuned many of the dead-ends out of a reading riddled with misses.\\" In 2002, Edward said, \\"People are in the studio for eight hours, and we have to edit the show for time, not content. We don't try to hide the 'misses'.\\" Edward has denied ever using hot or cold reading techniques. In March 2018, skeptical activist Susan Gerbic published an article in Skeptical Inquirer summarizing a number of techniques which she says are used by psychics, such as Edward, to achieve their effects. In a 2019 segment of Last Week Tonight, Edward and other prominent TV psychics were featured. Several clips of Edward attempting cold reading and failing to get \\"hits\\" were included, as well as a clip of Edward telling an audience member, \\"I can only tell you what they're showing me, and if he's calling your mother a bitch, I'm gonna pass that on.\\" John Oliver criticized the predatory nature of the psychic industry, as well as the media for promoting psychics, because this convinces viewers that psychic powers are real, and so enables neighborhood psychics to prey on grieving families. Oliver said \\"...when psychic abilities are presented as authentic, it emboldens a vast underworld of unscrupulous vultures, more than happy to make money by offering an open line to the afterlife, as well as many other bullshit services.\\" =Paranormal study= Gary Schwartz, a psychologist and researcher in the field of parapsychology, designed and administered a series of tests for Edward and several other mediums to investigate their paranormal claims and published his belief that Edward's abilities were genuine in his book The Afterlife Experiments. The study did not undergo scientific peer review, and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's Ray Hyman, a psychologist and critic of parapsychology, wrote a detailed critique of Schwartz's methodology and conclusions in a 2003 issue of Skeptical Inquirer. Schwartz responded to the critique, leading Hyman to write a rebuttal. Appearances in the media Edward has appeared or been mentioned in many television shows, including: ABC's 20/20,The ABC News report is viewable here.

The Adult animated TV series South Park featured Edward in the episode \\"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\\", where Edward is portrayed as a cold reading conman. The series' co-creator, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, credit James Randi for Stan's explanation of cold reading.

Plasma TVs were the first flat panel displays to be released to the public. Until about 2007, plasma displays were commonly used in large televisions ( and larger). Since then, they have lost nearly all market share due to competition from low-cost LCDs and more expensive but high-contrast OLED flat-panel displays. Manufacturing of plasma displays for the United States retail market ended in 2014, and manufacturing for the Chinese market ended in 2016. Plasma displays are obsolete, having been superseded in most if not all aspects by OLED displays. General characteristics Plasma displays are bright (1,000 lux or higher for the module), have a wide color gamut, and can be produced in fairly large sizes‚Äîup to diagonally. They had a very low luminance \\"dark-room\\" black level compared with the lighter grey of the unilluminated parts of an LCD screen. (As plasma panels are locally lit and do not require a back light, blacks are blacker on plasma and grayer on LCD's.)HDGuru.com ‚Äì Choosing The HDTV That‚Äôs Right For You LED-backlit LCD televisions have been developed to reduce this distinction. The display panel itself is about thick, generally allowing the device's total thickness (including electronics) to be less than . Power consumption varies greatly with picture content, with bright scenes drawing significantly more power than darker ones ‚Äì this is also true for CRTs as well as modern LCDs where LED backlight brightness is adjusted dynamically. The plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least 1200 ¬∞C (2200 ¬∞F). Typical power consumption is 400 watts for a screen. Most screens are set to \\"vivid\\" mode by default in the factory (which maximizes the brightness and raises the contrast so the image on the screen looks good under the extremely bright lights that are common in big box stores), which draws at least twice the power (around 500‚Äì700 watts) of a \\"home\\" setting of less extreme brightness.PlasmaTelevisions.org ‚Äì How to Calibrate Your Plasma TV The lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours (11 years) of actual display time, or 27 years at 10 hours per day. This is the estimated time over which maximum picture brightness degrades to half the original value.PlasmaTVBuyingGuide.com ‚Äì How Long Do Plasma TVs Last? Meow Plasma screens are made out of glass, which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources. Currently, plasma panels cannot be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than . Although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced-definition televisions (EDTV) this small, even fewer have made 32 inch plasma HDTVs. With the trend toward large-screen television technology, the 32 inch screen size is rapidly disappearing. Though considered bulky and thick compared with their LCD counterparts, some sets such as Panasonic's Z1 and Samsung's B860 series are as slim as thick making them comparable to LCDs in this respect. Competing display technologies include cathode ray tube (CRT), organic light-emitting diode (OLED), CRT projectors, AMLCD, Digital Light Processing DLP, SED-tv, LED display, field emission display (FED), and quantum dot display (QLED). Plasma display advantages and disadvantages =Advantages= * Capable of producing deeper blacks allowing for a superior contrast ratio.HomeTheaterMag.com ‚Äì Plasma Vs. LCD * As they use the same or similar phosphors as are used in CRT displays, plasma's color reproduction is very similar to that of CRTs. * Wider viewing angles than those of LCD; images do not suffer from degradation at less than straight ahead angles like LCDs. LCDs using IPS technology have the widest angles, but they do not equal the range of plasma primarily due to \\"IPS glow\\", a generally whitish haze that appears due to the nature of the IPS pixel design. * Less visible motion blur, thanks in large part to very high refresh rates and a faster response time, contributing to superior performance when displaying content with significant amounts of rapid motion such as auto racing, hockey, baseball, etc.Google books ‚Äì Principles of Multimedia By Ranjan Parekh, RanjanGoogle books ‚Äì The electronics handbook By Jerry C. Whitaker * Superior uniformity. LCD panel backlights nearly always produce uneven brightness levels, although this is not always noticeable. High-end computer monitors have technologies to try to compensate for the uniformity problem. * Unaffected by clouding from the polishing process. Some LCD panel types, like IPS, require a polishing process that can introduce a haze usually referred to as \\"clouding\\". * Less expensive for the buyer per square inch than LCD, particularly when equivalent performance is considered. =Disadvantages= * Earlier generation displays were more susceptible to screen burn-in and image retention. Recent models have a pixel orbiter that moves the entire picture slower than is noticeable to the human eye, which reduces the effect of burn-in but does not prevent it. * Due to the bistable nature of the color and intensity generating method, some people will notice that plasma displays have a shimmering or flickering effect with a number of hues, intensities and dither patterns. * Earlier generation displays (circa 2006 and prior) had phosphors that lost luminosity over time, resulting in gradual decline of absolute image brightness. Newer models have advertised lifespans exceeding 100,000 hours (11 years), far longer than older CRTs. * Uses more electrical power, on average, than an LCD TV using a LED backlight. Older CCFL backlights for LCD panels used quite a bit more power, and older plasma TVs used quite a bit more power than recent models.LED LCD vs. plasma vs. LCD, 2013 * Does not work as well at high altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) due to pressure differential between the gases inside the screen and the air pressure at altitude.

Native plasma television resolutions Fixed-pixel displays such as plasma TVs scale the video image of each incoming signal to the native resolution of the display panel. The most common native resolutions for plasma display panels are 853√ó480 (EDTV), 1,366√ó768 or 1920√ó1080 (HDTV). As a result, picture quality varies depending on the performance of the video scaling processor and the upscaling and downscaling algorithms used by each display manufacturer.PlasmaTVBuyingGuide.com ‚Äì Step 3: Is a 1080p Resolution Plasma TV Worth the Extra Money?AfterDawn.com ‚Äì Native Resolution =Enhanced-definition plasma television= Early plasma televisions were enhanced-definition (ED) with a native resolution of 840√ó480 (discontinued) or 853√ó480, and down-scaled their incoming High-definition video signals to match their native display resolution.PlasmaTVBuyingGuide.com ‚Äì EDTV Plasma vs. HDTV Plasma ED resolutions The following ED resolutions were common prior to the introduction of HD displays, but have long been phased out in favor of HD displays, as well as because the overall pixel count in ED displays is lower than the pixel count on SD PAL displays (853√ó480 vs 720√ó576, respectively). * 840√ó480p * 853√ó480p =High-definition plasma television= Early high- definition (HD) plasma displays had a resolution of 1024x1024 and were alternate lighting of surfaces (ALiS) panels made by Fujitsu/Hitachi.CNET UK ‚Äì ALiS (alternate lighting of surfaces) Google Books ‚Äì Newnes Guide to Television and Video Technology By K.

These displays are usually progressive displays, with non-square pixels, and will up-scale and de-interlace their incoming standard- definition signals to match their native display resolution. 1024√ó768 resolution requires that 720p content be downscaled in one direction and upscaled in the other.About.com ‚Äì Are All Plasma Televisions HDTVs?Practical Home Theater Guide ‚Äì Plasma TV FAQs Design Ionized gases such as the ones shown here are confined to millions of tiny individual compartments across the face of a plasma display, to collectively form a visual image. Composition of plasma display panel A panel of a plasma display typically comprises millions of tiny compartments in between two panels of glass. These compartments, or \\"bulbs\\" or \\"cells\\", hold a mixture of noble gases and a minuscule amount of another gas (e.g., mercury vapor). Just as in the fluorescent lamps over an office desk, when a high voltage is applied across the cell, the gas in the cells forms a plasma. With flow of electricity (electrons), some of the electrons strike mercury particles as the electrons move through the plasma, momentarily increasing the energy level of the atom until the excess energy is shed. Mercury sheds the energy as ultraviolet (UV) photons. The UV photons then strike phosphor that is painted on the inside of the cell. When the UV photon strikes a phosphor molecule, it momentarily raises the energy level of an outer orbit electron in the phosphor molecule, moving the electron from a stable to an unstable state; the electron then sheds the excess energy as a photon at a lower energy level than UV light; the lower energy photons are mostly in the infrared range but about 40% are in the visible light range. Thus the input energy is converted to mostly infrared but also as visible light. The screen heats up to between during operation. Depending on the phosphors used, different colors of visible light can be achieved. Each pixel in a plasma display is made up of three cells comprising the primary colors of visible light. Varying the voltage of the signals to the cells thus allows different perceived colors. The long electrodes are stripes of electrically conducting material that also lies between the glass plates in front of and behind the cells. The \\"address electrodes\\" sit behind the cells, along the rear glass plate, and can be opaque. The transparent display electrodes are mounted in front of the cell, along the front glass plate. As can be seen in the illustration, the electrodes are covered by an insulating protective layer. Paid access. Control circuitry charges the electrodes that cross paths at a cell, creating a voltage difference between front and back. Some of the atoms in the gas of a cell then lose electrons and become ionized, which creates an electrically conducting plasma of atoms, free electrons, and ions. The collisions of the flowing electrons in the plasma with the inert gas atoms leads to light emission; such light-emitting plasmas are known as glow discharges. Relative spectral power of red, green and blue phosphors of a common plasma display. The units of spectral power are simply raw sensor values (with a linear response at specific wavelengths). In a monochrome plasma panel, the gas is mostly neon, and the color is the characteristic orange of a neon-filled lamp (or sign). Once a glow discharge has been initiated in a cell, it can be maintained by applying a low-level voltage between all the horizontal and vertical electrodes‚Äìeven after the ionizing voltage is removed. To erase a cell all voltage is removed from a pair of electrodes. This type of panel has inherent memory. A small amount of nitrogen is added to the neon to increase hysteresis. In color panels, the back of each cell is coated with a phosphor. The ultraviolet photons emitted by the plasma excite these phosphors, which give off visible light with colors determined by the phosphor materials. This aspect is comparable to fluorescent lamps and to the neon signs that use colored phosphors. Every pixel is made up of three separate subpixel cells, each with different colored phosphors. One subpixel has a red light phosphor, one subpixel has a green light phosphor and one subpixel has a blue light phosphor. These colors blend together to create the overall color of the pixel, the same as a triad of a shadow mask CRT or color LCD. Plasma panels use pulse-width modulation (PWM) to control brightness: by varying the pulses of current flowing through the different cells thousands of times per second, the control system can increase or decrease the intensity of each subpixel color to create billions of different combinations of red, green and blue. In this way, the control system can produce most of the visible colors. Plasma displays use the same phosphors as CRTs, which accounts for the extremely accurate color reproduction when viewing television or computer video images (which use an RGB color system designed for CRT displays). Plasma displays are different from liquid crystal displays (LCDs), another lightweight flat-screen display using very different technology. LCDs may use one or two large fluorescent lamps as a backlight source, but the different colors are controlled by LCD units, which in effect behave as gates that allow or block light through red, green, or blue filters on the front of the LCD panel.CNET Australia ‚Äì Plasma vs. LCD: Which is right for you?Afterdawn.com ‚Äì Plasma displayGizmodo ‚Äì Giz Explains: Plasma TV Basics Contrast ratio Contrast ratio is the difference between the brightest and darkest parts of an image, measured in discrete steps, at any given moment. Generally, the higher the contrast ratio, the more realistic the image is (though the \\"realism\\" of an image depends on many factors including color accuracy, luminance linearity, and spatial linearity.) Contrast ratios for plasma displays are often advertised as high as 5,000,000:1. On the surface, this is a significant advantage of plasma over most other current display technologies, a notable exception being organic light-emitting diode. Although there are no industry- wide guidelines for reporting contrast ratio, most manufacturers follow either the ANSI standard or perform a full-on-full-off test. The ANSI standard uses a checkered test pattern whereby the darkest blacks and the lightest whites are simultaneously measured, yielding the most accurate \\"real-world\\" ratings. In contrast, a full-on-full-off test measures the ratio using a pure black screen and a pure white screen, which gives higher values but does not represent a typical viewing scenario. Some displays, using many different technologies, have some \\"leakage\\" of light, through either optical or electronic means, from lit pixels to adjacent pixels so that dark pixels that are near bright ones appear less dark than they do during a full-off display. Manufacturers can further artificially improve the reported contrast ratio by increasing the contrast and brightness settings to achieve the highest test values. However, a contrast ratio generated by this method is misleading, as content would be essentially unwatchable at such settings.Google books ‚Äì Digital Signage Broadcasting By Lars-Ingemar Lundstr√∂mGoogle books ‚Äì Instrument Engineers' Handbook: Process control and optimization By B√©la G. Lipt√°kGoogle books ‚Äì Computers, Software Engineering, and Digital Devices By Richard C. Dorf Each cell on a plasma display must be precharged before it is lit, otherwise the cell would not respond quickly enough. This precharging means the cells cannot achieve a true black,, whereas an LED backlit LCD panel can actually turn off parts of the backlight, in \\"spots\\" or \\"patches\\" (this technique, however, does not prevent the large accumulated passive light of adjacent lamps, and the reflection media, from returning values from within the panel). Some manufacturers have reduced the precharge and the associated background glow, to the point where black levels on modern plasmas are starting to become close to some high-end CRTs Sony and Mitsubishi produced ten years before the comparable plasma displays. It is important to note that plasma displays were developed for ten more years than CRTs; it is almost certain that if CRTs had been developed for as long as plasma displays were, the contrast on CRTs would have been far better than contrast on the plasma displays. With an LCD, black pixels are generated by a light polarization method; many panels are unable to completely block the underlying backlight. More recent LCD panels using LED illumination can automatically reduce the backlighting on darker scenes, though this method cannot be used in high-contrast scenes, leaving some light showing from black parts of an image with bright parts, such as (at the extreme) a solid black screen with one fine intense bright line. This is called a \\"halo\\" effect which has been minimized on newer LED-backlit LCDs with local dimming. Edgelit models cannot compete with this as the light is reflected via a light guide to distribute the light behind the panel. Screen burn-in An example of a plasma display that has suffered severe burn-in from static text Image burn-in occurs on CRTs and plasma panels when the same picture is displayed for long periods. This causes the phosphors to overheat, losing some of their luminosity and producing a \\"shadow\\" image that is visible with the power off. Burn-in is especially a problem on plasma panels because they run hotter than CRTs. Early plasma televisions were plagued by burn-in, making it impossible to use video games or anything else that displayed static images. Plasma displays also exhibit another image retention issue which is sometimes confused with screen burn-in damage. In this mode, when a group of pixels are run at high brightness (when displaying white, for example) for an extended period, a charge build-up in the pixel structure occurs and a ghost image can be seen. However, unlike burn-in, this charge build-up is transient and self-corrects after the image condition that caused the effect has been removed and a long enough period has passed (with the display either off or on). Plasma manufacturers have tried various ways of reducing burn-in such as using gray pillarboxes, pixel orbiters and image washing routines, but none to date have eliminated the problem and all plasma manufacturers continue to exclude burn-in from their warranties.PlasmaTVBuyingGuide.com ‚Äì Plasma TV Screen Burn-In: Is It Still a Problem? Environmental impact Plasma screens use significantly more energy than CRT and LCD screens. To reduce the energy consumption, new technologies are also being found. History =Early development= Plasma displays were first used in PLATO computer terminals. This PLATO V model illustrates the display's monochromatic orange glow seen in 1981.Google books ‚Äì Michael Allen's 2008 E-Learning Annual By Michael W. Allen In 1927, a team from Bell Telephone Laboratories demonstrated television transmission from Washington to New York, using a prototype flat panel plasma display to make the images visible to an audience. The monochrome display measured two feet by three feet and had 2500 pixels. K√°lm√°n Tihanyi, a Hungarian engineer, described a proposed flat-panel plasma display system in a 1936 paper. The first practical plasma video display was co-invented in 1964 at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign by Donald Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and graduate student Robert Willson for the PLATO computer system. The original neon orange monochrome Digivue display panels built by glass producer Owens-Illinois were very popular in the early 1970s because they were rugged and needed neither memory nor circuitry to refresh the images.Brian Dear, Chapter 6 ‚Äì Gas and Glass, The Friendly Orange Glow, Pantheon Books, New York, 2017; pages 92-111 cover the development and first stages AC plasma panel commercialization. A long period of sales decline occurred in the late 1970s because semiconductor memory made CRT displays cheaper than the $2500 USD PLATO plasma displays.Brian Dear, Chapter 22 ‚Äì The Business Opportunity, The Friendly Orange Glow, Pantheon Books, New York, 2017; pages 413‚Äì417 cover CDC's decision to use CRTs with cheap video-RAM instead of plasma panels in 1975. Nonetheless, the plasma displays' relatively large screen size and 1 inch thickness made them suitable for high-profile placement in lobbies and stock exchanges. Burroughs Corporation, a maker of adding machines and computers, developed the Panaplex display in the early 1970s. The Panaplex display, generically referred to as a gas-discharge or gas-plasma display, uses the same technology as later plasma video displays, but began life as a seven-segment display for use in adding machines. They became popular for their bright orange luminous look and found nearly ubiquitous use throughout the late 1970s and into the 1990s in cash registers, calculators, pinball machines, aircraft avionics such as radios, navigational instruments, and stormscopes; test equipment such as frequency counters and multimeters; and generally anything that previously used nixie tube or numitron displays with a high digit-count. These displays were eventually replaced by LEDs because of their low current-draw and module-flexibility, but are still found in some applications where their high brightness is desired, such as pinball machines and avionics. =1983= In 1983, IBM introduced a orange-on-black monochrome display (model 3290 'information panel') which was able to show up to four simultaneous IBM 3270 terminal sessions. Due to heavy competition from monochrome LCDs used in laptops of the era and the high costs of plasma display technology, in 1987 IBM planned to shut down its factory in upstate New York, the largest plasma plant in the world, in favor of manufacturing mainframe computers, which would have left development to Japanese companies.Ogg, E., \\"Getting a charge out of plasma TV\\", CNET News, June 18, 2007, retrieved 2008-11-24. Dr. Larry F. Weber, a University of Illinois ECE PhD (in plasma display research) and staff scientist working at CERL (home of the PLATO System) co-founded a startup company Plasmaco with Stephen Globus, as well as James Kehoe, who was the IBM plant manager, and bought the plant from IBM for US$50,000. Weber stayed in Urbana as CTO until 1990, then moved to upstate New York to work at Plasmaco. =1990s= 1992 In 1992, Fujitsu introduced the world's first 21-inch (53 cm) full-color display. It was a hybrid, the plasma display created at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories. 1994 In 1994, Weber demonstrated a color plasma display at an industry convention in San Jose. Panasonic Corporation began a joint development project with Plasmaco, which led in 1996 to the purchase of Plasmaco for US$26 million, its color AC technology, and its American factory. 1995 In 1995, Fujitsu introduced the first plasma display panel;Weber, L. F., \\"History of the Plasma Display Panel,\\" IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, Vol. 34, No. 2, (April, 2006), pp.268-278. it had 852x480 resolution and was progressively scanned.Mendrala, Jim, \\"Flat Panel Plasma Display\\", North West Tech Notes, No. 4, June 15, 1997, retrieved 2009-01-29. Also in 1997, Philips introduced a display, with 852x480 resolution. It was the only plasma to be displayed to the retail public in four Sears locations in the US and the first plasma TV in the world, using the plasma display panel from Fujitsu mentioned above. The price was US$14,999 and included in-home installation. Later in 1997, Pioneer started selling their first plasma television to the public, and others followed. By the year 2000 prices had dropped to US$10,000. =2000s= In the year 2000, the first 60-inch plasma display was developed by Plasmaco. Panasonic was also reported to have developed a process to make plasma displays using ordinary window glass instead of the much more expensive \\"high strain point\\" glass.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB967587676614566981#:~:text=When%20plasma%2Dgas%20technology%20was,quality%20standards%20for%20the%20sets. 2006‚Äì2009 Average plasma displays have become one quarter the thickness from 2006 to 2011 In late 2006, analysts noted that LCDs overtook plasmas, particularly in the 40-inch (1.0 m) and above segment where plasma had previously gained market share.\\"Shift to large LCD TVs over plasma\\", MSNBC, November 27, 2006, retrieved 2007-08-12. Another industry trend is the consolidation of manufacturers of plasma displays, with around 50 brands available but only five manufacturers. In the first quarter of 2008, a comparison of worldwide TV sales breaks down to 22.1 million for direct-view CRT, 21.1 million for LCD, 2.8 million for Plasma, and 0.1 million for rear- projection.\\"LCD televisions outsell plasma 8 to 1 worldwide\\" , Digital Home, 21 May 2008, retrieved 2008-06-13. Until the early 2000s, plasma displays were the most popular choice for HDTV flat panel display as they had many benefits over LCDs. Beyond plasma's deeper blacks, increased contrast, faster response time, greater color spectrum, and wider viewing angle; they were also much bigger than LCDs, and it was believed that LCDs were suited only to smaller sized televisions. However, improvements in VLSI fabrication have since narrowed the technological gap. The increased size, lower weight, falling prices, and often lower electrical power consumption of LCDs made them competitive with plasma television sets. Screen sizes have increased since the introduction of plasma displays. The largest plasma video display in the world at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, was a unit manufactured by Matsushita Electric Industrial (Panasonic) standing 6 ft (180 cm) tall by 11 ft (330 cm) wide.Dugan, Emily., \\"6ft by 150 inches ‚Äì and that's just the TV\\", The Independent, 8 January 2008, retrieved 2009-01-29.PCMag.com ‚Äì Panasonic's 150-Inch \\"Life Screen\\" Plasma Opens CES =2010s= At the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Panasonic introduced their 152\\" 2160p 3D plasma.

This decline has been attributed to the competition from liquid crystal (LCD) televisions, whose prices have fallen more rapidly than those of the plasma TVs. In late 2013, Panasonic announced that they would stop producing plasma TVs from March 2014 onwards. In 2014, LG and Samsung discontinued plasma TV production as well, effectively killing the technology, probably because of lowering demand.

He was highly influenced by constructivism and a strong advocate of the integration of technology and industry into the arts. The art critic Peter Schjeldahl called him \\"relentlessly experimental\\" because of his pioneering work in painting, drawing, photography, collage, sculpture, film, theater, and writing. He also worked collaboratively with other artists, including his first wife Lucia Moholy, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Herbert Bayer. His largest accomplishment may be the School of Design in Chicago, which survives today as part of the Illinois Institute of Technology, which art historian Elizabeth Siegel called \\"his overarching work of art\\". He also wrote books and articles advocating a utopian type of high modernism. Early life and education (1895‚Äì1922) Moholy-Nagy was born L√°szl√≥ Weisz in B√°csbors√≥d (Hungary), to a Jewish family.Chilvers, Ian & Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art , Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 471‚Äì472 His mother's second cousin was the conductor Sir Georg Solti. L√°szl√≥ was the middle child of three surviving sons, but the family was soon abandoned by the father, Lip√≥t Weisz. The remainder of the family took protection and support from the maternal uncle, Guszt√°v Nagy. The uncle was a lawyer, and sponsored the education of L√°szl√≥ and his younger brother, √Åkos. In turn, L√°szl√≥ took the Magyar surname of his mentor. Later, he added \\"Moholy\\" to his surname, after the name of the town of Mohol (now part of Serbia) where he spent part of his boyhood in the family home nearby. L√°szl√≥ attended a gymnasium school in the city of Szeged, which was the second- largest city in the country. Initially he wanted to become a writer or poet, and in 1911 some of his poems were published in local daily newspapers. Starting in 1913, he studied law at the University of Budapest. In 1915 during World War I, he enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian army as an artillery officer. In service, he also made crayon sketches, watercolors, and writings to document his wartime experiences. He was injured on the Russian Front in 1917, and convalesced in Budapest. While on leave and during convalescence, Moholy- Nagy became involved first with the journal Jelenkor (\\"The Present Age\\"), edited by Hevesy, and then with the \\"Activist\\" circle around Lajos Kass√°k‚Äôs journal Ma (\\"Today\\"). After his discharge from the military in October 1918, he abandoned his law studies and attended the private art school of the Hungarian Fauve artist R√≥bert Ber√©ny. In 1918, he formally converted to the Hungarian Reformed Church; his godfather was his Roman Catholic university friend, the art critic Iv√°n Hevesy. He was a supporter of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, declared early in 1919, though he assumed no official role in it. After the defeat of the Communist regime in August, he withdrew to Szeged. An exhibition of his work was held there, before he left for Vienna around November 1919. Moholy-Nagy moved to Berlin early in 1920, where he met photographer and writer Lucia Schulz; they married the next year. In 1922, at a joint exhibition with fellow Hungarian Peter Laszlo Peri at Der Sturm, he met Walter Gropius. That summer, he vacationed on the Rhone with Lucia, who introduced him to making photograms on light-sensitized paper. He also began sketching ideas for what would become his most well-known sculpture, the Light-Space Modulator. Bauhaus years (1923‚Äì1928) Jealousy (1927) In 1923, Moholy-Nagy was invited by Walter Gropius to teach at the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany. He took over Johannes Itten's role co-teaching the Bauhaus foundation course with Josef Albers, and also replaced Paul Klee as Head of the Metal Workshop.Bauhaus100. Preliminary course. (Accessed: February 7, 2017)Bauhaus100. Metal workshop (Accessed: February 7, 2017) This effectively marked the end of the school‚Äôs expressionistic leanings and moved it closer towards its original aims as a school of design and industrial integration. The Bauhaus became known for the versatility of its artists, and Moholy-Nagy was no exception. Throughout his career, he became proficient and innovative in the fields of photography, typography, sculpture, painting, printmaking, film-making, and industrial design. One of his main focuses was photography; starting in 1922, he had been initially guided by the technical expertise of his first wife and collaborator Lucia Moholy.Findeli, A. (1987).

With Lucia, he experimented with the photogram; the process of exposing light- sensitive paper with objects laid upon it. His teaching practice covered a diverse range of media, including painting, sculpture, photography, photomontage, and metalworking.

An iconic achievement was Moholy- Nagy's construction of the Lichtrequisit einer elektrischen B√ºhne (Light Prop for an Electric Stage) (1928‚Äì1930), a device with moving parts designed to have light projected through it to create shifting light reflections and shadows on nearby surfaces.Tate bio Retrieved January 17, 2011Light Art Retrieved January 17, 2011 It was made with the help of the Hungarian architect Istvan Seboek for the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition held in Paris during the summer of 1930; it was later dubbed the Light-Space Modulator and was seen as a pioneer achievement of kinetic sculpture using industrial materials like reflective metals and Plexiglas. Given his interest in the light patterns it produced more than its appearance when viewed directly, it might more accurately be seen as one of the earliest examples of Light art. This was a form that he continued to develop in the 1940s in the United States, in Space Modulator (1939‚Äì1945), Papmac (1943), and B-10 Space Modulator (1942).Moholy-Nagy, L√°szl√≥ d 1895‚Äì1946 & Witkovsky, Matthew S., 1967‚Äì, (editor.) & Eliel, Carol S., 1955‚Äì, (editor.) & Vail, Karole P.

Moholy-Nagy was photography editor of the Dutch avant-garde magazine International Revue i 10 from 1927 to 1929. He designed stage sets for successful and controversial operatic and theatrical productions, designed exhibitions and books, created ad campaigns, wrote articles, and made films. His studio employed artists and designers such as Istvan Seboek, Gy√∂rgy Kepes, and Andor Weininger. In 1931, he met actress and scriptwriter Sibylle Pietzsch. They married in 1932 and had two daughters, Hattula (born 1933), and Claudia (1936‚Äì1971). Sibyl collaborated with her husband to make Ein Lichtspiel: schwarz weiss grau (\\"A Lightplay: Black White Gray\\"), a now- classic film based on the Light-Space Modulator. She also would also work with him on the films Gypsies and Berlin Still Life, and would remain with him for the rest of his life, later becoming an art and architectural historian. After the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, as a foreign citizen, he was no longer allowed to work there. He worked in 1934 in the Netherlands (doing mostly commercial work) before moving with his family to London in 1935. In England, Moholy-Nagy formed part of the circle of √©migr√© artists and intellectuals who based themselves in Hampstead. Moholy-Nagy lived in the Isokon building with Walter Gropius for eight months and then settled in Golders Green. Gropius and Moholy-Nagy planned to establish an English version of the Bauhaus but could not secure backing, and then Moholy-Nagy was turned down for a teaching job at the Royal College of Art. Moholy-Nagy earned a living in London by taking on various commercial design jobs, including work for Imperial Airways and a shop display for men's underwear. Gy√∂rgy Kepes worked with him on various commercial assignments. He photographed contemporary architecture for the Architectural Review where the assistant editor was John Betjeman who commissioned Moholy-Nagy to make documentary photographs to illustrate his book An Oxford University Chest. He was commissioned to make the films Lobsters (1935) and New Architecture and the London Zoo (1936). He began to experiment with painting on transparent plastics, such as Perspex. In 1936, he was commissioned by fellow Hungarian film producer Alexander Korda to design special effects for the now-classic film Things to Come, based on the novel by H. G. Wells. Working at Denham Studios, Moholy-Nagy created kinetic sculptures and abstract light effects, but they were mostly unused by the film's director. At the invitation of Leslie Martin, he gave a lecture to the architecture school of Hull School of Art. In 1937 his artworks were included in the infamous \\"Degenerate art\\" exhibition held by Nazi Germany in Munich. Chicago years (1937‚Äì1946) Papmac (1943) In 1937, on the recommendation of Walter Gropius, and at the invitation of Walter Paepcke, the Chairman of the Container Corporation of America, Moholy-Nagy moved to Chicago to become the director of the New Bauhaus. The philosophy of the school was basically unchanged from that of the original, and its headquarters was the Prairie Avenue mansion that architect Richard Morris Hunt had designed for department store magnate Marshall Field. However, the school lost the financial backing of its supporters after only a single academic year, and it closed in 1938. Moholy-Nagy resumed doing commercial design work, which he continued to do for the rest of his life. Moholy-Nagy was also the Art Advisor for the mail-order house of Spiegel in Chicago. Paepcke continued to support the artist, and in 1939 Moholy-Nagy opened the School of Design in Chicago. He also started making static and mobile sculptures in transparent plastic, often accented with chromed metal. In 1940, the summer session of the School of Design was held at Mills College in Oakland, California. In 1942, he taught a summer course at the Women's Teachers College in Denton, Texas. In 1943, Moholy-Nagy began work on an account of his efforts to develop the curriculum of the School of Design. It would be posthumously published in his 1947 book Vision in Motion, in collaboration with his art historian wife Sibyl. In 1944, the School of Design in Chicago became the Institute of Design, and in 1949 it would become a part of Illinois Institute of Technology, the first institution in the United States to offer a PhD in design. Moholy-Nagy was diagnosed with leukemia in 1945. He became a naturalized American citizen in April 1946. He continued to produce artworks in multiple media, to teach, and to attend conferences until he died of the disease in Chicago on November 24, 1946. Legacy Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest is named in his honor. The software company Laszlo Systems (developers of the open source programming language OpenLaszlo) was named in part to honor Moholy-Nagy. In 1998 a Tribute Marker from the City of Chicago was installed. In the autumn of 2003, the Moholy-Nagy Foundation, Inc. was established as a source of information about Moholy- Nagy's life and works. In 2016, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York exhibited a retrospective of Moholy-Nagy's work that included painting, film, photography, and sculpture.

He is formerly a professor of economics and law at George Mason University, and a board member of the Mercatus Center. He was also a founding board member of the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University. Smith shared the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Daniel Kahneman for his contributions to Behavioral Economics. Smith is the founder and president of the International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics, a Member of the Board of Advisors for The Independent Institute, a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington D.C.. In 2004 Smith was honored with an honorary doctoral degree at Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n, the institution that named the Vernon Smith Center for Experimental Economics Research after him. Education Smith was born in Wichita, Kansas, where he attended Wichita North High School and Friends University. He received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Caltech in 1949, an M.A. in economics from the University of Kansas in 1952, and his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1955. Academic career Smith's first teaching post was at the Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, which he held from 1955 until 1967, attaining the rank of full professor. Smith also taught as a visiting associate professor at Stanford University (1961‚Äì1962) and there made contact with Sidney Siegel, who was also doing work in experimental economics. Smith moved with his family to Massachusetts and got a position first at Brown University (1967‚Äì1968) and then at the University of Massachusetts (1968‚Äì1972). Smith also received appointments at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1972‚Äì1973) and Caltech (1973‚Äì1975). Much of the research that earned Smith the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was conducted at the University of Arizona between 1976 and 2001. In 2001, Smith left Arizona for George Mason University. From 2003 to 2006, he held the Rasmuson Chair of Economics at the University of Alaska Anchorage. In 2008, Smith founded the Economic Science Institute at Chapman University in Orange, California. Smith has served on the board of editors of the American Economic Review, The Cato Journal, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, Science, Economic Theory, Economic Design, and the Journal of Economic Methodology. He also served as an expert for the Copenhagen Consensus. Academic work It was at Purdue that Smith's work in experimental economics began. As Smith describes it: In framing the experiment, Smith varied certain institutional parameters seen in the first classroom economics experiments as conducted by Edward Chamberlin: in particular, he ran the experiments for several trading periods, to give the student subjects time to train. At Caltech, Charles Plott encouraged Smith to formalize the methodology of experimental economics, which he did in two articles. In 1976, \\"Experimental Economics: Induced Value Theory\\" was published in the American Economic Review (AER).Smith 1976 It was the first articulation of the principle behind economic experiments. Six years later, these principles were expanded in \\"Microeconomic Systems as an Experimental Science,\\" also in the AER. This paper adapts the principles of mechanism design, a microeconomic system developed by Leonid Hurwicz, to the development of economic experiments. In Hurwicz's formulation, a microeconomic system consists of an economic environment, an economic institution (or economic mechanism), and an economic outcome. The economic environment is simply the preferences of the people in the economy and the production capabilities of the firms in the economy. The key insight in this formulation is that the economic outcome can be affected by the economic institution. The mechanism design provides a formal means for tests of the performance of an economic institution, and experimental economics, as developed by Smith, provided a means for formal empirical assessment of the performance of economic institutions. The second main contribution of the paper is to the technique of induced values, the method used in controlled laboratory experiments in economics, political science, and psychology, which allows experimental economists to create a replica of a market in a laboratory. Subjects in an experiment are told that they can produce a \\"commodity\\" at a cost and then sell it to buyers. The seller earns the difference between the price received and its cost. Buyers are told that the commodity has a value to them when they consume it, and they earn the difference between the value of the commodity to them and its price. Using the technique, Smith and his coauthors have examined the performance of alternative trading mechanisms in resource allocation.Smith 1982 In February 2011, Smith participated in the \\"Visiting Scholars Series\\" at the Nicholas Academic Centers in Santa Ana, California, conducted in collaboration with Chapman University. Smith and his colleague Bart Wilson conducted experiments designed to expose high school students from underserved neighborhoods to market dynamics and how concepts such as altruism influence economic behavior. Smith has authored or coauthored articles and books on capital theory, finance, natural resource economics and experimental economics. He was also one of the first to propose the combinatorial auction design, with Stephen J. Rassenti and Robert L. Bulfin in 1982.Rassenti, Smith, and Bulfin 1982 In January 2009, Smith signed a public petition opposing the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In a 2010 Econ Journal Watch study, Smith was found to be one of the most active petition-signers among US economists.Hedengren, David, Daniel B. Klein, and Carrie Milton. \\"Economist Petitions: Ideology Revealed\\", Econ Journal Watch 7[3]: 288‚Äì319, Sept 2010. The Vernon Smith Prize for the Advancement of Austrian Economics is named after him and is sponsored by the European Center of Austrian Economics.

The concept of active-matrix LCDs was proposed by Bernard J. Lechner at the RCA Laboratories in 1968. The first functional AMLCD with thin- film transistors was made by T. Peter Brody, Fang-Chen Luo and their team at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1972. However, it took years of additional research and development by others to launch successful products. Introduction The most common type of AMLCD contains, besides the polarizing sheets and cells of liquid crystal, a matrix of thin-film transistors to make a thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display. These devices store the electrical state of each pixel on the display while all the other pixels are being updated. This method provides a much brighter, sharper display than a passive matrix of the same size. An important specification for these displays is their viewing-angle. Thin-film transistors are usually used for constructing an active matrix so that the two terms are often interchanged, even though a thin-film transistor is just one component in an active matrix and some active-matrix designs have used other components such as diodes. Whereas a passive matrix display uses a simple conductive grid to apply a voltage to the liquid crystals in the target area, an active-matrix display uses a grid of transistors and capacitors with the ability to hold a charge for a limited period of time. Because of the switching action of transistors, only the desired pixel receives a charge, and the pixel acts as a capacitor to hold the charge until the next refresh cycle, improving image quality over a passive matrix. This is a special version of a sample-and-hold circuit.

He is best remembered for his contributions to mathematics, his membership in the Scriblerus Club (where he inspired both Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels book III and Alexander Pope's Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry, Memoirs of Martin Scriblerus, and possibly The Dunciad), and for inventing the figure of John Bull. Biography In his mid-life, Arbuthnot, complaining of the work of Edmund Curll, among others, who commissioned and invented a biography as soon as an author died, said, \\"Biography is one of the new terrors of death,\\" and so a biography of Arbuthnot is made difficult by his own reluctance to leave records. Alexander Pope noted to Joseph Spence that Arbuthnot allowed his infant children to play with, and even burn, his writings. Throughout his professional life, Arbuthnot exhibited a strong humility and conviviality, and his friends complained that he did not take credit for his own work. Arbuthnot was born in Arbuthnot, Kincardineshire, on the north-eastern coast of Scotland, son of Rev Alexander Arbuthnot, an Episcopalian priest and Margaret, n√©e Lammie. He may have graduated with an arts degree from Marischal College in 1685. Where John's brothers took part in Jacobite causes in 1689, he remained with his father. These brothers included Robert, who fled after fighting for King James VII in 1689 and became a banker in Rouen and half- brother George, who fled to France and became a wine merchant. However, when William and Mary came to the throne and the Scottish and English parliaments required all ministers to swear allegiance to them as king and queen, Arbuthnot's father did not comply. As a non-juror, he was removed from his church, and John was there to take care of affairs when, in 1691, his father died. Arbuthnot, from a painting by Godfrey Knoeller Arbuthnot went to London in 1691, where he is supposed to have supported himself by teaching mathematics (which had been his formal course of study). He lodged with William Pate, whom Swift knew and called a \\"bel esprit\\". He published Of the Laws of Chance in 1692, translated from Christiaan Huygens's De ratiociniis in ludo aleae. This was the first work on probability published in English. The work, which applied the field of probability to common games, was a success, and Arbuthnot became the private tutor of one Edward Jeffreys, son of Jeffrey Jeffreys, an MP. He remained Jeffreys's tutor when the latter attended University College, Oxford in 1694, and he there met the variety of scholars then teaching mathematics and medicine, including Dr John Radcliffe, Isaac Newton, and Samuel Pepys. However, Arbuthnot lacked the money to be a full- time student and was already well educated, although informally. He went to the University of St Andrews and enrolled as a doctoral student in medicine on 11 September 1696. The very same day he defended seven theses on medicine and was awarded the doctorate. He first wrote satire in 1697, when he answered Dr John Woodward's An essay towards a natural history of the earth and terrestrial bodies, especially minerals... with An Examination of Dr Woodward's Account &c.; He poked fun at the arrogance of the work and Woodward's misguided, Aristotelian insistence that what is theoretically attractive must be actually true. In 1701, Arbuthnot wrote another mathematical work, An essay on the usefulness of mathematical learning, in a letter from a gentleman in the city to his friend in Oxford. The work was moderately successful, and Arbuthnot praises mathematics as a method of freeing the mind from superstition. In 1702, he was at Epsom when Prince George of Denmark, husband of Queen Anne fell ill. According to tradition, Arbuthnot treated the prince successfully. According to tradition again, this treatment earned him an invitation to court. Also around 1702, he married Margaret, whose maiden name is possibly Wemyss. Although there are no baptismal records, it seems that his first son, George (named in honour of the prince), was born in 1703. He was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1704. Also thanks to the Queen's presence, he was made an MD at Cambridge University on 16 April 1705. Arbuthnot was an amiable individual, and Swift said that the only fault an enemy could lay upon him was a slight waddle in his walk. His conviviality and his royal connections made him an important figure in the Royal Society. In 1705, Arbuthnot became physician extraordinary to Queen Anne, and at the same time was put on the board trying to publish the Historia coelestius. Newton and Edmund Halley wanted it published immediately, to support their work on orbits, while John Flamsteed, the Royal Astronomer whose observations they were, wanted to keep the data secret until he had perfected it. The result was that Arbuthnot used his leverage as friend and physician to Prince George, whose money was paying for the publication, to force Flamsteed to allow it out, albeit with serious errors, in 1712. Also as a scholar, Arbuthnot took up an interest in antiquities and published Tables of Grecian, Roman, and Jewish measures, weights and coins; reduced to the English standard in 1705, 1707, 1709, and, expanded with a preface (which indicated that his second son, Charles, was born in 1705), in 1727 and 1747. Although Arbuthnot was not a Jacobite after the fashion of his brothers, he was a Tory, for national and familial reasons. Anne was advised (and many said controlled) by Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, who was a champion of Whig causes. In 1706, the Duchess of Marlborough fell out with Anne‚Äîa schism which the Tories were pleased to encourage. The marriage of lady-in-waiting Abigail Hill to Samuel Masham, which was the first overt sign of Anne's displeasure with Sarah Churchill, took place in Arbuthnot's apartments at St. James's Palace. The reasons for the choice of apartment and the degree of involvement of Arbuthnot in either the love match or Anne's estrangement, are not clear. As a Scotsman, Arbuthnot served the crown by writing A sermon preach'd to the people at the Mercat Cross of Edinborough on the subject of the union. Ecclesiastes, Chapter 10, Verse 27. The work was designed to persuade Scots to accept the Act of Union. When the Act passed, Arbuthnot was made a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He was also made a physician in ordinary to the Queen, which made him part of the royal household. Arbuthnot returned to mathematics in 1710 with An argument for Divine Providence, taken from the constant regularity observed in the births of both sexes (linked below) in the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions. In this paper, Arbuthnot examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710 and the human sex ratio at birth: in every year, the number of males born in London exceeded the number of females. If the probability of male and female birth were equal, the probability of the observed outcome would be 1/282, a vanishingly small number. This is vanishingly small, leading Arbuthnot that this was not due to chance, but to divine providence: \\"From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs.\\" This paper was a landmark in the history of statistics; in modern terms he performed statistical hypothesis testing, computing the p-value (via a sign test), interpreted it as statistical significance, and rejected the null hypothesis. This is credited as \\"‚Ä¶ the first use of significance tests ‚Ä¶\\", the first example of reasoning about statistical significance and moral certainty, and \\"‚Ä¶ perhaps the first published report of a nonparametric test ‚Ä¶\\". As a Scriblerian In 1710, Jonathan Swift moved to London. With Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (who was then the secretary of the treasury and not a peer), he produced the Tory Examiner, and Arbuthnot made their acquaintance and began to provide \\"hints\\" to them. These \\"hints\\" were ideas for essays, satirical gambits, and facts, rather than secrets of any sort. From 1711 to 1713, Arbuthnot and Swift formed \\"The Brothers' Club,\\" though Arbuthnot characteristically gave away his ideas and even his writings, never seeking credit for them. John Bull in his World War I iteration. Arbuthnot's character became an enduring symbol for the United Kingdom. In 1712, Arbuthnot and Swift both attempted to aid the Tory government of Harley and Henry St. John in their efforts to end the War of the Spanish Succession. The war had profited John and Sarah Churchill, and the Tory ministry sought to end it by withdrawing from all England's alliances and negotiating directly with France. Swift wrote The Conduct of the Allies, and Arbuthnot wrote a series of five pamphlets featuring John Bull. The first of these, Law Is a Bottomless Pit (1712), introduced a simple allegory to explain the war. John Bull (England) is suing Louis Baboon (i.e. Louis Bourbon, or Louis XIV of France) over the estate of the dead Lord Strutt (Charles II of Spain). Bull's lawyer is the one who really enjoys the suit, and he is Humphrey Hocus (Marlborough). Bull has a sister named Peg (Scotland). The pamphlets are Swiftian in their satire, in that they make all of the characters hopelessly flawed and comic and none of their endeavour worth pursuing (which was Arbuthnot's intent, as he sought to make the war an object of scorn), but it is filled with homespun humour, a common touch, and a sympathy for the figures that is distinctly non-Swiftian. In 1713, Arbuthnot continued his political satire with Proposals for printing a very curious discourse... a treatise of the art of political lying, with an abstract of the first volume. As with other works that Arbuthnot encouraged, this systemizes a rhetoric of bad thinking and writing. He proposes to teach people to lie well. Similar lists and systems are in Alexander Pope's Peri Bathos and John Gay and Pope's Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus. Also in 1713, Arbuthnot was made a physician of Chelsea Hospital, which provided him with a house. It was this house that hosted the meetings of the Scriblerus Club, which had as its members Harley (now Earl of Oxford), St. John (now Viscount Bolingbroke), Pope, Gay, Swift, and Thomas Parnell. According to all the members of the Club, Arbuthnot was the one who contributed the most in ideas, and he was the only source they could draw upon when satirizing the sciences, and his was the idea for the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, a pedantic man who, like Arbuthnot's earlier opponent, Dr Woodward, would read three or four lines of Classical literature and deduce a universal (and absurd) truth from them. The Club met for only a year, for Anne died in July 1714, and the Club met for the last time in November of that year. When Anne died, she had no will. Consequently, all her servants were left without positions and entirely at the mercy of the next administration ‚Äî an administration that was chosen by the enemies of Arbuthnot and the other Scriblerans. When George I came to the throne, Arbuthnot lost all of his royal appointments and houses, but he still had a vigorous medical practice. He lived at \\"the second door from the left in Dover Street\\" in Piccadilly. Life under the Hanoverians In 1717, Arbuthnot contributed somewhat to Pope and Gay's play, Three Hours after Marriage, which ran for seven nights. He was a friend to George Frederic Handel and appointed director to the Royal Academy of Music (1719) from the start in 1719 till 1729. In 1719 he took part in a pamphlet war over the treatment of smallpox. In particular, he attacked Dr Woodward, who had again presented a dogmatic and, Arbuthnot thought, irrational opinion. In 1723, Arbuthnot was made one of the censors of the Royal College of Physicians, and as such he was one of the campaigners to inspect and improve the drugs sold by apothecaries in London. In 1723, the apothecaries sued the RCP, and Arbuthnot wrote Reasons humbly offered by the ... upholders (undertakers) against part of the bill for the better viewing, searching, and examining of drugs. The pamphlet suggested that the funeral directors of London might wish to sue the Royal College of Physicians as well to ensure that drug safety remained poor. In 1727, he was made an elect of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1726 and 1727, Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope reunited at Arbuthnot's house during visits, and Swift showed Arbuthnot the manuscript of Gulliver's Travels ahead of time. The detailed parody of on-going Royal Society projects in book III of Gulliver's Travels likely came from \\"hints\\" from Arbuthnot. The visit also bore fruit in Pope's The Dunciad of 1729 (the second edition), where Arbuthnot probably wrote the \\"Virgilius restauratus\\" satirizing Richard Bentley. Arbuthnot was guardian to Peter the Wild Boy on his first arrival in London. Illustration from Tentamen circa indolem alimentoru published in Acta Eruditorum, 1734 In 1730, Arbuthnot's wife died. The next year, he produced a work of popular medicine, An essay concerning the nature of aliments, and the choice of them, according to the different constitutions of human bodies. The book was quite popular, and a second edition, with advice on diet, came out the next year. It had four more full editions and translations into French and German. In 1733 he wrote another very popular work of medicine called An Essay Concerning the Effects of Air on Human Bodies. As with the former work, it went through multiple editions and translations. He argued that the air itself had to have enormous effects on the personality and persons of humanity, and he believed that the air of locations resulted in the characteristics of the people, as well as particular maladies. He advised his readers to ventilate sickrooms and to seek fresh air in cities. Although the idea that airs carried sickness was incorrect, the practical upshot of Arbuthnot's advice was efficacious, as crowded, poorly sanitized Augustan era cities had bad air and infectious air. His son Charles, studying to be a divine at Christ Church, Oxford, died in 1731, the same year that the Swift and Pope Miscellanies, Volume the Third (which was the first volume) appeared. He contributed \\"An Essay of the Learned Martinus Scriblerus Concerning the Origine of the Sciences\\" to the volume. In 1734, his health began to decline. He had kidney stones and asthma, and he was also overweight. On 17 July 1734, Arbuthnot wrote to Pope to tell him that he had a terminal illness. In a response dated 2 August, Pope indicates that he planned to write more satire, and on 25 August told Arbuthnot that he was going to address one of his epistles to him, later characterizing it as a memorial to their friendship. Arbuthnot died at his house in Cork Street, in London on 27 February 1735, eight weeks after the poem \\"Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot\\" was published.Rogers, The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia, p. 110; Baines, The Complete Critical Guide to Alexander Pope (Routledge, 2000), p. 37. He is buried at St James's Church, Piccadilly. Literary significance Arbuthnot was one of the founding members of the Scriblerus Club, and was regarded by the other wits of the group as the funniest, but he left fewer literary remains than the other members. His satires are written with an ease, a humanity, and an apparent sympathy. Swift and Arbuthnot had similar styles in language (both preferred direct sentences and clear vocabulary) with a feigned frenzy of lists and taxonomies, and sometimes their works are attributed to each other. The treatise on political lying, for example, has been attributed to Swift in the past, although it was definitely Arbuthnot's. Generally, Arbuthnot's writings are not as vicious or nihilistic as Swift's, but they attack the same targets and both refuse to hold up a set of positive norms for their readers. Because of Arbuthnot's own insistence on not being recognized, it is difficult to speak definitively of his literary significance. Dr. Johnson describes him as the 'most universal genius''Life and Works', ed G.A. Aitken 1892 and we know that he was at the heart of many of the greatest satires of his age. He was a conduit and source for a great many of the finest literary accomplishments for over half a century of writing, but Arbuthnot was zealous that he not receive credit.

The original experiment was designed to measure the radiation produced when an extra block was added. The mass went supercritical when the block was placed improperly by being dropped. A critical mass is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. The critical mass of a fissionable material depends upon its nuclear properties (specifically, its nuclear fission cross-section), density, shape, enrichment, purity, temperature, and surroundings. The concept is important in nuclear weapon design.  Explanation of criticality When a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining, the mass is said to be in a critical state in which there is no increase or decrease in power, temperature, or neutron population. A numerical measure of a critical mass is dependent on the effective neutron multiplication factor , the average number of neutrons released per fission event that go on to cause another fission event rather than being absorbed or leaving the material. When k = 1, the mass is critical, and the chain reaction is self-sustaining. A subcritical mass is a mass of fissile material that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction. A population of neutrons introduced to a subcritical assembly will exponentially decrease. In this case, k < 1\\\\. A steady rate of spontaneous fissions causes a proportionally steady level of neutron activity. The constant of proportionality increases as increases. A supercritical mass is one in which, once fission has started, it will proceed at an increasing rate. The material may settle into equilibrium (i.e. become critical again) at an elevated temperature/power level or destroy itself. In the case of supercriticality, k > 1. Due to spontaneous fission a supercritical mass will undergo a chain reaction. For example, a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 (235U) with a mass of about would experience around 15 spontaneous fission events per second. The probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass. If there is uranium-238 (238U) present, the rate of spontaneous fission will be much higher. Fission can also be initiated by neutrons produced by cosmic rays. Changing the point of criticality The mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel, shape, temperature, density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance. These attributes have complex interactions and interdependencies. These examples only outline the simplest ideal cases: =Varying the amount of fuel= It is possible for a fuel assembly to be critical at near zero power. If the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass to create an \\"exactly critical mass\\", fission would be self-sustaining for only one neutron generation (fuel consumption then makes the assembly subcritical again). If the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass, to create a barely supercritical mass, the temperature of the assembly would increase to an initial maximum (for example: 1 K above the ambient temperature) and then decrease back to the ambient temperature after a period of time, because fuel consumed during fission brings the assembly back to subcriticality once again. =Changing the shape= A mass may be exactly critical without being a perfect homogeneous sphere. More closely refining the shape toward a perfect sphere will make the mass supercritical. Conversely changing the shape to a less perfect sphere will decrease its reactivity and make it subcritical. =Changing the temperature= A mass may be exactly critical at a particular temperature. Fission and absorption cross-sections increase as the relative neutron velocity decreases. As fuel temperature increases, neutrons of a given energy appear faster and thus fission/absorption is less likely. This is not unrelated to Doppler broadening of the 238U resonances but is common to all fuels/absorbers/configurations. Neglecting the very important resonances, the total neutron cross-section of every material exhibits an inverse relationship with relative neutron velocity. Hot fuel is always less reactive than cold fuel (over/under moderation in LWR is a different topic). Thermal expansion associated with temperature increase also contributes a negative coefficient of reactivity since fuel atoms are moving farther apart. A mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone. =Varying the density of the mass= The higher the density, the lower the critical mass. The density of a material at a constant temperature can be changed by varying the pressure or tension or by changing crystal structure (see allotropes of plutonium). An ideal mass will become subcritical if allowed to expand or conversely the same mass will become supercritical if compressed. Changing the temperature may also change the density; however, the effect on critical mass is then complicated by temperature effects (see \\"Changing the temperature\\") and by whether the material expands or contracts with increased temperature. Assuming the material expands with temperature (enriched uranium-235 at room temperature for example), at an exactly critical state, it will become subcritical if warmed to lower density or become supercritical if cooled to higher density. Such a material is said to have a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity to indicate that its reactivity decreases when its temperature increases. Using such a material as fuel means fission decreases as the fuel temperature increases. =Use of a neutron reflector= Surrounding a spherical critical mass with a neutron reflector further reduces the mass needed for criticality. A common material for a neutron reflector is beryllium metal. This reduces the number of neutrons which escape the fissile material, resulting in increased reactivity. =Use of a tamper= In a bomb, a dense shell of material surrounding the fissile core will contain, via inertia, the expanding fissioning material. This increases the efficiency. A tamper also tends to act as a neutron reflector. Because a bomb relies on fast neutrons (not ones moderated by reflection with light elements, as in a reactor), the neutrons reflected by a tamper are slowed by their collisions with the tamper nuclei, and because it takes time for the reflected neutrons to return to the fissile core, they take rather longer to be absorbed by a fissile nucleus. But they do contribute to the reaction, and can decrease the critical mass by a factor of four.Serber, Robert, The Los Alamos Primer: The First Lectures on How to Build an Atomic Bomb, (University of California Press, 1992) Original 1943 \\"LA-1\\", declassified in 1965, plus commentary and historical introduction Also, if the tamper is (e.g. depleted) uranium, it can fission due to the high energy neutrons generated by the primary explosion. This can greatly increase yield, especially if even more neutrons are generated by fusing hydrogen isotopes, in a so-called boosted configuration. Critical size The critical size is the minimum size of a nuclear reactor core or nuclear weapon that can be made for a specific geometrical arrangement and material composition. The critical size must at least include enough fissionable material to reach critical mass. If the size of the reactor core is less than a certain minimum, too many fission neutrons escape through its surface and the chain reaction is not sustained. Critical mass of a bare sphere Top: A sphere of fissile material is too small to allow the chain reaction to become self-sustaining as neutrons generated by fissions can too easily escape. Middle: By increasing the mass of the sphere to a critical mass, the reaction can become self-sustaining. Bottom: Surrounding the original sphere with a neutron reflector increases the efficiency of the reactions and also allows the reaction to become self- sustaining. The shape with minimal critical mass and the smallest physical dimensions is a sphere. Bare-sphere critical masses at normal density of some actinides are listed in the following table. Most information on bare sphere masses is considered classified, since it is critical to nuclear weapons design, but some documents have been declassified.Reevaluated Critical Specifications of Some Los Alamos Fast-Neutron Systems The critical mass for lower-grade uranium depends strongly on the grade: with 20% 235U it is over 400 kg; with 15% 235U, it is well over 600 kg. The critical mass is inversely proportional to the square of the density. If the density is 1% more and the mass 2% less, then the volume is 3% less and the diameter 1% less. The probability for a neutron per cm travelled to hit a nucleus is proportional to the density. It follows that 1% greater density means that the distance travelled before leaving the system is 1% less. This is something that must be taken into consideration when attempting more precise estimates of critical masses of plutonium isotopes than the approximate values given above, because plutonium metal has a large number of different crystal phases which can have widely varying densities. Note that not all neutrons contribute to the chain reaction. Some escape and others undergo radiative capture. Let q denote the probability that a given neutron induces fission in a nucleus. Consider only prompt neutrons, and let ŒΩ denote the number of prompt neutrons generated in a nuclear fission. For example, ŒΩ ‚âà 2.5 for uranium-235. Then, criticality occurs when ŒΩ¬∑q = 1. The dependence of this upon geometry, mass, and density appears through the factor q. Given a total interaction cross section œÉ (typically measured in barns), the mean free path of a prompt neutron is \\\\ell^{-1} = n \\\\sigma where n is the nuclear number density. Most interactions are scattering events, so that a given neutron obeys a random walk until it either escapes from the medium or causes a fission reaction. So long as other loss mechanisms are not significant, then, the radius of a spherical critical mass is rather roughly given by the product of the mean free path \\\\ell and the square root of one plus the number of scattering events per fission event (call this s), since the net distance travelled in a random walk is proportional to the square root of the number of steps: R_c \\\\simeq \\\\ell \\\\sqrt{s} \\\\simeq \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{s}}{n \\\\sigma} Note again, however, that this is only a rough estimate. In terms of the total mass M, the nuclear mass m, the density œÅ, and a fudge factor f which takes into account geometrical and other effects, criticality corresponds to 1 = \\\\frac{f \\\\sigma}{m \\\\sqrt{s}} \\\\rho^{2/3} M^{1/3} which clearly recovers the aforementioned result that critical mass depends inversely on the square of the density. Alternatively, one may restate this more succinctly in terms of the areal density of mass, Œ£: 1 = \\\\frac{f' \\\\sigma}{m \\\\sqrt{s}} \\\\Sigma where the factor f has been rewritten as f' to account for the fact that the two values may differ depending upon geometrical effects and how one defines Œ£. For example, for a bare solid sphere of 239Pu criticality is at 320 kg/m2, regardless of density, and for 235U at 550 kg/m2. In any case, criticality then depends upon a typical neutron \\"seeing\\" an amount of nuclei around it such that the areal density of nuclei exceeds a certain threshold. This is applied in implosion-type nuclear weapons where a spherical mass of fissile material that is substantially less than a critical mass is made supercritical by very rapidly increasing œÅ (and thus Œ£ as well) (see below). Indeed, sophisticated nuclear weapons programs can make a functional device from less material than more primitive weapons programs require. Aside from the math, there is a simple physical analog that helps explain this result. Consider diesel fumes belched from an exhaust pipe. Initially the fumes appear black, then gradually you are able to see through them without any trouble. This is not because the total scattering cross section of all the soot particles has changed, but because the soot has dispersed. If we consider a transparent cube of length L on a side, filled with soot, then the optical depth of this medium is inversely proportional to the square of L, and therefore proportional to the areal density of soot particles: we can make it easier to see through the imaginary cube just by making the cube larger. Several uncertainties contribute to the determination of a precise value for critical masses, including (1) detailed knowledge of fission cross sections, (2) calculation of geometric effects. This latter problem provided significant motivation for the development of the Monte Carlo method in computational physics by Nicholas Metropolis and Stanislaw Ulam. In fact, even for a homogeneous solid sphere, the exact calculation is by no means trivial. Finally, note that the calculation can also be performed by assuming a continuum approximation for the neutron transport. This reduces it to a diffusion problem. However, as the typical linear dimensions are not significantly larger than the mean free path, such an approximation is only marginally applicable. Finally, note that for some idealized geometries, the critical mass might formally be infinite, and other parameters are used to describe criticality. For example, consider an infinite sheet of fissionable material. For any finite thickness, this corresponds to an infinite mass. However, criticality is only achieved once the thickness of this slab exceeds a critical value. Criticality in nuclear weapon design fizzle) can occur, whereby a very small explosion will blow the bulk of the material apart. Until detonation is desired, a nuclear weapon must be kept subcritical. In the case of a uranium bomb, this can be achieved by keeping the fuel in a number of separate pieces, each below the critical size either because they are too small or unfavorably shaped. To produce detonation, the pieces of uranium are brought together rapidly. In Little Boy, this was achieved by firing a piece of uranium (a 'doughnut') down a gun barrel onto another piece (a 'spike'). This design is referred to as a gun-type fission weapon. A theoretical 100% pure 239Pu weapon could also be constructed as a gun-type weapon, like the Manhattan Project's proposed Thin Man design. In reality, this is impractical because even \\"weapons grade\\" 239Pu is contaminated with a small amount of 240Pu, which has a strong propensity toward spontaneous fission. Because of this, a reasonably sized gun-type weapon would suffer nuclear reaction (predetonation) before the masses of plutonium would be in a position for a full-fledged explosion to occur. Instead, the plutonium is present as a subcritical sphere (or other shape), which may or may not be hollow. Detonation is produced by exploding a shaped charge surrounding the sphere, increasing the density (and collapsing the cavity, if present) to produce a prompt critical configuration. This is known as an implosion type weapon. Prompt criticality The event of fission must release, on the average, more than one free neutron of the desired energy level in order to sustain a chain reaction, and each must find other nuclei and cause them to fission. Most of the neutrons released from a fission event come immediately from that event, but a fraction of them come later, when the fission products decay, which may be on the average from microseconds to minutes later. This is fortunate for atomic power generation, for without this delay \\"going critical\\" would be an immediately catastrophic event, as it is in a nuclear bomb where upwards of 80 generations of chain reaction occur in less than a microsecond, far too fast for a human, or even a machine, to react. Physicists recognize two points in the gradual increase of neutron flux which are significant: critical, where the chain reaction becomes self-sustaining thanks to the contributions of both kinds of neutron generation,In the description of the Soviet equivalent of the CP1 startup at the University of Chicago in 1942, the long waits for those tardy neutrons is described in detail and prompt critical, where the immediate \\"prompt\\" neutrons alone will sustain the reaction without need for the decay neutrons. Nuclear power plants operate between these two points of reactivity, while above the prompt critical point is the domain of nuclear weapons and some nuclear power accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. A convenient unit for the measurement of the reactivity is that suggested by Louis Slotin: that of the dollar and cents.

On 8 March 1876 he was elected president of the Chamber of Deputies, a post which he filled with such efficiency that upon the resignation of Marshal MacMahon he seemed to step naturally into the Presidency of the Republic (30 January 1879), and was elected without opposition by the republican parties. =Resignation= Quiet, shrewd, attentive to the public interest and his own, but without any particular distinction, he would have left an unblemished reputation if he had not accepted a second term (18 December 1885).

In 1825 he was ordained priest, and was appointed vicar of the Madeleine at Paris. For a time he was tutor to the Orl√©ans princes. He became the founder of a celebrated academy at St Hyacinthe, and received a letter from Gregory XVI lauding his work there, and calling him Apostolus juventutis. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1854,King, Edward (1876). \\"Monseigneur Dupanloup,\\" in French Political Leaders. New York: G. P.

His imposing height, his noble features, his brilliant eloquence, as well as his renown for zeal and charity, made him a prominent feature in French life for many years. Crowds of persons attended his addresses, on whom his energy, command of language, powerful voice and impassioned gestures made a profound impression. When made bishop of Orl√©ans in 1849, he pronounced a fervid panegyric on Joan of Arc, which attracted attention in England as well as France. Joan of Arc was later canonized, due partly to Dupanloup's efforts. Before this, he had been sent by Archbishop Aifre to Rome, and had been appointed Roman prelate and protonotary apostolic. For thirty years he remained a notable figure in France, doing his utmost to arouse his countrymen from religious indifference. He was a distinguished educationist who fought for the retention of the Latin classics in the schools and instituted the celebrated catechetical method of St Sulpice. Among his publications are De l'√âducation (1850), De la Haute √âducation Intellectuelle (3 vols., 1866), ≈íuvres Choisies (1861, 4 vols.); Histoire de J√©sus (1872), a counterblast to Renan's Vie de J√©sus.

Dupanloup died on 11 October 1878 at the ch√¢teau of La Combe-de-Lancey. Memory In the work known as Illustrissimi, a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice, Dupanloup is one of the \\"recipients\\" of the letters. There are 40 letters in all, mainly to people in Italian history and fiction, but also to internationally well known fictional and historical characters such as Pinocchio, Charles Dickens, Hippocrates, and Jesus. Each of the letters tend to be droll and witty, but cleverly turned into a short sermon in order to make a point, whether it is on fashion, pornography, capitalism, or the communications industry. In his book My Life and Loves, volume III, chapter 15, Frank Harris tells of an anecdote he told Prince Edward, The Prince of Wales, about the bishop: \\"There is a story told,\\" I said, \\"of Monseigneur Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans, who was supposed to be one of the wittiest men of his time. He was at dinner once with a lady who made a peculiar little noise and then proceeded to shuffle with her feet on the parquet so as to cover the indiscretion with similar sounds. 'Oh, Madame,' said the witty Bishop, 'please don't trouble to find a rhyme; it is not important.'\\" The Prince laughed but did not prize the witty word at its real worth.  Works  Mgr.

Cockburn-Hood, The House of Cockburn of That Ilk and the Cadets Thereof‚Ä¶ (Edinburgh, 1888), p. 152. was a Scottish lawyer, judge and literary figure. He served as Solicitor General for Scotland between 1830 and 1834. Background and Education His mother Janet Rannie was connected by marriage with the influential Lord Melville, and his father, Archibald Cockburn, was Sheriff of Midlothian and Baron of the Court of Exchequer. He was educated at the Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh. His brother, John Cockburn FRSE (died 1862), was a wine merchant and founder of Cockburn's of Leith. Literary career Cockburn contributed regularly to the Edinburgh Review. In this popular magazine of its day he is described as: \\"rather below the middle height, firm, wiry and muscular, inured to active exercise of all kinds, a good swimmer, an accomplished skater, an intense lover of the fresh breezes of heaven. He was the model of a high-bred Scotch gentleman. He spoke with a Doric breadth of accent. Cockburn was one of the most popular men north of the Tweed.\\"Monuments and Statues of Edinburgh, Michael T.R.B. Turnbull (Chambers)p. 53 He was a member of the famous Speculative Society, to which Sir Walter Scott, Henry Brougham and Francis Jeffrey belonged. The extent of Cockburn's literary ability only became known after he had passed his 70th year, on the publication of his biography of lifelong friend Lord Jeffrey in 1852, and from his chief literary work, the Memorials of his Time, which appeared posthumously in 1856. His published work continued with his Journal, published in 1874. These constitute an autobiography of the writer interspersed with notices of manners, public events, and sketches of his contemporaries, of great interest and value. Legal and judicial career Statue of Lord Cockburn by William Brodie 14 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, the town house of Lord Cockburn Cockburn entered the Faculty of Advocates in 1800, and attached himself, not to the party of his relatives, who could have afforded him most valuable patronage, but to the Whig party, and that at a time when it held out few inducements to men ambitious of success in life. He became a distinguished advocate, and ultimately a judge. He was one of the leaders of the Whig party in Scotland in its days of darkness prior to the Reform Act of 1832, and was a close friend of Sir Thomas Dick Lauder. He was the defence lawyer for Helen McDougal, Burke's wife, in the trial for the Burke and Hare murders, and won her acquittal. On the accession of Earl Grey's ministry in 1830 he became Solicitor General for Scotland. During his time here he drafted the First Scottish Reform Bill. In 1834 he was raised to the bench, and on taking his seat as a Judge in the Court of Session he adopted the title of Lord Cockburn as a Scottish Lord of Session.Peter Beauclerk Dewar, editor, Burkes Landed Gentry of Great Britain ‚Äì The Kingdom in Scotland, 19th ed. ‚Äì volume 1 (Wilmington, Delaware, USA: Burke's Peerage and Gentry LLC, 2001), volume 1, page 884.

A statue of him by local sculptor William Brodie stands in the north-east corner of Parliament Hall. Cockburn Street, built in the 1850s to connect the High Street with the North British Railway's Waverley station, is also named after him. The building at the foot of the street, formerly the \\"Cockburn Hotel\\", bears his image in profile in a stone above the entrance. Cockburn depicted on a building in Cockburn Street, Edinburgh Cockburn had an interest in architectural conservation, particularly in Edinburgh, where several important historic buildings such as John Knox's House and Tailors' Hall in the Cowgate owe their continued existence to the change in attitude towards conservation which he helped bring about. The Cockburn Association (Edinburgh Civic Trust), founded in 1875, was named in his honour. Cockburn was played by Russell Hunter in Cocky, a one-man play which was effectively a dramatisation of his memoirs, broadcast on BBC Scotland. It ended with his closing speech to the jury in the Burke and Hare trial.

Modern robots (2000-present)  = Medical and surgical = da Vinci Surgical System In the medical field, robots are used to make precise movements that are humanly difficult. Robotic surgery involves the use of less-invasive surgical methods, which are ‚Äúprocedures performed through tiny incisions‚Äù.Robotic surgery. (n.d.). https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/robotic- surgery/about/pac-20394974 Currently, robots use the da Vinci surgical method, which involves the robotic arm (which holds onto surgical instruments) and a camera. The surgeon sits on a console where he controls the robot wirelessly. The feed from the camera is projected on a monitor, allowing the surgeon to see the incisions.About robotic surgery at UCLA. (n.d.). https://www.uclahealth.org/robotic- surgery/what-is-robotic-surgery The system is built to mimic the movement of the surgeon‚Äôs hands and has the ability to filter slight hand tremors. But despite the visual feedback, there is no physical feedback. In other words, as the surgeon applies force on the console, the surgeon won‚Äôt be able to feel how much pressure he or she is applying to the tissue. = Military = The earliest robots used in the military dates back to the 19th Century, where automatic weapons were on the rise due to developments in mass production. The first automated weapons were used in World War I, including radio-controlled, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).Buckley, J. (1998). Warfare and History: Air Power in the Age of Total War. Routledge.McKenna, A. (2016). The Future of Drone Use: Opportunities and Threats from Ethical and Legal Perspectives (B. Custers, Ed.). The Hague, The Netherlands: T.M.C. Asser Press. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-6265-132-6 Since the invention, the technology of ground and aerial robotic weapons continues to develop, it transitioned to become part of modern warfare. In the transition phase of the development, the robots were semi-automatic, being able to be controlled remotely by a human controller. The advancements made in sensors and processors lead to advancements in capabilities of military robots.Singer, P. W. (2009, February 11). Military robots and the laws of war. https://www.brookings.edu/articles/military-robots-and-the-laws-of-war/ Since the mid-20th century, the technology of artificial intelligence (A.I.) began to developSmith, C., McGuire, B., Huang, T., & Yang, G. (2006, December). The history of artificial intelligence. https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/06au/projects/history-ai.pdf and in the 21st century, the technology transferred to warfare, and the weapons that were semi-automatous is developing to become lethal autonomous weapons systems, LAWS for short.Kessel, J. M., Reneau, N., & Chan, M. (2019, December 13). A.I. is making it easier to kill (You). here's how [Video file]. https://www.nytimes.com/video/technology/100000006082083/lethal-autonomous- weapons.html?searchResultPosition=1  Impact  As the weapons are being developed to become fully autonomous, there is an ambiguous line of what is the line that separates an enemy to a civilian. There is currently a debate of whether or not artificial intelligence is able to differentiate these enemies and the question of what is morally and humanely right (for example, a child unknowingly working for the enemies). = Space exploration = Space missions involve sending robots into space in the goal of discovering more of the unknown. The robots used in space exploration have been controlled semi- autonomously. The robots that are sent to space have the ability to maneuver itself, and are self-sustaining. To allow for data collection and a controlled research, the robot is always in communications with scientists and engineers on Earth. For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration‚Äôs (NASA) Curiosity rover, which is part of their Mars exploration program, the communication between the rover and the operators are made possible by ‚Äúan international network of antennas that‚Ä¶permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates on its own axis‚Äù.NASA. (n.d.). Mars curiosity rover. https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/communications/ = Artificial intelligence = Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in robotic control to make it able to process and adapt to its surroundings. It is able to be programmed to do a certain task, for instance, walk up a hill. The technology is relatively new, and is being experimented in several fields, such as the military.  Boston Dynamics' robots  Boston Dynamic‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpot‚Äù is an autonomous robot that uses four sensors and allows the robot to map where it is relative to its surroundings. The navigational method is called simultaneous localization and mapping, or ‚ÄúSLAM‚Äù for short. Spot has several operating modes and depending on the obstacles in front of the robot, it has the ability to override the manual mode of the robot and perform actions successfully. This is similar to other robots made by Boston Dynamics, like the ‚ÄúAtlas‚Äù, which also has similar methods of control. When the ‚ÄúAtlas‚Äù is being controlled, the control software doesn‚Äôt explicitly tell the robot how to move its joints, but rather it employs mathematical models of the underlying physics of the robot‚Äôs body and how it interacts with the environment‚Äù. Instead of inputting data into every single joint of the robot, the engineers programmed the robot as a whole, which makes it more capable to adapt to its environment. The information in this source is dissimilar to other sources, except the second source, because robots vary so much depending on the situation. Guizzo, E. (2019, November 27).

The term \\"Groovebox\\" was originally used by Roland Corporation to refer to its MC-303, released in 1996. The term has since entered general use,Sound on Sound articles on grooveboxes and dates back to the Movement Computer Systems Drum Computer in 1981. A groovebox consists of three integrated elements. * One or more sound sources, such as a drum machine, a synthesizer, or a sampler * A music sequencer * A control surface that is a combination of knobs (potentiometers or rotary encoders), sliders, buttons, and display elements (LEDs and/or an LCD screen) The integration of these elements into a single system allows the musician to rapidly construct and control a pattern-based sequence, often with multiple instrumental or percussion voices playing simultaneously. These sequences may also be quickly chained together into a song in a live performance. Grooveboxes allow sequences and songs to be saved, retrieved from memory, and inserted into the current performance whilst playing. In some cases, an entire musical performance may be created by a single player with a single groovebox. In other cases, the groovebox is simply one instrument amongst many. This is reflected by the large variety of grooveboxes available, ranging from Roland's lower-end MC and SP products with include basic sequencing and sampling capabilities, to Akai's flagship MPC 4000 and 5000, Yamaha's RS7000 or Roland's own MV-8800 which include features such as high-end sampling, high- polyphony synthesizers, and extensive sequencing, connection and storage possibilities. Groovebox style instruments have facilitated many performers, both amateur and professional, who may have previously been unfamiliar with electronic music, to explore the genre. Whilst some in the genre initially derided these instruments (in particular the MC-303) and the opening of the field as leading to a drop in standards, they are now generally accepted as having a legitimate place in the form. In addition, many performers and bands from outside the electronic community have integrated groovebox instruments into their shows, as a convenient way of incorporating electronic sound into a more traditional format. The sequencer and control aspects of a groovebox may be used to control an external instrument over MIDI, and the internal voices may similarly be controlled by external equipment. A groovebox is similar to a music workstation. The general differences are that it will often omit, or include only a simplified keyboard, is designed to be portable, and will usually include more user controls. Whereas a workstation is often targeted towards studio musicians and composers, grooveboxes are designed more to suit the needs of live performers. However, units matching either description are used both on stage and in the studio. A defining characteristic of a groovebox is the ability for the performer to alter both the sequence and the sound parameters in real time, without interruption of the performance. Units marketed as such, which have failed to implement this feature correctly, or at all, have not been well received. Grooveboxes may also be compared to drum machines such as the earlier Roland TR series (606, 808, 909 etc.), or to their TB-303, and the term has retroactively been applied to such units.

which peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at No. 7 and No. 17, respectively. The band consists of Chris Barron (lead vocals), Eric Schenkman (guitar and vocals), Aaron Comess (drums), and Mark White (bass guitar). History The group originated in the late 1980s in New York City, originally as a band called Trucking Company; this band included Canadian guitarist Eric Schenkman, harmonicist John Popper, and later vocalist Chris Barron, who was Popper's Princeton, New Jersey high school friend. Popper left this side project to focus on his main gig with Blues Traveler full-time. With a name change to Spin Doctors, as well as the addition of Aaron Comess on drums and Mark White on bass, the classic lineup was in place by the spring of 1989. Spin Doctors signed with Epic Records/Sony Music A&R; executive Frankie LaRocka in 1991. The band's Epic debut EP Up for Grabs...Live was recorded live at the Wetlands Preserve in lower Manhattan, and released in January 1991. (In November 1992, these EP tracks were remixed and supplemented by additional live recordings to form the album Homebelly Groove...Live.) Spin Doctors were known for their somewhat lengthy live shows, sometimes jamming even more than is evident on their live releases. They also often performed double-bill gigs opening for Blues Traveler, with members of both bands all jamming together as the transition from Spin Doctors set into the Blues Traveler set. Spin Doctors have many songs from their early club days that were never officially released, but remain circulated via concert recordings. Spin Doctors's debut studio album Pocket Full of Kryptonite was released in August 1991. The band continued to play extensive live shows, gaining grassroots fans, as the album was mostly ignored commercially. In the summer of 1992, the band toured with the first lineup of the H.O.R.D.E. festival, sharing the stage with fellow jam bands Widespread Panic, Blues Traveler, and Phish. That summer, commercial popularity heated up, as radio and MTV began playing \\"Little Miss Can't Be Wrong\\" and \\"Two Princes\\", with the videos directed by filmmaker Rich Murray (who would direct many of the band's videos). The album went Gold in September 1992, and then received another boost in sales after the band's appearance on Saturday Night Live in October 1992. Additional videos and singles followed for \\"What Time Is It,\\" \\"How Could You Want Him (When You Know You Could Have Me?),\\" and \\"Jimmy Olsen's Blues.\\" By June 1993, the album went Triple Platinum. Ultimately it sold over five million copies in the U.S. and another five million overseas, and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Mark White in 2017 \\"[Their] popularity is based on universal rock & roll virtues,\\" said Rolling Stone, which put the band on the cover of its January 7, 1993 issue. \\"The Doctors aren't trying to blaze new trails. They know we've been down this way with the Stones, Curtis Mayfield, and a few of their other touchstones. But the proof--plenty of it--is in the party.\\" Spin Doctors made an appearance on Sesame Street (episode 3450), singing a modified version of \\"Two Princes\\" that emphasized the importance of sharing. In 1993, they recorded covers of \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\\", originally by Creedence Clearwater Revival, for the film Philadelphia and \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" for Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix. Spin Doctors's second studio album, Turn It Upside Down, released in June 1994, was not as commercially successful as Pocket Full of Kryptonite, although it did sell a million copies in the United States and a million overseas. The second single, \\"You Let Your Heart Go Too Fast\\", was a modest hit (#42 on the pop chart). This album also featured \\"Cleopatra's Cat\\", \\"Mary Jane\\", \\"Hungry Hamed's\\", and \\"Bags of Dirt\\". The band set out on a three-month headlining tour, and played to large crowds at Woodstock '94 and the Glastonbury Festival. Shortly after the release of Turn It Upside Down, original guitarist Eric Schenkman left the band in September 1994 by walking offstage during a concert in Berkeley, California citing musical and personal differences, and being weary of the road. Schenkman was replaced by Anthony Krizan. Featuring new guitarist Krizan, Spin Doctors released You've Got to Believe in Something in May 1996. It produced the single and video \\"She Used to Be Mine\\". They performed on the Late Show with David Letterman and did some touring, with Ivan Neville joining the band on keyboards. During this period, Spin Doctors contributed the theme song to Seasons 2 and 3 of the television show Spin City. After touring wrapped up in the fall of 1996, Krizan eventually left the band, for reasons that remain relatively unknown. He was replaced by Israeli musician Eran Tabib after auditioning nearly 200 candidates. You've Got to Believe in Something did not live up to previous album sales, selling only 75,000 copies. Epic dropped the band in 1996. Barron singing with Schenkman playing guitar In 1998, Spin Doctors signed to Uptown/Universal and released Here Comes the Bride in June 1999. During the recording of Here Comes the Bride, Mark White left the band. The bass tracks on the album were finished by original band member Aaron Comess. During the tour supporting Here Comes the Bride, Barron lost his voice due to a rare acute form of vocal cord paralysis that severely affected his ability to talk, let alone sing. He was told he had a 50-50 chance of ever talking or singing normally again. Keyboardist Ivan Neville also took over vocal duties for a few dates, but the band eventually cancelled the remainder of its tour. Barron's voice came back in early 2000 (first comeback [solo] shows in March 2000), at which point he began performing with his band and the Give Daddy Five. Barron undertook what he calls \\"a journeyman songwriting experience,\\" composing tunes with Blues Traveler's John Popper and with former BMI executive Jeff Cohen. Spin Doctors remained inactive as a band until September 2001, when news about the closing of Wetlands sparked the original four members to reunite. On September 7, 2001, the original lineup took the stage for the first time since 1994 to play at Wetlands. It was the final closing week of the club. The landmark show was a great success for the fans and the band. Odd shows followed in 2002 through 2005, which eventually led to a brand new studio album, Nice Talking to Me, released on September 13, 2005. The single \\"Can't Kick the Habit\\" was included on the soundtrack to the movie Grandma's Boy. It received moderate radio airplay, along with the songs \\"Margarita\\" and the title track \\"Nice Talking to Me\\". While the record received good reviews, follow-up proved difficult when the record company that released it went out of business. In 2008, the band continued to play one-off live shows in the United States and Europe. Drummer Aaron Comess released an instrumental record of all his own compositions entitled Catskills Cry featuring bassist Tony Levin and guitarist Bill Dillon. In 2009, Barron released the solo record Pancho and the Kid on Valley Entertainment. During the summer of 2010, Barron released Songs from the Summer of Sangria. This five-song EP was his first official release with his band The Time Bandits. In 2011, the band celebrated the 20-year anniversary of Pocket Full of Kryptonite with a UK and US tour. Sony Legacy released a 20th anniversary edition with bonus material on August 29, 2011. In April 2013, the band released If the River Was Whiskey, their sixth studio album.

Originally created in 1934 as a brand of Otto Berning and Co., it became part of the Jenoptik group of optical companies in 1999. In 2002 the company changed its name from Robot Foto & Electronic to ROBOT Visual Systems GmbH. The motorized amateur cameras powered by clockwork (spring) motors were first made in 1934, and ended with a special limited edition collector's model, \\"Star Classic\\", in 1996. The Robot film cameras used 35 mm film, mostly in square 24 √ó 24 mm image format, but many used 18 √ó 24 mm (half-frame) and 24 √ó 36 mm (standard Leica format), and non-standard formats such as 6 √ó 24 mm (Recorder 6), 12 √ó 24 mm (Recorder 12) and 16 √ó 16 mm (Robot SC). Clockwork cameras =Robot I= Around 1930 Heinz Kilfitt, a trained watchmaker, designed a new 35 mm film compact camera using a 24√ó24 mm frame format (instead of the Leica 24√ó36 mm or cine 18√ó24 mm formats). The 24√ó24mm square frame provided many advantages, including allowing over 50 exposures per standard roll of Leica film instead of 36. Kodak and Agfa rejected the design, and it was sold to Hans Berning, who set up the Otto Berning firm. Otto Berning was granted its first Robot patent in 1934; a US patent was granted in 1936.http://www.vintagephoto.tv/patents.shtml See \\"Heinz Kilfitt - Photographic Camera, 1936 (Robot Camera)\\" on this page for Kilfitt's US patent of \\"a photographic camera in which the feed of the film is effected automatically by a spring mechanism\\" The camera was originally intended to come in two versions: Robot I, without motor, and Robot II with a spring motor. Its release was delayed and already the first camera \\"Robot I\\" included its hallmark spring motor. The first production cameras had a stainless steel body, a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second, and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second. The camera used proprietary \\"Type K\\" cartridges, not the now-standard 35 mm cartridges introduced in the same year by Kodak's Dr. August Nagel Kamerawerk for the Retina. The camera does not have a rangefinder, as it was designed for use mostly with short focal length lenses (e.g. 40 mm) with great depth of field. The Robot I was quite small, the body measuring 4¬º inches long, 2¬Ω inches high, and 1¬º inches deep. A very sharp zone-focusing f/2.8, 3.25 cm Zeiss Tessar lens added 1/2 inch to the camera depth. It was about the size of the much later Olympus Stylus although it weighed about 20 ounces, approximately the weight of a modern SLR. The die-cast zinc and stamped stainless steel body was crammed with clockwork. A spring motor on the top plate provided the driving force for a rotary behind-the-lens shutter and a sprocket film drive. The film was loaded into cassettes in a darkroom or changing bag. The cassettes appear to be based on the Agfa Memo cassette design, the now-standard Kodak 35 mm cassette not yet being popular in Germany. In place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes, the Robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage. When the camera back was shut, the compression opened the passage and the film could travel freely from one cassette to another. The rotary shutter and the film drive are like those used in cine cameras. When the shutter release is pressed, a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector; when the pressure is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens, and the spring motor advances the film and recocks the shutter. This is almost instantaneous. With practice a photographer could take 4 or 5 pictures a second. Each winding of the spring motor was good for about 25 pictures, half a roll of film. Shutter speed was determined by spring tension and mechanical delay since the exposure sector was fixed. The Robot I had an exposure range of 1 to 1/500, and provision for time exposures. The camera had other features not specifically related to action photography. The small optical viewfinder could be rotated 90 degrees to permit pictures to be taken in one direction while the photographer was facing in another. When the viewfinder was rotated, the scene was viewed through a deep purple filter similar to those used by cinematographers to judge the black and white contrast of an image. The camera had a built-in deep yellow filter which could be positioned behind the lens. =Robot II= Robot II with Xenar 1:2,8/37,5 lens In 1938 Berning introduced the Robot II, a slightly larger camera with some significant improvements but still using the basic mechanism. Among the standard lenses were a 3 cm Zeiss Tessar and a 3.75 cm Zeiss Tessar in f/2.8 and 3.5 variations, a f/2.0, 40 mm Zeiss Biotar and f/4, 7.5 cm Zeiss Sonnar. The film cassette system was redesigned, and the 1951 IIa accepted a standard 35 mm cassette. The special Robot cassettes type-N continued to be used for take-up. A small Bakelite box was sold to allow colour film to be rewound into the original cassettes as required by film processing companies. The camera was synchronized for flash. The swinging viewfinder was retained, but now operated by a lever rather than moving the entire housing. Both the deep purple and yellow filters were eliminated in the redesign. Some versions were available with a double-wind motor which could expose 50 frames on one winding. Civilian versions of the Robot were discontinued at the outset of the Second World War, but it was used as a bomb damage assessment camera by the Luftwaffe, mounted in the tail of JU87 (Stuka) dive bombers. This was an electrically driven camera using large cassettes possibly as large as 300 24 x 24mm images. Unlike the central Leica 250GG camera in the JU87, which was switched on automatically when the dive brakes were applied, the Robot camera had to be switched on manually. In the stress of the automatic pull out, when it was not uncommon for the pilot to black out from the g levels, switching on the bomb damage assessment camera was frequently forgotten.

There are two versions, Robot Royal 36, produce 36 24x36mm images on a roll of 135 film, Robot Royal 24 makes 50 24x24mm images on 135 film =Robot Star= 300px In the 1950s Robot introduced the Robot Star. Film could now be rewound into the feed cassette in the camera as in other 35 mm cameras. Robot then introduced the \\"Junior\\", an economy model with the quality and almost all the features of the \\"Star\\" but without the angle finder or the rewind mechanism. In the late 1950s the company, now called Robot-Berning, redesigned the Robot Star and created the Vollautomat Star II. The length stayed the same but the height increased by half an inch. The new higher top housing disposed of the right angle finder and instead included an Albada finder with frames for the factory-fitted 38/40 mm and 75 mm lenses. The drive and shutter too were improved. By 1960 the hallmark stamped steel body was replaced by heavier die castings. The camera became, with slight changes, the Robot Star 25 and Star 50. The Robot Star 25 could expose 25 frames on a single winding, and the double-motor Robot Star 50 could expose 50 frames. Since most Robot cameras by then were sold for industrial use where the camera was fixed in position, Robot also introduced versions without a finder, and even without rewind. Although most production dates from the 1950-1960s era, essentially the same camera continued to be manufactured into the late 1990s. During the Cold War, Robots had a large following in the espionage business. The small camera could be concealed in a briefcase or a handbag, the lens poking though a decorative hole, and activated repeatedly by a cable release concealed in the handle. The company was well aware of this market and produced a variety of accessories which made the camera even more suitable for covert photography. Robot-Berning also produced enlarged versions of the Robot, the Robot Royal 18, 24 and 36, with built-in rangefinder and with an autoburst mode of operation capable of shooting 6 frames per second. The camera was about the size of a Leica M3 and weighed almost 2 pounds. It was equipped with a Schneider Xenar 45 mm f/2.8 lens. The Robot Royal 36 took a standard 35 mm still picture but was identical to the Royal 24 in all other regards. They retained the behind-the-lens rotary shutter with speeds from 1/2 to 1/500 s. A version for instrumentation (and traffic) was also created on the basis of the Royal design: the Recorder. These cameras were like the Royal but without viewfinder or rangefinder. They had interfaces to motors and detachable backs to support bulk film cassettes. A special parallel series of the Royal too was available that included these features. While the Royal had only limited market success, the Recorder was well accepted. It became the centerpiece of the company's portable document capture, traffic control and security solutions, and continues to be the standard Robot camera for instrumentation applications. While the Robots were capable of sequence photography, the shutter that made this possible placed some constraints upon taking lenses and shutter speeds. To reach speeds as high as 1/500 second the inertia of the thin vulcanite shutter disc had to be kept at a minimum, requiring a small-diameter disc with a minimal sector opening. The screw in lens mount was 26 mm in diameter. The clear lens opening was only 20 mm. In contrast, Leica's mount was almost twice as large at 39 mm. Further, to permit lens interchangeability, the shutter was mounted behind the lens so the disc interrupted the expanding light cone. This placed some limits on lens design. While the 75mm Sonnar could be used with the aperture set to f/22, the Tele-Xenar suffered from some shutter disc vignetting unless opened more. The maximum focal length lens for general photographic use that could be fitted with acceptable vignetting was 75 mm, although telephotos up to 600 mm were offered. A 150 mm Tele-Xenar was available for long-distance action photography, but it produced a vignetted circular image on the 24 √ó 24 mm frame. The lack of a rangefinder on the Robot and Robot Star required zone focusing of these long lenses: every shot had to be estimated or premeasured. All of the mechanical movement made for a noisy camera, although not as noisy as some modern motor drives. For an extra fee, Robot-Berning supplied silenced versions with nylon gears. Within their limits the Robots did an excellent job of sequence photography. The standard 38 mm f/2.8 Xenar lenses were extremely sharp, even by today's standards, and zone focusing worked well on rapid action with short focal length lenses. The reliable motor drive was as fast, if not faster, than later electrical drives, and there were no batteries to run down. Flash could be used at any speed. The square frame was big enough, with modern films, for 8 √ó 10\\" or greater enlargements, and 50 pictures could be taken on a standard 36-exposure roll. The cameras, especially the later ones built to industrial standards, will take much abuse and still keep functioning. =Robot Luftwaffen Eigentum= Otto Berning made a Robot camera specially for German Airforce-- The Robot Luftwaffen Eigentum Robot Luftwaffen Eigentum with Robot 12V solenoid shutter actuator Robot Luftwaffen Eigentum References *Robot 1 External links *Heinz Kilfitt - Biographical Notes Cameras ","title":"Robot (camera)"},{"id":"175905","text":"Iwo Jima (, also ),\\"Iwo Jima\\" (US) and known in Japan as , is one of the Japanese Volcano Islands and lies south of the Bonin Islands. Together with other islands, they form the Ogasawara Archipelago. The highest point of Iwo Jima is Mount Suribachi at high. Although south of the metropolis of Tokyo on the mainland, this island of 21 km2 (8 square miles) is administered as part of the Ogasawara Subprefecture of Tokyo. Since July 1944, when the all civilians were forcibly evacuated, the island has had a military-only population. The island was the location of the Battle of Iwo Jima between February 1945‚ÄìMarch 1945. The island became globally recognized when Joe Rosenthal, of the Associated Press, published his photograph Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, taken on Mount Suribachi. The US military occupied Iwo Jima until 1968, when it was returned to Japan. Name The first European to arrive at Iwo Jima was Spanish sailor Bernardo de la Torre who named it Sufre Island, after the old Spanish term for sulphur (azufre in modern Spanish). At that time Iwo Jima and other nearby islands represented boundaries between the Spanish and Portuguese Empires within the far East as the demarcation line of the Treaty of Zaragoza crossed the area. In 1779, the island was charted as Sulphur Island, the literal translation of its official name, during Captain James Cook's third surveying voyage.Patrick, John M. Iwo Jima ‚Äì Sulphur Island. United States Naval Institute Proceedings 76, no. 9 (September 1950): 1028-1029. Airport Control Tower, 2010 The name \\"Sulphur Island\\" was translated into Late Middle Japanese with the Sino-Japanese rendering iwau-tau (, modern Japanese I≈ç-t≈ç), from Middle Chinese ljuw-huang \\"sulfur\\" and t√°w \\"island\\". The historical spelling iwautauK≈çjien dai rokuban (Japanese dictionary). Iwanami shoten, 2008. had come to be pronounced (approximately) Iw≈ç-t≈ç by the age of Western exploration, and the 1946 orthography reform fixed the spelling and pronunciation at I≈ç-t≈ç. An alternative, Iw≈ç-jima, modern I≈ç-jima, also appeared in nautical atlases. (T≈ç and shima are different readings of the kanji for , the shima being changed to jima in this case.) Japanese naval officers who arrived to fortify the island before the U.S. invasion mistakenly called it Iw≈ç-jima, and in this way, the Iwo Jima reading became mainstream and was the one used by U.S. forces who arrived during World War II. Former island residents protested against this rendering, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism's Geographical Survey Institute debated the issue and formally announced on June 18, 2007, that the official Japanese pronunciation of the island's name would revert to the pre- war I≈ç-t≈ç. Moves to revert the pronunciation were sparked by the high-profile films Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. The change does not affect how the name is written with kanji, , only how it is pronounced or written in hiragana, katakana and r≈çmaji. Geography Aerial view of Iwo Jima in 2014 Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima Iwo Jima from the International Space Station in 2016 The island has an approximate area of . The most prominent feature is Mount Suribachi on the southern tip, a vent that is thought to be dormant and is high. Named after a Japanese grinding bowl, the summit of Mount Suribachi is the highest point on the island. Iwo Jima is unusually flat and featureless for a volcanic island. Suribachi is the only obvious volcanic feature, as the island is only the resurgent dome (raised centre) of a larger submerged volcanic caldera surrounding the island. 80 km (43 nautical miles, 50 mi) north of the island is and south is ; these three islands make up the Volcano Islands group of the Ogasawara Islands. Just south of Minami-I≈ç-jima are the Mariana Islands. The visible island stands on a plateau (probably made by wave erosion) at depth about 15 m, which is the top of an underwater mountain 2 km tall and 40 km diameter at base.https://www.volcanocafe.org/iwo- jima-in-45-eruptions/ =Eruption history= Iwo Jima has a history of minor volcanic activity a few times per year (fumaroles, and their resultant discolored patches of seawater nearby),kaiho.mlit.go.jp but no evidence of an impending major eruption has been observed.

History =Pre-1945= The island was first visited by a westerner in October 1543, by Spanish sailor Bernardo de la Torre on board the carrack San Juan de Letr√°n when trying to return from Sarangani to New Spain.Brand, Donald D. The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations The American Geographical Society (New York, 1967) p. 123. In the late 16th century, the island was discovered by the Japanese. Before World War II Iwo Jima was administered as I≈çjima village and was (and is today) part of Tokyo. A census in June 1943 reported an island civilian population of 1,018 (533 males, 485 females) in 192 households in six settlements. The island had a primary school, a Shinto shrine, and one police officer; it was serviced by a mail ship from Haha-jima once a month, and by Nippon Yusen ship once every couple of months. The island's economy relied upon sulfur mining, sugarcane farming, and fishing; an isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with poor economic prospects, Iwo Jima had to import all rice and consumer goods from the Home Islands. Even before the beginning of World War II, there was a garrison of the Imperial Japanese Navy at the southern part of Iwo Jima. It was off-limits to the island's civilian population, who already had little contact with the naval personnel, except for trading. B-24 Liberators after attacking Iwo Jima on December 15, 1944 Throughout 1944, Japan conducted a massive military buildup on Iwo Jima in anticipation of a U.S. invasion. In July 1944, the island's civilian population was forcibly evacuated, and no civilians have permanently settled on the island since. =Battle of Iwo Jima= The American invasion of Iwo Jima began on February 19, 1945, and continued to March 26, 1945. The battle was a major initiative of the Pacific Campaign of World War II. The Marine invasion, known as \\"Operation Detachment\\", was charged with the mission of capturing the airfields on the island for use by P-51 fighters, and rescue of damaged heavy bombers that were not able to reach their main bases at Guam and Saipan; until then Japanese warplanes from there had harried U.S. bombing missions to Tokyo. The battle was marked by some of the fiercest fighting of the War. The Imperial Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified, with vast bunkers, hidden artillery, and 18 kilometres (11 mi) of tunnels.Letters From Iwo Jima World War II Multimedia DatabaseJapanese Defense of Iwo Jima The battle was the first U.S. attack on the Japanese Home Islands and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the battle, over 19,000 were killed and only 1,083 taken prisoner. One of the first objectives after landing on the beachhead was the taking of Mount Suribachi. At the second raising of a flag on the peak, Joe Rosenthal photographed six Marines raising the United States flag on the fourth day of the battle (February 23). U.S. postage stamp, 1945 issue, commemorating the Battle of Iwo Jima. The photograph was extremely popular, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Photography that same year. It is regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war.Fifty Years Later, Iwo Jima Photographer Fights His Own Battle After the fall of Mount Suribachi in the south, the Japanese still held a strong position throughout the island. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi still had the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, two artillery, and three heavy mortar battalions, plus the 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death. On the night of March 25, a 300-man Japanese force launched a final counterattack led by Kuribayashi. The island was officially declared \\"secured\\" the following morning. According to the U.S. Navy, \\"The 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead.\\"history.navy.mil Comparatively, the 82-day Battle of Okinawa lasted from early April until mid-June 1945 and U.S. (five Army, two Marine Corps Divisions and Navy personnel on ships) casualties were over 62,000 of whom over 12,000 were killed or missing, while the Battle of the Bulge lasted 40 days (16 December 1944 ‚Äì 25 January 1945) with almost 90,000 U.S. casualties comprising 19,000 killed, 47,500 wounded and 23,000 captured or missing. After Iwo Jima was declared secured, about 3,000 Japanese soldiers were left alive in the island's warren of caves and tunnels. Those who could not bring themselves to commit suicide hid in the caves during the day and came out at night to prowl for provisions. Some did eventually surrender and were surprised that the Americans often received them with compassion ‚Äì offering them water, cigarettes, or coffee. The last of these stragglers, two of Lieutenant Toshihiko Ohno's men (Ohno's body was never found), Yamakage Kufuku and Matsudo Linsoki, lasted three and a half years, surrendering on January 6, 1949. The U.S. military occupied Iwo Jima until June 26, 1968, when it was returned to Japan. =Reunion of Honor= On February 19, 1985, the 40th anniversary of the day that U.S. forces began the assault on the island, veterans from both forces gathered for the Reunion of Honor just a few meters/yards away from the spot where U.S. Marines had landed on the island. During the memorial service a granite plaque was unveiled with the message: > On the 40th anniversary of the battle of Iwo Jima, American and Japanese > veterans met again on these same sands, this time in peace and friendship. > We commemorate our comrades, living and dead, who fought here with bravery > and honor, and we pray together that our sacrifices on Iwo Jima will always > be remembered and never be repeated. It is inscribed on both sides of the plaque, with the English translation facing the beaches where U.S. forces landed and the Japanese translation facing inland, where Japanese troops defended their position. After that, the Japan‚ÄìU.S. combination memorial service of the 50th anniversary was held in front of this monument in March 1995. The 55th anniversary was held in 2000, followed by a 60th reunion in March 2005 (see U.S. National Park Service photo below), and a 70th anniversary ceremony on March 21, 2015. A memorial service held on the island in 2007 got particular attention because it coincided with the release of the movie Letters from Iwo Jima. The joint U.S.‚ÄìJapanese ceremony was attended by Yoshitaka Shindo, a Japanese lawmaker who is the grandson of the Japanese commander during the battle, Lt. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi, and Yasunori Nishi, the son of Colonel Baron Takeichi Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist equestrian who died commanding a tank unit on the island.

The airstrip is 2,650 meters (8,700 ft) long and 60 meters (200 ft) wide. The JMSDF is in charge of support, air traffic control, fueling, and rescue. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force also uses the base. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force is in charge of explosive ordnance disposal, and maintains a garrison of 400 troops on the island. Two abandoned airfields from World War II are nearby, Central Field to the south of the current air base, and an unfinished Japanese airfield to the north of the base, which was improved after the U.S. invasion of the island. The U.S. Navy's Carrier Air Wing Five, based at the United States Naval Air Facility Atsugi when not deployed aboard , also uses the base for field carrier landing practice (FCLP). The U.S. Navy still has a disused communication facility (Iwo-Jima Communication Site) on the island, while the U.S. Coast Guard's Iwo Jima LORAN-C transmitter facility was transferred to Japan in 1993 and demolished in 1994. Civilian access to the island is restricted to those attending memorial services for U.S. and Japanese fallen soldiers, construction workers for the naval air base, and meteorological agency officials. The Japanese troops stationed on the island register their residential addresses in Ayase, Kanagawa or Sayama, Saitama for voting, tax, and social security purposes. Officially, there is no population on the island. =U.S. nuclear arms base= Iwo Jima is claimed to be one of a number of Japanese islands which has been used by the United States to host nuclear arms, according to Robert S. Norris, William M. Arkin, and William Burr writing for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in early 2000. This is despite a Japanese policy of not allowing nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. Whether the site is used for this purpose is unknown, as great secrecy surrounds the United States' siting of nuclear arms bases; but on December 12, 1999, U.S. Under Secretary for Defense Policy Walter Slocombe told The New York Times, \\"Our position is that there have been no violations of our obligations under the security treaty and related arrangements.\\" Norris, Arkin and Burr concluded however: > There were nuclear weapons on Chichi Jima and Iwo Jima (Iwo To), an enormous > and varied nuclear arsenal on Okinawa, nuclear bombs (without their fission > cores) stored on the mainland at Misawa and Itazuke airbases (and possibly > at Atsugi, Iwakuni, Johnson, and Komaki airbases as well), and nuclear-armed > U.S. Navy ships stationed in Sasebo and Yokosuka. ...

The site of the present house dates back to the 14th century when it was a fortress belonging to Jean Meingre. Over the next few generations, the property changed hands several times, until 1520 when King Francis I arranged for construction of a new castle on the site. Built for his mistress, Marie Gaudin, the wife of Philibert Babou, Superintendent of Finances for France, after her death, the property would remain in the family's hands. Marie Gaudin's granddaughter, Gabrielle d'Estr√©es, was born in the ch√¢teau and would herself grow up to become mistress to another king, Henry IV of France. In 1775, the ch√¢teau was partially destroyed by order of King Louis XV's most powerful Minister, √âtienne Fran√ßois, Duc de Choiseul. √âtienne Fran√ßois wanted to use the stones from Ch√¢teau de la Bourdaisi√®re for the construction of his Pagoda at his estate in Chanteloup, near Amboise. Lying in ruins, in 1786 the land was sold to Louise Ad√©la√Øde of Penthi√®vre Bourbon. In 1802 the property was acquired by Baron Joseph Angelier who undertook a massive reconstruction of Ch√¢teau Bourdaisi√®re. The interior work would be completed by his son, Gustave Angelier. Although a small ch√¢teau, when compared to the great ch√¢teaux of the Kings and some of those built by other wealthy nobles, it is a magnificent Renaissance construction fronted by traditional French gardens. The Castle was sold in 1923 to a wealthy American, Mrs. de M√©rinville who sold it in 1938. During World War II, the ch√¢teau was occupied by the Nazis. After the war, a lack of funds by its owner saw it become severely run down. In 1959, its contents were auctioned off and government turned the ch√¢teau into a home for the elderly. It was sold again in 1988 to an attorney, Fran√ßois Michaud, who owned it until 1991 when it was acquired by its current owners, the Princes of Broglie who undertook significant improvements and modernization. In 2003, Ch√¢teau de la Bourdaisi√®re gained considerable attention in North America, as the primary site for the television show Joe Millionaire. In 2011, the chateaus gardens were finalist for the European Garden Award bestowed by the European Garden Heritage Network The ch√¢teau was listed as a monument historique in 1947.

History In the early 12th century Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ (973‚Äì1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the Mediterranean Basin (including the so-called \\"Middle East\\") and the Indian subcontinent. He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the Indian subcontinent. In the 19th century cultural anthropology was dominated by an interest in cultural evolution; most anthropologists assumed a simple distinction between \\"primitive\\" and \\"modern\\" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter. In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach. Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as Karl Marx (1818-1883), Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), √âmile Durkheim (1858-1917), and Max Weber (1864-1920). Anthropologists of religion are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices. In 1912 √âmile Durkheim, building on the work of Feuerbach, considered religion \\"a projection of the social values of society\\", \\"a means of making symbolic statements about society\\", \\"a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order\\"; in short, \\"religion is society worshiping itself\\".Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition Anthropologists circa 1940 assumed that religion was in complete continuity with magical thinking, and that it is a cultural product. The complete continuity between magic and religion has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s. The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the projection idea, a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human community that worships it, that \\"creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man\\". In 1841, Ludwig Feuerbach was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion. A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was Giambattista Vico (1668-1744), and an early formulation of it appears in the ancient Greek writer Xenophanes 570 ‚Äì 475 BCE)[, who observed that \\"the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes.\\"  Definition of religion  One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself. At one time anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or ghosts, the use of magic as a means of controlling the supernatural, the use of divination as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of rituals such as prayer and sacrifice as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of shamanism or ancestor worship. According to Clifford Geertz, religion is Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European primitivism). Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion - such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual - but few claim that these criteria are universally valid. Anthony F. C. Wallace proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions. # Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: vision quest. # Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The Tillamook have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers.

Emancipation, release, or liberation. The Sanskrit words vimukti, mukti, and moksha also have the same meaning. Vimoksha means release from the bonds of earthly desires, delusion, suffering, and transmigration. While Buddhism sets forth various kinds and stages of emancipation, or enlightenment, the supreme emancipation is nirvana (a 90s Band), a state of perfect quietude, freedom, and deliverance. See The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, vimoksha However, terms such as moksha and nirvana differ and mean different states between various schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.See: * Loy, David (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, 23 (1), pp 65‚Äì74; * T. Chatterjea (2003), Knowledge and Freedom in Indian Philosophy, , pp 89; Quote - \\"In different philosophical systems moksa appears in different names, such as apavarga, nihsreyasa, nirvana, kaivalya, mukti, etc. These concepts differ from one another in detail.\\" The term nirvana is more common in Buddhism,Peter Harvey (2013), An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, , Cambridge University Press while moksha is more prevalent in Hinduism.Knut Jacobsen, in The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), , pp 74-83  Etymology  Moksha is derived from the root , ', which means free, let go, release, liberate. In Vedas and early Upanishads, the word , ' appears, which means to be set free or release, such as of a horse from its harness.  Definition and meanings  The definition and meaning of moksha varies between various schools of Indian religions.M. Hiriyanna (2000), The essentials of Indian philosophy, , pp 50-52 Moksha means freedom, liberation; from what and how is where the schools differ. Moksha is also a concept that means liberation from rebirth or sa·πÉsƒÅra. This liberation can be attained while one is on earth (jivanmukti), or eschatologically (karmamukti, videhamukti). Some Indian traditions have emphasized liberation on concrete, ethical action within the world. This liberation is an epistemological transformation that permits one to see the truth and reality behind the fog of ignorance. Moksha has been defined not merely as absence of suffering and release from bondage to sa·πÉsƒÅra, various schools of Hinduism also explain the concept as presence of the state of paripurna-brahmanubhava (the experience of oneness with Brahman, the One Supreme Self), a state of knowledge, peace and bliss.see: * S. R. Bhatt (1976), The Concept of Moksha-- An Analysis, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 36, No. 4 (Jun., 1976), pp. 564-570; * S.M.S.

Samsara originated with religious movements in the first millennium BCE. These movements such as Buddhism, Jainism and new schools within Hinduism, saw human life as bondage to a repeated process of rebirth. This bondage to repeated rebirth and life, each life subject to injury, disease and aging, was seen as a cycle of suffering. By release from this cycle, the suffering involved in this cycle also ended. This release was called moksha, nirvana, kaivalya, mukti and other terms in various Indian religious traditions.R.C. Mishra, Moksha and the Hindu Worldview, Psychology & Developing Societies, Vol. 25, Issue 1, pp 23, 27 Eschatological ideas evolved in Hinduism.N. Ross Reat (1990), The Origins of Indian Psychology, , Asian Humanities Press, Chapter 2 In earliest Vedic literature, heaven and hell sufficed soteriological curiosities. Over time, the ancient scholars observed that people vary in the quality of virtuous or sinful life they lead, and began questioning how differences in each person's pu·πáya (merit, good deeds) or pƒÅp (demerit, sin) as human beings affected their afterlife.See: * Simon Brodbeck (2011), Sanskrit Epics: The Ramayana, Mahabharata and Harivamsa, in Jessica Frazier (Editor) - The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies, , pp 83-100 * J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 33-40 This question led to the conception of an afterlife where the person stayed in heaven or hell, in proportion to their merit or demerit, then returned to earth and were reborn, the cycle continuing indefinitely. The rebirth idea ultimately flowered into the ideas of sa·πÉsƒÅra, or transmigration - where one's balance sheet of karma determined one's rebirth. Along with this idea of sa·πÉsƒÅra, the ancient scholars developed the concept of moksha, as a state that released a person from the sa·πÉsƒÅra cycle. Moksha release in eschatological sense in these ancient literature of Hinduism, suggests van Buitenen,J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 33-40 comes from self-knowledge and consciousness of oneness of supreme soul. = Epistemological and psychological senses = Scholars provide various explanations of the meaning of moksha in epistemological and psychological senses. For example, Deutsche sees moksha as transcendental consciousness, the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of \\"realizing the whole universe as the Self\\".E. Deutsch, The self in Advaita Vedanta, in Roy Perrett (Editor), Indian philosophy: metaphysics, Volume 3, , Taylor and Francis, pp 343-360 Moksha in Hinduism, suggests Klaus Klostermaier,Klaus Klostermaier, Mok·π£a and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pp. 61-71 implies a setting-free of hitherto fettered faculties, a removing of obstacles to an unrestricted life, permitting a person to be more truly a person in the full sense; the concept presumes an unused human potential of creativity, compassion and understanding which had been blocked and shut out. Moksha is more than liberation from a life-rebirth cycle of suffering (samsara); the Vedantic school separates this into two: jivanmukti (liberation in this life) and videhamukti (liberation after death).see: * M. von Br√ºck (1986), Imitation or Identification?, Indian Theological Studies, Vol. 23, Issue 2, pp 95-105 * Klaus Klostermaier, Mok·π£a and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pp. 61-71 Moksha in this life includes psychological liberation from adhyasa (fears besetting one's life) and avidya (ignorance or anything that is not true knowledge).  As a state of perfection  Gajendra Moksha (pictured) is a symbolic tale in Vaishnavism. The elephant Gajendra enters a lake where a crocodile (Huhu) clutches his leg and becomes his suffering. Despite his pain, Gajendra constantly remembers Vishnu, who then liberates him. Gajendra symbolically represents human beings, Huhu represents sins, and the lake is sa·πÉsƒÅra. Many schools of Hinduism according to Daniel Ingalls, see moksha as a state of perfection. The concept was seen as a natural goal beyond dharma. Moksha, in the epics and ancient literature of Hinduism, is seen as achievable by the same techniques necessary to practice dharma. Self-discipline is the path to dharma, moksha is self- discipline that is so perfect that it becomes unconscious, second nature. Dharma is thus a means to moksha.see: * Karl Potter, Dharma and Mok·π£a from a Conversational Point of View, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1958), pp. 49-63 * Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 41-48 The Samkhya school of Hinduism, for example, suggests that one of the paths to moksha is to magnify one's sattvam.One of three qualities or habits of an individual; sattvam represents spiritual purity; sattvic people, claims Samkhya school, are those who see world's welfare as a spiritual principle. See cited Ingalls reference.Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 45-46 To magnify one's sattvam, one must develop oneself where one's sattvam becomes one's instinctive nature. Many schools of Hinduism thus understood dharma and moksha as two points of a single journey of life, a journey for which the viaticum was discipline and self-training. Over time, these ideas about moksha were challenged.  Nagarjuna's challenge  Dharma and moksha, suggested Nagarjuna in the 2nd century, cannot be goals on the same journey.Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 46 He pointed to the differences between the world we live in, and the freedom implied in the concept of moksha. They are so different that dharma and moksha could not be intellectually related. Dharma requires worldly thought, moksha is unworldly understanding, a state of bliss. How can the worldly thought- process lead to unworldly understanding? asked Nagarjuna. Karl Potter explains the answer to this challenge as one of context and framework, the emergence of broader general principles of understanding from thought processes that are limited in one framework.Karl Potter, Dharma and Mok·π£a from a Conversational Point of View, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1958), pp. 49-63  Adi Shankara's challenge  Adi Shankara in the 8th century AD, like Nagarjuna earlier, examined the difference between the world one lives in and moksha, a state of freedom and release one hopes for.Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 47 Unlike Nagarjuna, Shankara considers the characteristics between the two. The world one lives in requires action as well as thought; our world, he suggests, is impossible without vyavahara (action and plurality). The world is interconnected, one object works on another, input is transformed into output, change is continuous and everywhere. Moksha, suggests Shankara, is that final perfect, blissful state where there can be no change, where there can be no plurality of states. It has to be a state of thought and consciousness that excludes action. How can action-oriented techniques by which we attain the first three goals of man (kama, artha and dharma) be useful to attain the last goal, namely moksha? Scholarssee: * Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp 41-48 * R Sinari (1982), The concept of human estrangement in plotinism and Shankara Vedanta, in \\"Neoplatonism and Indian thought\\", Ed: R.B. Harris, Albany, NY, pp 243-255 * R.K. Tripathi (1982), Advaita Vedanta and Neoplatonism, in \\"Neoplatonism and Indian thought\\", Ed: R.B. Harris, Albany, NY, pp 237; also see pp 294-297 by Albert Wolters suggest Shankara's challenge to the concept of moksha parallels those of Plotinus against the Gnostics, with one important difference: Plotinus accused the Gnostics of exchanging an anthropocentric set of virtues with a theocentric set in pursuit of salvation; Shankara challenged that the concept of moksha implied an exchange of anthropocentric set of virtues (dharma) with a blissful state that has no need for values. Shankara goes on to suggest that anthropocentric virtues suffice.  The Vaisnavas' challenge  Vaishnavism, one of the bhakti schools of Hinduism, is devoted to the worship of God, sings his name, anoints his image or idol, and has many sub-schools. Vaishnavas (followers of Vaishnavism) suggest that dharma and moksha cannot be two different or sequential goals or states of life. Daniel H. H. Ingalls, \\"Dharma and Moksha\\", Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 48 Instead, they suggest God should be kept in mind constantly to simultaneously achieve dharma and moksha, so constantly that one comes to feel one cannot live without God's loving presence. This school emphasized love and adoration of God as the path to \\"moksha\\" (salvation and release), rather than works and knowledge. Their focus became divine virtues, rather than anthropocentric virtues. Daniel Ingalls regards Vaishnavas' position on moksha as similar to the Christian position on salvation, and Vaishnavism as the school whose views on dharma, karma and moksha dominated the initial impressions and colonial-era literature on Hinduism, through the works of Thibaut, Max M√ºller and others.  History  The concept of moksha appears much later in ancient Indian literature than the concept of dharma. The proto-concept that first appears in the ancient Sanskrit verses and early Upanishads is mucyate, which means freed or released. It is the middle and later Upanishads, such as the Svetasvatara and Maitri, where the word moksha appears and begins becoming an important concept.see: * Klaus Klostermaier (1985), Mok·π£a and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, 35 (1), pp 61-71 * Roeser, R.W.

Elsevier, pp. 297-345 Kathaka Upanishad,Sometimes called Katha Upanishad - for example, by Max Muller, Nakhilananda a middle Upanishadic era script dated to be about 2500 years old, is among the earliest expositions about sa·πÉsƒÅra and moksha. In Book I, Section III, the legend of boy Naciketa queries Yama, the lord of death to explain what causes sa·πÉsƒÅra and what leads to liberation.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, , pp 269-290 Naciketa inquires: what causes sorrow? Yama explains that suffering and sa·πÉsƒÅra results from a life that is lived absent-mindedly, with impurity, with neither the use of intelligence nor self-examination, where neither mind nor senses are guided by one's atma (soul, self).[a] Atman, Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press (2012), Quote: \\"1. real self of the individual; 2. a person's soul\\"; [b] John Bowker (2000), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press, , See entry for Atman; [c] WJ Johnson (2009), A Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, , See entry for Atman (self).[a] David Lorenzen (2004), The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, , pages 208-209, Quote: \\"Advaita and nirguni movements, on the other hand, stress an interior mysticism in which the devotee seeks to discover the identity of individual soul (atman) with the universal ground of being (brahman) or to find god within himself\\".; [b] Richard King (1995), Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, State University of New York Press, , page 64, Quote: \\"Atman as the innermost essence or soul of man, and Brahman as the innermost essence and support of the universe. (...) Thus we can see in the Upanishads, a tendency towards a convergence of microcosm and macrocosm, culminating in the equating of atman with Brahman\\". [c] Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, , page 63; Quote: \\"Even though Buddhism explicitly rejected the Hindu ideas of Atman (soul) and Brahman, Hinduism treats Sakyamuni Buddha as one of the ten avatars of Vishnu.\\" Liberation comes from a life lived with inner purity, alert mind, led by buddhi (reason, intelligence), realization of the Supreme Self (purusha) who dwells in all beings. Kathaka Upanishad asserts knowledge liberates, knowledge is freedom.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, , pp 283-289S. Nikhilananda, The Principal Upanishads, Dover Publications, , pp 63-84 Kathaka Upanishad also explains the role of yoga in personal liberation, moksha. Svetasvatara Upanishad, another middle era Upanishad written after Kathaka Upanishad, begins with questions such as why is man born, what is the primal cause behind the universe, what causes joy and sorrow in life?Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, , pp 301-326 It then examines the various theories, that were then existing, about sa·πÉsƒÅra and release from bondage. Svetasvatara claimsPaul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, , pp 316, 319-325 bondage results from ignorance, illusion or delusion; deliverance comes from knowledge. The Supreme Being dwells in every being, he is the primal cause, he is the eternal law, he is the essence of everything, he is nature, he is not a separate entity. Liberation comes to those who know Supreme Being is present as the Universal Spirit and Principle, just as they know butter is present in milk. Such realization, claims Svetasvatara, come from self-knowledge and self-discipline; and this knowledge and realization is liberation from transmigration, the final goal of the Upanishad.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, , pp 305-306, 322-325 Starting with the middle Upanishad era, moksha - or equivalent terms such as mukti and kaivalya - is a major theme in many Upanishads. For example, Sarasvati Rahasya Upanishad, one of several Upanishads of the bhakti school of Hinduism, starts out with prayers to Goddess Sarasvati. She is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning and creative arts; her name is a compound word of ‚Äò‚Äòsara‚Äô‚Äô‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞ Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany and ‚Äò‚Äòsva‚Äô‚Äô,‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany meaning \\"essence of self\\". After the prayer verses, the Upanishad inquires about the secret to freedom and liberation (mukti). Sarasvati's reply in the Upanishad is: = Evolution of the concept = The concept of moksha, according to Daniel Ingalls, represented one of many expansions in Hindu Vedic ideas of life and afterlife. In the Vedas, there were three stages of life: studentship, householdship and retirement. During the Upanishadic era, Hinduism expanded this to include a fourth stage of life: complete abandonment. In Vedic literature, there are three modes of experience: waking, dream and deep sleep. The Upanishadic era expanded it to include turiyam - the stage beyond deep sleep. The Vedas suggest three goals of man: kama, artha and dharma. To these, the Upanishadic era added moksha.Daniel H. H. Ingalls, Dharma and Moksha, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp. 41-48 The acceptance of the concept of moksha in some schools of Hindu philosophy was slow. These refused to recognize moksha for centuries, considering it irrelevant. The Mimamsa school, for example, denied the goal and relevance of moksha well into the 8th century AD, until the arrival of a Mimamsa scholar named Kumarila.see: * M. Hiriyanna (1952), The Quest After Perfection, Kavyalaya Publishers, pp 23-33 * John Taber, The significance of Kumarila‚Äôs Philosophy, in Roy Perrett (Ed) - Theory of Value, Vol 5, pp. 113-161 * Okita, K. (2008), Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ and VedƒÅnta: Interaction and Continuity, The Journal of Hindu Studies, 1(1-2), pp 155-156 Instead of moksha, Mimamsa school of Hinduism considered the concept of heaven as sufficient to answer the question: what lay beyond this world after death. Other schools of Hinduism, over time, accepted the moksha concept and refined it over time. It is unclear when the core ideas of samsara and moksha were developed in ancient India. Patrick Olivelle suggests these ideas likely originated with new religious movements in the first millennium BCE.Patrick Olivelle (2012), Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Moksha (Indian religions) Mukti and moksha ideas, suggests J. A. B. van Buitenen, seem traceable to yogis in Hinduism, with long hair, who chose to live on the fringes of society, given to self-induced states of intoxication and ecstasy, possibly accepted as medicine men and \\"sadhus\\" by the ancient Indian society. Moksha to these early concept developers, was the abandonment of the established order, not in favor of anarchy, but in favor of self-realization, to achieve release from this world.J.A.B. van Buitenen, in Roy Perrett (Editor) - Theory of Value, Volume 5, , Taylor & Francis, pp 25-32 Mok·π£a is a key concept in Yoga, where it is a state of ‚Äúawakening‚Äù, liberation and freedom in this life.see: * Mircea Eliade (1958, Reprinted: 2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pp 33-34; * Sarah Strauss (2005), Positioning Yoga, Berg/Oxford International, , pp 15 In its historical development, the concept of moksha appears in three forms: Vedic, yogic and bhakti. In the Vedic period, moksha was ritualistic. Mok·π£a was claimed to result from properly completed rituals such as those before Agni - the fire deity. The significance of these rituals was to reproduce and recite the cosmic creation event described in the Vedas; the description of knowledge on different levels - adhilokam, adhibhutam, adhiyajnam, adhyatmam - helped the individual transcend to moksa. Knowledge was the means, the ritual its application. By the middle to late Upanishadic period, the emphasis shifted to knowledge, and ritual activities were considered irrelevant to the attainment of moksha.Angelika Malinar (2011), in Jessica Frazier (Editor), The Bloomsbury companion to Hindu studies, , Chapter 4 Yogic mokshaKnut Jacobson, in Jessica Frazier (Editor), Continuum companion to Hindu studies, , pp 74-82 replaced Vedic rituals with personal development and meditation, with hierarchical creation of the ultimate knowledge in self as the path to moksha. Yogic moksha principles were accepted in many other schools of Hinduism, albeit with differences. For example, Adi Shankara in his book on moksha suggests: Bhakti moksha created the third historical path, where neither rituals nor meditative self-development were the way, rather it was inspired by constant love and contemplation of God, which over time results in a perfect union with God. Some Bhakti schools evolved their ideas where God became the means and the end, transcending moksha; the fruit of bhakti is bhakti itself.Klaus Klostermaier (1986), Contemporary conceptions among North Indian Vaishnavas, in Ronald Neufeldt (Editor) - Karma and Rebirth Post Classical Developments, , State University of New York Press, Chapter 5 In the history of Indian religious traditions, additional ideas and paths to moksha beyond these three, appeared over time.D. Datta (1888), Moksha, or the Ved√°ntic Release, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, New Series, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Oct., 1888), pp. 513-539 Synonyms The words moksha, nirvana (nibbana) and kaivalya are sometimes used synonymously,For example, the Adhyatma Upanishad uses all three words nirvana, kaivalya and moksha (Verses 12, 16, 69, 70); K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 55-60 because they all refer to the state that liberates a person from all causes of sorrow and suffering.A. Sharma, The realization of Kaivalya in the Poetry of Les A Murray: An Indian Perspective, Explorations in Australian Literature, , Chapter 18, pp 187 However, in modern era literature, these concepts have different premises in different religions. Nirvana, a concept common in Buddhism, is a state of realization that there is no self (no soul) and Emptiness; while moksha, a concept common in many schools of Hinduism, is acceptance of Self (soul), realization of liberating knowledge, the consciousness of Oneness with Brahman, all existence and understanding the whole universe as the Self.David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, 23(1), pp 65-74[a] [b] [c] Nirvana starts with the premise that there is no Self, moksha on the other hand, starts with the premise that everything is the Self; there is no consciousness in the state of nirvana, but everything is One unified consciousness in the state of moksha. Kaivalya, a concept akin to moksha, rather than nirvana, is found in some schools of Hinduism such as the Yoga school. Kaivalya is the realization of aloofness with liberating knowledge of one's self and union with the spiritual universe. For example, Patanjali‚Äôs Yoga Sutra suggests: Nirvana and moksha, in all traditions, represents a state of being in ultimate reality and perfection, but described in a very different way. Some scholars, states Jayatilleke, assert that the Nirvana of Buddhism is same as the Brahman in Hinduism, a view other scholars and he disagree with. Buddhism rejects the idea of Brahman, and the metaphysical ideas about soul (atman) are also rejected by Buddhism, while those ideas are essential to moksha in Hinduism. In Buddhism, nirvana is 'blowing out' or 'extinction'. In Hinduism, moksha is 'identity or oneness with Brahman'. Realization of anatta (anatman) is essential to Buddhist nirvana. Realization of atman (atta) is essential to Hindu moksha.  Hinduism  Ancient literature of different schools of Hinduism sometimes use different phrases for moksha. For example, Keval jnana or kaivalya (\\"state of Absolute\\"), Apavarga, Nihsreyasa, Paramapada, Brahmabhava, Brahmajnana and Brahmi sthiti. Modern literature additionally uses the Buddhist term nirvana interchangeably with moksha of Hinduism. There is difference between these ideas, as explained elsewhere in this article, but they are all soteriological concepts of various Indian religious traditions. The six major orthodox schools of Hinduism have had a historic debate, and disagree over whether moksha can be achieved in this life, or only after this life.A. Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, , pp 117 Many of the 108 Upanishads discuss amongst other things moksha. These discussions show the differences between the schools of Hinduism, a lack of consensus, with a few attempting to conflate the contrasting perspectives between various schools.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, For example, freedom and deliverance from birth-rebirth, argues Maitrayana Upanishad, comes neither from the Vedanta school's doctrine (the knowledge of one's own Self as the Supreme Soul) nor from the Samkhya school's doctrine (distinction of the Purusha from what one is not), but from Vedic studies, observance of the Svadharma (personal duties), sticking to Asramas (stages of life).Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1, , pp 342 The six major orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy offer the following views on moksha, each for their own reasons: the Nyaya, Vaisesika and Mimamsa schools of Hinduism consider moksha as possible only after death.Note: Each school has a different meaning for moksha. For example, Mimamsa school considers moksha as release into svarga (heaven), it does not recognize samsara; while Nyaya school considers moksha as linked to samsara and a release from it; See: The Purva-Mimamsa Sutra of Jaimini, Transl: M.L. Sandal (1923), Chapter II, Pada I and Chapter VI, Pada I through VIII; Also see Klaus Klostermaier, A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd Edition, , Chapter 26 Samkhya and Yoga schools consider moksha as possible in this life. In Vedanta school, the Advaita sub-school concludes moksha is possible in this life, while Dvaita and Visistadvaita sub-schools of Vedanta tradition believes that moksha is a continuous event, one assisted by loving devotion to God, that extends from this life to post-mortem. Beyond these six orthodox schools, some heterodox schools of Hindu tradition, such as Carvaka, deny there is a soul or after life moksha.see: * Miller, A. T.

Hinduism's Points of Contact with Christianity. IV. Salvation. The Biblical World, 4(2), pp 98-113 = SƒÅmkhya, Yoga and mok·π£a = Both SƒÅmkhya and Yoga systems of religious thought are moksha≈õƒÅstras, suggests Knut Jacobsen, they are systems of salvific liberation and release.Knut Jacobson, in Jessica Frazier (Editor), Continuum companion to Hindu studies, SƒÅmkhya is a system of interpretation, primarily a theory about the world. Yoga is both a theory and a practice. Yoga gained wide acceptance in ancient India, its ideas and practices became part of many religious schools in Hinduism, including those that were very different from SƒÅmkhya. The eight limbs of yoga can be interpreted as a way to liberation (moksha). In SƒÅmkhya literature, liberation is commonly referred to as kaivalya. In this school, kaivalya means the realization of purusa, the principle of consciousness, as independent from mind and body, as different from prakrti. Like many schools of Hinduism, in SƒÅmkhya and Yoga schools, the emphasis is on the attainment of knowledge, vidyƒÅ or j√±ƒÅna, as necessary for salvific liberation, moksha.Jeffrey Gold, Plato in the Light of Yoga, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 46, No. 1 (Jan., 1996), pp. 20-27 Yoga's purpose is then seen as a means to remove the avidyƒÅ - that is, ignorance or misleading/incorrect knowledge about one self and the universe. It seeks to end ordinary reflexive awareness (cittavrtti nirodhah) with deeper, purer and holistic awareness (asamprƒÅj√±ƒÅta samƒÅdhi).Knut Jacobsen (2011), in Jessica Frazier (Editor), The Bloomsbury companion to Hindu studies, , pp 74-82R. Sinari, The way toward Moksa, in Murty et al. (Editors) - Freedom, Progress & Society, , pp 45-60 Yoga, during the pursuit of moksha, encourages practice (abhyƒÅsa) with detachment (vairƒÅgya), which over time leads to deep concentration (samƒÅdhi). Detachment means withdrawal from outer world and calming of mind, while practice means the application of effort over time. Such steps are claimed by Yoga school as leading to samƒÅdhi, a state of deep awareness, release and bliss called kaivalya. Yoga, or mƒÅrga (meaning \\"way\\" or \\"path\\"), in Hinduism is widely classified into four spiritual approaches.See: * John Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, , see articles on bhaktimƒÅrga, jnanamƒÅrga, karmamƒÅrga; * Bhagwad Gita (The Celestial Song), Chapters 2:56-57, 12, 13:1-28 * Feuerstein, Georg (2003), The deeper dimension of yoga: Theory and practice, Shambhala, ; * D. Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Cultural Psychology, in Anthony Marsella (Series Editor), International and Cultural Psychology, Springer New York, , pp 93-140 The first mƒÅrga is J√±ƒÅna Yoga, the way of knowledge. The second mƒÅrga is Bhakti Yoga, the way of loving devotion to God. The third mƒÅrga is Karma Yoga, the way of works. The fourth mƒÅrga is RƒÅja Yoga, the way of contemplation and meditation. These mƒÅrgas are part of different schools in Hinduism, and their definition and methods to moksha.H. Negendra (2008), Int Journal of Yoga, Jul-Dec, 1(2), pp 43‚Äì44 For example, the Advaita Vedanta school relies on J√±ƒÅna Yoga in its teachings of moksha.Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta: A philosophical reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, , pp 104-106 = Vedanta and mok·π£a = The three main sub-schools in Vedanta school of Hinduism - Advaita Vedanta, Vishistadvaita and Dvaita - each have their own views about moksha. The Vedantic school of Hinduism suggests the first step towards mok·π£a begins with mumuksutva, that is desire of liberation. This takes the form of questions about self, what is true, why do things or events make us happy or cause suffering, and so on. This longing for liberating knowledge is assisted by, claims Adi Shankara of Advaita Vedanta,Shankara, Sarva vedanta siddhantasara 230-239 guru (teacher), study of historical knowledge and viveka (critical thinking). Shankara cautions that the guru and historic knowledge may be distorted, so traditions and historical assumptions must be questioned by the individual seeking moksha. Those who are on their path to moksha (samnyasin), suggests Klaus Klostermaier, are quintessentially free individuals, without craving for anything in the worldly life, thus are neither dominated by, nor dominating anyone else. Vivekachudamani, which literally means \\"Crown Jewel of Discriminatory Reasoning\\", is a book devoted to moksa in Vedanta philosophy. It explains what behaviors and pursuits lead to moksha, as well what actions and assumptions hinder moksha. The four essential conditions, according to Vivekachudamani, before one can commence on the path of moksha include (1) vivekah (discrimination, critical reasoning) between everlasting principles and fleeting world; (2) viragah (indifference, lack of craving) for material rewards; (3) samah (calmness of mind), and (4) damah (self restraint, temperance).D. Datta (1888), Moksha, or the Ved√°ntic Release, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, New Series, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Oct., 1888), pp. 516 The Brahmasutrabhasya adds to the above four requirements, the following: uparati (lack of bias, dispassion), titiksa (endurance, patience), sraddha (faith) and samadhana (intentness, commitment). The Advaita tradition considers moksha achievable by removing avidya (ignorance). Moksha is seen as a final release from illusion, and through knowledge (anubhava) of one's own fundamental nature, which is Satcitananda. Advaita holds there is no being/non-being distinction between Atman, Brahman, and Paramatman. The knowledge of Brahman leads to moksha,Anantanand Rambachan, The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas University of Hawaii Press, 1994, pages 124-125 where Brahman is described as that which is the origin and end of all things, the universal principle behind and at source of everything that exists, consciousness that pervades everything and everyone.Karl Potter (2008), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita VedƒÅnta Up to ≈öa·πÉkara and His Pupils, Volume 3, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp 210-215 Advaita Vedanta emphasizes Jnana Yoga as the means of achieving moksha. Bliss, claims this school, is the fruit of knowledge (vidya) and work (karma).Karl Potter (2008), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita VedƒÅnta Up to ≈öa·πÉkara and His Pupils, Volume 3, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp 213 The Dvaita (dualism) traditions define moksha as the loving, eternal union with God (Vishnu) and considered the highest perfection of existence. Dvaita schools suggest every soul encounters liberation differently.Betty, Stafford. \\"Dvaita, Advaita, And Vi≈õi·π£·π≠advaita: Contrasting Views Of Mok·π£a.\\" Asian Philosophy 20.2 (2010): 215-224. Academic Search Elite. Web. 24 Sept. 2012. Dualist schools (e.g. Vaishnava) see God as the object of love, for example, a personified monotheistic conception of Shiva or Vishnu. By immersing oneself in the love of God, one's karmas slough off, one's illusions decay, and truth is lived. Both the worshiped and worshiper gradually lose their illusory sense of separation and only One beyond all names remains. This is salvation to dualist schools of Hinduism. Dvaita Vedanta emphasizes Bhakti Yoga as the means of achieving moksha.N.S.S. Raman (2009), Ethics in Bhakti Philosophical Literature, in R. Prasad - A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, , Chapter 19 The Vishistadvaita tradition, led by Ramanuja, defines avidya and moksha differently from the Advaita tradition. To Ramanuja, avidya is a focus on the self, and vidya is a focus on a loving god. The Vishistadvaita school argues that other schools of Hinduism create a false sense of agency in individuals, which makes the individual think oneself as potential or self-realized god. Such ideas, claims Ramanuja, decay to materialism, hedonism and self worship. Individuals forget Ishvara (God). Mukti, to Vishistadvaita school, is release from such avidya, towards the intuition and eternal union with God (Vishnu).Abha Singh (October 2001), Social Philosophy of Ramanuja: its modern relevance, Indian Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 28, No. 4, pp 491‚Äì498 = Mok·π£a in this life = Among the Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta schools of Hinduism, liberation and freedom reached within one's life is referred to as jivanmukti, and the individual who has experienced this state is called jivanmukta (self-realized person).see: * Andrew Fort and Patricia Mumme (1996), Living Liberation in Hindu Thought, ; * Norman E. Thomas (April 1988), Liberation for Life: A Hindu Liberation Philosophy, Missiology, Volume 16, Number 2, pp 149-160 Dozens of Upanishads, including those from middle Upanishadic period, mention or describe the state of liberation, jivanmukti.See for example Muktika Upanishad, Varaha Upanishad, Adhyatma Upanishad, Sandilya Upanishad, Tejobindu Upanishad, etc.; in K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, CanadaPaul Deussen, The philosophy of the Upanishads, Translated by A.S. Geden (1906), T&T; Clark, Edinburgh Some contrast jivanmukti with videhamukti (moksha from samsara after death).Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1 & 2, Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, claim these ancient texts of Hindu philosophy. For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the liberated individual shows attributes such as:see: K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 140-147 * S. Nikhilananda (1958), Hinduism : Its meaning for the liberation of the spirit, Harper, , pp 53-79; * Andrew Fort (1998), Jivanmukti in Transformation, State University of New York Press, * he is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him; * when confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words; * even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth; * he does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others; * he never injures or harms any life or being (ahimsa), he is intent in the welfare of all beings;see also Sandilya Upanishad for ahimsa and other virtues; Quote: \\"‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ã‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§É ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§∂‡§ú‡§®‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç\\"; Aiyar translates this as: He practices Ahimsa - no injury or harm to any living being at any time through actions of his body, his speech or in his mind; K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 173-174 * he is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others; * he is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city); * he doesn‚Äôt care about or wear ·π£ikha (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters; * for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self; * he is humble, high- spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words. When a Jivanmukta dies he achieves Paramukti and becomes a Paramukta. Jivanmukta experience enlightenment and liberation while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences enlightenment and liberation only after death. = Mok·π£a in Balinese Hinduism = Balinese Hinduism incorporates moksha as one of five tattwas. The other four are: brahman (the one supreme god head, not to be confused with Brahmin), atma (soul or spirit), karma (actions and reciprocity, causality), samsara (principle of rebirth, reincarnation). Moksha, in Balinese Hindu belief, is the possibility of unity with the divine; it is sometimes referred to as nirwana.Balinese Hindus spell words slightly differently from Indian Hindus; tattva in India is spelled tattwa in Bali, nirvana in India is spelled nirwana in Bali, etc.Anna Nettheim (2011), Tattwa are the words of the world: Balinese narratives and creative transformation, Ph.D. Thesis, University of New South Wales, Australia  Buddhism  In Buddhism the term \\"moksha\\" is uncommon, but an equivalent term is vimutti, \\"release\\". In the suttas two forms of release are mentioned, namely ceto-vimutti, \\"deliverance of mind,\\" and panna-vimutti, \\"deliverance through wisdom\\" (insight). Ceto-vimutti is related to the practice of dhyana, while panna-vimutti is related to the development of insight. According to Gombrich, the distinction may be a later development, which resulted in a change of doctrine, regarding the practice of dhyana to be insufficient for final liberation.Gombrich, The Conditioned genesis of Buddhism, chapter four: \\"How Insight Worstened Concentration\\" With release comes Nirvana (Pali: Nibbana), ‚Äúblowing out‚Äù, \\"quenching\\", or ‚Äúbecoming extinguished‚Äù of the fires of the passions and of self-view.Gombrich, \\"What the Buddha thought\\" It is a \\"timeless state\\" in which there is no more becoming., Quote: \\"This general scheme remained basic to later Hinduism, to Jainism, and to Buddhism. Eternal salvation, to use the Christian term, is not conceived of as world without end; we have already got that, called samsara, the world of rebirth and redeath: that is the problem, not the solution. The ultimate aim is the timeless state of moksha, or as the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it, nirvana.\\" Nirvana ends the cycle of Dukkha and rebirth in the six realms of Sa·πÉsƒÅra (Buddhism). It is part of the Four Noble Truths doctrine of Buddhism, which plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism. Nirvana has been described in Buddhist texts in a manner similar to other Indian religions, as the state of complete liberation, enlightenment, highest happiness, bliss, fearless, freedom, dukkha-less, permanence, non-dependent origination, unfathomable, indescribable. It has also been described as a state of release marked by \\"emptiness\\" and realization of non-Self. Such descriptions, states Peter Harvey, are contested by scholars because nirvana in Buddhism is ultimately described as a state of \\"stopped consciousness (blown out), but one that is not non-existent\\", and \\"it seems impossible to imagine what awareness devoid of any object would be like\\".  Jainism  In Jainism, moksha and nirvana are one and the same.: \\"Moksa and Nirvana are synonymous in Jainism\\". p.168Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society Cambridge University Press. : \\"Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa.\\" p.297 Jaina texts sometimes use the term Kevalya, and call the liberated soul as Kevalin. As with all Indian religions, moksha is the ultimate spiritual goal in Jainism. It defines moksha as the spiritual release from all karma. Jainism is a Sramanic non-theistic philosophy, that like Hinduism and unlike Buddhism, believes in a metaphysical permanent self or soul often termed jiva. Jaina believe that this soul is what transmigrates from one being to another at the time of death. The moksa state is attained when a soul (atman) is liberated from the cycles of deaths and rebirths (sa·πÉsƒÅra), is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a siddha. In Jainism, it is believed to be a stage beyond enlightenment and ethical perfection, states Paul Dundas, because they can perform physical and mental activities such as teach, without accruing karma that leads to rebirth. Jaina traditions believe that there exist Abhavya (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain moksha (liberation). The Abhavya state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act, but Jaina texts also polemically applied Abhavya condition to those who belonged to a competing ancient Indian tradition called ƒÄjƒ´vika. A male human being is considered closest to the apex of moksha, with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. The ability of women to attain moksha has been historically debated, and the subtraditions with Jainism have disagreed. In the Digambara tradition of Jainism, women must live an ethical life and gain karmic merit to be reborn as a man, because only males can achieve spiritual liberation. In contrast, the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara tradition has believed that women too can attain moksha just like men. According to Jainism, purification of soul and liberation can be achieved through the path of three jewels: Samyak dar≈õana (Correct View), meaning faith, acceptance of the truth of soul (jƒ´va); Samyak jnana (Correct Knowledge), meaning undoubting knowledge of the tattvas; and Samyak charitra (Correct Conduct), meaning behavior consistent with the Five vows. Jain texts often add samyak tap (Correct Asceticism) as a fourth jewel, emphasizing belief in ascetic practices as the means to liberation (moksha). The four jewels are called moksha marg. According to Jain texts, the liberated pure soul (Siddha) goes up to the summit of universe (Siddhashila) and dwells there in eternal bliss.  Sikhism  The Sikh concept of mukti (moksha) is similar to other Indian religions, and refers to spiritual liberation. It is described in Sikhism as the state that breaks the cycle of rebirths.Geoff Teece (2004), Sikhism: Religion in focus, , page 17 Mukti is obtained according to Sikhism, states Singha, through \\"God's grace\\".HS Singha (2009),Sikhism: A Complete Introduction, Hemkunt Press, , pages 53-54 According to the Guru Granth Sahib, the devotion to God is viewed as more important than the desire for Mukti. Sikhism recommends Naam Simran as the way to mukti, which is meditating and repeating the Naam (names of God).

The most common forms are religious persecution, racism and political persecution, though there is naturally some overlap between these terms.

The suffering experienced by the victim must be sufficiently severe. The threshold level of severity has been a source of much debate.S. Rempell, Defining Persecution, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941006 International law As part of the Nuremberg Principles, crimes against humanity are part of international law. Principle VI of the Nuremberg Principles states that Telford Taylor, who was Counsel for the Prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials wrote \\"[at] the Nuremberg war crimes trials, the tribunals rebuffed several efforts by the prosecution to bring such 'domestic' atrocities within the scope of international law as 'crimes against humanity'\\".Telford Taylor \\"When people kill a people\\", The New York Times, March 28, 1982. Several subsequent international treaties incorporate this principle, but some have dropped the restriction \\"in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime\\" that is in Nuremberg Principles. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which is binding on 111 states, defines crimes against humanity in Article 7.1. The article criminalises certain acts \\"committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack\\". These include: Religious Religious persecution is systematic mistreatment of an individual or group due to their religious affiliation. Not only theorists of secularization (who presume a decline of religiosity in general) would willingly assume that religious persecution is a thing of the past. However, with the rise of fundamentalism and religiously related terrorism, this assumption has become even more controversial. Indeed, in many countries of the world today, religious persecution is a Human Rights problem. =Atheists= Atheists have experienced persecution throughout history. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beating, torture, or execution. It also may refer to the confiscation or destruction of property. =Bah√° º√≠s= The persecution of Bah√° º√≠s refers to the religious persecution of Bah√° º√≠s in various countries, especially in Iran, which has the seventh largest Bah√° º√≠ population in the world, with just over 251,100 as of 2010. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith originated in Iran, and it represents the largest religious minority in that country. =Christians= A Christian Dirce, by Henryk Siemiradzki. A Christian woman is martyred under Nero in this re- enactment of the myth of Dirce (painting by Henryk Siemiradzki, 1897, National Museum, Warsaw). The persecution of Christians is religious persecution that Christians may undergo as a consequence of professing their faith, both historically and in the current era. Early Christians were persecuted for their faith at the hands of both Jews from whose religion Christianity arose and the Roman Empire which controlled much of the land across which early Christianity was distributed. Early in the fourth century, the religion was legalized by the Edict of Milan, and it eventually became the State church of the Roman Empire. Christian missionaries, as well as the people that they converted to Christianity, have been the target of persecution, many times to the point of being martyred for their faith. There is also a history of individual Christian denominations suffering persecution at the hands of other Christians under the charge of heresy, particularly during the 16th century Protestant Reformation as well as throughout the Middle Ages when various Christian groups deemed heretical were persecuted by the Papacy. In the 20th century, Christians have been persecuted by various groups, and by atheistic states such as the USSR and North Korea. During the Second World War members of many Christian churches were persecuted in Germany for resisting the Nazi ideology. In more recent times the Christian missionary organization Open Doors (UK) estimates 100 million Christians face persecution, particularly in Muslim-dominated countries such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.Open Doors: The worst 50 countries for persecution of Christians Open Doors: Weltverfolgungsindex 2012 , p. 2 According to the International Society for Human Rights, up to 80% of all acts of persecution are directed against people of the Christian faith. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism) With the Missouri extermination order Mormons became the only religious group to have a state of the United States legalize the extermination of their religion. This was after a speech given by Sidney Rigdon called the July 4th Oration which while meant to state that Mormons would defend their lives and property was taken as inflammatory. Their forcible expulsion from the state caused the death of over a hundred due to exposure, starvation, and resulting illnesses. The Mormons suffered through tarring and feathering, their lands and possessions being repeatedly taken from them, mob attacks, false imprisonments, and the US sending an army to Utah to deal with the \\"Mormon problem\\" in the Utah War which resulted in a group of Mormons lead by John D. Lee massacring settlers at the Mountain Meadows Massacre. A government militia slaughtered Mormons in what is now known as the Haun's Mill massacre. The founder of the church, Joseph Smith, was killed in Carthage, Illinois by a mob of about 200 men, almost all of whom were members of the Illinois state militia including some members of the militia who were assigned to guard him. Jehovah's Witnesses Throughout the history of Jehovah's Witnesses, their beliefs, doctrines and practices have engendered controversy and opposition from local governments, communities, and mainstream Christian groups. =Falun Gong= Falun Gong was introduced to the general public by Li Hongzhi in Changchun, China, in 1992. For the next few years, Falun Gong was the fastest growing qigong practice in Chinese history and, by 1999, there were millions of practitioners. Following the seven years of widespread popularity, on July 20, 1999, the government of the People's Republic of China began a nationwide persecution campaign against Falun Gong practitioners, except in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.Faison, Seth (April 27, 1999) \\"In Beijing: A Roar of Silent Protesters\\" New York Times, retrieved June 10, 2006Kahn, Joseph (April 27, 1999) \\"Notoriety Now for Exiled Leader of Chinese Movement\\" New York Times, retrieved June 14, 2006 In late 1999, legislation was created to outlaw \\"heterodox religions\\" and retroactively applied to Falun Gong.Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 ‚Äì 784 Amnesty International states that the persecution is \\"politically motivated\\" with \\"legislation being used retroactively to convict people on driven charges, and new regulations introduced to further restrict fundamental freedoms\\".The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called heretical organizations , The Amnesty International =Hindus= Persecution of Hindus refers to the religious persecution inflicted upon Hindus that may undergo as a consequence of professing their faith, both historically and in the current era. Hindus have been brutally persecuted during the historical Islamic rule of the Indian subcontinent and during Portuguese rule of Goa. Even in modern times, Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh have suffered persecution. Most recently, thousands of Hindus from Sindh province in Pakistan have been fleeing to India voicing fear for their safety. After the Partition of India in 1947, there were 8.8 million Hindus in Pakistan (excluding Bangladesh) in 1951. In 1951, Hindus constituted 22% of the Pakistani population (including present-day Bangladesh which formed part of Pakistan).Census of Pakistan, 1951Hindu Masjids by Prafull Goradia, 2002 \\"In 1951, Muslims were 77 percent and Hindus were 22 percent.\\" Today, the Hindu minority amounts to 1.7 percent of Pakistan's population.Census of Pakistan The Bangladesh Liberation War (1971) resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in Time magazine dated 2 August 1971, stated \\"The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred.\\" Senator Edward Kennedy wrote in a report that was part of United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations testimony dated 1 November 1971, \\"Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, mass rape and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked \\"H\\". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad\\". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and World Health Organization the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. In a syndicated column \\"The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored\\", Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Sydney Schanberg wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. \\"Other reminders were the yellow \\"H\\"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army\\" (by \\"Muslim army\\", meaning the Pakistan Army, which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), (Newsday, 29 April 1994). In Bangladesh, on 28 February 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, the Vice President of the Jamaat-e-Islami to death for the war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Following the sentence, activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir attacked the Hindus in different parts of the country. Hindu properties were looted, Hindu houses were burnt into ashes and Hindu temples were desecrated and set on fire. The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu homes, the rape of Hindu women, and the desecration and destruction of, according to community leaders, more than 50 Hindu temples; 1,500 Hindu homes were destroyed in 20 districts. While the government has held the Jamaat-e-Islami responsible for the attacks on the minorities, the Jamaat-e-Islami leadership has denied any involvement. The minority leaders have protested the attacks and appealed for justice. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has directed the law enforcement to start suo motu investigation into the attacks. US Ambassador to Bangladesh express concern about attack of Jamaat on Bengali Hindu community. =Jews= Kaunas pogrom in German-occupied Lithuania, June 1941 Persecution of Jews is a recurring phenomenon throughout Jewish history. It has occurred on numerous occasions and in widely different geographical locations. It may include pogroms, looting and demolition of private and public Jewish property (e.g., Kristallnacht), unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, torture, killing, or even mass execution (in World War II alone, approximately 7 million people were deliberately killed only for being Jewish). They have been expelled from their hometowns/countries, hoping to find havens in other polities. In recent times anti-Semitism has often been manifested as Anti-Zionism,New antisemitism despite the fact that there are various Jewish groups whose members themselves oppose the idea of Zionism.Anti-Zionism#Jewish anti-Zionism =Muslims= Mass grave where events of the Srebrenica massacre of Bosnian Muslims unfolded The persecution of Muslims has been a recurring phenomenon throughout the history of Islam. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beatings, torture, or execution. It may also refer to the confiscation or destruction of property, or incitement to hate Muslims. Persecution can extend beyond those who perceive themselves to be Muslims and include those who are perceived by others as Muslims, or it can include Muslims who are considered non-Muslims by fellow Muslims. The Ahmadiyya regard themselves as Muslims, but are seen by many other Muslims as non-Muslims and \\"heretics\\". In 1984, the Government of Pakistan, under General Zia-ul-Haq, passed Ordinance XX, which banned proselytizing by Ahmadis and also banned Ahmadis from referring to themselves as Muslims. According to this ordinance, any Ahmadi who refers to oneself as a Muslim by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, directly or indirectly, or makes the call for prayer as other Muslims do, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. Because of these difficulties, Mirza Tahir Ahmad migrated to London. =Sikhs= The 1984 anti-Sikh riots or the 1984 Sikh Massacre was a series of pogromsState pogroms glossed over. The Times of India. 31 December 2005. directed against Sikhs in India, by anti- Sikh mobs, in response to the assassination of Indira Gandhi, on 31 October 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards in response to her actions authorising the military operation Operation Blue Star. There were more than 8,000 deaths, including 3,000 in Delhi. In June 1984, during Operation Blue Star, Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to attack the Golden Temple and eliminate any insurgents, as it had been occupied by Sikh separatists who were stockpiling weapons. Later operations by Indian paramilitary forces were initiated to clear the separatists from the countryside of Punjab state. The Indian government reported 2,700 deaths in the ensuing chaos. In the aftermath of the riots, the Indian government reported 20,000 had fled the city, however the People's Union for Civil Liberties reported \\"at least\\" 1,000 displaced persons. The most affected regions were the Sikh neighbourhoods in Delhi. The Central Bureau of Investigation, the main Indian investigating agency, is of the opinion that the acts of violence were organized with the support from the then Delhi police officials and the central government headed by Indira Gandhi's son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as Prime Minister after his mother's death and, when asked about the riots, said \\"when a big tree falls, the earth shakes\\" thus trying to justify the communal strife. There are allegations that the government destroyed evidence and shielded the guilty. The Asian Age front-page story called the government actions \\"the Mother of all Cover-ups\\" There are allegations that the violence was led and often perpetrated by Indian National Congress activists and sympathisers during the riots. The chief weapon used by the mobs, kerosene, was supplied by a group of Indian National Congress Party leaders who owned filling stations. Ethnic Ethnic persecution refers to perceived persecution based on ethnicity. Its meaning is parallel to that of racism, (based on race). The Rwandan genocide remains an atrocity that the indigenous Hutu and Tutsi peoples still believe is unforgivable. The Japanese occupation of China caused the death of millions of people, mostly peasants who were murdered after the Doolittle Raid in early-World War II. =Germans= The persecution of ethnic Germans refers to systematic activity against groups of ethnic Germans based on their ethnicity. Historically, this has been due to two causes: the German population was considered, whether factually or not, linked with German nationalist regimes such as those of the Nazis or Kaiser Wilhelm. This was the case in the World War I era persecution of Germans in the United States, and also in Eastern and Central Europe following the end of World War II. While many victims of these persecutions did not, in fact, have any connection to those regimes, cooperation between German minority organisations and Nazi regime did occur, as the example of Selbstschutz shows, which is still used as a pretense of hostilities against those who did not take part in such organisations. After World War II, many such Volksdeutsche were killed or driven from their homes in acts of vengeance, others in ethnic cleansing of territories prior to populating them with citizens of the annexing country. In other cases (e.g. in the case of the formerly large German-speaking populations of Russia, Estonia, or the Transylvanian (Siebenb√ºrgen) German minority in Rumania and the Balkans) such persecution was a crime committed against innocent communities who had played no part in the Third Reich. =Hazara people= The Hazara people of central Afghanistan have been persecuted by Afghan rulers at various times in the history. Since the tragedy of 9/11, Sunni Muslim terrorists have been attacking the Hazara community in southwestern Pakistani town of Quetta, home to some 500,000 Hazara who fled persecution in neighbouring Afghanistan. Some 2,400 men, women and children have been killed or wounded with Lashkar-e- Jhangvi claiming responsibility for most of the attacks against the community. Consequently, many thousands have fled the country seeking asylum in Australia. =Roma= Antiziganism is hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed against the Romani people as an ethnic group, or people who are perceived as being of Romani heritage. The Porajmos was the planned and attempted effort, often described as a genocide, during World War II by the government of Nazi Germany and its allies to exterminate the Romani (Gypsy) people of Europe. Under the rule of Adolf Hitler, a supplementary decree to the Nuremberg Laws was issued on 26 November 1935, defining Gypsies as \\"enemies of the race-based state\\", the same category as Jews. Thus, the fate of Roma in Europe in some ways paralleled that of the Jews. Historians estimate that 220,000 to 500,000 Romani were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators, or more than 25% of the slightly less than 1 million Roma in Europe at the time. Ian Hancock puts the death toll as high as 1.5 million. =Rohingyas= The UN human rights chief slammed Myanmar's apparent \\"systematic attack\\" on the Rohingya minority, warning that \\"ethnic cleansing\\" seemed to be underway. Ethnic Rohingya Muslims fleeing security forces in Myanmar‚Äôs Rakhine State have described killings, shelling, and arson in their villages that have all the hallmarks of a campaign of ‚Äúethnic cleansing,‚Äù Human Rights Watch said. ‚ÄúRohingya refugees have harrowing accounts of fleeing Burmese army attacks and watching their villages be destroyed,‚Äù said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director. ‚ÄúLawful operations against armed groups do not involve burning the local population out of their homes.‚Äù http://www.thedailystar.net/world/south-asia/atrocities-rohingyas-myanmar- have-hallmarks-ethnic-cleansing-hrw-1459276 =Sri Lankan Tamils= Widespread attacks on Sri Lankan Tamils came in the form of island wide ethnic riots, including The 1958 anti-Tamil pogrom and the Black July riots. Further persecution through murders, targeted rape and kidnapping occurred. Whilst previously, the majority of Tamils demanded instead for a separate state, by 1983 armed struggles against Sinhalese extremists began to rise, culminating in the formation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Based on genetics =People with albinism= Persecution on the basis of albinism is frequently based on the belief that albinos are inferior to persons with higher concentration of melanin in their skin. As a result, albinos have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinistic people dug up and desecrated. Such people have also been ostracized and even killed because they are presumed to bring bad luck in some areas. Haiti also has a long history of treating albinistic people as accursed, with the highest incidence under the influence of Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier. Of people with autism People with autism spectrum disorders have commonly been victims of persecution, both throughout history and in the present era. In Cameroon children with autism are commonly accused of witchcraft and singled out for torture and even death. Additionally, it is speculated that many of the disabled children murdered during Action T4 in Nazi Germany may have been autistic, making autistic people among the first victims of The Holocaust. LGBT A number of countries, especially those in the Western world, have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the United Nations passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights and, in 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized in all states of the United States. Based on military service Persecution on the basis of army service (or the lack of it) operates in Israeli society. In the State of Israel, Jewish citizens who receive an exemption from service in the Israel Defense Forces cannot take up many prestigious career options, especially in the field of security. The root of discrimination on the basis of army service lies in the practice that at age 17, non-Arab citizens (including Druze) are called up to be examined for eligibility to compulsory military service. A record for each potential conscript is made. Those who actually serve in the military are distinguished from those rejected from service by a Discharge Card, which has additional information on it, including the soldier's rank, military profession, and behavior during army service. Potential employers show a particular interest in Discharge Cards, since they constitute a universally available source of information about a potential employee. Employers frequently look down upon citizens rejected from the army, typically believing that \\"those who are unfit for army service are also unfit for the work environment\\", and that those who succeeded in the army are also likely to become good employees. Job advertisements in Israel very frequently specify a requirement of \\"Full Army Service\\", thus the decisions taken by the draft board regarding a 17-year-old minor may affect entire careers. In fiction, Robert A. Heinlein depicts a society where suffrage rights depend on military service in his 1959 novel Starship Troopers.

Early life  On December 11, 1889, Knott was born in San Bernardino, California. Knott's father was Elgin Charles Knott, a Reverend originally from Tennessee. Knott's mother was Margaret Virginia Daugherty.Nygaard, Norman E., Walter Knott: Twentieth Century Pioneer, pp. 93‚Äì100, Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, MI, 1965. Knott grew up in Pomona, California.  Career  In the 1920s, Knott was a somewhat unsuccessful farmer whose fortunes changed when he nursed several abandoned berry plants back to health. The hybrid boysenberry, named after its creator, Rudolph Boysen, was a cross between a blackberry, red raspberry and loganberry. The huge berries were a hit, and the Knott family sold berries, preserves and pies from a Buena Park, California roadside stand. In 1934, Knott's wife Cordelia (n√©e Hornaday, January 23, 1890 ‚Äì April 12, 1974) began serving fried chicken dinners, and within a few years, lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long.Merritt, Christopher and Lynxwiler, J. Eric, Knott's Preserved: From Boysenberry to Theme Park, the History of Knott's Berry Farm, pp. 20‚Äì31, Angel City Press, Santa Monica, CA, 2010. To entertain the waiting crowds, Walter built a Ghost Town in 1940, using buildings relocated from Old West towns. In 1940 Walter sent his son Russel to Twentynine Palms, California. Russel was helped by a local resident Daniel F. Leahy who took Russel to the Old Calico Ghost Town in the hills just northeast of Twentynine Palms. \\"Very soon after this visit Walter purchased a number of Calico's buildings. There were carefully disassembled, trucked, and reassembled in Buena Park.\\" (see pages 160-161 in For Those Who Served by Michael H. Pazeian). Even after Disneyland opened in 1955 only away, Knott's Berry Farm continued to thrive. Walt Disney and Walter Knott are rumored to have had a cordial relationship; it is known that they each visited the other's park, and they were both members of the original planning council for Children's Hospital of Orange County. Early additions to the farm included the Ghost Town & Calico Railroad, a narrow gauge railroad in the Ghost Town area, a San Francisco cable car, a Pan-for- Gold attraction, the Calico Mine Train dark ride and the Timber Mountain Log Ride log flume ride. In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged admission for the first time, and Knott's Berry Farm officially became an amusement park.Holmes, Roger and Bailey, Paul, Fabulous Farmer: The Story of Walter Knott and his Berry Farm, pp. 125‚Äì52, Westernlore Press, Los Angeles, CA, 1956. Ronald Reagan speaking at the Knotts' 60th wedding anniversary in 1971 Because of his interest in American pioneer history, Knott purchased and restored the real silver mining ghost town of Calico, California in 1951. As a child, Walter spent a lot of time in Calico living with his uncle. During World War I he helped to build a silver mill in Calico. This period in his life influenced his decision to buy the town and restore it. In 1966, he deeded Calico to San Bernardino County, California.Kooiman, Helen, Walter Knott: Keeper of the Flame, pp. 153‚Äì58, Plycon Press, Fullerton, CA, 1973.

They had four children, Virginia, Russell, Rachel, and Marion. On April 12, 1974 Knott's wife died in Buena Park, California. On December 3, 1981, just 8 days shy of his 92nd birthday, Knott died from Parkinson's disease in his home in Buena Park, California. He was 91 years old.

It was created by the writer Terry Nation as the home planet of the Daleks. In The Daleks (1963‚Äì64), Skaro is described as being the twelfth planet from its sun, while in Genesis of the Daleks (1975) it is stated that Skaro is situated in the \\"Seventh Galaxy\\". It is portrayed as having various moons: Flidor, Falkus and Omega Mysterium, with Falkus being presented as an artificial construct created by the Daleks as a last refuge. Falkus and Omega Mysterium are also referenced in the Big Finish Productions I, Davros audio dramas I, Davros: Innocence (2006) and I, Davros: Purity (2006). In Destiny of the Daleks (1979) the Movellans refer to Skaro as D‚Äì5‚ÄìGamma‚ÄìZ‚ÄìAlpha. Geography The Dalography of Skaro as illustrated in The Dalek Book (1964) The BBC-licensed The Dalek Book (1964) includes a map entitled \\"The Dalography of Skaro\\" on which three continents are shown; Dalazar, Darren and Davius. Dalazar is described as the most habitable part of Skaro, having a subtropical climate and being the location of the Dalek city. To the south-east is the Lake of Mutations and to the south the Drammankins mountain range, which stretches across the entire continent from the east to west coast. To the north-east Dalazar is joined to the continent of Darren by a land bridge. Darren is indicated to be the site of the neutron bomb explosion which transformed the Daleks from their humanoid form into mutants. The north and south regions are separated by the \\"Radiation Range\\" mountains. The third continent, Davius, is shown divided into east and west regions by the \\"River of Whirling Waters\\", with the eastern region being identified as the home of the Thals. Five seas are shown; the Ocean of Ooze, Sea of Acid, Sea of Rust, Serpent Sea and the land-locked Bottomless Sea. Other major features are the Island of Moving Mountains and an island chain named the Forbidden Islands, both situated in the Ocean of Ooze, and the Island of Gushing Gold located in the Sea of Rust. The BBC-Licensed The Dalek Outer Space Book (1966) confirms some of these details in a cutaway illustration entitled \\"The Strata of Skaro\\". A sea called The Ocean of Death is added, together with the Islands of Mist which, from the description, is an alternative name for the Dalek Book's Forbidden Islands. Further information is added by the 1977 Dalek Annual article \\"The Dark Side of Skaro\\", which mentions the Crystal Continent, Serpent Island and a feature called The Rocks, consisting of stone needles projecting thousands of feet high out of the sea and populated by gigantic flying creatures. Other areas listed are a prison colony, a region populated by the mutated descendants of prisoners used in early Dalek neutron weapon tests and The Swamp Lands, described as possibly being a vast, living organism that engulfs and feeds upon anything coming near its surface. Other Skarosian geographical features are mentioned in the TV21 comic strip The Daleks (1965-1967). In the story \\"Duel of the Daleks\\" an acid river and mercury geysers appear. In \\"Legacy of Yesteryear\\" a desert area called Tarran, volcanic plains and a northern polar region are portrayed, the latter area stated to have been created when the explosion of the Daleks‚Äô neutron bomb shifted the planet on its axis. The novelisation of Remembrance of the Daleks (1990) states that the Dalek city is called Mensvat Esc-Dalek and is located in the Vekis Nar-Kangji (Plain of Swords). In the computer game Doctor Who Adventure Game \\"City of the Daleks\\" (2010) the Dalek city is named Kaalann. Flora In most media, Skaro is portrayed as a nuclear wasteland and almost entirely devoid of plant life, with only a petrified forest located close to the Dalek city. Several exceptions are mentioned, however. Varga plants, resembling large, motile cacti studded with poisonous thorns, are seen in Mission to the Unknown (1965). Native to Skaro, they have been deliberately mutated by the Daleks to act as sentries and deter other life forms from interfering with their activities. An individual poisoned by the thorns develops an urge to kill and eventually transforms into another Varga plant. The Arkellis flower is described as being rare and only able to root in metal, with its sap being a constituent of the Golden Emperor Dalek‚Äôs metallic casing. In the TV21 comic strip The Daleks, dense undergrowth is depicted on several occasions, most notably in the mercury geyser swamps and the mutated forest. Fauna The Doctor Who television programme has shown only a few examples of Skaro's native wildlife. In The Daleks, a small, dead reptilian creature with long teeth, a pointed snout and pliable metal skin is discovered, the First Doctor surmising that its body is held together by a magnetic field. This is later identified by a Thal as a \\"Magnedon\\". (In the 1965 film Dr. Who and the Daleks, which is based upon The Daleks television serial, this creature is portrayed as a rather larger, petrified, dragon-like animal). A multi-tentacled creature with two luminous eyes is also shown inhabiting the Lake of Mutations. A large, aggressive, tentacled animal called a \\"Slyther\\" appears in The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964). It is described as the Black Dalek‚Äôs \\"pet\\" and is used to patrol the Dalek mine workings. Giant land-based clams, capable of crushing bone, are seen in Genesis of the Daleks (1975). They are described as being the discarded results of Davros‚Äô genetic experiments. In \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (2012) a flock of bird-like creatures are seen briefly, flying in the distance above the ruins of the Dalek City. Other media have introduced additional creatures. The Dalek Book's Dalography of Skaro states that vast serpents, mutated from earthworms by a neutron bomb explosion, live below the surface of the continent of Darren. The book also contains The Dalek Dictionary, which includes entries for \\"Lallapalange\\" (an extinct harmony bird which sang with two voices) and \\"Urvacryl\\" (a two-headed eel inhabiting the Lake of Mutations). Later, the TV21 \\"The Daleks\\" comic strip added giant eels,, Terrorkons (large aquatic creatures resembling wingless, two-headed dragons) and amorphous Sand Creatures. The Dalek Outer Space Book contains illustrations of several subterranean creatures including \\"Sponge People\\", a \\"Sucker\\" (resembling a red beetle), the tentacled Krakis and an unnamed squirrel-like animal. To this can be added yellow and black beetles and \\"rock leopards\\", mentioned in the novelisation of Remembrance of the Daleks. Sapient inhabitants In the television serial The Daleks two sapient, humanoid species are described as having existed on Skaro; the Dals, teachers and philosophers, and the Thals, a race of warriors. Radiation from a neutronic war caused both species to mutate. By the time of the story, the Thals are a blond-haired caucasian people, their physical mutation having come full circle. They have renounced violence and survive by farming. In contrast, the Dals have evolved into hideous, aggressive, xenophobic creatures which have encased themselves in protective metal shells and rely upon technology for survival. They now refer to themselves as Daleks. This evolution of the Dalek and Thal races is contradicted in the TV serial Genesis of the Daleks. The story depicts the Dalek progenitors as being a humanoid race called the Kaleds. They have been at war with the Thals for generations, turning Skaro into a wasteland devastated by chemical and nuclear weapons. While the Daleks and Thals have each engineered their own huge, protective dome in which to shelter, the disfigured victims of chemical and radioactive contamination are banished to roam the surface as \\"mutos\\". The Kaled scientists realise that the planet's toxic environment will eventually cause the mutation of their species, bringing their genetic purity to an end. Their chief scientist, Davros, decides to accelerate the mutation to find the ultimate Kaled form, in the process \\"improving\\" it by removing all traces of conscience, feeling and emotion. The resulting organisms are placed into armoured travel machines and referred to by Davros as Daleks. The TV Century 21 Dalek comic strip presents a different description of Skaro‚Äôs sapient life. One race, the Daleks, are depicted as short, blue-skinned, aggressive humanoids. They are engaged in a vicious war against the Thals who, although not shown in the strip, are described as tall, handsome, peaceful and living in constant fear of Dalek attack. The Daleks build a neutron bomb to finally bring the conflict to an end but a meteorite storm detonates the device prematurely, apparently destroying most of the life on Skaro. A mutated Dalek commandeers a prototype war machine, created shortly before the holocaust, to act as a mobile protective casing. It then convinces the last two humanoid Daleks, Yarvelling and Zolfian, to build more casings for the many other mutants which have survived. No further mention of the Thals is made in the strip, the implication being that they all perished in the nuclear conflagration. The Big Finish Productions I, Davros series of audio plays (2006) places the divergence of the Kaled and Thal species at a point 10 million years prior to the events depicted in Genesis of the Daleks and refers to two other species, the Tharons and the Dals, as both being extinct due to Kaled genocide by the time of the Kaled-Thal war. Fictional history The central plot device of the Doctor Who television programme, and of the Whoniverse, is time travel. Coupled with successive programme producers' and scriptwriters' uneven approach to continuity, attempts at imposing a strict chronology upon Skaro's fictional history are problematic. The events leading to the creation of the Daleks, as depicted in Genesis of the Daleks (1975), apparently pre-date those of The Daleks (1963‚Äì64) while in The Evil of the Daleks (1967), the story of which concludes with the apparent destruction of the Daleks due to a civil war on Skaro, the Second Doctor states that this is the creatures' \\"final end\\". In Destiny of the Daleks (1979), set many centuries after the events of Genesis of the Daleks, the Daleks return to an abandoned and still radioactive Skaro to retrieve their creator, Davros. In the subsequent serial Revelation of the Daleks (1985), the Daleks are shown to have re-occupied Skaro; those loyal to the Dalek Supreme travelling from there to capture Davros and destroy his new Dalek army on the planet Necros. Skaro's final appearance in the classic series is in the story Remembrance of the Daleks (1988), in which the Seventh Doctor tricks Davros and his Imperial Daleks into using a Time Lord device called the Hand of Omega on Skaro's sun to recreate the Gallifreyan time travel experiments. The Doctor sabotages the device, however, causing their sun to turn into a supernova which completely obliterates the planet. An image of Skaro is shown briefly at the start of the 1996 Doctor Who television movie, the narrative indicating that it is the site of a trial of the Master. No reference to the prior destruction of the planet is made. An attempt to explain this incongruity is made in the novel War of the Daleks (1997) in which, at the climax of the events portrayed in Remembrance of the Daleks, the Daleks manipulate Davros and the Seventh Doctor into destroying a planet called Antalin which they have terraformed to resemble Skaro and take its place. The novel further places the story Destiny of the Daleks on the disguised Antalin, and not Skaro. In the revived Doctor Who series, Skaro is referenced by the introduction of the Cult of Skaro in \\"Doomsday\\" (2006) and \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\" (2007), where the character Dalek Caan states that the planet is \\"gone... destroyed in a great war\\". Later, in the episode \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (2012), the Eleventh Doctor is lured to Skaro briefly. The planet is depicted as having been abandoned once again and is shown with a stormy, rain-swept red sky, the landscape filled with derelict structures and skyscrapers. This is consistent with the appearance of post-Time War Skaro as seen in the downloadable computer game City of the Daleks and an article written by Russell T Davies in the Doctor Who Annual 2006, which states that Skaro was devastated at the end of the Time War. Skaro appears in \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\" and \\"The Witch's Familiar\\" (2015), where Davros is shown first as an adolescent lost on a desert battlefield, and then having returned to the planet many years later to die with his \\"children\\", the Daleks. The planet has been made invisible and, when questioned by the Doctor, Davros states that the Daleks have rebuilt it. The Dalek Outer Space Book (1967) contains a chart entitled \\"The Evolution of Skaro\\" which traces the development of the planet from its creation, through various geological periods, to the advent of the Daleks. Other appearances Skaro is the setting for the feature film Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965), starring Peter Cushing. Although it is not named in the film, it is retroactively identified in its sequel, Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966). Skaro appears in the Big Finish Doctor Who audio stories The Mutant Phase (2000) and Davros (2003), and features prominently in the I, Davros spin-off series (2006), which focuses on Davros' life and the events that led to his creating the Daleks. Skaro makes an appearance in the Doctor Who: The Adventure Games episode \\"City of the Daleks\\". In the narrative the Daleks remove Skaro from the Time War, preventing its destruction. The Eleventh Doctor thwarts the Dalek's plan, negating the planet's survival and restoring the proper timeline. In April 2010 Piers Wenger, executive producer of Doctor Who at the time, stated that the games constitute \\"episodes\\" and form part of the Doctor Who universe. Exterior filming locations For Genesis of the Daleks exterior scenes supposedly taking place on Skaro were shot at Betchworth Quarry, Surrey and for Destiny of the Daleks at Winspit Quarry, Dorset. In \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\" and \\"The Witch's Familiar\\", exterior scenes set on Skaro were filmed in Tenerife.

He joined as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly before the departure of founder member Syd Barrett. Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the highest-selling and most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million in the United States.For 250 million records sold see: ; For 74.5 million RIAA certified units sold see: Following the departure of Roger Waters in 1985, Pink Floyd continued under Gilmour's leadership and released three more studio albums. Gilmour has produced a variety of artists, such as the Dream Academy, and has released four solo studio albums: David Gilmour, About Face, On an Island, and Rattle That Lock. He is also credited for bringing singer-songwriter Kate Bush to public attention. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2003, Gilmour was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution title at the 2008 Q Awards. In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 14 in their list of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was also voted number 36 in the greatest voices in rock by Planet Rock listeners in 2009. Gilmour has taken part in projects related to issues including animal rights, environmentalism, homelessness, poverty, and human rights. He has married twice and is the father of eight children. Early life and education David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England. His father, Douglas Gilmour, eventually became a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (n√©e Wilson), trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the BBC. At the time of Gilmour's birth they lived in Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, but in 1956, after several relocations, the family moved to nearby Grantchester.: the house in Trumpington; . Gilmour's parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, Bill Haley's \\"Rock Around the Clock\\". His enthusiasm was stirred the following year by Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", and later \\"Bye Bye Love\\" by the Everly Brothers piqued his interest in the guitar. He borrowed a guitar from a neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterward, Gilmour started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger. At age 11, Gilmour began attending Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he did not enjoy. There he met future Pink Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett and bassist Roger Waters, who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, also situated on Hills Road. In 1962, Gilmour began studying A-Level modern languages at the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology. Despite not finishing the course, he eventually learnt to speak fluent French. Barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour. In late 1962, Gilmour joined the blues rock band Jokers Wild. They recorded a one- sided album and a single at Regent Sound Studio, in west London, but only 50 copies of each were made. In August 1965, Gilmour busked around Spain and France with Barrett and some other friends, performing songs by the Beatles. They were arrested on one occasion and destitute, which resulted in Gilmour requiring treatment in a hospital for malnutrition.: arrested for busking; : malnutrition. He and Barrett later trekked to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the Louvre. During that time Gilmour worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for fashion designer Ossie Clark. Gilmour travelled to France in mid-1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson, formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the name Flowers, then Bullitt, but were not commercially successful. After hearing their covers of chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment. While in France, Gilmour contributed lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film Two Weeks in September, starring Brigitte Bardot. In May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new equipment. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record \\"See Emily Play\\" and was shocked to find that Barrett, who was beginning to suffer mental health problems, did not seem to recognise him. When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry onto the landing. Pink Floyd Gilmour performing with Pink Floyd in the mid-1970sIn December 1967, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason invited Gilmour to join the band to cover for the increasingly erratic Barrett. Gilmour accepted; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non- performing songwriter.: (primary source); : (secondary source). One of the band's business partners, Peter Jenner, said: \\"The idea was that Dave would ... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved.\\" By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult and he agreed to leave the band. Gilmour took up lead vocal roles with keyboardist Richard Wright. After the successes of The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and Wish You Were Here (1975), Waters took greater control of the band, writing and singing lead on most of Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). Wright was fired during the Wall sessions; the relationship between Gilmour and Waters deteriorated during the making of the Wall film and the album The Final Cut. The final Pink Floyd performance of The Wall took place on 17 June 1981, at Earl's Court, London, which became Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters for almost 25 years. The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of The Wall album and film, compounded by The Final Cuts virtually being a Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, About Face, in 1984. He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. Gilmour toured Europe and the US along with support act the Television Personalities, who were dropped from the line-up after Dan Treacy revealed Syd Barrett's address on stage. Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit. When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced the Dream Academy, who had a US top ten hit with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\" in 1986. = 1985: Gilmour becomes leader = In 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd were \\"a spent force creatively\\" and left the band. Gilmour and Mason responded with a press release stating that they intended to continue without him. Gilmour assumed control of the group and produced the Pink Floyd album A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987, with contributions from Mason and Richard Wright. He felt Pink Floyd albums had become too driven by lyrics under Waters' leadership, and attempted to \\"restore the balance\\" of music and lyrics on Momentary Lapse. It was followed by The Division Bell in 1994. In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat Astoria, moored it on the River Thames near Hampton Court and transformed it into a recording studio. The majority of the two Pink Floyd albums released about this time, as well as Gilmour's 2006 solo album On an Island, were recorded there.Gilmour in 1984 On 2 July 2005, Waters temporarily reunited with Gilmour to perform at Live 8. The performance caused a sales increase of Pink Floyd's album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. Gilmour donated his profits to charities that reflect the goals of Live 8, saying: \\"Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the G8 leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives.\\" He called upon all Live 8 artists to donate their extra revenue to Live 8 fundraising. After the concert, Pink Floyd turned down an offer to tour the US for ¬£150 million. In 2006, Gilmour said that Pink Floyd would likely never tour or write material again. He said: \\"I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I don't have the will to work as much any more. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life, I have had a wonderful time, but it's over. For me it's much less complicated to work alone.\\" In December 2006, Gilmour released a tribute to Barrett, who had died on 7 July of that year, in the form of his own version of Pink Floyd's first single \\"Arnold Layne\\". Recorded live at London's Royal Albert Hall, the single featured versions of the song performed by Wright and guest artist David Bowie. The single peaked on the UK Top 20 singles chart at number nineteen. Since their Live 8 appearance in 2005, Gilmour has repeatedly said that there will be no Pink Floyd reunion. With the death of Wright in September 2008, another reunion of the core group members became impossible. On 7 November 2014, Pink Floyd released The Endless River. Gilmour stated that it would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: \\"I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end.\\" There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was \\"kind of impossible\\" without Wright. In August 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were \\"done\\" and that to reunite without Wright \\"would just be wrong\\". Mason said in 2018 that Gilmour and Waters continued to be \\"at loggerheads\\" and argued over reissues: \\"I think the problem is Roger doesn‚Äôt really respect David. He feels that writing is everything, and that guitar playing and the singing are something that, I won‚Äôt say anyone can do, but that everything should be judged on the writing rather than the playing.\\"  Roy Harper  Gilmour has a long-standing association with Roy Harper, who was for a time managed by Pink Floyd's former managers Blackhill Enterprises, recorded for the same label, Harvest Records, and who appeared on the same bill as Pink Floyd at 1968's Midsummer High Weekend free concert in Hyde Park. Harper sang \\"Have a Cigar\\" on Pink Floyd's 1975 Wish You Were Here album, and sang the song with them at that year's Knebworth Festival. Gilmour played on Harper's albums HQ (1975), The Unknown Soldier (1980) and Once (1990). Five of the ten songs on the first of these were co-compositions, one of which, \\"Short and Sweet\\", was first recorded for Gilmour's first solo album. Another, \\"You\\", also features Kate Bush, as does the title track on Once. In April 1984, Harper made surprise guest appearance at Gilmour's Hammersmith Odeon gig to sing \\"Short and Sweet\\". This was included in Gilmour's Live 1984 concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmour's About Face album. While writing for About Face, Gilmour had a tune, and asked Pete Townshend of The Who to supply lyrics. This Townshend did, but Gilmour rejected them (Townshend would use both tune and lyrics, as \\"White City Fighting\\", on his 1985 White City: A Novel album, which features Gilmour on that track, and on Give Blood). Gilmour then asked Harper for lyrics, but rejected those also, deciding not to use the tune on the album after all. Eventually Harper used his version, \\"Hope\\", which has a markedly slower tempo, on his 1985 album with Jimmy Page, called Whatever Happened to Jugula?.  Kate Bush  In the 1970s, Gilmour received a copy of songwriter Kate Bush's demo tape from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of both families. Impressed, Gilmour paid for Bush, then 16, to record three professional demo tracks to present to record companies.Rolling Stone magazine, 8 February 1990, pp 21‚Äì2: \\"The Sensual Woman\\" by Sheila Rogers. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who went on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. Gilmour arranged for EMI executive Terry Slater to hear the tape,, Originally published in who signed her. Gilmour is credited as executive producer on two tracks on Bush's debut album The Kick Inside, including her second single \\"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\\". He performed backing vocals on \\"Pull Out the Pin\\" on her fourth album The Dreaming, and played guitar on \\"Love and Anger\\" and \\"Rocket's Tail\\" on her sixth, The Sensual World. In March 1987, Bush, known for rarely performing live, sang \\"Running Up That Hill\\" at The Secret Policeman's Third Ball with Gilmour on guitar. A three DVD set of The Secret Policeman's Balls benefit concerts, including their performance, was released in 2009. In 2002, she performed \\"Comfortably Numb\\", singing the part of the doctor, at Gilmour's concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Solo work Gilmour performing live in Brussels, Belgium on his About Face tour, 1984By the late 1970s, Gilmour had begun to think that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd. In 1978 he channelled his ideas into his first solo album, David Gilmour, which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting. Music written during the finishing stages of the album, but too late to be used, was incorporated into a song by Waters, which became \\"Comfortably Numb\\", included on The Wall. Gilmour has recorded four solo studio albums, all four of which have charted in the US Top 40: his first peaked at No. 29 in 1978, About Face peaked at No. 32 in 1984, On an Island peaked at No. 6 in 2006, and Rattle That Lock peaked at No. 5 in 2015. His live albums Live in Gdansk (2008) and Live at Pompeii (2017) peaked at number 26 and number 45, respectively. Taking time off from Pink Floyd's schedule, Gilmour also took up various roles as a record producer, sideman and sound engineer for acts including former bandmate Syd Barrett, Unicorn, Paul McCartney, Arcadia, Berlin, John Martyn, Grace Jones, Tom Jones, Elton John, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Seal, Sam Brown, Jools Holland, Kirsty MacColl, The Who, Pete Townshend, Supertramp, Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, Alan Parsons, Peter Cetera and various charity groups among others. In 1985, Gilmour played on Bryan Ferry's sixth album Boys and Girls, as well as the song \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" for the US release of the Ridley Scott‚ÄìTom Cruise film Legend. A music video for the latter was created, incorporating Ferry and Gilmour into footage from the film (released as a bonus on the 2002 \\"Ultimate Edition\\" DVD release). Later that year, Gilmour played with Ferry at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London; his first collaboration with Ferry's keyboardist Jon Carin, later to tour with Pink Floyd. =2000s= In 2001 and 2002, Gilmour performed a total of six acoustic solo concerts in London and Paris, along with a small band and choir, which was documented on the In Concert release. On 24 September 2004, he performed a three-song set at the Strat Pack concert at London's Wembley Arena, marking the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar. Gilmour performing in 2006 On 6 March 2006, Gilmour's 60th birthday, he released his third solo album, On an Island. It debuted at number 1 in the UK charts, and reached the top five in Germany and Sweden. The album earned Gilmour his first US top-ten as a solo artist, reaching number six in Billboard 200. Produced by Gilmour along with Phil Manzanera and Chris Thomas, the album features orchestrations by renowned Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner, and lyrics principally written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson. The album featured David Crosby and Graham Nash performing backing vocals on the title-track, Robert Wyatt on cornet and percussion, and Richard Wright on Hammond organ and providing backing vocals. Other contributors included Jools Holland, Georgie Fame, Andy Newmark, B. J. Cole, Chris Stainton, Willie Wilson, Rado 'Bob' Klose on guitar and Leszek Mo≈ºd≈ºer on piano. The album also featured Gilmour's debut with the saxophone. Gilmour toured Europe, US and Canada from 10 March to 31 May 2006 to promote On an Island. There were ten shows in the US and Canadian leg of the tour. Pink Floyd alumnus Richard Wright, and frequent Floyd collaborators Dick Parry, Guy Pratt, and Jon Carin also accompanied him on the tour. More shows took place in Europe from July to August in 2006. In a press release to promote the tour, Gilmour stated: \\"I'm rather hoping that with this tour announcement, people will believe me when I say, honestly, this is the only band I plan to tour with!\\" On 10 April 2006, On an Island was certified platinum in Canada, with sales of over 100,000 copies. A video recording of a show from Gilmour's solo tour, titled Remember That Night ‚Äì Live at the Royal Albert Hall, was released on 17 September 2007. The double DVD, directed by David Mallet, contains over five hours of footage, including an on-the-road documentary and guest appearances by David Bowie and Robert Wyatt. The final show of Gilmour's On an Island tour took place at the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard on 26 August 2006. The concert was held before a crowd of 100,000, and marked the twenty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the Solidarity trade union. The show was recorded, resulting in a live album and DVD release: Live in Gda≈Ñsk. For the occasion Gilmour performed with an orchestra, using the 38-piece string section of the Polish Baltic Philharmonic orchestra, conducted by Zbigniew Preisner. On 25 May 2009, he participated in a concert at the Union Chapel in Islington, London. The concert was part of the 'Hidden Gigs' campaign against hidden homelessness, which is organised by Crisis, a UK-based national charity campaigning against homelessness. In the concert he collaborated with the Malian musicians Amadou & Mariam. On 4 July 2009, he joined his friend Jeff Beck onstage at the Royal Albert Hall. Gilmour and Beck traded solos on \\"Jerusalem\\" and closed the show with \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\". In August 2009, he released an online single, \\"Chicago ‚Äì Change the World\\", on which he sang and played guitar, bass and keyboards, to promote awareness of the plight of Gary McKinnon. A re-titled cover of the Graham Nash song \\"Chicago\\", it featured Chrissie Hynde and Bob Geldof, plus McKinnon himself. It was produced by long-time Pink Floyd collaborator Chris Thomas. A video was also posted online. = 2010s ‚Äì present = Gilmour with drummer Nick Mason (left) at The O2, London, during The Wall Live, 12 May 2011. On 11 July 2010, Gilmour performed for the charity Hoping Foundation with Roger Waters in Oxfordshire, England. The performance was presented by Jemima Goldsmith and Nigella Lawson, and according to onlookers, it seemed that Gilmour and Waters had ended their long-running feud, laughing and joking together along with their respective partners. Waters subsequently confirmed on his Facebook page that Gilmour would play \\"Comfortably Numb\\" with him during one of his shows on his upcoming The Wall Live tour ‚Äì Gilmour performed the song with Waters on 12 May 2011 at The O2, London and, with Nick Mason, played with the rest of the band on \\"Outside the Wall\\" at the conclusion of the show. Gilmour released an album with the Orb in 2010 entitled Metallic Spheres, on which he co-wrote every track and their subsequent parts, and produced, played guitar and sang. In 2011, Rolling Stone placed Gilmour at number 14 in a list of the hundred greatest guitarists of all time. Graham Nash and Phil Taylor, Gilmour's guitar technician, both stated that Gilmour was working on a new studio album to be completed during 2014, featuring Nash along with his long-time collaborator David Crosby. On 29 October 2014, Gilmour told Rolling Stone magazine that his new album was \\"coming along very well\\", that \\"there's a few months work in it yet\\" and that he is \\"hoping to get it out this following year\\" (in 2015). In addition to the new album, Gilmour confirmed that there would also be a tour, but not a massive 200-date tour, more like an \\"old man's tour\\", adding: \\"There haven't been many discussions about the tour. But places like Radio City Music Hall sound like the right sort of vibe for me.\\" Gilmour performing in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during the Rattle That Lock Tour, 19 December 2015. Gilmour is playing \\"The Workmate\\", a well-worn Fender Esquire, with an added neck pickup. On 4 March 2015, Gilmour announced a tour of the UK and Europe planned from September to October 2015, his first live tour in nine years, coinciding with the release of his fourth solo studio album. On 16 July 2015, the first tour dates in 10 years were announced for North America for March to April 2016. On 6 June 2015, Gilmour previewed his fourth solo studio album at the Borris House Festival of Writing and Ideas in Carlow, Ireland and revealed that it would be titled Rattle That Lock. On 14 November 2015, Gilmour was the subject of the BBC Two documentary David Gilmour: Wider Horizons, which was billed as \\"an intimate portrait of one of the greatest guitarists and singers of all time, exploring his past and present.\\" Gilmour sings live in 2016 On 31 May 2017, it was announced that Gilmour's new live album and film, Live at Pompeii, which documents the two shows he performed on 7 and 8 July 2016 at the Amphitheatre of Pompeii, would be shown at selected cinemas, for one night only, on 13 September. The album was released on 29 September 2017 and peaked at Number 3 on the UK Albums Chart. To celebrate the event, Mayor Ferdinando Uliano, made Gilmour an honorary citizen of the city. In the EPK for Live at Pompeii, Gilmour stated that he has several songs which are almost complete which did not make it onto Rattle That Lock. He also stated that he would tour again when the next album is released. From April 2020, Gilmour appeared in a series of livestreams with his family, performing songs by Syd Barrett and Leonard Cohen. On 3 July he released \\"Yes, I Have Ghosts\\", his first single since 2015. Its lyrics were written by Samson and features his daughter Romany making her recording debut on backing vocals and harp. Musical style Gilmour credits guitarists such as Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, John Fahey, Roy Buchanan, and Hank Marvin of the Shadows as influences. Gilmour said: \\"I copied ‚Äì don‚Äôt be afraid to copy ‚Äì and eventually something that I suppose that I would call my own appeared.\\" In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown said his playing was \\"characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures\\". Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as an integral element of Pink Floyd's sound. Gilmour's lead guitar style is characterised by blues-influenced phrasing, expressive note bends, and sustain. In 2006, Gilmour said: \\"[My] fingers make a distinctive sound... [they] aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable.\\" Pink Floyd technician Phil Taylor said: \\"It really is just his fingers, his vibrato, his choice of notes and how he sets his effects ... In reality, no matter how well you duplicate the equipment, you will never be able to duplicate the personality.\\" Gilmour also plays bass, keyboards, banjo, lap steel, mandolin, harmonica, drums, and saxophone. According to an interview with Rock Compact Disc, he played bass on many Pink Floyd records, such as the fretless bass on \\"Hey You\\". Gilmour said: \\"Half the time I would play bass on the records because I would tend to do it quicker [than Waters] ... Rog used to come in and say 'thank you very much' to me once in a while for winning him bass-playing polls.\\" Influence According to MusicRadar, Gilmour is \\"a household name among the classic rock crowd, and for a lot of younger guitar fans he's the only 1970s guitarist that matters. For many he's the missing link between Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen.\\" Writing for the website, Billy Saefong stated Gilmour \\"isn't as flashy as Jimi Hendrix or Jimmy Page on the stage, but his guitar work outshines most for emotion.\\" In 1996, Gilmour was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. He has been ranked one of the greatest guitarists of all time by publications including Rolling Stone and The Daily Telegraph. In January 2007, Guitar World readers voted Gilmour's solos for \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\" among the top 100 greatest guitar solos. Gilmour is cited by Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery as one of his three main influences. John Mitchell, the guitarist of bands including It Bites and Arena, also cites Gilmour as an influence. In 2013, Gary Kemp, the guitarist and songwriter of Spandau Ballet (and also a member of Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets) argued that Gilmour's work on The Dark Side of the Moon \\"must make him the best guitar player in recent history\\". Charity work Gilmour has supported charities including Oxfam, the European Union Mental Health and Illness Association, Greenpeace, Amnesty International, the Lung Foundation, Nordoff-Robbins music therapy, Teenage Cancer Trust, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In May 2003, Gilmour sold his house in Little Venice to the ninth Earl Spencer and donated the proceeds worth ¬£3.6 million to Crisis to help fund a housing project for the homeless. He has been named a vice-president of the organisation. He donated ¬£25,000 to the Save the Rhino foundation in exchange for Douglas Adams's name suggestion for the album that became The Division Bell. On 20 June 2019, Gilmour auctioned 120 of his guitars for charity, at Christie's in New York, including his Black Strat, his #0001 and early 1954 Stratocasters, and his 1955 Les Paul. The Black Strat sold for $3,975,000, making it the most expensive guitar ever sold at auction. The auction raised $21,490,750, with the proceeds going to the environmentalist charity ClientEarth. Personal life alt=Gilmour's first marriage was to American- born model and artist Virginia \\"Ginger\\" Hasenbein, on 7 July 1975. The couple had four children: Alice (born 1976), Clare (born 1979), Sara (born 1983) and Matthew (born 1986). They originally attended a Waldorf School, but Gilmour called their education there \\"horrific\\". In 1994, he married writer Polly Samson. His best man was his teenage friend and Pink Floyd album artwork designer Storm Thorgerson. Gilmour and Samson have four children: Gilmour's adopted son Charlie (born 1989 to Samson and Heathcote Williams), Joe (born 1995), Gabriel (born 1997) and Romany (born 2002).: Romany, : Charlie, Joe and Gabriel. Charlie's voice can be heard on the telephone to Steve O'Rourke at the end of \\"High Hopes\\" from The Division Bell. Gabriel performed piano on the song \\"In Any Tongue\\" on the 2015 album Rattle That Lock, making his recording debut. In 2011, Charlie was jailed for 16 months for violent disorder during a London protest against tuition fees. Gilmour lives with his family on a farm near Wisborough Green, Sussex, and also has a home at Hove. He also spends time at his recording studio houseboat Astoria near Hampton Court. Gilmour is an experienced pilot and aviation enthusiast. Under the aegis of his company, Intrepid Aviation, he amassed a collection of historical aircraft. He later decided to sell the company, which he had started as a hobby, feeling that it was becoming too commercial for him to handle. In a BBC interview, he stated: Gilmour does not believe in an afterlife and is an atheist.Newsday, published 30 March 2006: \\"I'm an atheist, and I don't have any belief in an afterlife...\\"\\"The theme of the new album ‚Äì those Pink Floyd habits die hard ‚Äì is mortality. One song, 'This Heaven', reflects Gilmour's atheism\\". The Sunday Telegraph (London), 28 May 2006, Section Seven, Pg. 8. He has stated that he is left-wing. He said that his parents were \\"Proper Manchester Guardian readers ... Some of their friends went on the Aldermaston Marches. Mine never did to my knowledge, but they were both committed to voting for the Labour Party.\\" He described himself as a socialist, \\"even if I can't quite stick with party politics\\". In August 2014, Gilmour was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in the Scottish independence referendum. In May 2017, Gilmour endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He tweeted: \\"I'm voting Labour because I believe in social equality.\\" Gilmour's net worth is ¬£115 million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2018. Awards and honours Gilmour was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2003 Birthday Honours, \\"for services to music\\". The award was presented to him at Buckingham Palace, on 7 November that year. On 22 May 2008, he won the 2008 Ivor Novello Lifetime Contribution Award, recognising his excellence in music writing. Later that year, he was recognised for his outstanding contribution to music by the Q Awards. He dedicated his award to Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright, who died in September 2008. On 11 November 2009, Gilmour received an honorary doctorate from Anglia Ruskin University. Guitars In March 1967 Gilmour's parents gave him his first Fender guitar, a white Telecaster, for his 21st birthday. He would use this guitar, which had a white pickguard and a rosewood fretboard, when he joined Pink Floyd in 1968, with one of Syd Barrett's teles as a spare. =The Black Strat= Gilmour's \\"Black Strat\\" on display at the Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains exhibition.Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains exhibition label One of Gilmour's most iconic guitars is The Black Strat, a Fender Stratocaster that appeared in most Pink Floyd concerts and every Pink Floyd album from 1970 to 1983. The guitar was originally bought by Gilmour at Manny's Music in New York in 1970, after the band's US tour was prematurely cancelled due to the theft of all its equipment in New Orleans. The guitar, which originally had a rosewood fretboard and a white pickguard, underwent a number of modifications throughout its life until it adopted its distinctive form with a black pickguard and a maple neck. It was auctioned for charity in 2019 for $3.9 million, making it one of the most expensive guitars ever sold at auction. =Fender Black Strat Signature Stratocaster= In November 2006, Fender Custom Shop announced two reproductions of Gilmour's \\"Black Strat\\" for release on 22 September 2008. Phil Taylor, Gilmour's guitar tech, supervised this release and has written a book on the history of this guitar. The release date was chosen to coincide with the release of Gilmour's Live in Gda≈Ñsk album. Both guitars are based on extensive measurements of the original instrument, each featuring varying degrees of wear. The most expensive is the David Gilmour Relic Stratocaster which features the closest copy of wear on the original guitar. A pristine copy of the guitar is also made, the David Gilmour NOS Stratocaster. On 20 June 2019, the Black Strat sold at a Christie's charity auction for a price of US$3,975,000, becoming the most expensive guitar ever sold at that time. =The 0001 Strat= The 0001 Strat is a Fender Stratocaster with a white body, maple neck, three-way pick up selector and an unusual gold colour scratch plate and hardware. Gilmour bought it from guitar technician Phil Taylor, who had purchased it from Seymour Duncan. Gilmour used the guitar in the 2004 Strat Pack show that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster at Wembley Arena along with one of his Candy Apple Red Stratocasters (famous for their appearances with Gilmour from 1987 to 2004). It has the serial number 0001; however, prototypes had been constructed before this one. The origin of the guitar is unknown, and it is unknown whether it is the real 0001 Strat because the neck (which has the 0001 serial number on it) could have been taken off the original. The model was used as a spare and for slide guitar in subsequent years. In 2019, the 0001 Strat was sold at auction for $1,815,000, setting a new world auction record for a Stratocaster. Gilmour also owns an early 1954 Stratocaster, believed to predate Fender's commercial release of the model. =Other electric guitars= Along with the Fender models, Gilmour has also used a Gibson Les Paul goldtop model with P-90 pick- ups during recording sessions for The Wall and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. It was used for the guitar solo on \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\". Gilmour also plays a Gretsch Duo-Jet, a Gretsch White Falcon, and a \\"White Penguin\\". He played a Bill Lewis 24-fret guitar during the Meddle and Dark Side of the Moon recording sessions, and a Steinberger GL model which was his main guitar during A Momentary Lapse of Reason recording sessions. =Acoustics= Gilmour has used many acoustic guitars, including a Gibson Chet Atkins classical model, and a Gibson J-200 Celebrity, acquired from John Illsley of Dire Straits. Gilmour used several Ovation models including a Custom Legend 1619-4, and a Custom Legend 1613-4 nylon string guitar, both during The Wall recording sessions. Martin models used include a D-35, purchased in New York in 1971, and a D12-28 12-string. =Steel guitar= Gilmour playing lap steel guitar, 1977 Throughout his recording career Gilmour has added a different element to his guitar style with his use of steel guitars. A pair of Jedson steel guitars, as well as a Fender 1000 pedal steel, were used frequently in the early 1970s. Originally purchased from a pawn shop while Gilmour was in Seattle in 1970, the Jedson was used during recording of \\"One of These Days\\" from Meddle and \\"Breathe\\" and \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" from Dark Side of the Moon. Gilmour also owns a Fender Deluxe lap steel, which he used during The Division Bell tour in 1994. Gilmour also owns a Champ lap steel model. Along with the Fender steel models Gilmour has also used: a Gibson EH150, and two Jedson models: one red (1977-tuned D-G-D-G-B-E for \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Parts 6‚Äì9\\", 1987‚Äì2006: Tuned E-B-E-G-B-E for \\"High Hopes\\") and one blonde. He also uses a ZB steel model. Gilmour played pedal steel guitar on the album Blue Pine Trees by Unicorn. =Bass guitars= Gilmour has played the bass guitar both in the studio and onstage, and has played many bass models including: an Ovation Magnum, a Fender Bass VI, Fender Precision and Jazz bass models and a Charvel fretless (all used during The Wall recording sessions). During the 1991 Amnesty International concert Gilmour used a Music Man Fretless Stingray bass while conducting the house band and again during Spinal Tap's performance of \\"Big Bottom\\". =EMG DG20 Signature pickups= In 2004 EMG, Inc. released the DG20 Signature guitar pickup kit for the Fender Stratocaster. The set included three active pickups, an EXG Guitar Expander for increased treble and bass frequencies, and a SPC presence control to enhance earthiness and mid-range. The system came pre-wired on a custom 11-hole white pearl pickguard with white knobs. The kit was based on the configuration mounted on Gilmour's red Stratocaster during the Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell tours.

Front side bus (FSB) frequency (external clock) has been increased from 133 MHz to 148 MHz, and the CPU clock multiplier factor has been changed from 13.5 to 16.5. This corresponds to an overclocking of the FSB by 11.3% and of the CPU by 36%. In computing, overclocking is the practice of increasing the clock rate of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer. Commonly, operating voltage is also increased to maintain a component's operational stability at accelerated speeds. Semiconductor devices operated at higher frequencies and voltages increase power consumption and heat. An overclocked device may be unreliable or fail completely if the additional heat load is not removed or power delivery components cannot meet increased power demands. Many device warranties state that overclocking and/or over- specification voids any warranty, however there are an increasing number of manufacturers that will allow overclocking as long as performed (relatively) safely.  Overview  The purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component. Normally, on modern systems, the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem, such as the main processor or graphics controller, but other components, such as system memory (RAM) or system buses (generally on the motherboard), are commonly involved. The trade-offs are an increase in power consumption (heat), fan noise (cooling), and shortened lifespan for the targeted components. Most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer's control; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage. Overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin, with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user. Examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling, as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds. Also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals, as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds. While most modern devices are fairly tolerant of overclocking, all devices have finite limits. Generally for any given voltage most parts will have a maximum \\"stable\\" speed where they still operate correctly. Past this speed the device starts giving incorrect results, which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it. While in a PC context the usual result is a system crash, more subtle errors can go undetected, which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as data corruption (incorrectly calculated results, or worse writing to storage incorrectly) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks (general usage such as internet browsing and word processing appear fine, but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system). At this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed, but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output, as well as shorten the lifespan further. At some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power, the user's ability to cool the part, and the device's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves destructive failure. Overzealous use of voltage and/or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device's performance to the point of failure, or in extreme cases outright destroy it. The speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system, and what components are being overclocked by the user; benchmarks for different purposes are published. =Underclocking= Conversely, the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device, with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance. Reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow quieter operation, and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge. Some manufacturers underclock components of battery- powered equipment to improve battery life, or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency accordingly. Underclocking is almost always involved in the latter stages of Undervolting, which seeks to find the highest clock speed that a processor will stably operate at a given voltage. That is, while overclocking seeks to maximize clock speed with temperature and power as constraints, underclocking seeks to find the highest clock speed that a device can reliably operate at a fixed, arbitrary power limit. A given device may operate correctly at its stock speed even when undervolted, in which case underclocking would only be employed after further reductions in voltage finally destabilizes the part. At that point the user would need to determine if the last working voltage and speed have satisfactorily lowered power consumption for their needs ‚Äì if not then performance must be sacrificed ‚Äì a lower clock is chosen (the underclock) and testing at progressively lower voltages would continue from that point. A lower bound is where the device itself fails to function and/or the supporting circuitry cannot reliably communicate with the part. Underclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently (such as for a home entertainment center) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings. This would use a \\"standard-voltage\\" part and attempt to run with lower voltages (while attempting to keep the desktop speeds) to meet an acceptable performance/noise target for the build. This was also attractive as using a \\"standard voltage\\" processor in a \\"low voltage\\" application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version. However again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success, and the builder's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered. The usefulness of underclocking (again like overclocking) is determined by what processor offerings, prices, and availability are at the specific time of the build. Underclocking is also sometimes used when troubleshooting. =Enthusiast culture= Overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines. However, the practice is embraced more by enthusiasts than professional users, as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability, accuracy and damage to data and equipment. Additionally, most manufacturer warranties and service agreements do not cover overclocked components nor any incidental damages caused by their use. While overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity, and thus workflow productivity for professional users, the importance of stability testing components thoroughly before employing them into a production environment cannot be overstated. Overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts. Overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer, or at speeds only officially offered on specialized, higher-priced versions of the product. A general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high- end market first, then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market. If the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed, an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering. This can give insight on how over-the-horizon technologies will perform before they are officially available on the mainstream market, which can be especially helpful for other users considering if they should plan ahead to purchase or upgrade to the new feature when it is officially released. Some hobbyists enjoy building, tuning, and \\"Hot-Rodding\\" their systems in competitive benchmarking competitions, competing with other like- minded users for high scores in standardized computer benchmark suites. Others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line, and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model's stock performance. Another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons. Another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier, little is lost as it is already depreciated, and would have needed to be replaced in any case. =Components= Technically any component that uses a timer (or clock) to synchronize its internal operations can be overclocked. Most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components, such as, processors (a.k.a. CPU), video cards, motherboard chipsets, and RAM. Most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock (processor bus speed) by an internal multiplier within the processor (the CPU multiplier) to attain their final speed. Computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the CPU multiplier if that option is available, but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the bus clock. Some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks (such as a system clock) that influence the bus clock speed that, again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed. Most OEM systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the BIOS of the OEM's motherboard, which precludes overclocking (for warranty and support reasons). The same processor installed on a different motherboard offering adjustments will allow the user to change them. Any given component will ultimately stop operating reliably past a certain clock speed. Components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable, but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning, even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values. The maximum speed is determined by overclocking to the point of first instability, then accepting the last stable slower setting. Components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential. The end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available CPU multipliers, bus dividers, voltages; the user's ability to manage thermal loads, cooling techniques; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances, interaction with other components and the rest of the system. Considerations There are several things to be considered when overclocking. First is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate. Supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive voltage can permanently damage a component. In a professional production environment, overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required, the possibly reduced reliability, the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties, and the higher power consumption. If faster speed is required it is often cheaper when all costs are considered to buy faster hardware. = Cooling = High quality heat sinks are often made of copper. All electronic circuits produce heat generated by the movement of electric current. As clock frequencies in digital circuits and voltage applied increase, the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases. The relationship between clock frequencies and thermal design power (TDP) are linear. However, there is a limit to the maximum frequency which is called a \\"wall\\". To overcome this issue, overclockers raise the chip voltage to increase the overclocking potential. Voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly (proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit, for example); this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating. In addition, some digital circuits slow down at high temperatures due to changes in MOSFET device characteristics. Conversely, the overclocker may decide to decrease the chip voltage while overclocking (a process known as undervolting), to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal. Stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use; overclocked circuits can require more cooling, such as by powerful fans, larger heat sinks, heat pipes and water cooling. Mass, shape, and material all influence the ability of a heatsink to dissipate heat. Efficient heatsinks are often made entirely of copper, which has high thermal conductivity, but is expensive. Aluminium is more widely used; it has good thermal characteristics, though not as good as copper, and is significantly cheaper. Cheaper materials such as steel do not have good thermal characteristics. Heat pipes can be used to improve conductivity. Many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost. Interior of a water-cooled computer, showing CPU thumb Water cooling carries waste heat to a radiator. Thermoelectric cooling devices which actually refrigerate using the Peltier effect can help with high thermal design power (TDP) processors made by Intel and AMD in the early twenty-first century. Thermoelectric cooling devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an electric current through the plates. This method of cooling is highly effective, but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away, often by a convection-based heatsink or a water cooling system. Liquid nitrogen may be used for cooling an overclocked system, when an extreme measure of cooling is needed. Other cooling methods are forced convection and phase transition cooling which is used in refrigerators and can be adapted for computer use. Liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, and dry ice are used as coolants in extreme cases, such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system. In June 2006, IBM and Georgia Institute of Technology jointly announced a new record in silicon-based chip clock rate (the rate a transistor can be switched at, not the CPU clock rate) above 500 GHz, which was done by cooling the chip to using liquid helium. CPU Frequency World Record is 8.794 GHz as of November 2012. These extreme methods are generally impractical in the long term, as they require refilling reservoirs of vaporizing coolant, and condensation can form on chilled components. Moreover, silicon-based junction gate field-effect transistors (JFET) will degrade below temperatures of roughly and eventually cease to function or \\"freeze out\\" at since the silicon ceases to be semiconducting, so using extremely cold coolants may cause devices to fail. Submersion cooling, used by the Cray-2 supercomputer, involves sinking a part of computer system directly into a chilled liquid that is thermally conductive but has low electrical conductivity. The advantage of this technique is that no condensation can form on components. A good submersion liquid is Fluorinert made by 3M, which is expensive. Another option is mineral oil, but impurities such as those in water might cause it to conduct electricity. Amateur overclocking enthusiasts have used a mixture of dry ice and a solvent with a low freezing point, such as acetone or isopropyl alcohol. This cooling bath, often used in laboratories, achieves a temperature of ‚àí78 ¬∞C.Cooling baths ‚Äì ChemWiki. Chemwiki.ucdavis.edu. Retrieved on 2013-06-17. However, this practice is discouraged due to its safety risks; the solvents are flammable and volatile, and dry ice con cause frostbite (through contact with exposed skin) and suffocation (due to the large volume of carbon dioxide generated when it sublimes). = Stability and functional correctness = As an overclocked component operates outside of the manufacturer's recommended operating conditions, it may function incorrectly, leading to system instability. Another risk is silent data corruption by undetected errors. Such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications, device drivers, or the operating system. Overclocked use may permanently damage components enough to cause them to misbehave (even under normal operating conditions) without becoming totally unusable. A large-scale 2011 field study of hardware faults causing a system crash for consumer PCs and laptops showed a four to 20 times increase (depending on CPU manufacturer) in system crashes due to CPU failure for overclocked computers over an eight-month period. In general, overclockers claim that testing can ensure that an overclocked system is stable and functioning correctly. Although software tools are available for testing hardware stability, it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor. Achieving good fault coverage requires immense engineering effort; even with all of the resources dedicated to validation by manufacturers, faulty components and even design faults are not always detected. A particular \\"stress test\\" can verify only the functionality of the specific instruction sequence used in combination with the data and may not detect faults in those operations. For example, an arithmetic operation may produce the correct result but incorrect flags; if the flags are not checked, the error will go undetected. To further complicate matters, in process technologies such as silicon on insulator (SOI), devices display hysteresis--a circuit's performance is affected by the events of the past, so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same. Often, an overclocked system which passes stress tests experiences instabilities in other programs. In overclocking circles, \\"stress tests\\" or \\"torture tests\\" are used to check for correct operation of a component. These workloads are selected as they put a very high load on the component of interest (e.g. a graphically intensive application for testing video cards, or different math- intensive applications for testing general CPUs). Popular stress tests include Prime95, Everest, Superpi, OCCT, AIDA64, Linpack (via the LinX and IntelBurnTest GUIs), SiSoftware Sandra, BOINC, Intel Thermal Analysis Tool and Memtest86. The hope is that any functional-correctness issues with the overclocked component will show up during these tests, and if no errors are detected during the test, the component is then deemed \\"stable\\". Since fault coverage is important in stability testing, the tests are often run for long periods of time, hours or even days. An overclocked computer is sometimes described using the number of hours and the stability program used, such as \\"prime 12 hours stable\\". =Factors allowing overclocking= Overclockability arises in part due to the economics of the manufacturing processes of CPUs and other components. In many cases components are manufactured by the same process, and tested after manufacture to determine their actual maximum ratings. Components are then marked with a rating chosen by the market needs of the semiconductor manufacturer. If manufacturing yield is high, more higher-rated components than required may be produced, and the manufacturer may mark and sell higher-performing components as lower-rated for marketing reasons. In some cases, the true maximum rating of the component may exceed even the highest rated component sold. Many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones, while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical. Notably, higher clocks must always mean greater waste heat generation, as semiconductors set to high must dump to ground more often. In some cases, this means that the chief drawback of the overclocked part is far more heat dissipated than the maximums published by the manufacturer. Pentium architect Bob Colwell calls overclocking an \\"uncontrolled experiment in better-than-worst-case system operation\\". = Measuring effects of overclocking = Benchmarks are used to evaluate performance, and they can become a kind of \\"sport\\" in which users compete for the highest scores. As discussed above, stability and functional correctness may be compromised when overclocking, and meaningful benchmark results depend on the correct execution of the benchmark. Because of this, benchmark scores may be qualified with stability and correctness notes (e.g. an overclocker may report a score, noting that the benchmark only runs to completion 1 in 5 times, or that signs of incorrect execution such as display corruption are visible while running the benchmark). A widely used test of stability is Prime95, which has built-in error checking that fails if the computer is unstable. Using only the benchmark scores, it may be difficult to judge the difference overclocking makes to the overall performance of a computer. For example, some benchmarks test only one aspect of the system, such as memory bandwidth, without taking into consideration how higher clock rates in this aspect will improve the system performance as a whole. Apart from demanding applications such as video encoding, high-demand databases and scientific computing, memory bandwidth is typically not a bottleneck, so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used. Other benchmarks, such as 3DMark, attempt to replicate game conditions.  Manufacturer and vendor overclocking  Commercial system builders or component resellers sometimes overclock to sell items at higher profit margins. The seller makes more money by overclocking lower-priced components which are found to operate correctly and selling equipment at prices appropriate for higher-rated components. While the equipment will normally operate correctly, this practice may be considered fraudulent if the buyer is unaware of it. Overclocking is sometimes offered as a legitimate service or feature for consumers, in which a manufacturer or retailer tests the overclocking capability of processors, memory, video cards, and other hardware products. Several video card manufactures now offer factory- overclocked versions of their graphics accelerators, complete with a warranty, usually at a price intermediate between that of the standard product and a non-overclocked product of higher performance. It is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as CPU multiplier locking to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them. These measures are sometimes marketed as a consumer protection benefit, but are often criticized by buyers. Many motherboards are sold, and advertised, with extensive facilities for overclocking implemented in hardware and controlled by BIOS settings.Web page for a typical motherboard claiming overclocking support  CPU multiplier locking  CPU multiplier locking is the process of permanently setting a CPU's clock multiplier. AMD CPUs are unlocked in early editions of a model and locked in later editions, but nearly all Intel CPUs are locked and recent models are very resistant to unlocking to prevent overclocking by users. AMD ships unlocked CPUs with their Opteron, FX, Ryzen and Black Series line-up, while Intel uses the monikers of \\"Extreme Edition\\" and \\"K-Series.\\" Intel usually has one or two Extreme Edition CPUs on the market as well as X series and K series CPUs analogous to AMD's Black Edition. AMD has the majority of their desktop range in a Black Edition. Users usually unlock CPUs to allow overclocking, but sometimes to allow for underclocking in order to maintain the front side bus speed (on older CPUs) compatibility with certain motherboards. Unlocking generally invalidates the manufacturer's warranty, and mistakes can cripple or destroy a CPU. Locking a chip's clock multiplier does not necessarily prevent users from overclocking, as the speed of the front-side bus or PCI multiplier (on newer CPUs) may still be changed to provide a performance increase. AMD Athlon and Athlon XP CPUs are generally unlocked by connecting bridges (jumper-like points) on the top of the CPU with conductive paint or pencil lead. Other CPU models may require different procedures. Increasing front-side bus and/or northbridge/PCI clocks can overclock locked CPUs, but this throws many system frequencies out of sync, since the RAM and PCI frequencies are modified as well. One of the easiest ways to unlock older AMD Athlon XP CPUs was called the pin mod method, because it was possible to unlock the CPU without permanently modifying bridges. A user could simply put one wire (or some more for a new multiplier/Vcore) into the socket to unlock the CPU. More recently however, notably with Intel's Skylake architecture, Intel had a bug with the Skylake (6th gen Core) processors where the base clock could be increased past 102.7 MHz, however functionality of certain features would not work. Intel intended to block base clock (BCLK) overclocking of locked processors when designing the Skylake architecture to prevent consumers from purchasing cheaper components and overclocking to previously-unseen heights (since the CPU's BCLK was no longer tied to the PCI buses), however for LGA1151, the 6th generation \\"Skylake\\" processors were able to be overclocked past 102.7 MHz (which was the intended limit by Intel, and was later mandated through later BIOS updates). All other unlocked processors from LGA1151 and v2 (including 7th, 8th, and 9th generation) and BGA1440 allow for BCLK overclocking (as long as the OEM allows it), while all other locked processors from 7th, 8th, and 9th gen were not able to go past 102.7 MHz on the BCLK.  Advantages  * Higher performance in games, en-/decoding, video editing and system tasks at no additional direct monetary expense, but with increased electrical consumption and thermal output. * System optimization: Some systems have \\"bottlenecks\\", where small overclocking of one component can help realize the full potential of another component to a greater percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked. For instance: many motherboards with AMD Athlon 64 processors limit the clock rate of four units of RAM to 333 MHz. However, the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor clock rate (which is a base number times a CPU multiplier, for instance 1.8 GHz is most likely 9√ó200 MHz) by a fixed integer such that, at a stock clock rate, the RAM would run at a clock rate near 333 MHz. Manipulating elements of how the processor clock rate is set (usually adjusting the multiplier), it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount, around 5-10%, and gain a small increase in RAM clock rate and/or reduction in RAM latency timings. * It can be cheaper to purchase a lower performance component and overclock it to the clock rate of a more expensive component. * Extending life on older equipment (through underclocking/undervolting). Disadvantages = General = * Higher clock rates and voltages increase power consumption, also increasing electricity cost and heat production. The additional heat increases the ambient air temperature within the system case, which may affect other components. The hot air blown out of the case heats the room it's in. * Fan noise: High- performance fans running at maximum speed used for the required degree of cooling of an overclocked machine can be noisy, some producing 50 dB or more of noise. When maximum cooling is not required, in any equipment, fan speeds can be reduced below the maximum: fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15 dB.UK Health and Safety Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques Fan noise can be reduced by design improvements, e.g. with aerodynamically optimized blades for smoother airflow, reducing noise to around 20 dB at approximately 1 metre or larger fans rotating more slowly, which produce less noise than smaller, faster fans with the same airflow. Acoustical insulation inside the case e.g. acoustic foam can reduce noise. Additional cooling methods which do not use fans can be used, such as liquid and phase-change cooling. * An overclocked computer may become unreliable. For example: Microsoft Windows may appear to work with no problems, but when it is re- installed or upgraded, error messages may be received such as a \\"file copy error\\" during Windows Setup.Article ID: 310064 ‚Äì Last Review: May 7, 2007 ‚Äì Revision: 6.2 How to troubleshoot problems during installation when you upgrade from Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition to Windows XP Microsoft says this of errors in upgrading to Windows XP: \\"Your computer [may be] over- clocked.\\" Because installing Windows is very memory-intensive, decoding errors may occur when files are extracted from the Windows XP CD-ROM. * The lifespan of semiconductor components may be reduced by increased voltages and heat. * Warranties may be voided by overclocking. = Risks of overclocking = * Increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion, while an increase in voltage usually causes heat to increase exponentially. Excessive voltages or improper cooling may cause chip temperatures to rise to dangerous levels, causing the chip to be damaged or destroyed. * Exotic cooling methods used to facilitate overclocking such as water cooling are more likely to cause damage if they malfunction. Sub-ambient cooling methods such as phase-change cooling or liquid nitrogen will cause water condensation, which will cause electrical damage unless controlled; some methods include using kneaded erasers or shop towels to catch the condensation. = Limitations = Overclocking components can only be of noticeable benefit if the component is on the critical path for a process, if it is a bottleneck. If disk access or the speed of an Internet connection limit the speed of a process, a 20% increase in processor speed is unlikely to be noticed, however there are some scenarios where increasing the clock speed of a processor actually allows an SSD to be read and written to faster. Overclocking a CPU will not noticeably benefit a game when a graphics card's performance is the \\"bottleneck\\" of the game.  Graphics cards  The BFG GeForce 6800GSOC ships with higher memory and clock rates than the standard 6800GS. Graphics cards can also be overclocked. There are utilities to achieve this, such as EVGA's Precision, RivaTuner, AMD Overdrive (on AMD cards only), MSI Afterburner, Zotac Firestorm, and the PEG Link Mode on Asus motherboards. Overclocking a GPU will often yield a marked increase in performance in synthetic benchmarks, usually reflected in game performanceAlt+Esc  GTX 780 Overclocking Guide. It is sometimes possible to see that a graphics card is being pushed beyond its limits before any permanent damage is done by observing on-screen artifacts or unexpected system crashes. It is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat, clock rate, and/or voltage limits, however if seen when not overclocked, they indicate a faulty card. After a reboot, video settings are reset to standard values stored in the graphics card firmware, and the maximum clock rate of that specific card is now deducted. Some overclockers apply a potentiometer to the graphics card to manually adjust the voltage (which usually invalidates the warranty). This allows for finer adjustments, as overclocking software for graphics cards can only go so far. Excessive voltage increases may damage or destroy components on the graphics card or the entire graphics card itself (practically speaking). = Alternatives = Flashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a video card, without technically overclocking (but is much riskier than overclocking just through software). Flashing refers to using the firmware of a different card with the same (or sometimes similar) core and compatible firmware, effectively making it a higher model card; it can be difficult, and may be irreversible. Sometimes standalone software to modify the firmware files can be found, e.g. NiBiTor (GeForce 6/7 series are well regarded in this aspect), without using firmware for a better model video card. For example, video cards with 3D accelerators (most, ) have two voltage and clock rate settings, one for 2D and one for 3D, but were designed to operate with three voltage stages, the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two, serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2D to 3D operation mode. Therefore, it could be wise to set this middle- stage prior to \\"serious\\" overclocking, specifically because of this fallback ability; the card can drop down to this clock rate, reducing by a few (or sometimes a few dozen, depending on the setting) percent of its efficiency and cool down, without dropping out of 3D mode (and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings). Some cards have abilities not directly connected with overclocking. For example, Nvidia's GeForce 6600GT (AGP flavor) has a temperature monitor used internally by the card, invisible to the user if standard firmware is used. Modifying the firmware can display a 'Temperature' tab. Unlocking refers to enabling extra pipelines or pixel shaders. The 6800LE, the 6800GS and 6800 (AGP models only) were some of the first cards to benefit from unlocking. While these models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled, they share the same 16x6 GPU core as a 6800GT or Ultra, but pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled; the GPU may be fully functional, or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification. GPUs found to be fully functional can be unlocked successfully, although it is not possible to be sure that there are undiscovered faults; in the worst case the card may become permanently unusable.  History  Overclocked processors first became commercially available in 1983, when AMD sold an overclocked version of the Intel 8088 CPU. In 1984, some consumers were overclocking IBM's version of the Intel 80286 CPU by replacing the clock crystal.

However, the term most often refers to the symmetric scale composed of alternating whole and half steps, as shown at right. In classical theory (in contrast to jazz theory), this scale is commonly called the octatonic scale (or the octatonic collection), although there are a total of 42 non-enharmonically equivalent, non-transpositionally equivalent eight-note sets. The earliest systematic treatment of the octatonic scale was in Edmond de Polignac's unpublished treatise \\"Etude sur les successions alternantes de tons et demi-tons (Et sur la gamme dite majeure-mineure)\\" (Study of the Succession of Alternating Whole Tones and Semitones (and of the so-called Major-Minor Scale)) from c. 1879 , which preceded Vito Frazzi's Scale alternate per pianoforte of 1930 by a full half-century .  Nomenclature  In St. Petersburg at the turn of the 20th century, this scale had become so familiar in the circle of composers around Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov that it was referred to as the Korsakovian scale (–ö–æ—Ä—Å–∞–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–∞–º–º–∞) . As early as 1911, the Russian theorist Boleslav Yavorsky described this collection of pitches as the diminished mode (—É–º–µ–Ω—å—à—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ª–∞–¥), because of the stable way the diminished fifth functions in it . In more recent Russian theory, the term octatonic is not used. Instead, this scale is placed among other symmetrical modes (total 11) under its historical name Rimsky-Korsakov scale, or Rimsky-Korsakov mode (; ). In jazz theory, it is called the diminished scale or symmetric diminished scale because it can be conceived as a combination of two interlocking diminished seventh chords, just as the augmented scale can be conceived as a combination of two interlocking augmented triads. The two modes are sometimes referred to as the half-step/whole step diminished scale and the whole step/half-step diminished scale. Because it was associated in the early 20th century with the Dutch composer Willem Pijper, in the Netherlands, it is called the Pijper scale . Construction The twelve tones of the chromatic scale are covered by three disjoint diminished seventh chords. The notes from two such seventh- chords combination form an octatonic collection. Because there are three ways to select two from three, there are three octatonic scales in the twelve-tone system. Each octatonic scale has exactly two modes: the first begins its ascent with a whole step, while the second begins its ascent with a half step (semitone). These modes are sometimes referred to as the whole step/half-step diminished scale and the half-step/whole step diminished scale, respectively. Each of the three distinct scales can form differently named scales with the same sequence of tones by starting at a different point in the scale. With alternative starting points listed in parentheses, the three are: *E diminished (F/G, A, C diminished): E, F, F, G, A, B, C, D, E *D diminished (F, A, B diminished): D, E, F, G, G, A, B, C, D *D diminished (E, G, B diminished): C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, C It may also be represented as 013467910 or labeled as set class 8-28 .  Properties  = Symmetry = The three octatonic collections are transpositionally and inversionally symmetric‚Äîthat is, they are related by a variety of transposition and inversion operations: They are each closed under transpositions by 3, 6, or 9 semitones. A transposition by 1, 4, 7, or 10 semitones will transform the E scale into the D scale, the D scale into the D scale, and the D scale into the E scale. Conversely, transpositions by 2, 5, 8, or 11 semitones acts in the reverse way; the E scale goes to the D scale, D to D and D to E. Thus, the set of transpositions acts on the set of diminished collections as the integers modulo 3. If the transposition is congruent to 0 mod 3 the pitch collection is unchanged and the transpositions by 1 semitone or by 2 semitones are inverse to one another. The E and D collections can be swapped by inversions around E, F, A or C (the tones common to both scales). Similarly, the D and D collections can be swapped by inversions around E, G, B, D/C and the D and E collections by inversions around D, F, A, or B. All other transformations do not change the classes (e.g. reflecting the E collection around E gives the E collection once again). This unfortunately means that the inversions do not act as a simple cyclic group on the set of diminished scales. =Subsets= Among the collection's remarkable features is that it is the only collection that can be disassembled into four transpositionally related pitch pairs in six different ways, each of which features a different interval class . For example: *semitone: (C, C), (D, E) (F, G), (A, B) *whole step: (C, D), (E, F), (G, A), (B, C) *minor third: (C, E), (F, A), (C, E), (G, B) *major third: (C, E), (F, B), (E, G), (A, C) *perfect fourth: (C, F), (B, E), (G, C), (E, A) *tritone: (C, F), (E, A), (C, G), (E, B) Another remarkable feature of the diminished scale is that it contains the first four notes of four different minor scales separated by minor thirds. For example: C, D, E, F and (enharmonically) F, G, A, B. Also E, F, G, A, and A, B, C, D. The scale \\"allows familiar harmonic and linear configurations such as triads and modal tetrachords to be juxtaposed unusually but within a rational framework\\" though the relation of the diatonic scale to the melodic and harmonic surface is thus generally oblique . History = Early examples = Joseph Schillinger suggests that the scale was formulated already by Persian traditional music in the 7th century AD, where it was called \\"Zar ef Kend\\", meaning \\"string of pearls\\", the idea being that the two different sizes of intervals were like two different sizes of pearls Octatonic scales first occurred in Western music as byproducts of a series of minor-third transpositions. While Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov claimed he was conscious of the octatonic collection \\"as a cohesive frame of reference\\" in his autobiography My Musical Life , instances can be found in music of previous centuries. Eytan locates one in Domenico Scarlatti's Sonata K. 319. In the following passage, according to \\"its descending whole-step/half-step bass progression is complete and continuous\\".Scarlatti Sonata K319, bars 62-80 Scarlatti's Sonata K. 319, bars 62‚Äì80. also cites the following bars from J.S. Bach's English Suite No. 3 as octatonic:Octatonic bars from Sarabande from English Suite No 3 Sarabande from J.S. Bach's English Suite No. 3, bars 17‚Äì19. Honor√© Langl√©'s 1797 harmony treatise contains a sequential progression with a descending octatonic bass, supporting harmonies that use all and only the notes of an octatonic scale . = 19th century = In 1800, Beethoven composed his Piano Sonata No. 11 in B, Op. 22. The slow movement of this work contains a passage of what was, for its time, highly dissonant harmony. In a lecture (2005), pianist Andr√°s Schiff describes the harmony of this passage as \\"really extraordinary\\". The chord progressions at the beginning of the second and third bars of this passage are octatonic:Adagio (2nd movement) from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 11, bars 31‚Äì33. Adagio (2nd movement) from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 11, bars 31‚Äì33. Later in the 19th century, the notes in the chords of the coronation bells from the opening scene of Modest Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov, which consist of \\"two dominant seventh chords with roots a tritone apart\\" according to , are entirely derived from an octatonic scale. Coronation scene from Boris GodunovCoronation scene from Boris Godunov. Taruskin continues: \\"Thanks to the reinforcement the lesson has received in some equally famous pieces like Scheherazade, the progression is often thought of as being peculiarly Russian\\" . Tchaikovsky was also influenced by the harmonic and coloristic potential of octatonicism. As Mark points out, the cascading arpeggios played on the celesta in the \\"Sugar Plum Fairy\\" from The Nutcracker ballet are made up of dominant seventh chords a minor third apart. Cascading arpeggios on celesta from Sugar Plum FairyCascading arpeggios on celesta from the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. \\"Hagens Watch\\", one of the darkest and most sinister scenes in Richard Wagner's opera G√∂tterd√§mmerung features chromatic harmonies using eleven of the twelve chromatic notes, within which the eight notes of the octatonic scale may be found in bars 9‚Äì10 below:Wagner, \\"Hagen's Watch\\" from G√∂tterd√§mmerung, Act 1. Listen = Late 19th and 20th century = Istrian scale in Schubert's Symphony No. 8 in B minor (1922), 1st mvt., bars 13-20 (); flat fifth marked with asterisk . The scale also may be found in the music of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Melodic phrases that move by alternating tones and semitones frequently appear in the works of both these composers. Allen identifies a five-note segment in the cor anglais melody heard near the start of Debussy's \\"Nuages\\" from his orchestral suite Nocturnes as octatonic. Mark describes \\"Nuages\\" as \\"arguably [Debussy's] boldest single leap into the musical unknown. 'Nuages' defines a kind of tonality never heard before, based on the centricity of a diminished tonic triad (B-D-F natural).\\" According to Stephen Walsh, the cor anglais theme \\"hangs in the texture like some motionless object, always the same and always at the same pitch\\" . There is a particularly striking and effective use of the octatonic scale in the opening bars of Liszt's late piece Bagatelle sans tonalit√© from 1885. The scale was extensively used by Rimsky-Korsakov's student Igor Stravinsky, particularly in his Russian-period works such as Petrushka (1911), The Rite of Spring (1913), up to the Symphonies of Wind Instruments (1920). Passages using this scale are unmistakable as early as the Scherzo fantastique, Fireworks (both from 1908), and The Firebird (1910). It also appears in later works by Stravinsky, such as the Symphony of Psalms (1930), the Symphony in Three Movements (1945), most of the neoclassical works from the Octet (1923) to Agon (1957), and even in some of the later serial compositions such as the Canticum Sacrum (1955) and Threni (1958). In fact, \\"few if any composers have been known to employ relations available to the collection as extensively or in as varied a manner as Stravinsky\\" . The second movement of Stravinsky's Octet for wind instruments opens with what Stephen calls \\"a broad melody completely in the octatonic scale\\". Jonathan describes a highly rhythmic passage in the first movement of the Symphony in Three Movements as \\"gloriously octatonic, not an unfamiliar situation in jazz, where this mode is known as the 'diminished scale', but Stravinsky of course knew it from Rimsky. The 'rumba' passage‚Ä¶ alternates chords of E-flat7 and C7, over and over, distantly recalling the coronation scene from Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. In celebrating America, the √©migr√© looked back once again to Russia.\\" catalogues many other octatonic moments in Stravinsky's music. The scale also may be found in music of Alexander Scriabin and B√©la Bart√≥k. In Bart√≥k's Bagatelles, Fourth Quartet, Cantata Profana, and Improvisations, the octatonic is used with the diatonic, whole tone, and other \\"abstract pitch formations\\" all \\"entwined‚Ä¶ in a very complex mixture\\" . Mikrokosmos Nos. 99, 101, and 109 are octatonic pieces, as is No. 33 of the 44 Duos for Two Violins. \\"In each piece, changes of motive and phrase correspond to changes from one of the three octatonic scales to another, and one can easily select a single central and referential form of 8-28 in the context of each complete piece.\\" However, even his larger pieces also feature \\"sections that are intelligible as 'octatonic music'\\" . Olivier Messiaen made frequent use of the octatonic scale throughout his career as a composer, and indeed in his seven modes of limited transposition, the octatonic scale is Mode 2. Peter writes in detail about \\"La Colombe\\" (The Dove), the first of a set of Preludes for piano that Messiaen completed in 1929, at the age of 20. Hill speaks of a characteristic \\"merging of tonality (E major) with the octatonic mode\\" in this short piece. Other twentieth-century composers who used octatonic collections include Samuel Barber, Ernest Bloch, Benjamin Britten, Julian Cochran, George Crumb, Irving Fine, Ross Lee Finney, Alberto Ginastera, John Harbison, Jacques H√©tu, Aram Khachaturian, Witold Lutos≈Çawski, Darius Milhaud, Henri Dutilleux, Robert Morris, Carl Orff, Jean Papineau-Couture, Krzysztof Penderecki, Francis Poulenc, Sergei Prokofiev, Alexander Scriabin, Dmitri Shostakovich, Toru Takemitsu, Joan Tower , Robert Xavier Rodriguez, and Frank Zappa . Other composers include Willem Pijper , who may have inferred the collection from Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he greatly admired, and composed at least one piece‚Äîhis Piano Sonatina No. 2‚Äîentirely in the octatonic system . In the 1920s, Heinrich Schenker criticized the use of the octatonic scale, specifically Stravinsky's Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, for the oblique relation between the diatonic scale and the harmonic and melodic surface . Harmonic implications =Jazz= Both the half-whole diminished and its partner mode, the whole-half diminished (with a tone rather than a semitone beginning the pattern) are commonly used in jazz improvisation, frequently under different names. The whole-half diminished scale is commonly used in conjunction with diminished harmony (e.g., the Edim7 chord) while the half-whole scale is used in dominant harmony (e.g., with an F9 chord). Examples of octatonic jazz include Jaco Pastorius' composition \\"Opus Pocus\\" from the album Pastorius and Herbie Hancock's piano solo on \\"Freedom Jazz Dance\\" from the album Miles Smiles (1967). = Petrushka chord= The Petrushka chord is a recurring polytonal device used in Igor Stravinsky's ballet Petrushka and in later music. In the Petrushka chord, two major triads, C major and F major ‚Äì a tritone apart ‚Äì clash, \\"horribly with each other\\", when sounded together and create a dissonant chord . The six-note chord is contained within an octatonic scale. =Bitonality= In B√©la Bart√≥k's piano piece, \\"Diminished Fifth\\" from Mikrokosmos, octatonic collections form the basis of the pitch content. In mm. 1‚Äì11, all eight pitch classes from the E diminished scale appear. In mm. 1‚Äì4, the pitch classes A, B, C, and D appear in the right hand, and the pitch classes E, F, G, and A are in the left hand. The collection in the right hand outlines the first four notes of an A minor scale, and the collection in the left hand outlines the first four notes of an E minor scale. In mm. 5‚Äì11, the left and right hand switch‚Äîthe A minor tetrachord appears in the left hand, and the E minor tetrachord appears in the right hand. From this, one can see that Bart√≥k has partitioned the octatonic collection into two (symmetrical) four-note segments of the natural minor scales a tritone apart. Paul Wilson argues against viewing this as bitonality since \\"the larger octatonic collection embraces and supports both supposed tonalities\\" . Bart√≥k also utilizes the two other octatonic collections so that all three possible octatonic collections are found throughout this piece (D, D, and E). In mm. 12‚Äì18, all eight pitch classes from the D octatonic collection are present. The E octatonic collection from mm. 1‚Äì11 is related to this D octatonic collection by the transposition operations, T, T4, T7, T10. In mm. 26‚Äì29, all eight pitch classes from the D octatonic collection appear. This collection is related to the E octatonic collection from mm. 1‚Äì11 by the following transposition operations: T2, T5, T8, T11. Other relevant features of the piece include the groups of three notes taken from the whole-half diminished scale in mm. 12‚Äì18. In these measures, the right hand features D, E, and G, the tetrachord without the 3rd (F). The left hand has the same tetrachord transposed down a tritone (G, A, C). In mm. 16, both hands transpose down three semitones to B, C, E and E, G, A respectively. Later on, in mm. 20, the right hand moves on to A‚àí and the left back to E‚àí. After repeating the structure of mm. 12‚Äì19 in mm. 29‚Äì34 the piece ends with the treble part returning to A‚àí and the bass part returning to E. =Alpha chord= The alpha chord (Œ± chord) collection is, \\"a vertically organized statement of the octatonic scale as two diminished seventh chords,\\" such as: C‚ÄìE‚ÄìG‚ÄìB‚ÄìC‚ÄìE‚ÄìF‚ÄìA . One of the most important subsets of the alpha collection, the alpha chord (Forte number: 4-17, pitch class prime form (0347)), such as E‚ÄìG‚ÄìC‚ÄìE ; using the theorist Ern≈ë Lendvai's terminology, the C alpha chord) may be considered a mistuned major chord or major/minor in first inversion (in this case, C major/minor) . The number of semitones in the interval array of the alpha chord corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence . =Beta chord= The beta chord (Œ≤ chord) is a five-note chord, formed from the first five notes of the alpha chord (integers: 0,3,6,9,11 ; notes: C, E, G, B, C). The beta chord can also occur in its reduced form, that is, limited to the characteristic tones (C, E, G, C and C, G, C). Forte number: 5-31B. The beta chord may be created from a diminished seventh chord by adding a diminished octave. It may be created from a major chord by adding the sharpened root (solfege: in C, di is C: C, E, G, C) . =Gamma chord= The gamma chord (Œ≥ chord) is 0,3,6,8,11 (Forte number 5-32A ) . It is the beta chord with one interval diminished: C, E, G, A, C. It may be considered a major-minor minor seventh chord on A: A, C, C, E, G. See also: Elektra chord.

This means that it comprises the three irreducibly essential tones that define a dominant seventh chord, which are root, major third, and minor seventh and that all other chord tones have been altered. These are: * the fifth is altered to a 5 and a 5 * the ninth is altered to a 9 and a 9 *the eleventh is altered to a 11 (equivalent to a 5) *the thirteenth is altered to a 13 (equivalent to a 5) The altered forms of some of the non-essential tones coincide (augmented eleventh with diminished fifth and augmented fifth with minor thirteenth) meaning those scale degrees are enharmonically identical and have multiple potential spellings. The natural forms of the non-essential tones are not present in the scale. This means it lacks a major ninth, a perfect eleventh, a perfect fifth, and a major thirteenth.

For example, \\"C7alt\\" supplants \\"C759911\\", \\"C7‚àí5+5‚àí9+9\\", \\"Caug7‚àí9+9+11\\", etc. This scale has existed for a long time as the 7th mode of melodic minor. Enharmonic spellings and alternate names The C altered scale is also enharmonically equivalent to the C Locrian mode with F changed to F. For this reason, the altered scale is sometimes called the super-Locrian scale or the Locrian flat four scale . It is also enharmonically the seventh mode of the ascending melodic minor scale. The altered scale is also known as the Pomeroy scale after Herb Pomeroy (; ), the Ravel scale after Maurice Ravel, and the diminished whole tone scale due to its resemblance to the lower part of the diminished scale and the upper part of the whole tone scale . The super-Locrian scale (enharmonically identical to the altered scale) is obtained by flattening the fourth note of the diatonic Locrian mode: : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 c4^\\\\markup { C super-Locrian scale } des es fes ges aes bes c2 } } Another way to obtain the altered scale is by thinking of it as the 7th mode of the melodic minor scale.

It was a common practice in those times to take the genitive of the father's name for latinization, but this genitive was used as nominative in Latin texts (\\"Venerabilis & religiosus frater Henricus institoris\\").

Das Kirchenrecht der Katholiken und Protestanten in Deutschland. Band VI. 1897. Reprint Guttentag, 1959. was a German churchman and inquisitor. With his widely distributed book Malleus Maleficarum (1487), which describes witchcraft and endorses detailed processes for the extermination of witches, he was instrumental in establishing the period of witch trials in the early modern period.  Life  Born in Schlettstadt, now S√©lestat, Alsace, he joined the Dominican Order at an early age and while still a young man was appointed Prior of the Dominican house of his native town.Rothman, David J., Marcus, Steven and Kiceluk, Stephanie A., Medicine and Western Civilization, Rutgers University Press, 1995 At some date before 1474 he was appointed Inquisitor for the Tyrol, Salzburg, Bohemia and Moravia. His eloquence in the pulpit and tireless activity received recognition at Rome and he was the right-hand man of the Archbishop of Salzburg. The papal bull Summis desiderantes which Pope Innocent VIII published in 1484 acknowledges the existence of witches and explicitly empowers the inquisition to prosecute witches and sorcerers. The bull aimed to reaffirm the jurisdiction of Kramer, who was denied authority as an Inquisitor in Germany. One year later, he went to Innsbruck as the head of an inquisitorial commission with the stated intention of \\"bringing witches to justice\\" Broedel, Hans P. \\"The Malleus Maleficarum and the construction of witchcraft: theology and popular belief\\", page 1 (2003). Despite being granted episcopal jurisdiction to conduct trials by Georg Golser, bishop of Brixen, the latter would eventually acquire a distaste for the alleged Kramer's scandals. This most likely referred to the whole interrogation of Helena Scheuberin in Innsbruck and 13 other citizens accused of witchcraft. Helena herself, married to a prosperous burgher named Sebastian, was described as an \\"aggressive, independent woman who was not afraid to speak her mind\\" Broedel, Hans P. \\"The Malleus Maleficarum and the construction of witchcraft: theology and popular belief\\", page 1 (2003). Right after Kramer had arrived in the city, she had passed him in the street, spatted and cursed him publicly: \\"Fie on you, you bad monk, may the falling evil take you\\". Later, it was discovered she was not attending Kramer's sermons and encouraged others to do likewise, things of which were all brought against her as charges for the crime of witchcraft. Helena even disrupted one of his sermons \\"by loudly proclaiming that she believed Institoris to be an evil man in league with the devil\\".Broedel, Hans P, p. 1 (2003) During her trial, as Kramer focused heavily on the sexuality of Scheuberin, he was accused by the bishop of having \\"presumed much that had not been proved\\". Kramer remained in Innsbruck to continue the investigation, collect evidence, and interrogate suspected witches. Golser and Kramer exchanged letters encouraging Kramer to quit the investigation, ending with a final letter in 1486 in which Golser ordered Kramer to leave his diocese, the trials in Innsbruck finally being suspended. Kramer finally relented and returned to Cologne. In response to the Bishop's criticism, Kramer began to write a treatise on witchcraft that later became the Malleus Maleficarum (literally \\"The Hammer of Witches\\"). The bull Summis desiderantes which gave him the authority of prosecuting and investigating cases of sorcery was included in the forefront of the book, first published in 1487. Kramer failed in his attempt to obtain endorsement for this work from the top theologians of the Inquisition at the Faculty of Cologne, and they condemned the book as recommending unethical and illegal procedures, as well as being inconsistent to what they perceived as the orthodox Catholic doctrines of demonology.Jolly, Raudvere, & Peters(eds.), \\"Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages\\", page 241 (2002). However, his book was not only consistent with earlier 15th century witchcraft manuals of John Nider and Jean Tinctor, his references, but also quoting the authority of other Dominicans such as the Catalan inquisitor Nicholas Eymerich and saint-doctor Thomas Aquinas. In the overall evaluation, his works were praised and his prestige was growing. He was asked by Nuremberg council to provide expert consultation on the procedure of witch trial in 1491.. In 1495 he was summoned by the Master General of the Order, Joaquin de Torres, O.P. to Venice and gave very popular public lectures and disputations. They were worthy of presence and patronage of Patriarch of Venice.

Pockets in the meat are made by small cuts, into which oysters are stuffed and sutured with toothpicks or thread. As the dish is grilled, the flavour of the fresh oysters permeates the steak and blends with the juice of the tender meat. The combination of beef and oysters is traditional and formed part of the everyday diet of oyster fisherman in Swansea in the mid 1800s. The earliest specific reference in the United States was a newspaper in 1891, which may indicate a connection with carpetbaggers or to gluttony. The earliest specific Australian reference is a printed recipe from between 1899 and 1907.Carpet Bag a la Colchester, Jean Rutledge, Goulburn Cookery Book, various editions Another recipe from 1909 includes cayenne pepper as an ingredient, which may indicate an American origin.The Truth about Carpetbag Steak The Old Foodie The more recent Australian versions typically use Worcestershire sauce, as does the local version of Oysters Kilpatrick.

He was born in Rheinfelden, Further Austria, taught at the University of Cologne, and died in 1495 in Strasbourg.

All editions after 1519 named Sprenger as Heinrich Kramer's co-author. states that Sprenger worked on the compilation with Kramer from around 1485 to 1487. It has been claimed that Sprenger cannot be linked to any witch trial, that his personal relationship to Kramer was acrimonious, and that Sprenger used his powerful position whenever he could to make Kramer's life and work as difficult as possible.K.

Some scholars now believe that he became associated with the Malleus Maleficarum largely as a result of Kramer's wish to lend his book as much official authority as possible.See for example Hans Peter Broedel, The \\"Malleus Maleficarum\\" and the Construction of Witchcraft: Theology and Popular Belief (2003) p. 19. =Friedrich Spee in Cologne= In a 1631 work most concerned with innocence, and opposed to the Malleus Maleficarum, Friedrich Spee attributes authorship of the notorious book to \\"Jacob Sprenger and Heinrich Kramer.\\" Cautio Criminalis (2nd Edition,1632)p. 171. Note, per Marcus Hellyer, p. xiv, this 2nd edition was probably printed samizdat in Cologne though the title page claims Frankfurt. Though Spee was Jesuit (not Dominican) and his work was written more than a century after Malleus Maleficarum, both Spee and Sprenger were professors of theology in Cologne and both travelled extensively in many of the same areas. Some of Spee's fellow professors in Cologne were appalled by Spee's book and thought it should be listed on the papal Index of Forbidden Books. This would suggest that, whether or not Sprenger initially endorsed or opposed the work of Heinrich Kramer, the book carrying Sprenger's name did eventually find a degree of influence among the Catholic theologians in Cologne.Marcus Hellyer translation Cautio Criminalis (2003) p.xiv =Salem Witch Trials= The Harvard President and Puritan Increase Mather cited \\"Sprenger\\" as a reference to the Malleus Maleficarum in an influential witch-phobic work published in 1684,Increase Mather, Remarkable Providences (1684) p.140. as well as another work published in 1692, the same year as the Salem Witch Trials: \\"Witches have often (as Sprenger observes) desired that they might stand or fall by this trial by hot iron, and sometimes come off well.\\"Cotton and Increase Mather, Farther Account of the Trials of New-England Witches (1862 London reprint) p.272.

Pirate radio or a pirate radio station is a radio station that broadcasts without a valid license. In some cases radio stations are considered legal where the signal is transmitted, but illegal where the signals are received--especially when the signals cross a national boundary. In other cases, a broadcast may be considered \\"pirate\\" due to the nature of its content, its transmission format (especially a failure to transmit a station identification according to regulations), or the transmit power (wattage) of the station, even if the transmission is not technically illegal (such as an amateur radio transmission). Pirate radio is sometimes called bootleg radio (a term especially associated with two-way radio), clandestine radio (associated with heavily politically motivated operations) or free radio. History Radio \\"piracy\\" began with the advent of regulations of the airwaves at the dawn of the age of radio. Initially, radio, or wireless as it was more commonly called at the time, was an open field of hobbyists and early inventors and experimenters. The degree of state control varied by country, for example in the UK, Marconi's work was supported by the post office, but in an era of weak regulation, a music hall magician Nevil Maskelyne deliberately hijacked a demonstration. https://sm.asisonline.org/Pages/Hacked.aspx The United States Navy began using radio for time signals and weather reports on the eastern coast of the United States in the 1890s. Before the advent of valve (vacuum tube) technology, early radio enthusiasts used noisy spark-gap transmitters, such as the first spark-gap modulation technology pioneered by the first real audio (rather than telegraph code) radio broadcaster, Charles D. Herrold, in San Jose, California, or the Ruhmkorff coil used by almost all early experimenters. The navy soon began complaining to a sympathetic press that amateurs were disrupting naval transmissions. The May 25, 1907, edition of Electrical World in an article called \\"Wireless and Lawless\\" reported authorities were unable to prevent an amateur from interfering with the operation of a government station at the Washington, D.C. Navy Yard using legal means. In the run-up to the London Radiotelegraph Convention in 1912 (essentially an international gentlemen's agreement on use of the radio band, non-binding and, on the high seas, completely null), and amid concerns about the safety of marine radio following the sinking of the ' on April 15 of that year (although there were never allegations of radio interference in that event), the New York Herald of April 17, 1912, headlined President William Howard Taft's initiative to regulate the public airwaves in an article titled \\"President Moves to Stop Mob Rule of Wireless.\\" =USA= In the USA when the \\"Act to Regulate Radio Communication\\" was passed on August 13, 1912, amateurs and experimenters were not banned from broadcasting; rather, amateurs were assigned their own frequency spectrum, and licensing and call-signs were introduced. By regulating the public airwaves, President Taft thus created the legal space for open broadcasts to take place. An entire federal agency, the Federal Radio Commission, was formed in 1927 and succeeded in 1934 by the Federal Communications Commission. These agencies would enforce rules on call- signs, assigned frequencies, licensing and acceptable content for broadcast. The Radio Act of 1912 gave the president legal permission to shut down radio stations \\"in time of war\\", and during the first two and a half years of World War I, before US entry, President Wilson tasked the US Navy with monitoring US radio stations, nominally to \\"ensure neutrality.\\" The navy used this authority to shut down amateur radio in the western part of the US (the US was divided into two civilian radio \\"districts\\" with corresponding call-signs, beginning with \\"K\\" in the west and \\"W\\" in the east, in the regulatory measures; the navy was assigned call-signs beginning with \\"N\\"). When Wilson declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, he also issued an executive order closing most radio stations not needed by the US government. The navy took it a step further and declared it was illegal to listen to radio or possess a receiver or transmitter in the US, but there were doubts they had the authority to issue such an order even in war time. The ban on radio was lifted in the US in late 1919. In 1924, New York City station WHN was accused by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;) of being an \\"outlaw station\\" for violating trade licenses which permitted only AT&T; stations to sell airtime on their transmitters. As a result of the AT&T; interpretation a landmark case was heard in court, which even prompted comments from Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover when he took a public stand in the station's defense. Although AT&T; won its case, the furor created was such that those restrictive provisions of the transmitter license were never enforced. In 1926 WJAZ in Chicago, Illinois challenged the U.S. government's authority to specify operating frequencies and was charged with being a \\"wave pirate\\". The station responded with this February 1926 publicity photograph of its engineering staff dressed as \\"wave pirates\\".WJAZ \\"wave pirates\\" publicity photograph, Popular Radio, May 1926, page 90. In 1926, WJAZ in Chicago changed its frequency to one previously reserved for Canadian stations without getting permission to make the change, and was charged by the federal government with \\"wave piracy\\". The resulting legal battle found that the Radio Act of 1912 did not allow the U.S. government to require stations to operate on specific frequencies, and the result was the passage of the Radio Act of 1927 to strengthen the government's regulatory authority. While Mexico issued radio station XERF with a license to broadcast, the power of its 250 kW transmitter was far greater than the maximum of 50 kW authorized for commercial use by the government of the United States of America. Consequently, XERF and many other radio stations in Mexico, which sold their broadcasting time to sponsors of English-language commercial and religious programs, were labelled as \\"border blasters\\", but not \\"pirate radio stations\\", even though the content of many of their programs could not have been aired by a US-regulated broadcaster. Predecessors to XERF, for instance, had originally broadcast in Kansas, advocating \\"goat-gland surgery\\" for improved masculinity, but moved to Mexico to evade US laws about advertising medical treatments, particularly unproven ones. = Europe= In Europe, Denmark had the first known radio station in the world to broadcast commercial radio from a vessel in international waters without permission from the authorities in the country that it broadcast to (Denmark in this case). The station was named Radio Mercur and began transmission on August 2, 1958. In the Danish newspapers it was soon called a \\"pirate radio\\". = United Kingdom = In the 1960s in the UK, the term referred to not only a perceived unauthorized use of the state-run spectrum by the unlicensed broadcasters but also the risk-taking nature of offshore radio stations that actually operated on anchored ships or marine platforms. The term had been used previously in Britain and the US to describe unlicensed land-based broadcasters and even border blasters (for example, a 1940 British comedy about an unauthorized TV broadcaster, Band Waggon, uses the phrase \\"pirate station\\" several times). A good example of this kind of activity was Radio Luxembourg located in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The English language evening broadcasts from Radio Luxembourg were beamed by Luxembourg- licensed transmitters. The audience in the United Kingdom originally listened to their radio sets by permission of a wireless license issued by the British General Post Office (GPO). However, under terms of that wireless licence, it was an offence under the Wireless Telegraphy Act to listen to unauthorised broadcasts, which possibly included those transmitted by Radio Luxembourg. Therefore, as far as the British authorities were concerned, Radio Luxembourg was a \\"pirate radio station\\" and British listeners to the station were breaking the law (although as the term 'unauthorised' was never properly defined it was somewhat of a legal grey area). This did not stop British newspapers from printing programme schedules for the station, or a British weekly magazine aimed at teenage girls, Fab 208, from promoting the DJs and their lifestyle (Radio Luxembourg's wavelength was 208 metres (1439, then 1440 kHz)). Radio Luxembourg was later joined by other well-known pirate stations received in the UK in violation of UK licensing, including Radio Caroline and Radio Atlanta (subsequently Radio Carolines North and South respectively, following their merger and the original ship's relocation) and Radio London, all of which broadcast from vessels anchored outside of territorial limits and were therefore legitimate. Radio Jackie, for instance (although transmitting illegally), was registered for VAT and even had its address and telephone number in local telephone directories. By the 1970s, pirate radio in the UK had mostly moved to land-based broadcasting, transmitting from tower blocks in towns and cities. =Free radio= Another variation on the term pirate radio came about during the \\"Summer of Love\\" in San Francisco during the 1960s. These were \\"Free radio\\", which usually referred to secret and unlicensed land- based transmissions. These were also tagged as being pirate radio transmissions. Free Radio was used only to refer to radio transmissions that were beyond government control, as was offshore radio in the UK and Europe. The term free radio was adopted by the Free Radio Association of listeners who defended the rights of the offshore radio stations broadcasting from ships and marine structures off the coastline of the United Kingdom. F√©lix Guattari points out: In Europe, in addition to adopting the term free radio, supportive listeners of what had been called pirate radio adopted the term 'offshore radio, which was usually the term used by the owners of the marine broadcasting stations. More recently the term \\"free radio\\" implied that the broadcasts were commercial-free and the station was there only for the output, be it a type of music or spoken opinion. In this context, 'pirate' radio thus refers to stations that do advertise and plug various gigs and raves. Pirate radio by geographical area Since this subject covers national territories, international waters and international airspace, the only effective way to treat this subject is on a country by country, international waters and international airspace basis. Because the laws vary, the interpretation of the term pirate radio also varies considerably. Propaganda broadcasting Propaganda broadcasting may be authorized by the government at the transmitting site, but may be considered unwanted or illegal by the government of the intended reception area. Propaganda broadcasting conducted by national governments against the interests of other national governments has created radio jamming stations transmitting noises on the same frequency to prevent reception of the incoming signal. While the United States transmitted its programs towards the Soviet Union, which attempted to jam them, in 1970 the government of the United Kingdom decided to employ a jamming transmitter to drown out the incoming transmissions from the commercial station Radio North Sea International, which was based aboard the motor vessel (MV) Mebo II anchored off southeast England in the North Sea. Other examples of this type of unusual broadcasting include the USCGC Courier (WAGR-410), a United States Coast Guard cutter which both originated and relayed broadcasts of the Voice of America from an anchorage at the Greek island of Rhodes to Soviet bloc countries. Balloons have been flown above Key West, Florida, to support the TV transmissions of TV Mart√≠, which are directed at Cuba (the Cuban government jams the signals). Military broadcasting aircraft have been flown over Vietnam, Iraq, and many other nations by the United States Air Force. Piracy in amateur and two-way radio Illegal use of licensed radio spectrum (also known as bootlegging in CB circles) is fairly common and takes several forms. *Unlicensed operation‚ÄîParticularly associated with amateur radio and licensed personal communication services such as GMRS, this refers to use of radio equipment on a section of spectrum for which the equipment is designed but on which the user is not licensed to operate (most such operators are informally known as \\"bubble pack pirates\\" from the sealed plastic retail packaging common to such walkie-talkies). While piracy on the US GMRS band, for example, is widespread (some estimates have the number of total GMRS users outstripping the number of licensed users by several orders of magnitude), such use is generally disciplined only in cases where the pirate's activity interferes with a licensee. A notable case is that of former United States amateur operator Jack Gerritsen operating under the revoked call sign KG6IRO who was successfully prosecuted by the FCC for unlicensed operation and malicious interference. A subcategory of this is free banding, the use of allocations nearby a legal allocation, most typically the 27 MHz Citizen's Band using modified or purpose-built gear. *Inadvertent interference‚ÄîCommon when personal communications gear is brought into countries where it is not certified to operate. Such interference results from clashing frequency allocations, and occasionally requires wholesale reallocation of an existing band due to an insurmountable interference problem; for example, the 2004 approval in Canada of the unlicensed use of the United States General Mobile Radio Service frequencies due to interference from users of FRS/GMRS radios from the United States, where Industry Canada had to transfer a number of licensed users on the GMRS frequencies to unoccupied channels to accommodate the expanded service. *Deliberate or malicious interference‚Äîrefers to the use of two-way radio to harass or jam other users of a channel. Such behaviour is widely prosecuted, especially when it interferes with mission-critical services such as aviation radio or marine VHF radio. *Illegal equipment‚ÄîThis refers to the use of illegally modified equipment or equipment not certified for a particular band. Such equipment includes illegal linear amplifiers for CB radio, antenna or circuit modifications on walkie-talkies, the use of \\"export\\" radios for free banding, or the use of amateur radios on unlicensed bands that amateur gear is not certified for. The use of marine VHF radio gear for inland mobile radio operations is common in some countries, with enforcement difficult since marine VHF is generally the province of maritime authorities.

The text reads: Ad mundum mitto mea iacula dumque sagitto At ubi iustus erit nulla sagitta ferit Sed male viventes hos vulnero transgredientes Conscius ergo sibi se speculetur ibi John Gower (; c. 1330 ‚Äì October 1408) was an English poet, a contemporary of William Langland and the Pearl Poet, and a personal friend of Geoffrey Chaucer. He is remembered primarily for three major works, the Mirour de l'Omme, Vox Clamantis, and Confessio Amantis, three long poems written in French, Latin, and English respectively, which are united by common moral and political themes. Life Few details are known of Gower's early life. He was probably born into a family which held properties in Kent and Suffolk. Stanley and Smith use a linguistic argument to conclude that \\"Gower‚Äôs formative years were spent partly in Kent and partly in Suffolk\\". Southern and Nicolas conclude that the Gower family of Kent and Suffolk cannot be related to the Yorkshire Gowers because their coats of arms are drastically different. Macaulay and other critics have observed that he must have spent considerable time reading the Bible, Ovid, Secretum Secretorum, Petrus Riga, Speculum Speculationum, Valerius Maximus, John of Salisbury, and others.* He once met Richard II. In the prologue of the first recension of the Confessio Amantis, he tells how the king, chancing to meet him on the Thames (probably circa 1385), invited him aboard the royal barge, and that their conversation then resulted in a commission for the work that would become the Confessio Amantis. left note line 22 Later in life his allegiance switched to the future Henry IV, to whom later editions of the Confessio Amantis were dedicated. Much of this is based on circumstantial rather than documentary evidence, and the history of revisions of the Confessio Amantis, including the different dedications, is yet to be fully understood. The source of Gower‚Äôs income remains a mystery. He may have practised law in or around London. George Campbell Macaulay lists several real estate transactions to which Gower was a party. Macaulay's Introduction to the French Works suggests that Gower may have been a dealer in wool. This is based on remarks from Mirour d l'Omme line 25360ff. From 1365 he received ten pounds' rent for the manor of Wygebergh in Essex. From 1382 until death he received forty pounds per annum from selling Feltwell in Norfolk and Moulton in Suffolk. In 1399 Henry IV granted him a pension, in the form of an annual allowance of two pipes (= 1 tun = 240 gallons) of Gascony wine. Carlson estimates the value of the two pipes as 3 to 4 pounds wholesale or 8 pounds retail. The tomb of John Gower in Southwark Cathedral Gower's friendship with Chaucer is also well documented. When Chaucer was sent as a diplomat to Italy in 1378, Gower was one of the men to whom he gave power of attorney over his affairs in England. The two poets also paid one another compliments in their verse: Chaucer dedicated his Troilus and Criseyde in part to \\"moral Gower\\", and Gower reciprocated by placing a speech in praise of Chaucer in the mouth of Venus at the end of the Confessio Amantis (first recension VIII.2950-70). The Introduction to the Man of Law's Tale (lines 77‚Äì89) contains an apparent reference to Gower‚Äôs tales of Canacee and Tyro Appolonius. Tyrwhitt (1822) believed that this offended Gower and led to the removal of Venus‚Äô praise of Chaucer. Twentieth century sources have more innocent reasons for the deletion. At some point during the middle 1370s, he took up residence in rooms provided by the Priory of St Mary Overie (now Southwark Cathedral). In 1398, while living here, he married,Register of William of Wykman ii. f.299b. not verified probably for the second time: his wife, Agnes Groundolf, who survived him. In his last years, and possibly as early as 1400, he became blind. After his death in 1408, Gower was interred in an ostentatious tomb in the Priory church (now Southwark Cathedral), which remains today. Macaulay provides much information and speculation about Gower. Some of his conclusions are inferences drawn from the trilingual writings of Gower. Where possible he draws upon legal records and other biographers. Works Gower's verse is by turns religious, political, historical, and moral‚Äîthough he has been narrowly defined as \\"moral Gower\\" ever since Chaucer graced him with the epithet. His primary mode is allegory, although he shies away from sustained abstractions in favour of the plain style of the raconteur. His earliest works were probably ballades in Anglo-Norman French, some of which may have later been included in his work the Cinkante Ballades. The first work which has survived is in the same language, however: it is the Speculum Meditantis, also known by the French title Mirour de l'Omme, a poem of just under 30,000 lines, containing a dense exposition of religion and morality. According to Yeager \\"Gower's first intent to write a poem for the instructional betterment of king and court, at a moment when he had reason to believe advice about social reform might influence changes predictably to take place in an expanded jurisdiction, when the French and English peoples were consolidated under a single crown.\\" Gower's second major work, the Vox Clamantis, was written in Latin. The first book has an allegorical account of the Peasants' Revolt which begins as an allegory, becomes quite specific and ends with an allusion to William Walworth‚Äôs suppression of the rebels. Gower takes the side of the aristocracy but the actions of Richard II are described by \\"the captain in vain endeavoured to direct the ship‚Äôs course\\".Subsequent books decry the sins of various classes of the social order: priests, friars, knights, peasants, merchants, lawyers. The last two books give advice to King Richard II and express the poet‚Äôs love for England. As Gower admits,Vox Clamatis Prologos Libri Secunti much of Vox Clamantis was borrowed from other authors. Macaulay refers to this as \\"schoolboy plagiarism\\" Peter classifies Mirour and Vox as \\"complaint literature\\" in the vein of Langland. His third work is the Confessio Amantis, a 30,000-line poem in octosyllabic English couplets, which makes use of the structure of a Christian confession (presented allegorically as a confession of sins against Love) as a narrative frame within which a multitude of individual tales are told. Like his previous works, the theme is very much morality, even where the stories themselves have a tendency to describe rather immoral behaviour. One scholar asserts that Confessio Amantis \\"almost exclusively\\" made Gower's \\"poetic reputation.\\"Grey, Douglas. \\"John Gower.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford UP, 2004. Fisher views the three major works as \\"one continuous work\\" with In Praise of Peace as a capstone. There is \\"movement from the courtly tone of the Cinkante Balades to the moral and philosophical tone of the Traitie.\\" Leland (ca 1540) states \\"that the three works were intended to present a systematic discourse upon the nature of man and society.\\" > They provide as organized and unified a view as we have of the social ideals > on England upon the eve of the Renaissance. This view may be subsumed under > the three broad headings: individual VIRTUE, legal JUSTICE, and the > administrative responsibility of the KING. The works progress from the > description of the origins of sin and the nature of the vices and virtues at > the beginning of the Mirour de l'omme, through consideration of social law > and order in the discussion of the three estates in the Mirour and Vox > Clamatis, to a final synthesis of royal responsibiity of Empedoclean love in > the Confessio Amantis. In later years Gower published a number of minor works in all three languages: * the Cinkante Ballades, a series of French ballades on romantic subjects. Yeager (2011) argues that these sonnets were composed throughout Gower‚Äôs lifetime. * the English poem In Praise of Peace \\"is a political poem in which Gower, as a loyal subject of Henry IV, approves his coronation, admires him as the saviour of England, dilates on the evil of war and the blessing of peace, and finally begs him to display clemency and seek domestic peace\\" Fisher argued that it was \\"Gower's last important poem. It sums up the final twenty years of both his literary career and his literary achievement.\\" * short Latin works on various subjects with several poems addressed to the new Henry IV. According to Yeager (2005) \\"his final metered thoughts were in Latin, the language that Gower, like most of his contemporaries, associated with timeless authority.\\" Critics have speculated on which late work triggered the royal wine allowance mentioned in the Life section. Candidates are Cronica tripertita, In Praise of Peace, O RecolendeHenry was crowned 13 October 1399. His grant to Gower was doubtless in recognition of the political support reflected in the Chronica Tripertita and other Latin poems. The Epistola brevi (aka O Recolende) (Macaulay, 4:345) would appear to contain an acknowledgement of the grant (lines 19‚Äì21). or an illustrated presentation copy of Confessio with dedication to Henry IV. According to Meyer-Lee \\"no known evidence relates the collar or grant [of wine] to his literary activity.\\" Gower's poetry has had a mixed critical reception. In the 16th century, he was generally regarded alongside Chaucer as the father of English poetry. In the 18th and 19th centuries, however, his reputation declined, largely on account of a perceived didacticism and dullness; e.g. the American poet and critic James Russell Lowell claimed Gower \\"positively raised tediousness to the precision of science\\". After publication of Macaulay's edition (1901) of the complete works, he has received more recognition, notably by C. S. Lewis (1936), Wickert (1953), Fisher (1964), Yeager (1990) and Peck (2006). However, he has not obtained the same following or critical acceptance as Geoffrey Chaucer. Prediction of the Peasants' Revolt When Wickert was attempting to date Vox Clamantis Books Two to Seven, she found two passages which predict the revolt. One is Mirour which uses the metaphor of the stinging nettle to predict the impending catastrophe. The second is the final couplet of Vox Clamantis Book Five Chapter 10. This predicts trouble in a short time. Gower's warnings and call for reform were ignored both before and after the events of 1381. Chaucer influence Chaucer used octosyllabic lines in The House of Fame but eschewed iambic rhythm. He \\"left it to Gower to invent the iambic tetrameter, and to later centuries of poets to solve the problems of its potential monotony; he himself merely polished the traditional Middle English short line.\\" Fisher concludes that they were living near each other in the period 1376 to 1386. They influenced each other in several ways: # They imported Italian models and learned \\"to count beats in such a way as to produce a regular number of syllables.\\" This led via Mirour to the iambic tetrameter of Confessio and Chaucer's pentameter. # After 1376 both poets turned from love poetry to more serious topics. For Gower this was the \\"moralistic social complaint in the Mirour d l'omme and Vox Clamatis, while Chaucer wrestled more painfully in the House of Fame and Parliament of Fowls with the relation between the style and substance of courtly poetry and social satire.\\" # Gower \\"took the risk of composing in English only after Chaucer had achieved success and fame with Troilus and Criseyde.\\" # The most of the individuals in the General Prologue are members of classes criticized in Mirour and Vox Clamantis. Chaucer has omitted the higher ranks of the secular and clerical hierarchies. The language and the introduction of satire are the invention of Chaucer. # Gower is criticized in the Introduction to The Man of Law's Tale. Some commentators have interpreted these remarks to indicate a breach between the two poets. Fisher interprets them and along with the details of the Tale as a friendly competition between two poets. Manuscripts Sebastian Sobecki's discovery of the early provenance of the trilingual Trentham manuscript reveals Gower as a poet who was not afraid to give Henry IV stern political advice. Sobecki also claims to have identified Gower's autograph hand in two manuscripts.Sobecki. \\"Ecce patet tensus: The Trentham Manuscript, In Praise of Peace, and John Gower's Autograph Hand.\\" List of works * Mirour de l'Omme, or Speculum Hominis, or Speculum Meditantis (French, c.1376‚Äì1379) * Vox Clamantis (Latin, c.1377‚Äì1381) * Confessio Amantis (English, c.1386‚Äì1393) * Trait√© pour essampler les amants marietz (French, 1397) * Cinkante Balades (French, 1399‚Äì1400) * Cronica Tripertita (Latin, c.1400) * In praise of peace (English, c.1400)  See also  * Pericles, Prince of Tyre, a play co-written by Shakespeare, based on a story from Confessio Amantis and featuring Gower as the Chorus * Characters named Gower appear in Henry IV Part II and Henry V but there is no reason to associate these characters with the poet. * John Gower is the hero of A Burnable Book and The Invention of Fire, first two of a 14th century thriller series by Bruce Holsinger.

The original idea assumed machines were designed to have this capability, while popularizations have assumed that machines might somehow gain this capability by accident. Self-replicating machines of the macroscopic variety were originally described by mathematician John von Neumann, and are sometimes referred to as von Neumann machines or clanking replicators. The term gray goo was coined by nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. In 2004 he stated, \\"I wish I had never used the term 'gray goo'.\\" Engines of Creation mentions \\"gray goo\\" in two paragraphs and a note, while the popularized idea of gray goo was first publicized in a mass-circulation magazine, Omni, in November 1986.Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life, OMNI, Vol. 9 No. 6, November 1986, p. 56ff. Definition The term was first used by molecular nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in Engines of Creation (1986). In Chapter 4, Engines Of Abundance, Drexler illustrates both exponential growth and inherent limits (not gray goo) by describing nanomachines that can function only if given special raw materials: According to Drexler, the term was popularized by an article in science fiction magazine Omni, which also popularized the term \\"nanotechnology\\" in the same issue. Drexler says arms control is a far greater issue than gray goo \\"nanobugs\\".Dr Eric Drexler - Nanotechnology: The Big Picture In a History Channel broadcast, a contrasting idea (a kind of gray goo) is referred to in a futuristic End time scenario: Drexler describes gray goo in Chapter 11 of Engines of Creation: Drexler notes that the geometric growth made possible by self- replication is inherently limited by the availability of suitable raw materials. Drexler used the term \\"gray goo\\" not to indicate color or texture, but to emphasize the difference between \\"superiority\\" in terms of human values and \\"superiority\\" in terms of competitive success: Bill Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, discussed some of the problems with pursuing this technology in his now-famous 2000 article in Wired magazine, titled \\"Why The Future Doesn't Need Us\\". In direct response to Joy's concerns, the first quantitative technical analysis of the ecophagy scenario was published in 2000 by nanomedicine pioneer Robert Freitas. Risks and precautions Drexler more recently conceded that there is no need to build anything that even resembles a potential runaway replicator. This would avoid the problem entirely. In a paper in the journal Nanotechnology, he argues that self-replicating machines are needlessly complex and inefficient. His 1992 technical book on advanced nanotechnologies Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation describes manufacturing systems that are desktop-scale factories with specialized machines in fixed locations and conveyor belts to move parts from place to place. None of these measures would prevent a party from creating a weaponized gray goo, were such a thing possible. Prince Charles called upon the British Royal Society to investigate the \\"enormous environmental and social risks\\" of nanotechnology in a planned report, leading to much media commentary on gray goo. The Royal Society's report on nanoscience was released on 29 July 2004, and declared the possibility of self-replicating machines to lie too far in the future to be of concern to regulators. More recent analysis in the paper titled Safe Exponential Manufacturing from the Institute of Physics (co-written by Chris Phoenix, Director of Research of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, and Eric Drexler), shows that the danger of gray goo is far less likely than originally thought. However, other long-term major risks to society and the environment from nanotechnology have been identified. Drexler has made a somewhat public effort to retract his gray goo hypothesis, in an effort to focus the debate on more realistic threats associated with knowledge-enabled nanoterrorism and other misuses. In Safe Exponential Manufacturing, which was published in a 2004 issue of Nanotechnology, it was suggested that creating manufacturing systems with the ability to self-replicate by the use of their own energy sources would not be needed. The Foresight Institute also recommended embedding controls in the molecular machines. These controls would be able to prevent anyone from purposely abusing nanotechnology, and therefore avoid the gray goo scenario. Ethics and chaos Gray goo is a useful construct for considering low-probability, high-impact outcomes from emerging technologies. Thus, it is a useful tool in the ethics of technology. Daniel A. Vallero applied it as a worst-case scenario thought experiment for technologists contemplating possible risks from advancing a technology. This requires that a decision tree or event tree include even extremely low probability events if such events may have an extremely negative and irreversible consequence, i.e. application of the precautionary principle. Dianne Irving admonishes that \\"any error in science will have a rippling effect\\". Vallero adapted this reference to chaos theory to emerging technologies, wherein slight permutations of initial conditions can lead to unforeseen and profoundly negative downstream effects, for which the technologist and the new technology's proponents must be held accountable.

June 12, 1524) was a Spanish conquistador. He conquered and governed Cuba on behalf of Spain and moved Havana from the south coast of western Cuba to the north coast, placing it well as a port for Spanish trade.Allan J. Kuethe, \\"Havana\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3, p. 173. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Early life Little is known about the early life of Diego Vel√°zquez.Jacquelyn Briggs Kent, \\"Diego de Vel√°squez\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 5. p. 375. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. He was born in Cu√©llar c. 1465, in the Segovia region of Spain. Vel√°zquez was known for his hatred of manual labor from a young age, which played a role in him eventually becoming a conquistador. Diego Vel√°zquez was a part of the Spanish military, serving in Naples, and then returning to Spain to serve in Seville. Vel√°zquez was met with all the excitement from Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the new world, so Vel√°zquez made sure he was on the second voyage of Christopher Columbus. Vel√°zquez settled on the island of Espanola, where he befriended Bartholomew Columbus, the younger brother of Christopher. Columbus took a liking to Vel√°zquez and when Columbus had to leave the island for any period of time would make Vel√°zquez acting governor of the Indies. Vel√°zquez squashed an Indian revolt in 1503 by sending a captain to a part of the island while he went and captured the king of the revolting Indians which ended the revolt. The Governor of the Indies at this time was Nicol√°s de Ovando y C√°ceres, and after the revolt decided that five new towns should be built. Vel√°zquez helped form three of these towns, the names of the towns were Salvatierra de la Zabana, Y√°quimo, and San Juan de la Maguana. According to historian Troy S. Floyd, \\"Vel√°zquez himself, reportedly wealthy in island terms by 1511, held encomiendas at Verapaz, Salvatierra de la Zabana, and Santiago de Caballeros, where he was in partnership with an unidentified encomendero in mining enterprises.\\" He married the daughter of Crist√≥bal de Cu√©llar, who died soon afterwards. He never remarried. Conquest of Cuba He was named to lead the expedition of conquest of Cuba in 1511, with 300 men, a three-year undertaking noted for its brutality.Kent, \\"Diego de Vel√°squez\\", p. 375. He acted under orders from Diego Columbus, recently restored as Viceroy of the Indies. He founded a number of new Spanish settlements and cities on the island, first Baracoa in 1511 and then most notably Santiago de Cuba in 1514 and Havana in 1515. Vel√°zquez was appointed Governor of Cuba.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, The new settlers did not wish to be under the personal authority of Diego Columbus, so Vel√°zquez convoked a general cabildo (a local government council) which was duly authorized to deal directly with Spain, and therefore removed Vel√°zquez and the settlers from under the authority of Columbus, their nominal superior. It was a precedent that would come back to haunt him with the Mexican adventures. Conquest of Mexico He authorized various expeditions to explore lands further west, including the 1517 Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba expedition to Yucat√°n (see: Spanish Conquest of Yucat√°n), and Juan de Grijalva's 1518 expedition. He was made the first Adelantado of Cuba with jurisdiction over the former Governorship of the Indies. He initially backed Hern√°n Cort√©s's expedition to Mexico, but pulled back his support before the expedition was scheduled to launch. Cort√©s disobeyed Vel√°zquez's orders to disband his expeditionary force and left for Mexico anyway. Later life Vel√°zquez lost his governorship of Cuba in 1521, for his misuse of indigenous labor, but he was restored to office in 1523. At the time of his unexpected death in 1524 at age 59, he was \\"the richest Spaniard in the Americas,\\" despite financial losses on the expedition of Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba and of Hern√°n Cort√©s. He completed the successful conquest of Cuba, founded towns that remain important, made Cuba economically prosperous, and turned it into the staging point for expeditions of conquest elsewhere.Kent, \\"Diego de Vel√°squez\\" p. 375.

Biography  = Early life = Ludlam was born in Floral Park, New York, the son of Marjorie (n√©e Braun) and Joseph William Ludlam. He was raised in Greenlawn, New York, and attended Harborfields High School. He was openly gay, and performed in plays with the Township Theater Group, a community theatre in Huntington, and worked backstage at the Red Barn Theater, a summer stock theatre in Northport. During his senior year of high school, Ludlam directed, produced, and performed plays with a group of friends, students from Huntington, Northport, Greenlawn, and Centerport. Their \\"Students Repertory Theatre\\", housed in the loft studio beneath the Posey School of Dance on Main Street in Northport, seated an audience of 25, and was sold out for every performance. Their repertoire included Kan Kikuchi's Madman on the Roof; Theatre of the Soul; a readers' theatre adaptation of Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology; and plays by August Strindberg and Eugene O'Neill. He received a degree in dramatic literature from Hofstra University in 1964. At Hofstra, Ludlam met Black-Eyed Susan, whom he cast in one of his college productions. The two became close friends, and Black-Eyed Susan performed in more of Ludlam's plays over the following decades than any other actor, except Ludlam himself. = Career = Ludlam joined John Vaccaro's Play-House of the Ridiculous, and after a falling out, founded his own Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1967. His first plays were rudimentary exercises; starting with Bluebeard, he began writing more structured plays, which were often pastiches of gothic novels; works by Federico Garcia Lorca, Shakespeare, and Richard Wagner; and popular culture and old movies. These works were humorous but had serious undertones. After seeing one of Ludlam's plays, theater critic Brendan Gill famously remarked, \\"This isn't farce. This isn't absurd. This is absolutely ridiculous!\\". Ludlam commented on his own work: > I would say that my work falls into the classical tradition of comedy. Over > the years there have been certain traditional approaches to comedy. As a > modern artist you have to advance the tradition. I want to work within the > tradition so that I don't waste my time trying to establish new conventions. > You can be very original within the established conventions. Ludlam's Bluebeard was produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, where Vaccaro's company was in residence, in March 1970. Ludlam performed in this production as Khanazar von Bluebeard. Black-Eyed-Susan, Lola Pashalinski, and Mario Montez also performed in this production.La MaMa Archives Digital Collections. \\"Production: 'Ridiculous Theater Company Presents: Bluebeard' (1970)\\". Accessed May 16, 2018. He taught and/or staged productions at New York University, Connecticut College, Yale University, and Carnegie Mellon University. He won fellowships from the Guggenheim, Rockefeller, and Ford Foundations, and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. He won six Obie Awards over the course of his career, including a Sustained Excellence Obie Award two weeks before his death in 1987, and won the Rosamund Gilder Award for distinguished achievement in the theater in 1986. Ludlam often appeared in his plays, and was particularly noted for his female roles. He wrote one of the first plays to address, though indirectly, the AIDS epidemic. His most well-known play is The Mystery of Irma Vep, in which two actors play seven roles in a pastiche of gothic horror novels. The original production featured Ludlam and his partner Everett Quinton. Rights to perform the play include a stipulation that the actors must be of the same sex, in order to ensure cross-dressing in the production. In 1991, Irma Vep was the most produced play in the United States; and in 2003, it became the longest-running production ever staged in Brazil.Gussow, Mel. \\"Books of the Times; The Roman-Candle Life of a Downtown Original\\", The New York Times, January 29, 2003Scheib, Ronnie. \\"Irma Vep - She's Back!\\", Variety, August 21, 2006 Ludlam was diagnosed with AIDS in March 1987. He attempted to fight the disease with his lifelong interest in healthy eating and a macrobiotic diet, but died a month after his AIDS diagnosis, of PCP pneumonia, at St. Vincent's Hospital. His front page obituary in the New York Times was the newspaper's first page 1 obituary to specifically name AIDS as a cause of death (with Ludlam's parents' consent), instead of the AIDS-related illnesses such as pneumonia commonly cited at the time.The block in front of his Sheridan Square theater was renamed \\"Charles Ludlam Lane\\" in his honor. In 2009, Ludlam was inducted posthumously into the American Theater Hall of Fame. After his death, \\"Walter Ego\\", the dummy from Ludlam's 1978 play The Ventriloquist's Wife, was donated to the Vent Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, where it remains on exhibit; the puppet was designed and built by actor and puppetmaker Alan Semok.

The Nine Network is one of five main free-to-air networks in Australia. As of 2019, the Nine Network is the highest-rating television network in Australia, ahead of the Seven Network, Network 10, ABC, and SBS. Since 2017, the network's slogan has been \\"We Are the One\\". History =Origins= TCN-9 was launched on 16 September 1956 by The Daily Telegraph owner Frank Packer. John Godson introduced the station and Bruce Gyngell presented the first programme, This Is Television (so becoming the first person to appear on Australian television). Later that year, GTV-9 in Melbourne commenced transmissions to broadcast the 1956 Summer Olympics, later forming the National Television Network alongside QTQ-9 in Brisbane in 1959 and NWS-9 in Adelaide, the basis of the current Nine Network, in 1959. Before its formation, TCN-9 was then affiliated with HSV-7 (because they were both Australia's first television stations, having been opened in 1956), and GTV-9's sister affiliate was ATN-7. By 1967, the network had begun calling itself the \\"National Nine Network\\", and became simply the \\"Nine Network Australia\\" in 1988. Kerry Packer inherited the company after his father's death in 1974. Before the official conversion to colour on 1 March 1975, it was the first Australian television station to regularly screen programmes in colour with the first program to use it premiering in 1971, the very year NTD-8 in Darwin opened its doors. In 1967, the New South Wales Rugby Football League grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network paid $5,000 () for the broadcasting rights. In the late 1980s, STW-9 Perth, which opened in 1965, became a Nine Network owned-and-operated station when Bond Media purchased the network. However, in 1989, Bond Media sold the Perth-based station to Sunraysia Television for A$95 million, due to the federal cross-media ownership laws which restricted the level of national reach for media owners. In 2011, GTV 9 Melbourne moved from 22 Bendigo Street, Richmond, to 717 Bourke Street, Docklands. 22 Bendigo Street started out as the Wertheim Piano Factory, then became the Heinz Soup Factory, then GTV9. The building in Bendigo Street still stands, now as luxury apartments. =1977‚Äì2006: The golden era= Nine began using the slogan \\"Let Us Be The One\\" (based on The Carpenters song, later used by ABC in the United States) in 1977 and became the number-one free-to-air network in Australia; its National Nine News became the most-watched news service. In 1978, Nine switched its slogan to \\"Still the One\\" (modelled on the campaign used by ABC in the United States), which lasted until a decline in ratings in January 2006. During the 1980s, Nine's ratings peaked. From 1999 to 2001, the network began losing ground to the Seven network in news and entertainment, but received a boost after the coverage of the 11 September attacks in 2001. The death of CEO Kerry Packer in 2005 triggered more problems for the network. Digital terrestrial television was introduced on 1 January 2001. =2006‚Äì2008: Nine loses to Seven= Nine stayed strong throughout 2003-04, winning 77 out of 80 ratings weeks across those two years (with Network Ten claiming the other three weeks), but was hit hard when Seven introduced a new line-up in 2005, though Nine finished ahead of Seven that year. Meanwhile, National Nine News was overtaken by Seven News for the first time ever, while Today was beaten by Seven's fledgling Sunrise program. In 2006, Nine continued on its downward trend, losing most news weeks to Seven News and just winning the year thanks to its coverage of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. To try to revitalise the network in its 50th anniversary, Nine adopted a new, but critically received, logo that removed the nine dots, which had been part of the network's identity since 1970. In May 2007, Nine partially reintroduced the Nine dots, which resulted in the square logo changing into a three-dimensional (3D) cube that rotates, with the dots visible on every second side of the cube. After a period of declining ratings, David Gyngell returned to the job of chief executive officer in October 2007, succeeding Eddie McGuire. In 2007, despite several hits, Seven won the whole year by a significant margin. The Seven Network had won 38 weeks, whereas the Nine Network only won two. The Network expanded into Northern NSW with the acquisition on NBN Television in May 2007. However, NBN was retained as an independent Nine affiliate following the acquisition. Deborah Wright who had been doing various roles for the station was promoted to CEO. =2008‚Äì2015: Expanding digital services= In 2008, as part of a major relaunch, the network dropped the blue box, and reinstated its nine dots in its logo, with a 3D look. After losing viewers to Seven News, Nine relaunched its news service as Nine News, which managed to win more weeks over Seven in the first half of 2008. Nine also launched a break-out hit, Underbelly, which attracted over 2.5 million viewers in its first season. Nine tried to attract younger demographics, so while Seven went on to win the ratings year in total people, Nine was rated the number one network in the key 18‚Äì49 and 25‚Äì54 demographics. In March 2008, The Nine Network launched a high definition channel called Nine HD on channel 90 until 2010. In 2009, Nine started relatively strongly due to the top-rating Australian drama Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities and the Twenty20 Cricket series until Nine lost the rights in 2018, but could not hold its audience after Network Ten's MasterChef Australia became a hit. Nine became inconsistent with scheduling and removal of programmes. Nine also launched a number of reality shows, including Ladette to Lady, Wipeout Australia, HomeMADE, Australia's Perfect Couple, and The Apprentice Australia, in the hope of achieving the same success other networks had with the genre. All the new formats underperformed in the ratings and did not help the network establish any stable local content. Nine also expanded its news strand with the reintroduction of a late-night bulletin (for its owned-and-operated stations), an extended morning bulletin and weekend editions of Today. The flagship 6:00 pm state bulletins continued to fall in the ratings, though its Melbourne bulletin remained competitive, being the only market to win any weeks against Seven News. In August 2009, Nine launched its own digital multi- channel called GO! on Channel 99, primarily aimed at a younger demographic. The shares from GO! contributed to Nine's weekly shares and allowed it to enjoy several weeks of weekly ratings wins. In September, the network took on a new slogan, \\"Welcome Home\\", and revamped its graphic package. With the resurgence of Nine News, growth of Today, stabilisation of 60 Minutes and a new programme line-up consisting of Hey Hey It's Saturday, Underbelly and Sea Patrol, Nine enjoyed more ratings success. In 2010, Nine obtained the rights to exclusive coverage of the Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks. GO! won the year in digital shares only. On 26 September 2010, Nine launched their third digital channel GEM (an acronym of General Entertainment and Movies) on Channel 90. In 2011, the Nine Network announced a new \\"Home of Comedy\\" line-up with comedy shows such as Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, and other American sitcoms, along with the launch of a live comedy show Ben Elton Live From Planet Earth, which was cancelled after only three episodes due to low ratings. Nine also brought back This Is Your Life with Eddie McGuire as host, although the series was cancelled after airing four episodes. The Nine Network had success in the ratings in the second half of 2011 with The Block, Underbelly: Razor, and The Celebrity Apprentice Australia. The highly anticipated return of a revamped ninth season of Two and a Half Men proved a huge success for the network, generating 2.3 million viewers and dominating the week as top program.2.3m for Two and a Half Men TV Tonight, 21 September 2011 The return of new episodes of the popular sitcom The Big Bang Theory was also a huge success for the network, scoring high figures consistently week after week and dominating the evening as top program. Despite this, the Nine Network finished in second place in the ratings again in 2011 on 19.6%, behind the Seven Network (23.1%) and ahead of the Network Ten (15.9%), ABC (12.2%) and SBS (4.6%).Free To Air TV Ratings For The Year 2011 Throng, 26 November 2011 On 24 November 2011, the Nine Network announced the line-up for 2012, with a focus on reality programs, including an Australian version of The Voice, the return of Big Brother, Excess Baggage, and The Celebrity Apprentice Australia.Nine's Home of Excitement in 2012. The Voice, Excess Baggage, Big Brother, more Underbelly, Celebrity Apprentice and The Block Throng, 24 November 2011 The Nine Network also aired coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. A new morning show, Mornings, replaced the departure of Kerri-Anne Kennerley's self-titled show, after nine years on air. The program, now called Today Extra, is hosted by Sylvia Jeffreys and David Campbell. On 26 March 2012, the Nine Network launched Extra, a new channel aimed at delivering home shopping, brand funded, religious, community, educational and multi-cultural programming content created by advertisers. It was reported on 31 May 2012 that the Australian telecommunications company Telstra and WIN Television Network CEO, Bruce Gordon, are considering making a takeover bid for Nine Entertainment.Telstra eyes troubled Nine television network The Australian, 31 May 2012 Bruce Gordon explores possible Nine bid Business Spectator, 13 June 2012 The network currently is trying to fight off administration as it deals with a debt exceeding A$3.3 billion. It was reported on 3 June 2013 that the Nine Network would immediately purchase Adelaide affiliate NWS-9 from the WIN Corporation as part of a deal to secure international cricket television rights. On 3 July 2013, it was reported that Nine would exercise an option to also buy STW-9 from WIN Corporation. Both purchases have resulted in these stations being, once again, O&O; stations of the network for the first time since the 1980s. As of 10 December 2013, Nine no longer broadcasts on analogue TV and is now only available through digital TV or digital set-top box. On 27 January 2014, the Nine Network have stopped using the Supertext logo and have switched to their own Closed Captioning logo. =2015‚Äì2019: A new era in television= On 26 November 2015, Nine relaunched 9HD, an HD simulcast of their primary channel, on channel 90 and launched new lifestyle channel 9Life on channel 94. In addition to the relaunch of 9HD, GEM (renamed 9Gem) was reduced to standard definition and moved to channel 92 and GO! (renamed 9Go!) was moved to channel 93. On 16 December 2015, Nine also changed its on-air theme for a continuous design across all of its channels with the Nine News/9news.com.au branding to remain unchanged. This included a new look for program listings, program advertisements and promos. Additionally in November 2015, Hugh Marks replaced David Gyngell as CEO. On 27 January 2016, Nine's online catch-up video on-demand service 9Jumpin was retired and replaced by 9Now. 9Now offers a range of content larger than 9Jumpin and also offers a live streaming service for Nine's multicast channels. Live streaming for Nine was launched on the same day, with streaming for 9Gem, 9Go! and 9Life launched on 19 May 2016. Following the launch of 9Now, the WIN Corporation, owner of Nine affiliate WIN Television, filed a lawsuit against Nine Entertainment Co., claiming that live streaming into regional areas breaches their affiliation agreement. The case was later dismissed on 28 April 2016 with Justice Hammerschlag of the NSW Supreme Court stating that, \\"I have concluded that live streaming is not broadcasting within the meaning of the PSA (program supply agreement), and that Nine is under no express or implied obligation not to do it.\\" Following their victory in the 9Now court case, Nine Entertainment Co. announced on 29 April 2016 that it had signed a $500 million five year affiliation deal with Southern Cross Austereo, the then-primary regional affiliate of Network Ten. On 1 July 2016, WIN Television lost its Nine affiliate status to Southern Cross, which had Nine's metropolitan branding introduced across its now Nine-branded television assets. Nine later secured an affiliate deal with Mildura Digital Television, a joint venture between WIN and Prime Media Group, on 28 June 2016 to supply Nine content to the Mildura and Sunraysia area due to WIN switching affiliation to Network Ten. Nine finalised supply deals with WIN for South Australia and Griffith on 29 June 2016 after long negotiations, with a deal for Tasmanian joint venture TDT secured the following day after long negotiations. A supply deal for Western Australia joint venture West Digital Television was not secured before the 1 July 2016 deadline, but a deal was later finalised on 2 July 2016 with programming resuming that night. Also after 10 years as an independent affiliate, NBN Television was finally folded in to the Nine Network with the NBN logo being retired on air after 54 years. However despite being a Nine O&O;, NBN News remains as an independent news bulletin, despite adopting the full Nine News on air look. In June 2018, it was announced that Nine would enter into a joint venture with Australian News Channel (ANC) to create Your Money, a business news channel that was replaced the Sky News Business Channel on Foxtel channel 601 and also available free-to-air through Nine on channel 95, replacing Extra. However, it closed on 17 May 2019 due to lack of advertising & poor ratings. In August 2019, In a huge week for local announcements, Disney confirmed its service will arrive in Australia in November, Apple ramped up its original-content budget to $US6 billion ($8.9 billion) ahead of launch later this year, Nine-owned Stan signed a deal with Paramount, Amazon commissioned its first Australian series and Seven West Media told investors it is keen to get back in the game after earlier misfires. The success of Netflix in disrupting the pay-TV world that Foxtel ruled down under has now spawned a plethora of on-demand entertainment options, with media companies and viewers scrambling to make the new era work for them. Stan is owned by Nine, publisher of The Australian Financial Review, and its Paramount TV deal, signed earlier in the week, included a number of shows that have been commissioned for Disney's Hulu and AT&T;'s HBO Max in the US. Nine Entertainment‚Äôs streaming service Stan looks like losing out in the battle for movie content dominance. The platform recently inked a deal with Paramount Pictures to give it extra content in the struggle for market share with Netflix. That deal would give Stan exclusive rights to some of Paramount‚Äôs best known-films, including Mission: Impossible, Transformers, Star Trek and Top Gun. However, the now completed merger between Paramount Pictures‚Äô parent company Viacom and network giant CBS, which now owns Network Ten, has cast doubt on the value of the Stan-Paramount partnership. On 21 November 2019, TV Tonight reported that Kids' WB had been axed and that production on the series would conclude within two weeks. It was stated that the cancellation of the series was due to the expiry of the Nine Network's long-running output deal with Warner Bros because the studio has so many of Warner Bros programs in this network and wants to make room for the other programs of NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS. The final episode aired on 29 November 2019, ending the show's 13-year run. =2019-Present: Return to the top= After 12 years, the Nine Network won the 2019 ratings year for the first time since 2006. The Seven Network had won every ratings year between 2007 and 2018 inclusive, however, due to lower than expected ratings, and a launch of new programs not performing as hoped, this allowed Nine to regain lost ground during the most competitive times of the ratings period (most notably, Nine's Married At First Sight performed above expectations, and consistently beat My Kitchen Rules which saw its lowest figures on record) which resulted in Nine's first win in the first quarter since 2009.https://tvtonight.com.au/2019/10/seven-set-for-730-stripped-programming- across-2020.htmlhttps://tvtonight.com.au/2019/01/married-at-first-sight-beats- my-kitchen-rules-return.html Nine's yearly share for 2019 concluded at 29.4%, a 2.1% increase from 2018 (27.3%) compared to Seven's 29.0%, a 1.7% decline from 2018 (30.7%)https://www.smh.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/nine-emerges- from-the-ratings-wilderness-to-snatch-seven-s-lead-with-a-steady- ship-20191201-p53fu2.html In 2020, despite drastic and last minute changes to most network‚Äôs programming schedules in light of the COVID-19 pandemic the Nine Network has managed to retain the number one lead by a considerable margin. On March 27, 2020, Nine formally acknowledged in an online article that the Nine logo animation had been altered to encourage social distancing throughout the COVID-19 crisis. The animation displayed each of the Nine dots spreading out across the screen.https://www.9news.com.au/world/coronavirus- social-distancing-redesign-brand-logos-nine-mcdonalds-nike-audi- volkswagon/4c02286d-6ef8-4c0c-a16d-01e346744ded So far, the Nine Network has completed a clean sweep of each ratings week in Q1 of 2020, with the Seven Network yet to win a ratings week. In April 2020, Nine launched 9Rush a multichannel described as ‚ÄúHigh adrenaline reality‚Äù under a joint venture with Discovery, Inc. from which the channel draws its content.https://tvtonight.com.au/2020/03/9rush-channel-to-launch-with- adrenaline-reality.html Programming =Local programs= The Nine Network apart from its News and Current Affairs division, broadcasts a range of entertainment programming of various genre's from Australian and overseas sources.

Since 2015 the network has cut ties with Warner Bros. Television, losing the networks rights to Arrow, Gotham, Mom and Two Broke Girls among many others. On 11 March 2015, Nine revived their rights for Nickelodeon International because the studio now allows new broadcast rights, but they share with 10 and ABC. On 22 February 2020, DreamWorks films are now returned to Nine Network after 8 years was absence, as well as Paramount films (ViacomCBS films) is now moved from 10 to Nine because NBCUniversal is ultimately reunited with DreamWorks after 15 years was separated each other (starting with DreamWorks 25 Anniversary) and also Network 10 was a part of ViacomCBS Australia & New Zealand and therefore had access to programming from Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon, along with Channel 5 in the United Kingdom and Telefe in Argentina.

News and popular affairs = History = A Nine Network journalist interviewing an Australian soldier in Iraq during 2017 The set of Nine News Perth The Nine Network's news service is Nine News (previously National Nine News).

The simulcast was relaunched as a breakaway multichannel 9HD on 17 March 2008 but was reverted to a simulcast on 3 August 2009 and was later replaced by GEM (now 9Gem) on 26 September 2010. 9HD was revived as a 1080i HD simulcast of Nine on 26 November 2015 on channel 90, bumping 9Gem to SD on channel 92. =9Now= 9Now logo 9Now is a video on demand, catch up TV service run by the Nine Network. The service became available on 27 January 2016, replacing Nine's previous service 9Jumpin. 9Now also offers online live streaming for Channel 9, 9Gem, 9Go!, 9Life and 9Rush. The Olympic news on Today and Nine News don't broadcast live streaming due to the IOC rights instead it replaces the message board until Olympic news finishes and returning to normal programming. Logo and identity history The Nine Network logo, which consists of a numeral \\"9\\" beside nine dots arranged in a 3x3 grid, is one of the most recognisable logos in Australia.Desktop Magazine ‚Äì Nine Network In 1997, the dots were changed to spheres. The spheres returned to dots as a new on-air identity package was created by Velvet mediendesign in 2001.Velvet mediendesign ‚Äì Nine Network Rebrand 2001 This logo was redesigned by Velvet Mediendesign on 1 January 2001, with the introduction of digital TV in Australia and new graphics. On 1 September 2002, the dots were changed back to spheres from the 1997 logo as well as the numeral becoming 3D for their \\"7 colours for 7 days\\" presentation package. On 30 January 2006, the network and its affiliates relaunched their logos to coincide with Nine's 50th anniversary. A numeral nine was reworked with a few rounded corners eliminated in process. This logo would use a blue square featuring the numeral altered, which saw the removal of the nine dots again. The graphics package used during that time was designed by Bruce Dunlop Associates. Later on 15 January 2007 the blue square became solid, and in May they partially relaunched the nine dots, which are visible on every second surface of the box. This logo continued to be used in Perth and Adelaide stations until March 2010, when they reinstated the nine-dots logo. On 14 January 2008, Nine completely reinstated the nine dots logo, but with a different design. The slogan used with this logo was \\"we‚ô•TV\\", which had also been used in December 2007 with the previous logo. This time, the dots are now a bit bigger, like the 1970s logo and the numeral 9 from the previous 2006 logo would continue. This logo would first be used in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Darwin markets but the logo would not used in both Perth and Adelaide markets, until March 2010, due to being owned by WIN Corporation at the same time. As a part of a major relaunch, the entire logo became 3D on the same day as part of a short-lived rebrand. The nine dots are represented by translucent 3D discs during that year. The music used throughout the network's ID's and promotions was \\"Smile\\"' by The Supernaturals, released in 1997. This logo would only be used in 4 metropolitan markets. On 1 February 2009, the dots are once again 2D as part of a short-lived rebrand, which lasted until 26 September. On 27 September, the dots are changed to spheres from the 1997 logo yet again when the network's original slogan \\"Welcome Home\\" was launched. It also began to re-use the iconic \\"Still The One\\" theme tune from 1992 in one of the ID's. The dots is smaller, like the previous 2001 logo and in March 2010, the dots were reinstated in both Perth and Adelaide markets. On 15 April 2012 during the premiere of The Voice, Nine changed its identity to apply the logo in different colours such as blue, red, green, purple, yellow and orange. It is also reminiscent of the 2002 ID package from the 2001 logo, and coincidentally the identity for the network has been launched a decade ago. However, In April 2020, the network launched a tongue-in-cheek station ident which depicted the 9 dots being spaced out to promote Social Distancing, a lawful enforcement by the Australian Government in response to COVID-19, concluding with the hashtag #SlowTheSpread File:Nine (1970).svg9 July 1970 ‚Äì 31 December 2000 (secondary until 29 January 2006) File:Nine2001.svg1 January 2001 ‚Äì 29 January 2006 File:Nine2006.svg30 January 2006 ‚Äì 13 January 2008 File:Nine2008.svg14 January 2008 ‚Äì present (used as a secondary logo) File:Nine2012 Glossed Logo.png15 April 2012 ‚Äì present Slogans *Summer 1971/1972: Have a Happy Summer (GTV-9 only) *1972: Get the Channel 9 Feeling! *1973: This is the Place to Be in '73 *Winter 1974: Come Home to Us This Winter (GTV-9 only) *1975 - 1976: Living Color *1977 : Let Us Be The One (previously used by American Broadcasting Company in 1976) *1978, 1980 ‚Äì December 2006: Still The One (also used by the American Broadcasting Company in 1977 and 1979, WIN Television from 1989 to December 2006, NBN Television from 1994 to December 2006 and GMV6, BTV6, VTV and TasTV in the 1990s) *1979 ‚Äì 31 May 2006: This is Channel 9 *1979: We're The One (previously used by American Broadcasting Company in 1978) *1980: The National Nine Network, First in Australia *Sept. 16, 1981: 25 Years of Television. *1982: Number One For Me.

Utilized in many treaty regimes involving trade and intellectual property, it requires equal treatment of foreigners and locals. Under national treatment, a state that grants particular rights, benefits or privileges to its own citizens must also grant those advantages to the citizens of other states while they are in that country. In the context of international agreements, a state must provide equal treatment to citizens of the other states participating in the agreement. Imported and locally produced goods should be treated equally ‚Äî at least after the foreign goods have entered the market. While this is generally viewed as a desirable principle, in custom it conversely means that a state can deprive foreigners of anything of which it deprives its own citizens. An opposing principle calls for an international minimum standard of justice (a sort of basic due process) that would provide a base floor for the protection of rights and of access to judicial process. The conflict between national treatment and minimum standards has mainly played out between industrialized and developing nations, in the context of expropriations. Many developing nations, having the power to take control over the property of their own citizens, wished to exercise it over the property of aliens as well. Though support for national treatment was expressed in several controversial (and legally non-binding) United Nations General Assembly resolutions, the issue of expropriations is almost universally handled through treaties with other states and contracts with private entities, rather than through reliance upon international custom. National treatment only applies once a product, service or item of intellectual property has entered the market. Therefore, charging customs duty on an import is not a violation of national treatment even if locally-produced products are not charged an equivalent tax. There is evidence that the national treatment principle is not being upheld, at least as far as intellectual property is concerned. However, some mechanisms such as TRIPs seem to reduce bias against foreigners. Furthermore, apparent discrimination against foreigners may be the result of a disparate impact of the local legislation on foreigners (\\"unintentional discrimination\\") rather than disparate treatment (\\"intentional discrimination\\"). GATT/WTO National treatment is an integral part of many World Trade Organization agreements. Together with the most favoured nation principle, national treatment is one of the cornerstones of WTO trade law. It is found in all 3 of the main WTO agreements (GATT, GATS and TRIPS). National treatment is a basic principle of GATT/WTO that prohibits discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods with respect to internal taxation or other government regulation. The principle of national treatment is formulated in Article 3 of the GATT 1947The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/gatt47_01_e.htm (and incorporated by reference in GATT 1994); Article 17 of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); and in Article 3 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The aim of this trade rule is to prevent internal taxes or other regulations from being used as a substitute for tariff protection.CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905 A good summary is found in Japan-AlcoholReport of the WTO Appellate Body 1994 http://www.worldtradelaw.net/reports/wtoab/japan-alcohol(ab).pdf which states; \\"[a] national treatment obligation is a general prohibition on the use of internal taxes and other internal regulatory measures so as to afford protection to domestic production\\".

His gravestone, as quoted by Gal Ed, Megilas Yuchsin and others, gives his date of death as Thursday 18 Elul 5369.), widely known to scholars of Judaism as the Maharal of Prague, or simply The Maharal, the Hebrew acronym of \\"Moreinu Ha- Rav Loew\\" (\\"Our Teacher, Rabbi Loew\\"), was an important Talmudic scholar, Jewish mystic, and philosopher who, for most of his life, served as a leading rabbi in the cities of Mikulov in Moravia and Prague in Bohemia. Within the world of Torah and Talmudic scholarship, Loew is known for his works on Jewish philosophy and Jewish mysticism and his work Gur Aryeh al HaTorah, a supercommentary on Rashi's Torah commentary. He is also the subject of a 19th- century legend that he created the Golem of Prague, an animate mythological being fashioned from clay. Rabbi Loew is buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague in Josefov, where his grave and intact tombstone can still be visited. His descendants' surnames include Braude, Leib, Lev, Lew, Loewy, Loeb, Lowy, Lowi, Low-Beer, Loew, Oppenheimer, Pfaelzer, Schneerson, Lowenstein, Gurary and Keim. Biography Old New Synagogue, Prague where he officiated Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague The Maharal was probably born in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland,‚Äîthough Perels lists the birth town mistakenly as Worms in the Holy Roman Empire‚Äîto Rabbi Bezalel (Loew), whose family originated from the Rhenish town of Worms. His birth year is uncertain, with different sources listing 1512, 1520 and 1526. His uncle Jakob ben Chajim was Reichsrabbiner (\\"Rabbi of the Empire\\") of the Holy Roman Empire, his brother Chaim of Friedberg a famous rabbinical scholar. There is no documented evidence of his having received formal religious education, leading scholars to conclude that he was an extremely gifted autodidact.YIVO Encyclopedia - Yehudah Leib ben Betsalel. His family consisted of his wife, Pearl, six daughters, and a son, Bezalel, who became a Rabbi in Kol√≠n, but died early in 1600. He was independently wealthy, probably as a result of his father's successful business enterprises. He accepted a rabbinical position in 1553 as Landesrabbiner of Moravia at Mikulov (Nikolsburg), directing community affairs but also determining which tractate of the Talmud was to be studied in the communities in that province. He also revised the community statutes on the election and taxation process. Although he retired from Moravia in 1588 at age 68, the communities still considered him an authority long after that. One of his activities in Moravia was the rallying against slanderous slurs on legitimacy (Nadler) that were spread in the community against certain families and could ruin the finding of a marriage partner for the children of those families. This phenomenon even affected his own family. He used one of the two yearly grand sermons (between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur 1583) to denounce the phenomenon. He moved back to Prague in 1588, where he again accepted a rabbinical position, replacing the retired Isaac Hayoth. He immediately reiterated his views on Nadler. On 23 February 1592, he had an audience with Emperor Rudolf II, which he attended together with his brother Sinai and his son-in-law Isaac Cohen; Prince Bertier was present with the emperor. The conversation seems to have been related to Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism, Hebrew: ◊ß÷∑◊ë÷∏÷º◊ú÷∏◊î) a subject which held much fascination for the emperor. In 1592, the Maharal moved to Pozna≈Ñ, where he had been elected as Chief Rabbi of Poland. In Pozna≈Ñ he composed Netivoth Olam and part of Derech Chaim (see below). Towards the end of his life he moved back to Prague, where he died in 1609. He was buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague. His name Coat of arms of Bohemia His name \\"L√∂w\\" or \\"Loew\\", derived from the German L√∂we, \\"lion\\" (cf. the Yiddish Leib of the same origin), is a kinnui or substitute name for the Hebrew Judah or Yehuda, as this name‚Äîoriginally of the tribe of Judah‚Äîis traditionally associated with a lion. In the Book of Genesis, the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh, a \\"Young Lion\\" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him.http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK;=1&CHAPTER;=49 In Jewish naming tradition the Hebrew name and the substitute name are often combined as a pair, as in this case. The Maharal's classic work on the Rashi commentary of the Torah is called the Gur Aryeh al HaTorah in Hebrew, meaning \\"Young Lion [commenting] upon the Torah\\". The Maharal's tomb in Prague is decorated with a heraldic shield with a lion with two intertwined tails (queue fourchee), alluding both to his first name and to Bohemia, the arms of which has a two-tailed lion. Influence =Disciples= It is unknown how many Talmudic rabbinical scholars the Maharal taught in Moravia, but the main disciples from the Prague period include Rabbis Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller and David Gans. The former promoted his teacher's program of regular Mishnah study by the masses, and composed his Tosefoth Yom Tov (a Mishnah commentary incorporated into almost all published editions of the Mishnah over the past few hundred years) with this goal in mind. David Ganz died young, but produced the work Tzemach David, a work of Jewish and general history, as well as writing on astronomy; both the MaHaRal and Ganz were in contact with Tycho Brahe, the famous astronomer. =Jewish philosophy= In the words of a modern writer, the Maharal \\"prevented the Balkanization of Jewish thought\\".Yitzchok Adlerstein 2000, citing Rabbi Nachman Bulman His works inspired the Polish branch of Hasidism, as well as a more recent wave of Torah scholars originating from Lithuania and Latvia, most markedly Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler (1892‚Äì1953) as well as Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1864‚Äì1935). A more recent authority who had roots in both traditions was Rabbi Isaac Hutner (1906‚Äì1980). Rabbi Hutner succinctly defined the ethos of the Maharal's teachings as being Nistar BeLashon Nigleh, meaning (in Hebrew): \\"The Hidden in the language of the Revealed\\". That is, the Maharal couched kabbalistic ideas in non-kabbalistic language. As a mark of his devotion to the ways of the Maharal, Rabbi Hutner bestowed the name of the Maharal's key work the Gur Aryeh upon a branch of the yeshiva he headed when he established its kollel (a yeshiva for post-graduate Talmud scholars) which then became a division of the Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in New York during the 1950s, known as Kollel Gur Aryeh. Both of these institutions, and the graduates they produce, continue to emphasize the intellectual teachings of the Maharal. Rabbi Hutner in turn also maintained that Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808‚Äì1888) (19th-century Germany) must also have been influenced by the Maharal's ideas basing his seemingly rationalistic Weltanschauung on the more abstract and abstruse teachings of the hard-to-understand Jewish Kabbalah. Rabbi Judah Loew was not a champion of the open study of Kabbalah as such, and none of his works are in any way openly devoted to it. Instead, what they attempt to do is to make the ideas of the Kabbalah (which he held to be the most deeply true of all the Torah) accessible to the average educated reader, by presenting them in a rigorously philosophical form, couched in terms that are accessible to the public. According to R. Loew, only the greatest of Torah scholars are able to perceive the full intent of the Kabbalistic works in their complex entirety. Therefore, although kabbalistic doctrine permeates his writings, it is always presented in a rational and philosophic form. His main kabbalistic influences appear to have been the Zohar, Sefer Yetzirah, and traditions of the Chassidei Ashkenaz, as Lurianic Kabbalah had not by that time reached Europe. Faced with the Aristotelian interpretation of Talmudic Aggadot by Azariah dei Rossi, he was indignant at what he termed the trivialization of the Sages' deep wisdom. In his work Be'er ha-Golah he vigorously disputes all of dei Rossi's theses, sternly upholding the subtly allegorical nature of Aggadah and demonstrating its independence from (and superiority to) the superficial observations of natural science. At the same time he was entirely in favor of scientific research, so long as the researcher did not use his observations as permission to contradict the final authority of divine revelation. His constant thesis is that the Talmudic, Midrashic, and Aggadic teachings refer always to matters far beyond the competence of natural science. =Davidic line and descendants= According to Jewish tradition, the Maharal's family descended patrilineally from the Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the geonim) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty.See The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David, by Chaim Freedman, published in Avotaynu Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006 Among his many descendants were Schneur Zalman of Liadi, founder of Chabad Hasidism. Through this paternal line, Loew is the ancestor of many prominent later Jewish individuals, including Menachem Mendel Schneerson, seventh Rebbe of Lubavitch, and violinist Yehudi Menuhin. Maharal is also a (paternal) ancestor of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov (who was also a maternal great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidic Judaism), and an ancestor of aerodynamic theoretician Theodore von K√°rm√°n.

He is said to have used mystical powers based on the esoteric knowledge of how God created Adam. The general view of historians and critics is that the legend is a German literary invention of the early 19th century.

Germania, by Philipp Veit, 1836 Philipp Veit (13 February 179318 December 1877) was a German Romantic painter. It is to Veit that the credit of having been the first to revive the nearly forgotten technique of fresco painting is due. Biography Veit was born in Berlin, Prussia. He was the son of a banker Simon Veit and his wife Dorothea, daughter of Moses Mendelssohn, who subsequently left him to marry Friedrich Schlegel. Veit received his first art education in Dresden, where he was taught by Caspar David Friedrich, and Vienna. Although a prodigious talent when it came to drawing, Veit was not comfortable with oil painting, for which reason in Vienna he took to the medium of watercolour. In Vienna, he made the acquaintance of Schlegel, and through him came to know several Viennese Romantics, one of whom was the poet and novelist Joseph von Eichendorff. He was strongly influenced by, and joined, the Nazarene movement in Rome, where he worked for some years before moving to Frankfurt. Veit participated in the struggle against Napoleon in 1813‚Äì14, returning to Berlin for a short period. In 1815, he finished the Virgin with Christ and St John, a votive painting for the church of St James in Heiligenstadt, Vienna. The painting was inspired by the style of Pietro Perugino and Raphael. In Frankfurt, where his most important works are preserved at the St√§del, he was active from 1830 to 1843 as director of the art collections and as professor of painting. From 1853 till his death in 1877 he held the post of director of the municipal gallery in Mainz. Like his fellow Nazarenes he was more draughtsman than painter, and though his sense of colour was stronger than that of Overbeck or Cornelius, his works are generally more of the nature of coloured cartoons than of paintings in the modern sense. Veit's principal work is the large fresco of The Introduction of Christianity into Germany by St Boniface, at the St√§del.

Although he is best known for his religious works, Murillo also produced a considerable number of paintings of contemporary women and children. These lively, realist portraits of flower girls, street urchins, and beggars constitute an extensive and appealing record of the everyday life of his times. Childhood Murillo was born to Gaspar Esteban and Mar√≠a P√©rez. He may have been born in Seville or in Pilas, a smaller Andalusian town. It is clear that he was baptized in Seville in 1618, the youngest son in a family of fourteen. His father was a barber and surgeon. After his parents died in 1627 and 1628, he became a ward of his sister's husband, Juan Agust√≠n Lagares. Murillo seldom used his father's surname, and instead took his surname from his maternal grandmother, Elvira Murillo. Career The Holy Family with dog, c. 1645‚Äì1650, Museo del Prado Murillo began his art studies in Seville under Juan del Castillo, who was a relative of his mother (Murillo's uncle, Antonio P√©rez, was also a painter). His first works were influenced by Zurbar√°n, Jusepe de Ribera and Alonzo Cano, and he shared their strongly realist approach. The great commercial importance of Seville at the time ensured that he was subject to artistic influences from other regions. He became familiar with Flemish painting and the \\"Treatise on Sacred Images\\" of Molanus (Ian van der Meulen or Molano). As his painting developed, his more important works evolved towards the polished style that suited the bourgeois and aristocratic tastes of the time, demonstrated especially in his Roman Catholic religious works. In 1642, at the age of 26, he moved to Madrid, where he most likely became familiar with the work of Vel√°zquez, and would have seen the work of Venetian and Flemish masters in the royal collections; the rich colors and softly modeled forms of his subsequent work suggest these influences. In 1645 he returned to Seville and married Beatriz Cabrera y Villalobos, with whom he eventually had eleven children. Two women at a window, c.1655‚Äì1660, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. In that year, he painted eleven canvases for the convent of St. Francisco el Grande in Seville. These works depicting the miracles of Franciscan saints vary between the Zurbar√°nesque tenebrism of the Ecstasy of St Francis and a softly luminous style (as in Death of St Clare) that became typical of Murillo's mature work. According to the art historian Manuela B. Mena Marqu√©s, \\"in ... the Levitation of St Giles (usually known as the \\"Angel‚Äôs Kitchen\\", Paris, Louvre) and the Death of St Clare (Dresden, Gem√§ldegal. Alte Meister), the characteristic elements of Murillo‚Äôs work are already evident: the elegance and beauty of the female figures and the angels, the realism of the still-life details and the fusion of reality with the spiritual world, which is extraordinarily well developed in some of the compositions.\\" Also completed c. 1645 was the first of Murillo's many paintings of children, The Young Beggar (Mus√©e du Louvre), in which the influence of Vel√°zquez is apparent. Following the completion of a pair of pictures for the Seville Cathedral, he began to specialize in the themes that brought him his greatest successes: the Virgin and Child and the Immaculate Conception.The center medallion of the badge of the Spanish Order of Charles III is clearly modeled on Murillo's unique manner of representing the Immaculate Conception. The Adoration of the Shepherds, c.1650, Museo del Prado After another period in Madrid, from 1658 to 1660, he returned to Seville. Here he was one of the founders of the Academia de Bellas Artes (Academy of Art), sharing its direction, in 1660, with the architect Francisco Herrera the Younger. This was his period of greatest activity, and he received numerous important commissions, among them the altarpieces for the Augustinian monastery, the paintings for Santa Mar√≠a la BlancaSanta Mar√≠a la Blanca (completed in 1665), and others. He died in Seville in 1682, a few months after he fell from a scaffold while working on a fresco at the church of the Capuchines in C√°diz. Legacy Murillo had many pupils and followers. The prolific imitation of his paintings ensured his reputation in Spain and fame throughout Europe, and prior to the 19th century his work was more widely known than that of any other Spanish artist. Artists influenced by his style included Gainsborough and Greuze.Marqu√©s, Manuela B. Mena. \\"Murillo, Bartolom√© Esteban.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press.

S√∏ren Kierkegaard (a Danish philosopher) is frequently included in surveys of German (or Germanic) philosophy due to his extensive engagement with German thinkers.Lowith, Karl. From Hegel to Nietzsche, 1991, p. 370-375.Pinkard, Terry P. German philosophy, 1760-1860: the legacy of idealism, 2002, ch. 13.Stewart, Jon B. Kierkegaard and his German contemporaries, 2007Kenny, Anthony. Oxford Illustrated History of Western Philosophy, 2001, p.220-224. 17th century =Leibniz= Leibniz Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716) was both a philosopher and a mathematician who wrote primarily in Latin and French. Leibniz, along with Ren√© Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great 17th century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz also anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence. Leibniz is noted for his optimism - his Th√©odic√©eRutherford (1998) is a detailed scholarly study of Leibniz's theodicy. tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all possible worlds. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws. Leibniz is also known for his theory of monads, as exposited in Monadologie. Monads are to the metaphysical realm what atoms are to the physical/phenomenal. They can also be compared to the corpuscles of the Mechanical Philosophy of Ren√© Descartes and others. Monads are the ultimate elements of the universe. The monads are \\"substantial forms of being\\" with the following properties: they are eternal, indecomposable, individual, subject to their own laws, un-interacting, and each reflecting the entire universe in a pre-established harmony (a historically important example of panpsychism). Monads are centers of force; substance is force, while space, matter, and motion are merely phenomenal. 18th century =Wolff= Christian Wolff (1679‚Äì1754) was the most eminent German philosopher between Leibniz and Kant. His main achievement was a complete oeuvre on almost every scholarly subject of his time, displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive, mathematical method, which perhaps represents the peak of Enlightenment rationality in Germany. Wolff was one of the first to use German as a language of scholarly instruction and research, although he also wrote in Latin, so that an international audience could, and did, read him. A founding father of, among other fields, economics and public administration as academic disciplines, he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in government, and stressing the professional nature of university education. =Kant= Immanuel Kant In 1781, Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) published his Critique of Pure Reason, in which he attempted to determine what we can and cannot know through the use of reason independent of all experience. Briefly, he came to the conclusion that we could come to know an external world through experience, but that what we could know about it was limited by the limited terms in which the mind can think: if we can only comprehend things in terms of cause and effect, then we can only know causes and effects. It follows from this that we can know the form of all possible experience independent of all experience, but nothing else, but we can never know the world from the ‚Äústandpoint of nowhere‚Äù and therefore we can never know the world in its entirety, neither via reason nor experience. Since the publication of his Critique, Immanuel Kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy. In the late 18th and early 19th century, one direct line of influence from Kant is German Idealism. 19th century =German idealism= German idealism was a philosophical movement that emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It developed out of the work of Immanuel Kant in the 1780s and 1790s,Frederick C. Beiser, German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781-1801, Harvard University Press, 2002, part I. and was closely linked both with Romanticism and the revolutionary politics of the Enlightenment. The most prominent German idealists in the movement, besides Kant, were Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762‚Äì1814), Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775‚Äì1854) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770‚Äì1831) who was the predominant figure in nineteenth century German philosophy, and the proponents of Jena Romanticism; Friedrich H√∂lderlin (1770‚Äì1843), Novalis (1772‚Äì1801), and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772‚Äì1829).Frederick C. Beiser, German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781-1801, Harvard University Press, 2002, p. viii: \\"the young romantics‚ÄîH√∂lderlin, Schlegel, Novalis‚Äî[were] crucial figures in the development of German idealism.\\" August Ludwig H√ºlsen, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Gottlob Ernst Schulze, Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Salomon Maimon, Friedrich Schleiermacher, and Arthur Schopenhauer also made major contributions.

W. F. Hegel (1770-1831) =Karl Marx and the Young Hegelians= Hegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth century; by its end, according to Bertrand Russell, \\"the leading academic philosophers, both in America and Britain, were largely Hegelian\\".Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy. His influence has continued in contemporary philosophy but mainly in Continental philosophy. ;Right Hegelians Among those influenced by Hegel immediately after his death in 1831 two distinct groups can be roughly divided into the politically and religiously radical 'left', or 'young', Hegelians and the more conservative 'right', or 'old', Hegelians. The Right Hegelians followed the master in believing that the dialectic of history had come to an end‚ÄîHegel's Phenomenology of Spirit reveals itself to be the culmination of history as the reader reaches its end. Here he meant that reason and freedom had reached their maximums as they were embodied by the existing Prussian state. And here the master‚Äôs claim was viewed as paradox, at best; the Prussian regime indeed provided extensive civil and social services, good universities, high employment and some industrialization, but it was ranked as rather backward politically compared with the more liberal constitutional monarchies of France and Britain. Philosophers within the camp of the Hegelian right include: * Johann Philipp Gabler * Hermann Friedrich Wilhelm Hinrichs * Karl Daub * Heinrich Leo * Leopold von Henning * Heinrich Gustav Hotho Other thinkers or historians who may be included among the Hegelian right, with some reservations, include: * Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz * Eduard Gans * Karl Ludwig Michelet * Philip Marheineke * Wilhelm Vatke * Johann Eduard Erdmann * Eduard Zeller * Albert Schwegler Speculative theism was an 1830s movement closely related to but distinguished from Right Hegelianism.Frederick C. Beiser (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Hegel, Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 339 n. 58. Its proponents (Immanuel Hermann Fichte (1796‚Äì1879), Christian Hermann Weisse (1801‚Äì1866), and Hermann Ulrici (1806‚Äì1884)Kelly Parker, Krzysztof Skowronski (eds.), Josiah Royce for the Twenty-first Century: Historical, Ethical, and Religious Interpretations, Lexington Books, 2012, p. 202. were united in their demand to recover the \\"personal God\\" after panlogist Hegelianism.Warren Breckman, Marx, the Young Hegelians, and the Origins of Radical Social Theory: Dethroning the Self, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 49. The movement featured elements of anti-psychologism in the historiography of philosophy.William R. Woodward, Hermann Lotze: An Intellectual Biography, Cambridge University Press, 2015, pp. 74‚Äì5. ;Young Hegelians The Young Hegelians drew on Hegel's idea that the purpose and promise of history was the total negation of everything conducive to restricting freedom and reason; and they proceeded to mount radical critiques, first of religion and then of the Prussian political system. The Young Hegelians who were unpopular because of their radical views on religion and society. They felt Hegel's apparent belief in the end of history conflicted with other aspects of his thought and that, contrary to his later thought, the dialectic was certainly not complete; this they felt was (painfully) obvious given the irrationality of religious beliefs and the empirical lack of freedoms‚Äîespecially political and religious freedoms‚Äîin existing Prussian society. They rejected anti-utopian aspects of his thought that \\"Old Hegelians\\" have interpreted to mean that the world has already essentially reached perfection. They included Ludwig Feuerbach (1804‚Äì72), David Strauss (1808‚Äì74), Bruno Bauer (1809‚Äì82) and Max Stirner (1806‚Äì56) among their ranks. Karl Marx (1818‚Äì83) often attended their meetings. He developed an interest in Hegelianism, French socialism and British economic theory. He transformed the three into an essential work of economics called Das Kapital, which consisted of a critical economic examination of capitalism. Marxism became one of the major forces on twentieth century world history. It is important to note that the groups were not as unified or as self-conscious as the labels 'right' and 'left' make them appear. The term 'Right Hegelian', for example, was never actually used by those to whom it was later ascribed, namely, Hegel's direct successors at the Fredrick William University (now the Humboldt University of Berlin). (The term was first used by David Strauss to describe Bruno Bauer‚Äîwho actually was a typically 'Left', or Young, Hegelian.)

He was influenced by Eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism, and was known for his pessimism. Schopenhauer's most influential work, The World as Will and Representation (1818), claimed that the world is fundamentally what we recognize in ourselves as our will. His analysis of will led him to the conclusion that emotional, physical, and sexual desires can never be fulfilled. Consequently, he eloquently described a lifestyle of negating desires, similar to the ascetic teachings of Vedanta and the Desert Fathers of early Christianity.The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 2, Ch. 48 (Dover page 616), \\"The ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in genuine and original Christianity, as it was developed in the writings of the Church Fathers from the kernel of the New Testament; this tendency is the highest point to which everything strives upwards.\\" During the endtimes of Schopenhauer's life and subsequent years after his death, post-Schopenhauerian pessimism became a rather popular \\"trend\\" in 19th century Germany.Monika Langer, Nietzsche's Gay Science: Dancing Coherence, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 231. Nevertheless, it was viewed with disdain by the other popular philosophies at the time, such as Hegelianism, materialism, neo-Kantianism and the emerging positivism. In an age of upcoming revolutions and exciting new discoveries in science, the resigned and a-progressive nature of the typical pessimist was seen as detriment to social development. To respond to this growing criticism, a group of philosophers greatly influenced by Schopenhauer such as Julius Bahnsen (1830‚Äì81), Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann (1842‚Äì1906), Philipp Mainl√§nder (1841‚Äì76), and even some of his personal acquaintances developed their own brand of pessimism, each in their own unique way.Beiser reviews the commonly held position that Schopenhauer was a transcendental idealist and he rejects it: \\"Though it is deeply heretical from the standpoint of transcendental idealism, Schopenhauer's objective standpoint involves a form of transcendental realism, i.e. the assumption of the independent reality of the world of experience.\\" (Beiser, Frederick C., Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860‚Äì1900, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 40).Beiser, Frederick C., Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860‚Äì1900, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 213 n. 30. Working in the metaphysical framework of Schopenhauer, Philipp Mainl√§nder sees the \\"will\\" as the innermost core of being, the ontological arche. However, he deviates from Schopenhauer in important respects. With Schopenhauer the will is singular, unified and beyond time and space. Schopenhauer's transcendental idealism leads him to conclude that we only have access to a certain aspect of the thing-in-itself by introspective observation of our own bodies. What we observe as will is all there is to observe, nothing more. There are no hidden aspects. Furthermore, via introspection we can only observe our individual will. This also leads Mainl√§nder to the philosophical position of pluralism. Additionally, Mainl√§nder accentuates on the idea of salvation for all of creation. This is yet another respect in which he differentiates his philosophy from that of Schopenhauer. With Schopenhauer, the silencing of the will is a rare event. The artistic genius can achieve this state temporarily, while only a few saints have achieved total cessation throughout history. For Mainl√§nder, the entirety of the cosmos is slowly but surely moving towards the silencing of the will-to-live and to (as he calls it) \\"redemption\\". =Neo- Kantianism= Neo-Kantianism refers broadly to a revived type of philosophy along the lines of that laid down by Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, or more specifically by Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy in his work The World as Will and Representation, as well as by other post-Kantian philosophers such as Jakob Friedrich Fries (1773‚Äì1843) and Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776‚Äì1841). The neo-Kantian schools tended to emphasize scientific readings of Kant, often downplaying the role of intuition in favour of concepts. However, the ethical aspects of neo-Kantian thought often drew them within the orbit of socialism, and they had an important influence on Austromarxism and the revisionism of Eduard Bernstein. The neo-Kantian school was of importance in devising a division of philosophy that has had durable influence well beyond Germany. It made early use of terms such as epistemology and upheld its prominence over ontology. By 1933 (after the rise of Nazism), the various neo-Kantian circles in Germany had dispersed.Luft 2015, p. xxvi. Notable neo-Kantian philosophers include; *Eduard Zeller (1814‚Äì1908) *Charles Bernard Renouvier (1815‚Äì1903) *Hermann LotzeHermann Lotze: Thought: logic and language, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1817‚Äì1881) *Hermann von Helmholtz (1821‚Äì1894) *Kuno Fischer (1824‚Äì1907) *Friedrich Albert Lange (1828‚Äì1875) *Wilhelm Dilthey (1833‚Äì1911) *African Spir (1837‚Äì1890) *Otto Liebmann (1840‚Äì1912) *Hermann Cohen (1842‚Äì1918) *Alois Riehl (1844‚Äì1924) *Wilhelm Windelband (1848‚Äì1915) *Johannes Volkelt (1848‚Äì1930) *Benno Erdmann (1851‚Äì1921) *Hans Vaihinger (1852‚Äì1933) *Paul Natorp (1854‚Äì1924) *√âmile Meyerson (1859‚Äì1933) *Karl Vorl√§nder (1860‚Äì1928) *Heinrich Rickert (1863‚Äì1936) *Ernst Troeltsch (1865‚Äì1923) *Ernst Cassirer (1874‚Äì1945) *Emil Lask (1875‚Äì1915) *Richard Honigswald (1875‚Äì1947) *Bruno Bauch (1877‚Äì1942) *Leonard Nelson (1882‚Äì1927) *Nicolai Hartmann (1882‚Äì1950) *Hans Kelsen (1881‚Äì1973) =Nietzsche= Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900) was initially a proponent of Schopenhauer. However, he soon came to disavow Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook on life and sought to provide a positive philosophy. He believed this task to be urgent, as he believed a form of nihilism caused by modernity was spreading across Europe, which he summed up in the phrase \\"God is dead\\". His problem, then, was how to live a positive life considering that if you believe in God, you give in to dishonesty and cruel beliefs (e.g. divine predestination of some individuals to Hell), and if you don't believe in God, you give in to nihilism. He believed he found his solution in the concepts of the √úbermensch and Eternal Recurrence. His work continues to have a major influence on both philosophers and artists. 20th century =Analytic philosophy= Frege, Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle In the late 19th century, the predicate logic of Gottlob Frege (1848‚Äì1925) overthrew Aristotelian logic (the dominant logic since its inception in Ancient Greece). This was the beginning of analytic philosophy. In the early part of the 20th century, a group of German and Austrian philosophers and scientists formed the Vienna Circle to promote scientific thought over Hegelian system-building, which they saw as a bad influence on intellectual thought. The group considered themselves logical positivists because they believed all knowledge is either derived through experience or arrived at through analytic statements, and they adopted the predicate logic of Frege, as well as the early work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889‚Äì1951) as foundations to their work. Wittgenstein did not agree with their interpretation of his philosophy. =Continental philosophy= While some of the seminal philosophers of twentieth-century analytical philosophy were German-speakers, most German-language philosophy of the twentieth century tends to be defined not as analytical but 'continental' philosophy ‚Äì as befits Germany's position as part of the European 'continent' as opposed to the British Isles or other culturally European nations outside of Europe. File:Edmund Husserl 1900.jpgEdmund Husserl (1859‚Äì1938) File:Karl Jaspers 1910.jpgKarl Jaspers (1883‚Äì1969) File:Heidegger 2 (1960).jpgMartin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976) File:Hannah Arendt 1933.jpgHannah Arendt (1906‚Äì1975) Phenomenology Phenomenology began at the start of the 20th century with the descriptive psychology of Franz Brentano (1838‚Äì1917), and then the transcendental phenomenology of Edmund Husserl (1859‚Äì1938). Max Scheler (1874‚Äì1928) further developed the philosophical method of phenomenology. It was then transformed by Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976), whose famous book Being and Time (1927) applied phenomenology to ontology, and who, along with Ludwig Wittgenstein, is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Phenomenology has had a large influence on Continental Philosophy, particularly existentialism and poststructuralism. Heidegger himself is often identified as an existentialist, though he would have rejected this. Hermeneutics Hermeneutics is the philosophical theory and practice of interpretation and understanding. Originally hermeneutics referred to the interpretation of texts, especially religious texts. In the 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768‚Äì1834), Wilhelm Dilthey (1833‚Äì1911) and others expanded the discipline of hermeneutics beyond mere exegesis and turned it into a general humanistic discipline. Schleiermacher wondered whether there could be a hermeneutics that was not a collection of pieces of ad hoc advice for the solution of specific problems with text interpretation but rather a \\"general hermeneutics,\\" which dealt with the \\"art of understanding\\" as such, which pertained to the structure and function of understanding wherever it occurs. Later in the 19th century, Dilthey began to see possibilities for continuing Schleiermacher's general hermeneutics project as a \\"general methodology of the humanities and social sciences\\". In the 20th century, hermeneutics took an 'ontological turn'. Martin Heidegger's Being and Time fundamentally transformed the discipline. No longer was it conceived of as being about understanding linguistic communication, or providing a methodological basis for the human sciences - as far as Heidegger was concerned, hermeneutics is ontology, dealing with the most fundamental conditions of man's being in the world. The Heideggerian conception of hermeneutics was further developed by Heidegger's pupil Hans- Georg Gadamer (1900‚Äì2002), in his book Truth and Method. Frankfurt School J√ºrgen Habermas In 1923, Carl Gr√ºnberg founded the Institute for Social Research, drawing from Marxism, Freud's psychoanalysis and Weberian philosophy, which came to be known as the \\"Frankfurt School\\". Expelled by the Nazis, the school reformed again in Frankfurt after World War II. Although they drew from Marxism, they were outspoken opponents of Stalinism. Books from the group, like Adorno‚Äôs and Horkheimer‚Äôs Dialectic of Enlightenment and Adorno‚Äôs Negative Dialectics, critiqued what they saw as the failure of the Enlightenment project and the problems of modernity. Postmodernists consider the Frankfurt school to be one of their precursors. Since the 1960s the Frankfurt School has been guided by J√ºrgen Habermas' (born 1929) work on communicative reason,Habermas, J√ºrgen. (1987). The Theory of Communicative Action.

The field of molecular evolution uses principles of evolutionary biology and population genetics to explain patterns in these changes. Major topics in molecular evolution concern the rates and impacts of single nucleotide changes, neutral evolution vs. natural selection, origins of new genes, the genetic nature of complex traits, the genetic basis of speciation, evolution of development, and ways that evolutionary forces influence genomic and phenotypic changes. History The history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry, and the use of \\"fingerprinting\\" methods such as immune assays, gel electrophoresis and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins. The field of molecular evolution came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s, following the rise of molecular biology. The advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison, and to use the differences between homologous sequences as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the last universal common ancestor. In the late 1960s, the neutral theory of molecular evolution provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock, though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial, since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to panselectionism, with natural selection as the only important cause of evolutionary change. After the 1970s, nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal RNA sequences, the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life. Forces in molecular evolution The content and structure of a genome is the product of the molecular and population genetic forces which act upon that genome. Novel genetic variants will arise through mutation and will spread and be maintained in populations due to genetic drift or natural selection. =Mutation= This hedgehog has no pigmentation due to a mutation. Mutations are permanent, transmissible changes to the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of a cell or virus. Mutations result from errors in DNA replication during cell division and by exposure to radiation, chemicals, and other environmental stressors, or viruses and transposable elements. Most mutations that occur are single nucleotide polymorphisms which modify single bases of the DNA sequence, resulting in point mutations. Other types of mutations modify larger segments of DNA and can cause duplications, insertions, deletions, inversions, and translocations. Most organisms display a strong bias in the types of mutations that occur with strong influence in GC-content. Transitions (A ‚Üî G or C ‚Üî T) are more common than transversions (purine (adenine or guanine)) ‚Üî pyrimidine (cytosine or thymine, or in RNA, uracil)) and are less likely to alter amino acid sequences of proteins. Mutations are stochastic and typically occur randomly across genes. Mutation rates for single nucleotide sites for most organisms are very low, roughly 10‚àí9 to 10‚àí8 per site per generation, though some viruses have higher mutation rates on the order of 10‚àí6 per site per generation. Among these mutations, some will be neutral or beneficial and will remain in the genome unless lost via genetic drift, and others will be detrimental and will be eliminated from the genome by natural selection. Because mutations are extremely rare, they accumulate very slowly across generations. While the number of mutations which appears in any single generation may vary, over very long time periods they will appear to accumulate at a regular pace. Using the mutation rate per generation and the number of nucleotide differences between two sequences, divergence times can be estimated effectively via the molecular clock. =Recombination= Recombination involves the breakage and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two re-arranged chromosomes (C1 and C2). Recombination is a process that results in genetic exchange between chromosomes or chromosomal regions. Recombination counteracts physical linkage between adjacent genes, thereby reducing genetic hitchhiking. The resulting independent inheritance of genes results in more efficient selection, meaning that regions with higher recombination will harbor fewer detrimental mutations, more selectively favored variants, and fewer errors in replication and repair. Recombination can also generate particular types of mutations if chromosomes are misaligned. Gene conversion Gene conversion is a type of recombination that is the product of DNA repair where nucleotide damage is corrected using an homologous genomic region as a template. Damaged bases are first excised, the damaged strand is then aligned with an undamaged homolog, and DNA synthesis repairs the excised region using the undamaged strand as a guide. Gene conversion is often responsible for homogenizing sequences of duplicate genes over long time periods, reducing nucleotide divergence. =Genetic drift= Genetic drift is the change of allele frequencies from one generation to the next due to stochastic effects of random sampling in finite populations. Some existing variants have no effect on fitness and may increase or decrease in frequency simply due to chance. \\"Nearly neutral\\" variants whose selection coefficient is close to a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size will also be affected by chance as well as by selection and mutation. Many genomic features have been ascribed to accumulation of nearly neutral detrimental mutations as a result of small effective population sizes. With a smaller effective population size, a larger variety of mutations will behave as if they are neutral due to inefficiency of selection. =Selection= Selection occurs when organisms with greater fitness, i.e. greater ability to survive or reproduce, are favored in subsequent generations, thereby increasing the instance of underlying genetic variants in a population. Selection can be the product of natural selection, artificial selection, or sexual selection. Natural selection is any selective process that occurs due to the fitness of an organism to its environment. In contrast sexual selection is a product of mate choice and can favor the spread of genetic variants which act counter to natural selection but increase desirability to the opposite sex or increase mating success. Artificial selection, also known as selective breeding, is imposed by an outside entity, typically humans, in order to increase the frequency of desired traits. The principles of population genetics apply similarly to all types of selection, though in fact each may produce distinct effects due to clustering of genes with different functions in different parts of the genome, or due to different properties of genes in particular functional classes. For instance, sexual selection could be more likely to affect molecular evolution of the sex chromosomes due to clustering of sex specific genes on the X, Y, Z or W. =Intragenomic conflict= Selection can operate at the gene level at the expense of organismal fitness, resulting in intragenomic conflict. This is because there can be a selective advantage for selfish genetic elements in spite of a host cost. Examples of such selfish elements include transposable elements, meiotic drivers, killer X chromosomes, selfish mitochondria, and self-propagating introns. Genome architecture =Genome size= Genome size is influenced by the amount of repetitive DNA as well as number of genes in an organism. The C-value paradox refers to the lack of correlation between organism 'complexity' and genome size. Explanations for the so-called paradox are two-fold. First, repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms, thereby inflating DNA content of the haploid genome. Secondly, the number of genes is not necessarily indicative of the number of developmental stages or tissue types in an organism. An organism with few developmental stages or tissue types may have large numbers of genes that influence non-developmental phenotypes, inflating gene content relative to developmental gene families. Neutral explanations for genome size suggest that when population sizes are small, many mutations become nearly neutral. Hence, in small populations repetitive content and other 'junk' DNA can accumulate without placing the organism at a competitive disadvantage. There is little evidence to suggest that genome size is under strong widespread selection in multicellular eukaryotes. Genome size, independent of gene content, correlates poorly with most physiological traits and many eukaryotes, including mammals, harbor very large amounts of repetitive DNA. However, birds likely have experienced strong selection for reduced genome size, in response to changing energetic needs for flight. Birds, unlike humans, produce nucleated red blood cells, and larger nuclei lead to lower levels of oxygen transport. Bird metabolism is far higher than that of mammals, due largely to flight, and oxygen needs are high. Hence, most birds have small, compact genomes with few repetitive elements. Indirect evidence suggests that non-avian theropod dinosaur ancestors of modern birds also had reduced genome sizes, consistent with endothermy and high energetic needs for running speed. Many bacteria have also experienced selection for small genome size, as time of replication and energy consumption are so tightly correlated with fitness. =Repetitive elements= Transposable elements are self-replicating, selfish genetic elements which are capable of proliferating within host genomes. Many transposable elements are related to viruses, and share several proteins in common. =Chromosome number and organization= The number of chromosomes in an organism's genome also does not necessarily correlate with the amount of DNA in its genome. The ant Myrmecia pilosula has only a single pair of chromosomes whereas the Adders- tongue fern Ophioglossum reticulatum has up to 1260 chromosomes. Cilliate genomes house each gene in individual chromosomes, resulting in a genome which is not physically linked. Reduced linkage through creation of additional chromosomes should effectively increase the efficiency of selection. Changes in chromosome number can play a key role in speciation, as differing chromosome numbers can serve as a barrier to reproduction in hybrids. Human chromosome 2 was created from a fusion of two chimpanzee chromosomes and still contains central telomeres as well as a vestigial second centromere. Polyploidy, especially allopolyploidy, which occurs often in plants, can also result in reproductive incompatibilities with parental species. Agrodiatus blue butterflies have diverse chromosome numbers ranging from n=10 to n=134 and additionally have one of the highest rates of speciation identified to date. =Gene content and distribution= Different organisms house different numbers of genes within their genomes as well as different patterns in the distribution of genes throughout the genome. Some organisms, such as most bacteria, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis have particularly compact genomes with little repetitive content or non-coding DNA. Other organisms, like mammals or maize, have large amounts of repetitive DNA, long introns, and substantial spacing between different genes. The content and distribution of genes within the genome can influence the rate at which certain types of mutations occur and can influence the subsequent evolution of different species. Genes with longer introns are more likely to recombine due to increased physical distance over the coding sequence. As such, long introns may facilitate ectopic recombination, and result in higher rates of new gene formation. =Organelles= In addition to the nuclear genome, endosymbiont organelles contain their own genetic material typically as circular plasmids. Mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA varies across taxa, but membrane-bound proteins, especially electron transport chain constituents are most often encoded in the organelle. Chloroplasts and mitochondria are maternally inherited in most species, as the organelles must pass through the egg. In a rare departure, some species of mussels are known to inherit mitochondria from father to son. Origins of new genes New genes arise from several different genetic mechanisms including gene duplication, de novo origination, retrotransposition, chimeric gene formation, recruitment of non-coding sequence, and gene truncation. Gene duplication initially leads to redundancy. However, duplicated gene sequences can mutate to develop new functions or specialize so that the new gene performs a subset of the original ancestral functions. In addition to duplicating whole genes, sometimes only a domain or part of a protein is duplicated so that the resulting gene is an elongated version of the parental gene. Retrotransposition creates new genes by copying mRNA to DNA and inserting it into the genome. Retrogenes often insert into new genomic locations, and often develop new expression patterns and functions. Chimeric genes form when duplication, deletion, or incomplete retrotransposition combine portions of two different coding sequences to produce a novel gene sequence. Chimeras often cause regulatory changes and can shuffle protein domains to produce novel adaptive functions. De novo gene birth can also give rise to new genes from previously non-coding DNA. For instance, Levine and colleagues reported the origin of five new genes in the D. melanogaster genome from noncoding DNA. Similar de novo origin of genes has been also shown in other organisms such as yeast, rice and humans. De novo genes may evolve from transcripts that are already expressed at low levels. Mutation of a stop codon to a regular codon or a frameshift may cause an extended protein that includes a previously non-coding sequence. The formation of novel genes from scratch typically can not occur within genomic regions of high gene density. The essential events for de novo formation of genes is recombination/mutation which includes insertions, deletions, and inversions. These events are tolerated if the consequence of these genetic events does not interfere in cellular activities. Most genomes comprise prophages wherein genetic modifications do not, in general, affect the host genome propagation. Hence, there is higher probability of genetic modifications, in regions such as prophages, which is proportional to the probability of de novo formation of genes. De novo evolution of genes can also be simulated in the laboratory. For example, semi-random gene sequences can be selected for specific functions. More specifically, they selected sequences from a library that could complement a gene deletion in E. coli. The deleted gene encodes ferric enterobactin esterase (Fes), which releases iron from an iron chelator, enterobactin. While Fes is a 400 amino acid protein, the newly selected gene was only 100 amino acids in length and unrelated in sequence to Fes. In vitro molecular evolution experiments Principles of molecular evolution have also been discovered, and others elucidated and tested using experimentation involving amplification, variation and selection of rapidly proliferating and genetically varying molecular species outside cells. Since the pioneering work of Sol Spiegelmann in 1967 [ref], involving RNA that replicates itself with the aid of an enzyme extracted from the Q√ü virus [ref], several groups (such as Kramers [ref] and Biebricher/Luce/Eigen [ref]) studied mini and micro variants of this RNA in the 1970s and 1980s that replicate on the timescale of seconds to a minute, allowing hundreds of generations with large population sizes (e.g. 10^14 sequences) to be followed in a single day of experimentation. The chemical kinetic elucidation of the detailed mechanism of replication [ref, ref] meant that this type of system was the first molecular evolution system that could be fully characterised on the basis of physical chemical kinetics, later allowing the first models of the genotype to phenotype map based on sequence dependent RNA folding and refolding to be produced [ref, ref]. Subject to maintaining the function of the multicomponent Q√ü enzyme, chemical conditions could be varied significantly, in order to study the influence of changing environments and selection pressures [ref]. Experiments with in vitro RNA quasi species included the characterisation of the error threshold for information in molecular evolution [ref], the discovery of de novo evolution [ref] leading to diverse replicating RNA species and the discovery of spatial travelling waves as ideal molecular evolution reactors [ref, ref]. Later experiments employed novel combinations of enzymes to elucidate novel aspects of interacting molecular evolution involving population dependent fitness, including work with artificially designed molecular predator prey and cooperative systems of multiple RNA and DNA [ref, ref]. Special evolution reactors were designed for these studies, starting with serial transfer machines, flow reactors such as cell-stat machines, capillary reactors, and microreactors including line flow reactors and gel slice reactors. These studies were accompanied by theoretical developments and simulations involving RNA folding and replication kinetics that elucidated the importance of the correlation structure between distance in sequence space and fitness changes [ref], including the role of neutral networks and structural ensembles in evolutionary optimisation. Molecular phylogenetics Molecular systematics is the product of the traditional fields of systematics and molecular genetics. It uses DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to resolve questions in systematics, i.e. about their correct scientific classification or taxonomy from the point of view of evolutionary biology. Molecular systematics has been made possible by the availability of techniques for DNA sequencing, which allow the determination of the exact sequence of nucleotides or bases in either DNA or RNA. At present it is still a long and expensive process to sequence the entire genome of an organism, and this has been done for only a few species. However, it is quite feasible to determine the sequence of a defined area of a particular chromosome. Typical molecular systematic analyses require the sequencing of around 1000 base pairs. The driving forces of evolution Depending on the relative importance assigned to the various forces of evolution, three perspectives provide evolutionary explanations for molecular evolution. Selectionist hypotheses argue that selection is the driving force of molecular evolution. While acknowledging that many mutations are neutral, selectionists attribute changes in the frequencies of neutral alleles to linkage disequilibrium with other loci that are under selection, rather than to random genetic drift. Biases in codon usage are usually explained with reference to the ability of even weak selection to shape molecular evolution. Neutralist hypotheses emphasize the importance of mutation, purifying selection, and random genetic drift. The introduction of the neutral theory by Kimura, quickly followed by King and Jukes' own findings, led to a fierce debate about the relevance of neodarwinism at the molecular level. The Neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most mutations in DNA are at locations not important to function or fitness. These neutral changes drift towards fixation within a population. Positive changes will be very rare, and so will not greatly contribute to DNA polymorphisms. Deleterious mutations do not contribute much to DNA diversity because they negatively affect fitness and so are removed from the gene pool before long. This theory provides a framework for the molecular clock. The fate of neutral mutations are governed by genetic drift, and contribute to both nucleotide polymorphism and fixed differences between species.The nearly neutral theory expanded the neutralist perspective, suggesting that several mutations are nearly neutral, which means both random drift and natural selection is relevant to their dynamics. In the strictest sense, the neutral theory is not accurate. Subtle changes in DNA very often have effects, but sometimes these effects are too small for natural selection to act on. Even synonymous mutations are not necessarily neutral because there is not a uniform amount of each codon. The nearly neutral theory expanded the neutralist perspective, suggesting that several mutations are nearly neutral, which means both random drift and natural selection is relevant to their dynamics. The main difference between the neutral theory and nearly neutral theory is that the latter focuses on weak selection, not strictly neutral. Mutationists hypotheses emphasize random drift and biases in mutation patterns. Sueoka was the first to propose a modern mutationist view. He proposed that the variation in GC content was not the result of positive selection, but a consequence of the GC mutational pressure. Protein evolution This chart compares the sequence identity of different lipase proteins throughout the human body. It demonstrates how proteins evolve, keeping some regions conserved while others change dramatically. Evolution of proteins is studied by comparing the sequences and structures of proteins from many organisms representing distinct evolutionary clades. If the sequences/structures of two proteins are similar indicating that the proteins diverged from a common origin, these proteins are called as homologous proteins. More specifically, homologous proteins that exist in two distinct species are called orthologs. Whereas, homologous proteins encoded by the genome of a single species are called paralogs. The phylogenetic relationships of proteins are examined by multiple sequence comparisons. Phylogenetic trees of proteins can be established by the comparison of sequence identities among proteins. Such phylogenetic trees have established that the sequence similarities among proteins reflect closely the evolutionary relationships among organisms. Protein evolution describes the changes over time in protein shape, function, and composition. Through quantitative analysis and experimentation, scientists have strived to understand the rate and causes of protein evolution. Using the amino acid sequences of hemoglobin and cytochrome c from multiple species, scientists were able to derive estimations of protein evolution rates. What they found was that the rates were not the same among proteins. Each protein has its own rate, and that rate is constant across phylogenies (i.e., hemoglobin does not evolve at the same rate as cytochrome c, but hemoglobins from humans, mice, etc. do have comparable rates of evolution.). Not all regions within a protein mutate at the same rate; functionally important areas mutate more slowly and amino acid substitutions involving similar amino acids occurs more often than dissimilar substitutions. Overall, the level of polymorphisms in proteins seems to be fairly constant. Several species (including humans, fruit flies, and mice) have similar levels of protein polymorphism. In his Dublin 1943 lectures, ‚ÄúWhat Is Life?‚Äù, Erwin Schrodinger proposed that we could progress in answering this question by using statistical mechanics and partition functions, but not quantum mechanics and his wave equation. He described an ‚Äúaperiodic crystal‚Äù which could carry genetic information, a description credited by Francis Crick and James D. Watson with having inspired their discovery of the double helical structure of DNA . Twenty fractals were discovered in solvent associated surface areas of > 5000 protein segments . The existence of these fractals proves that proteins function near critical points of second-order phase transitions, realizing Schrodinger's conjecture. It opens a new biophysics field of accurate thermodynamic analysis of protein evolution based primarily on amino acid sequences =Relation to nucleic acid evolution= Protein evolution is inescapably tied to changes and selection of DNA polymorphisms and mutations because protein sequences change in response to alterations in the DNA sequence. Amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences do not mutate at the same rate. Due to the degenerate nature of DNA, bases can change without affecting the amino acid sequence. For example, there are six codons that code for leucine. Thus, despite the difference in mutation rates, it is essential to incorporate nucleic acid evolution into the discussion of protein evolution. At the end of the 1960s, two groups of scientists‚ÄîKimura (1968) and King and Jukes (1969)‚Äîindependently proposed that a majority of the evolutionary changes observed in proteins were neutral. Since then, the neutral theory has been expanded upon and debated. Discordance with morphological evolution There are sometimes discordances between molecular and morphological evolution, which are reflected in molecular and morphological systematic studies, especially of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotic microbes. These discordances can be categorized as two types: (i) one morphology, multiple lineages (e.g. morphological convergence, cryptic species) and (ii) one lineage, multiple morphologies (e.g. phenotypic plasticity, multiple life-cycle stages). Neutral evolution possibly could explain the incongruences in some cases.

Compared to English Romanticism, the German variety developed relatively early, and, in the opening years, coincided with Weimar Classicism (1772‚Äì1805). In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety of Romanticism notably valued wit, humour, and beauty. The early period, roughly 1797 to 1802, is referred to as Fr√ºhromantik or Jena Romanticism.Beiser, ix The philosophers and writers central to the movement were Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder (1773‚Äì1798), Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775‚Äì1854), Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768‚Äì1834), Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772‚Äì1829), August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767‚Äì1845), Ludwig Tieck (1773‚Äì1853), and Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis) (1772‚Äì1801).Beiser, 7 The early German romantics strove to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, by viewing the Middle Ages as a simpler period of integrated culture; however, the German romantics became aware of the tenuousness of the cultural unity they sought. Late-stage German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the daily world and the irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius. In particular, the critic Heinrich Heine criticized the tendency of the early German romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society. Literary and philosophical figures Angelica Kauffman, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 1787 Moritz Daniel Oppenheim Heinrich Heine, 1831, Kunsthalle Hamburg Joseph von Eichendorff Key figures of German romanticism include: * Johann Gottfried Herder * Heinrich Heine * Achim von Arnim * Bettina von Arnim * Clemens Brentano * Jean Paul * Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel * E.

In his earlier works, Beethoven was a Classicist in the traditions of Mozart and Haydn (his tutor), but his Middle Period, beginning with his third symphony (the 'Eroica'), bridges the worlds of Classical and Romantic music. Because Beethoven wrote some of his greatest music after he became totally deaf, he embodies the Romantic ideal of the tragic artist who defies all odds to conquer his own fate. His later works portray the triumph of the human spirit, most notably his 'Choral' Symphony No. 9; the stirring 'Ode to Joy' from this symphony has been adopted as the anthem of the European Union. * Johannes Brahms. His works are cast in the formal moulds of Classicism; he had a profound reverence for Beethoven. Brahms was also attracted to the exoticism of Hungarian folk music, and used it in such pieces as his famous Hungarian Dances, the final movement of his Violin Concerto, and the 'Rondo alla zingarese' from his Piano Quartet No. 1, op. 25, in G minor. * Franz Liszt. Liszt was by nationality a Hungarian, but nevertheless he spent many years in Germany, and his first language was German. Credited as the inventor of the tone poem. In his old age, Liszt adopted a more dissonant, ominous flavour, characteristic works being 'la Lugubre Gondola' and 'Die Zelle in Nonnenwerth'‚Äîpredating Impressionism and 20th-century atonality. * Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. A composer of the Early Romantic period, together with such figures as Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. One of the persons responsible for reviving interest in the almost-forgotten music of Johann Sebastian Bach. * Franz Schubert. His body of work consists mainly of song cycles and German Lieder set to poems by his contemporaries, many of which are among the most common repertoire in those categories performed today. * Robert Schumann. His works recall the nostalgia of lost childhood innocence, first love, and the magnificence of the German countryside. As an influential critic, he played a major role in discovering new talents, among them Chopin and Brahms. * Richard Wagner. The most famous composer of German opera; was an exponent of Leitmotif. One of the main figures in the so-called War of the Romantics. * Carl Maria von Weber. Perhaps the very first of Romantic musicians, if we exclude Beethoven, in the sense that Weber was the first major composer to emerge wholly as a product of the Romantic school, as contrasted with Beethoven, who had started off as a Classicist. The emotional intensity and supernatural, folklore-based themes in his operas presented a radical break from the Neoclassical traditions of that time.

He is generally best remembered for his command of a disastrous expedition against the French- occupied Ohio River Valley in 1755, in which he lost his life. (Both Virginia and Pennsylvania claimed this territory by their Royal grants.) Early career The son of Major-General Edward Braddock of the Coldstream Guards and his wife, Braddock followed his father into the army. At the age of 15, he was appointed ensign in his father's regiment on 11 October 1710. He was promoted to lieutenant of the grenadier company in 1716. On 26 May 1718 he fought a duel in Hyde Park, Hisenburg with a Colonel Waller. Braddock was promoted to captain in 1736, at the age of 41. He made major in 1743, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the regiment on 21 November 1745. He participated in the Siege of Bergen op Zoom in 1747. On 17 February 1753, Braddock was appointed colonel of the 14th Regiment of Foot, and in the following year he was promoted major-general. North America Appointed shortly afterward to command against the French in America, Braddock landed with two regiments of British regulars on 20 February 1755 in Hampton, in the colony of Virginia. He met with several of the colonial governors at the Congress of Alexandria on 14 April and was persuaded to undertake vigorous actions against the French. A general from Massachusetts would attack at Fort Niagara, General Johnson at Fort Saint-Fr√©d√©ric at Crown Point, Colonel Monckton at Fort Beausejour on the Bay of Fundy. He would lead an expedition against Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh) at the Forks of the Ohio River. After some months of preparation, in which he was hampered by administrative confusion and want of resources previously promised by the colonials, the Braddock expedition took the field with a picked column, in which George Washington served as a volunteer officer. Braddock took some of his men and marched forward, leaving most of his men behind. The column crossed the Monongahela River on 9 July 1755, and shortly afterward collided head-on with an Indian and French force which was rushing from Fort Duquesne to oppose the river crossing. Although the initial exchange of musketry favored the British, felling the French commander and causing some Canadian militia to flee, the remaining Indian/French force reacted quickly. They ran down the flanks of the column and put it under a murderous crossfire. Braddock's troops reacted poorly and became disordered. The British attempted retreat, but ran into the rest of the British soldiers earlier left behind. Braddock rallied his men repeatedly, but fell at last, mortally wounded by a shot through the chest. Although the exact causes of the defeat are debated to this day, a contributing factor was likely Braddock's underestimation of how effectively the French and Indians could react in a battle situation, and how rapidly the discipline and fighting effectiveness of his own men could evaporate. An article published in The Roanoke Times on April 15, 1951 claims that Braddock was shot dead by an American soldier called Benjamin Bolling. According to the article, Bolling intentionally shot Braddock to protect the lives of his fellow American soldiers during the ambush, as British troops were firing at American troops under the mistaken impression that they were actually French troops due to the fact that many Americans had taken cover in the tree line. The death of Braddock then allowed for Washington to take command and order a retreat, which, according to the article, allowed for the Americans to fall back without being further fired upon by the confused British, saving many of their lives. Braddock was borne off the field by Washington and Col. Nicholas Meriwether,; he died on 13 July from wounds suffered in the battle. Before he died, Braddock left Washington his ceremonial sash that he wore with his battle uniform. Some of his last words were, \\"Who would have thought?\\" Reportedly, Washington always took this sash with him for the rest of his life, both as the commander of the Continental Army or for his presidential duties. It is still on display today at Washington's home on the Potomac River, Mount Vernon. 19th-century engraving of General Braddock's burial near Great Meadows, Pennsylvania Braddock was buried just west of Great Meadows, where the remnants of the column halted on its retreat to reorganize. He was buried in the middle of the road that his men had just cut through and wagons were rolled over top of the grave site to prevent his body from being discovered and desecrated by the Indians. George Washington presided at the burial service, as the chaplain had been severely wounded. Legacy The grave of General Edward Braddock Dedication Plaque Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography (1791) includes an account of helping General Braddock garner supplies and carriages for the general's troops. He also describes a conversation with Braddock in which he explicitly warned the General that his plan to march troops to the fort through a narrow valley would be dangerous because of the possibility of an ambush. This is sometimes cited as advice against the disastrous eventual outcome, but the fact remains that Braddock was not ambushed in that final action, and the battle site was not, in any case, a narrow valley. Braddock had in fact taken great precautions against ambuscade, and had crossed the Monongahela an additional time to avoid the narrow Turtle Creek defile. In 1804, human remains believed to be Braddock's were found buried in the roadway about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) west of Great Meadows by a crew of road workers. The remains were exhumed. A marble monument was erected over the new grave site in 1913 by the Coldstream Guards. General Braddock is the namesake of Braddock Borough, Mt. Braddock, Braddock Hills, and North Braddock in Pennsylvania; the community of Braddock Heights or Braddock Mountain west of Frederick, Maryland; Braddock Middle School and Braddock Road in Cumberland, Maryland; and, in Virginia, Braddock Road, which runs from Alexandria to Aldie, a separate Braddock Road within the city of Alexandria - namesake of the Metrorail station at its eastern terminus - and Braddock Street in Winchester. Plus sections of the road cut by the British Army is known as \\"Braddock's Road\\" and forms most of eastern U.S. Route 40 in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

Her novels have been translated into 29 foreign languages, and she has appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List 19 times. In July 2018, it was announced that her Bridgerton series of books would be adapted for Netflix by Shonda Rhimes. Biography Julie Pottinger was raised primarily in New England, although she spent much of her time in California after her parents divorced. Even as a small child she devoured books. Her father disagreed with her choices of reading material, Sweet Dreams and the Sweet Valley High books, and told her she could keep reading them only if she could prove that they were good for her. She promptly told him that she was studying them in order to write one herself. Challenged to prove that she meant her statement, Pottinger sat down at their early computer and wrote her first two chapters. After finishing her novel three years later, she submitted it to Sweet Dreams, but was rejected. Pottinger graduated from Harvard with a degree in Art History. During her senior year of college, she realized that she did not know what she wanted to do with her degree and decided to attend medical school. That decision required her to attend two additional years of college to complete the science prerequisites necessary to apply for medical school. To occupy herself during the long days of studying science, Pottinger began to write light-hearted Regency romance novels. A few weeks after she was accepted to medical school, she discovered that her first two novels, Splendid and Dancing At Midnight, had been sold at auction, an unusual occurrence for a novice romance author. She postponed medical school for two years while she wrote two more novels. By the time Pottinger finally entered Yale School of Medicine to realize her dream of being a doctor, three of her books had been published. After only a few short months of studying medicine, however, Pottinger realized that she preferred writing to dissections. She left medical school and devoted herself full-time to her writing. Pottinger considers herself a feminist and gives her heroines feminist qualities that are not necessarily true to the attitudes of the times her novels are set in. Her books are noted for being full of humor, with sharp, witty dialogue. The novels are primarily character-driven, lacking the great external conflicts that many romance novels employ. One of her novels, When He was Wicked, was highly unusual for a romance novel, as the first four chapters actually describe the heroine in a happy marriage with someone who is not the hero, and then shows the death of the original husband and deals with the grief of both the heroine and hero before allowing the second love story to flourish. Most of her books are dedicated to her husband, Paul Pottinger, often with references to amusing alternate titles for the work. She won the Romance Writers of America RITA Award for 2007 for On the Way to the Wedding and again for 2008 for The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever. When she won for 2010 for What Happens in London, she became (at the time) the youngest member and is now one of only 16 authors to be inducted into the RWA Hall of Fame. In 2003, she enjoyed the rare honor of being profiled in Time Magazine, an accomplishment few romance novelists have achieved. In 2005 Publishers Weekly gave To Sir Phillip, With Love a rare starred review, and later named it one of the six best mass market original novels of the year. Each of her last 17 novels has appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List, with Mr. Cavendish, I Presume hitting number one in October 2008. Most recently, The Girl With the Make-Believe Husband was on the NYT list in June 2017. Additionally to those, both her Lady Whistledown anthologies appeared on the NY Times list, as did both of her novel-in-three- part collaborations with Connie Brockway and Eloisa James (The Lady Most Likely and The Lady Most Willing), and the Bridgertons: Happily Ever After collection of Bridgertons second epilogues. In 2001, Pottinger won $79,000 on The Weakest Link. She is an avid reader, posting recommendations of her favorite books on her Facebook page. Pottinger and her husband live in the Pacific Northwest area of the United States.

He is best known for his production work since the 1980s and, before that, being one half of the new wave band the Buggles (with Geoff Downes). Horn took up the bass guitar at an early age and taught himself the instrument and to sight-read music. In the 1970s, he worked as a session musician, built his own studio, and wrote and produced singles for various artists. Horn and Downes gained international fame in 1979 with the Buggles' hit single \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\". This was followed by their one-year tenure with the progressive rock band Yes, with Horn becoming their lead singer. In 1981, Horn became a full-time producer, working on commercially successful songs and albums for numerous artists, among them Dollar, ABC, Malcolm McLaren, Yes, and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. He ventured into business with his wife Jill Sinclair, purchasing SARM West Studios and establishing the publishers Perfect Songs and their own label, ZTT Records. In the following year, Horn co-formed the electronic group Art of Noise. In the 1990s, Horn's success continued with his association with Seal. He has been a member of the supergroup Producers, later known as the Trevor Horn Band, since 2006. Horn has won numerous awards, including three Brit Awards for Best British Producer in 1983, 1985, and 1992. He won a Grammy Award for producing Seal's 1994 hit \\"Kiss from a Rose\\". In 2010, Horn received an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. His influence on pop and electronic music in the 1980s was such that he has been called \\"The Man Who Invented the Eighties\\". Early life Trevor Charles Horn was born on 15 July 1949 to John and Elizabeth Horn in the city of Durham, England, and grew up in nearby Stonebridge. The second of four children, Horn has two sisters, Janet and Marjorie, and a brother, Ken Horn. His father was a civil engineer at the neighbouring dairy and a semi- professional musician who played the double bass in the Joe Clarke Big Band during the week. Horn attended Johnston Grammar School in Durham. At around eight years of age, Horn took up the double bass and was taught the basics by his father, including the concept of playing triads. He then taught himself the bass guitar and became confident in sight-reading music, using guide books and practising on his father's four-string guitar in the spare room of the house. In his early teens, Horn would fill in for his father on the double bass in the Joe Clarke band when he was late for a gig. At school Horn was given a recorder which he picked up with little effort as he already had music knowledge, and performed in the local youth orchestra. His interests soon turned to contemporary rock acts such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan. At fourteen Horn played electric guitar in his first group, The Outer Limits, named after the 1963 television series of the same name, playing mainly covers by The Kinks.\\"Buggles to be honoured at the Prog Awards!\\", Prog, issue 69, p. 12 Horn went on to pursue a \\"succession of day jobs\\", including one at a rubber company. He also put on a Bob Dylan imitation act for two nights a week \\"with a harmonica around my neck\\", and played the bass at odd gigs. Then, at seventeen, Horn decided to pursue a career in music and \\"woke my parents up at 4am to tell them\\". They were reluctant at first as they wanted him to become a chartered accountant as he performed well in maths, but Horn had failed the required exams. Horn's parents pleaded with him to try one more job, but three months into his role as a progress chaser in a plastic bag factory, he was fired. \\"I said, 'That's it, I'm never going into that world again!'\\", and the next day, received an offer to play the bass in a local semi-professional band at a Top Rank Ballroom, playing top 40 and dance music for ¬£24 a week for five nights' work. Horn also received airplay on BBC Radio Leicester, performing self-written songs on a guitar. Career =1971‚Äì1979: Early work= At 21, Horn relocated to London and took up work by playing in a band which involved re-recording top 20 songs for BBC radio due to the needle time restrictions then in place. This was followed by a one-year tenure with Ray McVay's big band, and earning as a session musician, producing jingles, records, and working with rock groups. His time with Ray McVay included performances at the world ballroom dancing championship and the television show Come Dancing. At 24, Horn began a period of work in Leicester where his growing interest in recording studios led to his assistance in the construction of a studio in the city, while playing the bass at Bailey's club for seven nights for money. Upon completion of the studio, Horn produced songs for local artists, including a song for Leicester City F.C. By 1976, Horn had returned to London. He played bass in Northern Lights, a covers band, which also featured keyboardist Geoff Downes and disco singer Tina Charles. Horn went on to form Tracks, a jazz fusion band inspired by Weather Report and Herbie Hancock, with future Shakatak drummer Roger Odell, before he left the group to play in Tina Charles's backing band. The two entered a short relationship, and Horn learned a lot from her inspiring producer Biddu. Also featured in Charles's band were Horn's future Buggles partners, keyboardist Geoffrey Downes and guitarist Bruce Woolley. In the mid-1970s, Horn worked for a music publishers on Denmark Street in London, producing demos which sometimes had Horn in charge of producing a master if a deal for a demo was made. From 1977 to 1979, Horn worked on various singles either as a songwriter, producer, or orchestra director, \\"without ever making any money out of it\\". Among his first was \\"Natural Dance\\" by Tony Cole and \\"Don't Come Back\\" by Fallen Angel and the T.C. Band, featuring Woolley as songwriter, which Horn produced under the name \\"T.C. Horn\\". He wrote \\"Boot Boot Woman\\", the B-side to the Boogatti single \\"Come Back Marianne\\", under his real name. In 1978, Horn wrote, sang, and produced \\"Caribbean Air Control\\" under the pseudonym Big A, which features Horn pictured as a pilot on the front sleeve. In 1979, a full studio album by Chromium, a \\"sci-fi disco project\\" named Star to Star was released that featured Horn and Downes as songwriters and producers, and Horn's future Art of Noise bandmate Anne Dudley on keyboards. Other artists that Horn worked with included Woolley, John Howard, Dusty Springfield (\\"Baby Blue\\") and The Jags (\\"Back of My Hand\\"). Horn scored his first production hit when \\"Monkey Chop\\" by Dan-I reached No. 17 on the UK singles chart in 1979. =1978‚Äì1981: The Buggles and Yes= In 1978, Horn and Downes formed the new wave band The Buggles with early contributions from Woolley. They secured a recording deal with Island Records and spent much of 1979 recording their debut album, The Age of Plastic (1980). The credits list Horn with co-production, lead vocals, guitar and bass. Its lead single \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" was released in September 1979 and reached No. 1 in the UK, propelling Horn, then aged 30, and Downes to mainstream fame. In August 1981, the song was the first music video to air on MTV. The success of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" led to Horn and Downes secure management from Brian Lane, who was also managing the progressive rock band Yes. They were in need of a singer and keyboardist following the departures of Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman, which led to Horn and Downes pitching \\"We Can Fly from Here\\", a demo that they had written with Yes in mind. Both accepted to join Yes and work got underway on Drama (1980) with Horn on lead vocals and fretless bass. Horn spent much of his time on the album, and cut his wedding reception short in order to resume working on it. Horn sang on the band's 1980 tour of North America and the UK, after which he left to become a full-time producer. In 1981, he completed a second Buggles album Adventures in Modern Recording largely on his own following Downes's decision to form Asia. Horn resumed working with Yes as a producer on their albums 90125 (1983) and Big Generator (1987). Horn rated \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\", the lead single from 90125, as technically his best work. =1981‚Äìpresent: Producer and other projects= 1980s In early 1981, Horn left Yes and became a full-time producer. His wife advised him to branch off from being an instrumental musician as he could reach greater success in production, and subsequently she became Horn's manager. He assembled a studio rig which included a Roland TR-808 drum machine and sequencer and a set of Simmons electronic drum modules. He spent ¬£18,000 on a Fairlight CMI synthesiser, one of four in the country at the time. \\"I knew what it was capable of, because I understood what it did. Most other people didn't understand at the time ‚Äì sampling was like a mystical world\\". Horn realised he needed full-time assistance in operating the machine and hired J. J. Jeczalik to programme it. For his use of the Fairlight, Horn is credited as the \\"key architect\\" in incorporating sampling into \\"the language of pop\\". Horn had commercial success with his first project, The Dollar Album (1982) by pop duo Dollar, which his wife had assigned him to work on. He co- wrote and produced four songs that follow a love story across them: \\"Mirror Mirror\\", \\"Hand Held in Black and White\\", \\"Give Me Back My Heart\\", and \\"Videotheque\\". All four became top 20 hits in the UK. The potent production work made him noticed by other bands and it was followed by even greater success with The Lexicon of Love (1982) by ABC, which reached No. 1 on the UK albums chart. It was during these sessions that Horn acquired a LinnDrum drum machine, and assembled a team that would characterise and define the sound of much of his work in the 1980s, with Dudley on keyboards and arrangements, Gary Langan and later Stephen Lipson as chief engineer, Jeczalik as programmer, backing vocalist Tessa Webb, and percussionist Luis Jardim. In 1982, Horn and his wife formed a music publishing company, Perfect Songs. This coincided with their then recent acquisition of Basing Street Studios, which also housed the fledgling publishing company. Perfect Songs was able to harness and develop the up-and-coming young artists working in the recording studio. The first to be signed were Frankie Goes to Hollywood, followed by Art of Noise and Propaganda. These first few signings to the company were instrumental in establishing the company ethos of \\"innovation and artiste development, taking risks and signing acts far into the left field\\". In 1983, Horn and his wife purchased Basing Street Studios in west London from Chris Blackwell and renamed it SARM West Studios. The deal included the rights for them to operate a record label through Island Record's distribution which led to the formation of ZTT Records with NME writer Paul Morley. It is named after the sound poem of the same name by Italian futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. During 1982 and 1983, Horn worked with Malcolm McLaren and Anne Dudley, writing numerous worldwide hits including \\"Buffalo Gals\\", \\"Double Dutch\\", \\"Duck for the Oyster\\" and the Duck Rock album. In 1983, Horn also co-formed Art of Noise, co-writing several hits including \\"Close (To the Edit)\\", \\"Beat Box\\", \\"Moments in Love\\", and \\"Slave to the Rhythm\\". This was originally intended as Frankie Goes to Hollywood's second single, but was instead given to Grace Jones. Horn and his studio team reworked and reinterpreted it, jazz style, into six separate songs to form Jones's album Slave to the Rhythm. Horn got David Gilmour to play the guitar. In 1984, Horn was approached by Bob Geldof to produce the song \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\", but he was unavailable. Instead, he gave use of SARM West Studio free of charge to the project for 24 hours, which Geldof accepted, assigning Midge Ure as the producer instead. The song was recorded and mixed on 25 November. Horn produced the B-side featuring messages from artists who had and had not made the recording, including David Bowie, Annie Lennox, Paul McCartney, Big Country, and Holly Johnson. They were also recorded over the same backing track as the \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" Several musicians have described Horn's style of production as dominating. Frankie Goes to Hollywood's debut album Welcome to the Pleasuredome barely featured any of the band's performances, instead featuring Horn and session musicians (lead single \\"Relax\\" cost ¬£70,000 spent across three sessions that included scrapped versions by the band and by Ian Dury's backing band, before Horn re-recorded the song himselfReynolds, p. 380); and the Pet Shop Boys remarked that although Horn had promised to complete their single \\"Left to My Own Devices\\" in a couple of weeks, it took several months for them to receive the final mix due to the lavish live orchestration and studio work. In the late 1980s, Horn relocated to Bel Air, Los Angeles where he established Sarm West Coast LA, a residential recording studio. 1990s In 1990, Horn produced English musician Seal's eponymous debut album. This began a multi- album collaboration which Horn reasoned down to his liking of Seal's voice and a \\"musical empathy\\" with how he works and the songs he writes. Seal reached No. 1 in the UK and lead single \\"Crazy\\" went to No. 2. The album marked a turning point in Horn's production method, switching typical studio hardware for computers, and recorded tracks on Seal using MIDI and Studio Vision software. Horn was pleased with the results and sold his PC equipment for an Apple Macintosh. At this stage of his career, Horn had lost his enthusiasm for producing 12-inch mixes of songs and brought in other remixers to make them, while concentrating on albums. In the 1990s, Horn wrote two songs for solo female singers. \\"Riding into Blue (Cowboy Song)\\" was recorded by Inga Humpe and \\"Docklands\\" was recorded by Betsy Cook. He also co-wrote two songs with Terry Reid for his 1991 album, The Driver and \\"The Shape of Things to Come\\" for Cher's 1995 album It's a Man's World. Horn co-produced Mike Oldfield's 1992 album Tubular Bells II alongside Oldfield and Tom Newman. Horn co-wrote the theme song \\"Everybody Up\\" to the TV programme The Glam Metal Detectives, a comedy sketch show which appeared on BBC Two in 1995. This was another collaboration with Lol Creme. Horn's songwriting can be heard on numerous film soundtracks. In 1992, Horn collaborated with composer Hans Zimmer to produce the score for the film Toys, which included interpretations by Tori Amos, Pat Metheny and Thomas Dolby. In the mid-1990s, Horn bought Hook End Manor and renamed its recording facility SARM Hook End. He put the property on sale in 2007 for ¬£12 million and relocated to Primrose Hill in London. In 1995, Horn produced \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\", a rerecording of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" by Genesis which featured vocals from their former singers Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. It was released on their Turn It On Again: The Hits (1999) box set. 2000s In the 2000s, Horn provided additional production on three international hits for t.A.T.u., \\"All the Things She Said\\", \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", and \\"Clowns (Can You See Me Now)\\". He also produced the theme tune to the 2000 film Coyote Ugly, \\"Can't Fight the Moonlight\\", recorded by Leann Rimes, co-wrote \\"Pass the Flame\\" (the official torch relay song for the 2004 Olympics in Athens) in collaboration with Lol Creme and co-wrote the title track from Lisa Stansfield's 2004 album The Moment. He co-wrote \\"Sound The Bugle\\", performed by Bryan Adams and featured on the Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron soundtrack. and: produced 3 tracks (La Sombra del Gigante, Un Angel No Es and Mujer Amiga Mia) of Stilelibero (Freestyle) Estilolibre by Eros Ramazzotti, released on 29 May 2001. On 11 November 2004, a Prince's Trust charity concert celebrating Horn's 25 years as a record producer took place at Wembley Arena. Performers at the show included The Buggles, Bruce Woolley, ABC, Art of Noise, Belle & Sebastian, Lisa Stansfield, Pet Shop Boys, Seal, Dollar, Propaganda, t.A.T.u., Yes, Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood (with Ryan Molloy replacing original vocalist Holly Johnson). A double album, Produced by Trevor Horn, was released in conjunction with the concert. An edited version of the concert has been broadcast on television in several countries under the title 25 Years of Pop: Produced by Trevor Horn, and a DVD release of the full concert called Slaves to the Rhythm is available. Trevor Horn performing with the Producers in 2012. In 2006, Horn co-formed the supergroup Producers, in which Horn plays with various musicians/producers, namely Lol Creme, producer Steve Lipson, drummer Ash Soan and initially singer/songwriter Chris Braide. The band performed its first gig at the Camden Barfly in November 2006. They continue to perform, now under the name the Trevor Horn Band. On 22 May 2006, the Pet Shop Boys released their album Fundamental which was produced by Horn. The album reached No. 5 in the UK chart.

Horn also produced Captain's debut album, This is Hazelville, released late 2006. He has also worked with John Legend and David Jordan. For the 2008 movie Wanted (starring James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie), Horn produced Danny Elfman's vocals on the closing credits song \\"The Little Things\\". In 2009, Horn produced the album Reality Killed The Video Star for Robbie Williams. Aside from the album title paying homage to Horn's hit single with The Buggles back in 1979, it also reflects Horn and Williams' mutual disdain for the ongoing crop of reality television and music contest programmes in the UK and elsewhere. Ironically, the album was Williams' first studio album not to reach number 1 in the UK, beaten to the top spot by the debut album by JLS, who were runners- up on television's \\"The X Factor\\" in 2008. 2010s Horn was also the executive producer of Jeff Beck's album, Emotion & Commotion, released in early 2010. He returned to work with Yes again, producing their new album from October 2010.Classic Rock Presents... Prog (Oct 2010 issue) That album, 2011's Fly From Here, is a reunion of sorts for Horn's former bandmate Geoff Downes; not only is Downes a member of the band's current incarnation, but the album also takes its title from a song written by Horn and Downes and performed by Yes during their original stint with the band in 1980. In 2017, Horn wrote the music for the Stan Lee co-produced anime \\"The Reflection ‚Äì Wave One\\", the soundtrack being released, the first album under Trevor Horn's name. In January 2018, Horn played the bass with Dire Straits Legacy for their Brazilian tour. He continued to tour with the band throughout the year.

He has also been working on musicals, including one called \\"The Robot Sings\\". In November 2018, Horn performed a one-off concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. Horn's new album, Trevor Horn Reimagines the Eighties, was released on 25 January 2019.

During his whole life he was furthermore ruler of the Principality of Orange- Nassau within the Holy Roman Empire. Early life William was born in Leeuwarden, Netherlands, the son of John William Friso, Prince of Orange, head of the Frisian branch of the House of Orange-Nassau, and of his wife Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). He was born six weeks after the death of his father. William succeeded his father as Stadtholder of Friesland and also, under the regency of his mother until 1731, as Stadtholder of Groningen. In 1722 he was elected Stadtholder of Guelders. The four other provinces of the Dutch Republic:, Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht and Overijssel had in 1702 decided not to appoint a stadtholder after the death of stadtholder William III, issuing the history of the Republic into a period that is known as the Second Stadtholderless Period. In 1747 those four provinces also accepted William as their stadtholder. Marriage and children In 1720 William was named the 549th Knight of the Order of the Garter. On 25 March 1734 he married at St James's Palace Anne, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach. William and Anne had five children: * a stillborn daughter (born 19 December 1736) * a stillborn daughter (born 22 December 1739) * Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau (28 February 1743 ‚Äì 6 May 1787), married Karl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg * Princess Anna of Orange-Nassau (15 November 1746 ‚Äì 29 December 1746) * William V, Prince of Orange (8 March 1748 ‚Äì 9 April 1806) Later life Portrait of William, 1751 In 1739 William inherited the estates formerly owned by the Nassau-Dillenburg branch of his family, and in 1743 he inherited those formerly owned by the Nassau-Siegen branch of his family. In April 1747 the French army entered Flanders, threatening the Netherlands, which was weakened by internal division. The Dutch decided that their country needed a single strong executive, and turned to the House of Orange. William and his family moved from Leeuwarden to The Hague. On 4 May 1747, the States General of the Netherlands named William General Stadtholder of all seven of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, and made the position hereditary for the first time. William first met Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L√ºneburg in 1747, and two years later appointed him field marshal of the Dutch States Army, which later led to Louis Ernest serving as one of the regents for William's heir. William IV was considered an attractive, educated, and accomplished prince in his prime. Although he had little experience in state affairs, William was at first popular with the people. He stopped the practice of indirect taxation by which independent contractors managed to make large sums for themselves. Nevertheless, he was also a Director-General of the Dutch East India Company, and his alliance with the business class deepened while the disparity between rich and poor grew. William served as General Stadtholder of all the Netherlands until he died of a stroke in 1751 at The Hague. The county of Orange, Virginia, and the city of Orangeburg, South Carolina, are named after him.

Products description EFKE KB21 Black & white film The Efke films are black-and-white films with high silver content and as a result give a large exposure latitude and high quality grayscale reproduction when compared with modern films. The Efke 25, 50 and 100 products were made using the ADOX formulas that were first introduced in the 1950s. Efke also made an infrared film sold as Efke IR820. The Efke films are more forgiving of exposure variations than modern tabular crystal films. The nature of the product also allows large, grain free, enlargements to be made from negatives. Efke films were coated in one layer, unlike most other films which are coated in multiple layers. This makes the film thinner and the emulsion more easily damaged, especially when still wet after development. A hardening fixer can be used to help protect the emulsion. The film base is also thinner and more transparent, making inspection of the negative easier. However it can also make the film curl more easily. Efke was one of the last manufacturers still making the once-popular 127 film, and indeed was the only manufacturer in the world making 127 format film between 1995, when Kodak discontinued the format, and 2006, when a Canadian company also began making 127. Efke's Infrared Film, sold under the brand name Efke IR820 was the only infrared film manufactured that has good IR sensitivity beyond 750 nm extending out to 820 nm. In the past other films such as Kodak's HIE offered this but have recently been discontinued and are no longer made. Closing Fotokemika ceased all production in June 2012. The company currently exists as a distributor of medical films and materials made by other manufacturers. There have been efforts to save the Fotokemika heritage.

Signatories of those treaties agree to standardize possible limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights under their respective national copyright laws.  Berne Convention  The three-step test was first established in relation to the exclusive right of reproduction under Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in 1967. Article 9 of the Berne Convention states that: > Right of Reproduction: 1. Generally; 2. Possible exceptions; 3. Sound and > visual recordings - (1) Authors of literary and artistic works protected by > this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the > reproduction of these works, in any manner or form. (2) It shall be a matter > for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of > such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does > not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not > unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author. (3) Any sound > or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction for the purposes > of this Convention. The three-step test in Article 9(2) of the Berne does not apply to copyright exceptions that are implemented under other parts of the Berne convention that have a separate standard, such as those in articles 2(4), 2(7), 2(8), 2 bis, 10, 10 bis and 13(1), or the Berne Appendix. = Other copyright treaties = Since then, the three-step test has been modified and transplanted into the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the WIPO Copyright Treaty (Article 10), the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (Article 16(2)), the EU Computer Programs Directive (Article 6(3)), the EU Database Directive (Article 6(3)), and the EU Copyright Directive (Article 5(5)). The test as included in Article 13 of TRIPs reads: > \\"Members shall confine limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights to > certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of > the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the > rights holder.\\" The WTO three-step test does not apply to cases where the Berne or Rome Conventions provide separate standards for exceptions, or for rights not covered in the TRIPS Agreement.  Interpretation  The technical legal reasoning which has been applied to suggest how this wording should be interpreted is arcane (see the references below). To date, only one case (before a WTO dispute settlement panel, involving U.S. copyright exemptions allowing restaurants, bars and shops to play radio and TV broadcasts without paying licensing fees, passed in 1998 as a rider to the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act) has actually required an interpretation of the test. The three-step test may prove to be extremely important if any nations attempt to reduce the scope of copyright law, because unless the WTO decides that their modifications comply with the test, such states are likely to face trade sanctions. Exceptions to copyright protection are required to be clearly defined and narrow in scope and reach.Sam Ricketson (2003), WIPO Study on Limitations and Exceptions of Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Environment For instance, the three-step test was invoked as a justification for refusing certain exceptions to copyright wished for by members of the French parliament during the examination of the controversial DADVSI copyright bill.  Patents  TRIPs Article 30, covering limitations and exemptions to patent law, is also derived from a somewhat different three-step test, that includes \\"taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.\\" Exceptions to exclusive patent rights are not subject to this test if they are implemented through Article 31 of the TRIPS, or Articles 6, 40 or 44.2.

On 1 January 2012 Dalhem had a total population of 6,996. The total area is 36.06 km¬≤ which gives a population density of 180 inhabitants per km¬≤. The name Dalhem is of Germanic origin and means \\"place of residence in the valley\\" (lit. dale home/dale ham).  Locations in the Municipality  The municipality of Dalhem consists of the village of Dalhem as well as the following locations: Saint-Andr√©, Berneau (German: Bernau), Bombaye (Dutch: Bolbeek), Feneur, Mortroux, Neufch√¢teau and Warsage (Dutch: Weerst). The current municipality was formed during the fusion of the Belgian municipalities in 1977. The Ch√¢teau de Wod√©mont is within the municipality.  History  Already in 1080 a fortress was built in Dalhem on a high rock, where the Berwijn and Bolland rivers merged. Dalhem experienced its first major development since the 12th century, when a few \\"lords of Voeren\\" began moving to Dalhem in 1180 and began calling themselves \\"lords of Dalhem.\\" Then their goods were transferred to the Count of Hochstaden, making Dalhem a county. The town of Dalhem grew into the administrative center and core of the county of Dalhem, next to 's-Gravenvoeren (the original Voeren), where the legal power resided. In 1244 it definitively lost its independence and has since then fallen indirectly under the duchy of Brabant. In 1239, after the duke had defeated the last count of Dalhem, Dirk van Hochstaden, a treaty was concluded in 1244, whereby Dirk van Hochstaden left Dalhem to Brabant for good. From now on a final bailiff or cross-country would take over the reign in the name of the duke. Together with Valkenburg and Rolduc, Dalhem was henceforth referred to in the official documents as the 'Countries of Overmaas'. This was sometimes also considered Limburg, as a result of which the four countries together received the title 'Province of Limburg'. Until the dissolution of the county of Dalhem in 1797, the town of Dalhem was furthermore the capital of the county and the capital of one of the Dalhem possession. The county of Dalhem was one of the Countries of Overmaas. In 1648 the Netherlands were divided into a Spanish section and the souvereign Dutch Republic. On December 26, 1661, the castle and town of Dalhem became part of the souvereign part of the County of Dalhem (State Partage) as a result of the Partagetraktaat (division treaty) between the Republic of the seven United Netherlands and Spain. Economically, the coal mines around Dalhem were of particular importance to the Dutch, while the place itself provided a good military base against the enemy through its castle. In 1665, Robert van Ittersum built the town hall in Dalhem, which today still houses a Nassau coat of arms with the lion above the gate. The town hall itself underwent several renovations over time (1840, 1927). On November 8, 1785, Austria and the States General signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau, whereby a large part of the county of Dalhem, including the town of Dalhem, was ceded to Austria by the States General in exchange for parts of Austrian Valkenburg. Dalhem thus became part of the Southern Austrian Netherlands. For many residents this was a liberation. After all, Protestantism imposed too high demands on the Catholic population. Warsage was one of the first villages to be captured in the German invasion of Belgium at the start of World War I in August 1914. Six Belgian civilians were executed by the German Army in reprisals on the first day of the occupation. Like the rest of the county, insofar as it was located in the Austrian Netherlands, Dalhem was included in the annexation of the Southern Netherlands by the French Republic in 1797 in the newly formed department of Ourthe; which was later transformed into the province of Li√®ge in the time of the United Netherlands.  Legend  According to Nicolas R√©my, in his work Daemonolatreiae libri tres the succubus Abrahel appeared in Dalhem in the year 1581.

The municipality of Seraing includes the old communes of Boncelles, Jemeppe-sur- Meuse, and Ougr√©e. With Li√®ge, Herstal, Saint-Nicolas, Ans, and Fl√©malle, it forms the greater Li√®ge agglomeration (600,000 inhabitants). To the south of Seraing are the Condroz and the Ardennes regions. In addition to its steel factories, Seraing is home to the crystal manufacture Val Saint Lambert, which has been operating on the site of an old Cistercian abbey since 1826. The site of the Arcelor steel company, previously known as Cockerill-Sambre, is the former summer residence of the prince-bishops of Li√®ge. History =Antiquity and Middle Ages= Several skeletons, potshards, weapons, and jewels were discovered here, dating from the 5th and 6th century, attesting to Seraing being inhabited in Frankish times. The first mention of Saran dates from 956, when a Carolingian farming domain extending on both sides of the Meuse River and owned by someone named Saran was donated to the abbey of Sint- Truiden. The whole territory soon passed to the Bishopric of Li√®ge. In the 11th century, Prince-Bishop Henri I of Verdun used a house in Seranus to entertain guests. Throughout the Middle Ages, the inhabitants of Seraing owed allegiance to Li√®ge, pledging to defend the fluvial approach to the city in case of invasion, in exchange for tax exonerations. The first wooden bridge across the river, which replaced the ferry, was built in 1381. =Industrial development= 240px The name of the town changed several times throughout its history, with the current spelling only being set in the 18th century. At around that time, various factors combined to attract industrial investors to Seraing: the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the proximity of the Meuse River, and the discovery of coal at Ougr√©e. The first ironworks were founded there in 1809. John Cockerill and his brother James revolutionized the steel industry by using blast furnaces and coke instead of traditional charcoal. These inventions would be the basis for his new company, John Cockerill & Cie established in Seraing in 1817. Over the next decades, many more metallurgical plants and foundries were built in this area, which became an integral part of Wallonia's industrial backbone, the sillon industriel. Glassworkers found the proximity of a cheap source of coal attractive. The Val Saint Lambert started its operations in 1826. Seraing was the first location in Belgium where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built in Belgium. Work began on the building in 1927 and completed before the end of 1930.Jenson, Andrew. Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

After the end of coal mining, the mines were cleaned and residences as well as shopping areas were built on. Some buildings are kept and transformed into tourism activities (such as \\"le domaine du Bas-Bois\\"). Since 1980, due to the higher number of people leaving big cities (Li√®ge and Verviers) to more rural municipalities, and due to the highway E40 (European route E40) passing on its territory, Soumagne recovers from the loss of coal mining and the end of the \\"Cooperative\\".

The municipality encompasses the following places: Dolembreux, Gomz√©-Andoumont, Rouvreux, Louveign√©, Banneux, Damr√©, Florz√©, Linc√©, Ogn√©, Presseux, and Rivage. On January 1, 2006, Sprimont had a total population of 12,782. The total area is which gives a population density of 172 inhabitants per km2. Etymology Sprimont is an ancient name, the earliest written records of which date from 855 and 856 AD. These are located in the Abbey of Stavelot. The etymology of Sprimont is uncertain. A priori, it seems to be the name of a place; however some historians propose that it may derive from a person's name.Bulletin et annales de l‚ÄôAcademie d‚ÄôArcheologie de Belgique, vol. XXXVIII, Bulletin de l'Institute Archeologique Liegeois, vol. VII Spellings of Sprimont may be different, depending on (1) the written language, and (2) the time period. Since Sprimont is more than 1,100 years old, a variety of different spellings are to be expected. For example, Ernst cites \\"Sprismonte\\" in 888 AD, and Martine & Duraud cite \\"Sprismont\\" in 1049. However, since about 1000 AD \\"Sprimont\\" seems to be exclusively used. In Bulletin de l'Institute Archeologique Liegeois (vol. VII), there are further references to the Teutonic Spir-Boum, Spereboum, Sper-Boun and the Frisian Spiri, Spere, Sper, as well as the Latin sorbus. These translate as 'speer', 'hasta,' and 'lance.' There is a consensus that the root is of a Latin origin. If this is correct, the suffix -mont is probably from mons, montis, meaning either hill or mountain. However, some historians point out that many geographical names with this suffix belong to places not on a hill, some of which are even in valleys. This may cast doubt on the true meaning being \\"hill\\", but another source indicates that mons was used in Roman times to indicate a way-station for travellers. As for the prefix of spri-, more debate is required, as its origin seems to be lost to antiquity. Ancient written documents indicate several possible Latin origins: spiris, spers. Regardless of the meaning of the root word, one must also consider the usage in the context of the name itself. For example, if it does indeed refer to a species of tree or wood, in those ancient times, what was the connotation? It has been argued persuasively that 'spri' means 'lance'. Concluding the etymology of Sprimont, the active might mean 'Mounted Warrior,' whereas the passive might mean 'Lance of Defence.' This is from mont de Spiris.

The route and rolling stock of the Orient Express changed many times. Several routes in the past concurrently used the Orient Express name, or slight variations. Although the original Orient Express was simply a normal international railway service, the name became synonymous with intrigue and luxury travel. The two city names most prominently associated with the Orient Express are Paris and Constantinople (Istanbul), the original endpoints of the timetabled service. The Orient Express was a showcase of luxury and comfort at a time when travelling was still rough and dangerous. In 1977, the Orient Express stopped serving Istanbul. Its immediate successor, a through overnight service from Paris to Bucharest‚Äîsince 1991 only to Budapest, and in 2001 again shortened to Vienna‚Äîran for the last time from Paris on Friday 8 June 2007. After this, the route, still called the \\"Orient Express\\", was shortened to start from Strasbourg instead, occasioned by the inauguration of the LGV Est which afforded much shorter travel times from Paris to Strasbourg. The new curtailed service left Strasbourg at 22:20 daily, shortly after the arrival of a TGV from Paris, and was attached at Karlsruhe to the overnight sleeper service from Amsterdam to Vienna. On 14 December 2009, the Orient Express ceased to operate and the route disappeared from European railway timetables, reportedly a \\"victim of high-speed trains and cut-rate airlines\\". The Venice-Simplon Orient Express train, a private venture by Belmond using original CIWL carriages from the 1920s and 1930s, continues to run from London to Venice and to other destinations in Europe, including the original route from Paris to Istanbul.  Train Eclair de luxe (the \\"test\\" train)  CIWL logo In 1882, Georges Nagelmackers, a Belgian banker's son, invited guests to a railway trip of on his \\"Train Eclair de luxe\\" (\\"lightning luxury train\\"). The train left Paris Gare de l'Est on Tuesday, October 10, 1882, just after 18:30 and arrived in Vienna the next day at 23:20. The return trip left Vienna on Friday, October 13 at 16:40 and, as planned, at 20:00 on Saturday October 14. Georges Nagelmackers was the founder of Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which expanded its luxury trains, travel agencies and hotels all over Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its most famous train remains the Orient-Express. The train was composed of: * Baggage car * Sleeping coach with 16 beds (with bogies) * Sleeping coach with 14 beds (3 axles) * Restaurant coach (nr. 107) * Sleeping coach with 13 beds (3 axles) * Sleeping coach with 13 beds (3 axles) * Baggage car (complete 101 ton) The first menu on board (October 10, 1882): oysters, soup with Italian pasta, turbot with green sauce, chicken ‚Äò√† la chasseur‚Äô, fillet of beef with ‚Äòch√¢teau‚Äô potatoes, ‚Äòchaud-froid‚Äô of game animals, lettuce, chocolate pudding, buffet of desserts. 750x750px  Routes  Original train The first Orient Express in 1883 On June 5, 1883, the first Express d'Orient left Paris for Vienna. Vienna remained the terminus until October 4, 1883. The train was officially renamed Orient Express in 1891. The original route, which first ran on October 4, 1883, was from Paris, Gare de l'Est, to Giurgiu in Romania via Munich and Vienna. At Giurgiu, passengers were ferried across the Danube to Ruse, Bulgaria, to pick up another train to Varna. They then completed their journey to Constantinople by ferry. In 1885, another route began operations, this time reaching Constantinople via rail from Vienna to Belgrade and Ni≈°, carriage to Plovdiv, and rail again to ƒ∞stanbul. WL Orient Express In 1889, the train's eastern terminus became Varna in the Principality of Bulgaria, where passengers could take a ship to Constantinople. On June 1, 1889, the first direct train to Constantinople left Paris (Gare de l'Est). Istanbul, known as Constantinople until circa 1930 in English, remained its easternmost stop until 19 May 1977. The eastern terminus was the Sirkeci Terminal by the Golden Horn. Ferry service from piers next to the terminal would take passengers across the Bosphorus to Haydarpa≈üa Terminal, the terminus of the Asian lines of the Ottoman Railways. The onset of the First World War in 1914 saw Orient Express services suspended. They resumed at the end of hostilities in 1918, and in 1919 the opening of the Simplon Tunnel allowed the introduction of a more southerly route via Milan, Venice, and Trieste. The service on this route was known as the Simplon Orient Express, and it ran in addition to continuing services on the old route. The Treaty of Saint-Germain contained a clause requiring Austria to accept this train: formerly, Austria allowed international services to pass through Austrian territory (which included Trieste at the time) only if they ran via Vienna. The Simplon Orient Express soon became the most important rail route between Paris and ƒ∞stanbul. Badge of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits on a car of the Orient Express The 1930s saw the Orient Express services at its most popular, with three parallel services running: the Orient Express, the Simplon Orient Express, and also the Arlberg Orient Express, which ran via Z√ºrich and Innsbruck to Budapest, with sleeper cars running onwards from there to Bucharest and Athens. During this time, the Orient Express acquired its reputation for comfort and luxury, carrying sleeping-cars with permanent service and restaurant cars known for the quality of their cuisine. Royalty, nobles, diplomats, business people, and the bourgeoisie in general patronized it. Each of the Orient Express services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from Calais to Paris, thus extending the service from one end of continental Europe to the other. WL Golden Arrow The start of the Second World War in 1939 again interrupted the service, which did not resume until 1945. During the war, the German Mitropa company had run some services on the route through the Balkans, but Yugoslav Partisans frequently sabotaged the track, forcing a stop to this service. Following the end of the war, normal services resumed except on the Athens leg, where the closure of the border between Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of Greece prevented services from running. That border re-opened in 1951, but the closure of the Bulgarian‚ÄìTurkish border from 1951 to 1952 prevented services running to ƒ∞stanbul during that time. As the Iron Curtain fell across Europe, the service continued to run, but the Communist nations increasingly replaced the Wagon-Lits cars with carriages run by their own railway services. Luggage tag By 1962, the Orient Express and Arlberg Orient Express had stopped running, leaving only the Simplon Orient Express. This was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the Direct Orient Express, which ran daily cars from Paris to Belgrade, and twice weekly services from Paris to ƒ∞stanbul and Athens. In 1971, the Wagon-Lits company stopped running carriages itself and making revenues from a ticket supplement. Instead, it sold or leased all its carriages to the various national railway companies, but continued to provide staff for the carriages. 1976 saw the withdrawal of the Paris‚ÄìAthens direct service, and in 1977, the Direct Orient Express was withdrawn completely, with the last Paris‚Äìƒ∞stanbul service running on May 19 of that year. The withdrawal of the Direct Orient Express was thought by many to signal the end of the Orient Express as a whole, but in fact a service under this name continued to run from Paris to Bucharest as before (via Strasbourg, Munich, and Budapest). However, a through sleeping car from Paris to Bucharest ‚Äî and even eastwards from Vienna ‚Äî was only operated until 1982, and also a through seating car was only operated seasonally. This meant, that Paris‚ÄìBudapest and Vienna‚ÄìBucharest coaches were running overlapped, so a journey was only possible with changing carriages ‚Äî despite the unchanged name and numbering of the train. In 1991 the Budapest-Bucharest leg of the train was canceled, the new final station has become Budapest. In the summer season of 1999 and 2000 a sleeping car from Bucharest to Paris reappeared twice a week ‚Äî now operated by CFR. This continued until 2001, when the service was cut back to just Paris‚ÄìVienna, already in EuroNight quality ‚Äî but in both cases the coaches were in fact rather attached to a Paris‚ÄìStrasbourg express. This service continued daily, listed in the timetables under the name Orient Express, until June 8, 2007. With the opening of the LGV Est Paris‚ÄìStrasbourg high speed rail line on June 10, 2007, the Orient Express service was further cut back to Strasbourg‚ÄìVienna, departing nightly at 22:20 from Strasbourg, and still bearing the name, but lost the number 262/263 which was owned for decades. The remains of the train had a convenient connection from/to the Strasbourg-Paris TGV, but due to the less flexible prices the changing has become less attractive. In the last years through coaches between Vienna and Karlsruhe (continuing first to Dortmund, then to Amsterdam, and finally ‚Äî partly from Budapest ‚Äî to Frankfurt) were attached. The very last train with the name Orient-Express (now with a hyphen) departed from Vienna on the 10th of December 2009, and one day later from Strasbourg.The Sirkeci Terminal in ƒ∞stanbul  Route legacy  Though the final service ran only from Strasbourg to Vienna, it was possible to retrace the entire original Orient Express route with four trains: Paris‚ÄìStrasbourg, Strasbourg‚ÄìVienna, Vienna‚ÄìBelgrade, and Belgrade-ƒ∞stanbul, each of which were operated daily. Other routes from Paris to ƒ∞stanbul exist even today, such as Paris‚ÄìMunich‚ÄìBudapest‚ÄìBucharest‚Äìƒ∞stanbul, or Paris‚ÄìZ√ºrich‚ÄìBelgrade‚Äìƒ∞stanbul, all of which have comparable travel times of approximately 60 hours without delays. Train services across the border to Turkey were stopped through several years due to construction works, but they were reintroduced in June 2017, however, ending in ƒ∞stanbul's suburb Halkalƒ±, from where a transfer bus is provided to the city centre. The luxurious dining car, where scenes for Murder on the Orient Express and other films were filmed, is now in the OSE museum of Thessaloniki. The local authorities plan to refit the train to make it available for tourist use around the Balkans in the near future.  Privately run trains using the name  In 1976, the Swiss travel company Intraflug AG had first hired, then also bought, several CIWL-carriages, and operated them as Nostalgie Istanbul Orient Express from Z√ºrich to ƒ∞stanbul. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the Orient-Express was celebrated by a trip of this train from Paris to ƒ∞stanbul, and in 1988 it was run to Hong Kong via the Soviet Union and China. From there it was transferred by ferry to Japan, and used there for some excursions after regauging. After the failure of the American European Express (see below), Intraflug became bankrupt, and the carriages were taken over by the Reiseb√ºro Mittelthurgau. The sleeping cars and some other coaches (Pullmans, dining cars, luggage vans) were transferred to Russia and used between Moscow and the Mongolian-Chinese border. (The adjacent Chinese train was also branded for a while as China Orient Express; nowadays it's known as Shangri-La Express.) The remaining vehicles were used in Germany and Switzerland as diner trains until the company's 2003 bankruptcy. Since then the trains have been standing unused in different countries, as the new owners sort out problems with operations due to a lawsuit about the usage rights of the name Orient Express. In 1982, the Venice-Simplon Orient Express was established as a private venture, running restored 1920s and 1930s carriages from London to Venice. This service runs between March and November, and is firmly aimed at leisure travellers, with tickets costing over $3,120 per person from London to Venice (via Paris, Z√ºrich, Innsbruck, and Verona‚Äîalso, despite its name, the train is running via the Brenner Pass instead of the Simplon tunnel) including meals. Two or three times a year, Prague or Vienna and Budapest are also accessed, starting from Venice, and returning to Paris and London. Every September the train also goes from London and Paris to ƒ∞stanbul via Budapest, Sinaia, and Bucharest‚Äîin the last three cities a sightseeing (and in the two capitals an overnight in hotel) also takes place‚Äîthe return trip on the same route ends up in Venice. While the above-mentioned routes are available almost every year, some seasons have also included unique destinations, among them Cologne, Rome, Florence, Lucerne, the High Tatras, Krak√≥w, Dresden, Copenhagen, and Stockholm. Such a journey is provided currently to Berlin. Venice-Simplon Orient Express in Poland, in 2007 The company also offers a similarly themed luxury train in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand called the Eastern and Oriental Express, and operates other luxury overnight trains in Scotland, Ireland, and Peru. The Pullman Orient Express was established by the CIWL in 1994. This train has only Pullman and dining cars, but no sleepers. It's used for gourmet trips in France. After the legal disputes about the name it was taken over by the SNCF and operated since then as Pullman Orient-Express. In North America, the American Orient Express, formerly the American European Express and later GrandLuxe Express, operated several train sets in charter service between 1989 and 2008.

The Nord Express (Northern Express) was a train service introduced in 1896 by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons- Lits, which operated sleeping-cars, dining cars and trains deluxe all over Europe, including the Orient Express. It left Paris and travelled via Brussels, Cologne, Hanover, Berlin, K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) and Dvinsk (now Daugavpils) to Saint Petersburg. The founders of CIWL wanted to establish a direct link between Saint Petersburg and Lisbon to connect with ocean liners to America. The Nord Express in the French station of Noyon - Beginning of the 20th century Passengers from Russia had to change once in East Prussia at the German/Russian border because Russian railway tracks are of a wider gauge than those in Western Europe. In Paris there was a connecting service to the Sud Express (Southern Express) to Lisbon. This train service enabled people to travel across Europe in what was, by the standards of the time, a very fast and comfortable manner. After World War I the train was diverted to Warsaw instead of Saint Petersburg. After World War II the \\"iron curtain\\" and air travel caused the end to this famous train. Since World War II the name Nord Express has been used for the initially luxury and since 1951 ordinary night train between Paris and Copenhagen.

The town is also the capital of the Euroregion Meuse- Rhine. First mentioned in 1213 as belonging to the Duchy of Limburg, possession of Eupen passed to Brabant, Burgundy, the Holy Roman Empire and France before being given in 1815 to Prussia, which became part of the new German Empire in 1871. In 1919, after the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles transferred Eupen and the nearby municipality of Malmedy from Germany to Belgium. German remains the official language in Eupen, and the city serves as the capital for Belgium's German-speaking Community. The city has a small university, the ', offering bachelor's degrees in Education and Nursing. In 2010, Eupen's association football team, K.A.S. Eupen, became the first club from the German-speaking Community to play in the Belgian Pro League. On 1 January 2006 Eupen had a total population of 18,248 (8,892 males and 9,356 females). The total area is which gives a population density of 175.90 inhabitants per km2. Eupen is considered in Belgium to be a Roman Catholic region with strongly conservative views. History Map of Belgium in 1843: Eupen and the East Cantons were then German. =Early history= Eupen and the St. Nikolaus Chapel were first mentioned in 1213 as part of the Duchy of Limburg. In 1288, after the Battle of Worringen, the Duchy of Limburg was annexed by John I of Brabant. Brabant and Limburg were inherited by Burgundy in 1387, and Eupen was burnt to the ground during the war against the Guelders. Burgundy was dissolved in 1477 by the Austrian Habsburgs who then inherited Eupen after gaining both Limburg and Brabant. =Habsburgs and Germans= Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Charles V granted Eupen the privilege to conduct two markets per year in 1544. In 1555, both Brabant and Limburg were passed to the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs. Ten years later, Protestantism was mentioned for the first time in the town. In 1582, during the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Habsburgs, rebels burnt Eupen but did not take control of it. Bubonic plague reached Eupen in 1635, with devastating consequences. Eupen obtained its own court of law in 1648, and in 1674 received city rights, giving it greater recognition and autonomy. Six years later, textile manufacture was introduced to the city. In 1713, with the Treaty of Utrecht, Brabant and Limburg were returned to the Austrian Habsburgs. Revolutionary France took the city in 1794, incorporating it into the D√©partement Ourthe, pr√©fecture Li√®ge and sous-pr√©fecture Malmedy. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Eupen became part of the Prussian Rhine Province. All Prussian possessions became part of the German Empire in 1870, while Eupen itself enjoyed its popularity as a spa town. Records show that a weaver named 'Schunck' was established as early as 1776. His eldest son, Nikolaus Severin Schunck (1799‚Äì1865), had six sons, of whom the third oldest, Arnold, would later found the firm in Heerlen. The youngest son, Joseph, remained at the weaving mill and there is still a weaving mill in Kettenis run by descendants of Nikolaus. The company became the famous Schunck. =20th century= After the First World War, the 1919 Treaty of Versailles transferred Eupen and the nearby municipality of Malmedy from Germany to Belgium. The effect led to the formation of National Socialist groups in Eupen. From 1938 the Vesdre Dam was constructed (completed in 1950), creating Lake Eupen. In 1940, the German Third Reich invaded Belgium; in an attempt to reverse Versailles, Eupen and Malmedy were annexed to Germany. In September 1944, American forces reached Eupen which became a centre of fierce fighting in the Battle of the Bulge. In 1949, the left tower of the St Nikolaus Church burnt down. The city centre was affected by flooding in 1953. Eupen merged with the municipality of Kettenis in 1976, amidst protest from that town. In 1980, following a state reform ten years earlier, the German- Speaking Community of Belgium was established and Eupen was named as its capital. Climate Eupen has a cool oceanic climate with some continental influences due to it being elevated in comparison to most of Belgium. Eupen is also wetter and cloudier than Li√®ge in the valley to the west, as a result of orographic lift due to the elevation change. As a result of this along with frequent winter frosts, Eupen gets a significant snowfall amount by Belgian standards. It also gets 16.8 ice days on average each year, as in the day staying below .

The present municipality of Limbourg was formed in 1977 by the merger of the old municipalities of Limbourg, Bilstain, and Go√©.  Etymology and history  The second part of the name Limbourg is from burg meaning a fortified town, which is common in many parts of Europe where Germanic languages are spoken or have been spoken historically (see Germanic placename etymology). Concerning the first part of the name there are various theories. One is lint meaning \\"dragon\\". Another is that it refers back to the Roman-era limes, situated at boundaries of the Empire. It may also have been related to the material lim or lime.Berkel and Samplonius, \\"Het Plaatsnamenboek\\", 1989, Unieboek, Houten Jean-Louis Kupper has proposed that the fort was named by its founder Frederick after Limburg Abbey in Germany, which in his lifetime had important connection to his imperial patrons and the Abbey of Stavelot, for which he was advowee.Jean-Louis Kupper (2007) Les origines du duch√© de Limbourg-sur-Vesdre\\", Revue belge de Philologie et d'Histoire Ann√©e 85-3-4 pp. 609-637 Limbourg is located on top of a hill which in its turn is surrounded by the river Vesdre. This was a strong military advantage in the Middle Ages and allowed the city to defend itself against foreign invaders. In the Middle Ages, the ruling family came to have the rank of duke and so the town was the seat of the Duchy of Limburg, which was a part of the Lower Lorraine region of the Holy Roman Empire. The town featured in the War of the Spanish Succession, falling in 1703 to British and Dutch Republican forces led by the Duke of Marlborough.

Under the complex administrative structures of Belgium, which has separate structures for territorial administration and for language community rights, Malmedy is part of Wallonia and of the French Community of Belgium. But since it has a German speaking minority, it is one of Belgium's municipalities with language facilities (or \\"municipalities with facilities\\"). Malmedy and Waimes are the two Walloon municipalities with facilities for German speakers. The population of Malmedy is approximately 95% French speakers and 5% German speakers.http://www.malmedy.be/en/Tourisme/Malmedy/situation.html The variety of German spoken is Moselle Franconian.  Geology  = Seismic risks = In the Provinces of Li√®ge, Limburg and Hainaut, seismic activity is higher than in the rest of the country. Malmedy is one of the communes in zone 2, that is to say, the zone most susceptible to earthquakes, in Belgium. The earthquake of 1692, which touched the area of Verviers, as well as being responsible for landslides, took place in the valley of Warche east of B√©verc√© (in the south of the junction with the brook of Tr√¥ Maret). The remains and evidence, of these landslides, which affected the Conglomerate of Malmedy were discovered in March 2015. Ground surveys, subsequently, led to revisions of the local geological map.  History  Cathedral of Malmedy. The name of ‚ÄúMalmedy‚Äù comes from the Latin sentence ‚ÄúA malo mundarum,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúpurifying from evil‚Äù. The name originated due to regular flooding in the past from the Warche river, which passes through the town. The city was founded in 648 by Saint Remacle, Provost of Solignac abbey in France. He had established his Benedictine Monastery in Malmedy. Between this date and 1794, the history of Malmedy is linked to the religious Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy, a clerical microstate. For 1,146 years, Malmedy and Stavelot together formed the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy. Seventy-seven successive prince abbots of the Germanic Holy Roman Empire and the County of Logne led the state. However, a rivalry grew up rapidly between the two towns, because Saint Remacle decided to choose Stavelot as the main city of the Principality. In the 16th Century, a significant number of industries appeared in the area of Malmedy: cloth, leather and gunpowder production. In the 17th Century, Stavelot-Malmedy became the most important tannery centre in Europe. But the main industry in Malmedy was the papermaking industry. It brought considerable wealth to the town. In 1795, during the French Revolution and the Li√®ge Revolution, the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy disappeared and was united with France. Malmedy was a lower prefecture in the \\"d√©partement de l'Ourthe\\". After the defeat of Napol√©on in 1815, during the Congress of Vienna, the decision was made to link Malmedy, a Romance and Walloon town, to Prussia, a Germanic state. This special situation of Malmedy caused a lot of problems in the first 50 years. However, the inhabitants were free to speak French as they pleased, including in the day-to-day running of the town council. This situation changed when Chancellor Bismarck took power following the Franco-German War of 1870. For the Prussian Administration, Malmedy suffered a double disadvantage as it was both francophone and the majority of the inhabitants were Catholic. From this moment, Malmedy was forced to be Germanised. In schools, lessons in French were banned and the German language was mandatory. The priests were not allowed to preach any longer in French. During the First World War, the population of Malmedy fought in German uniforms. But when the defeat of Prussia was proclaimed, Malmedy and the other eastern cantons were annexed to Belgium by virtue of the Treaty of Versailles. Malmedy and neighbouring Eupen were subject to a plebiscite to determine whether the region would be separated from Germany and annexed to Belgium. The plebiscite ballots required registration of the names and addresses of the pro-German voters (the others were assumed to be pro-Belgian), and the German-speaking population of Eupen and Malmedy were intimidated. Both were formally annexed on 6 March 1925. The main church of Malmedy was built in 1777 and served as a cathedral from 1920 to 1925.Jean Finot. New York Times, May 30, 1915. Some old sources spell the city's name \\"Malm√©dy\\" as this accent was intentionally added when being part of Prussia and Germany, but its official website lists it as \\"Malmedy\\", with no accent. Along with the neighbouring city of Eupen, it formed a German- speaking area of Belgium. This was reversed after the war. During this period, a few undaunted individuals went as far as founding a ‚ÄúWalloon Club‚Äù in 1897, and this still exists today. In 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge, the area was the site of the Malmedy massacre, where 84 American prisoners of war were executed by Nazi SS troops under the command of Joachim Peiper. This was one of a number of such massacres of prisoners and Belgian civilians which took place in the Malmedy area. Between 1940 and 1945, Malmedy was re-incorporated into Germany. On 21 December the town itself, which was then held by US troops, was attacked by German forces under the command of Otto Skorzeny, who were repelled. Moreover, on 23, 24 and 25 December 1944 the city was bombed repeatedly by the United States Army Air Forces in a series of friendly fire incidents. Approximately 200 civilians were killed in the tragic attacks, while the number of American casualties has never been revealed by the United States Department of Defense. Today, the people of Malmedy are a mix of Romance and German cultures. Despite all the changes, the Malmedians seem to have preserved the qualities recognised by an 18th-century English chemist when he stated, ‚ÄúThe inhabitants of Malmedy are honest, skillful, opulent, gracious, sociable and courteous towards foreigners.‚Äù Nowadays, the population consists of approximately 12,000 inhabitants, there are seven male choirs, two song groups, four brass bands, an accordion club, a mandolin club and a very active music academy. Climate Malmedy has an oceanic climate with continental influences due to its inland position and higher elevation. Winter can see ice days, strong air frosts and snowfall. Malmedy's high precipitation is commonly affecting the nearby Spa-Francorchamps race track, known for its treacherous weather conditions.  Folklore  Cwarm√™, Sunday. Hagu√®te and others traditional costumes. Inhabitants are proud of their Walloon language and their typical folklore. The people of Malmedy never miss the chance to celebrate a festival. The main celebrations in Malmedy are the ‚ÄúCwarm√™‚Äù (Carnival), the ‚ÄúSaint-Jean d‚Äô√©t√©‚Äù (Midsummer's Day), the ‚ÄúSaint-Pierre‚Äù (the annual funfair at Saint Peter's Day), the \\"Saint-G√©r√©on\\" (in Walloon ‚ÄúTribodl√®dje‚Äù) and the Saint Martin's day (‚ÄúEv√™uyes‚Äù). = Cwarm√™ = The \\"Cwarm√™\\", a Walloon word defining the Carnival of Malmedy, is the town's main festivity. Even though a part of the Malmedian culture is linked to the German culture, the \\"Cwarm√™\\" of Malmedy is actually a Walloon and Latin carnival. The celebration takes place from Shrove Friday to Shrove Tuesday, 40 days before Easter. The \\"Cwarm√™\\" Sunday is the most important day. For the tourist, it's the opportunity to see the old traditional costumes in the streets (2,500 people in costume). The \\"Cwarm√™\\" is depicted as a \\"street carnival\\" and is not only a parade: people who are disguised pass through the crowd and perform amongst them.

He uses his arms to catch a spectator's hat which he then puts on the head of another person. ** The \\"Long-N√©\\" consists of a group of eight people, each wearing a long-nose mask, a traditional blue smock and a long red & white cap. The group chooses a spectator in the crowd whom they follow and imitate until he offers them some beverages.

History The town and abbey of Stavelot, c. 1735 The town grew up around the Abbey of Stavelot, founded ca 650, out of what had been a villa, by Saint Remaclus (Saint Remacle). The villa's lands occupied the borderland between the bishoprics of Cologne and Tongeren. The Abbey of Stavelot was secularized and demolished at the time of the French Revolution: of the church just the west end doorway remains, as a free-standing tower. Two cloisters ‚Äî one secular, one for the monks ‚Äî survive as the courtyards of the brick-and- stone 17th-century domestic ranges, now housing the Museum of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy, and museums devoted to the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who was a long-term resident, and to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. The foundations of the abbey church are presented as a footprint, with walls and column bases that enable the visitor to visualize the scale of the Romanesque abbey. Abbot Wibald (ruled 1130‚Äì58) was one of the greatest patrons of the arts in the 12th century; the Stavelot Triptych of gilded copper and enamels, which contained two fragments of the True Cross, was produced for the Abbey during his rule (about 1156). The binding of the Stavelot Bible, and the remaining fragments from the retable (altar screen) at Stavelot are also high points of medieval art. In the 16th century, the monk Jean Delvaux claimed to have seen witches and demonic rituals, as he accused several other church officials of engaging in these rituals. Stavelot was the seat of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy, a small independent region of the Holy Roman Empire, ruled by the abbots of Stavelot. The principality was dissolved in 1795 during the French Revolution. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Stavelot was added to the Kingdom of the Netherlands while Malmedy was added to the Prussian Rhineland. In 1830 it became part of Belgium. (Malmedy would also become a part of Belgium, but not until 1919.) The town's coat of arms, granted in 1819, is parted fesswise between Stavelot's founding bishop, and the wolf which in Stavelot's founding legend carried bricks for the building of the Abbey.Coat of arms of Stavelot on Heraldry of the World During the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, the city was the scene of severe fighting.

The municipality of Verviers includes the old communes of Ensival, Lambermont, Petit-Rechain, Stembert, and Heusy. It is also the center of an agglomeration that includes Dison and Pepinster, making it the second biggest in the province and an important regional center, located roughly halfway between Li√®ge and the German border. Water has played an important role in the town's economy, notably in the development first of its textile and later its tourist industries. As a result, many fountains have been built in Verviers, leading it to be named Wallonia's \\"Water Capital\\". The seats of the two Walloon public institutions for water distribution and water treatment are located in the town.  History  = Early history = Various flint and bone fragments, as well as Roman coins, were found in this area, attesting to the early settlements in the region. In the 4th century, the Romans had to deal with a constant push of Germanic tribes coming from the east. Successful at first at containing them, they finally had to concede defeat, allowing Clovis's Salian Franks to occupy the region at the end of the 5th century. The Verviers area was covered with forests and became a hunting ground for the Merovingian kings, who maintained a vicus in neighbouring Theux. It was also slowly Christianized by the monks of the nearby Abbey of Stavelot. In the 10th century, Charles the Simple ceded the Marquisate of Franchimont to the prince- bishop of Li√®ge, just before the creation of the Prince-Bishopric. Li√®ge took direct control of the marquisate in 1014, an act which was confirmed by emperor Frederick Barbarossa and by Pope Adrian IV in 1155. = 15th century to the present = Film of US First Army headquarters with George Patton on 3 November 1944 in Verviers The first mention of a textile industry in this area dates from the 15th century. One century later, the cloth industry took the place of the older metallurgical works, thanks in part to the Eighty Years War raging in the neighbouring Netherlands. The size of the town, however, remained relatively modest. It was only in 1651 that the expansion of the fulleries led to Verviers being recognized as one of the prince-bishopric's bonnes villes (main cities). The end of the 18th century was troubled by the French Revolution. The annexation of Li√®ge to France in 1795 caused a steep economic decline and unprecedented poverty. The city's fortunes rose again after the Battle of Waterloo (1815). Verviers was at the eastern end of the sillon industriel, the industrial backbone of Wallonia. Industrialist William Cockerill used British know-how to start a new era in Verviers' textile industry. Roads were paved, gas lighting was installed, and the city doubled in size thanks to the Industrial Revolution. After World War I, Verviers could share with Bradford the title of \\"Wool Capital of the World\\".  Economy  Verviers was home to a thriving wool and textile industry that was renowned for its quality and contributed greatly to the growth of the town. However, as of the 1950s, the local factories could not face international competition and started closing one after the other which prompted the economic decline of the town. The economy has been slowly recovering since the mid-1990s but remains fragile. Several commercial complexes have opened in recent years in an attempt to revitalize the most affected areas.

He is a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner who is a weekly columnist for The New York Times. He has written extensively on foreign affairs, global trade, the Middle East, globalization, and environmental issues. He has been criticized for his staunch advocacy of the Iraq War and unregulated trade and his early support of Saudi Royal Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Background WEF 2013 Friedman was born on July 20, 1953, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Margaret Blanche (n√©e Phillips) and Harold Abe Friedman. Harold, who was vice president of a ball bearing company, United Bearing, died of a heart attack in 1973, when Tom was nineteen years old. Margaret, who served in the United States Navy during World War II and studied Home Economics at the University of Wisconsin, was a homemaker and a part-time bookkeeper. Margaret was also a Senior Life Master duplicate bridge player, and died in 2008. Friedman has two older sisters, Shelly and Jane. From an early age, Friedman, whose father often took him to the golf course for a round after work, wanted to be a professional golfer. He played a lot of sports, and became serious about tennis and golf. He caddied at a local country club and in 1970 caddied for professional golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez when the US Open came to town. Friedman is Jewish. He attended Hebrew school five days a week until his Bar Mitzvah,From Beirut to Jerusalem. 1990, page 4 then St. Louis Park High School, where he wrote articles for his school's newspaper. He became enamored with Israel after a visit there in December 1968, and he spent all three of his high school summers living on Kibbutz HaHotrim, near Haifa.From Beirut to Jerusalem. 1990, page 5 He has characterized his high school years as \\"one big celebration of Israel's victory in the Six-Day War.\\" Friedman studied at the University of Minnesota for two years, but later transferred to Brandeis University and graduated summa cum laude in 1975 with a degree in Mediterranean studies. Friedman did also pursue Arabic studies at The American University in Cairo, where he graduated in 1974 from its Arabic language unit (ALU). Friedman later taught a class in economics at Brandeis in 2006, and was a commencement speaker there in 2007. After graduating from Brandeis, he attended St Antony's College at the University of Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, earning an M.Phil. in Middle Eastern studies. Friedman's wife, Ann (n√©e Bucksbaum), a native of Marshalltown, Iowa,Iowa state University Plaza of Heroines: \\"Ann Bucksbaum Friedman\\" retrieved September 24, 2017 is a graduate of Stanford University and the London School of Economics. She is the daughter of real estate developer Matthew Bucksbaum, whom Friedman describes as his \\"best friend\\".Forbes: \\"Thomas Friedman is On Top of the World\\" by Garrett M. Graff July 1, 2006 They were married in London on Thanksgiving Day 1978 and live in an 11,400-square-foot mansion in Bethesda, Maryland. The couple has two daughters, Orly (b. 1985) and Natalie (b. 1988). Journalism career Friedman speaking at the Chatham House in London in September 2014 Friedman joined the London bureau of United Press International after completing his master's degree. He was dispatched a year later to Beirut, where he lived from June 1979 to May 1981 while covering the Lebanon Civil War. He was hired by The New York Times as a reporter in 1981 and re-dispatched to Beirut at the start of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. His coverage of the war, particularly the Sabra and Shatila massacre, won him the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting (shared with Loren Jenkins of The Washington Post). Alongside David K. Shipler he also won the George Polk Award for foreign reporting. In June 1984, Friedman was transferred to Jerusalem, where he served as the New York Times Jerusalem Bureau Chief until February 1988. That year he received a second Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting, which cited his coverage of the First Palestinian Intifada. He wrote a book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, describing his experiences in the Middle East, which won the 1989 U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction. Friedman covered Secretary of State James Baker during the administration of President George H. W. Bush. Following the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, Friedman became the White House correspondent for the New York Times. In 1994, he began to write more about foreign policy and economics, and moved to the op-ed page of The New York Times the following year as a foreign affairs columnist. In 2002, Friedman won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his \\"clarity of vision, based on extensive reporting, in commenting on the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat.\\" [(List of ten 2001 articles.)] In February 2002, Friedman met Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and encouraged him to make a comprehensive attempt to end the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict by normalizing Arab relations with Israel in exchange for the return of refugees alongside an end to the Israel territorial occupations. Abdullah proposed the Arab Peace Initiative at the Beirut Summit that March, which Friedman has since strongly supported. Friedman received the 2004 Overseas Press Club Award for lifetime achievement and the same year was named to the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. In May 2011, The New York Times reported that President Barack Obama \\"has sounded out\\" Friedman concerning Middle East issues. Views and opinions = Aadhaar = Friedman has publicly expressed his support for the biometrics based Unique Identification program of India. When asked about the privacy concerns raised by the UID program in India he said =Globalization= Friedman and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at the World Economic Forum in Davos, January 17, 2017 Friedman first discussed his views on globalization in the book The Lexus and the Olive Tree (1999). In 2004, visits to Bangalore, India, and Dalian, China, led Friedman to write a follow-up analysis, The World Is Flat (2005). The book was on the New York Times Best Seller list from its April 2005 publication until May 2007. Friedman believes that individual countries must sacrifice some degree of economic sovereignty to global institutions (such as capital markets and multinational corporations), a situation he has termed the \\"golden straitjacket\\". He has also expressed concern about the United States' lack of energy independence. He has stated, \\"First rule of oil‚Äîaddicts never tell the truth to their pushers. We are the addicts, the oil producers are the pushers‚Äîwe've never had an honest conversation with the Saudis.\\" In 2007, Friedman viewed American immigration laws as too restrictive and damaging to U.S. economic output: \\"It is pure idiocy that Congress will not open our borders‚Äîas wide as possible‚Äîto attract and keep the world's first-round intellectual draft choices in an age when everyone increasingly has the same innovation tools and the key differentiator is human talent.\\" After visiting the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego, California in early April 2019, Friedman wrote, \\"The whole day left me more certain than ever that we have a real immigration crisis and that the solution is a high wall with a big gate ‚Äî but a smart gate.\\" =Terrorism= After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Friedman's writing focused more on the threat of terrorism and the Middle East. He was awarded the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary \\"for his clarity of vision, based on extensive reporting, in commenting on the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat\\". These columns were collected and published in the book Longitudes and Attitudes. For a while, his reporting on post-9/11 topics led him to diverge from his prior interests in technological advances and globalization, until he began to research The World Is Flat. After the 7/7 London bombings, Friedman called for the U.S. State Department to \\"shine a spotlight on hate speech wherever it appears\\", and to create a quarterly \\"War of Ideas Report, which would focus on those religious leaders and writers who are inciting violence against others\\". Friedman said the governmental speech- monitoring should go beyond those who actually advocate violence, and include also those whom former State Department spokesperson Jamie Rubin calls \\"excuse makers\\". In his July 22 column, Friedman wrote against the \\"excuses\\" made by terrorists or apologists who blame their actions on third-party influences or pressures. \\"After every major terrorist incident, the excuse makers come out to tell us ... why the terrorists acted. These excuse makers are just one notch less despicable than the terrorists and also deserve to be exposed. When you live in an open society like London, where anyone with a grievance can publish an article, run for office or start a political movement, the notion that blowing up a busload of innocent civilians in response to Iraq is somehow \\"understandable\\" is outrageous. \\"It erases the distinction between legitimate dissent and terrorism\\" Mr. Rubin said, \\"and an open society needs to maintain a clear wall between them.\\" As part of their response to this column, the editors at FAIR encouraged their readers to contact Friedman and inform him that \\"opponents of the Iraq War do not deserve to be on a government blacklist-even if they oppose the war because they believe it encourages terrorism\\". =Kosovo War= During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Friedman wrote the following in The New York Times on April 23, 1999: \\"Like it or not, we are at war with the Serbian nation (the Serbs certainly think so), and the stakes have to be very clear: Every week you ravage Kosovo is another decade we will set your country back by pulverizing you. You want 1950? We can do 1950. You want 1389? We can do 1389 too.\\" Friedman urged the US to destroy \\"in Belgrade: every power grid, water pipe, bridge [and] road\\", annex Albania and Macedonia as \\"U.S. protectorates\\", \\"occupy the Balkans for years,\\" and \\"[g]ive war a chance.\\" Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) labeled Friedman's remarks \\"war-mongering\\" and \\"crude race-hatred and war-crime agitation\\". Steve Chapman, critical of the response taken by NATO, referred to Friedman as \\"the most fervent supporter of the air war\\" and ironically asked in the Chicago Tribune: \\"Why stop at 1389? Why not revive the idea, proposed but never adopted in Vietnam, of bombing the enemy all the way back to the Stone Age?\\" Norman Solomon asserted in 2007 that \\"a tone of sadism could be discerned\\" in Friedman's article. =Iraq= Friedman supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that the establishment of a democratic state in the Middle East would force other countries in the region to liberalize and modernize. In his February 9, 2003, column for The Wall Street Journal, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction: Since the invasion, Friedman has expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair for \\"hyping\\" the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy \\"would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq's fractious history\\". In January 2004, he participated in a forum on Slate called \\"Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War\\", in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq's lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions: In his September 29, 2005, column in The New York Times, Friedman entertained the idea of supporting the Kurds and Shias in a civil war against the Sunnis: \\"If they the Sunnis won't come around, we should arm the Shiites and Kurds and leave the Sunnis of Iraq to reap the wind.\\"The Endgame in Iraq Sep 29. 2005 Critics of Friedman's position on the Iraq War have noted his recurrent assertion that \\"the next six months\\" will prove critical in determining the outcome of the conflict. A May 2006 study by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting cited 14 examples of Friedman's declaring the next \\"few months\\" or \\"six months\\" as a decisive or critical period, dating from in November 2003, describing it as \\"a long series of similar do-or-die dates that never seem to get any closer\\".Tom Friedman's Flexible Deadlines: Iraq's 'decisive' six months have lasted two and a half years May 16, 2006 The blogger Atrios coined the neologism \\"Friedman Unit\\" to refer to this unit of time in relation to Iraq, noting its use as a supposedly critical window of opportunity. HuffPost cited it as the \\"Best New Phrase\\" of 2006. In a live television interview aired June 11, 2006, on CNN, Howard Kurtz asked Friedman about the concept: \\"Now, I want to understand how a columnist's mind works when you take positions, because you were chided recently for writing several times in different occasions 'the next six months are crucial in Iraq.'\\" Friedman responded: \\"The fact is that the outcome there is unclear, and I reflected that in my column. And I will continue to reflect.\\"White House Mounts Media Blitz After Killing of Zarqawi June 11, 2006 Responding to prodding from Stephen Colbert, Friedman said in 2007: \\"We've run out of six months. It's really time to set a deadline.\\" =Environment= Iran's Great Weakness May Be Its Oil, by Thomas Friedman, challenges and debates conflicts about oil. Friedman states,\\"The best tool we have for curbing Iran's influence is not containment or engagement, but getting the price of oil down in the long term with conservation and an alternative-energy strategy. Let's exploit Iran's oil addiction by ending ours\\". In Hot, Flat, and Crowded, he says that \\"any car company that gets taxpayer money must demonstrate a plan for transforming every vehicle in its fleet to a hybrid-electric engine with flex- fuel capability, so its entire fleet can also run on next generation cellulosic ethanol\\". In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman described his motivations for writing the book: \\"My concern is about America.... Demand for clean energy, clean fuel and energy efficiency is clearly going to explode; it's going to be the next great global industry. I know that as sure as I know that I'm sitting here at De Anza College talking to you. By being big in the next big thing, we'll be seen by the rest of the world as working on the most important problem in the world.\\" Some of Friedman's environmental critics question his support of still-undeveloped coal pollution mitigation technology (\\"clean coal\\") and coal mining as emblematic of Friedman's less than \\"green\\" commitment to renewable energy.The NYT's Thomas Friedman January 2007 While Friedman supports the elimination of coal-based power, he believes improving coal technology is necessary in the short term. =Israel= Friedman has been criticized by organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting for defending Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon as a form of \\"educating\\" Israel's opponents; according to FAIR, Friedman was explicitly endorsing terrorism by Israel against Lebanese and Palestinians. Journalist Glenn Greenwald and professor Noam Chomsky also accused Friedman of endorsing and encouraging terrorism by Israeli forces. Political reporter Belen Fernandez heavily critiques Friedman's commentary regarding Israel. Among other criticisms, Fernandez singles out Friedman's suggestion that Israeli forces were unaware that their allied Lebanese militias carried out the Sabra and Shatila massacre while under their guard, contradicting the assessments of other journalists and observers; his encouragement of strong-armed force by the Israeli army against Palestinians; and his opposition to settlements only on the grounds that they are counter-productive, rather than because they violate international law or cause suffering for Palestinians. Fernandez suggests that Friedman is most worried about successfully maintaining Israel's Jewish ethnocracy and actively opposing a \\"one-man, one-vote\\" system of democracy.Fernandez, Belen. The Imperial Messenger: Thomas Friedman at Work. Verso Books, 2011, p 99-107 Friedman has also come under criticism from supporters of Israel. In an op-ed, Yitzhak Benhorin criticized Friedman's alleged suggestion that Israel relinquish territory it had occupied in the 1967 Middle Eastern War. Friedman sparked criticism for writing that congressional ovations for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were \\"bought and paid for by the Israel lobby.\\"Thomas L. Friedman: Newt, Mitt, Bibi and Vladimir New York Times 13 December 2011. A letter from the American Jewish Committee objected that \\"Public opinion polls consistently show a high level of American ... support for and identification with Israel. This indicates that the people's elected representatives are fully reflecting the will of the voters.\\"New York Times Columnist Tom Friedman Crossed a Line Jerusalem Post, 19 December 2011. Friedman responded to criticism by writing: \\"In retrospect I probably should have used a more precise term like 'engineered' by the Israel lobby ‚Äì a term that does not suggest grand conspiracy theories that I don't subscribe to.\\"Friedman responds to criticism over ‚Äòbought and paid for‚Äô jab at Congress JTA, December 20, 2011. Friedman hailed the historic, Trump-brokered peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates as \\"exactly what Trump said it was in his tweet: a 'HUGE breakthrough. =China= In September 2009, Friedman wrote an article praising China's one-party autocracy, saying that it was \\"led by a reasonably enlightened group of people\\" and that China's leaders are \\"boosting gasoline prices\\" and \\"overtaking us in electric cars, solar power, energy efficiency, batteries, nuclear power and wind power.\\" The article was in turn subject to critical analysis: Matt Lewis who wrote, \\"Friedman's apparent wish for a 'benign' dictator is utopian, inasmuch as it ignores Lord Acton's warning that 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.'\\" and William Easterly who quotes Friedman's one-party autocracy assertions as part of his academic paper in which he concluded that, \\"Formal theory and evidence provides little or no basis on which to believe the benevolent autocrat story\\" and that, \\"economists should retain their traditional skepticism for stories that have little good theory or empirics to support them.\\" However, in a July 2012 article in the NYT, he also wrote that the current Chinese leadership has not used its surging economic growth to also introduce gradual political reform and that, \\"Corruption is as bad as ever, institutionalized transparency and rule of law remain weak and consensual politics nonexistent.\\" When asked if he had \\"China envy\\" during a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman replied, \\"You detect the envy of someone who wants his own government to act democratically with the same effectiveness that China can do autocratically.\\" Likewise, in a 2011 interview with the BBC Friedman says that he wants his children to live in a world where \\"there's a strong America counterbalancing a strong and thriving China, and not one where you have a strong and rising China and an America that is uncertain, weak and unable to project power economically and militarily it historically did.\\" Friedman's work is popular in China. His book The World is Flat was a bestseller in the country, although criticism of China in the book was removed when it was published in the country. A translated version of his article from The New York Times, \\"China Needs Its Own Dream\\", has been credited with popularizing the phrase \\"Chinese Dream\\" in China, a term that was later adopted as a slogan by Xi Jinping. Friedman, in the magazine Foreign Policy, has attributed the phrase to Peggy Liu and her environmental NGO JUCCCE. In September 2020, Friedman told CNBC that \\"Trump is not the American president America deserves, in my opinion. But he definitely is the American president China deserved. We needed to have a president who was going to call the game with China. And Trump has done it, with I would say more grit and toughness than any of his predecessors. I give him credit for that.\\" =Iran= As the Iran nuclear deal agreement reached between Iran and a group of world powers (the P5+1). In Friedman's interview, he mentioned that \\"Our view of the Middle East is deeply colored by Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and they all have their own interest. 15 of the 19 hijackers on 911 were from Saudi Arabia, none from Iran! Iranians had a spontaneous demonstration to support Americans on 911.\\" He added, \\"What strikes you most about Iran (vs. Saudi Arabia) is that Iran has real politics... A country of 85 million people, a great civilization, many educated men and women, if they want to get a bomb WILL get it. They have demonstrated they could do it under the most severe sanctions... Show me where Iranians have acted reckless [like Saddam Hussein]. These are survivors.\\" =Radical centrism= In the 2010s, Friedman wrote several columns supporting the politics of radical centrism. In one he stated that, if the \\"radical center wants to be empowered, it can't just whine. It needs its own grass-roots movement\\".Friedman, Thomas L. (20 March 2010). \\"A Tea Party Without Nuts\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 25 February 2013. In another column Friedman promoted Americans Elect, an organization trying to field a radical-centrist candidate for the 2012 U.S. presidential election. That column decried \\"the two-party duopoly that has dominated American political life\\".Friedman, Thomas (23 July 2011). \\"Make Way for the Radical Center \\". The New York Times. Retrieved 23 February 2013. Friedman's radical-centrist columns received a considerable amount of criticism, particularly from liberals.Marx, Greg (25 July 2011). \\"Tom Friedman's 'Radical' Wrongness \\". Columbia Journalism Review. Retrieved 28 February 2013. Criticism American journalist and former civil rights litigator Glenn Greenwald, writing for Salon on July 25, 2012, commented: \\"His status among American elites is the single most potent fact for understanding the nation's imperial decline.\\" John Esposito criticized him in 2014 for writing twice that Muslims do not speak up against terrorism, and yet \\"his own newspaper has had these denunciations [by Muslims].\\" Some critics have derided Friedman's idiosyncratic prose style, with its tendency to use mixed metaphors and analogies. Walter Russell Mead described his prose as being \\"an occasionally flat Midwestern demotic punctuated by gee-whiz exclamations about just how doggone irresistible globalization is ‚Äì lacks the steely elegance of a Lippmann, the unobtrusive serviceability of a Scotty Reston or the restless fireworks of a Maureen Dowd and is best taken in small doses.\\" Similarly, journalist Matt Taibbi has said of Friedman's writing that, \\"Friedman came up with lines so hilarious you couldn't make them up even if you were trying ‚Äì and when you tried to actually picture the 'illustrative' figures of speech he offered to explain himself, what you often ended up with was pure physical comedy of the Buster Keaton/Three Stooges school, with whole nations and peoples slipping and falling on the misplaced banana peels of his literary endeavors.\\" In a column for the New York Press, Alexander Cockburn wrote: \\"Friedman exhibits on a weekly basis one of the severest cases known to science of Lippmann's condition, named for the legendary journalistic hot-air salesman, Walter Lippmann, and alluding to the inherent tendency of all pundits to swell in self-importance to zeppelin-like dimensions\\". Cockburn said Friedman's hubris allowed him to pass off another war correspondent's experience in Beirut as his own. In December, 2017, Hamid Dabashi wrote about Friedman: \\"Thomas Friedman is an ignorant fool - and I do not mean that as an insult. I mean it as a clinical diagnosis of an almost-illiterate man who has been cheated out of a proper undergraduate education, sold as a liberal Zionist to the highest bidder, and thus has managed to ramble and blabber his way up as a top-notch New York Times columnist.\\" In April 2018, Barrett Brown criticized Friedman for \\"his serial habit of giving the benefit of the doubt to whoever happens to hold power\\", such as Friedman's column supporting Vladimir Putin as a modernizing reformer, in which he urged Americans to \\"keep rootin' for Putin\\". Brown also used this phrase in the title of his 2014 book \\"Keep Rootin' for Putin: Establishment Pundits and the Twilight of American Competence\\". Documentaries Friedman has hosted several documentaries for the Discovery Channel from several locations around the world. In Straddling the Fence (2003), he visited the West Bank and spoke to Israelis and Palestinians about the Israeli West Bank barrier and its impact on their lives. Also in 2003, Thomas L. Friedman Reporting: Searching for the Roots of 9/11 aired on the Discovery Times Channel. This program investigated how the Sept. 11th attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and the Pentagon were viewed in the Muslim world. In The Other Side of Outsourcing (2004), he visited a call centre in Bangalore, interviewing the young Indians working there, and then travelled to an impoverished rural part of India, where he debated the pros and cons of globalization with locals (this trip spawned his later book The World is Flat). In Does Europe Hate Us? (2005), Friedman travelled through Britain, France and Germany, talking with academics, journalists, Marshall and Rhodes scholars, young Muslims and others about the nature of the strained relationship between Europe and the United States. Addicted to Oil (2006) premiered at the Silverdocs Documentary Festival at 5:30 PM on June 16, 2006, and aired on June 24, 2006, on the Discovery Times Channel. In it he examined the geopolitical, economic, and environmental consequences of petroleum use and ways that green technologies such as alternative fuels and energy efficiency and conservation can reduce oil dependence. In Green: The New Red, White and Blue (2007), Friedman elaborates on the green technologies and efforts touched on in Addicted to Oil and in doing so, attempts to redefine green energy as geostrategic, geoeconomic, capitalistic and patriotic. He explores efforts by companies and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint and save money with conservation, efficiency, and technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, and clean coal. In 2014, Friedman served as a correspondent for Years of Living Dangerously, a documentary show about climate change. For the show's first season, he traveled to cover the role climate change has played in conflicts in the region. He also interviewed U.S. President Barack Obama. For the show's second season in 2016, he traveled to Africa. Personal life Friedman is married to Ann Bucksbaum, a teacher and daughter of the founder of a shopping mall empire, Matthew Bucksbaum. He was one of the founding members of Kol Shalom, a synagogue in Rockville, Maryland. Friedman supported Hillary Clinton for President of the United States in the 2016 election, and supported Michael Bloomberg in the 2020 primaries. He supported Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election. Friedman is on the board of directors for Planet Word, a Washington, D.C. based private museum dedicated to language that is anticipated to open in May, 2020.

Flory, Principles of Polymer Chemistry, Cornell University Press, 1953. .Pierre Gilles De Gennes, Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics CORNELL UNIVERSITY PRESS Ithaca and London, 1979M. Doi and S. F. Edwards, The Theory of Polymer Dynamics Oxford University Inc NY, 1986Michael Rubinstein and Ralph H. Colby, Polymer Physics Oxford University Press, 2003 While it focuses on the perspective of condensed matter physics, polymer physics is originally a branch of statistical physics. Polymer physics and polymer chemistry are also related with the field of polymer science, where this is considered the applicative part of polymers. Polymers are large molecules and thus are very complicated for solving using a deterministic method. Yet, statistical approaches can yield results and are often pertinent, since large polymers (i.e., polymers with many monomers) are describable efficiently in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many monomers (although the actual size is clearly finite). Thermal fluctuations continuously affect the shape of polymers in liquid solutions, and modeling their effect requires using principles from statistical mechanics and dynamics. As a corollary, temperature strongly affects the physical behavior of polymers in solution, causing phase transitions, melts, and so on. The statistical approach for polymer physics is based on an analogy between a polymer and either a Brownian motion, or other type of a random walk, the self-avoiding walk. The simplest possible polymer model is presented by the ideal chain, corresponding to a simple random walk. Experimental approaches for characterizing polymers are also common, using polymer characterization methods, such as size exclusion chromatography, viscometry, dynamic light scattering, and Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP)US patent 6052184 and US Patent 6653150, other patents pendingF.

These experimental methods also helped the mathematical modeling of polymers and even for a better understanding of the properties of polymers. * Flory is considered the first scientist establishing the field of polymer physics. * French scientists contributed a lot since the 70s (e.g. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, J. des Cloizeaux). * Doi and Edwards wrote a very famous book in polymer physics. * Russian and Soviet schools of physics (I. M. Lifshitz, A. Yu. Grosberg, A.R. Khokhlov ) have been very active in the development of polymer physics.Vladimir Pokrovski, The Mesoscopic Theory of Polymer Dynamics, Springer, 2010A. Yu. Grosberg, A.R. Khokhlov. Statistical Physics of Macromolecules, 1994, American Institute o Physics Models Models of polymer chains are split into two types: \\"ideal\\" models, and \\"real\\" models. Ideal chain models assume that there are no interactions between chain monomers. This assumption is valid for certain polymeric systems, where the positive and negative interactions between the monomer effectively cancel out. Ideal chain models provide a good starting point for investigation of more complex systems and are better suited for equations with more parameters. =Ideal chains= * The freely-jointed chain is the simplest model of a polymer. In this model, fixed length polymer segments are linearly connected, and all bond and torsion angles are equiprobable.H. Yamakawa, \\"Helical Wormlike Chains in Polymer Solution\\", (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1997) The polymer can therefore be described by a simple random walk and ideal chain. * The freely-rotating chain improves the freely-jointed chain model by taking into account that polymer segments make a fixed bond angle to neighbouring units because of specific chemical bonding. Under this fixed angle, the segments are still free to rotate and all torsion angles are equally likely. * The hindered rotation model assumes that the torsion angle is hindered by a potential energy. This makes the probability of each torsion angle proportional to a Boltzmann factor: :P(\\\\theta)\\\\propto{}\\\\exp\\\\left(-U(\\\\theta)/kT\\\\right), where U(\\\\theta) is the potential determining the probability of each value of \\\\theta. * In the rotational isomeric state model, the allowed torsion angles are determined by the positions of the minima in the rotational potential energy. Bond lengths and bond angles are constant. * The Worm-like chain is a more complex model. It takes the persistence length into account. Polymers are not completely flexible; bending them requires energy. At the length scale below persistence length, the polymer behaves more or less like a rigid rod. =Real chains= Interactions between chain monomers can be modelled as excluded volume. This causes a reduction in the conformational possibilities of the chain, and leads to a self-avoiding random walk. Self-avoiding random walks have different statistics to simple random walks. Solvent and temperature effect The statistics of a single polymer chain depends upon the solubility of the polymer in the solvent. For a solvent in which the polymer is very soluble (a \\"good\\" solvent), the chain is more expanded, while for a solvent in which the polymer is insoluble or barely soluble (a \\"bad\\" solvent), the chain segments stay close to each other. In the limit of a very bad solvent the polymer chain merely collapses to form a hard sphere, while in a good solvent the chain swells in order to maximize the number of polymer-fluid contacts. For this case the radius of gyration is approximated using Flory's mean field approach which yields a scaling for the radius of gyration of: ::R_g \\\\sim N^ u, where R_g is the radius of gyration of the polymer, N is the number of bond segments (equal to the degree of polymerization) of the chain and u is the Flory exponent. For good solvent, u\\\\approx3/5; for poor solvent, u=1/3. Therefore, polymer in good solvent has larger size and behaves like a fractal object. In bad solvent it behaves like a solid sphere. In the so-called \\\\theta solvent, u=1/2, which is the result of simple random walk. The chain behaves as if it were an ideal chain. The quality of solvent depends also on temperature. For a flexible polymer, low temperature may correspond to poor quality and high temperature makes the same solvent good. At a particular temperature called theta (Œ∏) temperature, the solvent behaves as if an ideal chain. Excluded volume interaction The ideal chain model assumes that polymer segments can overlap with each other as if the chain were a phantom chain. In reality, two segments cannot occupy the same space at the same time. This interaction between segments is called the excluded volume interaction. The simplest formulation of excluded volume is the self-avoiding random walk, a random walk that cannot repeat its previous path. A path of this walk of N steps in three dimensions represents a conformation of a polymer with excluded volume interaction. Because of the self-avoiding nature of this model, the number of possible conformations is significantly reduced. The radius of gyration is generally larger than that of the ideal chain. Flexibility and reptation Whether a polymer is flexible or not depends on the scale of interest. For example, the persistence length of double-stranded DNA is about 50 nm. Looking at length scale smaller than 50 nm (Known as the McGuinness limit), it behaves more or less like a rigid rod.G.McGuinness, Polymer Physics, Oxford University Press, p347 At length scale much larger than 50 nm, it behaves like a flexible chain. Reptation is the thermal motion of very long linear, entangled macromolecules in polymer melts or concentrated polymer solutions. Derived from the word reptile, reptation suggests the movement of entangled polymer chains as being analogous to snakes slithering through one another. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes introduced (and named) the concept of reptation into polymer physics in 1971 to explain the dependence of the mobility of a macromolecule on its length. Reptation is used as a mechanism to explain viscous flow in an amorphous polymer. Sir Sam Edwards and Masao Doi later refined reptation theory. The consistent theory of thermal motion of polymers was given be Vladimir Pokrovskii . Similar phenomena also occur in proteins. Example model (simple random-walk, freely jointed) The study of long chain polymers has been a source of problems within the realms of statistical mechanics since about the 1950s. One of the reasons however that scientists were interested in their study is that the equations governing the behavior of a polymer chain were independent of the chain chemistry. What is more, the governing equation turns out to be a random walk, or diffusive walk, in space. Indeed, the Schr√∂dinger equation is itself a diffusion equation in imaginary time, t' = it. =Random walks in time= The first example of a random walk is one in space, whereby a particle undergoes a random motion due to external forces in its surrounding medium. A typical example would be a pollen grain in a beaker of water. If one could somehow \\"dye\\" the path the pollen grain has taken, the path observed is defined as a random walk. Consider a toy problem, of a train moving along a 1D track in the x-direction. Suppose that the train moves either a distance of +b or ‚àíb (b is the same for each step), depending on whether a coin lands heads or tails when flipped. Lets start by considering the statistics of the steps the toy train takes (where Si is the ith step taken): :\\\\langle S_{i} \\\\rangle = 0 ; due to a priori equal probabilities :\\\\langle S_{i} S_{j} \\\\rangle = b^2 \\\\delta_{ij}. The second quantity is known as the correlation function. The delta is the kronecker delta which tells us that if the indices i and j are different, then the result is 0, but if i = j then the kronecker delta is 1, so the correlation function returns a value of b2. This makes sense, because if i = j then we are considering the same step. Rather trivially then it can be shown that the average displacement of the train on the x-axis is 0; :x = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i :\\\\langle x \\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\sum_{i=1}^N S_i \\\\right\\\\rangle :\\\\langle x \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\langle S_i \\\\rangle. As stated \\\\langle S_i \\\\rangle = 0, so the sum is still 0. It can also be shown, using the same method demonstrated above, to calculate the root mean square value of problem. The result of this calculation is given below :x_\\\\mathrm{rms} = \\\\sqrt {\\\\langle x^2 \\\\rangle} = b \\\\sqrt N. From the diffusion equation it can be shown that the distance a diffusing particle moves in a medium is proportional to the root of the time the system has been diffusing for, where the proportionality constant is the root of the diffusion constant. The above relation, although cosmetically different reveals similar physics, where N is simply the number of steps moved (is loosely connected with time) and b is the characteristic step length. As a consequence we can consider diffusion as a random walk process. =Random walks in space= Random walks in space can be thought of as snapshots of the path taken by a random walker in time. One such example is the spatial configuration of long chain polymers. There are two types of random walk in space: self-avoiding random walks, where the links of the polymer chain interact and do not overlap in space, and pure random walks, where the links of the polymer chain are non-interacting and links are free to lie on top of one another. The former type is most applicable to physical systems, but their solutions are harder to get at from first principles. By considering a freely jointed, non-interacting polymer chain, the end-to-end vector is :\\\\mathbf{R} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\mathbf r_i where ri is the vector position of the i-th link in the chain. As a result of the central limit theorem, if N ‚â´ 1 then we expect a Gaussian distribution for the end-to-end vector. We can also make statements of the statistics of the links themselves; * \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{r}_{i} \\\\rangle = 0 ; by the isotropy of space * \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{r}_{i} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}_{j} \\\\rangle = 3 b^2 \\\\delta_{ij} ; all the links in the chain are uncorrelated with one another Using the statistics of the individual links, it is easily shown that :\\\\langle \\\\mathbf R \\\\rangle = 0 :\\\\langle \\\\mathbf R \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf R \\\\rangle = 3Nb^2. Notice this last result is the same as that found for random walks in time. Assuming, as stated, that that distribution of end-to-end vectors for a very large number of identical polymer chains is gaussian, the probability distribution has the following form :P = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left (\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi N b^2}{3} \\\\right )^{3/2}} \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\frac {- 3\\\\mathbf R \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf R}{2Nb^2}\\\\right). What use is this to us? Recall that according to the principle of equally likely a priori probabilities, the number of microstates, Œ©, at some physical value is directly proportional to the probability distribution at that physical value, viz; :\\\\Omega \\\\left ( \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\right ) = c P\\\\left ( \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\right ) where c is an arbitrary proportionality constant. Given our distribution function, there is a maxima corresponding to R = 0. Physically this amounts to there being more microstates which have an end-to-end vector of 0 than any other microstate. Now by considering :S \\\\left ( \\\\mathbf {R} \\\\right ) = k_B \\\\ln \\\\Omega {\\\\left ( \\\\mathbf R \\\\right) } :\\\\Delta S \\\\left( \\\\mathbf {R} \\\\right ) = S \\\\left( \\\\mathbf {R} \\\\right ) - S \\\\left (0 \\\\right ) :\\\\Delta F = - T \\\\Delta S \\\\left ( \\\\mathbf {R} \\\\right ) where F is the Helmholtz free energy, and it can be shown that :\\\\Delta F = k_B T \\\\frac {3R^2}{2Nb^2} = \\\\frac {1}{2} K R^2 \\\\quad ; K = \\\\frac {3 k_B T}{Nb^2}. which has the same form as the potential energy of a spring, obeying Hooke's law. This result is known as the entropic spring result and amounts to saying that upon stretching a polymer chain you are doing work on the system to drag it away from its (preferred) equilibrium state. An example of this is a common elastic band, composed of long chain (rubber) polymers. By stretching the elastic band you are doing work on the system and the band behaves like a conventional spring, except that unlike the case with a metal spring, all of the work done appears immediately as thermal energy, much as in the thermodynamically similar case of compressing an ideal gas in a piston. It might at first be astonishing that the work done in stretching the polymer chain can be related entirely to the change in entropy of the system as a result of the stretching. However, this is typical of systems that do not store any energy as potential energy, such as ideal gases. That such systems are entirely driven by entropy changes at a given temperature, can be seen whenever it is the case that are allowed to do work on the surroundings (such as when an elastic band does work on the environment by contracting, or an ideal gas does work on the environment by expanding). Because the free energy change in such cases derives entirely from entropy change rather than internal (potential) energy conversion, in both cases the work done can be drawn entirely from thermal energy in the polymer, with 100% efficiency of conversion of thermal energy to work. In both the ideal gas and the polymer, this is made possible by a material entropy increase from contraction that makes up for the loss of entropy from absorption of the thermal energy, and cooling of the material.

The city is located on the River Geer (), in the loessic Haspengouw region. The economy is based on the cultivation of cereals and sugar beet, and on the food industry. The municipality of Waremme includes the following villages: Bettincourt (), Bleret, Bovenistier, Grand-Axhe, Lantermange, and Oleye (). History Several findings were unearthed near Waremme containing remnants of Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements. The main Roman road linking Bavai to Cologne passed right through the territory. Tumuli and Roman villas were found nearby. Romans have also left a horse burial. The medieval hamlet of Woromia was cited for the first time in 965. On February 5, 1078, Woromia was ceded to the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, together with its castle, five mills, and six breweries.150px By 1215, with its 815 inhabitants, it had grown to town size. Its frontier position near the Duchy of Brabant, however, attracted several raids from the duke, causing it to be burnt to the ground and rebuilt at least a couple of times. In the 14th century, the town built a market place and a hospital, slowly becoming an important regional center, where coins were issued and important meetings held. During his conquest of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, Charles the Bold burnt the city once more in 1468. In the 16th century, the town became one of the 21 bonnes villes (main cities) of the prince-bishopric. In 1748, a quarter of the city was again destroyed by fire, this time accidentally. In 1792, the French Revolutionary troops entered the city and closed the convents. Three years later, the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge was dissolved and the city became French. The 19th century was prosperous, thanks to the advent of the railways linking Mechelen to Ans, and the construction of two sugar refineries and several schools. In 1904, Guillaume Mo√´s established his engine and locomotive company Ateliers Mo√´s-Freres in Waremme; they continued manufacturing in the town until October 2013. World War I did not bring any destruction to the city, except for that of the old surrounding walls. World War II, however, was a lot worse as half of the city was destroyed by air raids, only days before Liberation Day. The city then counted about 5,000 inhabitants.

With a population of just over 28,000, it is the smallest provincial capital in Belgium. Arlon is also the capital of its cultural region: the Arelerland (Land of Arlon in Luxemburgish). The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Arlon proper, Autelbas-Barnich, Bonnert, Guirsch, Heinsch, and Toernich. Other population centers include: * Autelhaut * Clairefontaine * Fouches * Frassem * Freylange * Heckbous * Rosenberg * Sampont * Schoppach * Sesselich * Seymerich * Stehnen * Sterpenich * Stockem * Udange * Viville * Waltzing * Weyler * Wolberg History =Roman and medieval times= Before the Roman conquests of Gaul, the territory of Arlon and a vast area to the southeast were settled by the Treveri, a Celtic tribe. The local population adapted relatively easily to Roman culture. The number and quality of sculpted stones and monuments that have been unearthed in the area demonstrate that the vicus of Orolaunum quickly became a vibrant commercial and administrative centre of Roman civilization. The Germanic invasions of the 3rd century destroyed most of these early advances, despite the defensive walls that had been built on the Knipchen hill to protect the vicus. During most of the Middle Ages, the population still used the earlier buildings such as the thermae. In 1060, Waleran I of Limburg, Count of Arlon, built a castle on the Knipchen hill. In the 13th century, the only women's Cistercian abbey known to date was built in Clairefontaine. =15th century until the French Revolution= The Duchy of Luxembourg itself, of which Arlon was dependent, became part of the Burgundian Netherlands under Philip the Good in 1441. After Charles V's abdication of his empire to his son Philip II of Spain in 1556, a troubled period started for the whole region with continuous wars involving France, Spain and the Southern Netherlands. In 1558, nearly half of the city, including its castle, was destroyed by the French troops of Duke Fran√ßois of Guise. In the 17th century, Capuchin friars built a convent on the ruins of the castle and the French strengthened the defensive walls according to Vauban's designs. An accidental fire destroyed a large part of the city again in 1785. St Donat's church, Arlon =Modern times= On 9 June 1793 the French Revolutionary troops opposed the Austrians just outside Arlon. The French emerged victorious and occupied the city. They expelled the Capuchin friars and used their convent as a hospital. After the Battle of Waterloo, Arlon's history is entwined with that of Belgium. Arlon was one of the first victims of the German invasion in 1914 as 121 inhabitants were executed on 26 August, on the orders of Colonel Richard Karl von Tessmar. Its territory was again among the first to be invaded at the onset of World War II. During the war, the mayor of Arlon, Paul Reuter collaborated with the occupying Germans. He was shot in 1946. Arlon today Being situated very close to the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Arlon has continued to expand with new residential areas and commercial development zones, and many people cross the border everyday to work in the Grand Duchy. One of the largest industrial employers is the Ferrero Rocher chocolate factory. All International express trains make a stop in Arlon, as it is the last station on the main Brussels--Luxembourg City railway line. Sights The Jewish cemetery *Arlon is best known for holding one of the richest archeological museums in Belgium. It houses numerous examples of Roman sculpture and Merovingian funerary art. *A fragment of the Gallo-Roman defensive wall that was built in the 3rd century still stands in Arlon. *The Gaspar Museum is well known for its furniture, paintings, ceramics, and religious art. *Saint Donat's church now stands on the Knipchen hill, where Waleran I of Limburg once built his castle and the Capuchin friars built their convent. * Arlon cemetery has the largest Jewish section of all Walloon cemeteries. * A statue commemorating the Atrocities in the Congo Free State of Leopold II is found in the town. Local customs * The carnival of Arlon takes place at mid-Lent. It includes the traditional handing of the city keys to the carnival prince and a colourful parade composed of various folk dance groups. * The Maitrank (German for \\"drink of May\\") is the city's most popular refreshment. It is made of white wine in which a local flower, the Asperula odorata, has macerated. Some recipes also add cognac or substitute woodruff for the Asperula. The Maitrank festivities take place in the city every fourth Sunday of May.

The municipality of Bastogne includes the old communes of Longvilly, Noville, Villers-la-Bonne-Eau, and Wardin. The town is situated on a ridge in the Ardennes at an elevation of . History At the time of the Roman conquest the region of Bastogne was inhabited by the Treveri, a tribe of Gauls. A form of the name Bastogne was first mentioned only much later, in 634, when the local lord ceded these territories to the St Maximin's Abbey, near Trier. A century later, the Bastogne area went to the nearby Pr√ºm Abbey. The town of Bastogne and its marketplace are again mentioned in an 887 document. By the 13th century, Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and count of Luxemburg, was minting coins in Bastogne. In 1332, John the Blind, his son, granted the city its charter and had it encircled by defensive walls, part of which, the current Porte de Tr√®ves, still exists. In 1451, the lands of the county of Luxemburg were absorbed into the Duchy of Burgundy and as a result, Bastogne became part of the lands of the Spanish Crown when the Burgundian heir Charles became king of Spain in 1516. The city's walls were quite effective at protecting it during the troubled times that followed. The city's economy actually flourished thanks to the renown of its agricultural and cattle fairs. The walls repelled a Dutch attack successfully in 1602. In 1688, they were dismantled by order of King Louis XIV when the town was occupied by French forces during the Nine Years War. The 19th century and Belgium's independence were favourable to Bastogne, as its forest products and cattle fairs became better known abroad. Several railway lines were built to link it to the neighbouring towns. This all came to an end with the German occupation during World War I. =World War II= Liberated by the Allies on 10th September 1944, Bastogne was attacked by German forces a few months later. Hitler's plan was to regain control of the Ardennes, splitting British from American forces, then advance to and reoccupy the strategic port of Antwerp and cut off the key Allied supply line. On 16 December, taking advantage of cold and fog, German artillery initiated the Battle of the Bulge attacking the American divisions deployed sparsely around Bastogne. A few days later, Brigadier General McAuliffe and the 101st Airborne Division along with elements of the 10th Armored Division (United States) and the 82nd Airborne Division, arrived to counter-attack but, after heavy fighting, became encircled within the town. On 22 December German emissaries asked for the American surrender, to which the General answered tersely, ‚ÄúNuts!‚Äù The next day the skies cleared, allowing Allied air forces to retaliate and to drop much needed food, medicine, and weaponry to ground forces. On 26 December the Third U.S. Army, under the command of General Patton, arrived and broke the siege. The official end of the Battle of Bastogne occurred three weeks later, when all fighting in the area ceased. Bastogne is the terminus of the Liberty Road, the commemorative way that marks the path of liberating Allied forces, and of the Third Army that subsequently relieved Bastogne.  Geography  Bastogne is located in the Belgian Ardennes, in the east of the province of Luxembourg,. The city is away from the Luxembourg border. Its altitude is high on the ridge line separating the catchment areas of the Rhine and Meuse. It is the 9th largest municipality in Belgium and the third largest in the province (after Libramont-Chevigny and L√©glise). In terms of population, it is the 4th largest municipality in the province after Arlon, Marche-en-Famenne and Aubange. The 50th degree of north latitude crosses the city. The municipality of Bastogne comprises five sections (Bastogne proper, Longvilly, Noville, Villers-la-Bonne-Eau, and Wardin) which were separate municipalities before a merger in 1977. Each contains a number of villages. * Bastogne: Bizory, Chifontaine, Hemroulle, Isle-la-Hesse, Isle-le-Pr√©, Savy, Senonchamps ; * Longvilly: Al-Hez, Arloncourt, Bourcy, Horritine, Michamps, Moinet, Oubourcy ; * Noville: Cobru, Fagnoux, Foy, Hardigny, Luzery, Rachamps, Recogne, Vaux, Wicourt ; * Villers- la-Bonne-Eau: Livarchamps, Losange, Lutrebois, Lutremange, Remoifosse ; * Wardin: Benonchamps, Bras, Harzy, Mageret, Marenwez, Marvie, Mont, Neffe.  Climate  Bastogne has an oceanic climate similar to the remainder of Belgium, but with more continental influences due to it being inland and elevated in comparison to lowland areas nearer the Atlantic. In spite of this the winters are heavily moderated for its latitude and although snowfall and frosts are common, means remain just above freezing.

Transportation Bastogne originally had an NMBS/SNCB railway line connecting it to Libramont and to Gouvy. Passenger trains to Gouvy stopped in 1984 √âtudes et Documentation Ferroviaires - rail.lu and in the 1990s the line to Libramont was taken out of service.Belgian Line News 1995Belgian Branch Line News 2000 The two station buildings in Bastogne remain, but are now used for other purposes. Part of the rail line has been converted into a cycle path. However, two bus stations are now open in Bastogne, according to SNCB: Bastogne Nord and Bastogne Sud. The short line that runs is only a rural shuttle line from Bastogne Nord to Libramont stopping only at Bastogne Sud.

The town is part of the Arrondissement of Bastogne. It is the place of origin of the House of Salm. On 1 January 2007 the municipality had 7,339 inhabitants. The total area is 139.76 km2, giving a population density of 52.5 inhabitants per km2. Etymology The village, like Salmch√¢teau, takes its name from the River Salm. The region is also called the Val de Salm, and Salm region. The word \\"Salm\\" comes from the Celtic salwa, meaning black or blurred. Vielsalm means literally \\"Old Salm\\" because, at some point, the Lord moved his castle which became the new town centre. A different popular etymology says Salm and Vielsam are taken from the German Salm, meaning salmon. The arms of the ancient house of Salm and those of the town are based on this interpretation. Geography Vielsalm is located in the Ardennes mountain range and the highest point within the municipal boundary is the Baraque de Fraiture, high and is the third highest peak of Belgium. The town is surrounded by forests and farmland. In the centre is a large lake. The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Vielsalm proper, Bihain, Grand-Halleux, and Petit-Thier. Other population centers include Commanster, Fraiture, Farni√®res, H√©bronval, Ottr√©, Prov√®droux, Jubi√©val, R√®gn√©, Rencheux, Ville-du-Bois, Petit-Halleux and Salmch√¢teau. The town is situated between two main motorways, the E25 (N30) from Liege to Bastogne and the E42 (N62) at St. Vith which leads to Bitburg just across the border in Germany. History The modern municipality is the product of the merger of the former municipalities of Vielsalm, Grand Halleux, Petit Thier and Bihain along with some parts of Lierneux, Beho Arbrefontaine. There is evidence of habitation from neolithic times in the form of stone polishers. There is a Celtic enclosure and traces of gold mining. There are some evidence of a Middle Age castle near the church in Vielsalm, and the remains of a 14th- century castle near Salmch√¢teau consisting of two towers with a narrow entrance. In World War II, the 75th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army, 575th Signal Co., maintained its command post in the town from January 19‚Äì22, 1945, as it counterattacked against the German army. Economy The city has significant mining operations of slate, and a local whetstone, called coticule. The extracted coticule in Vielsalm owes its very fine abrasive properties to spessartine, which is a particular variety of garnet . The coticule is a metamorphic microcristalin schist, very fine grained, 35 to 40% of it small crystals of spessartine, of about 5 to 20 ¬µm in diameter. These quarries, which are now almost exhausted, have been operating since the beginning of the 16th century to make razor stones prized for their longevity. The town currently has an industrial zone in Burtonville, in which are located small and medium-sized enterprises. Culture There is an annual F√™te de la Myrtille, or Feast of the Blueberries, which started on July 21, 1951. The local Traders Association wanted a way to attract visitors to stop in the town. So they had local people in traditional costume invite visitors stop and handed them a small dish of local fruit including blueberries. The parade features, amongst others, local folklore such as Les Macralles\\", or witches in Walloon.

Daily administration, by way implementing council resolutions, is the duty of the College of Aldermen, led by a mayor, acting as an executive body. The aldermen are elected for six years by the council from among its members, their number varying from two to ten according to population of the municipality (e.g. in 2012 there were the college mayor, four aldermen and the president of the Council of Social Action). The council is directly elected by the people to determine tax collection and expenditure, decide education issues, maintenance of the buildings, roads and green areas etc. The exact number depends upon the population of the municipality. Education There are seven schools in the municipality covering pre-school, primary and secondary education in the town. They are the √âcole communale de Goronne, √âcole communale primaire d'H√©bronval, √âcole communale de Petit-Thier, √âcole communale primaire de Regn√©, √âcole communale maternelle de Regn√©, √âcole communale de Rencheux, √âcole communale de Salmch√¢teau and √âcole communale primaire de Ville-du-Bois.

Though integrated development environments and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage a build process, Make remains widely used, especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. Besides building programs, Make can be used to manage any project where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change. Origin There are now a number of dependency-tracking build utilities, but Make is one of the most widespread, primarily due to its inclusion in Unix, starting with the PWB/UNIX 1.0, which featured a variety of tools targeting software development tasks. It was originally created by Stuart Feldman in April 1976 at Bell Labs. Feldman received the 2003 ACM Software System Award for the authoring of this widespread tool. Feldman was inspired to write Make by the experience of a coworker in futilely debugging a program of his where the executable was accidentally not being updated with changes: Before Make's introduction, the Unix build system most commonly consisted of operating system dependent \\"make\\" and \\"install\\" shell scripts accompanying their program's source. Being able to combine the commands for the different targets into a single file and being able to abstract out dependency tracking and archive handling was an important step in the direction of modern build environments. Derivatives Make has gone through a number of rewrites, including a number of from-scratch variants which used the same file format and basic algorithmic principles and also provided a number of their own non-standard enhancements. Some of them are: * Sun DevPro Make appeared in 1986 with SunOS-3.2. With SunOS-3.2, It was delivered as optional program; with SunOS-4.0, SunPro Make was made the default Make program. In December 2006, Sun DevPro Make was made open source as part of the efforts to open-source Solaris.Grisanzio, Jim. The OpenSolaris Story. * dmake or Distributed Make that came with Sun Solaris Studio as its default Make, but not the default one on the Solaris Operating System (SunOS). It was originally required to build OpenOffice, but in 2009 the build system was rewritten to use GNU Make. While Apache OpenOffice still contains a mixture of both build systems, the much more actively developed LibreOffice only uses the modernized \\"gbuild\\" now. * BSD Make (pmake, bmakehttps://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bmake&sektion;=1 or fmake), which is derived from Adam de Boor's work on a version of Make capable of building targets in parallel, and survives with varying degrees of modification in FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. Distinctively, it has conditionals and iterative loops which are applied at the parsing stage and may be used to conditionally and programmatically construct the makefile, including generation of targets at runtime. * GNU Make (short gmake) is the standard implementation of Make for Linux and macOS. It provides several extensions over the original Make, such as conditionals. It also provides many built-in functions which can be used to eliminate the need for shell-scripting in the makefile rules as well as to manipulate the variables set and used in the makefile. For example, the foreach function sets a variable to the list of all files in a given directory. GNU Make is required for building many software systems, including GCC (since version 3.4), the Linux kernel, Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice, and Mozilla Firefox. * Rocky Bernstein's Remake is a fork of GNU Make and provides several extensions over GNU Make, such as better location and error-location reporting, execution tracing, execution profiling, and it contains a debugger. * Glenn Fowler's nmake is unrelated to the Microsoft program of the same name. Its input is similar to Make, but not compatible. This program provides shortcuts and built-in features, which according to its developers reduces the size of makefiles by a factor of 10. * Microsoft nmake, a command-line tool which normally is part of Visual Studio. It supports preprocessor directives such as includes and conditional expressions which use variables set on the command-line or within the makefiles. Inference rules differ from Make; for example they can include search paths. The Make tool supplied with Embarcadero products has a command- line option that \\"Causes MAKE to mimic Microsoft's NMAKE.\\" * Mk replaced Make in Research Unix, starting from version 9. A redesign of the original tool by Bell Labs programmer Andrew G. Hume, it features a different syntax. Mk became the standard build tool in Plan 9, Bell Labs' intended successor to Unix. POSIX includes standardization of the basic features and operation of the Make utility, and is implemented with varying degrees of completeness in Unix-based versions of Make. In general, simple makefiles may be used between various versions of Make with reasonable success. GNU Make, Makepp and some versions of BSD Make default to looking first for files named \\"GNUmakefile\\", \\"Makeppfile\\" and \\"BSDmakefile\\" respectively, which allows one to put makefiles which use implementation-defined behavior in separate locations. Behavior Make is typically used to build executable programs and libraries from source code. Generally though, Make is applicable to any process that involves executing arbitrary commands to transform a source file to a target result. For example, Make could be used to detect a change made to an image file (the source) and the transformation actions might be to convert the file to some specific format, copy the result into a content management system, and then send e-mail to a predefined set of users indicating that the above actions were performed. Make is invoked with a list of target file names to build as command-line arguments: make [TARGET ...] Without arguments, Make builds the first target that appears in its makefile, which is traditionally a symbolic \\"phony\\" target named all. Make decides whether a target needs to be regenerated by comparing file modification times.How to sort Linux ls command file output This solves the problem of avoiding the building of files which are already up to date, but it fails when a file changes but its modification time stays in the past. Such changes could be caused by restoring an older version of a source file, or when a network filesystem is a source of files and its clock or time zone is not synchronized with the machine running Make. The user must handle this situation by forcing a complete build. Conversely, if a source file's modification time is in the future, it triggers unnecessary rebuilding, which may inconvenience users. Makefile Make searches the current directory for the makefile to use, e.g. GNU Make searches files in order for a file named one of , , or and then runs the specified (or default) target(s) from (only) that file. The makefile language is similar to declarative programming.an overview on dsls , 2007/02/27, phoenix wikiRe: Choreography and REST , from Christopher B Ferris on 2002-08-09Target Junior Makefiles , Andrew W. Fitzgibbon and William A. Hoffman This class of language, in which necessary end conditions are described but the order in which actions are to be taken is not important, is sometimes confusing to programmers used to imperative programming. One problem in build automation is the tailoring of a build process to a given platform. For instance, the compiler used on one platform might not accept the same options as the one used on another. This is not well handled by Make. This problem is typically handled by generating platform-specific build instructions, which in turn are processed by Make. Common tools for this process are Autoconf, CMake or GYP (or more advanced NG). =Rules= A makefile consists of rules. Each rule begins with a textual dependency line which defines a target followed by a colon (:) and optionally an enumeration of components (files or other targets) on which the target depends. The dependency line is arranged so that the target (left hand of the colon) depends on components (right hand of the colon). It is common to refer to components as prerequisites of the target. target [target ...]: [component ...] [command 1] . . . [command n] Usually each rule has a single unique target, rather than multiple targets. For example, a C .o object file is created from .c files, so .c files come first (i.e. specific object file target depends on a C source file and header files). Because Make itself does not understand, recognize or distinguish different kinds of files, this opens up a possibility for human error. A forgotten or an extra dependency may not be immediately obvious and may result in subtle bugs in the generated software. It is possible to write makefiles which generate these dependencies by calling third-party tools, and some makefile generators, such as the Automake toolchain provided by the GNU Project, can do so automatically. Each dependency line may be followed by a series of TAB indented command lines which define how to transform the components (usually source files) into the target (usually the \\"output\\"). If any of the prerequisites has a more recent modification time than the target, the command lines are run. The GNU Make documentation refers to the commands associated with a rule as a \\"recipe\\". The first command may appear on the same line after the prerequisites, separated by a semicolon, targets : prerequisites ; command for example, hello: ; @echo \\"hello\\" Make can decide where to start through topological sorting. Each command line must begin with a tab character to be recognized as a command. The tab is a whitespace character, but the space character does not have the same special meaning. This is problematic, since there may be no visual difference between a tab and a series of space characters. This aspect of the syntax of makefiles is often subject to criticism; it has been described by Eric S. Raymond as \\"one of the worst design botches in the history of Unix\\"\\"Chapter 15. Tools: make: Automating Your Recipes\\", The Art of Unix Programming, Eric S. Raymond 2003 and The Unix-Haters Handbook said \\"using tabs as part of the syntax is like one of those pungee stick traps in The Green Berets\\". Feldman explains the choice as caused by a workaround for an early implementation difficulty preserved by a desire for backward compatibility with the very first users: However, the GNU Make since version 3.82 allows to choose any symbol (one character) as the recipe prefix using the .RECIPEPREFIX special variable, for example: .RECIPEPREFIX := : all: :@echo \\"recipe prefix symbol is set to '$(.RECIPEPREFIX)'\\" Each command is executed by a separate shell or command- line interpreter instance. Since operating systems use different command-line interpreters this can lead to unportable makefiles. For instance, GNU Make (all POSIX Makes) by default executes commands with /bin/sh, where Unix commands like cp are normally used. In contrast to that, Microsoft's nmake executes commands with cmd.exe where batch commands like copy are available but not necessarily cp. A rule may have no command lines defined. The dependency line can consist solely of components that refer to targets, for example: realclean: clean distclean The command lines of a rule are usually arranged so that they generate the target. An example: if is newer, it is converted to text. The contents of the makefile: file.txt: file.html lynx -dump file.html > file.txt The above rule would be triggered when Make updates \\"file.txt\\". In the following invocation, Make would typically use this rule to update the \\"file.txt\\" target if \\"file.html\\" were newer. make file.txt Command lines can have one or more of the following three prefixes: * a hyphen-minus (-), specifying that errors are ignored * an at sign (@), specifying that the command is not printed to standard output before it is executed * a plus sign (+), the command is executed even if Make is invoked in a \\"do not execute\\" mode Ignoring errors and silencing echo can alternatively be obtained via the special targets \\".IGNORE\\" and \\".SILENT\\". Microsoft's NMAKE has predefined rules that can be omitted from these makefiles, e.g. \\"c.obj $(CC)$(CFLAGS)\\". =Macros= A makefile can contain definitions of macros. Macros are usually referred to as variables when they hold simple string definitions, like \\"CC=clang\\". Macros in makefiles may be overridden in the command-line arguments passed to the Make utility. Environment variables are also available as macros. Macros allow users to specify the programs invoked and other custom behavior during the build process. For example, the macro \\"CC\\" is frequently used in makefiles to refer to the location of a C compiler, and the user may wish to specify a particular compiler to use. New macros (or simple \\"variables\\") are traditionally defined using capital letters: MACRO = definition A macro is used by expanding it. Traditionally this is done by enclosing its name inside . (Omitting the parentheses leads to Make interpreting the next letter after the as the entire variable name.) An equivalent form uses curly braces rather than parentheses, i.e. , which is the style used in the BSDs. NEW_MACRO = $(MACRO)-$(MACRO2) Macros can be composed of shell commands by using the command substitution operator, denoted by backticks (). YYYYMMDD = \` date \` The content of the definition is stored \\"as is\\". Lazy evaluation is used, meaning that macros are normally expanded only when their expansions are actually required, such as when used in the command lines of a rule. An extended example: PACKAGE = package VERSION = \` date +\\"%Y.%m%d\\" \` ARCHIVE = $(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION) dist: # Notice that only now macros are expanded for shell to interpret: # tar -cf package-\`date +\\"%Y%m%d\\"\`.tar tar -cf $(ARCHIVE).tar . The generic syntax for overriding macros on the command line is: make MACRO=\\"value\\" [MACRO=\\"value\\" ...] TARGET [TARGET ...] Makefiles can access any of a number of predefined internal macros, with '?' and '@' being the most common. target: component1 component2 # contains those components which need attention (i.e. they ARE YOUNGER than current TARGET). echo $? # evaluates to current TARGET name from among those left of the colon. echo $@ A somewhat common syntax expansion is the use of , , and instead of the equal sign. It works on BSD and GNU makes alike. =Suffix rules= Suffix rules have \\"targets\\" with names in the form and are used to launch actions based on file extension. In the command lines of suffix rules, POSIX specifies that the internal macro refers to the first prerequisite and refers to the target. In this example, which converts any HTML file into text, the shell redirection token is part of the command line whereas is a macro referring to the HTML file: .SUFFIXES: .txt .html # From .html to .txt .html.txt: lynx -dump $< > $@ When called from the command line, the above example expands. $ make -n file.txt lynx -dump file.html > file.txt =Pattern rules = Suffix rules cannot have any prerequisites of their own. If they have any, they are treated as normal files with unusual names, not as suffix rules. GNU Make supports suffix rules for compatibility with old makefiles but otherwise encourages usage of pattern rules. A pattern rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains exactly one character '%'. The target is considered a pattern for matching file names: the '%' can match any substring of zero or more characters,See section Pattern Matching Rules in the SunPro man page while other characters match only themselves. The prerequisites likewise use '%' to show how their names relate to the target name. The above example of a suffix rule would look like the following pattern rule: # From %.html to %.txt %.txt : %.html lynx -dump $< > $@ =Other elements= Single-line comments are started with the hash symbol (#). Some directives in makefiles can include other makefiles. Line continuation is indicated with a backslash character at the end of a line. target: component \\\\ component command ; \\\\ command  \\\\ piped-command Example makefiles Makefiles are traditionally used for compiling code (*.c, *.cc, *.C, etc.), but they can also be used for providing commands to automate common tasks. One such makefile is called from the command line: make # Without argument runs first TARGET make help # Show available TARGETS make dist # Make a release archive from current dir The makefile: PACKAGE = package VERSION = \` date \\"+%Y.%m%d%\\" \` RELEASE_DIR = .. RELEASE_FILE = $(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION) # Notice that the variable LOGNAME comes from the environment in # POSIX shells. # # target: all - Default target. Does nothing. all: echo \\"Hello $(LOGNAME), nothing to do by default\\" # sometimes: echo \\"Hello \${LOGNAME}, nothing to do by default\\" echo \\"Try 'make help'\\" # target: help - Display callable targets. help: egrep \\"^# target:\\" [Mm]akefile # target: list - List source files list: # Won't work. Each command is in separate shell cd src ls # Correct, continuation of the same shell cd src; \\\\ ls # target: dist - Make a release. dist: tar -cf $(RELEASE_DIR)/$(RELEASE_FILE) && \\\\ gzip -9 $(RELEASE_DIR)/$(RELEASE_FILE).tar Below is a very simple makefile that by default (the \\"all\\" rule is listed first) compiles a source file called \\"helloworld.c\\" using the system's C compiler and also provides a \\"clean\\" target to remove the generated files if the user desires to start over. The and are two of the so-called internal macros (also known as automatic variables) and stand for the target name and \\"implicit\\" source, respectively. In the example below, expands to a space delimited list of the prerequisites. There are a number of other internal macros.Automatic Variables GNU \`make' CFLAGS ?= -g all: helloworld helloworld: helloworld.o # Commands start with TAB not spaces $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^ helloworld.o: helloworld.c $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $< clean: FRC rm -f helloworld helloworld.o # This pseudo target causes all targets that depend on FRC # to be remade even in case a file with the name of the target exists. # This works with any make implementation under the assumption that # there is no file FRC in the current directory. FRC: Many systems come with predefined Make rules and macros to specify common tasks such as compilation based on file suffix. This lets users omit the actual (often unportable) instructions of how to generate the target from the source(s). On such a system the above makefile could be modified as follows: all: helloworld helloworld: helloworld.o $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^ clean: FRC rm -f helloworld helloworld.o # This is an explicit suffix rule. It may be omitted on systems # that handle simple rules like this automatically. .c.o: $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< FRC: .SUFFIXES: .c That \\"helloworld.o\\" depends on \\"helloworld.c\\" is now automatically handled by Make. In such a simple example as the one illustrated here this hardly matters, but the real power of suffix rules becomes evident when the number of source files in a software project starts to grow. One only has to write a rule for the linking step and declare the object files as prerequisites. Make will then implicitly determine how to make all the object files and look for changes in all the source files. Simple suffix rules work well as long as the source files do not depend on each other and on other files such as header files. Another route to simplify the build process is to use so-called pattern matching rules that can be combined with compiler- assisted dependency generation. As a final example requiring the gcc compiler and GNU Make, here is a generic makefile that compiles all C files in a folder to the corresponding object files and then links them to the final executable. Before compilation takes place, dependencies are gathered in makefile-friendly format into a hidden file \\".depend\\" that is then included to the makefile. Portable programs ought to avoid constructs used below. # Generic GNUMakefile # Just a snippet to stop executing under other make(1) commands # that won't understand these lines ifneq (,) This makefile requires GNU Make. endif PROGRAM = foo C_FILES := $(wildcard *.c) OBJS := $(patsubst %.c, %.o, $(C_FILES)) CC = cc CFLAGS = -Wall -pedantic LDFLAGS = LDLIBS = -lm all: $(PROGRAM) $(PROGRAM): .depend $(OBJS) $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(PROGRAM) $(LDLIBS) depend: .depend .depend: cmd = gcc -MM -MF depend $(var); cat depend >> .depend; .depend: @echo \\"Generating dependencies...\\" @$(foreach var, $(C_FILES), $(cmd)) @rm -f depend -include .depend # These are the pattern matching rules.

On 1 January 2007 the municipality, which covers 147.52 km¬≤, had 4,348 inhabitants, giving a population density of 29.5 inhabitants per km¬≤. Geography La Roche-en- Ardenne is located between the E25 Li√®ge-Luxembourg and the N4 motorways. More than half of the municipal area (about ) is covered in forests and is arable land, and only has been built on. The division between deciduous and coniferous forests is more or less equal.

History La Roche is believed to have first been settled in the Neolithic era. There is a Celtic archaeological site dating between 850 and 520 BC.The Romans built a fort there following their conquest of Gaul and the Ardennes. The town's medieval castle was in use between the 9th and 18th centuries. It provided protection to the many barges that plied their trade along the local river systems. In 1331, permission to build city walls was given by John the Blind, King of Bohemia and Poland and a Count of Luxembourg. In World War II, the town was occupied by both German and Allied forces, suffering severe damage. Freed by Americans in September 1944, the town was recaptured by the Germans in December, during the Battle of the Bulge. The subsequent Allied bombing raids resulted in the town being reoccupied by Americans once more in January 1945, but left much of it destroyed and 116 residents dead. An American Sherman M4A1 tank and a British Achilles SP 17pdr are displayed as monuments to the town's liberation.

Beausaint, Halleux, Hives, Ortho and Samr√©e were joined by Marcourt, formerly within the municipality of Rendeux. Economy Hiking, kayaking, and mountain biking are among the outdoor pursuits available here. The municipality's other main economic activity is agriculture. A business park was established on the plateau Vecmont to diversify the local economy. The ceramic stoneware of La Roche (cobalt blue pottery, glazed with salt) is a local tradition known, initiated in 1836 by Henry Hoffman, a native of Ransbach in the Duchy of Nassau. The production was revived in 1878 by the family Kalb and continued until 2009 by several successors. A permanent exhibition on this tradition. Governance Like other Belgian Municipalities, the town is governed by a Communal College, whose membership is determined by the size of the population. In 2012, that was the Mayor, Town Clerk and 3 Alderman. An elected City Council determined what local taxes are spent and on what. As of 2012, this had a membership of 9 councillors.

It is the unofficial capital of the Famenne region, sandwiched between the Condroz, former land of the Condrusi, to the north and the Ardennes to the south. The Marche-en-Famenne municipality includes the former municipalities (sections) of Aye, Grimbi√©mont, Hargimont, Hollogne, Humain, Ligni√®res, Marloie, On, Roy, Verdenne, and Waha. History =Middle Ages= In the early Middle Ages, Marche was just a little hamlet on the Marchette brook, one of the dependencies of the nearby Abbey of Stavelot. In the 12th century, this territory was made part of the County of La Roche. It was ideally located, on the main road between Namur and Luxembourg, and quickly evolved into a town, which obtained its charter in the 13th century. At the end of the century, in true medieval fashion, it acquired a complete system of defensive walls, with two gates, a series of watchtowers, and a keep. The market place and religious organizations, such as the Carmes convent founded in 1473, could thrive inside the closed city. Perpetual Edict (1577) =After 1500= When in 1555 Philip II of Spain, son of Charles V, inherited his father's empire, the freedoms of Spain‚Äôs Seventeen Provinces to the north were reduced considerably, giving rise to the Eighty Years' War. In the aftermath of the Pacification of Ghent, Don John of Austria, Philip II‚Äôs half brother, granted the Perpetual Edict, which was signed in the city in February 1577. The edict allowed for the departure of the Spanish troops and recognized most of the city‚Äôs freedoms, with the notable exception of religion. The war started again and Don John died a year later near Namur. The castle and defensive walls were dismantled at the end of the 17th century on the orders of Louis XIV. A century later, the French Revolutionary troops entered the city and closed the convent. Today, with its schools, light industries, military complex, and tourist attractions, Marche is a vibrant regional centre. Sights *The city centre includes a few interesting buildings, such as the St Remacle church and the old Carmes convent. *The city is the home of several museums, including a lace museum, which is housed in one of the last remnants of the city‚Äôs medieval walls and commemorates the hundreds of lace workers that lived in the Marche area in the 18th century. *The Famenne museum gives a good overview of the region‚Äôs art and history.

History =Early history= A Neolithic megalith dating from about 2000 BC and a Celtic necropolis dating from between the 5th and 2nd centuries BC have been found in this area, attesting to early human activity. Gallo-Roman sepultures and a small Roman villa were found here as well, showing the presence around the 2nd century AD of a minor agricultural domain. The region was used in Carolingian times mostly as a hunting area and population remained sparse throughout the Middle Ages. A document dating from 1100 shows that one of the many tiny hamlets in the area, Semel, was donated to the Abbey of Amdain (currently Saint-Hubert). In 1239, that same hamlet was mentioned as being part of the lordship of Neufch√¢teau, at the time when it was now given to the Orval Abbey. Like many of its neighbours, the lordship of Neufch√¢teau was part of the Duchy of Luxembourg. =17th century until now= An important document for the history of the Neufch√¢teu region is a 1609 painting entitled ‚ÄúLA TERRE ET PREVOSTEE DE NEVFCHASTEAV AVECQZ SES DESPENDENCES\\", now kept in the Arlon archives. The painting shows the town of Neufch√¢teau within its protective walls, at the foot of its castle, surrounded by a number of villages and hamlets. In the mid-17th century, the plague and Louis XIV‚Äôs wars decimated the area. After the French Revolution and until 1815, Neufch√¢teau became the chief town of the old French d√©partement of For√™ts. During World War I, its governor, Count Hans von Blumenthal, was one of a small number of German military officials who struck up a rapport with the local population, chiefly through his interest in hunting. Fighting in the area, however, was heavy, as more than 200 soldiers lost their lives in the first month of the war.

History of the Counts of Chiny Saint Walpurga's church The first dynasty ruled from 980 to 1384. From 980, Arnoul of Burgundy-Granson, became the first Count of Chiny. By his marriage to Mathilde, daughter of Ricuin, Duke of Mosellane and Count of Ardennes, he acquired the dowry of his wife, a land of forests rich with game, crossed by a capricious river, the Semois. His son Othon of Warcq, left his small fortress on the Meuse to site the Ch√¢teau de Chiny on a rocky spur overlooking the river. In the eleventh century, the Ch√¢teau was a formidable barrier in the region. The area that was ruled by the count was huge: 246 towns, 57 castles, 1412 villages. The fourth Count, Louis II, loved hunting parties and held them in his huge game park starting in 1040. It was then that the legend relates that a young lord named Thibault, a descendant of the Counts of Champagne, secretly left his father's house to offer his services in the Ardennes forest near Chiny, where he established a hermitage and found a source of holy springs. Louis II built a large shrine to the spring's healing powers. The shrine became famous, with many pilgrims who came to implore the grace of Saint-Thibault. Later, monks from Calabria, Italy, founded a Monastery nearby at Orval. Arnoul, a successor, regularly confronted Count Godfrey of Bouillon, leader of the first Crusade and nephew of Queen Mathilde. They eventually became friends and Arnoul entrusted Godfrey both his sons, Otto and Louis, to take part in the first Crusade. Returning from the Crusade, Otto, was in turn count of Chiny, but he found Orval falling in ruins. The Calabrian monks left in 1108, and the Cistercians revived Orval. Louis IV was the last count of the first dynasty. Having no son, he prepared Jeanne, his eldest daughter, as his successor. Louis IV marked his reign by the first postage stamp in the county. In marrying Jeanne, Arnulf of Looz became the first Count of the second dynasty. He was notable as the builder of the fortress of Montmedy. Their son, Louis V held a tournament of chivalry in 1285 that was regarded as the finest in the Middle Ages, at the village de Chauvency-le-Ch√¢teau. Over 500 knights of Europe attended this tournament and were memorialized in song by the bard Jacques Bretel. Louis V enjoyed great notoriety as a result. He died in 1299. His heart, per his last wishes, was embalmed and buried in a lead box in front of the altar at Saint-Thibault, in the village of Suxy. Thereafter, the Counts struggled to maintain their territory as wars and battles ensued. They were by turn, the vassals of the Count of Bar and John the Blind, King of Bohemia and Count of Luxembourg, all claiming the same lands. Seven Counts were named in less than thirty years. The father of Arnould Rumigny, last count of Chiny died of pneumonia a few months before the birth of his son. His young widow died in childbirth, and the son, Arnould, sold his lands rather than allow his malevolent uncle's offspring to inherit. On 13 June 1364, the lands of Chiny were sold to Wenceslas, Duke of Luxembourg. Later, in the 15th century, the Count de Faing was created and his Ch√¢teau was erected, which was later reconstructed and stands today.

It is also the administrative centre of the district (arrondissement) of the same name, as well as the principal town of the small region of Belgian Lorraine known as the Gaume, famous for its microclimate. The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Virton proper, Bleid, Ethe, Latour, Ruette, and Saint-Mard. Other population centers include: Chenois, Gomery, Grandcourt, and Saint-Remy. History =Antiquity and Middle Ages= Several archeological finds indicate that the area was already inhabited before the Romans built villas there and named the town Vertunum. In the early 5th century, the Romans had to flee the Germanic invasions. Their settlement was destroyed and rebuilt by the Franks somewhat north of its original site. Virton was mentioned for the first time in Pope Lucius III's bull of 1183 as a fiefdom of the House of Chiny. As overlords of Virton, the Counts of Chiny could levy taxes (the tonlieu) on the various goods sold at the local market, which is attested as early as 1270. In 1441, the Duchy of Luxembourg was sold to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. From that date, Virton, like many other Walloon cities, became embroiled in more than two centuries of wars between France, Spain, and the Netherlands, with all the fighting, famine, epidemics (including plague), and economic disasters that ensued. The city fared better under the rule of Maria Theresa of Austria in the 18th century, thanks in part to the development of Lorraine's steel industry. =Modern times= The French Revolution shattered those advances. Virton had to wait until the departure of Napoleon in 1815 to see prosperous times again. Virton enthusiastically participated in the Belgian Revolution and even in the French Revolution of 1848. On August 22, 1914, at the onset of World War I, hundreds of inhabitants were summarily executed by the invading German army, while mass deportations occurred during World War II. Virton is now the centre of commerce and tourism for the Gaume region. The town became an icon in Israeli sports history after Maccabi Tel Aviv defeated CSKA Moscow 91:79 in a European Basketball Champions' Cup game on 17 February 1977, in the town's sports arena. CSKA hosted the game in Virton due to lack of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Israel at the time. The victory is widely considered as pivotal in Maccabi's history, thus making the town's name widely known among Israeli sports fans.

It is still in service in upgraded form with the Indian Air Force. Originally conceived in the 1960s as a jet trainer with a light ground attack capability, the requirement for the aircraft soon changed to include supersonic performance, reconnaissance and tactical nuclear strike roles. A carrier-based variant was also planned for French Navy service, but this was cancelled in favour of the cheaper Dassault Super √âtendard. The aircraft were manufactured by SEPECAT (Soci√©t√© Europ√©enne de Production de l'avion Ecole de Combat et d'Appui Tactique), a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation, one of the first major joint-Anglo-French military aircraft programmes. The Jaguar was exported to India, Oman, Ecuador and Nigeria. With various air forces, the Jaguar was used in numerous conflicts and military operations in Mauritania, Chad, Iraq, Bosnia, and Pakistan, as well as providing a ready nuclear delivery platform for the United Kingdom, France, and India throughout the latter half of the Cold War and beyond. In the Gulf War, the Jaguar was praised for its reliability and was a valuable coalition resource. The aircraft served with the French Air Force as the main strike/attack aircraft until 1 July 2005, and with the Royal Air Force until the end of April 2007. It was replaced by the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon in the RAF and the Dassault Rafale in the French Air Force. Development =Background= RAF Jaguar T2 in flight displaying underside, 1,187 litre tanks and CBLS (carrier, bomb, light store) fitted to its under-wing pylons. The Jaguar programme began in the early 1960s, in response to a British requirement (Air Staff Target 362) for an advanced supersonic jet trainer to replace the Folland Gnat T1 and Hawker Hunter T7, and a French requirement (ECAT or √âcole de Combat et d'Appui Tactique, \\"Tactical Combat Support Trainer\\") for a cheap, subsonic dual role trainer and light attack aircraft to replace the Fouga Magister, Lockheed T-33 and Dassault Myst√®re IV.\\"Military Dassault aircraft: Jaguar.\\" Dassault Aviation. Retrieved: 15 November 2010.Bowman 2007, pp. 12‚Äì13. In both countries several companies tendered designs: BAC, Hunting, Hawker Siddeley and Folland in Britain; Breguet, Potez, Sud-Aviation, Nord, and Dassault from France. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May 1965 for the two countries to develop two aircraft, a trainer based on the ECAT, and the larger AFVG (Anglo-French Variable Geometry).Jackson 1992, p. 56. Cross-channel negotiations led to the formation of SEPECAT (Soci√©t√© Europ√©enne de Production de l'Avion d'√âcole de Combat et d'Appui Tactique ‚Äì the \\"European company for the production of a combat trainer and tactical support aircraft\\"Wagner 2009, p. 122.) in 1966 as a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation to produce the airframe. Though based in part on the Breguet Br.121, using the same basic configuration and an innovative French-designed landing gear, the Jaguar was built incorporating major elements of design from BAC, notably the wing and high lift devices.Jackson 1992, pp. 58, 71. Production of components would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; one in the UK and one in France,Bowman 2007, pp. 14‚Äì17. To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining the illusion of a shared design, the British design departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 to such a degree that it was effectively a new design.http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/jaguar/history.php A separate partnership was formed between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca to develop the Adour afterburning turbofan engine.Taylor 1980, p. 708. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both. The new engine, which would be used for the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.Bowman 2007. p18-19 Previous collaborative efforts between Britain and France had been complicated ‚Äì the AFVG programme ended in cancellation, and controversy surrounded the development of the supersonic airliner Concorde.Wallace 1984, p. 27. Whilst the technical collaboration between BAC and Breguet went well, when Dassault took over Breguet in 1971 it encouraged acceptance of its own designs, such as the Super √âtendard naval attack aircraft and the Mirage F1, for which it would receive more profit, over the Anglo-French Jaguar.Jackson 1992, p. 77. The initial plan was for Britain to buy 150 Jaguar \\"B\\" trainers, with its strike requirements being met by the advanced BAC-Dassault AFVG aircraft, with France to buy 75 \\"E\\" trainers (√©cole) and 75 \\"A\\" single-seat strike attack aircraft (appui). Dassault favoured its own Mirage G aircraft above the collaborative AFVG, and in June 1967, France cancelled the AFVG on cost grounds.Segell 1998, p. 169. This left a gap in the RAF's planned strike capabilities for the 1970s; at the same time as France's cancellation of the AFVG, Germany was expressing a serious interest in the Jaguar,Segell 1998, p. 172. and thus the design became more oriented towards the low-level strike role.Jackson 1992, pp. 56, 58. The RAF had initially planned on a buy of 150 trainers; however, with both the BAC TSR-2 tactical strike aircraft and Hawker Siddeley P.1154 supersonic V/STOL fighter cancelled, the RAF were looking increasingly hard at their future light strike needs and realizing that they now needed more than just advanced trainers with some secondary counter insurgency capability. The RAF's strike line-up was at this point intended to consist of American General Dynamics F-111s plus the AFVG for lighter strike purposes. There was concern that both F-111 and AFVG were high risk projects and with the French already planning on a strike role for the Jaguar, there was an opportunity to introduce a serious backup plan for the RAF's future strike needs ‚Äì the Jaguar. As a result, by October 1970, the RAF's requirements had changed to 165 single-seat strike aircraft and 35 trainers.Jackson 1992, p. 58. The Jaguar was to replace the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 in the close air support, tactical reconnaissance and tactical strike roles, freeing the Phantom to be used for air defence.Hobbs 2008, p.37. Both the French and British trainer requirements had developed significantly, and were eventually fulfilled instead by the Alpha Jet and Hawker Siddeley Hawk respectively.Wallace 1984, p. 28. The French, meanwhile, had chosen the Jaguar to replace the Aeronavale's Dassault √âtendard IV, and increased their order to include an initial 40 of a carrier- capable maritime version of the Jaguar, the Jaguar M, for the Aeronavale.Bowman 2007, p. 21. From these apparently disparate aims would come a single and entirely different aircraft: relatively high-tech, supersonic, and optimised for ground-attack in a high-threat environment.Wagner 2009, pp. 122‚Äì123. =Prototypes= The first of eight prototypes flew on 8 September 1968, a two-seat design fitted with the first production model Adour engine.Flight 12 September 1968, p. 391.Taylor 1971, p. 107. This aircraft later went supersonic on its third flight but was lost on landing on 26 March 1970 following an engine fire. The second prototype flew in February 1969; a total of three prototypes appeared in flight at the Paris Air Show that year. The first French \\"A\\" prototype flew in March 1969. In October a British \\"S\\" conducted its first flight.Flight 16 October 1969, p. 600. An \\"M\\" prototype flew in November 1969. The \\"M\\" had a strengthened airframe, an arrestor hook and different undercarriage: twin nosewheel and single mainwheels. After testing in France it went to RAE at Thurleigh for carrier landing trials from their land based catapult, after which, in July 1970, it underwent a series of shipboard trials from the French carrier Clemenceau. From these trials there were doubts about the throttle response in case of an aborted landing; the shipboard testing also revealed problems with the aircraft's handling when flying on one engine, although planned engine improvements were to have rectified these problems. The \\"M\\" was considered a suitable replacement for the Etendard IV but the Aeronavale would only be able to purchase 60 instead of 100 aircraft.Bowman 2007, p. 23-27. Furthermore, the Jaguar M was expensive, limiting the size of the force the French Navy could afford. In 1971, Dassault proposed the Super √âtendard, claiming that it was a simpler and cheap development of the existing √âtendard IV, and in 1973, the French Navy agreed to order it instead of the Jaguar, although rising costs of the Super √âtendard meant that only 71 of the planned 100 aircraft were purchased. The M was cancelled by the French government in 1973.Bowman 2007, p. 26. Design =Overview= RAF Jaguar GR3 with view of overwing AIM-9L Sidewinder missile. The Jaguar is an orthodox single-seat, swept-wing, twin-engine monoplane design, with tall tricycle-type retractable landing gear. In its original configuration, it had a maximum take-off weight in the 15 tonne class;Taylor 1980, pp. 106‚Äì107. and could manage a combat radius on internal fuel alone of , giving the Jaguar a greater operational range than competitor aircraft such as the Mikoyan MiG-27.Tellis 2001, p. 535. The aircraft had hardpoints fitted for an external weapons load of up to 10,000 lb (4,500 kg), typical weapons fitted included the MATRA LR.F2 rocket pod, BAP 100-mm bombs, MATRA AS37 anti- radar missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and Rockeye cluster bombs.Glenn 2005, p. 9.Glenn 2005, p. 40. The RAF's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Gulf War, including CRV7 high-velocity rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs.Jackson 1992, pp. 63‚Äì66. Finally, the Jaguar was equipped with either a pair of French DEFA cannons,Owen 2000, p. 217. or alternatively British ADEN cannons.Wagner 2009, p. 123. The Jaguar International had the unusual optional provision for fitting overwing pylons, used for short-range air-to-air missiles, such as the Matra R550 Magic or the AIM-9 Sidewinder. This option freed up the under-wing pylons for other weapons and stores. RAF Jaguars gained overwing pylons in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990,Jackson 1992, p. 64. but French Jaguars were not modified.Jackson 1992, p. 69. The RAF's Jaguar 97s were intended to be wired for the carriage of ASRAAMs on the overwing launchers, but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts.Lake Air International December 2000, p. 360.Ripley, Tim. \\"Mixed news for contractors in UK defence spending plans.\\" Flightglobal.com, 25 July 2000.

A separate partnership was formed between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca to develop the Adour, a two-shaft turbofan engine with afterburner. Twin engines were selected for survivability; ease of maintenance was a major consideration, an engine change being possible within 30 minutes. For the Jaguars it needed a low bypass capable of high thrust for take off, supersonic flight and low level \\"dashes\\".Bowman 2007, p. 19-20. mid-air refueling. When the first prototype Jaguar flew on 8 September 1968, it was also the first flight for the engine. In its initial development the Adour engine had complications with the stability of the afterburner system,Gunston, Bill. \\"The Phoenix of Derby.\\" New Scientist, Vol. 52, No. 773, 9 December 1971, p. 76. and shipboard testing showed slow throttle response times, problematic in the situation of an aborted landing; engine improvements rectified these problems prior to the Jaguar coming into service.

Even following the Jaguar's retirement in Europe, the Adour continues to be an active product with new variants being developed. As of February 2013, the Indian Air Force was considering fitting 125 Jaguars with new Honeywell F125IN engines. FlightGlobal, Retrieved: 8 September 2013. =Avionics= Cockpit of an RAF Jaguar GR3A. From the outset the Jaguar was equipped with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low. There were many more systems added with the time, like the Atlis II in the French aircraft, and, in 1994‚Äì95, some GR1s had laser-designator systems fitted. Missiles like AS-30 and even the anti-ship Sea Eagle were added. Some IAF aircraft had the Agave radar system, purposely for maritime strike. India later developed the DARIN system in its Jaguar fleet, with a modern 1553 databus. Although in operational theatres such as the Gulf War the Jaguar proved to be mechanically more reliable than the Panavia Tornado, the aircraft's avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions.Donald and Chant 2001, p. 34. Owing to the Jaguar A's shortcomings in navigation and target acquisition, French Jaguars had to be escorted by Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft to act as guides. The Jaguar provided a valuable component of the campaign, the RAF detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft lost.Jackson 1992, p. 93. Significant changes were made both during and shortly after the war. Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, a recent technology at the time.Russell and Hasik 2002, p. 151. Prior to 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina known as Operation Deliberate Force, a dozen Jaguars were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively.Lake Air International October 1997, pp. 226‚Äì228. Shortly afterwards, the RAF upgraded its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating TIALD and the ability to use new reconnaissance pods. The interim GR3 (Jaguar 96) upgrade added a new HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation.Barrie Flight International via flightglobal.com, 8‚Äì14 April 1998, pp. 30‚Äì32.Lake Air International November 1997, pp. 274‚Äì276.

For type conversion training, France also took 40 of the two-seat Jaguar E. While the Jaguar was capable of carrying a single AN-52 nuclear bomb, the French government did not assign any Jaguars for use in the Force de frappe, France's strategic nuclear deterrent; this task was carried out by the Dassault Mirage IV, and the later Mirage 2000-N.Croddy and Wirtz 2005, pp. 276, 361. Nuclear armed Jaguars were instead assigned the \\"Pre- Strategic\\" role, to clear a path for the Strategic strike force.Jackson 1992, pp. 80, 100. The AN-52 nuclear bomb was retired from service in September 1991, when the formerly nuclear-armed squadrons of Escadron de Chasse 7 then concentrated on conventional attack. French Jaguars also performed in the role of Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) aircraft, bearing the Martel anti- radiation missile, capable of staying airborne to suppress enemy defences for long periods of time through mid air refuelling.Glenn 2005, p. 8. alt=Jet aircraft being towed on taxiway towards left of camera.

In support of the further military action in the region, known as Operation Manta, Jaguars were deployed to Bangui, Central African Republic, in 1983, before being rebased inside Chad at N'Djamena International Airport. On 25 January 1984, Jaguars attacked a rebel column that was withdrawing after raiding the town of Zigey. One aircraft was shot down and the pilot, Captain Michel Croci, was killed; the Libyans denied involvement.Shaked and Dishion 1984, p. 589. The \\"Manta\\" forces were withdrawn in 1984, as part of a de- escalation agreement, whereby both Libyan and French forces were to be withdrawn from Chad. The Libyans did not respect the agreement, and Jaguars returned to Chad in 1986, as part of Operation Epervier, this time with a more forceful role. On 16 February 1986, 11 Jaguars, escorted by Mirage F1 fighters and supported by C-135F tankers and Breguet Atlantic aircraft, launched a raid on the airfield at Wadi Doum, which the Libyans had constructed in Northern Chad, using BAP-100 anti-runway bombs.Burr and Collins 2008, p. 201.

Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with GPS receivers, RAF Tornadoes also required adaption to a lesser extent. The French Jaguar force in Saudi Arabia built up to a maximum of 28 aircraft, which carried out 615 combat sorties, with one Jaguar damaged by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile.Jackson 1992, p. 92. Typical targets were Iraqi armoured units, Scud missile sites, and naval vessels. On 15 January 1991, 12 French Jaguars bombed Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait; three were damaged in the attack but all returned to base. On 26 January, RAF Jaguars and Tornadoes raided several Silkworm missile batteries in Kuwait to encourage the perception of an imminent amphibious invasion to liberate the country.Glenn 2005, p. 41. On the 30th, two RAF Jaguars destroyed a Polnochny-class landing ship with rockets and cannon.Bowman 2007, pp. 174‚Äì175.

The Jaguars also performed valuable reconnaissance of the combat area for Coalition forces. Both nations' Jaguars were withdrawn from the region in March 1991, at the end of Desert Storm. In Operation Deliberate Force, the NATO bombing campaign over Bosnia in 1995, six Jaguars, based in Italy, conducted 63 strike missions.

Two further squadrons, 2 Squadron and 41 Squadron based at RAF Laarbruch and RAF Coltishall respectively, were primarily tasked with tactical reconnaissance.Wagner 2009, p. 124. From 1975 the OCU's wartime role was as an operational squadron in the front line assigned to SACEUR with 12 Jaguar aircraft, eight WE.177 nuclear bombs, and a variety of conventional weapons. In April 1975, a single Jaguar was used to test the aircraft's rough airstrip capacity, by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway, the final test flight was conducted with a full weapons load; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised runways might be the only runways left available in a large scale European conflict.Glenn 2005, p. 19. In a high intensity European war, the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the Continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase, leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the entire allocated stockpile of 56 nuclear bombs.\\"WE.177 Carriage.\\" nuclear-weapons.info.

The RAF's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Persian Gulf War, including CRV7 high-velocity rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs which were used because the RAF's existing BL755 bombs were designed for low-level release, and therefore unsuitable for higher-altitude operations common over the Persian Gulf.

Following their retirement from flying service, many Jaguars continue to serve as ground instructional airframes, most notably at RAF Cosford, used in the training of RAF fitters. =India= India had been approached as a possible customer for the Jaguar as early as 1968, but had declined, partly on the grounds that it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service.Cohen and Dasgupta 2010, p. 77. India had already its Marut fighter-bomber, and tried to upgrade it with new engines, until the new project collapsed. A decade later IAF would become the largest single export customer, with a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a long and difficult evaluation process.Barua 2005, p. 274.Air International October 1988, pp. 177‚Äì181. The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton, and 120 licence-built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the local name Shamsher (\\"Sword of Justice\\"). As an interim measure, 18 Royal Air Force Jaguars were loaned to the Indian Air Force, with the first two loaned aircraft operational with Western Air Command on 27 July 1979.Green et al. 1982, p. 16. The second batch of aircraft for the Indian Air Force were 40 Jaguar Internationals built at Warton, the first aircraft being delivered in March 1981.Jackson 1992, p. 108. Batch Three was the assembly of another 45 aircraft by HAL of kits shipped from the United Kingdom, the first kit being shipped to India in May 1981. In the following phases more aircraft would be built in India with less European content. A total of 80 aircraft were built by HAL.https://www.bharat- rakshak.com/IAF/aircraft/specs/560-bae-jaguar.html A pair of Indian Air Force Jaguars flying in formation besides a pair of Indian Navy Sea Harriers and a pair of U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets, flying over the Indian Navy aircraft carrier INS Viraat during Exercise Malabar. Indian Jaguars were quite different from the RAF ones. The Adour Mk 811 engines were soon adopted, in the HAL production line (the previous Jaguars made in UK had the earlier Mk 804), giving 8,400 lbf each. There were R-550 Magic 1 or 2 in rails over the wings. But more important, the NAWASS, even if very modern in conception, was replaced because it was found quite unreliable. RAF was already upgrading the system with the modern Ferranti Type 1024 INS, but to India was offered the 1024E (export, less powerful version). So IAF pursued instead the development of a total new nav-attack system, called DARIN, that combined several technologies from France, UK and other sources. This system was more reliable and more precise than the older NAWASS and all the IAF Jaguars had it as a standard system. The Jaguar was found to be a long-range, fast, stable and effective strike aircraft in IAF service. Another important upgrade was the Maritime Strike version, fitted with a radar (the French Agave) and powerful British anti-ship missiles, produced in a very limited number (12). The only real issue with Jaguar is about the lack of power at altitude, especially with heavy ordnance on board. Indian Jaguars were used to carry out reconnaissance missions in support of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990. They later played an active role in the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, dropping both unguided and laser-guided bombs, the IAF defining its role as a \\"deep penetrating strike aircraft\\".Abbas, Ahmed. \\"Indian Ambitions for Aerospace Supremacy: Options for Pakistan.\\" Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, Retrieved: 2 January 2011.

The Jaguar remains an important element of the Indian military as, along with the Mirage 2000, the Jaguar has been described as one of the few aircraft capable of performing the nuclear strike role with reasonable chances of success.Tellis 2001, p. 533. It has been alleged that the Indian military decided against developing the Jaguar into an active nuclear platform because of its lack of ground clearance for deploying India's gravity-dropped nuclear bombs.Tellis 2001, p. 542. As the aircraft aged, the avionics were viewed as lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission, such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation or modern night- flight systems;Tellis 2001, p. 546. consequently, several upgrades were carried out in the mid-1990s, including the addition of the Litening targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001‚Äì2002.Wilson and McBride 2009, p. 68. The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines, Honeywell F125IN, to improve performance, particularly at medium altitudes.Wilson and McBride 2009, p. 71. The latest upgrade program DARIN III (Display Attack Ranging Inertial Navigation) has also been approved. In addition to new avionics and equipment installed as part of DARIN II upgrade, DARIN III would feature modified avionics architecture, new cockpit with dual SMD, solid state flight data recorder and solid state video recording system, auto pilot system, integration of new multi-mode radar on Jaguar IS (currently only Jaguar IM are fitted with radars). Major structural modification would be carried out on the air frame to accommodate the radar. Initial Jaguars delivered to the IAF were powered by two Adour 804E; further deliveries were powered by Adour Mk811. All the current IAF Jaguars are powered by Adour Mk811. DARIN III upgrade will cause additional weight problems due to addition of new avionics and radar, resulting in it becoming underpowered. Later IAF took decisions not to upgrade the engines due to budget problems =Other operators= Il-38 in 1987alt=Black-and-white photography of jet aircraft, carrying external fuel tank under fuselage, accompanying behind a four-turboprop-driven aircraft. Early in development, it was decided that the Jaguar should be offered for export. In 1969, while still in the prototype stage of development, formal approaches had been made to Switzerland, India, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale.Flight 16 October 1969, p. 604. Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar,Lake 1994, p.139. but these plans failed in part because of the high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition.Segell 1998, p. 168. Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not result in any orders.Glenn 2005, p. 32. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead chose F1s.Eden 2004, p. 398. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to an arms embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s. Jaguars were successfully sold to a number of overseas countries, India being the largest operator. The Jaguar International was an export version which was sold to Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman. The Ecuadorian Air Force, the only Latin American export customer, purchased 10 single- and 2 two-seat variants, officially designated Jaguars ES and EB, respectively. The first of twelve aircraft arrived in January 1977. They were used mainly for ground attack roles and occasionally for air superiority duties during the Cenepa War with Peru in 1995, but the main part of the fleet was held in reserve in case of a wider conflict with the Peruvians.Cooper, Tom. \\"Peru vs. Ecuador; Alto-Cenepa War, 1995.\\" Air Combat Information Group, 1 September 2003.

They have released four studio albums since 2001 and toured internationally since their formation. History After releasing their debut single \\"Terry\\" on the indie Noisebox Records label in the UK they were signed to The Police manager Miles Copeland III's Ark 21 Records for the release of their debut album, Moustache. The album was released in the UK, US, Europe and Japan and saw the band tour the world extensively to support it. When Ark21 shut down operation in the UK, their second album Me Too, was released on various independent labels throughout the world. Farrah have maintained their independent status ever since. Recording at their own South London recording studio, producing their own videos and managing their online presence. In addition to developing a harder rock sound, Me Too incorporated more diverse elements into their sound while still remaining true to the lyrically quirky three-minute, harmony-laden, melody- driven power pop sound of Moustache. In late 2006, Farrah completed their third album, Cut Out and Keep. It was released in 2007 in the UK, Spain and Japan and accompanied by a world tour. Since early 2007, Farrah has been working with the Japanese pop rock artist Kaela Kimura. They have so far composed two songs for her, and she has covered their song, \\"No Reason Why\\". One of Japan's leading rock bands, Asian Kung-Fu Generation has invited Farrah to appear at their own Nano-Mugen Festival on two occasions, most recently in 2009. In 2009, they released their self-titled fourth album in Japan. The band now features former Cotton Mather drummer Dana Myzer in its lineup. The album (with a slightly different track listing ) was then released in the rest of the world in May 2010. On 15 November 2011, the band included a cover of Europe's \\"The Final Countdown\\" on Engine Room Recordings compilation album, Guilt by Association Vol. 3. In 2015, he worked with Shane Filan from Irish pop band Westlife for two tracks on the Right Here album, where it charted No. 1 in Irish Albums Chart. In 2018, his co-written track \\"Brave\\" made it on to Steps singer Claire Richards' solo debut album, My Wildest Dreams. Lead vocalist and principal songwriter Jez Ashurst has also written songs recorded by numerous artists including Gabrielle Aplin, Boyzone, Will Young, The Click Five, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Brian McFadden, Hanson, Little Mix and Cliff Richard. Farrah co-founder Andrew Campbell also owns and runs the indie record label Lojinx.

Biography  He studied sciences at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure (Paris), and from 1829 to 1849 was associated with the Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers, first as a professor, and beginning in 1832, an administrator. After the death of Pierre Louis Dulong in 1838, he attained the chair of physics at the Faculty of Sciences.Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers edited by Virginia Trimble, Thomas R. Williams, Katherine Bracher, Richard Jarrell, Jordan D. March√©, F. Jamil Ragep For a brief period of time, he was chair of physics at the √âcole Polytechnique (1831), where he was succeeded by C√©sar Despretz in 1831 and Gabriel Lam√© in 1832.Annuaire de l'Ecole royale polytechnique, Volume 5; Volume 1837 Google Books In 1852 he was compulsorily retired from the Faculty of Sciences because he refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the imperial government that took power in late 1851.  Scientific research  The Pouillet effect was named after the phenomenon that he published in 1822 on the heat produced by the wetting of dry sand. From p. 142: \\"√Ä l'instant o√π un liquide mouille un solide, il y a d√©gagement de chaleur.\\" (At the instant when a liquid wets a solid, there is a release of heat.)Adsorption by Powders and Porous Solids: Principles, Methodology by Jean Rouquerol, Fran√ßoise Rouquerol, Philip Llewellyn, Guillaume Maurin, Kenneth S.W. Sing He developed a pyrheliometer and made, between 1837 and 1838,Solar and Terrestrial Radiation: Methods and Measurements by Kinsell Coulson the first quantitative measurements of the solar constant. His estimate was 1228 W/m2, very close to the current estimate of 1367 W/m2. Using the Dulong-Petit law inappropriately, he estimated the temperature of the Sun's surface to be around 1800 ¬∞C.See: * On p. 36, Pouillet estimates the sun's temperature: \\" ‚Ä¶ cette temp√©rature pourrait √™tre de 1761¬∞ ‚Ä¶ \\" ( ‚Ä¶ this temperature [i.e., of the Sun] could be 1761¬∞ ‚Ä¶ ) * English translation: Pouillet (1838) \\"Memoir on the solar heat, on the radiating and absorbing powers of atmospheric air, and on the temperature of space\\" in: Taylor, Richard, ed.

He published works on optics, electricity, magnetism, meteorology, photography and photometry. In the field of optics he conducted investigations of diffraction phenomena. In his studies of electricity, he designed sine and tangent galvanometers. Pouillet developed and corrected Joseph Fourier's work on the surface temperature of the earth, developing the first real mathematical treatment of the greenhouse effect. He speculated that water vapour and carbon dioxide might trap infrared radiation in the atmosphere, warming the earth enough to support plant and animal life.

His nationally syndicated talk show, The Neal Boortz Show, which ended in 2013, was carried throughout the United States. The content of the show included politics, current events, social issues, and topics of interest, which Boortz discussed with callers, correspondents, and guests. Boortz touched on many controversial topics. Boortz's first involvement with radio was in the 1960s, while he was a student at Texas A&M; University, working as a local on-air personality at WTAW. After moving to Georgia, he became an avid listener of Atlanta's first talk radio station. Boortz became a regular caller to the morning talk show. When the show's host died, it created a job opening, which Boortz actively pursued. He was initially hired on a two-week \\"trial run\\", and later offered the permanent position. Boortz attended night law school, earning a law degree in 1977. For some years he worked as both an attorney and as a talk show host. He eventually closed his law practice to concentrate on his work in radio. Boortz has received many industry accolades. He was named as one of the \\"25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America\\" by Talkers magazine, and one of \\"Georgia's 100 Most Influential People\\" by Georgia Trend. In 2009, Boortz was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame. Boortz's first book was The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear in 1997, followed by The Terrible Truth About Liberals, in 1998. In 2005, he co-wrote The FairTax Book with Congressman John Linder, proposing to implement a variant of a national retail sales tax in lieu of other federal taxes. Boortz's involvement with the FairTax is covered in the documentary film An Inconvenient Tax.  Biography  = Early life and education = Boortz was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, his mother's home. His father was a Marine Corps pilot, who served in World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War. Describing himself as a \\"military brat\\", Boortz lived in many locations throughout the country (including the small community of Thrall, Texas). He spent his first two years of high school at Tustin Union High School in Tustin, California. The family then moved to Florida. Boortz graduated from Pensacola High School, in 1963. He attended Texas A&M; University, but did not graduate. Boortz later attended John Marshall Law School, in Atlanta, Georgia, graduating in 1977 and passing the Georgia bar.  Career path  =Law School and Radio= Boortz and Sean Hannity in 2008 Neal Boortz speaking in Phoenix, Arizona. Boortz began his radio career in College Station, Texas in the 1960s at WTAW, under the name of Randy Neal, while attending Texas A&M; University. In 1967, after leaving Texas, Boortz moved to Atlanta and landed a sales job. For two years he worked at Rich's Department Store, where he sold jewelry and carpeting. He later recollected that one of his customers was Martin Luther King, Jr. During that time, Boortz was an avid listener of AM 680 WRNG (now WCNN). The station called itself \\"Ring Radio,\\" as in the ring of a telephone. It was Atlanta's first talk radio station. Boortz listened to morning talk show host, Herb Elfman, and soon became a devotee. \\"Boortz bombarded Elfman with calls, reading him little scripts he'd scribbled.\\" While watching the news one evening, he heard that Elfman had committed suicide. The next morning, Boortz showed up at the front door of WRNG and announced that he was ready to take Elfman's place. Even though the management told him that \\"they were going to search for a 'qualified' host to take his place,\\" Boortz was offered the role of temporary two-week replacement. In the interim, the evening host was moved to mornings and Boortz hosted the evening time slot. Two weeks later, Boortz was moved to the morning show, embarking on an Atlanta talk radio career that spanned more than forty years. Boortz honed his skills at the tiny 1,000-watt station, and even wrote a few speeches for then Georgia Governor Lester Maddox. He continued working at the station until 1974, when WRNG \\"dumped him.\\" He was offered a job at radio station WGY in Schenectady, New York, but turned the offer down to return to Atlanta and enroll in law school. In 1974, Boortz enrolled in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class in his spare time, while he and his wife Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing \\"the money to keep me in law school.\\" After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team in the aftermath of a failed Subaru car dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine \\"It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared.\\" Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well- being for Evander . ... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an \\"unethical son of a bitch.\\" Boortz later remarked \\"It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control.\\" In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career. = Full Time Radio Career = While in law school, Boortz returned to work at WRNG. In 1983 he moved to the larger news-talk radio station WGST. He later recounted how he would often go into work at his law office at 5 a.m., work there for several hours, then go to WGST, and finally back to the law office until 11:00 p.m. In 1992, Boortz asked WGST for a raise; a salary equal to his combined income as an attorney and a radio host. When WGST refused, Boortz left. He got his raise when he signed an exclusive contract with AM 750 WSB to host a weekday radio show. Shortly after that, he closed his law office. In 1995, Talkers Magazine named Boortz one of the \\"25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America\\". That same year, Georgia Trend magazine added Boortz to its list of the \\"100 Most Powerful & Influential People in Georgia\\" In 1999, his show became nationally syndicated through WSB's owner Cox Radio. The show continued to be based in Atlanta. The Neal Boortz Show featured Boortz, producers Belinda Skelton and Royal Marshall, interviews, and callers. On the air and on his website, Boortz admonished his listeners to take no heed nor place any credence in anything he said, presenting himself as merely an \\"entertainer.\\" As an entertainer, Boortz was a 2002 NAB Marconi Radio Awards finalist and Radio & Records NewsTalk Personality of the Year for 2002. NewsMax.com Magazine's \\"Top 25 Talk Radio Host\\" list selected Boortz as the ninth most influential host in the nation. In 2007, Boortz and his radio show were awarded \\"Best Radio On-Air Personality\\" and \\"Best Radio Program, Any Type\\" by The Georgia Association of Broadcasters. He was also a recipient of the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame 2007 Career Achievement Award.\\"Neal Boortz accepts his award from Pete Spriggs, WSB Program Director\\", www.grhof.com .

His second book, entitled The Terrible Truth About Liberals, was published in 1998, and contains reprinted material from his first book, along with a significant amount of new material. His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal to implement a national retail sales tax in lieu of the federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the New York Times bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks.Matt Kempner, \\"The FairTax Book author from Atlanta is pumping up volume on sales of book.\\" Atlanta Journal-Constitution, August 20, 2005. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. The book is one of his most frequent topics of discussion. His fourth book entitled Somebody's Gotta Say It was released on February 20, 2007, and debuted at #2 spot on the New York Times bestseller list, second only to Barack Obama's Audacity of Hope. He occasionally writes columns on the Internet news/commentary site Townhall.com and other online magazines. His 2008 book is titled FairTax: The Truth. This book attempts to answer the critics of the Fair Tax proposal and claims to correct some of its myths and misrepresentations. It achieved #4 on the New York Times Best Seller list for the week of March 2, 2008 for paperback nonfiction. After Neal retired from talk radio on January 21, 2012, Maybe I Should Just Shut Up and Go Away! (‚Äîthe book is found after clicking the \\"Find this book on Google Books\\" link) was published in hardcover by Carpenter's Son Publishing in Franklin Tennessee.  Political beliefs  Neal Boortz speaks at a FairTax Rally in Orlando, Florida on July 28, 2006 Boortz is a self-described libertarian. He advocates a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax system and the release of all non-violent drug offenders who are currently in prison. He has supported Republican candidates and Republican tax policy, though he occasionally clashes with Republicans on social issues. Others describe his political views as being more in line with \\"republitarian\\" philosophy that embraces incrementalism domestically, and a generally interventionist foreign policy based on self- interest, national defense and the expansion of freedom. Boortz disagrees with the Libertarian Party platform on several key issues including his firm support of the war in Iraq, incremental tax reform, and his opposition to the unrestricted immigration policy advocated by the Libertarian Party. Boortz criticizes the major parties saying \\"I believe that the principal difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats just want to grow our Imperial Federal Government a bit faster than the Republicans do.\\" He sides with liberals on some social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil liberties. He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating less government spending and decreasing corporate regulation. He is an advocate for freedom of speech. In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party, Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs, and emphasizing personal responsibility. He has repeatedly stated his belief that global climate change is not man-made. His stances on many of these issues make him popular among conservative Republicans, who, due to their larger numbers in comparison to Libertarians, make up the majority of his listeners and callers. Boortz's post-9/11 platforms include support for the US-led War on Terror, a more aggressive foreign policy, and the USA Patriot Act. He is also strongly in favor of a crackdown on illegal immigration, including harsh penalties for businesses who employ persons here illegally. These views occasionally put him in conflict with the Libertarian Party. Justin Raimondo of Antiwar.com has called Boortz a \\"statist, not a libertarian\\" and a \\"liberventionist\\" and has urged the Libertarian Party to \\"Boot Boortz\\". Prior to the 2006 midterm elections, Boortz opined that perhaps it would be a good thing to have the Republicans lose power in Congress, forcing them to wake up and stop taking their base for granted. Boortz told one disgruntled caller: > I am happy about it [the defeat]. It's the only way to get these Republicans > to wake themselves up and say, 'You have abandoned what you were put in > office for.' Boortz creates controversy among conservatives for his support of abortion rights (on which Boortz does not allow calls), for his refusal to condemn homosexuality or gay marriage, and for his negative comments regarding Baptists and the biblical story of creation. Although he calls himself a Christian, he keeps his religious views private. He has also caused a stir among some Southerners, by coining the term \\"Flaggots\\" during his frequent jabs at them and at Confederate issues (such as governmental support of the Confederate flag).  The Neal Boortz Show  The Neal Boortz Show was a nationally syndicated talk show, which ended in January 2013. It aired live from 8:30am to noon, weekdays. Boortz marketed his talk radio show as \\"insensitivity training\\", creating controversy which increased ratings. His stated \\"beliefs\\" included a claim that ADD and ADHD are \\"medical frauds\\" and a scam that teachers, parents, and drug companies use. His attempts at controversy included referring to homeless people as \\"urban outdoorsmen\\" on air, and called public education \\"taxpayer-funded child abuse\\". Specific targets of criticism included Christian conservatives, Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Max Cleland, and Cynthia McKinney. He also expressed a negative opinion about the lack of Muslim outrage for the actions of Muslim terrorists and the riots that erupted in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. Islamic extremism was a favorite topic. Some of his remarks caused controversy. After the Virginia Tech shootings, Boortz criticized the media, saying, \\"When the history of this event is written, we will have 25 students standing meekly waiting for this guy to execute them.\\"Steinberg, Jacques.

Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines. Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. As of 2004, Riesling was estimated to be the world's 20th most grown variety at (with an increasing trend),J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition, Oxford University Press 2006, pg. 746: \\"Vine varieties\\", but in terms of importance for quality wines, it is usually included in the \\"top three\\" white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Riesling is a variety which is highly \\"terroir-expressive\\", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is greatly influenced by the wine's place of origin. In cool climates (such as many German wine regions), Riesling wines tend to exhibit apple and tree fruit notes with noticeable levels of acidity that are sometimes balanced with residual sugar. A late- ripening variety that can develop more citrus and peach notes is grown in warmer climates (such as Alsace and parts of Austria). In Australia, Riesling is often noted for a characteristic lime note that tends to emerge in examples from the Clare Valley and Eden Valley in South Australia. Riesling's naturally high acidity and pronounced fruit flavors give wines made from the grape exceptional aging potential, with well-made examples from favorable vintages often developing smokey, honey notes, and aged German Rieslings, in particular, taking on a \\"petrol\\" character.Wine & Spirits Education Trust \\"Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality\\" pgs 6-9, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, In 2015, Riesling was the most grown variety in Germany with 23.0% and ,German Wine Institute: German Wine Statistics 2015-2016 and in the French region of Alsace with 21.9% and .CIVA website, read on September 9, 2007 In Germany, the variety is particularly widely planted in the Mosel, Rheingau, Nahe and Pfalz wine regions. There are also significant plantings of Riesling in Austria, Slovenia, Serbia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Luxembourg, northern Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, China, Ukraine, and the United States (Washington, California, Michigan and New York). History A Kabinett level German Riesling from the Mosel. Riesling has a long history, and there are several written references to the variety dating from the 15th century, although with varying orthography.Freddy Price, Riesling Renaissance Mitchell Beazley 2004, pg. 16-18 The earliest of these references (\\"R√ºssling\\") is from 1402 in the city of Worms, Germany.Wine Atlas of Germany by Dieter Braatz et al., p.178 Another early mention dates from March 13, 1435, when the storage inventory of Count John IV of Katzenelnbogen in R√ºsselsheim (a small principality on the Rhine, close to today's Rheingau) lists \\"22 √ü umb seczreben Rie√ülingen in die wingarten\\" (\\"22 shillings for Riesling vine cuttings for the vineyard\\").http://www.graf-von- katzenelnbogen.de/ The History of the County of Katzenelnbogen and the First Riesling of the WorldWinzerfreunde R√ºsselsheim - facsimile and translation of the 1435 document The spelling Rie√ülingen is repeated in many other documents of the time. The modern spelling Riesling was first documented in 1552 when it was mentioned in Hieronymus Bock's Latin herbal.Oz Clarke, The Encyclopedia of Grapes Websters International Publishers 2001, pg. 192 A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 contains the text zu dem Russelinge, but it is not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling.Freddy Price, Riesling Renaissance Mitchell Beazley 2004, pg. 90-92 In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, there seems to be no documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.Freddy Price, Riesling Renaissance Mitchell Beazley 2004, pg. 118 =Parentage= Earlier, Riesling was sometimes claimed to have originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Wei√üer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is a cross between a wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way. It has also been suggested, but not proved, that the red-skinned version of Riesling is the forerunner of the common, \\"white\\" Riesling.Wein-Plus Glossar: Roter Riesling, accessed on January 23, 2013 The genetic differences between white and red Riesling are minuscule, as is also the case between Pinot noir and Pinot gris. Longevity A German Riesling from the 1975 vintage, an Erbacher Siegelsberg Kabinett from Schloss Reinhartshausen in Rheingau, uncorked at 32 years of age in 2007. It shows the typical golden to amber colour of aged Riesling, which is shared by many other aged white wines. Riesling wines are often consumed when young, when they make a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity.Owen Bird, Rheingold - The German Wine Renaissance, Arima Publishing 2005, pp. 91 However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly.Michael Broadbent, Vintage Wines Little, Brown 2002 pg 343 Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.Jancis Robinson.com: Exploding myths about German wine The townhall of Bremen, Germany, stores various German wines, including Riesling based wines, in barrel back to the 1653 vintage.Michael Broadbent, Vintage Wines Little, Brown 2002 pg 344 More common aging periods for Riesling wines would be 5‚Äì15 years for dry, 10‚Äì20 years for semi-sweet and 10‚Äì30+ for sweet versions.Riesling Report issue #13 March/April 2002, pp. 8-13: The Rewards of Cellaring Riesling = Petroleum notes in aged Riesling wines = On release, certain Riesling wines reveal a striking petrol noteOwen Bird, Rheingold - The German Wine Renaissance, Arima Publishing 2005, pp. 90-97 (go√ªt de p√©trole in French) which is sometimes described with associations to kerosene, lubricant or rubber. While an integral part of the aroma profile of mature Riesling and sought after by many experienced drinkers, it may be off-putting to those unaccustomed to it, and those who primarily seek young and fruity aromas in their wine. The negative attitude to petrol aromas in young Riesling, and the preference for fruitier young wines of this variety, seem more common in Germany than in Alsace or on the export market, and some German producers, especially the volume-oriented ones, have even gone so far as to consider the petrol notes a defect which they try to avoid, even at the cost of producing wines that are less suited to extended cellar aging. In that vein, the German Wine Institute has gone so far as to omit the mentioning of \\"petrol\\" as a possible aroma on their German- language Wine Aroma Wheel, which is supposed to be specially adapted to German wines, and despite the fact that professor Ann C. Noble had included petrol in her original version of the wheel. The petrol note is considered to be caused by the compound 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (TDN),P. Winterhalter, \\"1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (TDN) formation in wine. 1. Studies on the hydrolysis of 2,6,10,10-tetramethyl-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-6-ene-2,8-diol rationalizing the origin of TDN and related C13 norisoprenoids in Riesling wine\\", Journal of agricultural and food chemistry, 1991, vol. 39 (#10), pages 1825-1829, which during the aging process is created from carotenoid precursors by acid hydrolysis. The initial concentration of precursors in the wine determines the wine's potential to develop TDN and petrol notes over time. From what is known of the production of carotenoids in grapes, factors that are likely to increase the TDN potential are: * Ripe grapes, i.e., low yields and late harvest * High sun exposure * Water stress, which is most likely in regions which do not practice irrigation, and there primarily in certain dry vineyard sites in hot and dry years * High acid content These factors are usually also considered to contribute to high quality Riesling wines, so the petrol note is in fact more likely to develop in top wines than in simpler wines made from high-yielding vineyards, especially those from the New World, where irrigation is common. Noble rot A bunch of Riesling grapes after the onset of noble rot. The difference in colour between affected and unaffected grapes is clearly visible. The most expensive wines made from Riesling are late harvest dessert wines, produced by letting the grapes hang on the vines well past normal picking time. Through evaporation caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea (\\"noble rot\\") or by freezing, as in the case of ice wine (in German, Eiswein), water is removed and the resulting wine is felt to offer richer layers on the palate. These concentrated wines have more sugar (in extreme cases hundreds of grams per litre), more acid (to give balance to the sugar), more flavour, and more complexity. These elements combine to make wines which are amongst the most long lived of all white wines. The beneficial use of \\"noble rot\\" in Riesling grapes was discovered in the late 18th century at Schloss Johannisberg. Permission from the Abbey of Fulda (which owned the vineyard) to start picking Riesling grapes arrived too late and the grapes had begun to rot; yet it turned out that the wine made from them was still of excellent quality.History of Schloss Johannisberg Production regions Mosel region. Riesling is considered one of the grape varieties that best expresses the terroir of the place where it is grown.Oz Clarke, The Encyclopedia of Grapes Websters International Publishers 2001, pg. 194 It is particularly well suited for slate and sandy clay soil.Jancis Robinson, Vines, Grapes and Wines Mitchell Beazley 2002 pg 105 =Germany= Today Riesling is Germany‚Äôs leading grape variety, known for its characteristic ‚Äútransparency‚Äù in flavour and presentation of terroir,Andrew Ellson, Roll out the riesling, German wines are making a comeback, in: The Times dated 9 December 2019Wine Spectator Magazine, Wine in Northern Europe September 30th, 2006 pg. 124 and its balance between fruit and mineral flavours. In Germany, Riesling normally ripens between late September and late November, and late harvest Riesling can be picked as late as January. Two common characteristics of German Riesling are that they are rarely blended with other varieties and usually never exposed to oak flavour (despite some vintners fermenting in \\"traditionel\\" old oak barrels already leached). To this last item there is an exception with some vinters in the wine regions of Palatinate (Pfalz) and Baden using new oak aging. The warmer temperatures in those regions produce heavier wines with a higher alcohol content that can better contend with the new oak.Oz Clarke, The Encyclopedia of Grapes Websters International Publishers 2001, pg. 195 While clearer in individual flavours when it is young, a German Riesling will harmonize more as it ages, particularly around ten years of age. In Germany, sugar levels at time of harvest are an important consideration in the wine's production with pr√§dikat levels measuring the sweetness of the wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in expectation of having a higher level of ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.Oz Clarke, The Encyclopedia of Grapes Websters International Publishers 2001, pg. 197 Before technology in wineries could stabilize temperatures, the low temperatures in winter of the northern German regions would halt fermentation and leave the resulting wines with natural sugars and a low alcohol content. According to local tradition, in the Mosel region the wine would then be bottled in tall, tapered, and green hock bottles. Similar bottles, although brown, are used for Riesling produced in the Rhine region.Stuart Walton, Understanding, Choosing and Enjoying Wine Hermes House 2006, pg. 70 Riesling is also the preferred grape in production of Deutscher Sekt, German sparkling wine. Riesling wines from Germany cover a vast array of tastes from sweet to off-dry halbtrocken to dry trocken. Late harvest Rieslings can ripen to become very sweet dessert wines of the beerenauslese (BA) and trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) class. =France= Riesling grapes growing in Alsace. Riesling is on record as being planted in the Alsace region by 1477 when its quality was praised by the Duke of Lorraine.Oz Clarke, The Encyclopedia of Grapes Websters International Publishers 2001, pg. 193 Today over a fifth of Alsace's vineyards are covered with Riesling vines, mostly in the Haut-Rhin district, with the varietal being very different from neighboring German Riesling.Stuart Walton, Understanding, Choosing and Enjoying Wine Hermes House 2006, pg. 74 According to French regulations as of 2011, this variety may only be planted in Moselle, Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin. This is partly from difference in the soil with the clay Alsatian soil being more dominately calcareous than the slate composition of Rheingau. The other differences come in wine making styles, with the Alsatian preferring more French-oriented methods that produce wines of higher alcohol content (normally around 12%) and more roundness due to longer time spent in neutral oak barrels or steel tanks. In contrast to German wine laws, Alsatian rieslings can be chaptalized, a process in which the alcoholic content is increased through the addition of sugar to the must.Oz Clarke, The Encyclopedia of Grapes Websters International Publishers 2001, pg. 198 An Alsatian Riesling. In contrast to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace are usually not meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized S√©lection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine. In addition to Muscat, Gew√ºrztraminer and Pinot gris, Riesling is one of the acceptable varieties whose planting is allowed in Alsace grand cru sites.Stuart Walton, Understanding, Choosing and Enjoying Wine Hermes House 2006, pg. 121 =Australia and New Zealand= Gold lettering on collectible Sydney Opera House wine In 1838 William Macarthur planted Riesling vines near Penrith in New South Wales.Queensland Government Wine Development-Riesling Riesling was the most planted white grape in Australia until the early 1990s when Chardonnay greatly increased in popularity. Riesling still flourishes in The Great Southern (in particular Mt Barker, Frankland River and Porongorup), Clare Valley, in particular the areas of Watervale and around the Polish Hill River, and the cooler Eden Valley and High Eden regions. The warmer Australian climate produces thicker skinned grapes, sometimes seven times the thickness of German grown grape. The grapes ripening in free drain soil composed of red soil over limestone and shale, producing a lean wine that as it matures produces toasty, honeycomb and lime aromas and flavors. It is common for Australian Rieslings to be fermented at low temperatures in stainless steel tanks with no oxidation of the wine and followed by earlier bottling.Oz Clarke, The Encyclopedia of Grapes Websters International Publishers 2001, pg. 199 Australian Rieslings are noted for their oily texture and citrus fruit flavors in their youth and a smooth balance of freshness and acid as they age. The botrytized Rieslings have immense levels of flavor concentrations that have been favorably compared to lemon marmalade.Stuart Walton, Understanding, Choosing and Enjoying Wine Hermes House 2006, pg. 75 Riesling was first planted in New Zealand in the 1970s and has flourished in the relatively cool climate of the Marlborough area and for late harvests in the Nelson region. In comparison to Australian Riesling, New Zealand produces lighter and more delicate wines that range from sweet to dry.Stuart Walton, Understanding, Choosing and Enjoying Wine Hermes House 2006, pg. 71 Home of cool climate wines, Central Otago, has recently emerged as another area producing terroir driven wines. =Austria= Riesling is the second leading white grape varietal after the indigenous Gr√ºner Veltliner.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible Workman Publishing 2001 page 569 Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis. =United States= A Riesling from the Columbia Valley AVA of Washington State. In the late nineteenth century German immigrants brought with them Riesling vines, named Johannisberg Riesling to qualify them as ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù German Riesling. New York, particularly in the Finger Lakes region, was one of the earliest U.S. producers of Riesling. Plantings started to appear in California by 1857 and followed in Washington State in 1871. New York Riesling generally has a characteristic effervescent light body with a similarly light, mellow flavor. The wine can be dynamic though rarely robust, and ranges from dry to sweet. New York is also a notable producer of Riesling- based ice wine, although a large majority of New York Ice Wine is made from Vidal blanc and Vignoles. In California, Riesling lags far behind Chardonnay in popularity and is not as commonly planted. A notable exception is the growing development of high quality Late Harvest dessert wines. So far, the Late Harvest wines most successfully produced are in the Anderson and Alexander Valleys where the weather is more likely to encourage the needed botrytis to develop. The Riesling that does come out of California tends to be softer, fuller, and having more diverse flavours than a \\"typical\\" German Riesling. In the Pacific Northwest there is a stark contrast in Riesling production. The grape is currently on the rise in Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often there will be an easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.A. King \\"Bonny Doon has crush on Washington Riesling\\" pg 26 Wine Press Northwest Spring 2007 In Michigan, whose Old Mission Peninsula and Leelanau Peninsula AVAs (near Traverse City) are known for their ice wine, Riesling is a fairly common variety, in part on account of its suitability for that purpose.Fruit Production 2005, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Michigan Field Office, January 25, 2006, , accessed July 20, 2006http://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?section=features&content;=49688&ftitle;=Michigan%20Ice%20Wine%20Rises%20When%20Mercury%20Falls Riesling is grown in other regions as well, including colder parts of relatively warm states such as Oklahoma (where it has even been made into an eiswein) and Texas. Riesling is also grown throughout all the regions in Ohio and is produced and sold at award-winning wineries across the state. =Canada= In Ontario, Riesling is commonly used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. The founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench. In British Columbia, Riesling is commonly grown for use in Icewine, table wine, and sekt style sparkling wines, a notable example of which is Cipes Brut. In Nova Scotia, particularly in the Annapolis Valley region, Riesling is showing significant promise, being shaped by the warm summer days with cool nights and the extension of the growing season that is being observed. The Maritime climate combined with glacial soils contribute to the interesting expressions that are showing. =Other regions= Riesling is also widely grown in Hungary, Italy, particularly Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Croatia, South Africa, Chile and Central Europe, particularly Romania and Moldova, Serbia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Production A German Sp√§tlese level Riesling from the Mosel. In wine making, the delicate nature of the Riesling grape requires special handling during harvesting to avoid crushing or bruising the skin. Without this care, the broken skins could leak tannin into the juice, giving a markedly coarse taste and throwing off balance the Riesling's range of flavors and aromas. A wine that is best at its \\"freshest\\" states, the grapes and juice may be chilled often throughout the vinification process. Once, right after picking to preserve the grapes' more delicate flavours. Second, after it has been processed through a bladder press and right before fermentation. During fermentation, the wine is cooled in temperature controlled stainless steel fermentation tanks kept between . This differs from red wines that normally ferment at Unlike Chardonnay, most Riesling do not undergo malolactic fermentation. This helps preserve the tart, acidic characteristic of the wine that gives Riesling its \\"thirst-quenching\\" quality. (Producers of Sauvignon blanc and Pinot grigio often avoid malolactic fermentation for the same reason.) Riesling is often put through a process of cold stabilization, where the wine is stored just above its freezing point. The wine is kept at this temperature until much of the tartaric acid has crystallized and precipitated out of the wine. This helps prevent crystallization of the acid (often called \\"wine diamonds\\") in the bottle.Dr. Yair Margalit, Winery Technology & Operations A Handbook for Small Wineries The Wine Appreciation Guild 1996, pg. 89 After this, the wine is normally filtered again to remove any remaining yeast or impurities. In viticulture, the two main components in growing Riesling grapes are to keep it \\"Long & Low\\" meaning that the ideal situation for Riesling is a climate that allows for a long, slow ripening and proper pruning to keep the yield low and the flavor concentrated. With food Riesling is a versatile wine for pairing with food, because of its balance of sugar and acidity. It can be paired with white fish or pork, and is one of the few wines that can stand up to the stronger flavours and spices of Thai and Chinese cuisine.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible Workman Publishing 2001 pg. 554 A Riesling's typical aromas are of flowers, tropical fruits, and mineral stone (such as slate or quartz), although, with time, the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above. Riesling is almost never fermented or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels are often used to store and stabilize Riesling-based wines in Germany and Alsace).\\"Riesling and Germany 2005\\", Andrew Corrigan, eWineconsult.com This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to a wider range of foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings can serve as a good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell. As with other white wines, dry Riesling is generally served at a cool . Sweeter Rieslings are often served warmer. Clones There exists a large number of commercial clones of Riesling, with slightly different properties. In Germany, approximately 60 clones are allowed, and the most famous of these have been propagated from vines in the vineyards of Schloss Johannisberg. Most other countries have sourced their Riesling clones directly from Germany, but they are sometimes propagated under different designations. Red Riesling A very rare version of Riesling which has recently received more attention is Red Riesling (Roter Riesling). As the name suggests, this is a red-skinned clone of Riesling (a skin color commonly found for e.g. Gew√ºrztraminer), but not a dark-skinned clone, i.e., it is still a white wine grape. It is considered a mutation of White Riesling, but some experts have suggested the opposite relationship, i.e., that Red Riesling could be the forerunner of White Riesling. Small amounts of Red Riesling are grown in Germany and Austria. In 2006, the Rheingau winery Fritz Allendorf planted what has been claimed to be the first commercial amounts of Red Riesling.Wein-Plus Magazine September 6, 2006: Allendorf sees red To confuse matters, \\"Red Riesling\\" has also been used as a synonym for red-skinned Traminer grapes (such as the Savagnin rose of Klevener de Heiligenstein) and the obscure variety Hanns, which is a seed plant of Roter Veltliner. Roter Riesling has nothing to do with Schwarzriesling. Crosses In the late 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many efforts to develop new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant characteristics of Riesling. The most notable is the M√ºller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the red wine grape Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.Stuart Walton, Understanding, Choosing and Enjoying Wine Hermes House 2006, pg. 181 The VIVC lists the following crosses with Riesling as the first parent: Alb de Yaloven, Arnsburger, Augustriesling, Beutelriesling, Bouquetriesling, Dalkauer, Edelmuskat, Ehrenfelser, Feinriesling, Floricica, Fr√ºhriesling, Geisenheim 195, Geisenheim 643-10, Geisenheim 643-20, Geisenheim 649, Johanniter, Kocsis Zsuzsa, Manzoni bianco, Marienriesling, M√ºller Thurgau, Multaner, Muscat de la Republique, Naumburg 231-52, Oraniensteiner, Osiris, Osteiner, Quanyu B, Rabaner, Rieslina, Riesling Magaracha, Romeo, Weinsberg S186, Weinsberg S195 And as the second parent: Aris, Arnsburger, Aurelius, Dalmasso 12-40, Dona Emilia, Dr. Deckerrebe, Elbriesling, Freiburg 3-29, Geilweilerhof F.S. 4-208-13, Geilweilerhof Koe-49-81, Geilweilerhof Koe-68-107, Geilweilerhof Koe-70-4, Geilweilerhof Koe-70-96, Geilweilerhof Sbl. 2-19-43, Geisenheim 154, Geisenheim 156, Kamchia, Kerner, Lafayette, Misket Varnenski, Negritienok, President Carnot, Rabaner, Rieslaner, Riesling Bulgarski, Ruling, Thurling, Weinsberg S509, Weinsberg S516, Weinsberg S523, Weinsberg S2630 Naming A bottle of Riesling of Rhein/Rizling rajnski from Northern Croatia Many grapes that incorporate the name Riesling are not true Riesling.

It is located in the Barossa Valley, approximately 70 kilometres north of Adelaide in South Australia.Peter Lehmann Wines In 1977, Saltram instructed then winemaker/manager Peter Lehmann to buy less grapes from their Barossa growers. Since Peter had given the growers his word to buy the grapes, he refused. After months of negotiations with Dalgety plc, which owned Saltram, he was allowed to start an outside company called Masterson Barossa Vineyards in order to buy and process the grapes.Aussie Rules, a guide to Australian wine 2005 Tyre retailer MS Mcleod gave financial backing to the venture. The inspiration of the name came from the legendary gambler Sky Masterson (see Guys and Dolls), because starting the company was such a gamble, and in keeping with the theme the queen of clubs was chosen as the logo for the company. In 1979 Saltram was sold to Canadian multinational spirit producer Seagram which informed Peter that he could no longer make wine on the side, so he quit his job at Saltram and worked fully for Masterson. In 1982 the company was renamed Peter Lehmann Wines. In 1992 MS Mcleod decided to divest themselves of their investment in the company, and with no local buyer in the offing and the company again facing closure or a fire sale to a multinational, a public float was devised. While the core shareholding was intended to be taken up by the growers themselves and by staff, it was feared that the capital raised would be insufficient and so a share and option package was offered publicly. In the end the float was oversubscribed and the new company performed strongly. In late 2003 'PLW' became the subject of a heated bidding war between UK-based Allied Domecq and Swiss based Hess Group. Allied Domecq had acquired 14.5% of Peter Lehmann Wines when it first submitted a takeover bid on 22 September. Peter Lehmann and the board of directors countered by recommending sale to the Hess Group instead. Hess matched the Allied Domecq offer, adding a special dividend to the deal, and purchased the company for a market valuation of $103 million USD.J.

This surface is extended through the continents (such as with very narrow hypothetical canals). According to Gauss, who first described it, it is the \\"mathematical figure of the Earth\\", a smooth but irregular surface whose shape results from the uneven distribution of mass within and on the surface of Earth. It can be known only through extensive gravitational measurements and calculations. Despite being an important concept for almost 200 years in the history of geodesy and geophysics, it has been defined to high precision only since advances in satellite geodesy in the late 20th century. All points on a geoid surface have the same effective potential (the sum of gravitational potential energy and centrifugal potential energy). The force of gravity acts everywhere perpendicular to the geoid, meaning that plumb lines point perpendicular and water levels parallel to the geoid if only gravity and rotational acceleration were at work. The surface of the geoid is higher than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a positive gravity anomaly (mass excess) and lower than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a negative gravity anomaly (mass deficit). Geoid undulation in false color, shaded relief and vertical exaggeration (10000 scale factor). Geoid undulation in false color, to scale. Description thumb1. Ocean 2\\\\. Reference ellipsoid 3\\\\. Local plumb line 4\\\\. Continent 5\\\\. Geoid The geoid surface is irregular, unlike the reference ellipsoid (which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical Earth), but is considerably smoother than Earth's physical surface. Although the physical Earth has excursions of +8,848 m (Mount Everest) and ‚àí11,034 m (Marianas Trench), the geoid's deviation from an ellipsoid ranges from +85 m (Iceland) to ‚àí106 m (southern India), less than 200 m total. If the ocean were isopycnic (of constant density) and undisturbed by tides, currents or weather, its surface would resemble the geoid. The permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography. If the continental land masses were crisscrossed by a series of tunnels or canals, the sea level in those canals would also very nearly coincide with the geoid. In reality, the geoid does not have a physical meaning under the continents, but geodesists are able to derive the heights of continental points above this imaginary, yet physically defined, surface by spirit leveling. Being an equipotential surface, the geoid is, by definition, a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular. That means that when traveling by ship, one does not notice the undulations of the geoid; the local vertical (plumb line) is always perpendicular to the geoid and the local horizon tangential to it. Likewise, spirit levels will always be parallel to the geoid. On a long voyage, spirit leveling indicates height variations even though the ship is always at sea level (neglecting the effects of tides). That is because GPS satellites, orbiting about the center of gravity of the Earth, can measure heights only relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid. To obtain one's geoidal height, a raw GPS reading must be corrected. Conversely, height determined by spirit leveling from a tidal measurement station, as in traditional land surveying, is always geoidal height. Modern GPS receivers have a grid implemented in the source of the geoid (e.g. EGM-96) height over the World Geodetic System (WGS) ellipsoid from the current position. Then, they are able to correct the height above WGS ellipsoid to the height above EGM96 geoid. When height is not zero on a ship, the discrepancy is caused by other factors such as ocean tides, atmospheric pressure (meteorological effects) and local sea surface topography. =Simplified example= The gravitational field of the earth is not uniform. An oblate spheroid is typically used as the idealized earth, but even if the earth were perfectly spherical, the strength of gravity would not be the same everywhere, because density (and therefore mass) varies throughout the planet. This is due to magma distributions, mountain ranges, deep sea trenches, and so on. If that perfect sphere were then covered in water, the water would not be the same height everywhere. Instead, the water level would be higher or lower depending on the particular strength of gravity in that location. Undulation Undulation of the geoid is the height of the geoid relative to a given ellipsoid of reference. The undulation is not standardized, as different countries use different mean sea levels as reference, but most commonly refers to the EGM96 geoid. Map of the undulation of the geoid in meters (based on the EGM96 gravity model and the WGS84 reference ellipsoid). =Relationship to GPS/GNSS= In maps and common use the height over the mean sea level (such as orthometric height) is used to indicate the height of elevations while the ellipsoidal height results from the GPS system and similar GNSS. The deviation N between the ellipsoidal height h and the orthometric height H can be calculated by :N=h-H Likewise, the deviation \\\\zeta between the ellipsoidal height h and the normal height H_N can be calculated by :\\\\zeta=h-H_N Spherical harmonics representation Geoid undulation relative to the reference ellipsoid. Spherical harmonics are often used to approximate the shape of the geoid. The current best such set of spherical harmonic coefficients is EGM96 (Earth Gravity Model 1996), determined in an international collaborative project led by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (now the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or NGA). The mathematical description of the non-rotating part of the potential function in this model is: : V=\\\\frac{GM}{r}\\\\left(1+{\\\\sum_{n=2}^{n_\\\\text{max}}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{r}\\\\right)^n{\\\\sum_{m=0}^n} \\\\overline{P}_{nm}(\\\\sin\\\\phi)\\\\left[\\\\overline{C}_{nm}\\\\cos m\\\\lambda+\\\\overline{S}_{nm}\\\\sin m\\\\lambda\\\\right]\\\\right), where \\\\phi\\\\ and \\\\lambda\\\\ are geocentric (spherical) latitude and longitude respectively, \\\\overline{P}_{nm} are the fully normalized associated Legendre polynomials of degree n\\\\ and order m\\\\ , and \\\\overline{C}_{nm} and \\\\overline{S}_{nm} are the numerical coefficients of the model based on measured data. Note that the above equation describes the Earth's gravitational potential V\\\\ , not the geoid itself, at location \\\\phi,\\\\;\\\\lambda,\\\\;r,\\\\ the co-ordinate r\\\\ being the geocentric radius, i.e., distance from the Earth's centre. The geoid is a particular equipotential surface, and is somewhat involved to compute. The gradient of this potential also provides a model of the gravitational acceleration. EGM96 contains a full set of coefficients to degree and order 360 (i.e. n_\\\\text{max} = 360), describing details in the global geoid as small as 55 km (or 110 km, depending on your definition of resolution). The number of coefficients, \\\\overline{C}_{nm} and \\\\overline{S}_{nm}, can be determined by first observing in the equation for V that for a specific value of n there are two coefficients for every value of m except for m = 0. There is only one coefficient when m=0 since \\\\sin (0\\\\lambda) = 0. There are thus (2n+1) coefficients for every value of n. Using these facts and the formula, \\\\sum_{I=1}^{L}I = L(L+1)/2, it follows that the total number of coefficients is given by : \\\\sum_{n=2}^{n_\\\\text{max}}(2n+1) = n_\\\\text{max}(n_\\\\text{max}+1) + n_\\\\text{max} - 3 = 130317 using the EGM96 value of n_\\\\text{max} = 360 . For many applications the complete series is unnecessarily complex and is truncated after a few (perhaps several dozen) terms. New even higher resolution models are currently under development. For example, many of the authors of EGM96 are working on an updated model that should incorporate much of the new satellite gravity data (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment), and should support up to degree and order 2160 (1/6 of a degree, requiring over 4 million coefficients).Pavlis, N.K., S.A. Holmes. S. Kenyon, D. Schmit, R. Trimmer, \\"Gravitational potential expansion to degree 2160\\", IAG International Symposium, gravity, geoid and Space Mission GGSM2004, Porto, Portugal, 2004. The NGA has announced the availability of EGM2008, complete to spherical harmonic degree and order 2159, and contains additional coefficients extending to degree 2190 and order 2159. Software and data is on the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) - WGS 84 Version] page. Determination Calculating the undulation is mathematically challenging. This is why many handheld GPS receivers have built-in undulation lookup tables to determine the height above sea level. The precise geoid solution by Van√≠ƒçek and co-workers improved on the Stokesian approach to geoid computation. Their solution enables millimetre-to-centimetre accuracy in geoid computation, an order-of- magnitude improvement from previous classical solutions. Geoid undulations display uncertainties which can be estimated by using several methods, e.g. least-squares collocation (LSC), fuzzy logic, artificial neutral networks, radial basis functions (RBF), and geostatistical techniques. Geostatistical approach has been defined as the most improved technique in prediction of geoid undulation. Anomalies Gravity and Geoid anomalies caused by various crustal and lithospheric thickness changes relative to a reference configuration. All settings are under local isostatic compensation. Variations in the height of the geoidal surface are related to density anomalous distributions within the Earth. Geoid measures thus help understanding the internal structure of the planet. Synthetic calculations show that the geoidal signature of a thickened crust (for example, in orogenic belts produced by continental collision) is positive, opposite to what should be expected if the thickening affects the entire lithosphere. Mantle convection also changes the shape of the geoid over time.Richards, M. A., and B. H. Hager, 1984. Geoid anomalies in a dynamic mantle, J. Geophys. Res., 89, 5987‚Äì6002, doi:10.1029/JB089iB07p05987. gravity anomalies in units of Gal., using pseudo color and shaded relief with vertical exaggeration. Time- variability Recent satellite missions, such as the Gravity Field and Steady- State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) and GRACE, have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals. The first products based on GOCE satellite data became available online in June 2010, through the European Space Agency (ESA)‚Äôs Earth observation user services tools. ESA launched the satellite in March 2009 on a mission to map Earth's gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution. On 31 March 2011, the new geoid model was unveiled at the Fourth International GOCE User Workshop hosted at the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. Studies using the time-variable geoid computed from GRACE data have provided information on global hydrologic cycles, mass balances of ice sheets, and postglacial rebound. From postglacial rebound measurements, time-variable GRACE data can be used to deduce the viscosity of Earth's mantle. Other celestial bodies The concept of the geoid has been extended to other planets and also moons, as well as asteroids. The areoid (the geoid of Mars) has been measured using flight paths of satellite missions such as Mariner 9 and Viking. The main departures from the ellipsoid expected of an ideal fluid are from the Tharsis volcanic plateau, a continent-size region of elevated terrain, and its antipodes.

Geography Named for the river that stretches much of its length, the Shenandoah Valley encompasses eight counties in Virginia and two counties in West Virginia. * Augusta County, Virginia * Clarke County, Virginia * Frederick County, Virginia * Page County, Virginia * Rockbridge County, Virginia * Rockingham County, Virginia * Shenandoah County, Virginia * Warren County, Virginia * Berkeley County, West Virginia * Jefferson County, West Virginia The antebellum composition included four additional counties that are now in West Virginia as well as four additional Virginia counties.Sheehan-Dean, Aaron, Why Confederates Fought, Family and Nation in Civil War Virginia, Univ. of North Carolina Press, 2007, pg. 26 * Morgan County, West Virginia * Hampshire County, West Virginia * Hardy County, West Virginia * Pendleton County, West Virginia * Botetourt County, Virginia * Alleghany County, Virginia * Bath County, Virginia * Highland County, Virginia The cultural region includes five more counties in Virginia: * Highland County * Bath County * Alleghany County * Botetourt County * Roanoke County Between the Roanoke Valley in the south and Harpers Ferry in the north, where the Shenandoah River joins the Potomac, the Valley cultural region contains 10 independent cities: * Winchester * Harrisonburg * Waynesboro * Staunton * Lexington * Buena Vista * Covington * Roanoke * Salem The central section of the Shenandoah Valley is split in half by the Massanutten Mountain range, with the smaller associated Page Valley lying to its east and the Fort Valley within the mountain range. =Notable caves= The Shenandoah Valley contains a number of geologically and historically significant limestone caves: * Skyline Caverns * Luray Caverns, designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974 * Shenandoah Caverns * Endless Caverns * Grand Caverns, designated a National Natural Landmark in 1973 * Dixie Caverns Etymology The word Shenandoah is of unknown Native American origin. It has been described as being derived from the Anglicization of Native American terms, resulting in words such as Gerando, Gerundo, Genantua, Shendo and Sherando. The meaning of these words is of some question. Schin- han-dowi, the \\"River Through the Spruces\\"; On-an-da-goa, the \\"River of High Mountains\\" or \\"Silver-Water\\"; and an Iroquois word for \\"Big Meadow\\", have all been proposed by Native American etymologists. The most popular, romanticized belief is that the name comes from a Native American expression for \\"Beautiful Daughter of the Stars\\".Julia Davis, \\"The Shenandoah\\", Rivers of America, New York: Farrar & Rinehart, Inc., 1945, pp. 20‚Äì21 Another legend relates that the name is derived from the name of the Iroquoian chief Sherando (Sherando was also the name of his people), who fought against the Algonquian Chief Opechancanough, ruler of the Powhatan Confederacy (1618‚Äì1644). Opechancanough liked the interior country so much that he sent his son Sheewa-a-nee from the Tidewater with a large party to colonize the valley. Sheewa-a-nee drove Sherando back to his former territory near the Great Lakes. According to this account, descendants of Sheewanee's party became the Shawnee. According to tradition, another branch of Iroquoians, the Senedo, lived in present-day Shenandoah County. They were exterminated by \\"Southern Indians\\" (Catawba or Cherokee) before the arrival of white settlers.Carrie Hunter Willis and Etta Belle Walker, 1937, Legends of the Skyline Drive and the Great Valley of Virginia, pp. 15‚Äì16.Doddridge, p. 31. Another story dates to the American Revolutionary War. Throughout the war, Chief Skenandoa of the Oneida, an Iroquois nation based in New York, persuaded many of the tribe to side with the colonials against the British. Four Iroquois nations became British allies, and caused many fatalities and damage in the frontier settlements west of Albany. Skenandoa led 250 warriors against the British and Iroquois allies. According to Oneida oral tradition, during the harsh winter of 1777‚Äì1778 at Valley Forge, where the colonials suffered, Chief Skenando provided aid to the soldiers. The Oneida delivered bushels of dry corn to the troops to help them survive. Polly Cooper, an Oneida woman, stayed some time with the troops to teach them how to cook the corn properly and care for the sick. General Washington gave her a shawl in thanks, which is displayed at Shako:wi, the museum of the Oneida Nation near Syracuse, New York. Many Oneida believe that after the war, George Washington named the Shenandoah River and valley after his ally.\\"Cultural Heritage: American Revolution\\", 5 July 2010, Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin\\"The Revolutionary War\\", 5 July 2010, Oneida Indian Nation History Shenandoah Valley, oil on canvas, William Louis Sonntag, Sr., 1859‚Äì1860. Virginia Historical Society =First European explorers= Despite the valley's potential for productive farmland, colonial settlement from the east was long delayed by the barrier of the Blue Ridge Mountains. These were crossed by explorers John Lederer at Manassas Gap in 1671, Batts and Fallam the same year, and Cadwallader Jones in 1682. The Swiss Franz Ludwig Michel and Christoph von Graffenried explored and mapped the Valley in 1706 and 1712, respectively. Von Graffenried reported that the Indians of Senantona (Shenandoah) had been alarmed by news of the recent Tuscarora War in North Carolina. =18th century= Governor Alexander Spotswood's legendary Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition of 1716 crossed the Blue Ridge at Swift Run Gap and reached the river at Elkton, Virginia. Settlers did not immediately follow, but someone who heard the reports and later became the first permanent settler in the Valley was Adam Miller (Mueller), who in 1727 staked out claims on the south fork of the Shenandoah River, near the line that now divides Rockingham County from Page County.John W. Wayland, Ph.D., 1912, A History of Rockingham County, Virginia p. 33‚Äì37 The Great Wagon Road (later called the Valley Pike or Valley Turnpike) began as the Great Warriors Trail or Indian Road, a Native road through common hunting grounds shared by several tribes settled around the periphery, which included Iroquoian, Siouan and Algonquian-language family tribes. Known native settlements within the Valley were few, but included the Shawnee occupying the region around Winchester, and Tuscarora around what is now Martinsburg, West Virginia. In the late 1720s and 1730s, Quakers and Mennonites began to move in from Pennsylvania. They were tolerated by the natives, while \\"Long Knives\\" (English settlers from coastal Virginia colony) were less welcomed. During these same decades, the valley route continued to be used by war parties of Seneca (Iroquois) and Lenape en route from New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to attack the distant Catawba in the Carolinas, with whom they were at war. The Catawba in turn pursued the war parties northward, often overtaking them by the time they reached the Potomac. Several fierce battles were fought among the warring nations in the Valley region, as attested by the earliest European-American settlers.Joseph Doddridge, 1850, A History of the Valley of Virginia p. 1‚Äì46 Later colonists called this route the Great Wagon Road; it became the major thoroughfare for immigrants' moving by wagons from Pennsylvania and northern Virginia into the backcountry of the South. The Valley Turnpike Company improved the road by paving it with macadam prior to the Civil War and set up toll gates to collect fees to pay for the improvements. After the advent of motor vehicles, the road was refined and paved appropriately for their use. In the 20th century, the road was acquired by the Commonwealth of Virginia, which incorporated it into the state highway system as U.S. Route 11. For much of its length, the newer Interstate 81, constructed in the 1960s, parallels the old Valley Pike. Along with the first German settlers, known as \\"Shenandoah Deitsch\\", many Scotch-Irish immigrants came south in the 1730s from Pennsylvania into the valley, via the Potomac River. The Scotch-Irish comprised the largest group of non-English immigrants from the British Isles before the Revolutionary War, and most migrated into the backcountry of the South.David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.605‚Äì608 This was in contrast to the chiefly English immigrants who had settled the Virginia Tidewater and Carolina Piedmont regions. Governor Spotswood had arranged the Treaty of Albany with the Iroquois (Six Nations) in 1721, whereby they had agreed not to come east of the Blue Ridge in their raiding parties on tribes farther to the South. In 1736, the Iroquois began to object, claiming that they still legally owned the land to the west of the Blue Ridge; this led to a skirmish with Valley settlers in 1743. The Iroquois were on the verge of declaring war on the Virginia Colony as a result, when Governor Gooch paid them the sum of 100 pounds sterling for any settled land in the Valley that was claimed by them. The following year at the Treaty of Lancaster, the Iroquois sold all their remaining claim to the Valley for 200 pounds in gold.Joseph Solomon Walton, 1900, Conrad Weiser and the Indian Policy of Colonial Pennsylvania p. 76-121. The few Shawnees who still resided in the Valley abruptly headed westward in 1754, having been approached the year before by emissaries from their kindred beyond the Alleghenies.Doddridge, p.44‚Äì45 =19th century= The Shenandoah Valley was known as the breadbasket of the Confederacy during the Civil War and was seen as a backdoor for Confederate raids on Maryland, Washington, and Pennsylvania. Because of its strategic importance it was the scene of three major campaigns. The first was the Valley Campaign of 1862, in which Confederate General Stonewall Jackson defended the valley against three numerically superior Union armies. The final two were the Valley Campaigns of 1864. First, in the summer of 1864, Confederate General Jubal Early cleared the valley of its Union occupiers and then proceeded to raid Maryland, Pennsylvania, and D.C. Then during the autumn, Union General Philip Sheridan was sent to drive Early from the valley and once-and-for-all destroy its use to the Confederates by putting it to the torch using scorched-earth tactics. The valley, especially in the lower northern section, was also the scene of bitter partisan fighting as the region's inhabitants were deeply divided over loyalties, and Confederate partisan John Mosby and his Rangers frequently operated in the area. =20th century= A series of newspaper mergers, ending in 1914, established the Daily News-Record of Harrisonburg as the daily newspaper of the Shenandoah Valley. In the late 20th century, the valley's vineyards began to reach maturity. They constituted the new industry of the Shenandoah Valley American Viticultural Area. =21st century= In 2018, a series of strikes and protests were held in Dayton's Cargill plant. Transportation Transportation in the Shenandoah Valley consists mainly of road and rail and contains several metropolitan area transit authorities. The main north-south road transportation is Interstate 81, which parallels the old Valley Turnpike (U.S. Route 11) and the ancient Great Path of the Native Americans through its course in the valley. In the lower (northern) valley, on the eastern side, U.S. Route 340 also runs north-south, starting from Waynesboro in the south, running through the Page Valley to Front Royal, and on to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, where it exits the valley into Maryland. Major east-west roads cross the valley as well, providing access to the Piedmont and the Allegheny Mountains. Starting from the north, these routes include U.S. Route 50, U.S. Route 522, Interstate 66, U.S. Route 33, U.S. Route 250, Interstate 64, and U.S. Route 60. CSX Transportation operates several rail lines through the valley, including the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the old Manassas Gap Railroad and the old Virginia Central Railroad. There are also more modern lines that run the length of the valley parallel to the Valley Pike and U.S. 340. The rail lines are primarily used for freight transportation, though Maryland Area Rail Commuter (MARC) trains utilize the old B&O; line from stations in Martinsburg, Duffields, and Harper's Ferry to Washington Union Station and vice versa. Several localities in the valley operate public transportation systems, including Front Royal Area Transit (FRAT), which provides weekday transit for the town of Front Royal; Page County Transit, providing weekday transit for the town of Luray and weekday service between Luray and Front Royal; and Winchester Transit, which provides weekday transit for the city of Winchester. In addition, Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus Service offers weekday commuter bus service from the northern Shenandoah Valley, including Shenandoah County and Warren County, to Northern Virginia (Arlington County and Fairfax County) and Washington. Origination points in Shenandoah County include Woodstock. Origination points in Warren County include Front Royal and Linden. In popular culture The Shenandoah Valley serves as the setting for the 1965 film Shenandoah and its 1974 musical adaptation. Both stories follow the Anderson family during the Civil War. An associated song by James Stewart titled \\"The Legend of Shenandoah\\" was a very minor hit in 1965, reaching #133 on the Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart. One of the most famous cultural references to the area does not mention the valley itself ‚Äî West Virginia's state song, \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\" by John Denver, simply contains the words \\"Shenandoah River\\" in the first verse. It is also featured in the fifth season of The 100.

For example, in English, the job title stewardess implies that the person is female. A gender-neutral job title, on the other hand, is one that does not specify or imply gender, such as firefighter or lawyer. In some cases it may be debatable whether a title is gender-specific; for example, chairman appears to denote a male (because of the ending -man), but the title is also applied sometimes to women. Proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the use of gender-neutral job titles, particularly in contexts where the gender of the person in question is not known or not specified. For example, they prefer flight attendant to stewardess or steward, and police officer to policeman or policewoman. In some cases this may involve deprecating the use of certain specifically female titles (such as authoress), thus encouraging the use of the corresponding unmarked form (such as author) as a fully gender-neutral title. The above applies to gender neutrality in English and in some other languages without grammatical gender (where grammatical gender is a feature of a language's grammar that requires every noun to be placed in one of several classes, often including feminine and masculine). In languages with grammatical gender, the situation is altered by the fact that nouns for people are often constrained to be inherently masculine or feminine, and the production of truly gender- neutral titles may not be possible. In such cases, proponents of gender- neutral language may instead focus on ensuring that feminine and masculine words exist for every job, and that they are treated with equal status. Examples The suffix -man had the meaning \\"person\\" in Old English (see man), but in present-day English it is predominantly masculine. Thus job titles that include this suffix, such as fireman, salesman and alderman, generally imply that the holder is male. While some of these job titles have feminine variants (e.g. alderwoman), others do not, because traditionally the positions in question were not occupied by women.Aarts, Bas and April M. S. McMahon. The Handbook of English Linguistics. Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell Pub., 2006, , p. 737. For most such titles, gender-neutral equivalents now also exist, such as police officer (for policeman or policewoman), salesperson or sales representative (for salesman or saleswoman), etc. However, some proposed gender-neutral terms have not attained such common usage (as with fisher as an alternative to fisherman). Military ranks with the suffix -man normally remain unchanged when applied to females: for example, a woman serving in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers might be known as Craftsman Atkins. Examining the TIME magazine corpus (texts from the 1920s to the 2000s), researcher Maria Bovin found: In the case of chairman, gender- neutral alternatives (such as chair and chairperson) exist, although in some contexts the word chairman is used even where it denotes (or could denote) a woman. For details, see Chairman. Feminine terms such as actress, usherette and comedienne are marked with respect to the masculine (actor, usher, comedian) both formally (i.e. something is added to the masculine form) and in the sense that only the masculine form can be used generically to describe a mixed-gender group of people. This means that the \\"masculine\\" form can in fact serve as a gender-neutral term (a solution often favored by proponents of gender-neutral language, who thus tend to deprecate or restrict usage of the specifically feminine forms). Some such feminine forms, such as poetess and authoress, are now rarely used. Others, such as actress, remain common, although increasing numbers of women are calling themselves actors rather than actresses, especially in the live theatre. The Screen Actors Guild annually gives out awards for \\"Best Male Actor\\" and \\"Best Female Actor\\". The term waiter appears to retain masculine specificity (with waitress as the corresponding feminine term). Other gender-neutral terms have therefore been proposed, such as server (alternatives include waitron, waitstaff or waitperson), though these are rarely used outside North America. The term midwife looks superficially to be feminine (since it ends with -wife), but it is used for either gender. The term comes from an Old English term meaning \\"with the woman\\". In an examination of \\"business-related titles\\" such as businessman and business people, \\"overall usage of these terms seems to have decreased since the 1960s\\" when examining TIME Magazine: When \\"looking specifically at the difference between the gender-marked titles and the gender-neutral ones, businessperson(s) and businesspeople, there has been an increase usage of the neutral businesspeople (if all spelling variations are included). Yet, this is not a large increase, and as it is used to refer to a group of people rather than an individual, its relevance may be questionable. Noticeable is the fact that businessperson is remarkably infrequent, and only appears in three decades. The term businesswoman may be increasing again between the 1980s and the 2000s, after a lower usage in the preceding fifty years. It has its highest frequency of usage in the 1920s.http://www.diva- portal.org/smash/get/diva2:934656/FULLTEXT01.pdf\\" Origin of the word master finds it to be \\"late Old English\\": \\"a man having control or authority; a teacher or tutor,\\" from Latin magister (n.), a contrastive adjective (\\"he who is greater\\") meaning \\"chief, head, director, teacher\\", and the source of Old French maistre, French ma√Ætre, Spanish and Italian maestro, Portuguese mestre, Dutch meester, German Meister.https://www.etymonline.com/word/master \\"Garner‚Äôs Usage Tip of the Day\\" states, in regards to \\"layman; layperson; lay person\\", that \\"‚ÄúLayman‚Äù is the most common among these terms and is commonly regarded as unexceptionable ‚Äî in reference to members of both sexes, of course.\\" https://www.lawprose.org/garners-usage-tip-of-the-day-layman-layperson-lay- person/ Debate A change to gender-neutral job titles can be controversial. This debate reflects the debate over gender-neutral language in general. The case for switching to gender-neutral job titles usually makes an ideological argument, that gender-specific job titles at some level promote sexism in the workplace. For example, fire chiefs have argued that when the public uses the term \\"fireman\\" instead of \\"firefighter\\", it reinforces the popular image that firefighting is only a job for men, and thus makes it difficult for them to recruit women. The case for the more traditional, gender-specific terms is usually a practical argument, that replacing the historical terms everywhere they appear (in documents, etc.) would be difficult and expensive, or that it is unnecessary. However, there are many (in particular feminists) who would claim that this argument is really a backlash against the argument for gender- neutral language. There is much difficulty in resolving this debate, as in the case of gender-neutral language in general; however there is at least one difference. Whereas in the general case, there is often no appropriate singular gender-neutral replacement (e.g. the third person singular pronoun he, although the use of singular they is increasingly common), there are gender-neutral versions of nearly all job titles. During the 19th century, attempts to overlay Latin grammar rules onto English required the use of feminine endings in nouns ending with -or. This produced words like doctress and professoress and even lawyeress, all of which have fallen out of use; though waitress, stewardess, and actress are in modern use. Use of the term chairman remains widespread in predominantly male sectors of society, but chairperson or chair is now widespread in society in general, at least in the US, Canada and increasingly in the U.K.American Heritage Dictionary For example, the boards of most Fortune 500 companies in the United States are presided over by a \\"chairman\\" and also the overwhelming majority of the (FTSE 100) companies in the United Kingdom have a \\"chairman\\", while committees in the United States House of Representatives are presided over by a \\"chair\\", as of 2009.House language becomes gender neutral Since most of these are, however, men, a more correct description of the current language situation needs to consider use in organisations whose chairperson is a woman. Less than half of the members of the American Heritage Dictionary's usage panel accept the use of the word chairman in describing a woman.\\"Only 48 percent (43 percent of the women and 50 percent of the men) accept the use of the word in Emily Owen, chairman of the Mayor's Task Force, issued a statement assuring residents that their views would be solicited.\\" Some usage guides, such as The Cambridge Guide to English Usage, advocate gender-neutral language in circumstances where all sexes are meant to be included. For instance, a business might advertise that it is looking for a new chair or chairperson rather than chairman. Gender-neutral language proscribes chairman, on the grounds that some readers would assume women and those of other genders are implicitly excluded from responding to an advertisement using this word.The Cambridge Guide to English Usage pp 243,4 Generally accepted writing conventions Proponents of gender-neutral job titles believe that such titles should be used, especially when referring to hypothetical persons. For example, firefighter instead of fireman; mail carrier, letter carrier, or post worker rather than mailman; flight attendant instead of steward or stewardess; bartender instead of barman or barmaid. In the rare case where no useful gender-neutral alternative is available, they believe both male and female terms should be used. Proponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of a neuter form when/where appropriate. For example, a company may seek to fill a vacancy and hire a new chairperson. Since a gendered individual doesn't currently hold the position, its title reverts to a neuter form. Once that position is filled, many advocates believe gender can be attached to the title as appropriate (chairman or chairwoman). Sometimes this formulation can lead to inconsistent gender-specific usage, in which women become chairpersons but men remain chairmen. Some women opt to use the word chairman in preference to chairwoman, subject to the style Madam or Mister prefixing the title, which they perceive to be gender-neutral by itself. Particularly in academia, the word Chair is often used to designate the person chosen to oversee the agenda at meetings of an organized group. The principle of gender-neutral language dictates that job titles that add suffixes to make them feminine should be avoided. For example, \\"usher\\", not \\"usherette\\"; \\"comedian\\", not \\"comedienne\\". Some of these are almost entirely obsolete now, such as sculptress, poetess, and aviatrix. If gender is relevant, the words woman or female should be used instead of \\"lady\\" (\\"my grandmother was the first female doctor in the province\\"), except if the masculine is \\"lord\\" (as in \\"landlady\\"). In the case of landlord or landlady, it may be preferable to find an equivalent title with the same meaning, such as proprietor or lessor. However, when a female is in the office of \\"the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,\\" it is changed to \\"the Lady Usher of the Black Rod\\" in Canada. Advisors on non-sexist usage deprecate terms such as \\"male nurse\\", \\"female doctor\\", \\"male model\\", or \\"female judge\\" because such terms are often used when the gender is irrelevant. These advisors say that the statement of exception reinforces harmful assumptions about the gender of people in those professions.Gender-Inclusive Language - The Writing Center, UNC Chapel Hill Languages other than English When words have a grammatical gender associated with them, in many languages, they may impose morphological requirements to maintain sentence agreement. That is, there is a non-political content to the word changes, or inflection. Nevertheless, gender-identification word endings are sometimes dropped, something that happened often in the former East Germany, for example.Review of: Mary Fulbrook. The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005. 352 pp. . Sometimes an entirely new or etymologically unrelated word is coined. For example, when men in France wanted to become midwives, up till then an exclusively female occupation, they chose not to adapt the existing term sage-femme (\\"wise woman\\"), and instead coined ma√Øeuticien.

It lies on Finham Brook, a tributary of the River Sowe, which joins the River Avon about north-east of the town centre. The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 22,413. The town is noted architecturally for the extensive ruins of Kenilworth Castle, the ruins of Kenilworth Abbey in Abbey Fields park, St Nicholas's Parish Church, and the town's clock tower. History Kenilworth Castle A settlement existed at Kenilworth by the time of the 1086 Domesday Book, which records it as Chinewrde, meaning \\"farm of a woman named Cynehild\\". Geoffrey de Clinton (died 1134) initiated the building of an Augustinian priory in 1122, which coincided with his initiation of Kenilworth Castle.English Heritage. Retrieved 10 November 2018. The priory was raised to the rank of an abbey in 1450 and suppressed with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s. Thereafter, the abbey grounds next to the castle were made common land in exchange for what Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester used to enlarge the castle. Only a few walls and a storage barn of the original abbey survive. Abbey Fields Just off Coventry Road in Kenilworth is a field called Parliament Piece. This may be where Henry III held a Parliament in August 1266, while his troops besieged Kenilworth Castle, where the late Simon de Montfort's followers, led by Henry de Hastings, were still holding out against the king's forces. This Parliament led to the Dictum of Kenilworth: a settlement that offered the rebels a way of recovering the lands that the Crown had seized from them. One copy of the Dictum is endorsed in castris apud Kenilworth ‚Äî \\"in the camp (or castle) at Kenilworth\\". Members of the public have free access to Parliament Piece, which is owned by the Open Spaces Society and leased to Warwick District Council. Geoffrey de Clinton had a deer park created near Kenilworth. In 1488 Ralph, abbot of Kenilworth Abbey had of land near Redfern, north-west of the town, emparked as Duck Park, which despite its name was a deer park. By about 1540 there were eight deer parks near Kenilworth. Another near Rudfen was a park that was called Little Park in 1581. It was owned by Robert Briscoe in 1649 and was still called Briscoe's Park in 1785. One of the eight deer parks, The Chase, can still be traced. The eastern part of its park pale is about west of the castle, while the northern part forms the boundary between Chase Wood and the farm road and bridleway between Little Chase Farm and Warrior's Lodge Farm. In about 1414 Henry V had le plesans en marais ‚Äî \\"The Pleasaunce in the Marsh\\" ‚Äî built about west of the castle. This was a timber-framed banqueting house surrounded by a moated earthwork about by , which 15th-century kings used instead of the Castle's state apartments. In the 16th century, Henry VIII had the banqueting house demolished and the materials reused for timber-framed buildings inside the castle. The mere was drained in 1649, but \\"The Pleasaunce\\" earthworks survive as a Scheduled Monument. parish church of St Nicholas, where Elizabeth I worshipped in 1575 and James I visited in 1616 Elizabeth I visited Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester at Kenilworth Castle several times, the last in 1575. Dudley entertained the Queen with pageants and banquets costing some ¬£1,000 per day that surpassed anything seen in England before.Information about Elizabethan masques These included fireworks. Warwick District Council owns and manages land across the Coventry Road at Tainter's Hill. This public open space was designated \\"for the poor of the parish\\" under an inclosure act in 1756 and is registered as common land. In 1778 Kenilworth windmill was built. Later turned into the town's water tower, it is now a private home, shorn of its sails. In 1844 the London and Birmingham Railway opened the Coventry to Leamington Line, including Kenilworth railway station. The L&NWR; had a new station built in 1883 and a new link line between Kenilworth and in 1884 to bypass . This closed to all traffic on 3 March 1969.Warwickshire Railways - Kenilworth JunctionWarwickshire Railways website article; Retrieved 3 September 2013 British Rail withdrew passenger services from the Coventry to Leamington Line and closed Kenilworth Station in January 1965 in line with The Reshaping of British Railways report. In May 1977, British Rail reinstated passenger services, but did not reopen Kenilworth station, which became derelict and was eventually demolished. In 2011 Warwick Council granted John Laing plc planning permission to build a new station, which was to open in 2013. However, this was postponed by four years to December 2017. In 2018, a track from Coventry was opened. There is also a track from Leamington. The train has a single carriage. The railway in the 19th century brought industrialists from Birmingham and Coventry, to develop the residential area around the town's railway station. In the 19th century the town had some fine large mansions with landscaped gardens; these were demolished after the First World War and Second World War for housing developments. The names of them survive in the names of some roads and areas. For example, Towers Close was built on the grounds of Rouncil Towers. Some large trees from their grounds survive, including giant sequoias from the Moorlands and Rouncil Towers. Parish church of St John the Evangelist The town's growth occasioned the addition of a second Church of England parish church, St John's, which is on Warwick Road in Knights Meadow. It was designed by Ewan Christian and built in 1851‚Äì1852 as a Gothic Revival building with a south-west bell tower and broach spire. After 1883, the 1844 station in Warwick Road was partly rebuilt at the far end of Station Road behind the King's Arms and Castle Hotel. Both station and hotel were demolished in 1983, but some railway stonework remains. The old King's Arms exterior was copied and reopened in 2007 as a chain restaurant. It has distinctive pillars on its Warwick Road frontage. Sir Walter Scott stayed in the hotel when working on his novel Kenilworth. In 1884 the Parish Church of St Nicholas set up a mission room above the Co-Op in Park Road. It attracted a congregation of 150 and in 1885 moved to new premises. In 1905 it moved again to a \\"tin tabernacle\\" iron building newly erected in Albion Street and consecrated as Saint Barnabas Mission Church, a daughter church of St Nicholas. The railway boosted Kenilworth's market gardening. There were reputedly 40 nurseries growing market-garden produce in Kenilworth, but all have now been redeveloped for housing. The last was Guest's Nursery, which was developed as 23 houses in 2002. The Victorian era saw much expansion of the town to the west of Abbey Fields and on land around Warwick Road. Most buildings along Warwick Road date from this period and later, but a few earlier cottages survive. Further east the Woodside Hotel was built in about 1860 and was the home of several notable people. The former mansion in Forrest Road, built around 1901, still stands. It is believed that a William Forrest bought the surrounding land, except that of the terrace to the north of Abbey End, and built the house either for himself or for his family. The house was split into three separate residential lots in the 1970s, the main part forming Hillcrest, the west wing with the main grand staircase and gardens Max Gate, and the billiard room the bungalow South Brent. The old landscaped gardens to the east and west of the property have been built over for housing, but the south and north gardens still belong to the house. Some features have been lost during the transition internally, but externally the house still has its grand bay windows, tiled walls, high chimney stacks and other features, which can be seen in the new flats, Mulberry Court on Abbey End. Warwick Road is now the main commercial centre of the town. Most older buildings in Kenilworth are found in Castle Green, New Row and High Street, which has long-established shops. The age of the buildings makes it appear that this is the original settlement, but in fact it is simply the oldest part still in existence. The original settlement along present-day Warwick Road has been redeveloped continually since the 12th century and retains few original buildings. Many houses around Castle Green are built of stone salvaged in the 17th century, when the castle walls were slighted after the English Civil War. In May 1961, the Kenilworth Society was formed over concerns about a group of 17th-century listed cottages adjacent to Finham Brook in Bridge Street. It sets out to promote awareness of Kenilworth's character and encourage its preservation. In the early 1980s, the town's name was used by one of the first generation of computer retailers, a company called Kenilworth Computers based near the Clock Tower, for its repackaging of the Nascom microcomputer with the selling point that it was robust enough to be used by agriculture.http://www.nascomhomepage.com/pdf/Kenilworth_case.pdf Kenilworth was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record- breaking nationwide outbreak on that day.European Severe Weather Dabase Retrieved 10 November 2018.

Continuing their summer campaign to seize the important rail and supply center of Atlanta, Union forces commanded by William Tecumseh Sherman overwhelmed and defeated Confederate forces defending the city under John Bell Hood. Union Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson was killed during the battle. Despite the implication of finality in its name, the battle occurred midway through the campaign, and the city did not fall until September 2, 1864, after a Union siege and various attempts to seize railroads and supply lines leading to Atlanta. After taking the city, Sherman's troops headed south-southeastward toward Milledgeville, the state capital, and on to Savannah with the March to the Sea. The fall of Atlanta was especially noteworthy for its political ramifications. In the 1864 election, former Union general George B. McClellan, a Democrat, ran against President Lincoln, on a peace platform calling for a truce with the Confederacy. The capture of Atlanta and Hood's burning of military facilities as he evacuated were extensively covered by Northern newspapers, significantly boosting Northern morale, and Lincoln was re-elected by a significant margin. Background In the Atlanta Campaign, Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman commanded the Union forces of the Western Theater. The main Union force in the battle was the Army of the Tennessee, under Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. He was one of the favorite commanders of Sherman and Ulysses Grant by being very quick and aggressive. Within Sherman's army, the XV Corps was commanded by Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, the XVI Corps was commanded by Maj. Gen. Grenville M. Dodge, and Maj. Gen. Frank P. Blair Jr. commanded the XVII Corps. During the months leading up to the battle, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston had repeatedly retreated from Sherman's superior force. All along the Western and Atlantic Railroad line, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Marietta, Georgia, a pattern was played and replayed: Johnston took up a defensive position, Sherman marched to outflank the Confederate defenses, and Johnston retreated again. After Johnston's withdrawal following the Battle of Resaca, the two armies clashed again at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, but the Confederate senior leadership in Richmond was unhappy with Johnston's perceived reluctance to fight the Union army, even though he had little chance of winning. Thus, on July 17, as he was preparing for the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Johnston was relieved of his command and replaced by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. The dismissal and replacement of Johnston remains one of the most controversial decisions of the civil war. Hood, who was fond of taking risks, lashed out at Sherman's army at Peachtree Creek, but the attack failed, with more than 2500 Confederate casualties. Hood needed to defend the city of Atlanta, which was an important rail hub and industrial center for the Confederacy, but his army was small in comparison to the armies that Sherman commanded. He decided to withdraw, classically threatening Sherman's supply lines in his army's rear. Hood hoped his aggressiveness and the size of his still formidable force on-the-move would entice the Union troops to come forward against him, if only to protect their rear supply lines. The Union did not do so. McPherson's army closed in upon Decatur, Georgia, to the east side of Atlanta. Twice more in later campaigns, Hood would seek to lure the thrust of a Union axis of advance upon a position and/or force that he was commanding to seek an engagement. The Union's forces were not turned in those cases either. Opposing Forces Battle Palisades and chevaux de frise in front of the Potter (or Pondor) House, Atlanta, Georgia, 1864 ATLANTA CAMPAIGN: Atlanta and Vicinity (Summer 1864). A sketch of the Battle of Atlanta, July 22, 1864. Meanwhile, Hood ordered Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee's corps on a march around the Union left flank, had Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry march near Sherman's supply line, and had Maj. Gen. Benjamin Cheatham's corps attack the Union front. However, it took longer than expected for Hardee to get his men into position, and, during that time, McPherson had correctly deduced a possible threat to his left flank, and sent XVI Corps, his reserve, to help strengthen it. Hardee's men met this other force, and the battle began. Although the initial Confederate attack was repulsed, the Union left flank began to retreat. About this time, McPherson, who had ridden to the front to observe the battle, was shot and killed by Confederate infantry. Confederate Maj. Gen. William H.T. Walker was also killed, shot from his horse by a Union picket. Near Decatur, Brig. Gen. John W. Sprague, in command of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division of the XVI Corps, was attacked by Wheeler's cavalry. Wheeler had taken the Fayetteville Road, while Hardee's column took the Flat Shoals Road toward McPherson's position. The Federals fled the town in a stampede, but managed to save the ordnance and supply trains of the XV, XVI, XVII, and XX corps. With the failure of Hardee's assault, Wheeler was in no position to hold Decatur, and fell back to Atlanta that night. Sprague was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. The main lines of battle now formed an \\"L\\" shape, with Hardee's attack forming the lower part of the \\"L,\\" and Cheatham's attack on the Union front as the vertical member of the \\"L\\". Hood intended to attack the Union troops from both east and west. The fighting centered on a hill east of the city known as Bald Hill. The Federals had arrived two days earlier, and began to shell the city proper, killing several civilians. A savage struggle, sometimes hand-to-hand, developed around the hill, lasting until just after dark. The Federals held the hill while the Confederates retired to a point just south of there. Meanwhile, two miles to the north, Cheatham's troops had broken through the Union lines at the Georgia railroad. In response, twenty artillery pieces were positioned near Sherman's headquarters at Copen Hill, and shelled the Confederates, while Logan's XV Corps regrouped and repulsed the Southern troops. The Union had suffered about 3,400 casualties, including Maj. Gen. McPherson, to the Confederate's 5,500. This was a devastating loss for the already reduced Confederate army, but they still held the city. Siege and closure Confederate sappers constructed a number of artillery emplacements covering the avenues of approach to Atlanta. The artillery in this fortification overlooks Peachtree Street. Sherman settled into a siege of Atlanta, shelling the city and sending raids west and south of the city to cut off the supply lines from Macon, Georgia. Both of Sherman's cavalry raids including McCook's raid and Stoneman's Raid were defeated by Confederate cavalry collectively under General Wheeler. Although the raids partially achieved their objective of cutting railroad tracks and destroying supply wagons, they were soon after repaired and supplies continued to move to the city of Atlanta.Matthews, Byron H. (1976). The McCook-Stoneman Raid. Brannon Publishing. Following the failure to break the Confederates' hold on the city, Sherman began to employ a new strategy. He swung his entire army in a broad flanking maneuver to the west. Finally, on August 31, at Jonesborough, Georgia, Sherman's army captured the railroad track from Macon, pushing the Confederates to Lovejoy's Station. With his supply lines fully severed, Hood pulled his troops out of Atlanta the next day, September 1, destroying supply depots as he left to prevent them from falling into Union hands. He also set fire to eighty-one loaded ammunition cars, which led to a conflagration watched by hundreds. On September 2, Mayor James Calhoun, along with a committee of Union-leaning citizens including William Markham, Jonathan Norcross, and Edward Rawson, met a captain on the staff of Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, and surrendered the city, asking for \\"protection to non-combatants and private property\\". Sherman, who was in Jonesboro at the time of surrender, sent a telegram to Washington on September 3, reading, \\"Atlanta is ours, and fairly won\\". He then established his headquarters there on September 7, where he stayed for over two months. On November 15, the army departed east toward Savannah, on what became known as \\"Sherman's March to the Sea\\". Aftermath Union Depot after burning by Sherman's troops, 1864 The fall of Atlanta and the success of the overall Atlanta Campaign were extensively covered by Northern newspapers, and were a boon to Northern morale and to President Lincoln's political standing. The 1864 election was between General George B. McClellan and Abraham Lincoln. McClellan ran a conflicted campaign: McClellan was a Unionist who advocated continuing the war until the defeat of the Confederacy, but the Democratic platform included calls for negotiations with the Confederacy on the subject of a potential truce. The capture of Atlanta and Hood's burning of military facilities as he evacuated showed that a successful conclusion of the war was in sight, weakening support for a truce. Lincoln was reelected by a comfortable margin, with 212 out of 233 electoral votes. Georgia Historical Marker for the surrender of Atlanta Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson, who was one of the highest-ranking Union officers killed in action during the Civil War, was mourned and honored by Sherman, who declared in his official report: > His public enemies, even the men who directed the fatal shot, never spoke or > wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded > loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in > words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that > every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will feel a sense of > personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not > only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified > to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious > men. Despite the damage caused by the war, Atlanta recovered from its downfall relatively quickly; as one observer noted as early as November 1865, \\"A new city is springing up with marvelous rapidity\\". Within a week of the fall of Atlanta however, Sherman had issued all non-military personnel out of Atlanta. Reportedly he remembered the cities of Memphis and Vicksburg which became a burden immediately after victory, so he told the civilians specifically to go north or go south. A truce of sorts was quickly established at a town nearby called Rough And Ready with General Hood, where Union and Confederate prisoners were in small numbers exchanged and civilians wishing to go south could get help to that end. Legacy The Potter (or Ponder) House in Atlanta housed Confederate sharpshooters until Union artillery made a special target of it This historic gas lamp, located in the Underground Atlanta, was shelled by Union artillery prior to the Battle of Atlanta. There are two bronze plaques mounted on it, one of which commemorates Solomon (Sam) Luckie, one of 40 free blacks, who died from the wounds that he received from the shell that struck the lamp. Commemorated on the other plaque are the Confederacy, the Battle of East Atlanta, and one of the local men who fought in that battle. Map of Atlanta Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program In 1880, Atlanta ranked among the fifty largest cities in the United States. The battlefield is now urban, residential, and commercial land, with many markers memorializing notable events of the battle, including McPherson's place of death. The marker was erected in 1956 by the Georgia Historical Commission. To commemorate the 140th anniversary of the battle, in 2004, two new markers were erected in the Inman Park neighborhood. The Atlanta Cyclorama building, built in 1921 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located in Grant Park and formerly contained a panoramic painting of the battle. In 2014, the City of Atlanta sold the Battle of Atlanta Cyclorama to Atlanta History Center. Atlanta History Center constructed new, purpose-built building at their Buckhead Campus to house the art piece. The painting itself underwent an extensive restoration to reverse changes made to the original painting in the 1890s. The Cyclorama and accompanying exhibition (Cyclorama: The Big Picture) opened at Atlanta History Center on February 22, 2019. One notable establishment destroyed by Union soldiers was the Potter (or Ponder) House, built in 1857, and owned by Ephraim G. Ponder, a holder of 65 slaves before the war. In the battle, it was used by Confederate sharpshooters until Union artillery inflicted heavy damage. It was never rebuilt. One of Ponder's slaves, Festus Flipper, was the father of Henry Ossian Flipper, who later became the first African American cadet to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point.

An electric unicycle (‚ÄòEUC,‚Äô sometimes pronounced 'yuke') is a self-balancing personal transporter with a single wheel. The rider controls speed by leaning forwards or backwards, and steers by leaning and twisting the unit side to side with their feet. The self-balancing mechanism uses gyroscopes and accelerometers.  Operation Most commercial units are self-balancing in the direction of travel only (single axis) with lateral stability being provided by the rider; more complex fully self-balancing dual-axis devices also need to self-balance from side to side. The control mechanisms of both use control moment gyroscopes, reaction wheels and/or auxiliary pendulums and can be considered to be inverted pendulum.  History  thumb =Early experimentation= :See also Monowheel A hand-power monowheel was patented in 1869 by Richard C. Hemming with a pedal-power unit patented in 1885. Various motorized monowheels were developed and demonstrated during the 1930s without commercial success and Charles F Taylor was granted a patent for a \\"vehicle having a single supporting and driving wheel\\" in 1964 after some 25 years of experimentation. =Commercialisation= In 2003, Bombardier announced a conceptual design for such a device used as a sport vehicle, the Embrio. In September 2004 Trevor Blackwell demonstrated a functional self-balancing unicycle, using the control-mechanism similar to that used by the Segway PT and published the designs as the Eunicycle. In 2008 RYNO Motors demonstrated their prototype unit. In January 2009 Focus Designs demonstrates electric unicycle to Segway inventor. In March 2010 Shane Chen of Inventist filed a patent application for a seatless electric unicycle (associated with the \\"Solowheel\\" product launched in February 2011). In Oct 2010 Focus Designs published a video of an electric unicycle with hub motor and a seat. Late in 2015, the Ford Motor Company patented a \\"self-propelled unicycle engagable with vehicle\\", intended for last-mile commuters.

It is the biggest shellfish port in Scotland and one of the largest in Europe, landing over 5,450 tonnes in 2016.Fishing Industry Statistics Aberdeenshire Council (December 2017) Fraserburgh is also a major port for white and pelagic fish. History =16th and 17th century: Origins= The name of the town means, literally, 'burgh of Fraser', after the Fraser family that bought the lands of Philorth in 1504 and thereafter brought about major improvement due to investment over the next century. Fraserburgh became a burgh of barony in 1546. By 1570, the Fraser family had built a castle (Fraserburgh Castle) at Kinnaird Head and within a year a church was built for the area. By the 1590s, the area (now known as Faithlie) had developed a small harbour. In 1592, Faithlie was renamed Fraserburgh by a charter of the Crown under King James VI. Sir Alexander Fraser was given permission to improve and govern the town as Lord Saltoun. At present, this title is still in existence and is held by Flora Fraser, 20th Lady Saltoun and head of Clan Fraser. The Royal Charter also gave permission to build a college and university in Fraserburgh allowing the Lord Saltoun to appoint a rector, a principal, a sub-principal, and all the professors for teaching the different sciences. A grant from the Parliament of Scotland in 1595 allowed the first college building to be erected by Alexander Fraser, and in 1597 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland recommended the Rev. Charles Ferme, then minister at the Old Parish, to be its first (and only) principal.(ed.) Thomson, Thomas, Acts and Proceedings of the General Assemblies of the Kirk of Scotland, Church of Scotland General Assembly, Edinburgh, 1845. In 1601, Fraserburgh became a burgh of regality. The college, however, closed only a decade or so after Ferme's arrest on the orders of James VI for taking part in the 1605 General Assembly of Aberdeen, being used again only for a short time in 1647 when King's College, Aberdeen temporarily relocated owing to an outbreak of plague. A plaque commemorating the University's existence may be seen at the Fraserburgh Heritage Centre. =18th and 19th century: Further growth and development= The population of Fraserburgh was growing with peaks due to seasonal employment. From a population of an estimated 1682 in 1755, a population of about 2,000 was recorded in 1780, of whom 1,000 resided in the town proper. There were a further 200 people in the village of Broadsea.The Statistical Account on the Parish of Fraserburgh, between 1791‚Äì1799 (probably 1791) by Rev. Alexander Simpson of the Fraserburgh Old Parish Church In 1787, Fraserburgh Castle was converted to Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, Scotland's first mainland lighthouse and the first in Scotland to be lit by the Commissioners of Northern Lights. In the 1790s, Rev. Alexander Simpson of the Fraserburgh Old Parish Church describes the harbour as small but good, telling that it had the capability to take vessels with '200 tons burden'. The Reverend notes that shipbuilding had become a main industry in the town, especially after 1784, and that the locals were making donations and seeking government assistance to have the harbour enlarged. In 1803, the original 1571 church building was replaced and enlarged to seat 1,000 people. The Auld Kirk was to be the standing authority in the town up until the 1840s. This period also saw the extension of the harbour, with a northern pier of 300 yards being built between 1807‚Äì1812 and, in 1818, a southern pier being built following an Act of Parliament. Fraserburgh's population boomed in the early 19th Century, from 2271 in 1811 to 2954 by 1831. This was primarily put down to the growth in herring fishing, which intensified in 1815. The herring season also brought with it an additional 1,200 people working in the Parish. Contemporary accounts mention the increase in general wealth brought by this increased trade spurring a change in dress and diet as well as a considerable amount of new houses being built in the town. No less than ¬£30,000 was spent developing the harbour between 1807 and 1840 by which time the harbour held eight vessels of 45‚Äì155 tons and 220 boats of the herring fishery.The Statistical Account on the Parish of Fraserburgh (January 1840) by Rev. John Cumming of the Fraserburgh Old Parish Church =Lifeboat service= The town has had a local lifeboat on service since 1806 which was run privately by the local Harbour Board until the first RNLI operated station opened in 1858. This was the first official RNLI station opened in Scotland. Throughout the 20th century, Fraserburgh suffered three lifeboat disasters. First, in 1919, the 'Lady Rothes' capsized while assisting H.M. Drifter Eminent. Coxswain Andrew Noble and Acting Second Coxswain Andrew Faquhar drowned. Second, on 9 February 1953, six crew members lost their lives when the lifeboat capsized while escorting fishing vessels to the harbour. On this occasion Coxswain Andrew Ritchie, Mechanic George Duthie, Bowman Charles Tait, Assistant Mechanic James Noble and Crew Members John Crawford and John Buchan all lost their lives - the only survivor was Charles Tait. Lastly, on 21 January 1970 while on service to the Danish fishing vessel Opal, the lifeboat The Duchess of Kent capsized with the loss of five of her crew of six. Those killed were Coxswain John Stephen, Mechanic Frederick Kirkness and Crew Members William Hadden, James RS Buchan and James Buchan. In 2009, a local campaign was started to raise ¬£40,000 to erect an official monument to the 14 men who lost their lives whilst serving on the Fraserburgh Lifeboat. The target was successfully achieved and the monument unveiled by Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun in August 2010. =Railways= Fraserburgh railway station opened in 1865 and closed to passengers in 1965. The railway line was built by the Formartine and Buchan Railway Company, which became part of the Great North of Scotland Railway. Trains operated to Aberdeen via Maud and Dyce, as well as a short branch line to St. Combs via Cairnbulg. In 1923 the GNSR was incorporated into the London and North Eastern Railway, which was in turn nationalised on 1 January 1948. Passenger services on the Buchan lines were withdrawn in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts, although freight trains continued to operate Fraserburgh until 1979. The track was subsequently lifted. Following the opening of the Borders Railway in September 2015, Fraserburgh became the most distant town in UK from the rail network, leading to calls for the lifted track to be reinstated.Peterhead and Fraserburgh most distant towns in UK from rail network Evening Express (7 September 2015) The nearest operating station is currently Inverurie, 56 km (35 miles) away. Climate Fraserburgh has a marine climate heavily influenced by its proximity to the sea. As such, summer highs and winter lows are heavily moderated, with very mild winter temperatures for a location so far north. The differences between seasons are very narrow as a result, with February averaging highs of and August . As a result of its marine influence, there is significant seasonal lag, with September being milder than June, and October having slightly milder nights than May, in spite of a considerable difference in the length of daylight. The climate is overcast and wet with and average of 1,351.8 hours of sunshine per year. Temperature extremes have ranged from in July 1995 to in February 1991. There is approximately of precipitation per annum. Fraserburgh is also notable for having the highest ever recorded wind speed in the UK at a low altitude. The gust was recorded on 13 February 1989 at Kinnaird Head Lighthouse.Where are the windiest places in the UK? Met Office, accessed on 8 January 2018 The corresponding hourly mean speed was .Eastern Scotland: Regional Climate Met Office, accessed on 8 January 2018 Demographics The 2011 census recorded 13,180 residents making Fraserburgh the third largest settlement in Aberdeenshire after Peterhead and Inverurie.. Since the accession of Poland and other eastern European countries to the E.U. in 2005, there has been a large influx of E.U. migrants to the town. Some 10% of residents stated the Scots language to be their primary language used at home, whilst 63.1% reported being able to speak it.https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/media/24585/fraserburghtownprofile.pdf Places of Interest The town has several attractions including an award- winning beach,Beaches Aberdeenshire Council, accessed 8 January 2018 a major commercial harbour, Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, The Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh Heritage Centre and the community war memorial by famed Scottish sculptor Alexander Carrick.

In 2013, Fraserburgh Cricket Club won the Bon Accord Cup for only the second time in their history with a close but in the end comfortable victory over Knightriders CC, thanks to a man of the match performance from Fraser Lawrance, bowling 5-6 off ten overs. In 2014, Fraserburgh Cricket Club gained promotion to Grade 1 by finishing second in Grade 2, meaning that they would play in the top tier of the Aberdeenshire Grades for the first time since 1975. The club were relegated to Grade 2 in 2015, and have remained there to the present. In 2018 the club won the Bon Accord Cup for a third time, in a re-vamp T20 competition, at Mannofield Cricket Ground, beating Gordonians.

The harbour boasts a state of the art six berth slipway facility, storm gates, a large drydock, and fully refrigerated fish market facilities.Fraserburgh Harbour Commissioners: History accessed 8 January 2017 The Apostleship of the Sea, a seafarers charity, has a port chaplain in Fraserburgh. Education The town has a variety of educational establishments, including four primary schools (Fraserburgh North School, Fraserburgh South Park School, Lochpots School, St Andrew's School), a secondary school (Fraserburgh Academy), a SEN school (Westfield School), and a campus of a college of further education (North East Scotland College). For the short-lived Fraserburgh University see above under History. =Fraserburgh Academy= The original academy building was opened in 1909. A new, more modern, school was built in the 1950s, and the original building was repurposed to house the academy's art and drama departments. The school has had many successes these past few years including having several of its pupils gaining prizes over a number of years in a nationwide photography competition - Focus Environment. In early 2009, a group of MPs from the Scottish Parliament held a petition committee meeting in the school. Also in early 2009, the art department of the school organised commemorate photo exhibition in memory of Glover's early years of living in Fraserburgh. These photos were displayed throughout the town, and some of the photos are being used as part of the Homecoming Scotland campaign. See article - Thomas Blake Glover In September 2009, the school had a visit from the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy who gave a speech to pupils from the school and others from the whole of Aberdeenshire.  Religion  Christianity is the prevalent religion in Fraserburgh and it is home to many congregations from a wide variety of Christian denominations. This includes three Church of Scotland congregations and four Pentecostal congregations (Elim Pentecostal, Assembly of God, Calvary Chapel and Emmanuel Christian Fellowship). Additionally, there are also congregations of Baptists, Roman Catholics, Scottish Episcopalians, Evangelists, Congregationalists, Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Salvationists.  Fraserburgh Junior Arts Society  *Ward 3 - Fraserburgh and District www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk, accessed 28 July 2009 In 1952 the Fraserburgh Photographic Society staged a pantomime, ‚ÄúHumpty Dumpty‚Äù, to raise funds for equipment. The pantomime was so successful that the following year some of the members came together and formed the Fraserburgh Junior Arts Society. The object of the society being to encourage young people in the Arts. The society conducts pantomimes, plays, musicals and variety theatre, and has also been involved in all the major community events in Fraserburgh. Back in 1957 the society organised the formation of the Swimming Pool Fund after several fatalities at the beach, the project was subsequently adopted by Aberdeenshire Council resulting in Fraserburgh swimming pool‚Äôs completion in 1969. During the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs FJAS participated in and organised events in the local annual gala. Some former members have gone on to make Drama, Music or Dance their career after more formal training at institutes like University of West London, Aberdeen University, The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, MGA, Telford College, Trinity College, The University of Northampton and the London College of Music.

As such, it was bundled with several versions of Microsoft Windows, from Windows 98 to Windows Server 2003, and was available for Windows 3.x, Windows NT 3.51, Windows 95, Mac System 7, Mac OS 8, and Mac OS 9. In Windows Vista, Outlook Express was superseded by Windows Mail. Outlook Express is a different application from Microsoft Outlook. The two apps do not share a common codebase, but they do share a common architectural philosophy. The similar names lead many people to conclude incorrectly that Outlook Express is a stripped-down version of Microsoft Outlook. Outlook Express uses the Windows Address Book to store contact information and integrates tightly with it. On Windows XP, it also integrates with Windows Messenger. History Microsoft Internet Mail and News Version 1.0 was released as Microsoft Internet Mail and News in 1996 following the Internet Explorer 3 release. This add-on precedes the Internet Mail profile for Microsoft Exchange 4.0 bundled in Windows 95. Version 2.0 was released at the end of 1996. Internet Mail and News handled only plain text and rich text (RTF) email, lacking HTML email. In 1997 the app was changed and renamed as Outlook Express and bundled with Internet Explorer 4. The Windows executable file for Outlook Express, msimn.exe, is a holdover from the Internet Mail and News era. Like Internet Explorer, Outlook Express 4 can run on Mac System 7, OS 8, and OS 9. At one point, in a later beta version of Outlook Express 5, Outlook Express contained a sophisticated and adaptive spam filtering system; however this feature was removed shortly before launch. It was speculated on various websites and newsgroups at that time, that the feature was not stable enough for the mass market. Nearly two years later, a similar system, using a similar method of adaptive filtering, appeared as a feature of Microsoft Outlook. Internet Explorer 5 required Outlook Express 5 to save Web Archive files (see MHTML). Outlook Express 6 is the last version of the software with Outlook branding. It has a similar layout to Outlook Express 5. It was included with Windows XP. Versions for Windows * Microsoft Internet Mail and News 1.0 was released in 1996 with Internet Explorer 3. * Microsoft Internet Mail and News 2.0 was released later in 1996. * Outlook Express 4.0, which was included in Windows 98 (June 1998) and integrated with Internet Explorer 4, stored messages in *.mbx files (similar to the Mbox format used in Unix-based systems). * Outlook Express 5.0, which was included in Windows 98 Second Edition (SE) (June 1999) and integrated with Internet Explorer 5, switched to *.dbx files, with a separate file for each mailbox folder. * Outlook Express 5.01 was included in Windows 2000 (February 2000) and integrated with Internet Explorer 5.01. * Outlook Express 5.5 was included in Windows Me (June 2000) and integrated with Internet Explorer 5.5. * Outlook Express 6.0 was included in Windows XP (October 2001) and integrated with Internet Explorer 6. Versions for Mac * Outlook Express 4.0 was included in Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition. * Outlook Express 5.01 was integrated with Internet Explorer 5. * Outlook Express 5.01 was bundled with Internet Explorer 5.01. * Outlook Express 5.5 was bundled with Internet Explorer 5.5. Replacements Builds of \\"Outlook Express 7\\" appeared in early builds of Windows Vista when in development as \\"Longhorn\\". It relied on WinFS for the management and storage of contacts and other data. The final version of Vista included a successor to Outlook Express known as Windows Mail (Vista). Criticism =Email standards= Beginning with the text-based Unix Mail command, email traditionally used the inline or bottom posting styles when replying to messages. Outlook Express, as well as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Outlook, top-post (show replies newest to oldest) by default. Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange use a proprietary email attachment format called Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) to handle formatting and other features specific to Outlook such as meeting requests. Outlook Express and other email clients are unable to read this format. This can be confusing to Outlook Express users (as well as those who use other email clients) who receive attachments sent from Outlook. =Database corruption= Outlook Express has been prone to a number of problems which can corrupt its files database, especially when the database increases in size due to an increasing number of stored emails and during database compaction. This has led to a thriving market for apps that can back up, restore and recover corrupted files. An open-source project called UnDBX was also created, which seems to be successful in recovering corrupt databases. Microsoft has also released documentation which may be able to correct some non-severe problems and restore access to email messages, without resorting to third-party solutions. However, with the latest updates applied, Outlook Express now makes backup copies of \`DBX\` files prior to compaction. They are stored in the Recycle Bin. If an error occurs during compaction and messages are lost, the \`DBX\` files can be copied from the recycle bin. =Security issues= Outlook Express was one of the earlier email clients to support HTML email and scripts. As a result, emails were commonly infected with viruses. Previously, another security flaw was that a script could automatically be opened as an attachment. Another bug was in Outlook Express's attachment handling that allowed an executable to appear to be a harmless attachment such as a graphics file. Opening or previewing the email could cause code to run without the user's knowledge or consent. Outlook Express uses Internet Explorer to render HTML email. Internet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns. With Outlook Express SP2 (part of Windows XP SP2), Microsoft has tried to correct the security holes. Outlook Express now blocks images inside emails by default. It uses only the restricted security zone for HTML email, which disables scripts and imposes restrictions on what web content can be rendered. It also warns when opening potentially malicious attachments. =Handling of PGP/MIME signed messages= Outlook Express does not correctly handle MIME, and will not display the body of signed messages inline. Users get a filled email and one attachment (one of the message text and one of the signature) and therefore need to open an attachment to see the email. If the email has been forwarded several times, users need to open attached email messages one inside the other multiple times to reach the parent email message. This bug has still not been rectified. The proper behavior is described in RFC 1847. When replying or forwarding a message to a user who has a digital signature, Outlook Express gives an error and does not allow the user to continue if there is no digital signature installed for the sender. =Extensibility= Outlook Express does not have a documented object model like Microsoft Outlook. Programmatic access to, or control of Outlook Express for custom messaging applications or plugins is not officially documented and supported by Microsoft. \`IStoreNamespace\` and \`IStoreFolder\` interfaces were documented in 2003, but they are only related to the storage. Some companies have managed to create their plugins hacking the interface using Windows hooks. A significant one was the PGP plugin because it was the only example of a working plugin whose source code was available (licensed under GPL). By 2003, some companies provided commercial solutions to develop add-ins. =Office 2007 spell checker incompatibility= Outlook Express does not have a dedicated spell checker. It can use the spell checkers from Microsoft Office if Office is also installed. However, the Office 2007 spell checkers, except for the French spell checker, are incompatible with Outlook Express. Microsoft has acknowledged this problem, but does not provide any sort of remedy. A solution is to install any pre-Office 2007 proofing tools or use a third party spell-checking app for Outlook Express. Windows Live Mail, which is based on Windows Mail's source code, contains built-in spell checking support (now for US English and numerous other languages) and is freely downloadable for Windows XP. =Glitches and other unusual aspects= Cancelling sending an email while it is being sent does not effectively prevent it from being sent. Similarly, when importing \`.PST\` files, cancelling the import while it is in progress merely cancels the import of the current folder and the import resumes with the next folder. Furthermore, Outlook Express only supports .dbx files that are smaller than 2 GB, and may have performance problems when dealing with files approaching that limit.

He was a builder of follies, philanthropist, patron of the arts and sciences, and a supporter of slavery. He purchased and commissioned many paintings from J.M.W. Turner. He was sponsor and mentor to Michael Faraday.  Early life  Fuller was born on 20 February 1757 in North Stoneham, Hampshire. He was christened in the village of Waldron, near Heathfield in Sussex, in the south of England. His parents were the Reverend Henry Fuller (15 January 1713 ‚Äì 23 July 1761) and his wife Frances, n√©e Fuller (1725 ‚Äì 14 February 1778).John \\"Mad Jack\\" Fuller, Squire of Brightling: a genealogy . He lost his father in 1761, when he was four. At the age of ten, in 1767, he began his education at Eton College, a famous public school in Berkshire. On 7 May 1777, Jack Fuller's uncle Rose Fuller, MP died, leaving Jack his Sussex estates and Jamaican plantations. Jack Fuller thus took possession of the Rose Hill estate (now Brightling Park) at Brightling, Sussex at the age of 20.  Political career  In 1779, John \\"Mad Jack\\" Fuller, at the age of 22, was captain of a light infantry company in the Sussex Militia. In 1796, Fuller was appointed High Sheriff of Sussex, for a period of one year, and in 1798, he became a captain in the Sussex Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry. In 1780, at the age of 23, Jack Fuller was elected to Parliament. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Southampton from 1780 to 1784, and for Sussex from 1801 to 1812. Fuller, a noted drunk, on 27 February 1810 was involved in an incident with the Speaker in Parliament, which led to him being seized by the Serjeant-at-Arms and to public disgrace.Hansard, 27 February 1810 At that time he was serving on a committee that was enquiring into the reasons behind the disastrous Walcheren Expedition the previous year. Fuller was a staunch supporter of slavery. He owned a Jamaican plantation, along with the slaves who worked it, which he had inherited from his uncle, Rose Fuller. In one debate he claimed that West Indian slaves lived in better conditions than many people in England. On 17 July 1781, Fuller's sister Elizabeth married Sir John Palmer Acland, a grandson of Sir Hugh Acland MP, in St. Marylebone in London. In 1790, at the age of 33, he proposed marriage to Susannah Arabella Thrale, daughter of Henry Thrale and Hester Thrale but was rebuffed. In fact, he never married, and is not known to have had any children. In 1811, a pyramid-shaped building, often referred to as \\"The Pyramid\\", was erected in the churchyard of the Church of St. Thomas √† Becket in Brightling Brightling, Sussex as a future mausoleum for Jack Fuller. Fuller retired from politics in 1812, not standing for re- election in the General Election of that year.  Later life  \\"Mad Jack\\" Fuller's tomb in Brightling Churchyard Fuller was a supporter and sponsor of the Royal Institution in London. He acted as mentor and supporter of the young Michael Faraday. In 1818 he loaned the Institution ¬£1000 (about ¬£100,000 in today's value) and later wrote off this debt. In 1828 he established the Fuller medal of the Royal Institution and in early 1833 he founded the Fullerian Professorship of Chemistry to which Michael Faraday was appointed as the first professor. Later he also endowed the institution with the Fullerian Professorship of Physiology.John Fuller: Patron of the Royal Institution Retrieved January 2007. In 1818, Fuller built the Observatory at Brightling which had been designed by Robert Smirke, and in 1822, he endowed Eastbourne in Sussex with its first lifeboat. Unsubstantiated sources claim that in 1828, he financed the building of the Belle Tout Lighthouse, on the cliff at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne. The first Belle Tout lighthouse was a temporary wooden structure that started service on 1 October 1828. The construction of the permanent granite lighthouse began in 1829 and it became operational on 11 October 1834. On Thursday, 18 September 1828, Jack Fuller bought Bodiam Castle for 3000 guineas at auction to save it from destruction. On the afternoon of Friday 11 April 1834, Fuller died at his home, 36 Devonshire Place, London. He was buried under the Pyramid in Brightling churchyard. The main beneficiaries of his will were his nephew, Peregrine Palmer Fuller Palmer Acland (1789‚Äì1871) and General Sir Augustus Elliot Fuller (1777‚Äì1857) who was John Fuller's first cousin once removed.

The Solemn League and Covenant was an agreement between the Scottish Covenanters and the leaders of the English Parliamentarians in 1643 during the First English Civil War. On 17 August 1643, the Church of Scotland (the Kirk) accepted it and on 25 September 1643 so did the English Parliament and the Westminster Assembly. English Parliament (First Civil War) At the time, the Protestant leaders of the English Parliament were in conflict with King Charles I. Fearing Irish Catholic troops could join the Royalist army, Parliament requested the aid of the Scots. The Presbyterian Covenanters promised their aid, on condition that the Scottish system of church government was adopted in England. This was acceptable to the majority of the English Long Parliament, as many MPs were Presbyterians, while others preferred allying with the Scots to losing the Civil War. A 17th-century playing card shows English Puritans taking the Covenant After some haggling a document called \\"The Solemn League and Covenant\\" was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between the English Parliament and its Scottish counterpart for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and Ireland \\"according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches\\", and the \\"extirpation of popery [and] prelacy\\". It did not explicitly mention Presbyterianism, and included some ambiguous formulations which left the door open to the English Independents, another strong faction on the English Parliamentary side, particularly in the parliamentary armies. It was subscribed to by many in England, Scotland, and Ireland, approved by the English Long Parliament, and, with some slight modifications, by the Westminster Assembly of Divines. However, not all those on the English Parliamentarian side were happy with this arrangement and some, like John Lilburne, chose to leave the parliamentary armies rather than take the oath prescribed in the Act enforcing the Solemn League and Covenant. The agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the First English Civil War. When the Scots army entered England by invitation of the English Parliament in January 1644 the Parliamentary Committee of Safety was replaced by an ad hoc committee representative of both kingdoms which, by parliamentary ordinance of 16 February, was formally constituted the Committee of Both Kingdoms. Its object was the management of peace overtures to, or making war on, King Charles I. The Scots withdrew from the Committee after the end of the First Civil War, although it continued to sit and from then on was known as the Derby House Committee (as it sat in Derby House in London). Engagement and Charles I (Second Civil War) After the Royalists had lost the First Civil War, Charles I was able to enter into an \\"Engagement\\" with the majority of the Covenanters in which they agreed to support him in the Second English Civil War against their mutual enemy the English Independents, in return for Charles imposing Presbyterianism for three years on England. In 1648 the Royalists and the Covenanters were defeated at the Battle of Preston, and Charles was executed in January 1649. Charles II (Third Civil War) Charles II. After the Kirk Party seized power from the unsuccessful and therefore discredited Engagers, the new Scottish Covenanter government persuaded the exiled Charles II to agree to the terms of the Solemn League and Covenant in the Treaty of Breda (1650). However, the defeat of the Royalist and Scottish army at the Battle of Worcester in 1651 ended the relevance of the Solemn League and Covenant as the power of the Presbyterians was broken on both sides of the border. Restoration and the Sedition Act After the Restoration the English Parliament passed the Sedition Act 1661, which declared that the Solemn League and Covenant was unlawful, was to be abjured by all persons holding public offices, and was to be burnt by the common hangman.

They are part of the northern Appalachian Mountains and the most rugged mountains in New England. The range is heavily visited due to its proximity to Boston and, to a lesser extent, New York City and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Most of the area is public land, including the White Mountain National Forest and a number of state parks. Its most famous mountain is Mount Washington, which is the highest peak in the Northeastern U.S. and for 76 years held the record for fastest surface wind gust in the world ( in 1934). Mount Washington is part of a line of summits, the Presidential Range, that are named after U.S. presidents and other prominent Americans. The White Mountains also include the Franconia Range, Sandwich Range, Carter-Moriah Range and Kinsman Range in New Hampshire, and the Mahoosuc Range straddling the border between it and Maine. In all, there are 48 peaks within New Hampshire as well as one (Old Speck Mountain) in Maine over , known as the four-thousand footers. The Whites are known for a system of alpine huts for hikers operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club. The Appalachian Trail crosses the area from southwest to northeast. Etymology It is not clear where the name \\"White Mountains\\" came from. There is no record of what Native Americans called the range, although pre-Colonial names for many individual peaks are known.AMC: \\"How the White Mountains Were Named\\" The name and similar ones such as \\"White Hills\\" or \\"Wine Hills\\" are found in literature from Colonial times. According to tradition, the mountains were first sighted from shipboard off the coast near the Piscataqua estuary. The highest peaks would often be snow-capped, appearing white. An alternate theory is that the mica-laden granite of the summits looked white to observers. Geology and physiography Map of the main regions of the northeast Appalachians The White Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division. The magma intrusions forming the White Mountains today were created 124 to 100 million years ago as the North American Plate moved westward over the New England hotspot. Widespread evidence of glaciation may be seen in the U-shaped form of various notches, or mountain passes. Glacial cirques form the heads of Tuckerman Ravine on Mt. Washington and King Ravine on Mt. Adams. Glacial striations are visible at numerous locations, including on the exposed rocks at the summit of Pine Mountain in Gorham. Attractions The Mount Washington Auto Road and the historic Mount Washington Cog Railway ascend the range's highest peak, which hosts a visitor center and weather observatory. Heavily visited Arethusa Falls, the second tallest waterfall in New Hampshire, lies on a southwest flank of Crawford Notch. The Old Man of the Mountain, a rock formation on Cannon Mountain that resembled the craggy profile of a man's face, was a White Mountain landmark until it fell in May 2003. It remains the state symbol of New Hampshire. The range also includes a natural feature dubbed \\"The Basin\\", consisting of a granite bowl, in diameter, fed by a waterfall, worn smooth by the Pemigewasset River. The areas around The Basin are popular spots for swimming in the ice-cold mountain-fed water. The range is crossed north‚Äìsouth by U.S. Route 3 and Interstate 93 through Franconia Notch and New Hampshire Route 16 through Pinkham Notch, and east‚Äìwest by the Kancamagus Highway (part of New Hampshire Route 112) through Kancamagus Pass and U.S. Route 302 through Crawford Notch. Many of these highways are designated as scenic routes. Several amusement parks lie in or near the White Mountains, including Story Land, Santa's Village, Whale's Tale Water Park and Clark's Trading Post. The White Mountains region is also home to numerous hiking attractions through the various river gorges, ravines, and caves in the area. The Flume Gorge, Lost River Reservation and Polar Caves Park all provide moderate hikes that one can complete in a few hours. Skiing is a popular attraction in the area. Cannon Mountain Ski Area, Loon Mountain Ski Resort, Attitash Mountain Resort, Wildcat Mountain Ski Area, Bretton Woods Mountain Resort, and Waterville Valley Resort are all popular winter ski resorts, and many of them provide year-round outdoor activities such as bridle paths, hiking trails, alpine slides, and the like. The Mount Washington Hotel located in Bretton Woods was the site of the Bretton Woods Conference following World War II, and today remains one of the few early twentieth century grand hotels still in use. Mapping Map of the White Mountains, Franklin Leavitt, 1871 Some of the earliest maps of the White Mountains were produced as tourist maps and not topographical maps. One of the first two tourist maps of the mountains was that produced by Franklin Leavitt, a self-taught artist born near Lancaster, New Hampshire in 1824.Franklin Leavitt, Map of the White Mountains, New Hampshire, WhiteMountainHistory.org Leavitt's hand-drawn map, today in the collection of Harvard University, is largely folk art, but does convey some of the region's features.Franklin Leavitt White Mountains Map, Harvard University Leavitt drew several versions of his map, beginning in 1852. The fourth version, printed in 1871, was printed at Boston and carried a retail price of one dollar.1871 Franklin Leavitt Map, WhiteMountainHistory.org Other early maps of the region were drawn by H. Conant and by Harvard astronomer George Phillips Bond, who published the first topographical map of the region in 1853.George P. Bond: Map of the White Mountains of New Hampshire, WhiteMountainHistory.org Art The White Mountains drew hundreds of painters during the 19th century. This group of artists is sometimes referred to as belonging to the \\"White Mountain school\\" of art. Others dispute the notion that these painters were a \\"school\\", since they did not all paint in the same style as, for example, those artists of the Hudson River School. In literature and drama Nathaniel Hawthorne chose the White Mountains as the setting for his short story \\"The Great Carbuncle\\". Other White Mountain tales by Hawthorne include \\"The Ambitious Guest\\", \\"Sketches from Memory\\" and \\"The Great Stone Face\\". The White Mountain region also figures prominently in the writings of Louisa May Alcott, including the novel Eight Cousins and its sequel, Rose in Bloom.

While NTL had its headquarters in New York City, the company's activities focused heavily on the United Kingdom, with operational headquarters in Hook, Hampshire. NTL became the dominant cable operator in the United Kingdom, controlling more than 90% of the market. In 2005 residential services generated 78% of NTL's revenue, and business services 22%. In March 2006, NTL merged with fellow cable telecom company Telewest, and created 'NTL:Telewest', which then also merged with Virgin Mobile UK and Virgin.net in June 2006, creating the UK's first \\"quadruple play\\" telecom provider, offering television, internet, landline phone and mobile phone services. In February 2007, NTL:Telewest was rebranded as Virgin Media.  History  = 1992‚Äì2006 = Barclay Knapp and George Blumenthal, the founders of American cellular network company Cellular Communications, Inc. (sold to Airtouch in 1996), established International CableTel in 1993 to take advantage of the deregulation of the UK cable market. Initially, Cabletel acquired local cable franchises covering Guildford and parts of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In 1996 CableTel acquired National Transcommunications Limited (NTL), the privatised UK Independent Broadcasting Authority transmission-network. In May 1998 CableTel adopted \\"NTL\\" as its new name. The company spent heavily: both on expanding its network and on acquiring rivals (in 1999, it acquired Cambridge Cable, one of the earliest digital networks, that had been installed across the university city ten years earlier). The company also began to expand outside the UK in 2000, buying into markets on continental Europe and Ireland. A collapse of the telecommunications markets from mid-2000 dealt a serious blow to the company. This, combined with NTL's rapid acquisition of local cable-operators, led to severe integration problems. NTL, struggling to cope with rapid expansion and suffering from significant customer-service problems, then had to contend with the setting up in November 2002 of one of the UK's first consumer lobby- groups, nthellworld, with ntl:hell following shortly after. As a complementary move, a team of NTL employees founded the website, Chetnet.co.uk, to provide customers with a site focused on providing expert advice on its subject- matter, based on factual information, without the emotion or speculation of the \\"lobby groups\\". Devalued and struggling with debts of around $18bn, NTL had to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy-protection in May 2002 in order to organise a refinancing deal. The company did not emerge from protection until January 2003, having converted around $11bn of debt into shares ‚Äî technically, this amounted to the largest debt default in US corporate history. The company reduced its debt to $6.4bn. A re-organisation split NTL itself into NTL Inc. (covering the UK and Irish markets) and NTL Europe Inc. (for the French, Swiss and German parts of the corporation). New executives replaced the NTL president, CEO and co-founder Barclay Knapp, as well as Stephen Carter, the MD and COO. After exiting from Chapter 11 protection NTL produced an operating profit. In 2004, it announced plans to split the broadcasting division off from the main company. In December 2004, NTL sold its broadcast-unit to a consortium led by Macquarie Communications Infrastructure Group (MCG) for ¬£1.27 billion. (Macquarie renamed the division Arqiva in May 2005.) This sale allowed NTL to focus on its \\"core businesses\\" of providing communications packages and cable services. In late 2004, NTL purchased the remaining shares of the Internet service provider (ISP) virgin.net, originally a joint venture between NTL and Richard Branson's Virgin Group. By 2005, its UK network consisted of a 7,800 km fibre backbone with the potential to reach 8.4 million residential homes and around 610,000 businesses. In January of that year, NTL started rolling out video on demand. With content selected by NTL, this service covered genres including music videos, children's programming and adult entertainment, as an extension to the basic 'pay per view' services the company offered for film and sport content. The new service allowed customers to rewind, fast forward and pause content. Despite NTL Ireland turning a profit, in May 2005, NTL sold their Dublin, Galway, and Waterford cable business (which they had acquired in 1999 for ‚Ç¨825 million from the Irish government) to UGC Europe for ‚Ç¨325 million ‚Äì this after having spent in excess of ‚Ç¨100 million on network infrastructure, resulting in a loss of ‚Ç¨500 million, more than 50% of the purchase price. Liberty Global continued to use the NTL brand in Ireland, but was eventually merged with Chorus Communications and rebranded as UPC Ireland in May 2010. By July 2005, NTL had cut its debt to ¬£1.445 billion with an operating cashflow of ¬£178 million. The company had 3.2 million customers buying at least one service from them, with the 1.4 million subscribers to broadband services making NTL the market leader in this field. = Telewest = = NTL/Telewest merger = From late 2003 discussions commenced on a merger between Telewest and NTL. Thanks to their geographically different areas, NTL and Telewest had co-operated previously, as in re- directing potential customers living outside their respective areas. On 3 October 2005, NTL announced a USD$6 billion purchase of Telewest, forming one of the largest media companies in the UK. The merger agreement as structured would have left NTL having to negotiate with BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, due to a change-of-ownership clause written into the agreement for UKTV, a joint venture with Telewest's Flextech content division. To prevent this, Telewest instead acquired NTL. The parties completed the merger on 3 March 2006, making the merged company the UK's largest cable-provider, with more than 90% of the market. Once merged, the combined company renamed itself to ntl:Telewest, with ex-NTL shareholders controlling 75% of the stock and ex-Telewest shareholders 25%. Nine of the eleven directors of the new board came from NTL and two from Telewest. = Virgin Mobile merger = In December 2005 NTL and Virgin Mobile announced that talks had taken place regarding a merger. Virgin Mobile's independent directors rejected the original bid of ¬£817 million ($1.4 billion), taking the view that NTL's bid \\"undervalued the business\\". Sir Richard Branson reportedly expressed confidence that a re-structured deal could go ahead, and in January 2006 NTL increased its offer to ¬£961m (372p per share). On 4 April 2006, NTL Incorporated announced a ¬£962.4m recommended offer for Virgin Mobile. According to reports, Branson accepted a mix of shares and cash, making him a 10.7% shareholder of the combined company. The takeover, which was completed on 4 July 2006, created the UK's first 'quadruple play' media company, bringing together television, Internet broadband, mobile-phone and fixed-line phone services. The deal included a 30-year exclusive branding agreement that saw NTL adopt the Virgin name across its consumer operations as it merged operations with its current Telewest brand. As a result, on 8 November 2006, NTL announced it would change its name to Virgin Media Plc. = Proposed ITV merger = In November 2006, NTL announced that it had approached commercial television broadcaster ITV about a proposed merger. BSkyB effectively blocked the merger on 12 November 2006, when it controversially bought a 17.9% stake in ITV plc, a move that attracted anger from NTL shareholder Richard Branson and an investigation from media and telecoms regulator Ofcom. On 6 December 2006, NTL announced that it had complained to the Office of Fair Trading about BSkyB's move, and that it would withdraw its attempt to buy ITV plc, stating that it did not believe that it could currently make a deal on favourable terms.  Services  = Internet = NTL offered broadband Internet access connections through cable. The service operates through SACMs (Stand-alone cable modems) and set-top boxes (STBs). In NTL areas customers could also access a 512 kbit/s download-speed; and both NTL and Telewest offer dial-up Internet services on a pay-as-you-go basis, or at a fixed monthly fee of ¬£14.99 for unlimited usage. The broadband services did not have a bandwidth- cap or a fair-usage policy; this means that customers have unlimited usage and need pay no extra charges related to the amount of data downloaded. However NTL has admitted introducing traffic shaping. NTL started trialling 20 Mbit/s, and temporarily upgraded some 10 Mbit/s subscribers to this speed in October 2006. Furthermore, NTL started conducting trials of a 100Mbit broadband service on its cable network.http://www.digitalmediaasia.com/default.asp?ArticleID=13405 After trials in the Guildford area from mid-1999, NTL launched its original broadband services at the same time that NTL acquired the Cable business of Cable and Wireless (early 2000). In the \\"original NTL\\" (also known as \\"Langley\\") areas, NTL has always supplied broadband services via DOCSIS cable- modems. In these areas the digital television set-top boxes used an incompatible standard, DAVIC. Initially, NTL decided to terminate service to approximately 90,000 ex-Cable and Wireless subscribers on short notice. This threatened to leave customers stranded and without access to their email or websites and was due to NTL's lack of infrastructure capability in some areas. Before termination of services, Boltblue struck a deal with NTL and Cable and Wireless Communications to save 90,000 and later an additional 210,000 customers. The roll-out of broadband services in the ex-Cable and Wireless franchises started in mid 2001. NTL provided ex-Cable and Wireless subscribers with broadband through the set-top box (STB) also used for digital television services, adopting the rationale that subscribers could self-install. Initially, NTL supplied a \\"Self Install Kit\\" consisting of connecting cable, adapters and an install CD. Following demonstrated problems, NTL gradually introduced cable modems and phased out the self-install approach. The Pace STBs proved highly problematic, exhibiting two major flaws. Firstly, large numbers of connections (for example, those with peer-to-peer (P2P) software) would cause the connection to slow down and eventually freeze the modem part of the STB (also required for interactive TV services, which suffered a similar effect when downloading). Customers in these circumstances had to re- boot the STB. Secondly, the single processor and sharing the internal modem between television and broadband services made the television part of the box slow and unresponsive, for example making it extremely difficult to change channel using the remote. This became particularly evident when using the lower \\"Tiers of Service\\" such the 128 kbit/s downstream 64 kbit/s upstream, as the digital television set-top box without broadband service actually enjoyed a 256 kbit/s upstream. Although capable of higher speeds (up to 4 Mbit/s), NTL did not make speeds higher than 1 Mbit/s available due to degradation of the DTV service. NTL eventually replaced the Pace set-top boxes with Samsung models that used a dual-processor architecture, overcoming the shortcomings of the Pace, and capable of much better downstream performance. However, with the advent of higher \\"Tiers of Service\\" of 10 Mbit/s downstream and higher, plus the reducing cost of NTL's cable modems (supplied by Ambit Broadband) NTL now supplies all subscribers with cable modems. A historical view of NTL cable modems appears online at the Chetnet site. The NTL network runs through transparent proxy servers. Up to 15 server addresses host each area. These transparent proxy servers also override the user's hosts file and prevent manual DNS updates. This makes it easier for NTL to provide a more reliable connection as well as being able to monitor traffic requirements in each area. This also causes many problems for websites which record IP addresses to ban and/or track users. This means that if a website bans one offender, it bans everyone in the same area. Also, many on-line games automatically ban IP addresses with multiple usernames associated with them. Small-scale games do not cause too many problems, but when friends attempt to spread the game around, the system prevents everyone (including the original player) from using the game. On the other hand, advanced users can easily create a large number of illegitimate accounts on the aforementioned websites, allowing one user both to prevent all other users on the NTL network using the game, as well as to become untraceable. NTL has used MAC addresses to track and register customers to the NTL internet service. As NTL had not supported the use of routers, or Xbox on the minority Set Top Box based Broadband Internet service, users had to use a clone MAC address feature to connect to the Internet when using an STB. This has become a common problem for people wishing to connect their Xbox to the existing internet connection through a router or PC connected to their STB, if they fail to use the official registration process. (These comments do not apply to the majority (>90%) use of cable modems). = Television = The digital television service offered a number of different products including true video on demand, a PVR, and HDTV. On 1 September 2006, NTL introduced the FreeTV digital package to its telephone subscribers free of charge. However, value-pack customers lost their value-pack discounts if they integrate the FreeTV deal into their existing packages.  PVR and high definition services  NTL launched TV Drive, its high-definition television (HDTV) and Digital Video Recorder (PVR) service in Glasgow and Teesside on 16 November 2006. The service relied on the service of the same name offered in NTL's Telewest areas. The service used a new PVR set-top-box, with three tuners and a 160GB hard disk for up to 80 hours recording. The presence of three tuners meant that the TV Drive could record two channels at the same time while watching a third. This contrasts with most other PVR systems such as Sky+, which can only have two tuners.  Video on demand  NTL started to roll out its Video on Demand (VoD) service branded \\"NTL On Demand\\". NTL On Demand uses the Teleport system on Telewest's network. In contrast to Sky which, due to technical limitations, could only provide near-VOD services, NTL On Demand provided a true VoD system. The service allowed customers of NTL Digital television to download programmes as and when they want to watch them from servers at the customer's local head-end. As the broadcaster automatically stored content on NTL's servers, it removed the need to pre-record many programmes. Users could search through a large library of programmes and watch them when they want to as part of their subscription. This library included a free 7-day watch-again feature for TV-programmes produced by the BBC, Channel 4 and Flextech. NTL also offered other television-shows, films (service branded FilmFlex), and music videos, mostly for an additional fee. The VoD service also provided HD content that would work in conjunction with the TV Drive PVR.  Fixed-line telephone  NTL also provided telephone services to its customers, as the second-largest fixed-line telephony provider in the UK, behind BT, who until 1984 held the monopoly on fixed-line telephony services in the UK. In 2003, revenue from mobile lines became greater than the fixed-line telephone revenue.  Premium TV  Premium TV was a subsidiary of NTL. It purchased stakes in Rangers F.C., Celtic F.C., Aston Villa F.C., Middlesbrough F.C., Newcastle United F.C. and Leicester City F.C. The investments included interest free loans to the clubs to act as their exclusive agent for the sale of media sponsorship, advertising and publishing rights across all media platforms, including ownership of the clubs live television and radio rights. Premium TV operated and fully funded Boro TV for Middlesbrough F.C. from February 1998. Boro TV Extra was added in August 2001, taking advantage of the relaxation in the TV rights regulations. Both channels were closed in July 2005 after NTL withdrew funding. On 14 June 2000, NTL won the rights to show 40 live Premier League matches on a pay-per-view basis for three years, beginning at the start of the 2001‚Äì02 season. NTL would pay approximately ¬£109 million per annum for the rights. NTL pulled out of the deal on 18 October 2000, claiming that it was \\"unable to agree final terms\\". The failure to complete the deal, led to a lack of confidence in their proposed 2005 joint bid with ITV plc. On 19 June 2000, NTL entered into a joint venture with The Football League to set up an internet portal for all 72 clubs. Under the terms of the deal, NTL would pay rights fees of up to ¬£65 million over five years, with all participating clubs sharing in the profits of the joint venture, with a variable term in the region of 20 years. Premium TV was eventually able to set up 78 football club websites after adding its partially owned clubs. The deal had with The Football League had to be renegotiated in September 2002 after NTL could no longer afford to pay its instalments. The League clubs would now receive ¬£5m and an 80-per-cent share of all future revenue earned by the venture until the total amount reaches the original figure of ¬£35m. NTL, through Premium TV, launched the ITN News Channel, a joint venture with ITN, on 1 August 2000. In June 2002, Carlton Television and Granada Television - the predecessors of ITV plc - bought out ITN's 65-per-cent stake. This led to a rebrand as the ITV News Channel in September 2002. In April 2004 the newly created ITV plc bought NTL's remaining 35-per-cent stake to assume full control of the channel. Premium TV also oversaw NTL's 49-per-cent share in pay-per-view movie service Front Row, in joint venture with Telewest and NTL's 48.1-per-cent stake in interactive television technology and games firm, Two Way TV. Premium TV also operated Lions TV between June and August 2001, covering 2001 British Lions tour to Australia. The channel showcased eight, one hour 'behind the scenes' programmes to be made by Premium TV. Premium TV also provided the funds to create programming specifically for the UK feed (British Eurosport) of the pan-European channel Eurosport. It did not have a stake in the sports channel, but got a share of revenue. Premium TV planned to launch a live sports channel in September 2001 called British Sport, which would have combined archive footage from the BBC with live coverage of rugby union, basketball and ice hockey. Premium TV dropped its plans after realising it could not compete with other sports broadcasters, such as ITV and BSkyB. Instead Premium TV chose to launch a channel with the working title of Classic Sport, offering classic BBC sports footage from the Grandstand archives, the channel never materialised. The Ice Hockey Superleague issued a high court writ claiming damages of up to ¬£10m from the company, after its ¬£1m-a-year TV deal was cancelled at short notice. The Superleague settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Premium TV was spun-out of NTL's UK cable operations and into NTL Europe Inc. in 2002, as part of a rescue plan devised by Barclay Knapp. Premium TV was placed under the control of the crisis and turnaround advisory group, Quest Turnaround Advisors. Quest negotiated commercial contracts with joint venture partners to eliminate ¬£43 million of parent company guarantees and generated $10 million cash through restructuring. At the same time, Quest doubled paid subscribers to 75,000, cut staff by 50-per-cent, and broke even within 15 months of taking control. The business was then sold business for $54 million to Access Industries, who merged it with Inform Group in 2007 to create Perform.  Broadcasting  NTL owned Flextech, a content-provider with a number of wholly owned channels (including Bravo and LIVINGtv). Additionally, Flextech had a 50% share in UKTV (with BBC Worldwide), and owned Sit-Up Ltd, who operated Screenshop, bid TV, price-drop TV and speed auction TV. In February 2001, NTL and Vivendi Universal launched The Studio, a 50:50 joint venture film channel which closed in January 2003.

It was written by the male passengers of the Mayflower, consisting of separatist Puritans, adventurers, and tradesmen. The Puritans were fleeing from religious persecution by King James I of England. The Mayflower Compact was signed aboard ship on , 1620. Signing the covenant were 41 of the ship's 101 passengers while the Mayflower was anchored in Provincetown Harbor within the hook at the northern tip of Cape Cod.  Reasons for the Compact  The Pilgrims had originally hoped to reach America in early October using two ships, but delays and complications meant they could use only one, the Mayflower. Their intended destination had been the Colony of Virginia, with the journey financed by the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London. Storms forced them to anchor at the hook of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, however, as it was unwise to continue with provisions running short. This inspired some of the non-Puritan passengers (whom the Puritans referred to as 'Strangers') to proclaim that they \\"would use their own liberty; for none had power to command them\\" since they would not be settling in the agreed-upon Virginia territory. To prevent this, the Pilgrims determined to establish their own government, while still affirming their allegiance to the Crown of England. Thus, the Mayflower Compact was based simultaneously upon a majoritarian model and the settlers' allegiance to the king. It was in essence a social contract in which the settlers consented to follow the community's rules and regulations for the sake of order and survival. The Pilgrims had lived for some years in Leiden, a city in the Dutch Republic. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick states, \\"Just as a spiritual covenant had marked the beginning of their congregation in Leiden, a civil covenant would provide the basis for a secular government in America.\\"Nathaniel Philbrick (2006), Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War, Penguin Book, New York, N.Y., , p. 41  Text  Bradford's transcription of the Compact The original document has been lost, but three versions exist from the 17th century: printed in Mourt's Relation (1622), which was reprinted in Purchas his Pilgrimes (1625); hand-written by William Bradford in his journal Of Plimoth Plantation (1646); and printed by Bradford's nephew Nathaniel Morton in New-Englands Memorial (1669). The three versions differ slightly in wording and significantly in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. William Bradford wrote the first part of Mourt's Relation, including its version of the compact, so he wrote two of the three versions. The wording of those two versions is quite similar, unlike that of Morton. Bradford's handwritten manuscript is kept in a vault at the State Library of Massachusetts. Modern version The document was signed on .  Signers  1920 U.S. postage stamp depicting the signing of the compact A list of 41 male passengers who signed the document was supplied by Bradford's nephew Nathaniel Morton in his 1669 New England's Memorial. Thomas Prince first numbered the names in his 1736 A Chronological History of New-England in the form of Annals. The original document has been lost, so Morton is the sole source for the signers. He probably had access to the original document, but he could not have known the actual order in which it was signed simply by inspecting it. Morton's arrangement of names might not have been the arrangement on the original document, and the names on the original may not have been arranged in any orderly fashion. Prince's numbers are based solely on Morton, as he himself stated. Morton's list of names was unnumbered and untitled in all six editions (1669‚Äì1855), although their order changed with successive editions. In his original 1669 edition, the names were placed on two successive pages forming six short columns, three per page. In subsequent editions, these six short columns were combined into three long columns on a single page in two different ways, producing two different orders in unnumbered lists of signers. The second (1721) and third (1772) editions changed the order of the first edition by combining the first and fourth columns into the first long column, and similarly for the other columns. The fifth (1826) and sixth (1855) editions returned the names to their original first edition order by combining the first and second short columns into the first long column, and similarly for the other columns. Prince numbered the names in their original 1669 Morton order. He added titles (Mr. or Capt.) to 11 names that were given those titles by William Bradford in the list of passengers at the end of his manuscript. The following list of signers is organized into the six short columns of Morton (1669) with the numbers and titles of Prince. The names are given their modern spelling according to Morison. Use the numbers for the order used by genealogists and half of unnumbered lists (Samuel Fuller will be the eighth name), but merge the half columns vertically into full columns for the order used by the other half of unnumbered lists (John Turner will be the eighth name).

In chemistry, an enantiomer ( ; ) (also named optical isomer, antipode, or optical antipode) is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are mirror images of each other that cannot appear identical simply by reorientation. A single chiral atom or similar structural feature in a compound causes that compound to have two possible structures which are non-superposable, each a mirror image of the other. Each member of the pair is termed an enantiomorph (enantio = opposite; morph = form); the structural property is termed enantiomerism. The presence of multiple chiral features in a given compound increases the number of geometric forms possible, though there may still be some perfect-mirror-image pairs. A sample of a chemical is considered enantiopure (also termed enantiomerically pure) when it has, within the limits of detection, molecules of only one chirality. When present in a symmetric environment, enantiomers have identical chemical and physical properties except for their ability to rotate plane-polarized light (+/‚àí) by equal amounts but in opposite directions (although the polarized light can be considered an asymmetric medium). Such compounds are therefore described as optically active, with specific terms for each enantiomer based on the direction: a dextrorotatory compound rotates light a clockwise (+) direction whereas a levorotatory compound rotates light in a counter-clockwise (‚Äì) direction. A mixture of equal number of both enantiomers is called a racemic mixture or a racemate. In a racemic mixture, the amount of positive rotation is exactly counteracted by the equal amount of negative rotation, so the net rotation is zero (the mixture is not optically active). For all intents and purposes, pairs of enantiomers have the same Gibbs free energy. However, theoretical physics predicts that due to parity violation of the weak nuclear force (the only force in nature that can \\"tell left from right\\"), there is actually a minute difference in energy between enantiomers (on the order of 10‚àí12 eV or 10‚àí10 kJ/mol or less) due to the weak neutral current mechanism. This difference in energy is far smaller than energy changes caused by even a trivial change in molecular conformation and far too small to measure by current technology, and is therefore chemically inconsequential.In the sense used by particle physicists (see ref. 6), the \\"true\\" enantiomer of a molecule, which has exactly the same mass-energy content as the original molecule, is a mirror-image, but also built from antimatter (antiprotons, antineutrons, and positrons). Nevertheless, in this article, \\"enantiomer\\" will be used in the chemical sense and continue to refer to a nonidentical, mirror-image isomeric compound, consisting of ordinary matter elementary particles, in particular. Enantiomer members often have different chemical reactions with other enantiomer substances. Since many biological molecules are enantiomers, there is sometimes a marked difference in the effects of two enantiomers on biological organisms. In drugs, for example, often only one of a drug's enantiomers is responsible for the desired physiological effects, while the other enantiomer is less active, inactive, or sometimes even productive of adverse effects. Owing to this discovery, drugs composed of only one enantiomer (\\"enantiopure\\") can be developed to make the drug work better and sometimes eliminate some side effects. An example is eszopiclone (Lunesta), which is just a single enantiomer of an older racemic drug called zopiclone. One enantiomer is responsible for all the desired effects, while the other enantiomer seems to be inactive, so the dose of eszopiclone is half that of zopiclone. In chemical synthesis of enantiomeric substances, non-enantiomeric precursors inevitably produce racemic mixtures. In the absence of an effective enantiomeric environment (precursor, chiral catalyst, or kinetic resolution), separation of a racemic mixture into its enantiomeric components is impossible, although certain racemic mixtures spontaneously crystallize in the form of a racemic conglomerate, in which crystals of the enantiomers are physically segregated and may be separated mechanically (e.g., the enantiomers of tartaric acid, whose crystallized enantiomers were separated with tweezers by Pasteur). However, most racemates will crystallize in crystals containing both enantiomers in a 1:1 ratio, arranged in a regular lattice. Naming conventions The R/S system is an important nomenclature system used to denote distinct enantiomers. Another system is based on prefix notation for optical activity: (+)- and (‚àí)- or d- and l-. The Latin words for left are laevus and sinister, and the word for right is dexter (or rectus in the sense of correct or virtuous). The English word right is a cognate of rectus. This is the origin of the L/D and S/R notations, and the employment of prefixes levo- and dextro- in common names. The prefix ent- to a chemical name can be used to refer to the chemical that is the enantiomer of the one indicated by the name.  Criterion of enantiomerism  Fischer projection of meso-tartaric acid An asymmetric carbon atom is one which has bonds with four different atoms or groups, so that these bonds can be arranged in two different ways which are not superposable. Most compounds that contain one or more asymmetric carbon (or other element with a tetrahedral geometry) atoms show enantiomerism, but this is not always true. Compounds that contain two or more asymmetric carbon atoms but have a plane of symmetry with respect to the whole molecule are known as meso compounds. A meso compound does not have a mirror image stereoisomer because it is its own mirror image (i.e., it and its mirror image are the same molecule). For instance, meso tartaric acid (shown on the right) has two asymmetric carbon atoms, but it does not exhibit enantiomerism because each of the two halves of the molecule is equal and opposite to the other and thus is superposable on its geometric mirror image. Conversely, there exist forms of chirality that do not require individual asymmetric atoms. In fact, there are four distinct types of chirality: central, axial, planar, and helical chirality. Having an enantiomer by virtue of an asymmetric carbon atom represents the most common type of central chirality. The other three types of chirality do not involve asymmetric carbon atoms, and even central chirality does not require the center of chirality to be located at a carbon or any other atom. Consequently, while the presence of an asymmetric carbon atom is a convenient characteristic to look for when determining whether a molecule will have an enantiomer, it is neither sufficient nor necessary as a criterion. As a rigorous criterion, a molecule is chiral, and will therefore possess an enantiomer, if and only if it belongs to one of the chiral point groups: Cn, Dn, T, O, and I. However, as a caveat, enantiomers are not necessarily isolable if there is an accessible pathway for racemization at a given temperature and timescale. For example, amines with three distinct substituents are chiral, but with the exception of only a few atypical cases (e.g. substituted N-chloroaziridines), they rapidly planarize and invert (\\"umbrella inversion\\") at room temperature, leading to racemization. If the racemization is fast enough, the molecule can often be treated as an achiral, averaged structure.  Examples  Structures of the two enantiomeric forms (S left, R right) of mecoprop Enantiomers of citalopram. The top is (R)-citalopram and the bottom is (S)-citalopram. An example of such an enantiomer is the sedative thalidomide, which was sold in a number of countries around the world from 1957 until 1961. It was withdrawn from the market when it was found to cause birth defects. One enantiomer caused the desirable sedative effects, while the other, unavoidably present in equal quantities, caused birth defects. The herbicide mecoprop is a racemic mixture, with the (R)-(+)-enantiomer (\\"Mecoprop-P\\", \\"Duplosan KV\\") possessing the herbicidal activity. Another example is the antidepressant drugs escitalopram and citalopram. Citalopram is a racemate [1:1 mixture of (S)-citalopram and (R)-citalopram]; escitalopram [(S)-citalopram] is a pure enantiomer. The dosages for escitalopram are typically 1/2 of those for citalopram. Enantioselective preparations There are two main strategies for the preparation of enantiopure compounds. The first is known as chiral resolution. This method involves preparing the compound in racemic form, and separating it into its isomers. In his pioneering work, Louis Pasteur was able to isolate the isomers of tartaric acid because they crystallize from solution as crystals each with a different symmetry. A less common method is by enantiomer self-disproportionation. The second strategy is asymmetric synthesis: the use of various techniques to prepare the desired compound in high enantiomeric excess. Techniques encompassed include the use of chiral starting materials (chiral pool synthesis), the use of chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts, and the application of asymmetric induction. The use of enzymes (biocatalysis) may also produce the desired compound. Enantioconvergent synthesis is the synthesis of one enantiomer from a racemic precursor molecule utilizing both enantiomers. Thus, the two enantiomers of the reactant produce a single enantiomer of product. Enantiopure medications Advances in industrial chemical processes have made it economic for pharmaceutical manufacturers to take drugs that were originally marketed as a racemic mixture and market the individual enantiomers. In some cases, the enantiomers have genuinely different effects. In other cases, there may be no clinical benefit to the patient. In some jurisdictions, single-enantiomer drugs are separately patentable from the racemic mixture. It is possible that only one of the enantiomers is active. Or, it may be that both are active, in which case separating the mixture has no objective benefits, but extends the drug's patentability. Quasi-enantiomers Quasi-enantiomers are molecular species that are not strictly enantiomers, but behave as if they are. Quasi- enantiomers have applications in parallel kinetic resolution.G.S.

The centre of West Norwood sits in a bowl surrounded by hillsides on its east, west and south sides. From many parts of the area, distant views can be seen, of places such as the City of London, Canary Wharf and Crystal Palace. In March 2016 planning permission was granted to build a new 4 screen Picturehouse Cinema and cafe in Nettlefold Hall, which had previously closed in 2011. The new complex opened in November 2018 and additionally re-homes the council library service back to Nettlefold Hall. The West Norwood Feast, a monthly community market running across several areas of West Norwood, has been active since 2011. Featuring music, stalls and community events, the feast has been hugely popular. West Norwood Health and Leisure Centre was opened in 2014. This is located on Devane Way, and offers leisure facilities including a full sized swimming pool, gym, dance studio, community space as well as health resources, both GP and dental. West Norwood includes some or all of three Wards of the London Borough of Lambeth - Gipsy Hill, Knights Hill and Thurlow Park. Each of these wards is represented on Lambeth Council by three councillors. Transport The area is well served by public transport with these National Rail stations at each end of the main shopping area in Norwood Road, providing the services shown to central London and beyond: * West Norwood - services to Victoria, Clapham Junction and London Bridge. * Tulse Hill - services to Victoria, London Bridge, London Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon, Luton Airport, Kings Cross, St Pancras and St Albans. Trains also run from both these stations to a variety of destinations further south of the centre of London. Other nearby railway stations are: * Gipsy Hill * Herne Hill * West Dulwich The tube stations closest to West Norwood are at Brixton and Balham, both of which can be reached by bus and, in the case of Balham, also by train. Eight daytime bus routes and two night-time routes serve the area. West Norwood bus garage is located at Ernest Avenue. The South Circular (A205) passes close by at Tulse Hill and Streatham High Road (A23) is about one mile to the west of the centre of West Norwood.

There are a large number of other publicly funded and also private schools within a short distance of West Norwood. Landmarks These include: * South London Theatre Centre. This building was constructed in 1881 as West Norwood's first fire station and has a prominent watch tower. It was subsequently used as a church hall by St Luke's church before its present use commenced. In August 2014 the theatre was awarded a grant of ¬£1.6m by the Heritage Lottery Fund to enable restoration work, which is currently ongoing. * West Norwood Health and Leisure Centre, a ¬£14.2M million health and leisure centre opened in 2014. * St Luke's Church. One of four Lambeth Waterloo churches, the others are St Matthew, St Mark, and St John. Architect Francis Octavius Bedford designed this church and St John's in a similar neoclassical style. St Luke's was built between 1822 and 1825, and was reordered by G E Street in 1870‚Äì1872. Unusually for a church it is oriented north‚Äìsouth instead of east‚Äìwest. This is due to a requirement when Lambeth Manor was enclosed that no building in the area that included the site should be erected within 100 feet of an existing building without the permission of the owner of the other building. An objection from the owner of the Horn's Tavern meant St Luke's had to be built in a north‚Äìsouth orientation to avoid falling within 100 feet of the tavern.London County Council, The Survey of London: Volume 26, Lambeth: Southern Area (London: London County Council, 1956) pp.173-80 The lower part of the churchyard at St Luke's has been laid out as gardens and are used as one of the venues of the West Norwood Feast. * West Norwood Library & Nettlefold Hall, Norwood High Street. Princess Margaret opened the building in April 1969. The complex is now the West Norwood Picturehouse and library. * West Norwood Cemetery, one of London's Magnificent Seven Victorian burial places, with 66 listed structures, many in the Gothic style. Opened 1837. * The Old Library. In 2004 this has been a cafe and venue for local meetings, activities, exhibitions and events. The building opened on 21 July 1888 as the first public library in Lambeth and was designed by Sidney Smith, architect of Tate Britain and several other Lambeth libraries, using red brick, terracotta and Ham Hill stone, with a balcony above the entrance loggia. It was commissioned by Sir Henry Tate on land donated by Frederick Nettlefold: both of these local philanthropists are buried in West Norwood Cemetery. * Mrs Woodford Fawcett Fountain - on a traffic island in front of St Luke's Church, where Norwood Road splits into Norwood High Street and Knights Hill. Mrs Fawcett was a local temperance campaigner and is buried in West Norwood Cemetery whose entrance faces the fountain.  History  A map showing the Norwood ward of Lambeth Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. \\"Norwood\\" recalls the \\"Great North Wood\\", a name that was formerly used for the hilly and wooded area to the north of Croydon. Before 1885 West Norwood station and the surrounding area was known as \\"Lower Norwood\\", reflecting its being at a lower altitude than Upper Norwood. John Rocque's 1745 map of London and the surrounding area includes the Horns Tavern at Knight's Hill, opposite what is now the main entrance to West Norwood station, with a largely undeveloped valley stretching to 'Island Green' in the north, approximately where Herne Hill railway station stands now. The enclosure map of 50 years later shows that little of the original woodland remained by then, other than a few coppices. The future development of West Norwood was assisted by the Lambeth Manor Enclosure Act of 1806. Much of the land covered by this Act was owned either by the Archbishop of Canterbury or by Lord Thurlow, who died in the same year. Most of the current main roads were either ancient or laid out in accordance with the provisions of the enclosure award. The River Effra ran alongside the current Elder Road, in a northerly direction, and was prone to flooding. The area was over a mile from the nearest parish church (at St Leonard, Streatham), so St. Luke's was provided under the Waterloo church scheme and completed in 1825. The houses in the parish at that period consisted largely of substantial villas along the main roads and more humble cottages mainly situated between Knights Hill and the High Street. The South Metropolitan Cemetery was laid out in 1837 to provide burial facilities largely for the population of crowded areas that were closer to the centre of London. The railway line from London to the Crystal Palace was opened in 1856 with a station at Lower Norwood (since renamed West Norwood). These improved communications heralded major changes. Many of the larger houses and gardens were demolished and replaced with predominantly more modest housing over the next four decades. Norwood High Street contained the earliest group of shops in the area but never developed into a major shopping centre, as the main shopping parades were built during the decades around 1900 along Norwood Road between York Hill and West Norwood station. Horse-drawn trams shuttled passengers along this road from the terminus in front of St Luke's Church towards the middle of London. Extensive anecdotal and other historical material from the 19th and early 20th centuries has been written up by Mr J B Wilson, a local undertaker.J.B. Wilson & H.A. Wilson The Story of Norwood The two world wars witnessed fatalities and bomb damage to many buildings in the area, with York Hill and the areas around the railway suffering particularly badly. Chatsworth Baptist church had to be rebuilt after a direct hit. Many of the post-war estates were built on bomb sites or replaced areas which had experienced damage. An Art Deco cinema, named The Regal, was built at 304 Norwood Road in the late 1920s. It was designed by architect F Edward Jones (who also designed Madame Tussaud's) and opened on 16 January 1930. The cinema sat 2,010 and was equipped with a Christie Manual organ. The cinema closed on 8 February 1964 with a double screening of Peter Sellers' I'm Alright Jack and Two Way Stretch. Following its closure, the building became a Top Rank Bingo Club a few months later and remained open until 1978. The building was demolished in November 1981 and a B&Q; store can be seen today on the site. After the Second World War, a considerable amount of council housing was constructed in West Norwood. The York Hill, Fern Lodge, Portobello and Holderness Estates arose during the late 1940s and the 1950s on the sites of houses with large gardens that had been destroyed by bombing or were simply demolished. Later houses and flats, such as in the Dunbar Street area, took the place of Victorian dwellings that were cleared away as slums or, alternatively, to achieve a higher density of development. The Woodvale Estate in Elder Road was erected on the site of the \\"Lambeth New Schools\\", which had been part of the local Workhouse and that had been renamed as \\"Wood Vale\\" before demolition. Parts of West Norwood have been declared conservation areas including the area around the cemetery, Lancaster Avenue and Rosendale Road. Local landmarks such as St Luke's Church, the late Victorian fire station (now the South London Theatre) on Norwood High Street, by the architect Robert Pearsall., The early 20th-century former fire station at Norwood Road and the original public library at Knights Hill are Grade II listed buildings. =Knights Hill= Confusingly, there are two areas called Knight's Hill nearby; the names of both areas have similar origins, both belonging to Thomas Knyght in 1545, and in the south was known as Knight's Hill Common while the hill to the north was known as Knight's Hill Farm. * The better-known area is the residential area and electoral ward to the south west by the road called Knights Hill. The southern Knight's Hill Common originally formed part of Lambeth Manor and contained land called Julian's, which is remembered through the street name of St Julian's Farm Road. The hill formed the nucleus of the vast estate in Lambeth and Streatham that Lord Thurlow acquired during the 18th Century, * The second Knight's Hill is above the Tulse Hill railway tunnel, near West Dulwich railway station - which was originally called Lower Knights Hill station. It includes the hilly land between the western end of Thurlow Park Road (South Circular), Peabody Hill and Lovelace Road, and is now partly used by Rosendale Allotments in SE21. The green area is still marked as Knight's Hill on large scale maps but is normally not marked as such on modern street maps in order to avoid confusion. Originally, the northern Knight's Hill farm was part of the Manor of Levehurst, and later of the Manor of Leigham Court and the parish of Streatham.Ben Weinreb & Christopher Hibbert, The London Encyclopedia, West Norwood = The Jewish Orphanage = The main building of the Norwood Home for Jewish Children (\\"The Jewish Orphanage\\") was completed in 1862. It was a three-storey edifice, with the appearance of a Jacobean palace This structure was demolished in 1963, after the children had moved in groups to live in nine houses supervised by house parents in a less institutional environment, meeting for communal activities at a new synagogue built on the original site. In the 1970s, the charity moved out of the area and the main site was sold to Lambeth Council, which developed much of it for a housing estate, keeping only a small area beside the railway line as open space and converting the synagogue into a community facility known as the Norwood Hall. Some of this open space is now occupied by the West Norwood Health and Leisure Centre but the site of Norwood Hall has been landscaped. An account of a boy's experiences of living at the Orphanage between 1928 and 1933 can be found online. Of the original buildings only the porter's lodge off Knights Hill now remains, its curving Dutch-gables, red brick with black diaperwork and mullioned windows echoing the design of the main 3-storey institution. The Arnold & Jane Gabriel Home was built on the Wolfington Road frontage of the orphanage in 1910; it was converted into Julians primary school in 2012, which now features a colourful modern extension to the original building. The charity that operated the orphanage in West Norwood retains an echo of its previous location in its current name Norwood. =Historical local photographs= * Images of Norwood Churches During recent years, the number and variety of churches has increased, reflecting the diverse origins of many new residents.

On January 10, 1948, 15-year-old Loretta Webb married Oliver Vanetta \\"Doolittle\\" Lynn (August 27, 1926 - August 22, 1996), better known as \\"Doolittle\\", \\"Doo\\", or \\"Mooney\\". They had met only a month earlier. The Lynns left Kentucky and moved to the logging community of Custer, Washington, when Loretta was seven months pregnant with the first of their six children. The happiness and heartache of her early years of marriage would help to inspire Lynn's songwriting.Profile, lubbockonline.com; accessed July 18, 2015. In 1953, Doolittle bought her a $17 Harmony guitar. She taught herself to play the instrument, and over the following three years, she worked to improve her guitar playing. With Doolittle's encouragement, she started her own band, Loretta and the Trailblazers, with her brother Jay Lee playing lead guitar. She often appeared at Bill's Tavern in Blaine, Washington, and the Delta Grange Hall in Custer, Washington, with the Pen Brothers' band and the Westerneers. She cut her first record, \\"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl\\", in February 1960. She became a part of the country music scene in Nashville in the 1960s. In 1967, she had the first of 16 No. 1 hits, out of 70 charted songs as a solo artist and a duet partner.

Lynn focused on women's issues with themes about philandering husbands and persistent mistresses. Her music was inspired by issues she faced in her marriage. She increased the boundaries in the conservative genre of country music by singing about birth control (\\"The Pill\\"), repeated childbirth (\\"One's on the Way\\"), double standards for men and women (\\"Rated 'X'\\"), and being widowed by the draft during the Vietnam War (\\"Dear Uncle Sam\\"). Country music radio stations often refused to play her music, banning nine of her songs, but Lynn pushed on to become one of country music's legendary artists. Her bestselling 1976 autobiography, Coal Miner's Daughter, was made into an Academy Award‚Äìwinning film of the same title in 1980, starring Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones. Spacek won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Lynn. Her album Van Lear Rose, released in 2004, was produced by the alternative rock musician Jack White. Lynn and White were nominated for five Grammys and won two. Lynn has received numerous awards in country and American music.

It was a shuffle with a West Coast beat\\". The Lynns toured the country to promote the release to country stations, while Grashey and Del Roy took the music to KFOX in Long Beach, California. When the Lynns reached Nashville, the song was a hit, climbing to No. 14 on Billboard's Country and Western chart, and Lynn began cutting demo records for the Wilburn Brothers Publishing Company. Through the Wilburns, she secured a contract with Decca Records. The first Loretta Lynn Fan Club formed in November 1960. By the end of the year, Billboard magazine listed Lynn as the No. 4 Most Promising Country Female Artist. Lynn's relationship with the Wilburn Brothers and her appearances on the Grand Ole Opry, beginning in 1960, helped Lynn become the No. 1 female recording artist in country music. Her contract with the Wilburn Brothers gave them the publishing rights to her material. She unsuccessfully fought the Wilburn Brothers for 30 years to regain the publishing rights to her songs after ending her business relationship with them. Lynn stopped writing music in the 1970s because of the contracts. Lynn joined the Grand Ole Opry on September 25, 1962. Lynn has credited Patsy Cline as her mentor and best friend during her early years in music. In 2010, when interviewed for Jimmy McDonough's biography of Tammy Wynette, Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen, Lynn said of having best friends in Patsy and Tammy during different times: \\"Best friends are like husbands. You only need one at a time.\\" Lynn released her first Decca single, \\"Success,\\" in 1962, and it went straight to No. 6, beginning a string of top 10 singles that would run throughout the 1970s. Lynn's music began to regularly hit the Top 10 after 1964 with songs such as \\"Before I'm Over You\\", which peaked at No. 4, followed by \\"Wine, Women and Song,\\" which peaked at No. 3\\\\.

Lynn's label issued two albums that year, \\"Songs from My Heart\\" and \\"Blue Kentucky Girl\\". Lynn's first self-penned song to crack the Top 10, 1966's \\"Dear Uncle Sam\\", was among the first recordings to recount the human costs of the Vietnam War.

Lynn continued to reach the Top 10 until the end of the decade, including 1975's \\"The Pill\\", one of the first songs to discuss birth control.

In 1976, she released her autobiography, Coal Miner's Daughter, with the help of writer George Vecsey. It became a No. 1 bestseller, making Lynn the first country music artist to make The New York Times Best Seller list.

In 2013, Loretta's daughter, Betty Sue, died at age 64 of emphysema near Loretta's ranch in Hurricane Mills. Two years after her twins Peggy and Patsy were born, Lynn became a grandmother at age 34. =Marital problems= Lynn was married for almost 50 years until her husband died at age 69 in 1996. In her 2002 autobiography Still Woman Enough and in an interview with CBS News the same year, she recounted how her husband cheated on her regularly and once left her while she was giving birth. Lynn and her husband fought frequently, but she said that \\"he never hit me one time that I didn't hit him back twice.\\" Loretta has said that her marriage was \\"one of the hardest love stories.\\" In one of her autobiographies, she recalled: =Homes= Lynn owns a ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. Billed as \\"the Seventh Largest Attraction in Tennessee\\", it features a recording studio, museums, lodging, restaurants and western stores. Traditionally, three holiday concerts are hosted annually at the ranch, Memorial Day Weekend, Fourth of July Weekend, and Labor Day Weekend. Since 1982, the ranch has hosted Loretta Lynn's Amateur Championship motocross race, the largest amateur motocross race of its kind. The ranch also hosts GNCC Racing events. The centerpiece of the ranch is its large plantation home which Lynn once resided in with her husband and children. She hasn't lived in the antebellum mansion in more than 30 years. Lynn regularly greets fans who are touring the plantation house. Also featured on the property is a replica of the cabin in which Lynn grew up in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. In the mid-1970s, Lynn and her husband built a house in Teacap√°n, Mexico which they owned for a couple of decades. Lynn and her husband also bought a cabin in Canada. =Health problems= Over the years, Lynn has suffered from various health concerns, including pneumonia on multiple occasions, a broken arm after a fall at home. Lynn missed a tribute to her from other women of country in 2010 due to undergoing knee surgery. In May 2017, Lynn had a stroke at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. She was taken to a Nashville hospital and subsequently had to cancel all of her upcoming tour dates. The release of her new album Wouldn't It Be Great was delayed until 2018. According to her website, she is expected to make a full recovery. On January 1, 2018, Lynn fell and broke her hip. =Politics= At the height of her popularity, some of Lynn's songs were banned from radio airplay, including \\"Rated \\"X\\",\\" about the double standards divorced women face; \\"Wings Upon Your Horns,\\" about the loss of teenage virginity; and \\"The Pill,\\" with lyrics by T. D. Bayless, about a wife and mother becoming liberated by the birth-control pill. Her song \\"Dear Uncle Sam,\\" released in 1966, during the Vietnam War, describes a wife's anguish at the loss of a husband to war. It was included in live performances during the Iraq War. In 1971, Lynn was the first solo female country artist to perform at the White House, at the invitation of President Richard Nixon. She returned there to perform during the administrations of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Although Lynn has been outspoken about her views on controversial social and political subjects, she stated, \\"I don't like to talk about things where you're going to get one side or the other unhappy. My music has no politics.\\" In her autobiography, Lynn said her father was a Republican and her mother a Democrat. When asked about her position on same- sex marriage by USA Today in November 2010, she replied, \\"I'm still an old Bible girl.

The empire was formed by and under the command of Marshal Jean-B√©del Bokassa, military dictator and president of the Central African Republic, on 4 December 1976. Bokassa spent the equivalent of over , a third of the country's government annual income, on his coronation ceremony. The monarchy was abolished (the most recent one ruled by an emperor) and the republic was restored on 21 September 1979, when Bokassa was ousted and replaced with David Dacko, with French support.  History  = Proclamation = Imperial Standard of Bokassa I. In September 1976, Bokassa dissolved the government and replaced it with the Central African Revolutionary Council. On 4 December 1976, at the MESAN congress, Bokassa instituted a new constitution, converted back to Roman Catholicism‚Äîhe had briefly become a Muslim earlier in the year‚Äîand declared the republic to be a monarchy: the \\"Central African Empire\\". He had himself crowned and styled himself \\"His Imperial Majesty\\" on 4 December 1977. Bokassa's full title was \\"Emperor of Central Africa by the Will of the Central African People, United within the National Political Party, the MESAN\\". His regalia, lavish coronation ceremony, and r√©gime were largely inspired by Napol√©on I, who had converted the French First Republic, of which he was First Consul, into the First French Empire. The coronation ceremony was estimated to cost his country roughly ‚Äì one-third of the country's budget and all of France's aid for that year. Bokassa attempted to justify his actions by claiming that creating a monarchy would help Central Africa \\"stand out\\" from the rest of the continent, and earn the world's respect. Despite invitations, no foreign leaders attended the event. Many thought Bokassa was insane and compared his egotistical extravagance with that of Africa's other well-known eccentric dictator ‚Äì Field Marshal Idi Amin. It was claimed that the new empire would be a constitutional monarchy. However, in practice, Emperor Bokassa retained the dictatorial powers he had possessed as president, and MESAN remained the only legally permitted party. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the country was an absolute monarchy under a military dictatorship. Suppression of dissenters remained widespread, and torture was said to be especially rampant. It was subsequently proven at trial that Bokassa himself occasionally participated in beatings. = Overthrow = By January 1979, French support for Bokassa had eroded after riots in Bangui led to a massacre of civilians. Between 17 and 19 April, a number of high school students were arrested after they had protested against wearing the expensive, government- required school uniforms; an estimated 100 were killed. Emperor Bokassa personally participated in the massacre, where he was even reported beating some of the children to death with his own cane. The massive press coverage which followed the deaths of the students opened the way for a successful coup which saw French troops in Operation Barracuda restore former president David Dacko to power while Bokassa was away in Libya meeting with Gaddafi on 20 September 1979. Bokassa's overthrow by the French government was called \\"France's last colonial expedition\\" by veteran French diplomat Jacques Foccart. Fran√ßois Mitterrand refused to have France intervene in this manner again. Operation Barracuda began the night of 20 September and ended early the next morning. An undercover commando squad from the French intelligence agency SDECE, joined by the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment led by Colonel Brancion-Rouge, landed by Transall C-160, and managed to secure Bangui M'Poko International Airport. Upon arrival of two more transport aircraft, a message was sent to Colonel Degenne to come in with eight Puma helicopters and Transall aircraft, which took off from N'Djam√©na military airport in neighbouring Chad. By 12:30 p.m. on 21 September 1979, the pro-French Dacko proclaimed the fall of the Central African Empire. David Dacko remained president until he was overthrown on 1 September 1981 by General Andr√© Kolingba. Bokassa died on 3 November 1996 in the Central African Republic. In 2009, Jean-Serge Bokassa, who was seven years old when the Emperor was overthrown, stated his father's reign was \\"indefensible\\".  International response  = France's role = When Jean-B√©del Bokassa took control of the Central African Republic, the French president at the time, Charles de Gaulle, did not want to engage with the new leader, refusing to receive him and calling him a \\"bloody idiot\\" After heavy advising from his Chief of staff, Jacques Foccart, De Gaulle finally met Bokassa in 1969, three years after he came into power. After Charles De Gaulle died and Georges Pompidou exited office Valery Giscard took office in 1974. Giscard and Bokassa engaged correspondence and with Giscard's administration France and the Central African Empire become close allies. When Bokassa declared that he was going to be hosting a coronation for himself as the emperor of the new Central African Empire, many of novelties that attributed to the luxurious event came from France. This included an imperial crown as well as a golden throne in the shape of an eagle. After various allegations against Bokassa including the beating of school children as well as cannibalism France intervened with two operations that sought to remove Bokassa from office, the final one being Operation Barracuda. = President Valery Giscard = Valery Giscard became the president of France in May 1974, where his relationship with Bokassa was more interactive than previous administrations. During his first visit to the country in 1970 Bokassa presented him with diamonds and ivory carvings. Giscard advised Bokassa to avoid a ceremony to the scale of Napoleon due to the Central African Empire's financial situation and though Bokassa ignored Giscard's warning, Giscard was the first to congratulate Bokassa on the transition to Empire. Their relationship made news on 10 October 1979 when a newspaper named the Canard Enchaine broke a story about Bokassa giving thirty carats of diamonds to Giscard and accused him of giving Giscard a plethora of gifts on his visits to the empire. These included elephant tusks, ivory carved objects as well as precious stones estimated to be worth one million francs. This scandal was later called \\"diamondgate\\" or the Diamonds Affair scandal which later led to Giscard losing the presidency in the 1981 elections. = Operation Barracuda = Operation Barracuda was initiated in 1979 after the death of several school children after a protest that was shut down with many students imprisoned in Ngaraba. France severed ties with Bokassa, and began to plan his excommunication when the emperor began working with Muammar Gaddafi, a Libyan politician. Operation Barracuda entailed French soldiers entering the Central African Republic while Bokassa was on a trip to Libya and instating David Dacko, who had been exiled to Paris, as the new leader. France cut off all humanitarian aid for media presence and then later sent French troops into Bangui, the nation's capital, to install David Dacko as the new leader. Dacko stayed in a hotel in France, where he was exiled, awaiting the call to be transported into the nation as soon as Bokassa made himself unavailable. Leaders from Chad, The Congo (then Zaire) all agreed to the idea as well as to aid the French in transport and military support for Operation Barracuda. This operation's success effectively ended the Central African Empire and reintroduced the Central African Republic.

Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are online communities operating under social networking services. Howard Rheingold discussed virtual communities in his book, The Virtual Community, published in 1993. The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on The WELL, computer-mediated communication and social groups and information science. Technologies cited include Usenet, MUDs (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives MUSHes and MOOs, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), chat rooms and electronic mailing lists. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community. Virtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. Some virtual communities do both. Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: message boards, chat rooms, social networking World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds.Hof, R. D., Browder, S., Elstrom, P. (5 May 1997). Internet Communities. Business Week. Introduction The traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages, etc.). Virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition. Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members, then a virtual community is certainly a community.Pears, Iain. 1998. An Instance of the Fingerpost. London: Jonathan Cape. Virtual communities resemble real life communities in the sense that they both provide support, information, friendship and acceptance between strangers. Early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of reality, whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology. In the seventeenth century, scholars associated with the Royal Society of London formed a community through the exchange of letters. \\"Community without propinquity\\", coined by urban planner Melvin Webber in 1963 and \\"community liberated\\", analyzed by Barry Wellman in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community.Webber, Melvin. 1963. \\"Order in Diversity: Community without Propinquity.\\" Pp. 23‚Äì54 in Cities and Space: The Future Use of Urban Land, edited by J. Lowdon Wingo. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. Wellman, Barry. \\"The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers.\\" American Journal of Sociology 84 (March 1979): 1201‚Äì31. As well, Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities in 1983, described how different technologies, such as national newspapers, contributed to the development of national and regional consciousness among early nation- states.Anderson, Benedict. 1991. Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism. London: Verso. Some authors that built their theories on Anderson's Imagined communities have been critical of the concept, claiming that all communities are based on communication and that virtual/real dichotomy is disintegrating, making use of the word \\"virtual\\" problematic or even obsolete. Purpose A PLATO V terminal in 1981 displaying RankTrek application Virtual communities are used for a variety of social and professional groups; interaction between community members vary from personal to purely formal. For example, an email distribution list could serve as a personal means of communicating with family and friends, and also formally to coordinate with coworkers. = User Experience Testing to Determine Social Codes = User Experience is the ultimate goal for the program or software used by an internet community, because user experience will determine the software's success. The software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users‚Äô experience and designed specifically for online use. User experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system. When it comes to testing user experience in a software interface, three main characteristics are needed: a user who is engaged, a user who is interacting with a product or interface, and defining the users‚Äô experience in ways that are and observable or measurable. User experience metrics are based on a reliability and repeatability, using a consistent set of measurements to result in comparable outcomes. User experience metrics are based on user retention, using a consistent set of measurements to collect data on user experience. The widespread use of the Internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers. The vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience. Some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning, productivity, user satisfaction, how much people remember using the software, and how many errors they make. The human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community. The success of online communities depend on the integration of usability and social semiotics. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user's habits when interacting with a program. Social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns. People communicate their social identities or culture code through the work they do, the way they talk, the clothes they wear, their eating habits, domestic environments and possessions, and use of leisure time. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user's habits when interacting with a program.The information provided during a usability test can determine demographic factors and help define the semiotic social code. Dialogue and social interactions, support information design, navigation support, and accessibility are integral components specific to online communities. As virtual communities grow, so do the diversity of their users. However, the technologies are not made to be any more or less intuitive. Usability tests can ensure users are communicating effectively using social and semiotic codes while maintaining their social identities. Efficient communication requires a common set of signs in the minds of those seeking to communicate. As technologies evolve and mature, they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users. This kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology doesn't necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use. Usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities. Projek=/\\"off Effects =On health= Concerns with a virtual community's tendency to promote less socializing include: verbal aggression and inhibitions, promotion of suicide and issues with privacy. However, studies regarding the health effects of these communities did not show any negative effects. There was a high drop-out rate of participants in the study. The health-related effects are not clear because of the lack of thoroughness and the variation in studies done on the subject. Rather, recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues. These forms of social networks allow for open conversation between individuals who are going through similar experiences, whether themselves or in their family. Such sites have so grown in popularity that now many health care providers form groups for their patients by providing web areas where one may direct questions to doctors. These sites prove especially useful when related to rare medical conditions. People with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community, thus online communities act as primary means for such support. Online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease, as well as offer more practical support, such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease. Involvement in social communities of similar health interests has created a means for patients to develop a better understanding and behavior towards treatment and health practices. Patients increasingly use such outlets, but the extent to which these practices have effects on health are still being studied. Studies on health networks have mostly been conducted on groups which typically suffer the most from extreme forms of diseases, for example cancer patients, HIV patients, or patients with other life-threatening diseases. It is general knowledge that one participates in online communities to interact with society and develop relationships. Individuals who suffer from rare or severe illnesses are unable to meet physically because of distance or because it could be a risk to their health to leave a secure environment. Thus, they have turned to the internet. A study conducted by Haven B. Battles and Lori S. Wiener on the effects of networks on children suffering from incurable diseases reveal a positive correlation in enhancing children's behaviors and overall moods. Their behavior and mood not only changed, but they were more willing to go to treatment after having these interactions. In addition to communities which focus strictly on information relating to illness and disease, there are also those which focus on specific health-related conditions such as fertility issues. Some studies have indicated that virtual communities can provide valuable benefits to their users. Online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks. Growing amounts of presented material show how online communities affect the health of their users. Apparently the creation of health communities has a positive impact on those who are ill or in need of medical information. =On civic participation= New forms of civic engagement and citizenship have emerged from the rise of social networking sites. Networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities. Online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media, but also connect with large networked communities. Within these spaces, young people are pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of engagement such as voting and joining political organizations and creating their own ways to discuss, connect, and act in their communities. Civic engagement through online volunteering has shown to have positive effects on personal satisfaction and development. Some 84 percent of online volunteers found that their online volunteering experience had contributed to their personal development and learning.UNV Annual Report 2014, Innovation and Knowledge =On communication= In his book The Wealth of Networks from 2006, Yochai Benkler suggests that virtual communities would \\"come to represent a new form of human communal existence, providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction\\". Although Benkler's prediction has not become entirely true, clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community. The two main effects that can be seen according to Benkler are a \\"thickening of preexisting relations with friends, family and neighbours\\" and the beginnings of the \\"emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships\\". Despite being acknowledged as \\"loose\\" relationships, Benkler argues that they remain meaningful. Previous concerns about the effects of Internet use on community and family fell into two categories: 1) sustained, intimate human relations \\"are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need\\" and 2) people with \\"social capital\\" are better off than those who lack it. It leads to better results in terms of political participation. However, Benkler argues that unless Internet connections actually displace direct, unmediated, human contact, there is no basis to think that using the Internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically, or in the useful connections we make socially. Benkler continues to suggest that the nature of an individual changes over time, based on social practices and expectations. There is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded, unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships. Manuel Castells calls this the 'networked society'. = On Identity = In 1997, MCI Communications released the \\"Anthem\\" advertisement, heralding the internet as a utopia without age, race, or gender. Lisa Nakamura argues in chapter 16 of her 2002 book After/image of identity: Gender, Technology, and Identity Politics, that technology gives us iterations of our age, race and gender in virtual spaces, as opposed to them being fully extinguished. Nakamura uses a metaphor of \\"after-images\\" to describe the cultural phenomenon of expressing identity on the internet. The idea is that any performance of identity on the internet is simultaneously present and past-tense, \\"posthuman and projectionary\\", due to its immortality. Doctor Sherry Turkle, professor of Social Studies of Science and Technology at MIT, believes the internet is a place where actions of discrimination are less likely to occur. In her 1995 book Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet, she argues that discrimination is easier in reality as it is easier to identify as face value, what is contrary to your norm. The internet allows for a more fluid expression of identity and thus, we become more accepting of inconsistent personae within ourselves and others. For these reasons, Turkle argues users existing in online spaces are less compelled to judge or compare ourselves to our peers, allowing people in virtual settings an opportunity to gain a greater capacity for acknowledging diversity. Nakamura argues against this view, coining the term Identity Tourism in her 1999 article Race In/For Cyberspace: Identity Tourism and Racial Passing on the Internet. Identity tourism, in the context of cyberspace, is a term used to the describe the phenomenon of users donning and doffing other-race and other-gender personae. Nakamura finds that performed behavior from these identity tourists often perpetuate stereotypes.  Gender  The gaming community is extremely vast and accessible to a wide variety of people, However, there are negative effects on the relationships 'gamers' have with the medium when expressing identity of gender. Doctor Adrienne Shaw notes in her 2012 article Do you identify as a gamer? Gender, race, sexuality, and gamer identity, that gender, perhaps subconsciously, plays a large role in identifying oneself as a 'gamer.' Types = Internet-based = The explosive diffusion of the Internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities. Virtual communities may synthesize Web 2.0 technologies with the community, and therefore have been described as Community 2.0, although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like PLATO and later on Usenet. Online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online. This interaction emphasizes the reciprocity element of the unwritten social contract between community members. =Internet message boards= An Internet forum powered by phpBB An online message board is a forum where people can discuss thoughts or ideas on various topics or simply express an idea. Users may choose which thread, or board of discussion, they would like to read or contribute to. A user will start a discussion by making a post. Other users who choose to respond can follow the discussion by adding their own posts to that thread at any time. Unlike in spoken conversations, message boards do not usually have instantaneous responses; users actively go to the website to check for responses. Anyone can register to participate in an online message board. People can choose to participate in the virtual community, even if or when they choose not to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Unlike chat rooms, at least in practice, message boards can accommodate an almost infinite number of users. Internet users' urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers. Studies have shown that people are more likely to intervene when they are the only one in a situation. With Internet message boards, users at their computers are alone, which might contribute to their willingness to reach out. Another possible explanation is that people can withdraw from a situation much more easily online than off. They can simply click exit or log off, whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life. The lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people, because, if one chooses to keep it private, there is no associated label of gender, age, ethnicity or lifestyle. =Online chat rooms= An example of an IRC chat session on Xaric, a text-based client. Shown are two IRC channels and a private conversation. Shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums, people started to want a way of communicating with their \\"communities\\" in real time. The downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting, which, with people all around the world in different time frames, could take a while. The development of online chat rooms allowed people to talk to whoever was online at the same time they were. This way, messages were sent and online users could immediately respond. The original development by CompuServe CB hosted forty channels in which users could talk to one another in real time. The idea of forty different channels led to the idea of chat rooms that were specific to different topics. Users could choose to join an already existent chat room they found interesting, or start a new \\"room\\" if they found nothing to their liking. Real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games, where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text. Now, chat rooms can be found on all sorts of topics, so that people can talk with others who share similar interests. Chat rooms are now provided by Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and other individual websites such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL. Chat room users communicate through text-based messaging. Most chat room providers are similar and include an input box, a message window, and a participant list. The input box is where users can type their text-based message to be sent to the providing server. The server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room so that it can be displayed in the message window. The message window allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted. There is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room, so that people can see who is in their virtual community. Users can communicate as if they are speaking to one another in real life. This \\"simulated reality\\" attribute makes it easy for users to form a virtual community, because chat rooms allow users to get to know one another as if they were meeting in real life. The individual \\"room\\" feature also makes it more likely that the people within a chat room share a similar interest; an interest that allows them to bond with one another and be willing to form a friendship. =Virtual worlds= A party scene from Second Life in Hyrule Virtual worlds are the most interactive of all virtual community forms. In this type of virtual community, people are connected by living as an avatar in a computer-based world. Users create their own avatar character (from choosing the avatar's outfits to designing the avatar's house) and control their character's life and interactions with other characters in the 3-D virtual world. It is similar to a computer game, however there is no objective for the players. A virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm. Characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality. For example, characters can socialize with one another and hold intimate relationships online. This type of virtual community allows for people to not only hold conversations with others in real time, but also to engage and interact with others. The avatars that users create are like humans. Users can choose to make avatars like themselves, or take on an entirely different personality than them. When characters interact with other characters, they can get to know one another through text-based talking and virtual experience (such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world). A virtual community chat room may give real-time conversations, but people can only talk to one another. In a virtual world, characters can do activities together, just like friends could do in reality. Communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real-life communities because the characters are physically in the same place, even if the users who are operating the characters are not. It is close to reality, except that the characters are digital. Second Life is one of the most popular virtual worlds on the Internet. Whyville offers a good alternative for younger audiences where safety and privacy are a concern. In Whyville, you use the virtual world's simulation aspect to experiment and learn about various phenomena. Another use for virtual worlds has been in business communications. Benefits from virtual world technology such as photo realistic avatars and positional sound create an atmosphere for participants that provides a less fatiguing sense of presence. Enterprise controls that allow the meeting host to dictate the permissions of the attendees such as who can speak, or who can move about allow the host to control the meeting environment. Several companies are creating business based virtual worlds including Second Life. These business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants, desktop sharing, or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group. Business based virtual worlds also may provide various enterprise features such as Single Sign on with third party providers, or Content Encryption. =Social network services= Facebook on the Ad-tech 2010 Social networking services are the most prominent type of virtual community. They are either a website or software platform that focuses on creating and maintaining relationships. Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace are all virtual communities. With these sites, one often creates a profile or account, and adds friends or follow friends. This allows people to connect and look for support using the social networking service as a gathering place. These websites often allow for people to keep up to date with their friends and acquaintances' activities without making much of an effort. On Facebook, for example, one can upload photos and videos, chat, make friends, reconnect with old ones, and join groups or causes. All of these functions encourage people to form a community, large or small, on the Internet. =Specialized information communities= Participatory culture plays a large role in online and virtual communities. In participatory culture, users feel that their contributions are important and that by contributing, they are forming meaningful connections with other users. The differences between being a producer of content on the website and being a consumer on the website become blurred and overlap. According to Henry Jenkins, \\"Members believe their contributions matter and feel some degree of social connection with one another \\"(Jenkins, et al. 2005). The exchange and consumption of information requires a degree of \\"digital literacy\\", such that users are able to \\"archive, annotate, appropriate, transform and recirculate media content\\" (Jenkins). Specialized information communities centralizes a specific group of users who are all interested in the same topic. For example, TasteofHome.com, the website of the magazine Taste of Home, is a specialized information community that focuses on baking and cooking. The users contribute consumer information relating to their hobby and additionally participate in further specialized groups and forums. Specialized Information Communities are a place where people with similar interests can discuss and share their experiences and interests. Howard Rheingold's study Howard Rheingold's Virtual Community could be compared with Mark Granovetter's ground-breaking \\"strength of weak ties\\" article published twenty years earlier in the American Journal of Sociology. Rheingold translated, practiced and published Granovetter's conjectures about strong and weak ties in the online world. His comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society: \\"My seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer. Sometimes he talks to them, even if nobody else can see them. And she knows that these invisible friends sometimes show up in the flesh, materializing from the next block or the other side of the world.\\" (page 1). Indeed, in his revised version of Virtual Community, Rheingold goes so far to say that had he read Barry Wellman's work earlier, he would have called his book \\"online social networks\\". Rheingold's definition contains the terms \\"social aggregation and personal relationships\\" (pp3). Lipnack & Stamps (1997) and Mowshowitz (1997) point out how virtual communities can work across space, time and organizational boundaries; Lipnack & Stamps (1997) mention a common purpose; and Lee, Eom, Jung and Kim (2004) introduce \\"desocialization\\" which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings, e.g. an increase in virtual socialization. Calhoun (1991) presents a dystopia argument, asserting the impersonality of virtual networks. He argues that IT has a negative influence on offline interaction between individuals because virtual life takes over our lives. He believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts. (Wellman & Haythornthwaite, 2002). Recently, Mitch Parsell (2008) has suggested that virtual communities, particularly those that leverage Web 2.0 resources, can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization, increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases. Advantages of Internet communities Internet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community. This interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home, such as: shopping, paying bills, and searching for specific information. Users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as: politics, technical assistance, social activities, health (see above) and recreational pleasures. Virtual communities provide an ideal medium for these types of relationships because information can easily be posted and response times can be very fast. Another benefit is that these types of communities can give users a feeling of membership and belonging. Users can give and receive support, and it is simple and cheap to use. Economically, virtual communities can be commercially successful, making money through membership fees, subscriptions, usage fees, and advertising commission. Consumers generally feel very comfortable making transactions online provided that the seller has a good reputation throughout the community. Virtual communities also provide the advantage of disintermediation in commercial transactions, which eliminates vendors and connects buyers directly to suppliers. Disintermediation eliminates pricey mark-ups and allows for a more direct line of contact between the consumer and the manufacturer. Disadvantages of Internet communities While instant communication means fast access, it also means that information is posted without being reviewed for correctness. It is difficult to choose reliable sources because there is no editor who reviews each post and makes sure it is up to a certain degree of quality. In theory, online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of Second Life's use of avatars. Some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online identity theft or online predators.
