History The hotel was created by Carlo \\"Carlino\\" Cinque (1911‚Äì1984).Berger. Page 167. Cinque had been in the hospitality business since 1934 when just 21 years old he rented a house in Positano to tourists with the hope of turning it into a hotel.Fisher, Page 132. This business he developed into the Albergo Miramare. Positano at the time was still just a small fishing village that was gradually starting to attract the attention of tourists. As the Miramare became established as one of the most popular hotels on the Amalfi Coast Cinque took to rowing his small fishing boat in the late afternoon to a headland two km south of Positano in the Laurito district that everybody knew as La Punta (The Point), where he dropped his lobster pots. It had a little beach, lush vegetation and the cliff here seemed to fall vertically from sky to sea. At the top was a small, white walled fisherman's chapel called San Pietro. Cinque fell in love with it and eventually resolved to buy the land from his brother in law, which he accomplished in 1962. Overcoming the obstacles created by the logistical difficulties of elevation and excavation, Cinque eventually completed a small apartment and garden. Additional rooms and terraces were added. Little by little, the idea of transforming the craggy precipice into a hotel was born. He began cutting into the rock without disturbing the natural beauty of the surroundings. Cinque would often take his boat out into the bay to determine how he needed to sculpture the cliff. Cinque undertook the roles of architect, construction engineer, site supervisor, and interior designer. The only advice he took was from an electrical engineer. Perhaps the most difficult aspect was the blasting that took place to install an elevator from the main lobby 88 metres (288 ft) down to connects to 22 m (75 ft) long horizontal tunnel out to a seaside sunbathing platform and bar. Finally after eight years of dynamiting and cutting the cliff apart he spent another three years constructing the buildings before opening the hotel on 29 June 1970 with 33 rooms.Stern. Page 381. As Cinque wanted the interior to have minimal separation from the outside plants and flowers he drilled through walls, ceilings and floors and threaded vines and creepers through the openings, training them to grow from the outside. As time went on he added more rooms and more gardens on nearly a dozen levels. There are those that face the sea while others provide views of Positano and the little village of Praiano several kilometres to the south.

In 1989, the hotel joined the Relais et Chateaux hotel group. In 2002 the Zass restaurant (which was previously just called the \\"Restaurant at Il San Pietro\\") received a Michelin star.

It is a \\"game\\" reportedly consisting of a series of tasks assigned to players by administrators over a 50-day period, initially innocuous before introducing elements of self-harm and the final challenge requiring the player to commit suicide. \\"Blue Whale\\" first attracted news coverage in May 2016 in an article in Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta that linked many unrelated child suicides to membership of group \\"F57\\" on the Russian-based VK social network. A wave of moral panic swept Russia. However, the piece was later criticised for attempting to make a causal link where none existed, and none of the suicides were found to be a result of the group activities. Claims of suicides connected to the game have been reported worldwide, but none have been confirmed. Background In November 2015, a Russian teenager posted a selfie with the caption \\"nya bye\\" before committing suicide; her death was then discussed in internet forums and groups, becoming mixed with scare stories and folklore. Further suicides were added to the group stories. Soon after, Russian journalist Galina Mursaliyeva first wrote about these \\"death groups\\" in an article published in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta in April 2016. The article described the \\"F57\\" groups on Russian social media site VK, that she claimed had incited 130 teenagers to commit suicide. Mursaliyeva's article was criticised at the time of its release for lacking credible data and balance, with the 130 cases of suicide cited being particularly problematic. The number was originally suggested by the father of one of the suicides, Sergey Pestov, who came to the figure 130 by using Russian media sources to look for child suicides he believed to be linked to online groups and then produced a brochure which implied that foreign intelligence operatives were responsible for encouraging Russian children to commit suicide. After an investigation by Evgeny Berg for Meduza, Mursaliyeva responded by saying in fact there had been at least 200. The origin of the name \\"Blue Whale\\" is uncertain. Some reports say that it comes from a song by the Russian rock band Lumen. Its opening lines are \\"Why scream / When no one hears / What we're talking about?\\" and it features a \\"huge blue whale\\" that \\"can't break through the net.\\" Others believe it to be a reference to beaching, where whales become stranded on beaches and die. The game is said to run on different social media platforms and is described as a relationship between an administrator and participant. Over a period of fifty days the administrator sets one task per day; the tasks seem innocuous to begin with (\\"get up at 4:30 am\\", \\"watch a horror movie\\"), and move on to self-harm, leading to the participant committing suicide on the final day. As professor at Russian State University for the Humanities, Alexandra Arkhipova found that the administrators were found to be children aged between 12 and 14, drawn to the story as it became widely reported and not, as the hysteria had intimated, predatory adults. Social concerns While many experts suggest \\"Blue Whale\\" was originally a sensationalised hoax, they believe that it is likely that the phenomenon has led to instances of imitative self-harming and copycat groups, leaving vulnerable children at risk of cyberbullying and online shaming. By late 2017, reported participation in Blue Whale was receding; however, internet safety organisations across the world have reacted by giving general advice to parents and educators on suicide prevention, mental health awareness, and online safety in advance of the next incarnation of cyberbullying. American skeptic Ben Radford researched the phenomenon, calling it the \\"moral panic du jour\\" and equating it to the Dungeons & Dragons controversies of the 1980s. Radford also states \\"this is only the latest in a long series of similar moral panics and outrages shared on social media... the best antidote ... is a healthy dose of skepticism\\". Arrests In 2016, Philipp Budeikin, a 21-year- old former psychology student who was expelled from his university, claimed that he invented the game in 2013. He said his intention was to cleanse society by pushing persons to suicide whom he deemed as having no value. Although originally claiming innocence and stating he was \\"just having fun\\", Budeikin was arrested and held in Kresty Prison, Saint Petersburg, and in May 2016 pled guilty to \\"inciting at least 16 teenage girls to commit suicide\\". He was later convicted on two counts of inciting suicide of a minor. Commentators such as Benjamin Radford have pointed out that sensationalized stories in world news regarding the involvement of Budeikin have all linked back to just two Russian sources, with tabloid news outlets replicating the same information without elaboration. In June 2017, postman Ilya Sidorov was arrested in Moscow, also accused of setting up a \\"Blue Whale\\" group to encourage children to self-harm and ultimately commit suicide. He claimed to have persuaded 32 children to join his group and follow commands. In June 2018, Russian financial analyst Nikita Nearonov was arrested for allegedly masterminding the Blue Whale game. Nearonov is suspected of grooming 10 \\"underage\\" girls in order to bring them to suicide, 2 of which, aged 14 and 17, are known to have survived. As a financial analyst, Nearonov has been described as a \\"very smart\\" computer expert who held a large amount of contempt for teenagers, believing that they were \\"wicked\\" and \\"deserved to die\\". Police reports claim that Nearonov's involvement in the Blue Whale game was his \\"hobby\\". Alleged incidents =Bangladesh= Despite many news reports published in Bangladeshi media attempting to link suicides with the game, no case has been officially confirmed. In October 2017, Bangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan stated that the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission has been directed to investigate the Blue Whale game after reports of suicide around the country. BTRC released a notice urging people to call a specific number if any web link or any information related to the Blue Whale game were to be found. Later that month, the Bangladeshi High Court ordered a six-month ban on special night-time internet packages provided by various mobile operators across the country in order to curb suicides resulting from the game. =Brazil= Despite several news reports in Brazilian media linking cases of child self-harm and suicide with Blue Whale and several ongoing investigations, none has been officially confirmed. In response to the game, a designer and a publicity agent from S√£o Paulo created a movement called Baleia Rosa (Pink Whale), which became popular. It relied on the collaboration of hundreds of volunteers. The movement is based on positive tasks that value life and combat depression. Also in Brazil, Sandro Sanfelice created the movement Capivara Amarela (Yellow Capybara), which proposes to \\"combat the Blue Whale game\\" and guide people seeking some kind of help. Participants are separated between challengers, who are the people who seek help, and the healers, who are kind of godfathers of these people. An Adventist school in southern Paran√°, in partnership with other education networks, also sought to reverse the situation by proposing another charity game, the \\"Jonas Challenge\\" (referring to the biblical character Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale and vomited up three days later). Other games created in Brazil in response to the Blue Whale were the Baleia Verde (Green Whale) and the Pregui√ßa Azul (Blue Sloth). In Belo Horizonte and Recife metropolitan area in Brazil, many schools promoted lectures to talk about the Blue Whale game. On May 21, 2017, it was announced that the Brazilian police Specialized in High Technology Crime Repression in Piau√≠ were preparing a digital primer to warn young people about the dangers of the game. =China= In May 2017, Tencent, China's largest Internet service portal, closed 12 suspicious Blue Whale-related network groups on its social networking platform QQ. It said that the number of this kind of groups is on the rise.\\"Tencent closes suspicious network groups on Russian ‚ÄòBlue Whale‚Äô suicide game . People's Daily Online. The search results of related keywords was also blocked in QQ. = Egypt = In April 2018, Egyptian news sources claimed a 12-year-old schoolboy had committed suicide by taking poisonous tablets to fulfill one of the challenges of the game. According to the media, the schoolboy was found with a scar in the shape of a blue whale on his right arm. In reaction to the growing media awareness of the game, Egypt's Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah uploaded a video on their YouTube channel claiming that the game is forbidden in Islam, and warning against it. =India= Throughout 2017, media in India reported several cases of child suicide, self-harm and attempted suicide alleged to be a result of Blue Whale, and in response, the Indian government's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, requested that several internet companies (including Google, Facebook, and Yahoo!) remove all links which direct users to the game. Some commentators accused the government of creating a moral panic. Indian internet watchdog the Centre for Internet and Society accused the coverage of effectively spreading and advertising a \\"game\\" for which there is little evidence. In India, suicide was the second most common form of death of children, according to a 2012 report. The Supreme Court asked the Indian Central government to ban the game, following which the government responded that since Blue Whale wasn't an application, it couldn't be banned. Finally in January 2018, after a full investigation the government reported there was no evidence that any death was as a result of Blue Whale saying ‚ÄúThe committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents. Involvement of Blue Whale challenge game in any of these incidents could not be established.‚Äù =Iran= In September 2017, the Iranian Minister of Information and Communications Technology posted a message in his official Instagram account to warn parents and teachers about the spread of the Blue Whale challenge among Iranian teens. =Italy= In Italy, press coverage of \\"Blue Whale\\" first appeared on 3 June 2016, in the newspaper La Stampa, which described the challenge as \\"a bad joke\\". The debunking site BUTAC reported the total lack of evidence to affirm the game's existence. On 14 May 2017, a TV report by Le Iene about 'Blue Whale' on the national channel Italia 1 linked the challenge to an unconnected suicide in Livorno. The report showed several suicide scenes, mostly from videos on LiveLeak depicting adults unrelated to the challenge. It incorrectly described the footage as evidence of teenagers playing the game. The report interviewed a schoolmate of the Livorno teenager, two mothers of Russian girls who supposedly took part in the game, and the founder of the Russian Center for the safety of children from internet crimes. Following the report, coverage of the challenge in the Italian media increased, with many outlets describing it as real. There was a sharp rise in Google searches for the challenge, and some panic. On 15 and 16 May, newspapers announced the arrest of Budeikin, without saying that it happened months before. His unconfirmed statements about his supposed victims being \\"genetical rubbish\\" were reported as real. Paolo Attivissimo, a journalist and debunker of hoaxes, described the game as \\"a death myth dangerously exaggerated by sensationalist journalism\\". Police received calls from terrified parents and teachers, and there were reports of teenagers taking part in the challenge. These included several cases of self-mutilation and attempted suicide. Most reports were considered to be false or exaggerated. Alleged participants were reported from all over Italy: Ravenna, Brescia and Siracusa. On May 22, 2017, the Polizia Postale declared that they had received 40 alarms. On the 24th this number was increased to 70. On its website the Polizia Postale defines Blue Whale as \\"a practice that seems to possibly come from Russia\\" and offers advice to parents and teenagers. Several alleged cases have since been described by newspapers. =Israel= In July of 2020, the Israeli Child Online Protection Bureau had announced they are collaborating with TikTok to \\"eradicate the Blue Whale phenomenon\\".https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/tiktok_wont_allow_blue_whale_profiles_130720 =Russia= In March 2017, authorities in Russia were investigating approximately 130 separate cases of suicide related to the phenomenon. In February a 15-year-old and 16-year-old threw themselves off the top of a 14-story building in Irkutsk, Siberia after completing 50 tasks sent to them. Before they killed themselves together, they left messages on their pages on social networks. Also in February, a 15-year-old was in critical condition after throwing herself out of an apartment and falling on snow-covered ground in the town of Krasnoyarsk, also in Siberia. On 26 May 2017, the Russian Duma passed a bill introducing criminal responsibility for creating pro-suicide groups on social media and in June 2017, President Putin signed a law imposing criminal penalties for inducing minors to suicide.

Orion was constructed as a whale catcher in 1904, in Christiana, Norway. She was a steam-powered vessel, long, wide, displacing 109 tonnes. Robert Lloyd Webb, author of a book on commercial whaling in the Pacific Northwest, wrote that she was the first steam-powered chaser boat in British Columbia. He recorded that Orion had to ship her whale catching gear in a commercial freighter, because every available space had to be loaded with coal for her long and difficult voyage from Norway, around Cape Horn, to British Columbia. Orions first crew, who sailed her from Norway, were Norwegian whalers. Her owners wanted to take advantage of the Norwegian whalers' experience, and invited them to stay in Canada. Canadian fishermen complained that their experience should be ignored, and Canadian seamen should be given first crack at their jobs. In its initial years of operation her owners considered Orion a great success, harvesting hundreds of whales per year. By 1916, nine other Canadian whalers were working out of British Columbia, and Americans had followed the Canadian example, and the whale stock off the coast of the Pacific Northwest had been devastated. Orion, like most of the other vessels, was repurposed. She was converted to fish halibut. In 1930 she was converted to serve as a fireboat, serving in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Port of Vancouver's 1933 annual report stated that Orion had responded to 75 alarms. Lea Edgar, a historian at the Vancouver Maritime Museum, wrote in the BC Shipping News, that Orion was \\"dubious in its effectiveness\\", and that she was retired, in 1937, and sold for scrap in 1941.

The title refers to Cappon's decision to resign from a leadership position in the conference after announcing his that he would be a New Democratic Party candidate in the next federal election. His position was that the conference was non-partisan and that he needed to resign to ensure it would not be mistaken for a party political affair. Quebec New Democratic Party president At one time a member of the Liberal Party,Susan Semenak, \\"Quebec NDP Gears Up,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 May 1988, B1. Cappon ran for the House of Commons of Canada under the banner of the New Democratic Party (NDP) in the 1988 federal election, ultimately finishing third in Laval. At one stage in this campaign, seven NDP candidates in Quebec issued a policy statement that was not authorized by the party leadership, attacking official bilingualism and calling for the provincial government to have sole jurisdiction over the protection and promotion of the French language in Quebec. Cappon opposed this statement, saying that it could turn Anglophone Quebecers into second-class citizens.Irwin Block, \\"No limit on anglophone rights implied: NDP candidates,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 November 1988, A1. Cappon was elected as president of the federal branch of New Democratic Party in Quebec on April 30, 1989, the date on which the provincial branch of the Quebec NDP became autonomous from the federal party. Cappon approved of the separation of the two parties, noting that would permit Quebecers to affiliate with the federal party without automatically joining the more nationalist provincial group.Peter Kuitenbrouwer, \\"Quebec NDP splits from federal party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 May 1989, A1. The federal NDP formally granted autonomy to the Quebec provincial party in December 1989, a development that Cappon said would save the federal party's standing in the province. See \\"Quebec NDP given autonomy,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 December 1989, A8.

In early 1990, NDP candidate Phil Edmonston won a federal by-election in Chambly to become the NDP's first elected member from the province of Quebec. During the campaign, Edmonston criticized his own party's position on the Meech Lake Accord on constitutional change; the NDP had called for amendments to the accord, while Edmonston favoured retention of the original language in its entirety. Cappon was critical of Edmonston's position, arguing that he should not be permitted to campaign against party policy.Ian Austen, \\"Stick to NDP line or quit, Edmonston told,\\" Montreal Gazette, 14 December 1989, B6. Edmonston and Cappon subsequently emerged as bitter rivals, and Cappon ultimately resigned as president in June 1990 after Edmonston's supporters pushed through a vote of non-confidence in his leadership at a quarterly meeting of the Quebec party's federal council.Lewis Harris, \\"NDP's Quebec wing censures president,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 May 1990, A3; Irwin Block, \\"Cappon resigns as Quebec president of federal NDP,\\" Montreal Gazette, 11 June 1990, A5.

In December 2006, Cappon called for a national strategy and better quality control in relation to post-secondary education, warning that other countries were far exceeding Canada in developing targets for funding, graduation rates, class size, and other matters. In a line that he would repeat several times in the following years, he warned that other jurisdictions would \\"eat [Canada's] lunch\\" in various areas of achievement if the country did not develop an effective national strategy.Louise Brown, \\"Boom lowered on higher ed,\\" Toronto Star, 8 December 2006.

The ultra-high point of the range is the high peak of Mashanig which lies at approximately above sea level. Other peaks of local prominence include Girhimitin, Hazrat Muqadriyoun and Herem Hajhir. Etymology The name \\"Hajhir\\" (Soqotri: ), sometimes transliterated as \\"Hagghier\\" or \\"Hagher\\" in English,Aemnp likely derives from the Arabic \\"·∏•ijr\\" (, meaning \\"stone\\"). Other possible origins of the range's name include the word \\"hajar\\" (, meaning \\"to flee\\"). The name \\"Mashanig\\" (Soqotri: , meaning \\"the split one\\"), likely derives from the Arabic verb \\"inshaq\\" (, meaning \\"to split\\"), from which one gets the word \\"munshuq\\" (, meaning \\"splittist\\"). Climbing history Bedouin goatherds have a long history of climbing in the Hajhir. A 2014 study of Soqotri oral storytelling traditions revealed that a number of popular myths recount ascents throughout the range by local goatherds. According to the anthropologist Christopher Elliott, many accounts demonstrate a strong oral chain of transmission that links mythical characters with actual pre-modern ascents.

After the section collapsed, I-85 was closed to traffic for approximately between its split with I-75 and the interchange with State Route 400 (SR 400). Three sections of northbound I-85 and three sections of southbound I-85 were replaced in 43 days at a cost of $15 million USD. Three individuals were arrested in connection with the fire, although the charges were later dropped. A NTSB report determined that the Georgia Department of Transportation contributed to the incident by unsafely storing materials under the bridge.  Events  On March 30, 2017, a massive fire collapsed a section of the I-85 freeway viaduct in Atlanta, Georgia, stranding motorists for miles during rush hour traffic. The fire under the viaduct was allegedly \\"maliciously set\\" by a group of three individuals. The area of the collapse was along SR 237 (Piedmont Road) in the Piedmont Heights neighborhood north of Midtown Atlanta. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed described the situation as a \\"transportation crisis\\" and Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency. The fire started at approximately 6:05 p.m. in a state-owned storage area under the highway bridge which contained high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and fiberglass tubing. The heat from the fire caused the collapse of a section of I-85 northbound at 7:14 p.m. Fire crews had the blaze under control by about 8:00 p.m.  Aftermath  The highway was closed for an extended period of time in the area. No injuries were reported in the incident, and officials were credited with preventing casualties by stopping traffic and turning away onlookers. Terrorism or foul play was not immediately suspected. It was thought that other sections of the bridge may have been compromised from the heat of the fire. Inspections of the bridge prior to the fire reveal that the deck and superstructure were in good condition. Traffic data shows that both directions of a nearby point in the highway carried nearly a quarter million vehicles a day in 2015. The closure of the highway put extra strain on surface roads and nearby highways until it was reopened. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) announced an extension of service in response to the incident. MARTA general manager Keith Parker reported ridership spiked by 25% the day following the collapse. Three sections of the southbound side of the bridge, which did not collapse, also had to be replaced. The incident had a devastating effect on many area businesses, one of which reported a 90% decrease in traffic, seeing only three to four customers for the remainder of the day of the fire and the day following. Two weeks after the bridge collapse, President Donald Trump met with the first responders from the incident, commending them for preventing casualties following the bridge collapse. Trump agreed to send $10 million to the state of Georgia to assist in repairs and cleanup efforts. = Arrests and prosecutions = On March 31, officials arrested and charged three individuals in connection with the incident. Basil Eleby was charged with criminal trespassing and first-degree criminal damage to property for setting the fire, and two others were charged with criminal trespassing for being present when the fire was set. All three were believed to be homeless, though it was unclear whether they lived underneath the highway. The three were interrogated and taken to Fulton County jail, with the possibility of additional or upgraded charges as more evidence was developed. The charges against Eleby were later upgraded to first-degree arson, with his bail set at $200,000. An arrest affidavit indicated the three suspects went under the bridge to smoke crack. Eleby denied setting the fire, but one of the other suspects arrested said he watched Eleby put a chair on top of a shopping cart near some fiber optic wire, stored in PVC pipes under the bridge, and set the chair on fire. Eleby appeared in court on August 14, 2017. = Repairs and detours = GDOT officials announced on April 4, 2017, that repairs could be completed by mid- June 2017. Traffic was diverted to I-285, I-75 and SR 400. In an effort to speed completion, up to $3 million in incentive payments were authorized for the contractor, C.W. Matthews Contracting Company, which completed work by May 12, when the northbound lanes of the bridge reopened. In August 2017, a fence was built around the underpass near where the bridge collapsed.

Concerned that, under interrogation, she had inadvertently implicated a fellow activist, she died by hanging herself, using a radiator, in her prison cell.  Life  Frieda Schrinner was born into a working-class family. At the time of her birth her father was working on the manufacture of horse-trams. She grew up in an artisanal quarter of south-east Berlin, in what is today the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district. She attended school locally and then trained for work in the garments industry. Relatively little is known of her early years, but she continued to work in a garment factory till 1919, by which time she had in 1916 married and had a child with Richard Rosenthal, a clerical worker from whom she was later divorced. After the war she worked as an (at this stage unqualified) nurse-carer, taking a job locally in Berlin's Lichtenberg quarter.Hans Werner Sandvo√ü: Widerstand in Friedrichshain und Lichtenberg, 1933‚Äì1945. Gedenkst√§tte Deutscher Widerstand, 1998, p. 131f It was an unconventional career decision at a time when nursing was seen as a middle-class preserve. Only in 1930 would she finally complete the exams necessary to become a qualified nurse. In 1919 Frieda Rosenthal joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). The USPD had emerged a couple of years earlier in the context of a split of the mainstream Social Democratic Party, following ever more acute tensions arising, primarily, over the party leadership decision back in 1914 to implement what amounted to a parliamentary truce over funding for the war. In 1920 she was elected to the party's Lichtenberg district committee (\\"Bezirksversammlung\\"). As the USPD itself split apart, later in 1920 Rosenthal was part of the left wing majority that now joined the newly formed Communist Party (\\"Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands\\" / KPD). She appears never to have abandoned her nursing completely, employed by the welfare department in Berlin-Lichtenberg and from the mid 1920s working in Berlin's main health counselling office. Any more detailed official records concerning her employment during this period were destroyed in the Second World War. In any case, during the 1920s political work became the priority. In 1924 she was elected a member of the party leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for Berlin-Brandenburg. Her specific responsibilities lay on the areas of agitation and propaganda (in the portmaneau word of the time, \\"Agitprop\\") and, later, women's training and education. The same year she was elected to the Berlin city council (\\"Stadtverordnetenversammlung\\"), representing \\"Electoral District 14\\" (Berlin-Lichtenberg). During the next few years her party affiliations changed, but she continued to be elected to the Berlin city council without interruption until 1933. During her time in the city council she could be outspoken. She was involved in an advertisement that insulted President Hindenburg, still widely revered by many as one of the most successful military leaders during the First World War. Citing his wartime exploits she identified him as a mass murderer. Her outspokenness resonated with the party leadership, especially after 1924 when the left-wing took control. In 1927 she was on the receiving end of a court action issued on behalf of the president. She defended her position in the following terms: \\"It was unthinkable for me to meet the individual who is the current state president. In my position as a local representative I believe I am entitled to voice criticism in respect of the pre-revolutionary period. I simply wanted to make an observation concerning another time.\\"\\"Mir lag es fern, die Person des jetzigen Reichspr√§sidenten zu treffen. In meiner Eigenschaft als Bezirksverordnete nehme ich f√ºr mich das Recht in Anspruch, Kritik an der vorrevolution√§ren Zeit anzustellen. Ich habe lediglich eine Zeitbetrachtung anstellen wollen.\\" Nevertheless, despite being happy to \\"name the guilty men\\" her greater concern was with the clouds of social deprivation which had never really lifted in the years of acute economic hardship that had followed the war, and in that sense her practical approach was never entirely aligned with the more theoretical and doctrinaire concerns that underpinned the party leadership. During the internal party ructions that followed the death of Lenin, she backed the opposition line of the ultra-left at the time of the so- called \\"Open letter\\" in September 1925, but by November 1925 had already swung behind the party majority. One issue that attracted her passionate intervention involved the fierce discussions which took place in the city council during 1926 over the financing of the \\"Berliner Jugendland\\" children's holiday home which had opened the previous year. Using previously military buildings, the institution provided six week long holidays for Berlin children who had lost their fathers in the war. As an advocate for \\"hands-on\\" communist policies, Rosenthal demanded proper funding for the establishment, and mocked suggestions that fatherless children should be sent instead to the countryside for their summer holidays in order that they could be used as cheap labour on the farms and great landed estates of East Prussia: \\"[whereas] if we have the possibility to send thousands of Berlins school children for a few weeks during the summer to be accommodated with their class-mates, that is a [real] step forwards ... \\".\\"Denn wenn wir die M√∂glichkeit haben, von Berlin aus Tausende von Schulkindern einige Wochen im Sommer gemeinsam mit ihrer Klasse unterzubringen, dann ist das ein Fortschritt ... \\" In 1929, representing the Communist Party, she took a full-time job as a councillor in central Berlin. However, the party conflicts and accompanying purges in Moscow, reflecting Stalin's conviction - not entirely incorrect - that he might be surrounded by political rivals, found powerful echoes in the German sister party. In February 1930 Frieda Rosenthal was one of the signatories of the \\"Letter of the 60\\", organised by Erich Raddatz (and others). The letter criticised the direction being taken by the Soviet party leadership under Stalin. However, the party leaderships in the two countries were at this time closely aligned, and after signing the declaration Rosenthal was excluded from the party by the leadership in Berlin. Directly following this she is listed, among the members of the city council, as being \\"partyless\\". Along with others similarly excluded ex-communists, she belonged for some months to the so-called \\"Group 60\\". In or before 1931 she joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). During her final months as a member of the Communist Party she had switched from representing the Lichtenberg electoral district (District 14) in the city council to representing the Kreuzberg electoral district (District 6), and it was the Kreuzberg district that she continued to represent, as an SPD party member, till 1933. The political class was not blind to the threat of post-democratic populism represented by the Nazi Party, and as early as 1930 the SPD attempted to block a Nazi take-over by entering into some degree of political truce with the democratic parties of the political centre both in the national parliament (Reichstag) and regionally, in the Prussian Landtag and in the Berlin city council. The strategy was not a great success, and it appalled many on the left-wing of the SPD who responded by setting up a break-away Socialist Workers' Party (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\\" / SAP), hoping to forge a strategic political alliance not with the political centre but with the Communists. A particularly high-profile (at least in retrospect) deserter to the SAP was Willy Brandt. Frieda Rosenthal had also switched to the SAP by the end of 1932 according to at least one source, although other sources imply that her move may have come a couple of months later. In any event, the SAP met with little electoral success. The change of government in January 1933 indicated that attempts to thwart the populists had failed. The new government lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire in February 1933 was instantly (and apparently ahead of any investigation) blamed on \\"Communists\\", and those identified as having any sort of political past involving communism found themselves at the top of the government's target list. However, all political parties (apart from the Nazi party) had been outlawed by the end of June 1933. Frieda Rosenthal lost her job as a nurse and, after a brief period of unemployment, returned to work in the garment industry. Earlier political differences between comrades were forgotten and she joined an underground communist resistance group in Berlin's Friedrichshain quarter. The known illegal political activity in which they engaged included procuring information and distributing leaflets. Identified by the cover name K√§the, Frieda Rosenthal was in charge of \\"information\\" for the local group. In the immediate term, however, she remained at liberty and was able to continue working. By the summer of 1936 many local resistance groups, including the one in Friedrichshain, had been thoroughly penetrated by the intelligence services. Frieda Rosenthal was arrested on 19 August 1936 on suspicion of \\"preparing high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\") which was the usual charge under these circumstances. She was immediately taken to the detention centre in Berlin-Moabit and placed in rigidly enforced solitary confinement, unable to communicate with the outside world even in writing. She was subjected to repetitive and brutal interrogation, but refused to disclose the names of any of the comrades with whom she had been involved in her resistance work. There came a time, however, when she thought she had inadvertently identified one of them during an interrogation session. She was able to write immediately to the investigating judge with responsibility for the case that she believed she had falsely identified someone as a result of her own failing memory, but she became concerned that this \\"written recantation\\" would be ignored or overlooked. The situation led her to take her own life later on the same day. She hanged herself on 15 October 1936 using the radiator in her cell.  Celebration  Among the more recent celebrations of the life of Frieda Rosenthal is a Stolperstein, set into the road space outside her former home at Fanninger Street 53 (\\"Fanningerstra√üe 53\\") in the on 1 October 2008. This resulted from an initiative by the Berlin politician, Birgit Monteiro. Since 2010 a street in a new residential development in Berlin-Karlshorst has carried her name. Inaugurated in 2009 the Frieda Rosenthal prize is awarded annually to recognise and honour people from Berlin-Lichtenberg who have made an outstanding contribution, notably in the social and welfare spheres. Any resident of Lichtenberg can nominate a potential recipient.

The temple is a Pallava period structure, and was patronized by subsequent rulers. Description The Singavaram Ranganatha temple is located about 4 miles from the Gingee Fort, with the Queen's Fort linked by tunnels to this temple.Alf Hiltebeitel, (2009). Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics: Draupadi among Rajputs, Muslims, and Dalits, p.366. University of Chicago Press. The 24 feet long idol of Ranganatha, carved from living rock, is in a reclining pose on the coils of the serpent Ananta. A panel in the rear wall depicts the Gandharvas and Brahma, in which Brahma is born from the navel of Vishnu. Besides Garuda, the demons Madhu and Kaitabha who were killed by Vishnu are depicted. Goddess Bhoomidevi graces the feet of the lord while Prahlada sits near his knee. Pallava cave temples, cut from rock, dating to the time of Mahendravarman or Narisimhavarman (580-688 AD), exist in Melacceri as Maddileshvara temple and at Singavaram as Ranganatha temple. As per the Mandagapattu inscription, the Pallava king, Mahendravarman I established the tradition of the Ranganatha temple. Historian KR Srinivasan suggests Durga and Vishnu of this shrine are similar to some cave shrines of Mahabalipuram; and suggests the name \\"Singavaram\\" might be derived from another Pallava king, Mamalla who was either Narasimha or Simhavishnu. KR Srinivasan also notes the Dwarapalas in this temple follow Pallava iconography. Durga with 4 hands holding the Shankha, Chakra, and two arms resting on her thigh and waist, stands on the head of Mahishasura. Legend The Sthalapurana of the temple associates it with the legend of Prahlada, born to the demon-king Hiranyakashipu. An inscription of k≈çpperu√±jinga (a Kadava chieftain) in the Singavaram temple mentions the deity is tiruppanrikkunru emperuman possibly meaning a shrine intended for Varaha Perumal.Venkataramaiah, K.M.,(1996). A handbook of Tamil Nadu, p.39. International School of Dravidian Linguistics In a later legend, Tubbaki Krishnappa Nayak kept a flower garden dedicated to Lord Varadaraja Perumal. But Perumal in the form of a boar (Varaha) destroys the garden. Krishnappa chases the animal but could not kill it. The boar goes to Singavaram, bores himself into a cave, then reveals his propria persona to the nayak. Bewildered, the nayak invokes the blessings of the Singavaram god; who then directs him to build a temple with the help of an ascetic. The ascetic attempts to kill the nayak, but the nayak kills the ascetic instead and his dead body becomes gold, using which the temple of Ranganatha inside the Gingee fort was built, and the Singavaram temple was built (refurbished). The Shashti Poorthi celebration in this temple is associated with a legend of Desing Raja. This temple was his tutelary deity (Kuldev).Note: While Rajputs have Kuldevi goddesses and worship their Satimatas as family protectors, Vaishnava avatars like Ram and Krishna are part of their pantheon. As per local ballads on the legend, Raja Desingh sought the God's blessings before his battle against Sadatullah Khan, the Arcot Nawab, in 1714 AD. But the deity turned his head aside marking his disapproval. However, Raja Desigh in haste proceeded with his war plans and was killed. Dumont notes Raja Desingh had his own loyal Muslim ally, while Sadatullah Khan had Hindu advisors. In the legend and ballads, God Ranganatha worried at the raja's plans to proceed with the battle, appears in front of Desingh's young wife who then seeks his permission for Sati. He tries to dissuade her at first but agrees at her insistence and blesses her and her deceased husband with boons.

The cars emitted much higher levels of pollution under real-world driving conditions. Some cars emissions were higher even though there was no manipulated software. Scandals relating to higher than reported emissions from diesel engines began in 2014, when the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) reported discrepancies between European and US models of vehicles, beginning with the VW scandal. Independent tests carried out by the German car club ADAC proved that, under normal driving conditions, diesel vehicles including the Volvo S60, Renault's Espace Energy and the Jeep Renegade, exceeded legal European emission limits for nitrogen oxide () by more than 10 times. ICCT and ADAC showed the biggest deviations from Volvo, Renault, Jeep, Hyundai, Citro√´n and Fiat.NOX control technologies for Euro 6 Diesel passenger cars, Market penetration and experimental performance assessment, Liuhanzi Yang, Vicente Franco, Alex Campestrini, John German, and Peter Mock. ICCT in collaboration with ADAC, 3 September 2015. Researchers have criticized the inadequacy of current regulations and called for the use of a UN-sanctioned test called Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedures that better reflects real-life driving conditions. The test only came into force in 2017, with critics saying that car firms lobbied fiercely to delay its implementation due to the high cost of meeting stricter environmental controls. Conservative Internal Market spokesman Daniel Dalton \\\\- who led the legislation through the European Parliament - described the previous regulations as \\"at best patchy and at worst ineffective.\\" and said his latest 2018 report introduced a strong, transparent system to ensure cars are safe and meet emissions standards. thumbupright=2Nitrogen oxide (NOx) on-road emissions by manufacturer and capacity Since 2016, 38 out of 40 diesel cars tested by ADAC failed a -test.  Manufacturers  = Volkswagen = The Volkswagen emissions scandal started on 18 September 2015, when the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to German automaker Volkswagen Group. Volkswagen had intentionally programmed Turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engines to activate emissions controls only during emissions testing. In January 2017, VW pleaded guilty to the emissions scandal and to pay US$4.3 billion in penalties. As of January 2019, 13 VW employees have been indicted, including former CEO Martin Winterkorn, and two former executives (Oliver Schmidt and James Robert Liang) have pleaded guilty in US court and sentenced to prison terms. = Fiat Chrysler = On 12 January 2017, the EPA issued a notice of violation in 2017 to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) alleging that over 100,000 model year 2014, 2015, and 2016 diesel SUVs and trucks, including Dodge Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee trucks had software that allowed them to exceed NOx pollution limits, undetected by the usual testing methods. The EPA discovered this during their expanded vehicle tests following the Volkswagen case. FCA was not accused of intentionally cheating on emissions testing, though the EPA did accuse the company of failing to notify the government of the defeat device programming. The US Justice Department was assisting the EPA in their investigation, suggesting the possibility of criminal charges, while FCA executives were hopeful that after the inauguration of President Donald Trump it would be possible to \\"work with the new administration to try and get this issue behind us\\", according to FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne. Executives denied any wrongdoing but stated to make extensive changes to their vehicle software to address the EPA's concerns. As part of a January 2019 settlement, Fiat Chrysler will recall and repair approximately 100,000 automobiles equipped with a 3.0-liter V6 EcoDiesel engine having a prohibited defeat device, pay $311 million in total civil penalties to US regulators and CARB, pay $72.5 million for state civil penalties, implement corporate governance reforms, and pay $33.5 million to mitigate excess pollution. The company will also pay affected consumers up to $280 million and offer extended warranties on such vehicles worth $105 million. The total value of the settlement is worth about $800 million, though FCA did not admit liability, and it did not resolve an ongoing criminal investigation. In connection with the mentioned software, Emanuele Palma, a diesel drivability and emissions senior manager at Fiat Chrysler, was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, to violate the Clean Air Act and to commit wire fraud. Palma was also charged with six counts of violating the Clean Air Act, four counts of wire fraud and two counts of making false statements to representatives of the FBI and the EPA's Criminal Investigation Division (EPA-CID).  Jeep  Jeep, also manufactured by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles was tested by the consumer group Which? and in March 2017 found to produce NOx compared to the 2009 European emission standards Euro 5 legal limit of . = Nissan = In September 2015 Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said it would be difficult for an automaker to conceal internally an effort to falsify vehicle emissions data, as happened at Volkswagen AG: \\"I don't think you can do something like this hiding in the bushes.\\" In May 2016, South Korean authorities accused Nissan of using a defeat device for manipulating emissions data for the British-built Nissan Qashqai, allegations which the Japanese carmaker denied. In March 2017, Nissan vehicles tested by Which? were found to produce NOx compared to the 2009 European emission standards Euro 5 legal limit of . = Renault = Renault issued press statements reaffirming their vehicles' compliance with all regulations and legislation for the markets in which they operate in 2015. Headquarters of Renault and Peugeot were raided by fraud investigators in January and April 2016, respectively. Renault subsequently recalled 15,000 cars for emission testing and fixing. Since 2015, Renault has been investigated by the French Direction g√©n√©rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r√©pression des fraudes (DGCCRF). Their 2017 report states ‚Äúthe suspicion of the installation of a ‚Äòfraudulent device‚Äô which specifically modifies the functioning of the engine to reduce emissions of NOx (nitrogen oxides) in conditions specific to the regulatory tests.‚Äù It affects 900,000 vehicles. Renault Captur and Clio IV exceeded the threshold for carbon dioxide emissions by 377% and 305%. In 2019, Renault‚Äôs Clio and Captur diesel models were found to emit more pollutants outside official test conditions, their exhaust treatment did not work in everyday use when outside temperature range was below or above those covering official tests. Furthermore, their ‚ÄúNOx trap‚Äù devices did not run cleaning cycles below , causing those filters to clog and became ineffective. = Mercedes-Benz = Even though up to 2018 there were increasingly specific allegations of defeat devices in the control software for Mercedes Benz U.S. cars, Mercedes Benz denies the charges. As of June 24, 2019 Daimler insisted its diesels didn‚Äôt break the law. European vehicle emissions rules were loosely written. Turning down or switching off emission controls to protect the engine in certain circumstances ‚Äì such as lower temperatures ‚Äì was allowed. Earlier, Feb 2018, German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that US authorities investigating Mercedes have discovered that its vehicles are equipped with illegal software to help them pass United States' stringent emission tests. The claimed defeat devices include a mode to switch off emissions control after 16 miles of driving (the length of an official U.S. emissions test), and which tries to directly determine if the car is being tested based on speed and acceleration profiles. In June 2019 Daimler recalled 60,000 Mercedes diesel powered cars in Germany, the model affected is the Mercedes-Benz GLK 220 SUV produced between 2012 and 2015, car is fitted with software aimed at distorting emissions tests. Germany‚Äôs vehicle authority, the Federal Motor Transport Authority is looking to extend investigations of cheating devices reportedly used in Daimler‚Äôs C-Class and E-Class OM642 and OM651 engines. The number could be as high as 700,000 vehicles. Daimler to recall 60,000 Mercedes diesels in Germany over emissions: Daimler to recall 60,000 Mercedes diesels in Germany over emissions, accessdate: 25. June 2019 https://www.bild.de/geld/wirtschaft/wirtschaft/neue- diesel-affaere-zwangsrueckruf-gegen-daimler-62796534.bild.html In September 2019, Daimler was fined 870 million euros in Germany for \\"negligent violation of supervisory duties\\" in relation to not fully complying with emissions regulations. = Audi & Porsche = In July 2019, Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) (German Environmental Aid) published a press release in which it states that Porsche-vehicles equipped with Audi-diesel-engines of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 emission standards exceed the limit values for nitrogen oxides (NOx) many times over. The statutory NOx limit for diesel passenger cars Euro 5 is 180 mg NOx / km. The Porsche Panamera equipped with the VW-EA897 engine, made by Audi, exhibited an 8.3-fold limit violation with an average NOx emissions of 1,498 mg/km, according to DUH. According to DUH data, the measurements were made at outside temperatures between +10 and +14 ¬∞C. Two Porsche Cayenne with the EA897evo engine (Euro 6) are said to have exceeded the applicable limit of 80 mg/km NOx in normal mode by 3.6 or 4.2 times. Exceeding the Cayenne in normal mode increases according to DUH in sport mode with the same driving style by two times. Also the arranged software update by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt) does not prevent exceeding the limit. A tested Porsche Cayenne, emission standard Euro 6, exceeds the limit by 2.4 times at +10 to +16¬∞C with an average of 191 mg NOx /km after the software update. In addition, the vehicle with a carbon dioxide emissions of 179 g CO2/km is permitted, but in real operation on the road, according to DUH, the emissions are on average 241 g CO2/km. In addition to the diesel passenger car Audi A8 4.2 TDI with emission standard Euro 6, which according to own data was measured on average 1.422 mg NOx/km, also showed further new measurements on Audi Models High NOx Limit Exceedances. An examined Audi SQ5 plus 3.0 TDI with emission standard Euro 6, with the same engine generation (EA897evo) as the Porsche Cayenne, emits an average of 441 mg NOx/ km at outside temperatures between +4 and +11¬∞C. The measurements were carried out by the DUH according to the press release on the road using PEMS. Initiated by the measurements, the DUH called on the manufacturers to publish a complete overview of all installed defeat devices for every diesel vehicle and to commit themselves to repair the diesel exhaust gas cleaning for all affected diesel buyers to help a legally compliant vehicle - or to reimburse them the full purchase price. It also announced that it will make the measurements results available to law enforcement agencies, the European Antitrust Authority and all concerned stakeholders and their lawyers. At the same time renewed the DUH their criticism of the Federal Motor Transport Authority and of Andreas Scheuer (Head of Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure), who according to the DUH-President on the one hand restraint documents about the detected defeat devices in the vehicles, despite final convictions for disclosure, and secondly prevent officially ordered hardware retrofits.  Previous defeat device cases  The Volkswagen TDI diesel emissions case is not the first use of defeat devices by Volkswagen or other automakers nor the first time automakers have taken advantage of their foreknowledge of the specific lab test conditions in order to engage emissions controls only during testing, but not during normal driving. In 1973 Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen had to remove ambient temperature switches which affected emissions, though the companies denied intentional cheating and said that strategies like enriching fuel mixture during cold engine warm-up periods could reduce overall pollution. The switches were ordered removed from production but cars already on the road did not have to be recalled, and fines were relatively modest. In 1996, GM had to pay a near- record fine of $11 million, and recall 470,000 vehicles, because of ECU software programmed to disengage emissions controls during conditions known to exist when the cars were not being lab tested by the EPA. The model year 1991‚Äì1995 Cadillacs were programmed to simply enrich the engine's fuel mixture, increasing carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) pollution, any time the car's air conditioning or heater was turned on, since the testing protocol specified they would be off. In 1996, Fiat of Brazil paid a record fine because of the Fiat Mille Electronic, a very popular version of the Fiat Uno with a 1.0-litre engine. They sold 500,000 vehicles with a combination of carburettor and digital ignition that uses different strategies for laboratory or street driving conditions. In 1998, Honda Motor Company had to spend $267 million to correct the disabling of the misfire monitoring device on 1.6 million 1996 and 1997 model year vehicles, and Ford Motor Company paid $7.8 million for programming 60,000 1997 Ford Econoline vans to exceed emissions standards during normal highway cruising speeds. A timer- based strategy was used by seven heavy truck manufacturers, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Engine Company, Detroit Diesel Corporation, Mack Trucks, Navistar International, Renault V√©hicules Industriels, and Volvo Trucks, who in 1998 paid the largest ever fine to date, $83.4 million, for, in the same manner as Volkswagen, programming trucks to keep emissions low during the test cycle, and then disabling the controls and emitting up to three times the maximum during normal highway driving. The goal of both the Ford and the heavy truck defeat devices was better fuel economy than could be achieved under pollution limits. The major truck manufacturers also had to spend up to $1 billion to correct the problem, which affected 1.3 million heavy duty diesel trucks. While Volkswagen's actions have precedents, the Center for Auto Safety's Clarence Ditlow said that Volkswagen \\"took it to another level of sophisticated deception we've never seen before.\\"  EU vehicle approval procedures  In May 2017, the 28 EU member states agreed to begin negotiations with EU institutions to revise the method of testing vehicle emissions towards real circumstances, with random testing of vehicles on the roads and fines for manufacturers who breach the rules. Eben Moglen has suggested in 2010 to make proprietary software source code in general accessible to the public, to curb cheating.VW's Cheating Proves We Must Open Up the Internet of Things, Klint Finley, Wired, 24 September 2015.Volkswagen's Diesel Fraud Makes Critic of Secret Code a Prophet, NY Times, 22 September 2015.

The report was issued on 6 July 2005 at the request of and to the Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone. The inquiry also initially looked at the \\"Vivian Alverez Matter\\", an incident with some similarities, which was taken up and completed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Neil Comrie. Background Cornelia Rau, a lawful citizen, was found to have spent 10 months in immigration detention despite being registered as a \\"missing patient\\". This was closely followed by another similar issue, that of Vivian Alverez Solon, who was deported to the Philippines, despite being a lawful citizen, and despite also being registered as a missing person by her family. Criticism The incidents received a lot of press and public outrage at the time, with both incidents concerning mental health patients not properly being identified as citizens of Australia. There was a fear that these incidents were not isolated and could happen again. Criticism of the inquiries at inception were that they were of a non-judicial nature, were closed and had limited terms of reference. Outcome The inquiry identified a number of shortcomings in the process of arrest and detention, and made a number of recommendations. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs accepted most of the recommendations though it is not clear if all of them have been implemented. The absence of known similar incidents since indicates that the report, recommendations, and consequential implementation may have been successful.

He played an important role with regard to the development of monetary economics and the direction of British central banking.  Biography  Richard Sidney Sayers was born as the fifth in a family of seven to Sidney James Sayers, an accountant for West Suffolk's county council, and Caroline Mary Watson. Sayers attended various schools in Bury St Edmunds from 1912 to 1926 and became head prefect in his last two years at West Suffolk County School. In 1926, he entered St Catharine's College at Cambridge University and took first classes in both parts of the economics tripos. At Cambridge and later in life, Sayers was a friend of John Maynard Keynes, whose Political Economy Club Sayers was a member of, as well as a friend of Dennis Robertson, to whom he often sent drafts prior to publication. Sayers married Millicent Hodson, an old classmate of his and the daughter of William Henry John Hodson, a brewery bookkeeper, in 1930. Unfortunately and in spite of two children, the marriage wasn't happy. Sayers was appointed as assistant lecturer at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1931 after completing his postgraduate studies at Cambridge University. He remained at LSE until 1935, when he became a lecturer at Oxford University, being made a fellow of Pembroke College in 1939. In 1936 Sayers published Bank of England Operations, 1890-1914, in which he studied the activities of England's central bank in the Edwardian era. Needing money in light of his growing family, Sayers published Modern Banking, his internationally known textbook on banking, in 1938, throughout which he emphasized the importance of liquidity, his scepticism regarding the effectiveness and manageability of the bank rate, and his reservations concerning unsupported monetary policy. During World War II, Sayers worked in the Ministry of Supply, where he was involved in negotiations for the development of uranium supplies, a topic related to the construction of the nuclear bomb. In 1945, James Meade convinced Sayers to accept the position of deputy director of the Economic Section of the Cabinet Office. Sayers and Meade, by then the section's director, both moved from the Cabinet Office back to academia in 1947, where Sayers accepted the Sir Ernest Cassel Chair of Economics at the LSE. He remained there until his early retirement in 1968, 21 years later. Throughout the 1950s, Sayers produced or edited six books, including Financial Policy, 1939-45 and his history of Lloyd Banks. Financial Policy, which was published in 1956 and took Sayers five years to complete, gave a gripping yet truthful account of the wartime Treasury and the economic and political challenges it had to deal at that time. A testament to Sayers' skill as a historian and writer, the book became part of the official war history. which became part of the official war history and on which he worked for more than five years. In 1957 Sayers was appointed to the Committee on the Working of the Monetary System, where he examined most witnesses and drafted key section of the committee's official report. However, Sayers grew to be bitterly disappointed with the report's reception after it was published in 1959. This disappointment notwithstanding, Sayers went on to publish dozens of essays, articles and books in the following three decades, and was very often requested as a historian of financial institution. In this context, he was considered as a possible historian of the U.S. federal reserve system and wrote a post-1914 sequel to the official history of the Bank of England. This history was completed in 1976 and earned Sayers the offer of a knighthood, which he refused. In addition to his academic work, Sayers was an editorial adviser of the Three Banks Review in 1948-1968 and closely associated with the editing of Economica. Moreover, he was made a fellow of the British Academy in 1957 and held its vice presidency in 1966-67, whereafter he worked from 1969 to 1974 as its publications secretary. After many years of unhappy marriage, Sayers at last left his wife in 1985 and further lived with Audrey Taylor, an old associate of his.  Sources  * Cairncross, A. (1990).

The first 11 levels can be traversed via a 60-step spiral staircase, while a ladder is needed to ascend to the final level. Various levels have tables, birdwatching, meditation facilities, and views. It has electrical and telephone service, as well as several porch swings, and a microwave oven. It also includes a long flower box, rope lights, and a grill. There are models of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway bridge and the Marsh Rainbow Arch Bridge that can both be crossed by visitors. A skyway, styled \\"Skywalk 2000\\", winds around the tenth level, the spiral staircase, and the model of the Rainbow Bridge. History Michael Jurgensen, whose family owns the Shady Oak Campground, first conceived the project while a college student in spring 1983. He had six pallets of wood sent to Shady Oak Campground and started building by the side of a maple tree. By summer 1983 the first floor and part of the second floor was complete. He makes new additions each year.

It was once the largest congregational chapel in South Wales. It was demolished in the 1970s. Early history The building which became the church was built in 1858, initially as a temperance hall. It was built as part of Temperance Town, a grid of small streets which formerly occupied much of the area to the north of Cardiff Central railway station. Within a year of opening, the building became a music hall and a circus. The acrobat Charles Blondin performed there in the early 1860s. In the later years of the decade, the building came to the attention of minister William Watkiss (1827-1892), who believed that it would be an ideal venue to fill with crowds of unchurched working people.Rose, J. Cardiff Churches Through Time. Amberley. 2013. p.48 Purchase and scandal Watkiss was assisted in his endeavours by a Mr Ashton, a prominent member of his existing congregation. Under Ashton's expectations, the building was purchased, the local businesses lent generously to the cause, and many residents lent their savings. When the repayment was due, Ashton simply disappeared, never to be seen again. He reportedly left behind ¬£3, a carpet bag and an old coat, and had absconded with ¬£600 in cash () and about the same amount in goods, all on credit. A play called Ashton's Little Game based on the events was written, and was staged at the Theatre Royal to packed audiences.http://www.capeli.org.uk/uploads/newsletter_05.pdf Fortunately, the Hannah Street Congregational Church (which closed in 2002), together with emergency donations from generous individuals, saved the new church and Watkiss went on to have a successful career as minister. The first service was held on 28 September 1868. Subsequent history After renovations and extensions in 1896, Wood Street was the largest Congregational church in South Wales, with 2000 people regularly attending its services. Although the scandal had not been fatal, the church's finances remained delicate until the late 1910s. In , an adjoining building, the Rapers Hotel, was purchased by the Cardiff & District Congregational Board, and was used by Wood Street as a Sunday School. Archives Wales. Retrieved 2017-03-31. The Big Tent Mission, one of the earliest Evangelist movements, pitched its camp behind the church in 1923.The Victorian and Edwardian Churches, Cardiffmuseum.co.uk. Retrieved 2017-03-31. The two World Wars, combined with the Great Depression, caused the church to fall on leaner times. Temperance Town was demolished in the late 1930s, depriving the church of many of its attendees. The building subsequently fell into a poor condition. In 1964, three young architectural students inspected the run-down building, and discovered that it had several unusual construction quirks: doors that led nowhere, windows which were actually false, and five doors facing onto Havelock Street which had brick walls behind them.Hall, M. The Cardiff Book of Days. History Press. 2011. Demolition After a final service in November 1971, the church closed after 103 years of worship. In 1973, it was demolished and replaced with an office building. It is commemorated with a blue plaque at the location. Blue Plaque. Retrieved 2017-03-31.

He worked in stockbroker's office in London and in 1880s he emigrated to South Africa and than to Western Australia in early 1890 following the Ashburton rush. In January 1891, he settled in Southern Cross, where he worked as a merchant and stockbroker. Three years later, he moved his operations at Coolgardie, where a promising gold field had been just discovered.Alfred Chandler, \\"Men I Remember: Howard Taylor, a Spectacular Speculator\\", The Sunday Times, 11 July 1937, p. 21 Sitting at the town council, he was elected on 3 August 1896 one of the three members of the Western Australian Legislative Council for the East Province. He was one of the ten Western Australia representatives at the 1897-1898 Australasian Federal Convention, which prepared the federation. He left the council in 1899 to focus on speculative developments. He made estimated 250,000 pounds in speculating in Australia, before moving back to Europe to speculate on London Stock Exchange. In late 1890s, Tylor bought from Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi a racing cutter Bona Fide (or just Bona), build for the duke in 1897. Taylor began competing in sailing races in Mediterranean winning Queen's Cup at Royal Cork Regatta in 1899 and 16 races in 25 starts in 1900 season. That year he also participated in 1900 Summer Olympics sailing competitions in Paris, France. Taylor missed the first race of the Olympic regattas, as he was delayed obtaining clearance by French Customs, but he arrived at Meulan in time for the second race which he won by a margin of more than five minutes, taking the gold in the 3 to 10 ton class. After the Olympic, Taylor sold his winning yacht. Tylors speculations on London Stock Exchange were initially successful, but in few years left him broke. He returned to Australia and lived until death in Melbourne where he regularly played bridge. He died in 1925 in Melbourne and was buried in Melbourne General Cemetery. He was one-time member Coolgardie Masonic Lodge and Royal Yacht Club. He gave name to Howard Street in Perth.

The church is located at Kochchikade, Kotahena, Colombo 13, and is dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua. The church is designated a national shrine and minor basilica. A tiny piece of St. Anthony's tongue is preserved in a special reliquary, which is located in a glass case together with a statue of the saint, at the entrance to the church.  History  Easter bombings The church's origins relate to the early Dutch colonial period when Catholicism was banned from the island, with Catholic priests carrying out sermons from hiding places. Fr. Antonio disguised himself as a local merchant, finding refuge with a local fishing community at Mutwal. According to local legends the community sought his help to stop the sea eroding their village, and Fr. Antonio planted a cross and prayed at the beach, resulting in the sea receding and the community converting to Catholicism. The Dutch authorities then allocated him some land to carry out his sermons, whereupon he built a mud brick chapel dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua (Sant'Antonio da Padova). Fr. Antonio is buried within the church. In 1806, the chapel was enlarged, and in 1822 one of the members of the Congregation went to Goa and brought back a statue of St. Anthony, which still resides on one of the church's altars. Construction of a new church commenced in 1828 and it was consecrated on 1 June 1834. The church was built in the Neoclassical style. In 1938 the church was improved and enlarged, with the addition of a chorister's gallery, large wings on side, and a mission house and meeting room behind the main altar. The enlarged church was consecrated on 16 February 1940. Postal stamps worth five rupees were issued by the Sri Lankan government to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the church on 13 June 2010. On 21 April 2019, Easter Sunday, the church was one in a series of targets of a string of suicide bomb blasts across Sri Lanka. At least 93 people were killed in the blast. On 9 June, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the church, and paid tribute to the victims. On 12 June 2019, the sacred historical church was renovated solely by the Sri Lanka Navy and was opened for the public for the first time since the attacks. Archbishop Malcolm Ranjith conducted a special liturgy, remembering the Easter Sunday attack victims. He addressed what he called failures of the Sri Lankan government and its leadership during the occasion.

The bridge carries the A4143. The bridge is of medieval origin, but was substantially reconstructed in the early 19th century, to support a tramroad, and in the mid 19th century, when the two bridges were combined. History A view of the bridge by J. M. W. Turner The bridge was originally known as Tudor Bridge, due to the historical tradition that it was built by Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford, who was also Baron Abergavenny. This supports a construction date of the mid-15th century. The early 19th century tramway, which originally ran parallel to the bridge, was constructed in 1811 by William Crossley. The tramway carried the Llanvihangel Railway from the canal at Llanfoist. In the mid-19th century the bridge and the tramway were combined. The bridge was the subject of two paintings by J. M. W. Turner dating from the 1790s. The first, Abergavenny Bridge, Monmouthshire, Clearing Up after a Showery Day, is held in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum The second, entitled Abergavenny Bridge, is held by The Tate but is not exhibited due to deterioration of the paintwork. In 2016 Monmouthshire County Council began a consultation on the construction of a pedestrian and cycleway bridge, 300m to the east of the Abergavenny Bridge. Description Archway of the bridge, as seen from the east The bridge has seven voussoired arches and cutwaters below. The parapets were rebuilt in the 20th century, and have flat coping stones.

Life and career Born in Newcastle West, County Limerick, Ireland, in 1934, and daughter of local solicitors, Robert and Kathleen Cussen, Ursula O'Farrell was educated in Laurel Hill School in Limerick, and subsequently in University College Dublin where she achieved a B.A (1956) and a Dip in Psychology (1981). She is one of the founding members of the Irish Association for Counselling in 1981, along with Odette Thompson (founder of the Hanly Centre for Addiction in Dun Laoghaire, Ireland in 1978), Ita McCraith, Joan McGowan and Kay Duffy. Carl Berkeley also played a pivotal role in the Association's beginnings [1]. Ursula O'Farrell was Cathaoirleach of the Irish Association for Counselling from 1991 to 1995, which became the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy Ursula O'Farrell set up her own private practice in the early 1980s, having successfully completed a two-year Diploma in Psychology at UCD. ‚ÄòI was a fledgling counsellor ‚Ä¶ It was thrilling, I loved every busy minute of it ‚Ä¶ but it was terrifying too.‚Äô [2] At that time in Ireland there was a stigma attached to mental illness and to the idea of being in need of counselling. Today it is generally realised that professional help can be invaluable, and much of this change of attitude, according to the former President of Ireland Mary McAleese, is due to the ‚Ä≥hard work and dedication of the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy‚Ä≥. Ursula O'Farrell has written 4 books on counselling, and also compiled a book of some of the 'Topical Talks' written by her late husband Myles O'Farrell, which featured in the 1960s RT√â (Ireland's National Television and Radio Broadcaster) radio series of the same name. In her best known work, 'First Steps in Counselling', which offers a comprehensive coverage of all aspects of counselling, and has been updated in later additions, to take account of the many changes in Ireland since its first publication in 1988, she states: If people are not satisfied with their lives as they are, they look for a different tomorrow. They are searching for change. In 'Considering Counselling' O'Farrell provides an introduction to the Person-Centred Approach pioneered by Carl Rogers, explaining the basic theory and practice of this approach using some fascinating case studies.

Written by David Ebeltoft, the film premiered at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival and was released theatrically on March 30, 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics.  Plot  Sometime after a zombie-like infection decimates the world's population, Ann (Lucy Walters) struggles to survive in the woods. There are few resources and she is forced to live off the land, as abandoned houses attract dangerous, infected corpses. Throughout, Ann clings to the hope of civilization, listening to a crank radio that broadcasts an emergency message in French, a language she does not understand, and other reminders of her past life. That past life includes her husband, Jason (Shane West), and child, an infant daughter. They are gone, and the movie explains their fate through a series of flashbacks. On her way back from getting food from a nearby home, Ann comes across an injured man, Chris (Adam David Thompson), and his teenage stepdaughter, Olivia (Gina Piersanti). She helps them, nursing Chris back to health, but finds it difficult to trust him or Olivia. A short time later, Chris and Olivia are about to leave when a storm rolls in; Ann allows them to stay a little while longer. Time passes and Chris and Ann form a romantic relationship, much to Olivia's irritation. It is revealed later on that after leaving to find supplies for Ann and their daughter during the night, Jason was attacked and killed by the infected, leaving Ann to protect their child. One day, when she leaves to find food, she kills one of the infected; unknown to Ann, blood splatters onto her coat. She returns to find her daughter crying but unharmed. When Ann comforts her, the blood from her coat accidentally gets in her daughter's mouth. Ann's daughter develops circular rashes on her belly, a telltale sign of infection. Left with no other options, Ann grinds up a bottle of aspirin, mixes it with baby formula, including dropplets of her own blood,and feeds it to her daughter. Ann decides to go North with Chris and Olivia. To do this, they must gather food from the house Ann has regularly searched so that they're able to make the journey; while Chris distracts the infected gathered in the yard, Ann and Olivia sneak into the house and start searching for food. While Ann is distracted, Olivia knocks her out, ties her up, screams, then takes the food and runs back to camp. Ann escapes, then finds Olivia and Chris under attack by the infected that Olivia drew with her scream. Only Olivia and Ann have survived. In the car, driving down the road, Olivia rests her head on Ann's lap; Ann screams.

He is noted for his part in the 1857 Indian Rebellion, and his vindictive behaviour in the aftermath. Early life Born at Delhi 28 November 1828, he was eldest son of Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalfe, 4th Baronet, by his second wife Felicity Annie Browne, the daughter of J. Browne, of the Bengal Medical Board. Theophilus Metcalfe was first sent to Addiscombe College, but was moved to East India College, after an illness had cost him the use of his right eye, ruling out a military career. In 1848 he entered the Bengal Civil Service. Documentation of the Koh-i-Noor In 1849 the Treaty of Lahore transferred possession of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Maharaja Duleep Singh to Governor- General Lord Dalhousie. As part of preparations for sending the diamond to England, Dalhousie tasked Metcalfe with writing a history of the Koh-i-Noor. His instructions were \\"to collect and record as much accurate and interesting information regarding the Koh-i-Noor\\" as he could find. After interviewing courtiers, jewelers, and local gossips he drafted a report about which he said, \\"I cannot but regret that the results are so very meagre and imperfect\\". Still, this report was the earliest account of the history of the Koh-i-Noor which anyone has been able to find. Metcalfe's report is the basis for most histories of the Koh-i-Noor describing it before 1849. Activities during 1857 Indian Rebellion Metcalfe joined his father at Delhi, and succeeded to the baronetcy in 1853. In 1857 Metcalfe was appointed joint-magistrate and deputy-collector, first grade, at Meerut, and deputy-collector at Futtepore. On the morning of 11 May 1857 he brought information to Delhi that Meerut mutineers of the previous day were crossing the river to the city. He aided the escape of European inhabitants, and himself reached safety with the help of the Nawab of Jhajjar. Metcalfe went to George Anson's army at Kurnaul. On 6 June he was there when the Corps of Guides arrived on its march towards the siege of Delhi. He diverted the Guides into punitive attacks on villages, and the corps was delayed from the Battle of Badli-ki-Serai. Views of Metcalfe House, Delhi, from 1843 At Delhi Metcalfe led the cavalry that attacked the rebels' rear at the Battle of Najafgarh, and during the assault of 14 September guided George Campbell, with the 52nd light infantry, in the street fighting. The family residence, Metcalfe House, had been gutted by the rebels, and burned. After Delhi fell, Metcalfe exacted retribution. He did not intervene to save the Nawab of Jhajjar, and the impression was gained that he, rather than the commissioner Charles Saunders, was in charge. Metcalfe was appointed assistant to the agent at Delhi and deputy-collector at Futtepore in 1858, and went home on sick furlough in 1859. Ill-health prevented his return to India. He was made C.B. in 1864, and retired on an invalid pension in 1866. He died in Paris, 10 November 1883, aged 54. Family Metcalfe married: first, in 1851, Charlotte, daughter of Sir John Low, died at Simla in 1853, leaving one child, Sir Charles Herbert Theophilus Metcalfe, 6th Baronet (1853‚Äì1928), a civil engineer; and secondly, in 1876, Katherine Hawkins, daughter of James Whitehead Dempster of Dunnichen, Forfarshire.

It was the first community radio station, conceived as a direct response to the high levels of illiteracy in rural communities at the time. Radio Sutatenza was established in 1947 by the Catholic priest Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Salcedo Guar√≠n in the Colombian town of Sutatenza, located in the Tenza Valley, Boyac√°, who founded the Escuelas Radiof√≥nicas (Radio Schools). Radio Sutatenza was conceived as a direct response to the high levels of illiteracy in rural communities at the time. Radio Sutatenza was granted a license from the then Colombian Ministry of Communications with the call sign HK7HM. Initial broadcasts used a 90-watt transmitter manufactured by the priest's brother. In 1948, General Electric donated 100 radio sets and a 250-watt transmitter and, years later, donated a 1 kW transmitter. By 1978, Radio Sutatenza was the largest Latin American radio network for rural education, with a power of 600 kW. It started with programs where the farmers performed local music. Later, Father Salcedo, with the support of a Catholic organization called Acci√≥n Cultural Popular ‚Äì ACPO ‚Äì and the rural community, developed a series of courses on math, writing, agricultural instruction, health and sanitation, among other subjects that aimed to diminish illiteracy and improve farmers' life quality. Even though it was not a Catholic radio, it was mainly funded by the Church and it was blessed by Pope Paul VI during his papal visit to Colombia in 1968. Radio Sutatenza freely talked about topics that were not strictly within in the church's ideas, such as family planning. Radio Sutatenza grew to the point where it aired 19 hours of educational programs per day, covering 687 towns and four main Colombian cities at the time. It distributed 6,453,937 handbooks, answered 1,229,552 letters from students, it created a weekly newspaper called El Campesino, and educated about 8,000,000 farmers around the country. It also became a model for other rural education initiatives in Latin America, such as Fundaci√≥n Radio Escuela para el Desarrollo Rural (FREDER) in Osorno, Chile; Instituto de Cultura Popular (INCUPO) in Reconquista, Argentina; Escuelas Radiof√≥nicas Populares de Ecuador (ERPE); Radio Onda Azul in Puno, Per√∫; Asociaci√≥n Cultural Loyola (ACLO) in Sucre, Bolivia; Radio Occidente in Tovar, Venezuela, and Escuelas Radiof√≥nicas de Nicaragua. Despite its important role in improving the education of millions of people, by the late 1980s Radio Sutatenza was on the verge of bankruptcy and ended being sold in March 1989, with its powerful transmitters, to Caracol Radio, the largest radio network in Colombia. The last broadcast was made on 17 February 1990. The rest of the literacy project by ACPO folded by 1994.

Zolt√°n Kod√°ly‚Äôs widow and the primary and secondary Kod√°ly school‚Äôs director, M√°rta Nemesszeghyn√© Szentkir√°lyi had an idea about an international summer course. For their initiation the city advertised this course for learning the Hungarian music teaching in schools and the method‚Äôs basics. A lot of people interested in this course, so after two years the International Kod√°ly Seminar was held again, second time. The first was in 1970 and the second, two years later, in 1972.

It is also the origin of many Guangzhou local brands' names. The name 'Five Goats' can earliest be seen in poetry of Tang dynasty, and the related legendry can be dated back to Jin dynasty. Though the legendary had several versions, it was unified after Ming dynasty. Usually the Legend of Five Goats reflects the history that Lingnan people was colonized by Zhongyuan ancestors. In 2007, this legend was collected into the first batch of The Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity of Guangzhou.  Content of the Legend of Five Goats  It is said that in ancient Guangzhou, there was a time when a drought lasted many years. Food was in extremely short supply and people struggled to avoid starvation. One day, suddenly, a holy melody spread in the air and a five-colour cloud drifted in the sky from the South China Sea. Then five gods, who were wearing five different colours of clothing and rode five different coloured goats, appeared with the cloud, each one held a sheaf of wheat with six stalks. They gave the wheat to the people, left the five goats, and they left by the clouds. People spread the grains to the ground. From then on, Guangzhou had regular winds and rains and rich harvests, and the five god goats became stone goat, standing on the hill. This is how the nicknames of Guangzhou came about.  Ancient Records  The literal recordings of this legendary can be dated back to Jin Dynasty, during which Pei Yuan wrote in his essay Guangzhou Ji.' Taiping Yulan (The Northern Song Dynasty, in 983) also refers to the descriptions of 'Guangzhou Ji'‚Äî‚ÄúOn the Guangzhou court hall's beam, there are images of the five goats. People also made bags for grains, which hangs under the images. It is said that when Gao Gu was the Prime Minister of Chu, five goats held the grains to Chu, so the people painted for them...Guangzhou has vast plain, so the paints are auspicious signs.‚Äù It also refers to Junguo Zhi of Tang Dynasty, \\"Guangzhou, when Teng Xiu was minister of the state of Eastern Wu during the late Three Kingdoms period, he came to Wei State. Five gods rode five different-color goats came and picked him and went away. Now people drew the pictures of the five gods and five goats for luck.\\" Taiping Huanyu Ji, which was written in 984 continued on the record of Xunan Yuezhi of Tang Dynasty and said, \\"There is an old saying that five gods came, riding five-color goats with six grains‚Äù. It shall be noticed that the earliest version of Jin Dynasty does not have the gods. The reason why it appeared and replaced the five goats and became the heroes in the later versions is because of the popularity of Taoism in Northern and Southern dynasties. After Tang Dynasty, ‚ÄúFive Goats‚Äù and ‚ÄúCity of the Goat‚Äù gradually became nicknames of the ancient Guangzhou city, which perfectly shows the legends‚Äô influences on local people. According to the fantastic legendary stories of Tang Dynasty, at that time, people had sacrificed five goats in the temples of the Town God. And the earliest similar convention was in Southern Han, when people built ‚ÄúFive Gods Taoist temples‚Äù to worship the gods. Zhang Li, military commissioner the Northern Song Dynasty during Zhenghe's era, recorded the five goats‚Äô legend completely in Rebuilding the Five Gods Temple of Guangzhou and illustrated that the purpose of building the Five Gods‚Äô Temple was to memory the place where the five gods arrived. In this record, Zhang quoted Nanyue Lingbiao Youji and Tu Jing and made the story more specific, ‚ÄúAt the very beginning, there were five gods, each holding a wheat with six stalks, arrived riding five goats. Their clothes and goats are all in different colors, which is altogether five. After they had left the wheats to the people, the gods flew away and the goats became stone statues. So the Guangzhou people built a temple at the place where the gods arrived.‚Äù In terms of the specific time of the legendary, the recordings vary in different versions. Taiping Yulan thinks there are two versions, which are relatively during Chu and Teng Xiu's inauguration in the Three Kingdoms period. Rebuilding the Five Gods Temple of Guangzhou has three versions, they are: Zhao Tuo‚Äôs period in Han Dynasty; Teng Xiu in Wu Dynasty of The Three Kingdoms Period and Guo Pu in Jin Dynasty. But in Guangdong Xinyu, written by Qu Dajun, who lived at the end of Ming Dynasty and the beginning of Qing Dynasty, said that this story happened during king Yi of Zhou. ‚ÄòThe Five Goat Stone‚Äô in this book recorded, ‚Äúduring Yi‚Äôs time of Zhou Period, there were five gods in the Southern sea, each wore clothes in different color, and their goats‚Äô color are separately in accordance with their clothes. They each appeared with a wheat with six stalks and then left them to the people, and wished, ‚Äòwish the earth has no starvation anymore‚Äô. They flew away after saying this, and the goats turned into stones.‚Äù This version is quite similar to the modern ones, for it contains all the key elements of the legendary.  Symbolic Meanings  After the 20th century, people began to carry on mythic study of 'The Legend of Five Goats'. Famous historian Ceng Zhongmian rose an opinion in 1948 that the legendary and related stories are pre-historical colonial myths. Because at that time, goat is livestock of Northwestern part of Zhongyuan in China, where for Guangzhou is in the north. What is more, the wheat the gods holding were rice which represents harvest in Zhongyuan. So the historical origin of this legendary comes from a historical event: at the end of Western Zhou, Ji people could not bear the oppression of Chu people, so they moved south to Lingnan along the Xiang River, with livestock like goats and grains like wheats with them, and spread these two things in the south China in the following years. This is an extraction and improvement for the story of Yue people accepted the advanced culture of Zhongyuan and stepped into civilization. Modern studies usually think this legendary contains many historical events. One of them is Chu people brought high-producing rice to Lingnan. The surname of the ancestors of Chu‚Äôs royal family is ‚ÄúMi‚Äù (), which has the same meaning as ‚ÄúBaa‚Äù (‚ÄúMie‚Äù () in Chinese), which is also the onomatopoeia of goats. The second is as at the end of Western Zhou, due to the oppression of Chu, Ji people immigrated to Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta with goats and grains. The third is derived from Guangzhou Ji, in which it says that ‚ÄúWhen Gao Gu was the Prime Minister of king Wei of Chu‚Äù, so people thinks that during the Warring States Period, it was Gao Gu and his family that brought rice and grains to Guangzhou and the Zhujiang Delta. Gao Gu's offspring's surname is ‚ÄúJiang‚Äù (), which is consisted by ‚ÄúYang‚Äù (Áæä: goats) and ‚ÄúNv‚Äù (Â•≥: female) in Chinese characters, that is why people used goats to indicate Gao Gu's family. However, there are also scholars think ‚ÄúYang‚Äù (Goats) actually means ‚ÄúQuan‚Äù (Dogs) in Chu dialect, so the legendary of the five goats actually is adapted from the story \\"The Dogs Get Rice\\" from Zhuang and Dong minority as well as Nanyue minority. After this Lingnan story has been brought into Chu, it was collected and revised by Zhongyuan intellectuals and was brought into Lingnan again. So the ‚Äúfive colors goats‚Äù actually are five ‚Äúfive-colored dogs‚Äù‚Äî Panhu ().  Related Objects  = Names of Places and Buildings = Five Gods Taoism Temple The earliest physical ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of ‚ÄòThe Legendary of Five Goats‚Äô is the Five Gods Taoism Temple in Guangzhou. There has been a temple that in memory of the five gods in Northern Song Dynasty in Shixian Fang (now is around Provincial Financial Department in Guangren Road). During Jiading's time of Southern Song Dynasty, it moved to Yuye pond of West Lake, which is now near West Lake Avenue and is called ‚ÄúFengzhen Taoism Temple‚Äù. At the end of Nan Song, it moved to now Guangren Road. In 1368, Hongwu‚Äôs time of Ming Dynasty, it was destroyed in fire, so in 1377, it moved to Po Mountain and was kept until now. During the almost 700 years, there had been two renewals relatively in 1469 in Ming Dynasty and 1723 in Qing Dynasty. During the Republic of China (in 1923), in order to raise money for the war, the government sold it at auction and dismissed all the Taoist priests lived in the temple. After the establishment of People‚Äôs Republic China, the government nationalized it and authorized the Cultural Relics Management Department to manage it. After being repaired and renewed in 1980s, it opened to the public. In March in 1963, the temple was enlisted as the Protected Historic Site of Guangzhou city; in June of 1989, it was raised to the Protected Historic Site of Guangdong Province. Nowadays, in the Five Gods Taoism Temple, there are statues of five gods, accompanied with five goats, and the five gods are respected as ‚ÄúGods for Grains‚Äù. There is also a huge piece of red sandstone with a concave, which is more than one-meter-long and looks like a foot print. Thus it is called ‚ÄúThe Traces of God‚Äù. Except for the Five Gods Taoism Temple, there are several places that were given names related to the legendary in Guangzhou City. For example, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Neighbour Alley‚Äù located in Huifu West Road was named because it is near to the Temple. Zhuhai Mid Road was called ‚ÄúHoly Goats street‚Äù and ‚ÄúXihao Street‚Äù in Qing Dynasty, but was combined into one and became part of Zhuhai Road. During Jiajing‚Äôs time in Ming Dynasty, people built Guangzhou new city, and the Southern gate of the outer city was called ‚ÄúFive Goats Gate‚Äù, which was changed into ‚ÄúFive Gods Gate‚Äù during Qing Dynasty, and there was a ‚ÄúFive Goats post‚Äù near the gate. Besides, at the beginning of the 1900s, there was a ‚ÄúFive Goats power plant‚Äù. In Yuexiu Park, there is also a five-goat statue. It was built in 1959, and now is one of the most famous tourism spot in Guangzhou and is regarded as the landmark of Guangzhou city. The modern five-goats related places are Five Goats New City in Yuexiu District, as well as the Five-Goats secondary school and primary school, and the Five-Goats station on 5th line of Guangzhou Metro.  The Holy Dance of Five Goats  In Song Dynasty, people started to sacrifice live goats for the five gods, and the activity was held along with the holy dance. Modern scholars found the ‚ÄúHoly Dance of Five Goats‚Äù of Song Dynasty (in 1114) in Korea's classical book Jinzhuan Yigui, which is a typical official royal dance of Song Dynasty. Gaoli History and Jinzhuan Yigui recorded the performance of this dance: five dancers perform five holy goats, and the leader is the Queen Mother of the Gods, and there are two ‚ÄúZhuganzi‚Äù who are responsible for the aside, and over ten persons who hold flags, joints, dragon fans and phoenix fans, standing on both sides to form a team for the performance. At the very beginning of the dance, the Queen Mother stands in the middle and the four ‚Äúgoats‚Äù stand aside. The band performs music‚Äî‚ÄúWuyun Kairui Chao‚Äù, the ‚ÄúZhuganzi‚Äù then step into the stage and recite the ode lyrics after the music. When ‚ÄúWuyun Kairui Chao‚Äù ends after being played twice, the Queen Mother comes forward, give a speech, and then back to the team. Then follows the music ‚ÄúWanYE Zhiyao Tu‚Äù, and the five persons perform the ‚ÄúFive Goats Dance‚Äù; then follows the melody of ‚ÄúBuxu Ziqu‚Äù, the five persons sing and dance, and the team standing on both sides will join the chorus. Finally, the ‚ÄúWuyun Kairui Chao‚Äù music will be played again, the ‚ÄúZhuganzi‚Äù and the Queen Mother give speech separately, then the performance ends. = Brands = Guangzhou city has many companies and commercial brands that are named after ‚Äúfive goats‚Äù, such as the Guangzhou Five Goats Machine Constructing Co. Ltd., the Ynagcheng Evening News Group; Guangzhou Five Goats Cosmetics Co. Ltd., as well as the local brand Five Goat Ice-cream, Five Goat Bicycle, etc. In 1925 and 1989, the government of Chuangzhou city had called for Guangzhou city's emblem twice. The first one was published in 1926. In the middle, it was the flag of the Republic of China, which was surrounded by five goats, and the around were wheat. The second one was published in 1990, in the middle, it is a five-pointed star, underneath is an artistic Chinese seal character‚Äî‚ÄúÁæä‚Äù and a gold key formed by wheat. But this emblem also was abandoned in 1997. However, these two versions of emblems had also contained the images of the five goats and wheat, from which we can see how important they are for Guangzhou people. In 1936, the government of the Republic of China had also issued a kind of Yixian Bronze coin (now called ‚ÄúGuangdong Five Goats Bronze Coin‚Äù). In the front of the coin, a hole surrounded by petals in the middle, above was the date that this coin was made, and underneath the hole was the image of the five goats. In the reverse side of the coin, in the middle was the same hole, but was surrounded by five seal ‚ÄúYang‚Äù characters. The outer sides were surrounded by a stem of wheat and on the other side curved ‚ÄúYixian‚Äù, namely, the value of the coin. In the symbolic meanings of Guangzhou Metro, it also contains ram's horn to indicate ‚ÄúYang‚Äù. In 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, both the emblem and mascot contains five goats‚Äô elements. The emblem of Asian Games was a fire symbol which was similar to the Five Goats Statue in Yuexiu Park, and the mascot was five goats.

History  The first station opened was as Sherburn in 1837 by the Durham & Sunderland Railway. It served as the temporary terminus of their line from Sunderland Town Moor until the line reached its intended terminus at Shincliffe Town station in Shincliffe on 28 June 1839. The station was renamed Sherburn House on 1 April to avoid confusion with another Sherburn station which was renamed on the same day. On 24 April 1893, the North Eastern Railway (by then the owners of the Durham to Sunderland line) opened a line from the original Sherburn House station to a new terminus at which was much closer to Durham City than the original D&SR; terminus in Shincliffe and as a consequence the line to Shincliffe Town was closed. At the same time as the opening of the line to Durham Elvet, the original station at Sherburn House was replaced by a new station on the Elvet branch. The second station was situated on the west side of the A181. The passenger service to Elvet was unsuccessful, thus regular passenger services were withdrawn on 1 January 1931.

It has a native range which covers the north-western Indian Ocean and it has been invaded the Mediterranean Sea by Lessepsian migration through the Suez Canal. Description Charybdis longicollis has a convex, hexagonal carapace which is covered with both dense and thin hairs. It is marked with granulated transverse lines in the frontal, protogastric, mesogastric and gill regions. The frontal margin is divided into six teeth, sharpest on the outside. The latero-anterior margin has six teeth, the first four of which are square and separated by deep incisions with serrated outer edges. The posterior teeth are twice as wide as the other teeth and have a lanceolate shape. The basal antennal article is expanded, with 5-8 granules. It has highly developed, robust chelipeds and are thinly coated with hair, granulated, show a carpus spine on the inner margin and three small lumps on the distal portion. The dorsal surface of the claw has an inner surface equipped with two pins and an external surface with a squaliform granule; further squaliform granule is located on the proximal carpal joint. The ventral surface is scaly. The posterior margin of the merus of the fifth pereopod has a strong subdistal spine. The posterior margin of the pleopods are denticulate, with an oval dactyl. The colour of the carapace is greenish- brown except for the margins and embossed granules which are paler in colour while the interior margins of the limbs are mustard coloured. The pereopods are brownish-grey with bluish-purple margins. The carapace length is from 2.5 to 3 cm. Distribution Charybdis longicollis is found in the north western Indian Ocean in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. It was first recorded in the Mediterraean off south eastern Turkey at two sites in April and May 1959 and was already found in some numbers. Subsequently, examination of specimens in museums showed that the species had become established in Turkish waters some time prior to its identification in 1959. It was recorded off Israel for the first time in 1961 where it was so abundant that it had become a pest to local fishermen by fouling their nets. It was recorded from the Mediterranean coasts of Egypt soon after and by 1972 was one of the most abundant species of crab on the south-eastern Mediterranean and has expanded as far as Greece. Biology Charybdis longicollis is found commonly at all depths between 8m and 200m over muddy or fine sandy substrates. It is a benthophagic species which prefers to feed on slow moving or stationary prey such as molluscs, crustacean and fish, the ingestion of microplastic beads has also been noted. Off the coast of Israel C. longicollis is very abundant and can make up to 70% of the total biomass in suitable habitat. However, in 1992 the Rhizocephalan parasitic barnacle Heterosaccus dollfusi was found to be infecting a few crabs collected off Israel and within three years the infection had spread to Turkey. In 1995 77% of the crabs collected in Haifa Bay were infected. This rapid increase and high infection rate is attributed to the extremely high population density of the host and the year round reproduction of the parasite. Despite very high rates of infection the population has not declined as expected and it has been suggested that the depletion of rays in these waters may have led to a severe reduction in predation pressure on the crabs which combined with the high fecundity shown by the pool of uninfected crabs enables the high populations to be maintained.

Her interactive time-based investigations, participatory projects, and video installations have been said to \\"create a poetic space for human connections.\\" Early life Cyrous was born in Tehran and obtained her BA degree in Visual Art Studies from the University of Science and Culture in Tehran. She lived in Iran until the Iranian Green Movement, when political tensions made her decide to move to the United States in 2011. She settled in San Francisco, where she graduated with a Master of Fine Arts Social Practice from the California College of Arts (CCA) in 2017. Immediately after graduating, Cyrous became a fellow at Escuela de Arte √ötil, managed by Tania Bruguera. Career Together with the Iranian artist Keyvan Shovir, she put up the mural In Memory Of in Clarion Alley in 2015. The mural depicts three famous Iranian women writers - Simin Daneshvar, Simin Behbahani, and Forough Farrokhzad. Cyrous and Shovir had already created another work there, portraying writers and artists imprisoned in Iran, and Cyrous installed her Lost Rug Project in Clarion Alley. Cyrous co-curated Inside Out Iran, an exhibition of Iranian urban art in London in 2015. She was the executive producer of Mutiny of Colours, a feature-length documentary film about street art and graffiti in Iran. She curated the video exhibition Eleven and a Half Hours in Oakland in 2017, displaying the works of the Iranian artist Shirin Abedinirad and the American artist Dionne Lee. Cyrous combined the two with the intention of \\"blurring lines between the two cultures... making Iran and Oakland feel like the same place.\\" She chose that title because eleven and a half hours is the time difference between San Francisco and Tehran. Her own work A Window to Tehran, with a video diptych synchronizing the San Francisco sunrise with the Tehran sunset, was based on the same idea.

He currently serves as chief innovations officer, professor and vice president of cancer services at the John Theurer Cancer Center, part of the Hackensack University Medical Center.  Early life and education  Pecora was born in 1957 in Newark, New Jersey. He was raised in nearby Nutley and graduated from Nutley High School.2005 Hall of Fame Inductee, Andrew L. Pecora, Nutley Hall of Fame. Accessed November 9, 2019. \\"Born and raised in Nutley, Dr. Pecora, a Nutley High School graduate, earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in biology and was graduated Magna Cum Laude from Seton Hall University in 1979.\\" Pecora attended Seton Hall University, graduating in 1979 with Bachelor of Science in Biology. He then attended the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ), graduating with a medical degree in 1983. He is a diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine's sub-specialties of hematology and oncology.  Medical career  Pecora interned at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center from 1983 to 1984 and was a resident in internal medicine from 1984 to 1986. From 1986 to 1989, he began a fellowship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He then moved to Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC) to become assistant director of stem cell and bone marrow transplantation from 1990 to 1993. He went on to become the program's chief director and the director of stem cell collection and storage services. Pecora has later served as the John Theurer Cancer Center's chairman, chief innovations officer, and vice president during his career at the hospital. In 1995, Hackensack was part of a large clinical study sponsored by National Cancer Institute to study the use of bone marrow transplantation to treat women with advanced breast cancer. He expressed his misgivings about only offering the procedure as part of the study as there was a chance the patients would be chosen to be a part of the control group. He instead offered direct access to the popular new procedure as an alternative to participation in the trial, allowing the patients to choose. The procedure was later proven ineffective. In 1998, Pecora started a version of the problem-based learning program at UMDNJ. An adaptation of earlier programs that allows medical students to fulfill their early basic science course requirements by examining the actual case studies. That same year, Pecora was the lead author on the study of CD34+CD33‚àí cells as it relates to chemotherapy treatment and bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Pecora et al. discovered that patients who had received more than two cycles of chemotherapy and were shown to have \\"chemotherapy-resistant NHL mobilized a significantly lower percentage of CD34+CD33‚àí cells than did chemotherapy-sensitive NHL patients.\\" They also found the reverse that those who had received less significant levels of chemotherapy treatment had higher levels of CD34+CD33‚àí cells. In 2002, Pecora was an investigator in a study of PV701, a virus that selectively attacks cancer cells. In the Phases 1 clinical trial, they found that intravenous administration of the oncolytic viruses led to inflammation of the tumor site that made it difficult to immediately determine effectiveness of the treatment. This false appearance of increase in cancer cells was confirmed by a later trial of the same oncolytic virus and also in Onyx 015, an oncolytic adenovirus. In describing the report authored by Pecora, Emily Bergsland and Alan Venook editorialized that The study concludes that PV701 could be tested relatively safely and offers dosing guidelines to mitigate side effects. However, the study raised more questions, moving \\"the field forward, even if very slowly.\\" In 2009, The Record named Pecora among Hackensack's administration with conflicts-of-interest, as they had ownership interests in companies with business dealings with the hospital. In 2011, Pecora founded Cota Healthcare, a company to develop a classification system based on patient's \\"gender, age, family history, type and stage of disease, and treatments.\\"  Notable publications    References   Sources   *  External links  * at John Theurer Cancer Center * Testimony to the Congressional Government Reform Committee on C-SPAN 1957 births Living people American oncologists American hematologists Nutley High School alumni People from Nutley, New Jersey Physicians from Newark, New Jersey Seton Hall University alumni University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey alumni ","title":"Andrew Pecora"},{"id":"53649869","text":"Yƒ±lmaz B√ºy√ºker≈üen Wax Museum, also known as Eski≈üehir Wax Museum, () is a wax museum in Odunpazarƒ± second level municipality in Greater Eski≈üehir, Turkey.

He also played in Australia and in English non-league football before becoming a football agent. Life and career Halliday was born in Sunderland. He began his football career with Newcastle United when he left school, and made his first-team debut on 25 October 1980 in a 6‚Äì0 defeat away to Chelsea in the Second Division. His first and what proved to be only goal for Newcastle was the only goal of the home match against Chelsea that same season. He was a first-team regular in the second half of the 1980‚Äì81 season and the first half of the next, but made only two appearances thereafter, both in May 1982. He spent time on loan at Fourth Division clubs Darlington and Bury, and joined the latter on a permanent basis in December 1982. He moved on again, to Bristol City, ahead of the 1983‚Äì84 season, and contributed to their winning the Fourth Division title. In 1985, he joined another Fourth Division club, Hereford United, making 83 appearances in all competitions over two seasons. He then moved into non-league football, signing on a free transfer for Bath City of the Football Conference. The team were relegated to the Southern League Premier Division at the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season, but Halliday's performances, playing in midfield rather than his customary central defensive position, earned him the captaincy for his second season. He made 69 appearances in all competitions, scoring once, before leaving in mid-season for Australia. Halliday played two National Soccer League campaigns for APIA Leichhardt, making 39 appearances without scoring, and captained the team. He then returned to English non-league football with Gateshead of the Conference and Dunston Federation Brewery of the Northern League. His five goals for Dunston included a hat-trick in a 7‚Äì0 win against Peterlee. He was briefly assistant manager to Peter Harrison at Blyth Spartans, before becoming a football agent. He also worked in the financial services industry.

Ellsworth House is a historic house at 316 Palisado Avenue in Windsor, Connecticut. It was built in 1872 for one of Windsor's leading citizens, and is a fine example of Italianate architecture executed in brick. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Horace H. Ellsworth House is located north of the village center of Windsor, on the east side of Palisado Avenue (Connecticut Route 159), a short way north of its junction with Old Kennedy Road. Palisado Avenue is a historically old road, once serving as the principal route paralleling the west bank of the Connecticut River. The house is a two-story brick structure, covered by a flat roof with a projecting cornice. Its main block is three bays wide and two deep, with windows set in rectangular openings with stone lintels and sills. A single-story porch extends across the front, continuing on the left (north) end to a corner gazebo-like pavilion. The main entrance is on the left side. A two-story ell projects to the rear, continued with a single-story ell beyond. The house was built in 1872 for Horace H. Ellsworth, and is distinctive locally for its Italianate style in brick, which contrasts with surrounding older buildings. Its first resident was Ellsworth's father, with Ellsworth and his family moving in after his father died. The house remained in the family until 1955. Horace Ellsworth was a local business owner, serving as director of a local cannery, and with interests in a commercial building and lumber business.

His research interests include Homer, Herodotus, Greek lyric, tragedy and comedy, Virgil, Greek mythology, structuralism, narratology, and other theories of literature. Biography After attending St Peter's School, York, Bowie studied for his undergraduate and graduate degrees at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge, under the academic supervision of P. E. Easterling. He was employed as a Lecturer from 1976 at the Greek Department of the University of Liverpool for five years. He received his PhD in 1979 and moved to Queen's College, Oxford, in 1981. In 1987 he taught a semester at Berkeley. Apart from Lobel Fellow and Tutor in Classics (from Praelector to Associate Professor), he also served as Senior Tutor (1981‚Äì1987) and Fellow Librarian at The Queen's College, as Chair of the Faculty of Classics (2011‚Äì2014), and as Assessor of the University of Oxford for a year. An international conference on Greek comedy in honour of Bowie took place in May 2017. His younger brother, Andrew, is an academic philosopher. On 4 May 2018, he delivered a eulogy at the funeral of his long-time partner, Peter Bayley, onetime Drapers Professor of French at the University of Cambridge.  Contributions  Bowie's first book (based on his doctoral thesis) addressed the relationship between the language of the Lesbian poets, Homer, and spoken Aeolic. He showed that the language of Sappho and Alcaeus was a true poetic diction, the traditions of which stem form a poetic Koine, and that the origins of this Koine are presumably to be sought back in the Mycenaean period at least. His most influential book has been Aristophanes: Myth, Ritual and Comedy (1993; reprinted in 1994, 1995, 1996, 2005; and translated into Modern Greek in 1999),Modern Greek edition: in which he traces patterns from mythology, rituals, and rites of passage in the extant Aristophanic comedies (usually found in a reversed form than expected). In a decade when structuralism was seen as outdated and restrictive by classicists, and deconstruction was becoming more and more popular, this book contributed to a positive re-evaluation of structuralist approaches to literature. Later (and contemporary) scholarship in the field has confirmed that \\"Future studies of myth and ritual in Aristophanes and other poets of Old Comedy, will surely be indebted to Bowie's important first steps\\".. According to , the 1996 edition alone is cited by 369 (as in May 2017). Bowie's Cambridge commentary on Herodotus is \\"particularly strong and up to date in its synthesis of historical and literary observations. In this sense his work outshines earlier, unsatisfactory English commentaries on Book 8\\". As for Odyssey XIII-XIV, also in the Cambridge 'green and yellow' series, \\"the text is Bowie's own, though he has not consulted the MSS. It is provided with a spare apparatus criticus. The bibliography is abundant and modern. The notes that accompany the commentary are exemplary. Bowie gives just the right amount of information, whether it is on the history of the word, or its usage, or background of a custom. Every so often he intersperses a prose summary of the text coming up, marvels of compression and lucidity.\\"  Monographs and edited volumes  * (1981) The Poetic Dialect of Sappho and Alcaeus (New York)..  * (1993) Aristophanes: Myth, Ritual, and Comedy (Cambridge; New York).

The term \\"health and care\\" (or \\"health / care\\") covers healthcare (medical care), public health, and social care. The purpose is to align research more closely with patients' and the public‚Äôs needs, skills and experience and thereby increase success and cost-effectiveness. PI is the proper term https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U-IJNJCfFepaAOruEhzz1TdLvAcHTt2Q/view/ for the involvement in research of anyone not professionally interested or experienced in health and care. (People with a professional background have plenty of chance to engage in such research.) Still sometimes used is PPI, patients and public involvement. The bodies concerned, NIHR and INVOLVE (see below) have used PI rather than PPI since 2017, most notably in the UK Standards for Public Involvement cited above (2019 version, first published in 2017, accessed 15 May 2020).  Origins and funding  Public involvement in UK health and care research is the last active remnant of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002 (Part 1, Section 5). The Act set up a Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health with a remit to move towards lay people's involvement in all aspects of health and care. The Commission had no funding, however, and closed in 2008. The Commission was replaced with a structure of 151 'Local involvement networks'; these had good funding and much the same aims - but were themselves abolished in 2013, as noted in the wiki article just linked. The UK's major funder of health and care research is the state-funded National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) - the research arm of the National Health Service. There are corresponding but subordinate organisations in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland (all accessed 15 May 2020). NIHR claims to ‚Äú[involve] patients and the public in all our work‚Äù. In the context of public involvement, however, as important is an offshoot of NIHR called 'INVOLVE', set up in 1996 and separated from NIHR in 2020. One of the aims of this advisory body is ‚Äúto support active public involvement in NHS, public health and social care research‚Äù. A number of key British medical bodies, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Medical Research Council, have adopted formal policies for public involvement. The mention of the UK's National Health Service has led to uncertainty whether or not there need be public involvement other than in state-funded health and care research. However, by 2020, a number of privately funded studies had started to have PI, some co-funded with NIHR and some with a charity. By 2017 most charities involved in UK health and care research had active public involvement staff and committees, with hundreds or even thousands of PI volunteers. For instance, Parkinson's UK says \\"Everything we do [in research] is driven by people affected by Parkinson's.\\" The larger charities in particular have increasing interest in public involvement with commercial research. Even so, as yet (2020) there is meaningful (and, therefore, effective) public involvement in only a small proportion of health and care research. That's mainly because, however much good will there may be, PI is still very new and uncoordinated, and any organisation wanting to take it on properly needs a large number of volunteers, as implied above. Other relevant public sector health / care research organisations in the UK are: * The regulatory Health Research Authority (HRA), whose home page says \\"we involve patients and the public in [our] work to improve health research design, delivery and regulation.\\" * The Medical Research Council (MRC), which has an Ethics regulation and public involvement committee. Also, despite NIHR‚Äôs example and INVOLVE‚Äôs support, there are many different models of public involvement in health and care research. Increasingly, public involvement in research is expected and even demanded by those funding it. However, as yet (2020), not all funders even ask researchers applying for support to say what PI they've had and how much they plan. Effective PI is anticipated at all stages, from initial twinkles in researchers' eyes to the final dissemination of outcomes. =The 'patient' in PI = The word ‚Äúpatient‚Äù appears explicitly in PPI, and remains implicit in PI. This is because it is known that involving people in research about a specific health condition or care situation who have (or have had) direct first-hand experience will demonstrably improve that research. Therefore, ‚Äúpatients‚Äù has come to mean: patients and ex-patients, as well as their carers, ex-carers and relatives; all are members of the public. =The 'public' in PI= As well as \\"patients\\" as above, public here is those lay people who do not necessarily have any direct stake in the research itself, but may have a particular interest in the outcomes of that research or who volunteer in the health and/or care research sectors. Professionals such as doctors, nurses, care-home staff and medical researchers have plenty of opportunity to be involved in research so are explicitly excluded from public involvement in this context. However, such professionals who also have lived experience of a given condition may be able to offer valuable public involvement. INVOLVE plans to publish guidance on this thorny problem in 2020, though it started working on it in 2016.... The charity Parkinson‚Äôs UK has a national Involvement Steering Group and a number of regional ones. One of the members‚Äô roles is to ‚Äúlook for opportunities to raise the profile of Parkinson‚Äôs UK as leaders in involvement‚Äù.  Levels of involvement  The involvement triangle Members of the public can have a role in health / care research in three broad levels. (This classification follows the eight-rung ladder of citizen participation.) * Participation - the most common level, where research happens one-way on or to people (eg as patients or controls). Participation in research appears as the broad base of the triangle shown. This is because most people with a role in health or care research are participants. * Engagement - where researchers communicate and describe their work to the public. This can happen in many ways. For instance, if research is not yet complete, a research team may describe their thinking, progress and interim findings. If research is complete, the team may report to a public audience or disseminate findings by press release. Even plays have been put on to explain serious medical issues to lay audiences. * Involvement - where members of the public have an active role and close contact with the research team. INVOLVE says ‚Äúpublic involvement in research [is] research being carried out ‚Äòwith‚Äô or ‚Äòby‚Äô members of the public rather than ‚Äòto‚Äô, ‚Äòabout‚Äô or ‚Äòfor‚Äô them.‚Äù There may be hundreds of volunteers in an involvement group or network, with several central full-time staff and / or volunteers working to make them an effective team. For instance, the Alzheimer's Society Research Network (founded over twenty years ago, in 1999) has several hundred volunteer members and two staff facilitators; the website lists some fifteen roles for the PI members. The Society spends over ¬£10 million a year on funding research; the Network costs perhaps a quarter of a million pounds a year (though there is some commercial sponsorship)  Reporting  Despite the increased demand for public involvement in health and care research, concerns have been expressed at the variable quality of feedback coming from that involvement. In 2017 new guidance was provided in an attempt to address this issue. At around the same time, NIHR published the first draft of the PI standards mentioned at the start of this article. One of the six standards concerns getting to know the impact of public involvement: \\"To drive improvement, we capture and share the difference that public involvement makes to research.\\" (That is from the 2018 version; the final, 2019, version is somewhat less clear: \\"Seek improvement by identifying and sharing the difference that public involvement makes to research.\\") Ref 20 above has much to say about this - impact is coming to be an important aspect of PI reporting. Impact relates to PI effectiveness (quality) of course. Indeed, it can lead to cost-effectiveness, important as PI can cost as much as 10% of some research budgets. Knowledge of PI impact has several levels - * recognising that PI makes a positive difference in specific ways; * assessing the difference caused by PI (mainly qualitatively, but in some cases semi-quantitatively); * measuring the difference so we can indeed get a grip on the effectiveness of PI in a given context. Of course, it's not possible actually to \\"measure\\" PI impact, ie the difference it makes. This is because it is not possible to compare a study with PI with exactly the same study without. PI impact \\"capture\\" covers just levels 1 and 2 above; however, it is still important. An overview of the subject of PI impact came from UK's Alzheimer's Society at the start of 2018.  Involvement in the research cycle  Apart from cost, there are few reasons why all stages of health and care research should not involve the public. NIHR‚Äôs PPI Framework 2015-2018 states: ‚ÄúWe ensure that processes are in place to involve the public in all stages of the research we fund and manage ‚Ä¶ guaranteeing the involvement of patients, carers and members of the public at all points in the research process.‚Äù In any event, effective PI can lead to more effective research and that should save money, much by cutting waste. (This includes the huge cost of failed research and studies not completed.) Broadly speaking, research ‚Äì of any kind, not just for health or care ‚Äì is problem-solving. Once a problem is precisely defined, solving it uses the problem-solving cycle. The research cycle shown is the same as that. (Scientific method has much more detail.) Research = problem-solving Needs analysis (or problem analysis) is that first stage of defining precisely the problem to be researched: the research question. The next stage ‚Äì which can take months ‚Äì is to define precisely the apparently best and most appropriate solution: the research method. Only after this can the research team apply for funding. Implementation is the main part of the cycle ‚Äì carrying out the research and analysing the results. This may take a couple of years. When that is over, the research team should evaluate the outcomes. This means checking with care that they have solved the problem, ie answered the research question asked. There can be many reasons for failing at this stage. In scientific research (science) and inventing (technology), the people concerned go round and round the cycle until they succeed. In other words, they return to needs analysis to tweak the research question, then to solution analysis to tweak the research method, and so on. One of the problems with much of health and care research is that the study runs out of funded time so evaluation can be hasty, and re- cycling is left out. The team leaves the cycle top left and goes on to the stages of reporting and disseminating. Or not, if the study failed to meet its objectives (or even came up with the \\"wrong\\" answers). There are many causes of research failure.... Main types of PI activity One of the benefits of public involvement is to help the research team understand lay people's needs and perspectives and ensure that research is relevant and acceptable to them. This can reduce the chance of failure and make the research more effective and more cost-effective. A recent study of Parkinson's UK public involvement made those points clearly.

Together they travelled the State by horse and cart hawking softgoods (soft goods being cloth and articles made from it), and were successful enough to start a small drapery business in Kermode Street, North Adelaide. They each married a sister of the other. In 1850 John Good & Co. began trading as drapers in Rundle Street, Adelaide, opposite Berry's China Warehouse. In January 1853 he opened a general store opposite Low's Inn, Mount Barker, followed by a grain store which in 1864 he sold to William Barker, previously a partner of Sidney George Wilcox's brothers Joseph and Emery in Gawler. Good, Toms & Co. warehouse, Stephens Place In 1872 Good and Samuel Toms founded the wholesale firm of Good, Toms & Co. on King William Street, later office on Wyatt Street and a warehouse at 22 Stephens Place. The business ceased trading in the early 1930s. In 1932 the warehouse was purchased by Charles Birks & Co and around 1934 incorporated into their adjacent retail establishment.

Originally a vaudeville vocalist, Turner recorded 10 songs in 1921 and 1922, making her one of the first female blues singers to be recorded. Details of her life outside the recording studio are minimal. Biography Turner was born in Virginia, to parents from Virginia, around 1888. She was living in New York City, making her living as a performer, by 1920.1920 United States Federal Census Her first recordings, almost certainly in March 1921, were of \\"How Many Times?\\" and \\"Can't Get Lovin' Blues\\", with piano accompaniment, possibly by Willie Gant. It is thought that Clarence Williams played the piano on two of her other recordings. Gus Aiken (trumpet) was also credited on recording sessions with Turner in 1921. Turner was thus one of the first black women to sing blues on recordings, which were made in New York. However, also in 1921, other blues singers, such as Lillyn Brown, Lucille Hegamin, and Daisy Martin, all made records. Six of Turner's sides, including \\"When the Rain Turns into Snow (Who's Gonna Keep You Warm)\\" and \\"Who'll Drive Your Blues Away\\", were with piano accompaniment by James P. Johnson. They were originally issued on both Path√© Actuelle Records and Perfect Records. At least two of her tracks were issued by Okeh Records. Two of the songs that Turner recorded, \\"Watch Me Go\\" and \\"He Took It Away from Me\\", were written by Roy Turk and J. Russel Robinson. Turner's brief recording career finished in October 1922. In 1930, she was living as a widow in New York, and may be the person of that name who made a Social Security application in 1937. Her work has appeared on various compilation albums, including Female Blues 1921‚Äì1928 (Document Records, 1997), which includes \\"When the Rain Turns into Snow (Who's Gonna Keep You Warm)\\" and \\"Who'll Drive Your Blues Away\\". In 1994, Document Records issued an anthology incorporating all of her known recorded work, together with the later recordings of Virginia Liston.

New Hampshire voted for the Republican nominee, incumbent President Herbert Hoover of California, over the Democratic nominee, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York. Hoover's running mate was incumbent Vice President Charles Curtis of Kansas, while Roosevelt ran with incumbent Speaker of the House John Nance Garner of Texas.

Plot After the old ferryman of a small village dies while transporting The Stranger, a homeless woman arrives and takes over his duties. The next evening, a wounded man appears and asks to be ferried across. She does more, hiding him from pursuers and nursing him back to health. Gradually, she falls in love. But he was not meant to live, and soon The Stranger appears on the shore. This is, she quickly realizes, Death itself, and she refuses to conduct him across. The drifter, Mary, instead seeks to outwit the Grim Reaper when he then appears in the village. She hides in, naturally, a church, before leading him into the marsh she now knows. He sinks while she knows where solid ground is.

Though Joseph Goebbels, Propaganda Minister for the Third Reich, dismissed it as \\"an experiment, but not a good one\\", the film still received an award for artistic value.Hans- J√ºrgen Tast ‚ÄûF√§hrmann Maria‚Äú.

Life Willoughby left England for South Africa in 1871 to seek his fortune. In the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 he fought with the Natal African troops, and was in command of their mounted corps. He then for a time acted as auctioneer's assistant, subsequently becoming partner in the firm of Willoughby & Scoones at Maritzburg, where he resided. After a short period with a theatrical company, he raised and commanded an irregular troop, \\"Willoughby's Horse\\", which saw service in the Basuto Gun War of 1880. In January 1884 Willoughby went to Madagascar, where, gaining the confidence of the Queen Ranavalona III and her husband Rainilaiarivony, the prime minister, he was appointed on 18 May general commander of the Hovas, the kingdom's armed forces (18 May). On the outbreak of the First Franco-Hova War next year he assembled and drilled an army of 20,000 soldiers. The Hovas, however, were heavily defeated. At the close of the war in December 1885 Willoughby helped in negotiations with the French government, and went to London charged as plenipotentiary with a mission on behalf of the Malagasy government. Although he was well received, the British authorities did not recognise him, a British subject, as an envoy. The mission involved the negotiation of a loan; but when Willoughby returned to Madagascar, belatedly, he was charged with the misuse of funds, and expelled from the country.Phares M. Mutibwa, Trade and economic development in nineteenth century Madagascar, Transafrican Journal of History Vol. 2, No. 1 (January 1972), pp. 32‚Äì63. Published by: Gideon Were Publications. Wearing the uniform of a British field-marshal, Willoughby ran a military spectacle at the Chicago Exhibition of 1893. In October of the same year, after the outbreak of the First Matabele War, went to Rhodesia. The war was almost over, but on the journey from Kimberley, he conferred with Cecil Rhodes, and reached Bulawayo just before the end of the campaign. He then assisted in the administration of Rhodesia. In 1894 Willoughby was again in London, lecturing on the Matabele war. On the outbreak of the Second Matabele war in March 1896, he formed part of a council of defence at Bulawayo, under the acting administrator of Rhodesia. He revisited South Africa on the outbreak of the war there in 1899, but took no part in the fighting, and soon returned to England. Willoughby, who had made a wealthy second marriage, was then ruined in health, and had lost an eye. He died at Goring-on-Thames on 3 June 1901. He was a vivid raconteur of his experiences.

Sharath Jois (born Rangaswamy Sharath on 29 September 1971) is a teacher, practitioner and lineage holder (paramaguru) of Ashtanga Yoga, in the tradition of his grandfather K. Pattabhi Jois. He is the director of the K. Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute (KPJAYI) in Mysore, India. Early life Jois was born on 29 September 1971 in Mysore India to Saraswati Rangaswamy, daughter of K. Pattabhi Jois. Jois was born into a family dedicated to the practice, preservation and teaching of Ashtanga yoga as his grandfather had learned from his teacher, T. Krishnamacharya. Jois, being exposed to yoga since birth, began practicing asanas informally around seven years old and continued non-committally until age 14. At the age of 19, he began formal study of the Ashtanga yoga system with his grandfather and is the lineage holder of Ashtanga yoga today. Jois' grandfather, K. Pattabhi Jois, began studying yoga with T. Krishnamacharya at the age of 12, in 1927, and continued his formal study with his teacher until 1954. Pattabhi Jois spent more than 70 years of his life dedicated to practicing and teaching Ashtanga yoga. He established the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute, his first yoga school, in his home in Lakshmipuram in 1948. To accommodate the increasing number of students coming to study, he opened a new school in Gokulam in 2002. Jois was beset by many illnesses when he was a child, suffering a year in bed from glandular fever at age four, to a broken leg and rheumatic fever at age seven. At school, he earned a diploma in electronics from JSS in Mysore. He learned his first asanas at age seven. His grandfather used to say that young children could play with postures from the primary and intermediate series, as many of them are easy for children to do. Yoga teacher When he was 19 years old, his mother told him that he should begin assisting his grandfather in the yoga shala, as there were many students, and his grandfather was not a young man anymore. From that time, he became Pattabhi Jois's full-time assistant. It was during these years that Sharath's devotion to the practice deepened and he began to intuit its transformative power. Jois studied the experiential as well as the theoretical aspects of yoga with his grandfather for quite some time before he felt that he was ready to guide others through the method. Sharath notes that it is important for a practitioner to understand the asana and the associated vinyasa before teaching others. He spent countless hours observing his grandfather teach, working with students of various body types, and developing a sense of how to work with individual differences. As a teacher, Jois reinforces the idea that Ashtanga yoga is a process and that asanas are simply one aspect of the practice, preparing individuals to incorporate the other limbs into their lives. There are many layers to the practice and although it may appear as a linear practice, marked by progression based on the addition of new asanas, it is in fact much more nuanced. This is why students are encouraged to focus on the physical practice because the experiential aspects of the practice are where the true learning occurs, not simply by reading about yoga theory; the practice is the foundation for the practical application of yoga theory. He studied under his grandfather for twenty years. Jois began traveling internationally with his grandfather in the 1990s to teach Ashtanga yoga. They felt it was imperative to travel and teach an authentic system of yoga in the West where yoga was becoming increasingly popular and being taught in non-traditional ways. In efforts to maintain the integrity and tradition of the practice, he continues to travel and teach worldwide. Director of yoga institute In 2007 when Pattabhi Jois was not in good health and unable to teach any longer, Sharath became director of the Institute. He has steadily grown into his role as director of KPJAYI and as the seniormost authority on the practice, having studied and practiced all six series with his grandfather. His style of teaching and presence in the shala has been described by a senior student as a balance of strictness and compassion. In attempts to continue the yoga lineage, he holds a teachers' course in the summer for authorized and certified practitioners to ensure the Ashtanga method is being taught in the spirit of the tradition and with respect to the lineage of yoga gurus who have kept the practice alive - Rama Mohan Bramachari, T. Krishnamacharya, and his grandfather. Jois was honoured at a celebration thrown following the completion of one of the teacher's courses in 2014. During this course, Sharath reminded his students of the importance of teaching \\"from the heart\\". Following in the spirit of his late grandfather, Jois holds conferences on Saturdays after led classes to discuss important aspects of the practice, theory, and to address any questions or concerns that students may have concerning the practice. Jois reiterates, that to receive full benefits of the practice, one should practice intentionally with the 4 D's in mind - devotion, dedication, determination, and discipline. In 2019, Jois rebranded and renamed the K. Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute (KPJAYI) in Mysore as Sharath Yoga Centre. The same year, he publicly acknowledged his grandfather K. Pattabhi Jois's sexual abuse of pupils, apologising to the students who had experienced this trauma and encouraging them to forgive his grandfather. \\"It brings me immense pain that I also witnessed him giving improper adjustments\\", Sharath wrote. In Ashtanga Yoga Anusthana, Jois discusses asanas that may have therapeutic value.

Leene (5 September 1906 ‚Äì 28 October 1994) was a Dutch scientist who had an early career in zoology, specifically carcinology, was a science teacher and then a textile scientist. Her zoological work was highly regarded, especially her doctoral thesis on the swimming crabs of the genus Charybdis. Early career Leene was born in Amsterdam on 5 September 1906. She was educated in Amsterdam, going to Amsterdam University where she graduated in 1931 with a master's degree in zoology, specialising in comparative anatomy, studying the hearts of monitor lizards from the genus Varanus. She went on to study for a Ph.D. and she chose to study the taxonomy of crabs, probably under the influence of her teacher Professor J.E.W. Ihle who was working on the specimens collected by the Siboga expedition of 1899-1900. He allocated the swimming crabs, Portunidae, to Leene who attempted to write a monograph of the family and visited a number of museums in the Netherlands and abroad in the course of this work. Her thesis was published in 1930, proving to be a thorough treatment of the swimming crabs of the genus Charybdis and some other smaller genera of the family Portunidae, she hoped to complete a monograph of the family over subsequent years. Leene was awarded her doctoral degree cum laude on 22 June 1938 and her thesis is still considered as an important work for workers on the Portunidae. Teaching The economic situation in the 1930s meant that Leene could not continue her zoology career and to make ends meet she became a high school biology teacher, teaching at a number of schools in different towns in order to gate an income she could survive on. This left little time for her to continue her studies in carcinology. On 15 October 1939 she was appointed as a teacher of biology at a girls' school for technical education in Arnhem, while having another job teaching in Haarlem. When a teacher specialising in textile fibre research left Leene was asked to take that subject on too. She became interested and proficient in this subject ad in 1945 she was appointed as a curator in the Division of Fibre Technology in the Department of Mechanical Technology of Technische Hogeschool Delft (Delft Institute of Technology). Resumption of science career Her teaching work between 1938 and 1945 had left her little time for scientific research but she renewed her career, this time in the field of fibre technology. Leene was appointed a lecturer in fibre technology as Delft University and was later appointed a full professor, eventually retiring in 1971. Leene published a carcinological paper in 1949 in collaboration with Miss A.M. Buitendijk in which she described 3 new species. This was in a special edition of Bijdragen tot de Dierkunde to celebrate the 70th birthdays of Professor Ihle and another of her teachers, Professor L.f. de Beaufort who had been director of the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam. The paper was severely edited but the renowned carcinologist Lipke Holthuis found the full manuscript among Miss Buitendijk's papers following her death in 1950. With Leene's help he published the remainder of the paper in 1952. Retirement Leene retired from her position at the Delft University of Technology in 1971 and she retired to the town of Voorschoten where she lived in an apartment in a retirement home with a friend until her death in 1996 at the age of 88.

The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 2006.  Biography  Entrance to Maharshi Dayanand University Born in the north Indian state of Haryana, Virender S. Sangwan graduated in medicine from Maharshi Dayanand University in 1986 and completed his MS in ophthalmology in 1991. Subsequently, he did a fellowship at L. V. Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) on cornea and anterior segment surgery and during his stay there, Gullapalli Nageswara Rao, the founder of the institute, advised him about the opportunity to join Orbis International as an acting medical director at Orbis Flying Eye Hospital which he accepted. He held the position for over 18 months and left for another fellowship program on ocular immunology and uveitis at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, an associate of Harvard Medical School under the supervision of Charles Stephen Foster, who would later found the Massachusetts Eye Research and Surgery Institution. Returning to India, he re-joined LVPEI as a cornea specialist, became an associate director and a director and heads SRUJANA Centre for Innovation as well as the Center for Ocular Regeneration, a joint venture of LVPEI and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He holds the Dr.Paul Dubord Chair in Cornea at LVPEI and is as an adjunct associate professor at University of Rochester. Virender Sangwan is married to Vandana who is a dental surgeon and the couple has two children, Sonalika and Sahil.  Legacy  Anterior uveitis Sangwan has done extensive work on limbal stem cells which is reported to have assisted in restoring vision to patients with corneal injuries. Along with Geeta K. Vemuganti, an ophthalmologist with interest in limbal stem cell studies, he carried out research on the subject and together they developed a methodology for growing stem cells for subsequent transplantation in human eyes for repairing injured epithelium and cornea. This was subsequently put on clinical trial in 2011, reported to be the largest successful trial of stem cell therapy on humans, till then. Later, with the assistance of two philanthropists, they established Sudhakar and Sreekanth Ravi Stem Cell Biology Laboratory where he furthered his work. The methodology developed by him involved harvesting of cell tissues from the healthy eye of the patient and cultivation of the cell tissues on amniotic sac membrane which was then transplanted on the injured eye; he has done over 800 transplants at LVPEI, reportedly with 76% success rate. Later, he also developed a methodology for culturing conjunctival and limbal stem cells together which is known to have application in treating patients with extreme ocular damage of the outer surface. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles of which many have been listed by online article repositories such as Google Scholar and ResearchGate, and his work has drawn citations in texts by others. He has also served as an investigator in a number of clinical projects undertaken by Sudhakar and Sreekanth Ravi Stem Cell Biology Laboratory. Sangwan, having undergone two years' of training at Foster's laboratory on ocular immunology, had started his Indian career focusing on ocular inflammatory diseases such as Uveitis and his early work was in this field was as an uveitis and retina specialist at LVPEI. This gave him the opportunity to interact with the pioneers of uveitis treatment in India such as Narsing A. Rao, Amod Gupta, Rajeeve Buddi, Jyotirmay Biswas and S. R. Rathinam and when Rao inspired the others to form the Uveitis Society of India in 1999, he was among the founder members, serving as its founder secretary and treasurer, where he is a member of the advisory board of the society. He is involved with the Himalayan Vision Project, a joint venture between LV Prasad Eye Institute and Himalayan Health Project and has been associated with journals including Indian Journal of Ophthalmology, Comprehensive Ophthalmology Update, Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology, International Ophthalmology and British Journal of Ophthalmology. A vice president of the Asia Cornea Society, he is an honorary member of North African Centre for Sight and Visual Sciences as well as the national societies of ophthalmology of Peru and El Salvador. He sat in the international steering committees of Lux Uveitis Multicenter Investigation of a New Approach to Treatment (LUMINATE) trial and LUCIDA Program for Prevention of Corneal Transplant Rejection of Lux Biosciences and is a former secretary of Eye Bank Association of India. The invited speeches or keynote addresses delivered by him include a lecture on Cell-based Therapy for Ocular Reconstruction at the Louis J.

On 4 May 2013, he officiated his first Premiership game, taking charge of London Welsh and Worcester Warriors. Carley later became the first referee to gain promotion from the Referee Academy into a full-time referee. Three months into his first season at premiership level, Carley made his European debut taking charge of Cavalieri Prato home game against Lusitanos XV during the 2013‚Äì14 European Challenge Cup. In November 2014, Carley had his first taste of international rugby when he took charge of a RFU Championship XV against Canada. Several months later he officiated his first international, Portugal v Spain in the European Nations Cup. During the 2015/16 season, Carley became a regular referee at Premiership level and debuted in the European Rugby Champions Cup refereeing Munster against Benetton Treviso. That same season he took charge of a 2015‚Äì16 European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter final and the second leg of the 2015‚Äì16 RFU Championship final. He took charge of his first World Rugby appointed match, refereeing the United States against Russia in June 2016. In November 2016, he refereed his first Tier 1 nation, officiating Scotland's clash against Georgia. During the 2017 Six Nations Championship, he made his first Six Nations appearance, acting as assistant referee to John Lacey during Scotland's game against Wales and subsequently has taken charge of his first Tier 1 International Test match at Murrayfield Stadium refereeing Scotland Vs New Zealand on 18 November 2017.

Biography Very little is known about the life of Lodewijk van Velthem. He was said to be from Brabant, and from descriptions of what he witnessed we can deduce that he was active before 1293 and until at least 1327. He presumably lived in Paris between 1293 and 1296. In the winter of 1298, he was in Ghent. He was ordained a priest in or before 1304 as he worked as a chaplain in Zichem then. By 1312, he was the parish priest of Veltem, now a part of Herent; this is presumably the origin of his name. His earliest known writings date to this period, as the 4th part of the Spieghel Historiael was finished in 1315. Work After the death of Jacob van Maerlant, Van Velthem finished his most important work, the Spieghel historiael, writing the end of the 4th part and the complete 5th part. In 1326, he finished the Boec van Merline, an Arthurian poem.

Transition refers to a computer science paradigm in the context of communication systems which describes the change of communication mechanisms, i.e., functions of a communication system, in particular, service and protocol components. In a transition, communication mechanisms within a system are replaced by functionally comparable mechanisms with the aim to ensure the highest possible quality, e.g., as captured by the quality of service.  Idea and functional principle  Transitions and the subsequent adaptation of communication systems enable the optimization of the communication quality despite changing conditions. Transitions enable communication systems to adapt to changing conditions during runtime. This change in conditions can, for example, be a rapid increase in the load on a certain service that may be caused, e.g., by large gatherings of people with mobile devices. A transition often impacts multiple mechanisms at different communication layers of a layered architecture. Mechanisms are given as conceptual elements of a networked communication system and are linked to specific functional units, for example, as a service or protocol component. In some cases, a mechanism can also comprise an entire protocol. For example on the transmission layer, LTE can be regarded as such a mechanism. Following this definition, there exist numerous communication mechanisms that are partly equivalent in their basic functionality, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee for local wireless networks and UMTS and LTE for broadband wireless connections. For example, LTE and Wi-Fi have equivalent basic functionality, but they are technologically significantly different in their design and operation. Mechanisms affected by transitions are often components of a protocol or service. For example, in case of video streaming/transmission, the use of different video data encoding can be carried out depending on the available data transmission rate. These changes are controlled and implemented by transitions; A research example is a context-aware video adaptation service to support mobile video applications.S. Wilk, D. Stohr, and W. Effelsberg. 2016. A Content-Aware Video Adaptation Service to Support Mobile Video. ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. 12, 5s, Article 82 (November 2016) Through analyzing the current processes in a communication system, it is possible to determine which transitions need to be executed at which communication layer in order to meet the quality requirements. In order for communication systems to adapt to the respective framework conditions, architectural approaches of self-organizing, adaptive systems can be used, such as the MAPE cycle JO Kephart and DM Chess. The vision of autonomous computing. IEEE Computer, 1, pp. 41-50, 2003. (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute). This central concept of Autonomic Computing can be used to determine the state of the communication system, to analyze the monitoring data and to plan and execute the necessary transition(s). A central goal is that users do not consciously perceive a transition while running applications and that the functionality of the used services is perceived as smooth and fluid.  Recent research  The study of new and fundamental design methods, models and techniques that enable automated, coordinated and cross-layer transitions between functionally similar mechanisms within a communication system is the main goal of a collaborative research center funded by the German research foundation (DFG). The DFG collaborative research center 1053 MAKI - Multi- mechanism Adaptation for the future Internet - focuses on research questions in the following areas: (i) Fundamental research on transition methods, (ii) Techniques for adapting transition-capable communication systems on the basis of achieved and targeted quality, and (iii) specific and exemplary transitions in communication systems as regarded from different technical perspectives. A formalization of the concept of transitions that captures the features and relations within a communication system to express and optimize the decision making process that is associated with such a system is given in. The associated building blocks comprise (i) Dynamic Software Product Lines, (ii) Markov Decision Processes and (iii) Utility Design. While Dynamic Software Product Lines provide a method to concisely capture a large configuration space and to specify run time variability of adaptive systems, Markov Decision Processes provide a mathematical tool to define and plan transitions between available communication mechanisms. Finally, utility functions quantify the performance of individual configurations of the transition-based communication system and provide the means to optimize the performance in such a system. Applications of the idea of transitions have found their way to wireless sensor networks and mobile networks, distributed reactive programming, WiFi firmware modification, planning of autonomic computing systems, analysis of CDNs,Jeremias Blendin, Fabrice Bendfeldt, Ingmar Poese, Boris Koldehofe, and Oliver Hohlfeld. 2018.

History Glasdrum has been actively managed by people since at least the 17th century and probably from much earlier. The remains of charcoal platforms and a limekiln, which date from the 18th and 19th centuries provide evidence of industrial activity that required large quantities of wood. During this period Glasdrum was managed by coppicing, under a system by which scattered mature oak and ash trees and were left standing, with the intervening space used to allow oak and other underwood to be cut at 10-15 year intervals. Oak was the favoured species, due its strength, and the fact that bark could be used in the tanning process. Species such as birch, alder, willow and hazel were known as \\"black woods\\", which were often not considered worth protecting.The Story of Glasdrum Wood National Nature Reserve. p. 6. The woods at Loch Creran were acquired by the Forestry Commission in the 1950s and early 1960s. The commission enclosed part of Glasdrum Wood with a deer fence, and began to clear the deciduous woodland to plant conifer species. In 1962 the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), predecessor to NatureScot, leased a 17-ha area alongside the road to protect the native woodland. This land was purchased by the NCC and declared a national nature reserve in 1967. In 1976, the NCC purchased a further 152 ha of the adjoining land, which was declared an extension of the national nature reserve a year later.The Story of Glasdrum Wood National Nature Reserve. p. 8. All land in the Glasdrum Wood National Nature Reserve is now owned by NatureScot. Flora and fauna Glasdrum Wood NNR comprises ancient sessile oakwoods, interspersed with ash, birch and alder.

She gained worldwide fame after a live video of her in the late stages of pregnancy, along with the subsequent birth, were put on YouTube. The birth was watched live by nearly 1.2 million viewers. Life April was born in 2002 at the Catskill Game Farm in Catskill, New York. She resided at the Catskill Game Farm until it closed in October 2006, when she was relocated to Adirondack Animal Land in Broadalbin, New York. Animal Adventure Park owned by Jordan Patch acquired 13-year-old April shortly after acquiring Oliver, a much younger 3-year-old male giraffe, in 2015. Oliver and April soon mated, which resulted in her pregnancy that normally lasts 15 months. It was Oliver's first siring and April's fourth pregnancy; she had previously mothered three other giraffes, two males and a female named Autumn, with a male giraffe named Stretch. After becoming pregnant, at Animal Adventure Park she became a \\"viral sensation\\" in February 2017 while being monitored by a live stream. An estimated 1.2 million viewers watched the live feed of the giraffe giving birth on YouTube; the live feed was sponsored by Toys R Us and Babies R Us, as a play on that chain's mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe. By the time the camera was shut off, the YouTube feed had accumulated 232 million views. A GoFundMe fundraiser page that initially set a goal of $50,000 sat at more than $135,000 by the time the calf was born. The money is to be used to offset the annual care for the animals and upgrading the giraffe exhibit at the park. With the prolonged wait for April to enter labor, some people had questioned if the pregnancy was an April Fools' Day joke, and other conspiracy theories had also been put forward. Prior to the birth, April's veterinarian Dr Tim Slater stated that despite a great sense of anticipation, the birth of her calf was not considered overdue. On April 8, 2017, April's zookeeper Allysa Swilley and caretaker Corey Dwyer stated that April was big, full of milk and \\"closer\\" to giving birth, but at this time, the calf is \\"just not coming out.\\" A live stream of April's pregnancy has been posted to the video-sharing site YouTube. A minor controversy resulted when YouTube briefly removed the stream in late February 2017 following complaints from animal activists of the video allegedly violating standards in regards to nudity and sexual activity. Following thousands of complaints from YouTube users, the stream was restored to the website within an hour. On April 15, 2017, Animal Adventure Park announced April had gone into labor, noting that the calf's hooves had come out of the womb and that it would take between 30 minutes and two hours from that point to complete the birth. The calf, a male with a height of and weighing ,Vet Check and a Thumbs Up. Animal Adventure Park official Facebook feed. Retrieved April 17, 2017. was born at approximately 9:54 a.m. Eastern Time. The giraffe cam was shut off at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on April 21, with the staff appearing on camera before the shutoff to express their thanks. The calf was named Tajiri as a result of a name-the-baby contest, from the Swahili language word for \\"hope\\". On July 25, 2018, Animal Adventure Park announced that April and Oliver had conceived a second time earlier in the year. This calf, also a male, was born at 12:43 p.m. Eastern Time on March 16, 2019; as with Tajiri's birth, the birth was live-streamed on the Internet, with 300,000 viewers at the time of birth. On March 16, 2019, at 12:43 pm April gave birth to her fourth son, Azizi (Ah-Zee-Zee) weighing 139 pounds with a height of 5 feet and 11 inches. The calf was on his feet at 1:27 pm; and was observed nursing at 1:51 pm. April was placed on birth control in June 2019 and would enter senior care after her handlers observed behavior that made them believe that further calf bearing would be hazardous to her health. During her retirement, she will be housed with her two youngest children Tajiri and Azizi. Animal Adventure Park acquired another female giraffe, Johari, to continue breeding of the species with Oliver. On November 25th, 2019, it was announced that Azizi, April's youngest calf, will be moving to East Texas Zoo & Gator Park in Grand Saline, Texas, in spring 2020. The reason being that he is growing faster than older brother Tajiri, and also taking to alfalfa hay and fortified pelleted giraffe diet early on in his development.

Introduced in 1966 by Myers, McGinnis and Masnick, the most widely known form of the axiom is encapsulated by the statement: > \\"The probability of remaining in any state of nature increases as a strict > monotone function of duration of prior residence in that state.\\"Robert > McGinnis, \\"A Stochastic Model of Social Mobility\\", American Sociological > Review, 1968. Retrieved 31/03/2017. There is thus a clear negative correlation between the amount of time a person has lived in a certain location, and the likelihood they will move in future.Burton Singer and Seymour Spilerman, \\"Social Mobility Models for Heterogeneous Populations\\", Sociological Methodology, 1973-4. Retrieved 31/03/2017. Suggested reasons for this change include loss aversion (resulting from possible unknown problems in the further place of residence), financial stability linked to a certain place of employment or the presence of an extended social network in the form of familial and other obligations.Philip S. Morrison and W.A.V. Clark, \\"Why do they stay? Loss aversion and Duration of Residence\\" , California Center for Population Research, UCLA, 2015. Retrieved 31/03/2017. The large number of factors which affect human migratory patterns make it difficult to assess the exact degree of impact of the various postulated variables, and debate also exists as to the appropriate relation between residence time and likelihood of moving. Since it was first coined from human residence patterns, cumulative inertia has since been observed in a variety of other social behaviours. It has been used to model entry to and recovery from addiction, modern tribalism effects, and the rehabilitation chances of repeat offenders (recidivism). Identifying the role and strength of inertia in such behaviours can be critical in designing the appropriate treatment or intervention strategy, and is an important tool in identifying individuals or groups which are most likely to change behaviour. In addition to being relevant in specific demographic targeting, such as members of a political party who are more likely to be swayed by different ideology, or individuals who pose a higher risk of relapsing into additive behaviours, cumulative inertia can also play an important role outside of political campaigns or public policy making. Geographical areas presenting strong cumulative inertia are indicative of attractive regions wherein property prices or demand is likely to rise. Cumulative inertia can thus also have a strong financial impact. The study of cumulative inertia remains an active area of current research in complex systems or quantitative sociology.

They are all equipped with a (water)jet-propelled pursuit boat, that is deployed and retrieved via a stern launching ramp, enabling it to be used without bringing the cutter to a halt. Sea Devil, and the three other vessels, have been modified from the design of the Coast Guard's other Marine Protector cutters. These four vessels mount an additional gyro-stabilized remotely controlled machine gun. The main armament of the standard Marine Protector cutter are a pair of .50-caliber (12.7mm) Browning machine guns, mounted on the rail to either side of the vessel's foredeck. The long range accuracy of these weapons is low, when fired by a gunner on a pitching deck, aiming using \\"iron sights\\". Sea Devil, and the three other cutters, have a pedestal, in the middle of the foredeck, that gives their main armament a better field of fire. The gun mounted on the pedestal is the same Browning as the other guns, but gyro stabilization compensates for the pitching deck. The mount is equipped with multiple cameras, enabling the gun aimer on the bridge to focus the gun's sights on a distant target, even at night, or when visibility is impaired by smoke, or fog. To complete their missions these four ships carry a larger crew. Where a standard Marine Protector cutter deploys with a crew of ten, these vessels deploy with a crew of fifteen.

There are areas of seasonal forest east of √ìbidos that is dry in the summer and has a canopy under , with mesophyllous, semidecidous and xeromorphic flora. There are also some open meadows. In the west, Manaus may be a region where organisms that had separated and evolved independently during ice ages came back together in warmer periods. The forests to the north and east of Manaus are among the most diverse in the world, and include many endemic plants, animals and insects. To the north of Manaus there are as many as 235 species of trees in one hectare. Common tree species include Protium hebetatum, Eschweilera coriacea, Eschweilera wachenheimii, Manilkara bidentata, Rinorea guianensis, Pouteria engleri, Swartzia reticulata, Duckeodendron cestroides, and Qualea labouriauara. To the west of the Trombetas the forest typically has a canopy from with emergent trees reaching . The dense vegetation has many small-to-medium diameter trees, under wide. The most common families of trees are Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae, Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Rubiaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae, Annonaceae, Moraceae, Mimosoideae and Caesalpinioideae. The forests are more homogeneous in structure east of the Trombetas River, have but similar height and species. The Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and Dinizia excelsa are common, but do not reach the same size as elsewhere. The forests do not have large numbers of epiphytes. The acap√∫ (Vouacapoua americana) is an important timber tree that is endemic to the east of the ecoregion. The dry hills to the north of √ìbidos hold plants such as Zamia lecointei, Cynometra longifolia, Tachigalia grandiflora, Swartzia duckei, Ormosia cuneata, Peltogyne paradoxa, Cusparia trombetensis, Vochysia mapuerae, Bonnetia dinizii, Lacunaria sampaioi, Lophostoma dinizii, Ctenardisia speciosa, Mostuea brasiliensis, Macairea viscosa, Buchenavia corrugata, Ferdinandusa cordata, Pouteria speciosa and Lepidocordia punctata. =Fauna= Two captive sun parakeets (Aratinga solstitialis) 175 species of mammals have been reported of which over 80 are bats. Primates include red- faced spider monkey (Ateles paniscus), pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus) and red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas). Other mammals include jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), anteaters, opossums and many rodents. Endangered mammals include the black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 42 frog species have been recorded around Manaus including the Surinam horned frog (Ceratophrys cornuta) and tree frogs (genus Hyla). 62 snake species have been recorded including the common lancehead (Bothrops atrox), bushmaster (Lachesis muta) and boa constrictor (Boa constrictor). 23 species of lizards include the green iguana (Iguana iguana) and many geckos. 482 species of birds have been reported including tinamous (genus Crypturellus), parrots (genus Amazona), macaws (genus Ara), cookoos (genus Coccyzus), potoos (family Nyctibiidae) and tanagers (genus Tachyphonus). Endangered birds include the sun parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis). Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". The habitat is fairly intact in the interior, but continues to suffer from deforestation along the main roads and rivers, around and to the north of Manaus, and in the region from √ìbidos to Monte Alegre along the Amazon. Cattle ranchers have cleared large areas of forest, as have commercial plantations around the Jari River and forestry in the east of the region. Some species are threatened by the trade in wildlife, by hunting and by selective logging. Upland areas have been destroyed by mining, which has polluted the rivers. Huge areas of upland forest were submerged by the Balbina Dam in the southwest. The Rio Trombetas Biological Reserve and the Jari Ecological Station protect parts of the ecoregion.

Previously, she played for Tasmanian Roar and the Hobart Hurricanes. She made her international debut for the Australia women's cricket team in September 2019. Early life Born in Wollongong, Burns found herself unable to progress any further through the strong New South Wales system than the state's second XI. In 2009, however, the Tasmanian Roar was casting around for extra talent for its entry to interstate competition, and rang Burns with an offer of a place which she accepted. Tasmanian Roar Burns won the Tasmanian Roar Player of the Year award for 2009‚Äì10. She was a squad member of the Southern Stars in 2011, and toured New Zealand with the Shooting Stars in 2012. She remained part of the Shooting Stars squad, and was once again Tasmanian Roar Player of the Year, in 2012‚Äì13. In that season's Australian Women's Twenty20 Cup, she played such a prominent role for the Roar, including by hitting 90 runs against Victorian Spirit off just 50 deliveries, with 10 boundaries and four sixes, that she was named the ACA women's Player of the Month for December 2012. In late 2013, Burns suffered a serious cartilage tear in her knee that threatened her playing career. However, Sydney Swans club doctor Nathan Gibbs treated the injury with stem cell injections, which were more effective than anticipated; Burns returned to the Roar at a T20 match in November 2014. In October 2016, during the opening round of that season's WNCL, Burns top scored for the Roar in the match against the South Australian Scorpions with 45 runs, and also took two wickets. Hobart Hurricanes Burns was included in the Hurricanes squad for its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015‚Äì16), during which she scored 224 runs at 17.23 with a highest score of 34, and took 7 wickets at 30.14 with best figures of 2/22. She also achieved the feat of taking three catches in a single innings. During the WBBL02 season (2016‚Äì17), Burns played a key role in two Hurricanes wins. On 18 December 2016, she hit a four through mid-wicket off the final ball of a super over to claim victory against the Melbourne Renegades, and propel the Hurricanes to equal first on the WBBL table. On 5 January 2017, after being promoted to open the Hurricanes' innings against Sydney Thunder, she scored 46 runs, and shared in a second wicket partnership of 64 with Heather Knight, to help lead the Hurricanes to a match winning 171/3, which eventually proved to be the highest innings total for WBBL02. In November 2018, she was named in the Sydney Sixers' squad for the 2018‚Äì19 Women's Big Bash League season. International career In August 2019, Burns was named in Australia's squad for their series against the West Indies. She made her Women's One Day International (WODI) debut for Australia against the West Indies on 8 September 2019. She made her Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) debut for Australia, also against the West Indies, on 14 September 2019. In January 2020, she was named in Australia's squad for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia. Personal life Burns completed a degree in Exercise Science in 2009, and later, with the assistance of a University of Sydney Elite Athlete Program (EAP) scholarship, obtained a Masters in Physiotherapy. She has worked as both an Exercise Physiologist and Physiotherapist, and has a particular interest in sporting injuries. While undergoing rehabilitation for her knee injury, Burns took up cycling to strengthen her knee. In 2015, she completed a bike ride from her home town of Wollongong to Melbourne to raise money for Bowel Cancer Australia, in honour of her late father, who died from the disease in 2005.

In the wild it grows in moist grassland, forest glades and margins, at altitudes between 1200 and 3400 m (3900‚Äì11.000 ft), in eastern Africa, from South Africa to Ethiopia, in Cameroun and Nigeria, and on Madagascar and Bioko. Vernacular names are bezongozongo in Madagascar, and dukunsha in Ethiopia.  Description  left Viola abyssinica is a low, somewhat weedy perennial herbaceous plant with long, thin, slightly winged, sparingly branching stems that creep along the surface, taking root at the nodes or scrambling through other vegetation. The leaves of about 1¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (0.6‚Äì1.6 in) long and 1¬º‚Äì3‚Öì cm (0.5‚Äì1.3 in) wide, which are alternate set along the stems are oval, have a hart-shaped foot, a scalloped to toothy margin and a pointy tip. These may have a few hairs along the veins at the upper side, but are distinctly hairy below. They are on a leaf stalk of ¬Ω‚Äì3¬Ω cm (0.2‚Äì1.5 in) long, which carries at its base two leafy stipules of ‚Öú‚Äì1¬º cm (0.15‚Äì0.50 in) long, that are deeply incised in the lower half. The flowers are on long, slender flower stalks of 3‚Äì7 cm (1.2‚Äì2.8 in) long, which carry a pair of narrow triangular bracteoles of 2‚Äì5 mm (0.08‚Äì0.20 in) long in the upper half. The sepals are green, narrow, 5‚Äì7 mm (0.20‚Äì0.28 in) long and without a basal appendage, hairy along the midrib and sometimes with a regular row of hairs along the outline. The upper and lateral petals are 7‚Äì9 mm (0.28‚Äì0.36 in) long, whitish, pale mauve or bluish in color. The lowest petal is with 5‚Äì7 mm (0.20‚Äì0.28 in) shorter than the other four, marked with dark purple stripes, and carries a blunt spur of 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) long. The stamens are about ‚Öì√ó as long as the lateral petals, orange to golden brown in color, with the style just reaching beyond them. The fruit is a small, yellowish and hairless, 4‚Äì6 mm (0.16‚Äì0.24 in) long capsule with three parts, that splits when ripe, eventually squeezing out the 1‚Äì2 mm (0.04‚Äì0.08 in) long seeds with such a force that they shoot away. The seeds have a clear, spongy elaiosome. In Zambia the plants flower from October to March. cited on  Distribution  The Abyssinian violet grows in highlands from Ethiopia southwards to South Africa. It can also be found in south-eastern Nigeria, southern Cameroun, on Bioko and Madagascar.  Ecology  The caterpillars of Issoria species, such as I. smaragdifera and I. hanningtoni, feed on V. abyssinica. The spongy, fatty ant bread on the seeds, makes them attractive for ants, who bring them to their nests, and eat the ant bread. The seed than is discarded onto the ants' waste dump, which is rich in nutrients. This assists in further dispersing this plant.  Uses  In Ethiopia, leaves of Viola abyssinica are crushed and squeezed to get the juice, which is applied to hard leather, which it helps to soften. In Madagascar it is given as an antidote and to stimulate vomiting in a traditional medicine. Along the eastern border of Congo, it is rubbed with other herbs in butter to make a massage oil. Several unique cyclotides have been isolated from this species, that have cytotoxic properties and may be of use in the development of future medicines.

His activities mainly took place in the region of the County of Toulouse between 1243 and 1249. He originated the investigation processes and his witness interrogations are recorded in a 13th-century transcribed manuscript preserved in the library of Toulouse.  Life and work  Bernard de Caux was born in the Diocese of B√©ziers but the date is not known and became a Dominican friar who was appointed as an inquisitor. Bernard Gui, an early 14th-century French inquisitor, described de Caux thus: . (Brother Bernard de Caucoi, inquisitor and persecutor and the hammer of heretics, a holy man filled with God.) De Caux was known as the inquisitor of the dioceses of Agen and Cahors, of Carcassonne, and finally Toulouse. His inquisitions were made in conjunction with another Dominican friar, Jean de Saint-Pierre. Raymond VII of Toulouse The Medieval Inquisition in the diocese of Agen was under the control of the tribunal of Toulouse. In 1242 the search and prosecution of the Cathar heretics was given to them by their provincial prior according to the papal bull ' authorised by Pope Gregory IX, who entrusted the Dominicans with the ' (the business of faith against heretics), in 1233\\\\. The count of Toulouse, Raymond VII, with the support of the bishop of Agen, opposed this appointment, appealing to the pope, on the pretext that the pursuit of heretics was to be done under the direction of the bishop, according to the normal procedure. However, Bernard de Caux and Jean de Saint- Pierre wrote their first acts at Agen in 1243, where they remained until March 1244. They were in Cahors until February 1245, then in Montauban, in Toulouse from May 1245 to July 1246 and again from August 1247 until June 1248. Finally he was in Carcassonne until sometime between June and November 1249 he returned to Agen to be in charge of the foundation of the convent of the Jacobins, as Bernard Gui writes: fuit fundator precipuus et promotor conventus Agennesis (as the distinguished founder and promoter of the Agen convent). The first Dominican friars settled in Agen in November 1249 and the new Count of Toulouse Alphonse de Poitiers took the Agen convent under his protection on 12 June 1251. A Toulousien house, opposite the abbey of Saint-Sernin, was bought by the bishop of Agen in 1249, given to de Caux to use as a prison in which heretics were imprisoned, awaiting their condemnation. In August 1250 the house was donated to the abbot of Saint-Sernin and the hospital of Saint- Raymond to house poor students, and is now the Mus√©e Saint-Raymond. De Caux died on 26 (or 27) November 1252 in Agen. His body was later exhumed and buried in the church of the Jacobins of Agen on 26 April 1281 with two other founders of the convent, brother Bertrand de Belcastel and master Arnaud B√©langer. His body was found to be well preserved; it was placed on display so the people of Agen could see what was considered a miracle.  Interrogations  First page of Bernard de Caux witness interrogations - '''' One of the oldest surviving European paper manuscripts, transcribed between 1256 and 1263, are the 5,000 plus witness interrogations and sentences meted out by Bernard de Caux, and held in the and the library of Toulouse. These interrogations are grouped by village or parish as opposed to later records that list by deponents. The inquisitors were keen to record their work and measures were taken to secure them. Bernard de Caux originated an interrogation procedure described in his Manual of the Inquisitors of Carcassonne or ' (investigation processes), used for half a century before being replaced by the Manual of the Inquisitor of Bernard Gui. It lists the facts: * The papal bull ' placed the following constraints on the use of torture: * *that it did not cause loss of life or limb () * *that it was used only once * *that the Inquisitor deemed the evidence against the accused to be virtually certain. De Caux and de Saint-Pierre interviewed several thousand people of which 5,065 transcripts of their interrogations were made. Yves Dossat's studies show that life sentences were seldom made.

Her research focuses on the similarities of the mechanism of nerve and blood vessel development. She has worked alongside her husband, Till Acker, who is a neurobiologist, in researching tumor therapies. In her career, she has won several awards, including the Paul Ehrlich & Ludwig Darmstaeder Prize for Young Researchers in 2010. In 2012, Amparo Acker-Palmer was elected as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.https://www.leopoldina.org/de/mitglieder/mitgliederverzeichnis/member/1544/  Education and career  Originally from Sueca, Valencia, Spain, Acker- Palmer obtained a B.A. in biology and biochemistry in the University of Valencia in 1991. After graduating, she completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany in 1996 after obtaining a PhD in biology in the University of Valencia in the same year. In 2001, she moved to Martinsried to take the position as a junior group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology for six years. At Goethe University she was nominated as Professor of Cluster of Excellence \\"Macromolecular Complexes\\" in 2007. Later in 2011, Acker-Palmer became the head of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology at Goethe University, while working on research in a specialised program known as the Focus Program Translational Neurosciences (FTN). During this time she was a faculty member at the Johannes Gutenberg‚ÄìUniversity Mainz through her GFK Fellowship. In 2014, she was then elected as a Max Planck Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, where she conducted research focused on the mechanics of nerve and blood vessel communication.  Research  Acker- Palmer's work focused on the mechanism of the development of nerve and blood vessel at the molecular level. Alongside her colleagues, she published her work in Nature in 2010, as \\"EphrinB2 regulates VEGFR2 function in developmental and tumour angiogenesis\\". She won the Paul Ehrlich & Ludwig Darmstaeder Prize for Young Researchers for discovering the similarities between nerve and blood vessel development. Ephrin is one of the axon's guiding molecules during the development of the central nervous system. Her research examines the role of one of Ephrin's receptor's transmembrane ligand, Ephrin-B2 in particular, in developmental angiogenesis. However, the validity of the study's data was placed under scrutiny by Nature's readership due to its questionable figures. To clarify the situation, a letter along with supplementary information was issued by the authors explaining the errors made. According to Nature, although several images were incorrectly labelled, the errors have no effect on the experiment's original conclusion. The authors have also conducted another experiment for further verification, which confirmed their results.

Career Elena Traycheva Georgieva was a student of Lyubomir Andreychin and spent her career working for the Institute for Bulgarian Language under the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. She was the first administrative specialist assigned to the institute upon its creation. Georgieva taught at several universities, including Plovdiv University \\"Paisii Hilendarski\\" and Shumen University and lectured on the Bulgarian language in France. Georgieva's research covered a broad spectrum of modern Bulgarian language, touching on grammar, history, morphology and syntax, and she was a prolific writer of both analysis and textbooks. In 1974, she published Simple word order in sentences in Bulgarian literary language (), which had a profound impact on linguistic studies. It was not the first study of Bulgarian syntax, but it was the first study to show that word order depended not only on the subject matter but also on the intent of the message being conveyed. Instead of routinely conveying words in the format of subject, verb, object, they might be presented in another format to convey emphasis. Georgieva was a long-time contributor to the journal Bulgarian Language and Literature (). In addition to her own publishing, she served as both an editor and one of the writers on the most important three- volume academic publication on grammar of the Bulgarian language, Grammar of contemporary Bulgarian literary language, as well as the History of Modern Literary Language and a dictionary.

Education Gryte was born in Kaunas into a family of artists (her father, Algirdas Pintukas, is an actor of Kaunas State Drama Theatre). After the Art Gymnasium in Kaunas and the Kankaapaa School of Arts in Finland, she studied Painting in Vilnius Academy of Arts (Bachelor and Master of Arts under the supervision of the painters Leopoldas Surgailius and Arvydas ≈†altenis). Since 2002 she is also a pedagogue of Arts and curator of exhibitions for young talents Artistic production and vision Regarding her artistic vision and style, the philosopher and art critic Algis U≈ædavinys wrote about an \\"intimate female humanism of the artist and \\"a meditation to feel not only the fragility of the human nature but also the deep nobleness of its incarnated spiritual world, real portrayal and picture of God where she likes to submerge herself, with tender clemency, like in a fog of heady dreams, in order to create her original version of the reality and of the existence myth\\". Therefore, her figures are almost always slightly stylized and supplemental semantic metaphors, especially in portrait compositions, are often introduced. In choosing the subjects of her pictures, Gryte often comes back to loved motives such as an image of a granny or a mother with a baby or just faces, that she loves to draw according to their real emanation, the one that she perceives. So, she could paint, for example, the Lithuanian artist Antanas Tamo≈°aitis, that she met in his hospital bed just some time before his death at the age of 100 years old, as well as many other singers, actors, poets, musicians, conductors, etc. that she painted during almost 25 years of activity. Awards *In 2000 she received the award for the best painting in the exhibition \\"One Picture Contest\\" in Vilnius. *In 2004 she received the award for \\"The best work of the year\\" in the homonym exhibition in Kaunas.  Influences from other arts  Gryte's training as painter was affected by other artistic disciplines, especially theatre and music (lyric singing). In Kaunas she studied at the Drama Theatre, got a diploma in Expressive Reading and received \\"The Silver Voices\\" (Sidabriniai Balsai) award. As singer, after private studies in Finland, Russia and Lithuania, she collaborated in the years 2001-2003 with the composer Arturas Bum≈°teinas and, in 2006, with the group Sel. She also works also as clothes designer for fashion and theatre events and collaborates occasionally with some newspapers and art magazines as art/theatre critic Exhibitions From 1993 until 2016, Grytƒó Pintukaitƒó has organized 34 personal exhibitions, participated in 63 group exhibitions (the most important were the Venice Biennale in Italy, the Beijing International Art Biennale and the Silk Road International Festival in China ) and in 10 international Art Symposia and Plein Airs. She took part also in other international exhibitions in Finland, Belarus, Denmark and Latvia.

It propagates by seed in containers in a cold frame in spring, and semi-ripe cuttings can also be rooted in summer. This species makes a very good wind-shelter hedge in exposed maritime positions, though it is slow growing. Plants can be used as a tall ground cover when planted about apart each way.

It is located on America Sur Avenue, 1 mile (0.6 km) south of the main city square in La Merced neighborhood. The 6.5-acre (2.5 ha) garden contains 250 catalogued plant species, in addition to a number of unidentified plants among its collections. The garden houses a number of endangered plants, as well as an ethnobotanical collection (which includes medicinal, ornamental, and crop plants native to the Americas). A number of animals also reside in the grounds, such as peacocks, turtles, and parrots. History Prior to 1993, the site where the garden currently stands was fallow land. During that year, neighborhood groups organized a clean-up campaign, and renamed the area as \\"Parque de la Cultura\\". It was then when the first trees were planted, such as Casuarina, Flamboyant trees, Eucalyptus, Acacias, and Figs. The acid soil on the grounds was another challenge, which the neighborhood groups tackled successfully. But as the trees took hold and grew, they provided refuge for pickpockets and petty criminals. The lack of security and high crime incidence made the park infamous during the 1990s. As a result, the local government installed security fencing and lighting, reducing the problem. Year after year, more trees were planted by both volunteers and the local municipality. in 2003, the local neighborhood groups successfully lobbied for a name change of the park to Jard√≠n Bot√°nico. Currently it is one of the few verdant refuges in the city, popular with locals and visitors alike.

She is the author of graphic memoirs Virus Tropical (2011), Por Dentro (2012), Diario (2013), qp (2014), Todo Va a Estar Bien (2015) and Nos vamos (2016). Her work deals with themes of sexuality, feminism, family, and personal identity. She is a member of the international comics collective Chicks on Comics.  Biography  = Early life = Paola Gaviria, known by the pen name Power Paola, was born in Quito, Ecuador. During her mother's pregnancy, a doctor insisted that she was not pregnant but was the victim of a \\"tropical virus.\\" Her family moved to Cali, Colombia when she was 13 and she studied at the Fundaci√≥n Universitaria de Bellas Artes in Medellin, where she cofounded the art collective Taller 7. She describes herself as a \\"nomad\\" and has since lived in Sydney, Paris, San Salvador, and Bogota, though she now lives in Buenos Aires. = Comics = Power Paola initially worked as painter, then started reading the work of comics artists like Marjane Satrapi and Julie Doucet. She started drawing comics at age 27, to entertain herself and document her life while working in a kitchen in Sydney. She initially self-published her comics on Flickr and as print zines. In 2011, Argentinian publisher Editorial Comun published her memoir Virus Tropical, which tells the story of Paola's childhood growing up as a rebellious daughter in a conservative Colombian family dominated by strong women. The book was met with critical praise and republished in English and French by Random House / Mondadori. Critics have noted her loose drawing style and intimate voice. Of Virus Tropical, reviewer Josep Oliver said, \\"Using a strongly expressive na√Øve style, Paola creates a very personal comic, with a clear feminine voice, that is a standard bearer of the comic of those latitudes.\\" Reviewer Abril Castillo Cabrera compared reading the book to visiting a therapist, writing that Power Paola creates \\"an atmosphere that we can access, a story with a beginning and a closing, an elaboration of her life and a bridge that tends to the lives of others who read it.\\" Her work was shown at Fundacion PROA in Buenos Aires as part of the Chicks on Comics exhibition \\"Long Distance Relationship\\" in 2017.

The decreasing radii of the electrodes is visible from this angle. in mass spectrometry, an ion funnel is a device used to focus a beam of ions using a series of stacked ring electrodes with decreasing inner diameter. A combined radio frequency and fixed electrical potential is applied to the grids. In electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), ions are created at atmospheric pressure, but are analyzed at subsequently lower pressures. Ions can be lost while they are shuttled from areas of higher to lower pressure due to the transmission process caused by a phenomenon called joule expansion or ‚Äúfree-jet expansion.‚Äù These ion clouds expand outward, which limits the amount of ions that reach the detector, so fewer ions are analyzed. The ion funnel refocuses and transmits ions efficiently from those areas of high to low pressure. History The first ion funnel was created in 1997 in the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory Pacific Northwest National Laboratory by the researchers in Richard D. Smith's lab. The ion funnel was implemented to replace the ion transmission-limited skimmer for more efficient ion capture in an ESI source. Many characteristics of the ion funnel are attributed to the stacked ring ion guide, however, the disks of an ion funnel vary in diameter down its long axis. There is a portion at the base of the ion funnel in which a series of cylindrical ring electrodes have decreasing diameters, which enables the ion cloud entering the ion funnel to be spatially dispersed. This allows for efficient transfer of the ion cloud through the conductance limiting orifice at the exit as the ion cloud becomes focused to a much smaller radial size. The DC electric field serves to push ions through the funnel. For positive ions, the front plate of the funnel has the most positive DC voltage, and subsequent plates have gradually decreasing DC components, providing added control. RF and DC electric fields are co- applied with a pseudopotential created with alternating RF polarities on adjacent electrodes. This ‚Äúpseudo-potential‚Äù radially confines ions and causes instability in ions with a lower m/z (mass to charge ratio) while ions with a higher m/z are focused to the center of the funnel. The initial ion funnel design used in the Smith research lab proved inefficient for collecting ions with low m/z. Simulations suggest that decreasing the spacing between the lenses so that they are less than the diameter of the smallest ring electrode could be a plausible solution to this problem. Another issue with the design is that the funnel is susceptible to noise with fast neutrals and charged droplets at many atmospheric interfaces during the initial vacuum phase. Modifications increase the efficiency and signal to noise ratio of the ion funnel. Some of the earliest ion funnels struggled to control gas flow as the pressure in the ion vacuum chamber was not uniform due to gas dynamic effects. The pressure at the funnel's exit was estimated to be 2 to 3 times higher than the pressure from the pressure gauge. The higher pressure required greater pumping in downstream vacuum chambers to compensate for the larger injection of gas. The discrepancy between the measured pressure and the pressure at the exit of the funnel was caused by the a sizable portion of the supersonic gas jet from the injector continuing beyond the Mach disk or shock diamond at the beginning of the funnel and continuing through until the end. The most effective resolution is the us of a jet disrupter that consists of a 9 mm diameter brass disk suspended perpendicular to the gas flow in the center of the ion funnel. Applications = Mass spectrometry = Ion funnels are frequently used in mass spectroscopy devices to collect ions from an ionization source. Previous devices lacking an ion funnel often lost ions during the transition from ionization source to the detector of the mass spectrometer. This loss was due to the increasing number of collisions undergone by ions with other gas molecules present in the atmosphere. The introduction of the ion funnel greatly reduced the amount of ions lost during experiments by guiding ions towards a desired destinationSmith, Richard D.; Shaffer, Scott A.

June 3, 1998, and through modification of the number of inlets is also able to increases sensitivity of measurements taken by the mass spectrometer. Multiple inlets allow multiple electrospray emitters, reducing the flow through each individual emitter. This creates many highly efficient electrosprays at low flow rates. Multiple inlets also improve sensitivity, with a linearly arranged 19 electrospray emitter coupled to 19 inlets operating at 18 Torr giving a nine-fold increase compared to a single inlet. =Proton transfer reaction chamber= Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry has traditionally used drift tubes as ion traps. However, radio frequency ion funnels offer an attractive alternative, as they improve compound specific sensitivity significantly. This is due to increasing the effective reaction time and focusing the ions. The same pressure ranges are required for ion funnels and drift tubes, so the technology is not difficult to implement. Ion funnels have been shown to favor transmission of ions with high m/z. =Breath analysis= Breath analysis is a convenient and non- invasive way to detect chemicals in a bodily system such as alcohol content to determine intoxication, monitor the levels of anesthetics in the body during surgical procedures, and identify performance-enhancing substances in the system of athletes. However, conventional techniques are ineffective at low concentrations. An electrospray ionization interface assisted by an ion funnel used in a linear trap quadrupole Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer was shown to greatly increase sensitivity with high resolution.
