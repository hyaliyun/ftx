She won a bronze medal in small-bore rifle prone at the 2000 Asian Championships in Langkawi, Malaysia, and was selected to compete for Uzbekistan in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Akysonova's Olympic debut came as a 21-year-old at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. There, she finished in a massive eight-way tie for twentieth place in the 10 m air rifle with a qualifying score of 391, just three points below the Olympic final cutoff. Akysonova also competed in the 50 m rifle 3 positions, but plummeted to a thirtieth-place tie with Cuba's Eunice Caballero and fellow markswoman Yuliya Shakhova at 567 points (194 in prone, 185 in standing, and 188 in the kneeling series) in the prelims. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Aksyonova qualified as a lone markswoman for her second Uzbek team in rifle shooting. She managed to get a minimum qualifying standard of a near- perfect 399 to secure an Olympic berth for Uzbekistan in air rifle, following her seventh-place finish at the Asian Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia few months earlier. In the 10 m air rifle, held on the first day of the Games, Akysonova fired an ill-fated 384 out of a possible 400 to finish in a distant fortieth out of forty-four shooters. Nearly a week later, in the 50 m rifle 3 positions, Aksyonova marked 193 in prone, a substandard 175 in standing, and 190 in the kneeling series to accumulate a total score of 562 points in the qualifying round, closing her out of the final to twenty-ninth place.

He was elected as a federal representative of the PFL, but was expelled by his party after his criminal activity came to light. He is best known for his brutality, including dismemberment by chainsaw, then killing with either a stake or bullet through the head.  Crimes and career  Hildebrando worked most of his career in the Military Police, earning the rank of commander and then colonel. He then was elected State Representative in 1994, with the support of Orleir Cameli and Ronivon Santiago (both of whom have also been investigated for corruption). As early as 1995, Brazilian human rights groups and the Ministry of Justice (Brazil) were investigating Hildebrando. During these early periods, there were widespread reports that he dismembered victims with a chainsaw and participated in the drug trafficking trade he was tasked with fighting. However, during this investigation, most of the witnesses were assassinated, including a former accomplice of Hildebrando named Sebasti√£o Crispim. He was found dismembered with his eyes torn out. Another witness was kidnapped with his two sons, ruthlessly tortured, and then killed. Others were killed and then dissolved in acid. His most famous killing was of the Baiano, Agilson Firmino dos Santos. He was a mechanic that was rumored to have participated in the killing of Hildebrando's brother. He tortured Santos and chopped him to pieces with a chainsaw. While leading the criminal enterprise in the state, he participated in violent and horrific methods of enforcing his criminal rule. \\"One witness said he accompanied Mr Pascoal across the border to Bolivia, where the congressman picked up nearly 1,000 kg of cocaine. The same witness said that under orders from his boss he helped to kill 10 people.\\"  Attempt at national politics  Despite these accusations, Hildebrando was elected aa a Federal Representative to the Chamber of Deputies in 1998. A few months later in 1999, Hildebrando was forced to resign after official charges were levied against him.  Sentence  In 2006 (and reaffirmed in 2009),Hildebrando was convicted of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, torture, electoral corruption, leading a death squad in Acre, and coordinating an organized crime operation for drug trafficking and cargo theft. He has been sentenced to serve 18.5 years in prison. However, with cases still pending, he could face more than 100 years.

It can be used to help students form individual ideas, discuss and share with the others in-group. It can be used before reading or teaching a concept and works better with smaller groups. Process In think-pair-share strategy the teacher acts as a facilitator, and poses a question or a problem to the students. The students are given sufficient time to think and gather their thoughts, after which the teacher asks them to pair themselves and share their thoughts with each other. As the students begin to share their thoughts and views, each learns to see the different perspectives of thinking among their peers. By doing so the students' learning is enhanced by the formation and articulation of an idea. This also enables the students to have clarity of thought and have the ability to communicate their thoughts and ideas to another student. If time permits, the paired students can share their thoughts with other paired students, and teachers can ask one or two pairs to share their ideas with the entire class. Think-pair-share is designed to help the student to understand the concept of the given topic, develop ability to filter the information and formulate an idea or thought, and draw conclusions. The most important aspect of the think- pair-share is that students will develop the ability to consider and appreciate the different viewpoints of their peers.  Advantages  *The process is easy to prepare and takes only a small amount of time to perform in class. *The interaction with students at personal level is intended to motivate those students who may not be generally interested in the topic. *Different kinds and levels of questions can be asked from lower order to higher order thinking questions. *Teacher can understand the different thought processes of the students while listening to the pairs and when the students share their view at the end.

Gameplay Headlander takes place in a futuristic setting inspired by 1970s science fiction televisions shows and movies such as Logan's Run. In this future, humanity has opted to upload their consciousnesses to a world-encompassing cloud storage, forgoing their bodies but able to occupy the minds of robots as to carry out necessary tasks or otherwise enjoy corporeal pleasures. However, an artificial intelligence named Methuselah has taken control of the robots, trapping the human consciousnesses inside them, and enslaved them for some nefarious purpose. The last human is awoken from cryogenic storage to deal with Methuselah, but only their head has managed to survive the process and is suffering from amnesia. Headlander plays out as a 2.5D Metroidvania-style game. The character's head, equipped in a special helmet that allows the head to fly around, can also use its tractor beam to take the heads off the robots and use their bodies as needed. Robots have specialized functions, so the player may be required to find the right type of robots and maneuver it through the game world to complete a task, such as using a security robot to open a door. The helmet includes a laser system that can be used to damage robots and protect itself, and can gain additional powerups that grant access to other areas of the game world. At times, the player is limited to using only the helmet and needs to fight through sections that are similar to bullet hell games. At other times, the player can also opt to use a robot body to engage in combat, which can include both ranged and melee fights, depending on what type of robot they choose. Development Headlander was announced at the 2015 PAX Prime expo. Double Fine Productions is handling development duties for the game, with Lee Petty overseeing its team, while Adult Swim Games will distribute the title. The game was released on July 26, 2016 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4. On November 17, 2016, Headlander was released for Xbox One. Reception Headlander received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics according to aggregate review website Metacritic.

He is currently the President and CEO of Illusive Networks, a startup from the Israel-based incubator, Team8. Career Touboul's career began in earnest with the founding of Shani (or Shany) Computers in 1985. The Israeli company and its California subsidiary were sold to Intel in 1994 for between $15 million and $20 million. This sale marked the first time a United States corporation had come to Israel to purchase a startup. He went on to work for Intel as a manager in their Network Management Business Unit. In 1996, he founded Finjan Software Inc. The company designed and patented antivirus software and anti-spyware software. In 1997, the company received $10 million in investor funding. In 2000, Touboul left Finjan to start Runway, Israel's first internet incubator, and Runway Telecom Partners, an Israeli telecommunications incubator co-founded with Alcatel. Alcatel invested $14 million in Runway Telecom in 2001. Also in 2001, Finjan encountered financial difficulties and Touboul returned to the company at the request of investor, David Cowan of Bessemer Venture Partners. As CEO of Finjan, Touboul often spoke about the risks of advanced spyware and the security gaps in programs and programming languages like JavaScript. He also invented new technologies including static and dynamic code behavior analysis and behavior based blocking technology. Touboul helped aggressively market Finjan's proactive defense technology and McAfee incorporated that technology into their products. Touboul also pushed for more funding. Finjan secured $8.5 million in funding from an investor group led by Benchmark Capital Israel, Israel Seed Partners, and Bessemer Venture Partners. This brought the total amount of funding to $31.5 million over the course of 6 years. Touboul helped Finjan earn an additional $10 million in funding in 2004 from investors including Cisco Systems, Bessemer Venture Partners, Israel Seed Partners, and Benchmark Capital. Finjan terminated Touboul in July 2005. He started Yoggie Security Systems 3 weeks after his departure from Finjan. This new company designed hardware to solve security issues for individuals using laptops or mobile devices on a public Wi-Fi signal. The hardware also kept security tasks separate from the computer's main CPU, implementing the first security dedicated co-processor for networked based computers and devices. Touboul invented 8 patents for Yoggie. Among the Yoggie products are the Yoggie Gatekeeper Pico and the Gatekeeper Card. Within the first year of its operation, Yoggie received $1.8 million in investment funding from investors in Silicon Valley, Israel, and New York City (including Earlybird Venture Capital). In total, Touboul helped raise around $18 million in funding for Yoggie, and the company was eventually sold to Norway-based Cupp Computing in 2011. In 2014, Touboul became the CEO of Illusive Networks, a company founded by Ofer Israeli and Israeli incubator, Team8. Illusive Networks received $5 million in Series A funding from Team8 which had a capital investment of $18 million from investors like Google Chairman Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavor, Marker LLC, Cisco, Alcatel, Bessemer Venture Partners, and others. The company provides information security by deliberately deceiving hackers and tricking them into collecting and using information that is false. The software provides early detection of attacks and advanced persistent threats. Touboul is the current CEO of the company.

The company produces technology that stops cyber attackers from moving laterally inside networks by finding and eliminating errant credentials and connections, planting false information about given network's resources, emulating devices, and deploying high interactivity decoys. Network administrators are alerted when cyber attackers use security deceptions in an attempt to exploit the network. Illusive Networks is the first company launched by the Tel Aviv-based incubator, Team8. In June 2015, Illusive Networks received $5 million in Series A funding from Team8. To date, it has raised over $30M. History Illusive Networks headquarters in TelAviv Illusive Networks was founded in 2014 by Team8 and Ofer Israeli. In June 2015, Illusive received $5 million in Series A funding from cybersecurity incubator, Team8. Team8 is funded by a group of investors, including Google Chairman Eric Schmidt's venture capital fund, Innovation Endeavors, Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco Systems, Marker LLC, Bessemer Venture Partners, and others. While in Israel at the 5th Annual International Cybersecurity Conference in 2015, Schmidt paid a visit to Illusive Networks' headquarters on June 9 during the company's official launch. The company was named one of Gartner's Cool Vendors in Security and Intelligence for 2015. After receiving $5 million in Series A funding back in June 2015, Illusive Networks announced on October 20, 2015, their Series B round of $22 million by New Enterprise Associates. Technology The software produced by Illusive Networks is designed to stop cyber attacks from moving laterally inside networks, to provide early detection of cyber attackers who have penetrated a given network, and to provide forensics to threat intelligence teams and incident responders. The software blocks intruders from advancing their attacks by eliminating credentials and connections left behind by normal business processes, by providing false and misleading information that appears alongside real, valuable information, and by deploying devices and decoys to attract and distract attackers. The software is designed to thwart attacks and advanced persistent threats. Instead of targeting just malware, the Illusive software targets actual human beings (cyber attackers) who must make decisions at each step in the process in order to advance further into a network. If the attackers use the deceptive lures during the attack, network administrators will be alerted and given the option to shut the attack down immediately or observe the hacker accruing real-time breach forensics. The software has more than 50,000 users at Fortune 500 companies, healthcare companies, insurance companies, legal firms, and others.

The Vaqueros joined the league as a replacement team for the departed Senadores de San Juan.

The Vaqueros won league pennants in the 1974‚Äì75, 1975‚Äì76, 1979‚Äì80 and 2001‚Äì02 seasons, winning the championship in its inaugural season and the right to represent Puerto Rico in the 1975 Caribbean Series, which was held at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Bayam√≥n club clinched the Series and was managed by Jos√© Pag√°n, winning five games in a row before losing to the Dominican Republic's √Åguilas Cibae√±as in the closing game, 5 to 4. Leading the offensive charge in the Series was Ken Griffey, Sr., who won the batting title with a .500 average (12-for-24) and scored the most runs in the tournament (eight). Other contributions came from F√©lix Mill√°n, who hit .435 (10-for-23) for the second best average, and Willie Monta√±ez, who led all hitters with 11 runs batted in and tied for the most home runs (2), earning Most Valuable Player honors.N√∫√±ez, Jos√© Antero (1987).

The Puerto Rican team also had a well-balanced lineup that included Orlando √Ålvarez, Sergio Ferrer, Art Howe, Jay Johnstone, Jerry Morales and Eliseo Rodr√≠guez. On the other side, the pitching staff was headed by John Montague, who hurled a four-hit shutout, backed up by Tom Walker and Tom Hilgendorf, each winners in their respective starts. A solid bullpen was anchored by John Candelaria, Ed Figueroa, Jaime Navarro and Carlos Vel√°zquez.B√©isbol de los Vaqueros de Bayam√≥n, por Edwin 'Kako' V√°zquez (Spanish). 1-800-Beisbol.com. Retrieved on August 31, 2015. In the 2001‚Äì02 season Bayam√≥n was the team nobody picked to win the Puerto Rican league crown. Nevertheless, the franchise that Carlos Baerga saved from bankruptcy two seasons prior headed to their first Caribbean Series since 1980. Since Baerga bought the ailing club it had failed to even make the playoffs. Then this time the underdog Vaqueros managed by Carmelo Mart√≠nez beat the highly favored Cangrejeros de Santurce of Mako Oliveras in the championship series, being guided by Baerga, who posted a .500 batting average with three RBI and seven runs scored, leading him subsequently to be named series MVP en route to the 2002 Caribbean Series.Campeonato para Bayam√≥n (Spanish).

But the Vaqueros failed from Day 1 at the Caribbean Series held in Caracas, Venezuela. Bayam√≥n's import pitching, solid and sharp in the Puerto Rico playoffs, opted not to join the team for the trip. As a result, none of Bayam√≥n's emergency starters in its first three games in Caracas made it past the fifth inning. It was not until Game 4 with the team 0‚Äì3 and all but mathematically eliminated from contention, that Puerto Rico won a game on a solid pitching effort. The team that Baerga built pulled out an 8‚Äì4 victory over their rivals Tigres del Licey of the Dominican Republic, with Omar Olivares allowing just four hits and two runs over seven innings of work. But was too late for Puerto Rico, whose role in the tournament would be as a spoiler for the other three teams, ending with a 2‚Äì4 record while tying for third place with the local Navegantes de Magallanes, behind Mexico's Tomateros de Culiac√°n (5‚Äì1) and the Dominican's Tigres del Licey (3‚Äì3).

She had been granted an Olympic invitation for her country by ISSF and IOC, having registered a minimum qualifying standard of 382 in air rifle at the ISSF World Cup meet in Zagreb, Croatia a year earlier. In the 10 m air rifle, held on the first day of the Games, Pe≈°iƒá fired an ill-fated 368 out of a possible 400 to round off the 44-shooter field in last place. Nearly a week later, in the 50 m rifle 3 positions, Pe≈°iƒá marked 188 in prone, a substandard 182 in standing, and 185 in the kneeling series to accumulate a total score of 555 points in the qualifying round, closing her out of the final to a two-way tie with Australia's Kim Frazer for thirty-second place.

In particular, she has studied racial and ethnic classification on censuses worldwide, as well as beliefs about racial difference in the United States and Western Europe. Much of her work examines how contemporary science‚Äîparticularly the field of genetics‚Äîinfluences how we conceptualize race. Education Morning received her primary- and secondary- school education at the United Nations International School in New York City, where she graduated with an International Baccalaureate in 1986. She then earned her B.A. in Economics and Political Science at Yale University in 1990. As an undergraduate she also studied in Paris at the Institut d‚ÄôEtudes Politiques and Universit√© de Paris III (Censier-Daubenton) during the 1988‚Äì89 academic year. In 1992, she earned a Master‚Äôs in International Affairs from Columbia University‚Äôs School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), and then a Ph.D. in Sociology in 2004 at Princeton University, where she was affiliated with the Office of Population Research. Career Morning began her career in 1992 as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where she monitored the external debt burden of a portfolio of less- industrialized nations. In 1994, she joined the U.S. Department of State as a Foreign Service Officer, serving as Vice Consul at the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras and completed a temporary tour of duty at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York. She left the Foreign Service in late 1995 to become an Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs at her former graduate school, Columbia University‚Äôs School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). She remained at SIPA until beginning her doctoral studies at Princeton in the fall of 1997. At Princeton, Morning was a student at the Office of Population Research, and her first research projects focused on the uses of racial classification in demographic data like censuses. In particular, she undertook quantitative analyses of the classification of groups that did not easily fit traditional American racial categories, such as mixed-race people and people of South Asian descent. With time, she developed an interest in individuals‚Äô beliefs about the nature of racial difference, using the term ‚Äúracial conceptualization‚Äù to get at the web of their interrelated beliefs about which groups constituted races, what demarcated them from each other, how they emerged, and how an individual‚Äôs membership in a racial group could be ascertained. Her doctoral dissertation explored such concepts using qualitative data, and went on to win the American Sociological Association‚Äôs Dissertation Award in 2005. In 2011, it was published by the University of California Press as The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach about Human Difference. While finishing up her doctoral dissertation, Morning worked as a consultant to the U.S. Census Bureau, gathering and analyzing data on census racial and ethnic enumeration on nearly 140 nations around the globe. After earning her doctorate in 2004, she joined New York University‚Äôs Department of Sociology as an Assistant Professor, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011. Since 2012, Morning has also been an Affiliated Faculty Member at NYU‚Äôs Abu Dhabi campus, teaching there regularly. And since 2013, she has been a member of the U.S. Census Bureau‚Äôs National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic and Other Populations. Ann Morning continues to work on racial classification, racial conceptualization, and their intersection with contemporary science. A Fulbright scholarship to the University of Milan-Bicocca in 2008-09 resulted in her current book project investigating Italians‚Äô beliefs about ethnic and racial difference, co- authored with sociologist Marcello Maneri of the University of Milan-Bicocca and due to be published by the Russell Sage Foundation.

Background It was premi√®red in Berlin in 1931 and has been filmed several times. Before the premi√®re, the German writer and playwright, Carl Zuckmayer nominated the play for the Kleist Prize, which it won, the most significant literary award of the Weimar Republic.http://www.heinrich-von- kleist.org/en/kleist-gesellschaft/kleist-prize/history/ The play's title is a reference to the waltz \\"Tales from the Vienna Woods\\" by Johann Strauss II. Horv√°th's play premi√®red at the Deutsches Theater, Berlin. Written in the late 1920s during the period of catastrophic unemployment and the Great Depression, the play is a key work of modern drama, described by Erich K√§stner as \\"a Viennese folk play accompanied by Viennese folk songs\\". It is a bitter satire about the mendacity and brutality of the petite-bourgeoisie, named ironically after the Vienna Woods near the Austrian capital that are so idealised in the waltz. In the play, Viennese Gem√ºtlichkeit or \\"coziness\\" becomes a hollow phrase; the tragic, brutal story of the sweet girl Marianne and the deeply conventional butcher Oskar reflects the hardships and anxieties of the late 1920s during the global economic crisis. The play is set in Wachau, Josefstadt, and the Vienna Woods just before the Austrofascist takeover. It tells the fate of a naive young woman, Marianne, who breaks off her reluctant engagement with Oskar after falling in love with a fop named Alfred who, however, has no serious interest in returning her love. For this error, she must pay bitterly. Werner Pirchner composed the incidental music to the play.  Adaptations  = Film = The play was filmed for cinematic release in 1961 by director , starring Johanna Matz (Marianne), Walter Kohut (Alfred), Helmuth Lohner, Hans Moser (reprising his role of Marianne's father from the 1931 Berlin premiere), Helmut Qualtinger (Oskar) and Jane Tilden (Valerie), among others. Another version was made for television in 1964, directed by Michael Kehlmann. A 1979 remake was undertaken by director Maximilian Schell, featuring (Marianne), Hanno P√∂schl (Alfred), Helmut Qualtinger (Zauberk√∂nig), Jane Tilden (Valerie), Adrienne Gessner (Alfred's Grandmother), G√∂tz Kauffmann (Oskar), Andr√© Heller (Hierlinger) and (Erich). *L√©gendes de la for√™t viennoise (1993) directed by *Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald (1999) directed by Martin Ku≈°ej *Geschichten aus dem Wienerwald (2013) directed by Herbert Fottinger and Andre Turnheim. = Opera = Tales from the Vienna Woods, a 2014 opera by composer HK Gruber to a libretto by Michael Sturminger.

Contemporaneous with the global Long Depression, Britain's agricultural depression was caused by the dramatic fall in grain prices that followed the opening up of the American prairies to cultivation in the 1870s and the advent of cheap transportation with the rise of steamships. British agriculture did not recover from this depression until after the Second World War.Alun Howkins, Reshaping Rural England. A Social History 1850-1925 (London: HarperCollins Academic, 1991), p. 138.David Cannadine, The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy (London: Pan, 1992), p. 92. Background In 1846 Parliament repealed the Corn Laws--which had imposed a tariff on imported grain--and thereby de facto instituted free trade. There was a widespread belief that free trade would lower prices immediately.Mancur Olson and Curtis C. Harris, ‚ÄòFree Trade in 'Corn': A Statistical Study of the Prices and Production of Wheat in Great Britain from 1873 to 1914‚Äô, in P. J.

However, this did not occur for about 25 years after repeal; the years 1853 to 1862 were famously described by Lord Ernle as the \\"golden age of English agriculture\\".Lord Ernle, English Farming Past and Present. Sixth Edition (Chicago: Quadrangle Books, 1961), p. 373. This period of prosperity was caused by rising prices due to the discovery of gold in Australia and California which encouraged industrial demand.Perren, p. 2. Grain prices dropped from 1848 to 1850 but went up again from 1853, with the Crimean War (1853-1856) and the American Civil War (1861-1865) preventing the export of cereals from Russia and the United States, thereby shielding Britain from the effects of free trade.Perren, p. 3.P. J. Perry, ‚ÄòEditor's Introduction‚Äô, British Agriculture 1875-1914 (London: Methuen, 1973), p. xix. Britain enjoyed a series of good harvests (apart from in 1860) and the area of land under cultivation expanded, with increasing land values and increasing investments in drainage and buildings.Perren, p. 3.Ernle, pp. 374-375. In the opinion of historian Robert Ensor, the technology employed in British agriculture was superior to most farming on the Continent due to more than a century of practical research and experimentation: \\"Its breeds were the best, its cropping the most scientific, its yields the highest\\".R. C. K. Ensor, England 1870-1914 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1936), p. 117. Ernle stated that \\"crops reached limits which production has never since exceeded, and probably, so far as anything certain can be predicted of the unknown, never will exceed\\".Ernle, p. 375. Causes of the Depression An 1884 drawing of an American farmer with a reaper-binder. In 1862 the United States Congress passed the Homestead Act which led to the settlement of a large part of the Midwest.H. M. Conacher, ‚ÄòCauses of the Fall of Agricultural Prices between 1875 and 1895‚Äô, in P. J. Perry (ed.), British Agriculture 1875-1914 (London: Methuen, 1973), p. 22. The United States also witnessed a great increase in railways, mainly across the prairies. In 1860 the United States possessed about 30,800 miles of railways; by 1880 this had increased to about 94,200 miles. The railway companies encouraged farmer-settlers by promising to transport their crops for less than cost for a number of years.Ensor, p. 115. Due to the technological progress of shipping, there was for the first time plenty of cheap steam ships to transport their crops across the seas. This drove down transport costs: in 1873 the cost of transporting a ton of grain from Chicago to Liverpool was ¬£37s., in 1880 it was ¬£21s. and in 1884 ¬£14s.Ensor, p. 115. New inventions in agricultural machinery also aided the American prairie farmer. Due to the scarcity of hired farm labourers, prairie farmers had to collect their own harvest and the limit of their expansion was set by what one pair of hands could do. The advent of the reaper-binder in 1873 revolutionised harvesting because it meant the doubling of every farmer's crop as it enabled the reaping to be worked by one man instead of two.Ensor, pp. 115-116. For these reasons, cheap imports of vast amounts of American prairie wheat were able to flood the market and undercut and overwhelm British wheat farmers.Ensor, p. 115. The bad harvests of 1875, 1877, 1878 and particularly the wet summer of 1879 disguised the cause of the depression.Perry, p. xix, p. xxiii.Perren, p. 7.Howkins, p. 138, p. 140. The Duke of Bedford wrote in 1897 that \\"Agriculturalists and the nation at large were alike insensible to the real character of the depression...Cheap marine transport had already thrown open the English market to the cereals of four continents...It is easy to be wise after the event, but it is strange that a catastrophe which was no longer merely impending but had actually taken place should have been regarded by those best able to judge as a passing cloud\\".The Duke of Bedford, The Story of a Great Agricultural Estate (London: John Murray, 1897), p. 181. In previous seasons of bad harvests, farmers were compensated by high prices caused by the scarcity.Perren, p. 7.Perry, p. xviii. However, British farmers could no longer rely on high prices due to the cheap American imports.Ensor, p. 116. Effects Between 1871‚Äì75 and 1896‚Äì1900, the importation of wheat and flour increased by 90%, for meat it was 300% and for butter and cheese it was 110%.Fletcher, p. 33. The price of wheat in Britain declined from 56s 0d a quarter in 1867‚Äì71 to 27s 3d in 1894‚Äì98.Fletcher, p. 34. The nadir came in 1894‚Äì95, when prices reached their lowest level for 150 years, 22s. 10d.Ernle, p. 385. On the eve of the depression, the total amount of land growing cereals was ; by 1898 this had declined to , a decline of about 22%. During the same period, the amount of land under permanent pasture rather than under cultivation increased by 19%.Howkins, p. 146. By 1900 wheat-growing land was only a little over 50% of the total of 1872 and shrank further until 1914.Ensor, p. 285. The depression also accelerated Britain's rural depopulation. The 1881 census showed a decline of 92,250 agricultural labourers since 1871, with an increase of 53,496 urban labourers. Many of these had previously been farm workers who migrated to the cities to find employment.Ensor, p. 117. Between 1871 and 1901 the population of England and Wales increased by 43% but the proportion of male agricultural labourers decreased by over one-third.Ensor, pp. 285-286. According to Sir James Caird in his evidence to the Royal Commission on the Depression in Trade and Industry in 1886, the annual income of landlords, tenants and labourers had fallen by ¬£42,800,000 since 1876.Ernle, p. 381. No other country witnessed such a social transformation and British policy contrasted with those adopted on the Continent.Perren, p. 24. Every wheat- growing country imposed tariffs in the wake of the explosion of American prairie wheat except Britain and Belgium.Ensor, p. 116. Subsequently, Britain became the most industrialised major country with the smallest proportion of its resources devoted to agriculture.Olson and Harris, p. 149. Britain's dependence on imported grain during the 1830s was 2%; during the 1860s it was 24%; during the 1880s it was 45% (for corn it was a whopping 65%).Ensor, p. 116. By 1914 Britain was dependent on imports for four-fifths of her wheat and 40% of her meat.Arthur Marwick, The Deluge: British Society and the First World War. Second Edition (London: Macmillan, 1991), p. 58. =Social effects= Between 1809 and 1879, 88% of British millionaires had been landowners; between 1880 and 1914 this figure dropped to 33% and fell further after the First World War.Cannadine, p. 91. During the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century, the British landed aristocracy were the wealthiest class in the world's richest country.Cannadine, p. 90. In 1882 Charles George Milnes Gaskell wrote that \\"the vast increase in the carrying power of ships, the facilities of intercourse with foreign countries, [and] the further cheapening of cereals and meat\\" meant that economically and politically the old landed class were no longer lords of the earth.Cannadine, p. 90. The new wealthy elite were no longer British aristocrats but American businessmen, such as Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew W. Mellon, who made their wealth from industry rather than land.Cannadine, p. 90. By the late nineteenth century, British manufacturers eclipsed the aristocracy as the richest class in the nation. As Arthur Balfour stated in 1909: \\"The bulk of the great fortunes are now in a highly liquid state...They do not consist of huge landed estates, vast parks and castles, and all the rest of it\\".Cannadine, p. 91. Responses The Prime Minister at the outset of the depression, Benjamin Disraeli, had once been a staunch upholder of the Corn Laws and had predicted ruin for agriculture if they were repealed.William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, The Life of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield. Volume II. 1860‚Äì1881 (London: John Murray, 1929), p. 1242.Robert Blake, Disraeli (London: Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1966), p. 698. However, unlike most other European governments, his government did not revive tariffs on imported cereals to save their farms and farmers.Ensor, p. 54. Despite calls from landowners to reintroduce the Corn Laws, Disraeli responded by saying that the issue was settled and that protection was impracticable.Blake, p. 698. Ensor claimed that the difference between Britain and the Continent was due to the latter having conscription; rural men were thought to be the best suited as soldiers, but for Britain, with no conscript army, that did not apply.Ensor, p. 54. He also claimed that Britain staked its future on continuing to be \\"the workshop of the world\\", as the leading manufacturing nation.Ensor, p. 118. Robert Blake claimed that Disraeli was dissuaded from reviving protection because the urban working class was enjoying cheap imported food at a time of industrial depression and rising unemployment. Enfranchised by Disraeli in 1867, working men's votes were crucial in a general election and he did not want to antagonise them.Blake, pp. 698-699. However, Disraeli's government appointed a Royal Commission on agricultural depression. It attributed the depression to bad harvests and foreign competition.Ernle, p. 380.Fletcher, p. 45. Its final report of 1882 recommended changing the burden of local taxation from real property to the Consolidated Fund and the setting up of a government department for agriculture.Fletcher, p. 46. The new government, a Liberal administration under William Ewart Gladstone, did little.Fletcher, p. 46. Lord Salisbury's government founded the Board of Agriculture in 1889.Fletcher, p. 46. After a series of droughts in the early 1890s, Gladstone's government appointed another Royal Commission into the depression in 1894. Its final report found foreign competition as the main cause in the fall in prices. It recommended changes in land tenure, tithes, education and other minor items.Ensor, p. 286.

It stars Jim Sturgess as Los Angeles-based bank robber Eddie Dodson, who robbed 64 banks in 1983 before he was caught. It premiered at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival and received a limited theatrical release in April 2015.  Plot  Eddie Dodson borrows money from the bank to finance a stylish furniture shop that doubles as a nightclub. When he is unable to pay back the loans, he turns to loan shark Roy Fortune. After his upper-class girlfriend, Charlotte, dumps him, Dodson steals an expensive vase from his friend Tina and pawns it for a starting pistol. While at a nightclub, he meets Pauline. She insists he give her a ride, and they begin dating after bonding over their love of trendy Los Angeles punk music. Dodson confides in her that he plans to rob a bank. The next morning, Dodson follows through on his plan. His stylish appearance and flirtatious behavior make an impression on the bank teller, and she does not set off the alarm until he leaves. The investigating police officers, Detectives Holiday and Mercury, have little to go on besides his expensive fashion sense. Although frustrated with his limited take, Dodson uses the money to slowly begin paying back Fortune. Impressed that Dodson has pulled off the robbery, Pauline eventually becomes his getaway driver. She suggests that he is not really stealing from people if he provides them with a service. Dodson targets female tellers, whom he compliments as he demands the money. Dodson hits banks all over Beverly Hills and Hollywood, Los Angeles, funneling most of the money to pay off Fortune. However, during one of his robberies, the teller includes a dye pack, which explodes in his car. After another robbery, Tina recognizes him and engages him in conversation before he can leave the bank. When she invites him to a party, he leaves in her car, abandoning Pauline. The police discover Dodson's car in the bank's parking lot and issue a warrant for his arrest based on the dye splashed in it. However, the teller backs out of identifying him in a line-up. With no other evidence, the police release him. Pauline does not return home. When Dodson begins spending the money to feed his lavish lifestyle, Fortune threatens to kill him. After Dodson pulls his starting pistol, an enraged Fortune forces him to commit another bank robbery under the eye of his thugs. The teller's supervisor is uncooperative and calls Dodson's bluff, but Dodson intimidates the teller into handing over the money. As Dodson runs from the bank, the supervisor chases him; Dodson eludes both the thugs and the supervisor. At his house, Pauline, who has finally returned, says she has already told the police everything, as she no longer loves him, though she quickly contradicts herself by saying the police do not know of her existence. The police surround the house, and Dodson first imagines suicide by cop before, in reality, being arrested by Det. Mercury, who recognizes the starting pistol as fake.

Release  Electric Slide premiered at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival. Foreign distribution of the film caused an arbitration case after Osiris Entertainment said that the production company, Myriad Pictures, secretly allowed the film to be distributed in territories known for rampant piracy. After the film was pirated and went viral, Osiris Entertainment demanded a discount. The dispute was resolved confidentially in August 2015. Paragon Pictures gave it a limited theatrical release in the U.S. in April 2015.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 14% of seven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3/10. Metacritic rated it 37/100 based on six reviews. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called it a dull film that \\"never manages to achieve the dramatic tension or satiric social commentary to which it aspires\\". Though he complimented the film's attention to period detail, Ernest Hardy of The Village Voice wrote, \\"The film itself, despite being based on a larger-than- life true story, is limp and anemic.\\" Wes Greene of Slant Magazine rated it 2/4 stars and called the film style over substance. Rodrigo Perez of Indiewire rated it D‚àí and wrote, \\"Tiresomely told, uninteresting, and turgid, Electric Slide is as insipid as it gets ‚Äî a meaningless movie about almost nothing at all.\\" Brian Orndorf of Bluray.com awarded the film 3/10 and wrote, \\"The only performer who registers with unpredictability is Lambert, making a rare screen appearance as a hot-headed kingpin surrounded by bikini-clad women.

Achievements  Norwich City FC and Chief Executive David McNally have met with group representatives and on three occasions the group has paraded on the pitch at half time. National anti-discrimination organization Kick It Out (organisation) invited Proud Canaries to deliver workshops at a Pride In Football and Football v Homophobia event in London 2014. The Football Association invited the group to Wembley to watch the England‚ÄìSlovenia game 15 November 2014 and the Proud Canaries banner was hung alongside those of other LGBT fan groups to demonstrate their commitment to fighting prejudice. Chief Executive David McNally is working with the group and indicates the club is fully committed to combating any homophobia at Carrow Road. They routinely display the Stonewall 'Some People Are Gay - Get Over It' in club colours on the scoreboard and all stewards have been trained to deal with homophobic incidents; in conjunction with the police if necessary. In addition, the club endorse reporting of discriminatory behaviour through the Kick It Out app. At the end of the 2014/15 season Kick It Out awarded NCFC their Equality Standard to recognise their work in promoting equality and tackling discrimination citing their connection with Proud Canaries as an example of good practice. During the 2014/15 season Norwich City CFC received 4 reports of homophobia at Carrow Road ‚Äì the outcomes of the investigations was that offenders received final warnings and were informed that any repetition would lead to banning. Some campaigners have suggested that the club is not applying a zero tolerance policy by not dealing with offences with summary and permanent exclusion. Proud Canaries position on the issue is that homophobic abuse in English football has generally been tolerated and ignored and that some supporters need a little time and encouragement to process the change in expectations of other fans and club officers.

The Svecofennian orogen is shown in yellow. The blue areas to the west are the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt. The nappes emplaced by the much younger Caledonian orogeny are shown in light green. The Svecofennian orogeny is a series of related orogenies that resulted in the formation of much of the continental crust in what is today Sweden and Finland plus some minor parts of Russia. The orogenies lasted from about 2000 to 1800 million years ago during the Paleoproterozoic Era. The resulting orogen is known as the Svecofennian orogen or Svecofennides. To the west and southwest the Svecofennian orogen limits with the generally younger Transscandinavian Igneous Belt. It is assumed that the westernmost fringes of the Svecofennian orogen have been reworked by the Sveconorwegian orogeny just as the western parts of the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt has. The Svecofennian orogeny involved the accretion of numerous island arcs in such manner that the pre- existing craton grew with this new material from what is today northeast to the southwest. The accretion of the island arcs was also related to two other processes that occurred in the same period; the formation of magma that then cooled to form igneous rocks and the metamorphism of rocks. Development of the orogeny The Svecofennian orogeny developed as a succession of four orogenies which by chronological order are: the Lapland-Savo orogeny, the Fennian orogeny, the Svecobaltic orogeny and the Nordic orogeny. In broad terms, regardless of details, it has been proposed that the Svecofennian orogeny involved more-less continuous subduction with subduction zones progressively migrating to the southwest. An alternative model postulates subduction included alternating extension and compression cycles, with the orogenic activity ceasing after the collision between the Fennoscandian Craton and the Sarmatian Craton. =Lapland-Savo orogeny= Prior to the onset of orogeny the Archean-aged craton of what is today northeastern Fennoscandia rifted creating an ocean basin, the \\"pre-Svecofennian Ocean\\", that then closed during the Svecofennian orogeny. The closure of this basin was indebted to subduction and resulted thus both in the formation of igneous rocks and the emplacement of the Jormua and Outokumpu ophiolites about 1950 million years ago. In the later stages of the Lapland-Savo orogeny an island arc, the Knaften arc, accreted to the Keitele-Karelia-Norrbotten collage. =Fennian orogeny= The stage to the Fennian orogeny was set by a collision between Keitele and Karelia about 1920‚Äì1910 million years ago which resulted in a reorganization of the local plate tectonics. As concequence the Bergslagen microcontinents collided with the Keitele‚ÄìKarelia collage starting the Fennian orogeny. The until then linear Fennian orogen was \\"buckled\\" from 1870 million years ago onwards due to an orthogonal change in tectonic compressive stress. This resulted in various oroclines around the Gulf of Bothnia. =Svecobaltic orogeny= Prior to the Svecobaltic orogeny proper there was period of northward-directed subduction at what is now south-central Sweden and southern Finland. The subduction lasted from 1860 to 1840 million years ago and was accompanied by magmatic activity. Two trends in the southern Svecofennian orogen variously overlapped in time and space: extension (1870 to 1840 million years ago) and continent-continent collision (1870 to 1790 million years ago). Magmatic activity and metamorphism in southern Finland ended gradually after 1870 million years ago. The orogen at southern Finland with its presumed mountains and thick continental crust collapsed under the influence of gravity and spread out. By 1850 million years ago this collapse had evolved to a dynamic of extensional tectonics. In this extensional milieu short-lived sedimentary basins formed. The Svecobaltic orogeny developed when subduction bought the Fennoscandian Craton into an oblique collision with the Sarmatian Craton. The mentioned sedimentary basins were destroyed by basin inversion 1830 million years ago. This last event of basin inversion was associated with a period of metamorphism in southern Finland that peaked about 1820 million years ago. =Nordic orogeny and later development= Two models exist regarding the origin of the Nordic orogeny: one proposes it as an Andean-type orogeny with subduction but no accretion or continental collision and the other poses it might have resulted from the collision of the Fennoscandian Craton with the Amazonia continent. The Svecofennian orogen underwent a gravitational collapse from 1790 to 1770 million years ago. The late magmatism following the orogeny overlaps in time with the early magmatism of the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt. This magmatism was largely the result of anatexis forming migmatites and large plutons. Another characteristic of the late magmatism is the apparent lack of mafic and intermediate compositions among the magmas, which are nearly all felsic. Features of the orogen =Tectonostratigraphic units= Map showing the large-scale geological units of Finland. The Svecofennian orogen (4) is shown in violet blue. The Older Karelian Domain (3) is orange coloured. Areas younger than the Svecofennian orogen are in white. Geologist Baltybaev (2013) have identified the following terranes as composing the Svecofennian orogen (parenthesis indicate location): Skellefte√• Terrane (Skellefte River Basin), Bothnian Terrane (V√§sternorrland and Ostrobothnia), Pyh√§salmi Terrane (Northern Savonia), Central Terrane (Central Finland), Western Terrane (G√§vleborg), Ladoga Terrane (southern Finland‚ÄìRussia border) and the Southern Terrane (Bergslagen and Southern Finland). Baltybaev further distinguishes between an outer zone in the northeast and an inner zone in the southwest. The inner zone is characterized by I-type calc-alkaline granitoids. In contrast the outer zone contains more S-type granitoids. There are differences between the metamorphosed sediments found in the two zones while the outer zone contains metagreywackes the inner zone hosts metapelites. Rocks of the outer zone are estimated to have formed 1890‚Äì1860 million years ago and granitoids of the inner zone 1840‚Äì1790 million years ago. In addition to those two zones Baltybaev identifies a narrow zone of conjugation with Archean complexes between the outer zone and the Archean craton to the north and east. Nironen and M√§ntt√§ri (2012) uses the terms Central Svecofennian terrane and Southern Svecofennian terrane for approximately the same areas Baltybaev calls outer and inner zone respectively. The Oskarshamn-J√∂nk√∂ping belt is a granitoid region of the Svecofennian orogen completely surrounded by rocks of Transscandinavian Igneous Belt. As the name implies the Oskarshamn-J√∂nk√∂ping belt runs as sliver from the vicinity of Oskarshamn northwest to the J√∂nk√∂ping area. It has been proposed that the Oskarshamn-J√∂nk√∂ping belt continues beneath the East European Platform in Lithuania. =Major faults and sutures= The boundary of the Svecofennian orogen with the Archean \\"Kola-Karelian orogen\\" to the northwest is made up by the Lule√•-Kuopio suture zone. The dextral South Finland Shear Zone runns across much of southern Finland in a west‚Äìeast direction.

After the regional and municipal elections of 1987, the PRC won five seats in the Regional Assembly of Cantabria and two town councilors in the city of Santander. Internal party strife culminated in the abandonment of the organization by the two councilors of Santander (Miguel P√©rez Bustamante and √Ångel D√≠az Ocejo), as well as by the deputy of the Regional Assembly Esteban Solana Lav√≠n.

She has danced throughout the world with such legends as Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov earning prizes for her performances from France, Italy, Monaco, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the United States. Biography Ana Maria Laguna Caso was born 16 May 1954 in Zaragoza, Spain. Laguna grew up in Spain, beginning her ballet studies with Maria de Avila and by age eighteen was dancing at the Real Ballet de C√°mara (The Royal Chamber Ballet). In 1973, she was offered work at the Cullberg Ballet in Sweden and was soon starring in many productions of the company. Her breakthrough performance to international recognition occurred in the 1976 production of St. George and the Dragon by the choreographer Mats Ek, whom she later married. In the 1980-1981 season, she performed with Nederlands Dans Theater, but returned to Cullberg for the opportunity to dance in two works she had long coveted, Sonate √† Trois by B√©la Bart√≥k and choreographed by Maurice B√©jart and Miss Julie by Ture Rangstr√∂n and choreographed by Birgit Cullberg. Though she had only two and a half weeks to learn Miss Julie, her performance with Rudolf Nureyev was one of her career highlights. Other high-profile roles include the title role in Ek's Giselle (1982), which was created by him for her and for which she also received the French Video Dance Prize for the best interpretation of Giselle in a TV version. Carmen was another of the dancer's favorite roles to perform for which she won an Emmy Award. In 1993, she left Cullberg's company and began working independently. In 2001, her performance of Andromaque earned critical acclaim. She has danced throughout the world in performances with Mikhail Baryshnikov and worked in many productions including film, television and live dance, as well as serving as a choreographic assistant with a variety of companies and countries such as Nederlands Dans Theater and the Spanish National Dance Company, as well as with her husband. She has worked as a professor, on the Swedish National Council for Dance Education, and in 2006 was the first dancer outside the Royal Ballet to be appointed as an official Court Dancer.

Metzner was a German-born pharmacist from Lorach, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, who immigrated to the United States in 1856 and served as a captain in the Union Army, 32nd Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, during the American Civil War. Metzner co-founded the Metzner and Hatt Tile Company around 1880 at Hamilton, Ohio, and served as its vice president for more than ten years; in 1884 the company was renamed the Hamilton Tile Works. In 1900 he helped reestablish the C. Pardee Works at Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Metzner died in 1918 and is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana. Early life and education Metzner was born on August 16, 1834, in the village of Lorach, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. He attended the University of Freiburg in the Grand Duchy of Baden, Germany, where he earned a degree as a pharmacist. Metzner immigrated to the United States in 1856 and entered into a business partnership as a druggist with Henry J. Stein in Louisville, Kentucky. Military service In August 1861 Metzner traveled to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he enlisted for three years of service in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Metzner helped organize Lieutenant Colonel Francis \\"Frank\\" Erdelmeyer's Turner Company, a part of the 32nd Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, also known as Indiana's 1st German Regiment because most of its members were of German descent.Peake, pp. 2, 14‚Äì18, 18, 21‚Äì22. Metzner was named First Lieutenant, Company A, 32nd Indiana, effective May 19, 1862; he was promoted to captain on February 4, 1863, and transferred to Company K. During Metzner's term of service from August 1861 until September 1864, his infantry regiment was attached to the first Army of the Ohio and the Army of the Cumberland, and served in the Western Theater. Metzner and his regiment left Camp Morton in Indianapolis in September 1861 and was ordered to Camp Nevin, Kentucky, in mid-October. The 32nd Indiana's major engagements included the Battle of Rowlett's Station (December 17, 1861), the second day at the Battle of Shiloh (April 7, 1862), and the Battle of Stones River (December 30‚Äì31, 1862, and January 1‚Äì3, 1863). The 32nd Indiana also participated in the Tullahoma Campaign (June 22‚ÄìJuly 7, 1863) and the Chickamauga Campaign (August 16‚ÄìSeptember 22, 1863), including the Battle of Chickamauga (September 19‚Äì20), where Metzner was shot in his right leg. The 32nd Indiana also took part in the Chattanooga Campaign (September 24‚ÄìNovember 23, 1864) and joined William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign (May 1‚ÄìSeptember 8, 1864).Peake, p. 39‚Äì42 and 44‚Äì45. The regiment's three-year enlisted men mustered out of service at Indianapolis on September 7, 1864.Peake, p. 45.Dyer, p. 990. Metzner's graphite and ink wash depiction of a view inside a Confederate fortification at Resaca, Georgia (Battle of Resaca) Metzner, who achieved the rank of captain during the war, maintained a visual record of his experiences with the 32nd Indiana through numerous sketches. His illustrations included the daily life of the Union soldiers during training, in camp, and in battle. When artists' supplies were unavailable in the field, Metzner used materials such as scraps of cardboard instead of canvas. His training as a pharmacist also may have provided him with the knowledge to produce tints for his drawings from natural sources such as berries and bark. After the Battle of Stones River, Metzner was assigned as a topographical engineer with the 2nd Division, Army of the Cumberland, where artists' materials were more readily available for sketching during his idle hours. Upon his return to Indianapolis in 1864, Metzner created at least one oil painting from his wartime sketches. An by oil on canvas scene of artillerymen in battle was Metzner's last known work before he pursued other interests.Peake, pp. 2‚Äì3. Marriage and family Metzner's first wife, Louise Reutti, suffered from kidney disease and died on January 27, 1877; he married his second wife, Emma Hess, on August 16, 1880, at Indianapolis.Peake, pp. 3 and 5. At the time of his death in 1918, Metzner was survived by his wife, Emma, and six of his children. One son, Adolph, from his first marriage, died in infancy.Peake, p. 6. Career After completion of his military service in 1864, Metzner returned to civilian life at Indianapolis. In 1865 he partnered with Frank Erdelmeyer, his former Union Army commander, to open A. Metzner and Company, a local pharmacy. In 1868 Metzner sold his interest in the business to Erdelmeyer, and opened another drugstore closer to his home. Around the same time, Metzner became interested in developing glazes for pottery and tile as a hobby. Following his first wife's death in 1877, Metzner left the pharmacy business, but continued his work on developing glazes and ceramic artwork. Around 1880 Metzner learned through his family friends that the Royal Pottery Company in Hamilton, Ohio, was for sale. With a partner he purchased the company, its stock, and kilns, to found the Metzner and Hatt Tile Company, and relocated with his family to Hamilton. In partnership with Jacob Louis Bieler, an Indianapolis brewer, Metzner and his sons, Otto and Max, continued to perfect a technique to produce high quality enameled artistic tile and ceramic glazes. In 1884 Metzner and his new partners, Dr. Theodore Wild of Chicago, who served with Metzner in the military and bought Bieler's business interest, and Julius Bunsen, renamed their company the Hamilton Tile Works. Metzner served as the company's vice president for more than ten years. After the company's reorganization in 1897, Metzner left it to work for the American Encaustic Tiling Company in Zanesville, Ohio. In 1900, Metzner and his son, Max, helped reestablish the C. Pardee Works, a decorative tile manufacturer in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The New Jersey firm later acquired the Grueby Faience Company of Boston.Peake, p. 5‚Äì6. Later years and legacy Metzner retired from business in 1912, and moved to Bayonne, New Jersey; he died at home on February 13, 1918, at the age of 83. Metzner's remains were returned to Indianapolis, where he was interred at Crown Hill Cemetery. Metzner's business ventures contributed to the development of glazes for ceramic tile-relief panels, which were popular decorative items in Victorian-era America. His American Civil War sketches of the 32nd Indiana Infantry Regiment in camp, on the march, and in battle were published in Blood Shed in This War by the Indiana Historical Society in 2010, and provide a visual, firsthand account of his impressions of the people, places, and major events his regiment experienced during the war.

The building was designed by Mehrdad Yazdani of CannonDesign and offers services for stroke care, cardiac surgery, and vascular services. Project costs were approximately $290,000,000. Building design The first four floors of this 10-story 476,000 square feet vertical campus, house the Gates Vascular Institute, with the Clinical and Translational Research Center occupying the top half of the building. The facility‚Äôs structure and its engineering systems are based on the \\"Universal Grid,\\" a minimally invasive approach to future modifications built into the building fabric intended to accommodate future changes. By adopting the Universal Grid approach, different spaces throughout the facility become capable of supporting a variety of functions. The Universal Grid consists of three 10‚Äô-6\\" building modules that create a 31‚Äô-6\\" X 31‚Äô-6\\" structural grid‚Äîin conjunction with an 18‚Äô floor-to-floor height. The Universal Grid's open plan is easily adaptable to changing equipment and service offerings. This approach facilities the installation of new technologies and conversion of building zones, as future needs determine, to entirely different functions without the modification of core infrastructure systems (mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems). The combined buildings of the Gates Vascular Institute and Buffalo General Medical Center house a new emergency department, a new helipad, 610 beds, 28 operating rooms, 17 interventional labs, four CT scanners and four MRIs. Awards The Gates Vascular Institute won the 2013 AIA Healthcare Design Award Recipient from the American Institute of Architects. The jury stated the building \\"possesses unique design and planning concepts that demonstrate a great deal of innovation. It is really well integrated, highly thoughtful design. The forms are expressive of the collaboration that is to take place here. It clearly expresses an idea. This project begins to push the boundaries of hospital programming and the isolation of function based spaces. By appropriating some lessons from an activity based workplace the team creates overlapping and shared spaces to challenge conventional hierarchies in health center planning.\\" See also *Architecture of Buffalo, New York *Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus *Kaleida Health *CannonDesign *List of tallest buildings in Buffalo References External links Skyscraperpage building page * Emporis building page Category:Hospitals in New York (state) Category:Skyscrapers in Buffalo, New York Category:Skyscrapers in New York (state) Category:Healthcare in Buffalo, New York ","title":"Gates Vascular Institute"},{"id":"47682980","title":"Giovanna Galletti"},{"id":"47682987","text":"Cara Black and Lisa Raymond were the defending champions, but did not compete this year.

The barrier consisted of minefields laid between Belgium and Dover at the outbreak of war, followed in February 1915 by steel netting anchored to the sea bed. The first stage of the barrage was completed in April 1915 and it was patrolled by ships of the Dover patrol. Both sides initially believed the barrier to be effective and the Germans attributed some losses to it. However, in March 1916, the Germans found their submarines could traverse the Channel on the surface at night. The British moved the barrier to cover Folkestone-Cap Gris Nez and used new mines and searchlights, effectively closing the Channel to hostile submarines in August 1918. Underwater scanning of the area covered by the Dover Barrage shows the wreck of SM UB-109 broken in half. A mine barrage was also used in Dover during the 1940 Siege of Calais.

Born in Rhode Island, he settled in Minneapolis in 1874. Characterized as a \\"tycoon\\" and \\"robber baron,\\" Menage earned a fortune developing land on the city's borders into residential housing and financing the mortgages to enable people to buy his properties. During the 1870s and 1880s, he developed large areas of South Minneapolis including much of the area around Lake Calhoun and Lake Harriet. He also developed a luxury resort on Lake Calhoun and built a corporate headquarters which was at the time the city's tallest skyscraper. After a costly legal battle over a real estate deal with William S. King and the financial downturn of the Panic of 1893, Menage's real estate empire collapsed and he fled the country to avoid prosecution on charges of embezzlement. The charges against Menage were eventually dropped after several key witnesses had died or become hesitant to testify against him. He spent the later portion of his life working in real estate in the New York City area and never worked in Minnesota again. Early life Menage was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1850. His father, John Menage, was the descendant of French immigrants; his mother Mary was a descendant of Mayflower passenger John Howland. The family moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, when Menage was young. While Menage was in high school, his father died of tuberculosis, leaving Louis and his brother to take over the family's confectionery business. In 1871, a doctor diagnosed Menage with \\"weak lungs\\" and suggested he move west to avoid falling ill with tuberculosis himself. Menage moved to Minnesota shortly thereafter. After a brief time teaching classes in shorthand at a Minneapolis business school, he found work as a business clerk in Northern Minnesota at a logging camp near Pokegama Lake. Real estate empire In 1874, Menage returned to Minneapolis and entered the real estate business with partner H. C. Brackett. Menage gradually built an empire by purchasing farmland at the fringes of the city, platting and developing the property into residential neighborhoods, then financing the mortgages for people to purchase the homes. He also worked with Thomas Lowry, head of the city's streetcar system, to ensure that new lines were built to serve the outlying areas he was developing. Much of the present day Prospect Park neighborhood, and the areas surrounding Lake Harriet and Lake Calhoun, were developed by Menage and his companies. Photograph of the Lyndale Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota (c. 1883) A small inclusion in the title of every property Menage sold was a covenant stating that it would revert to Menage or his descendants if alcohol was ever sold there. Menage would release this covenant in exchange for a small cash payment.. This so- called \\"Menage forfeiture clause\\" remained in force on thousands of properties for decades. The cash payments to release it generated a significant side income for Menage and his successors. In 1937, the Minnesota Legislature passed a law nullifying the clause. On September 13, 1876 Menage married Amanda A. Bull, daughter of local businessman and Minneapolis pioneer Benjamin S. Bull. They had one daughter, Bessie (1877‚Äì1940). In June 1883, he opened the luxurious Lyndale Hotel near Lake Calhoun. One of the city's first luxury resorts, the hotel featured multi-room suites and luxurious common areas including a dining room, music hall and two verandas. The hotel's opening was celebrated with a gala attended by many of the city's leaders and elites. A streetcar was specially arranged to take guests back to Minneapolis after the night's festivities had ended. Lyndale Farm Menage ran into legal trouble with the purchase of a large plot of land south of Minneapolis known as \\"Lyndale Farm.\\" Owned by William S. King, the land had been placed in trust with New York financier Philo Remington in 1875 after King had fallen into financial trouble. Remington (joined later by a partner, Robert Innes) advanced King a sum of money in exchange for managing the land and seeing that it was developed or sold for a fair price. When King declared bankruptcy in 1877, Remington and Innes purchased the Lyndale Farm land from King for a token sum but promised to honor their previous agreement. Remington and Innes later met with Menage and, in 1882, devised a plan to sell King's land to Menage for development without telling King. Menage also negotiated a separate deal with Innes (likely behind Remington's back) where he agreed to pay him one-third of the profits made from the land as a finder's fee and in exchange for Innes' help keeping Remington and King at bay. Menage proceeded to develop the land into housing and profited handsomely. By 1885, King became aware of the scheme and retained lawyer John Van Voorhis to sue Menage. Menage claimed ignorance of the first agreement between King, Remington and Innes and asserted that he had purchased the property outright from the two. After a lengthy trial in Minnesota District Court, Menage lost and was ordered to return the land to King along with all proceeds from the development of the land. Menage appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1886, however the lower court's decision was upheld. The total amount Menage paid to King was approximately $2 million ($ million in ). While at the time Menage maintained he was not burdened by the judgment, he later recalled the protracted legal battle and subsequent loss \\"threatened bankruptcy and ruin.\\" Northwestern Guaranty Loan Company Northwestern Guaranty Loan Building (later Metropolitan Building), 1960s In 1889, Menage founded the Northwestern Guaranty Loan Company to handle the mortgage side of his real estate business. Among the members of the company's board were: John S. Pillsbury, William D. Washburn, Thomas Lowry, William Henry Eustis, Loren Fletcher, and many other important political and business figures. His real estate business was handled by a separate company called the Menage Realty Company. In 1890, Menage further cemented his place in the city by building the Northwestern Guaranty Loan Building (more commonly known as the Metropolitan Building), the city's tallest skyscraper, at a cost of more than $1 million ($ million in ). The building was home to all of Menage's various companies as well as other offices, a rooftop restaurant, and a private law library. While Minneapolis was the center of Menage's empire, he also owned land and property elsewhere in the Midwest and western states including Bozeman, Montana, Galveston, Texas, Gary, Indiana, and Madison, Wisconsin. Philanthropy Menage contributed to various charitable and philanthropic causes in Minneapolis. He donated funds toward the construction of the first Minneapolis Public Library building, provided a temporary home for the Ripley Memorial Hospital, and also sponsored a new bell in the First Baptist Church which he attended. In 1890, Menage sponsored a scientific expedition to the Philippines in partnership with the Minnesota Academy of Natural Sciences. The expedition, led primarily by Dean Conant Worcester and Frank Swift Bourns, collected thousands of specimens of birds and animals; some, such as the Philippine slow loris (Nycticebus menagensis) and the Sulu bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba menagei), were named in honor of Menage. While many of the specimens from the expedition appear to have been lost or discarded, some remain in the collections of the Bell Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum of Natural History. Financial collapse and later life In the early 1890s, Menage had begun to purchase land near Puget Sound in Washington, accumulating several thousand acres which he planned to develop into an iron mine, smelter and steel mill, along with housing for the workers. To finance the development he sold an early form of mortgage-backed security to investors in New England and Europe. When the Panic of 1893 occurred, investors found that Menage's properties were fraudulent. Many of the deeds were held by random names taken from the Minneapolis and Saint Paul telephone books, the properties themselves were unimproved, and the payments to investors were being made out of the bank's funds. His Northwestern Guaranty Loan Company (and, by the law of the era, its shareholders) were liable for the losses. Menage was indicted on charges of embezzlement but fled to Guatemala before a warrant for his arrest was issued. Menage's assistant, Donald Streeter, was tried twice but both trials ended with a hung jury. In an 1895 letter, Menage protested his innocence, blaming the Lyndale Farm lawsuit for hurting his finances and also noting (correctly) that: \\"the practice of using another's name on a note or mortgage is not unknown in the business world.\\" In 1899, the charges against Menage were dropped after several key witnesses had died and others appeared reluctant to testify. By some accounts Menage was present in the courtroom at the time; others suggest he never returned to Minneapolis. Menage spent the rest of his life living in New Jersey and working in real estate in the New York City area. He died in 1924. He is buried in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.

In 2018, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Partnership of Clinical Commissioning Groups was set up. Maggie MacIsaac is Chief Executive. History From 1947 to 1965 NHS services in Hampshire were managed by South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In 1965 a new board was formed for Wessex which covered Hampshire. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. Hampshire came under the Wessex RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Hampshire came under the South and West Regional Health Authority. Hampshire had an area health authority from 1974 until 1982 when it was divided into four district health authorities for Basingstoke and North Hampshire, Southampton and South West Hampshire, Winchester and Portsmouth and South East Hampshire. Basingstoke and North Hampshire and Winchester were amalgamated into North and Mid Hampshire District in 1994. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002. Hampshire was part of Hampshire and Isle of Wight SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Hampshire came under NHS South Central until that was abolished in 2013. There were three primary care trusts for the area: NHS Southampton City, NHS Hampshire, and NHS Portsmouth. Sustainability and transformation plans Hampshire and the Isle of Wight formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016 with Richard Samuel, the Chief Officer of Fareham and Gosport and South Eastern Hampshire Clinical Commissioning Groups as its leader It is proposed to cut 300 beds in the acute sector and to move some services from St Mary's hospital on the Isle of Wight to the mainland and to establish integrated primary care hubs with multiprofessional primary care teams with extended skills. Four clinical commissioning groups, North Hampshire, Fareham and Gosport, North East Hampshire and Farnham, and South Eastern Hampshire, formed a Partnership Board in May 2017 to deal with the Hampshire and Isle of Wight STP and the Frimley Health and Care System STP. Commissioning Care UK have a contract for elective treatment and urgent care services with Portsmouth CCG which was renewed for 5 years in September 2015. It is worth ¬£54.6 million. In 2018 the Isle of Wight CCG became part of the Hampshire CCG Partnership with Fareham and Gosport, North Hampshire, North East Hampshire and Farnham, and South Eastern Hampshire CCGs. Primary care There are 173 GP practices in the county. Out-of-hours services are provided by Hampshire Doctors on Call Service. GPs and community services in Portsmouth adopted a shared electronic health record system in October 2015. A practice-based pharmacist scheme established in West Hampshire in 2015 which employed 9.6 whole-time equivalent pharmacists and 2.2 pharmacy technicians reduced the cost of medication by conducting medication reviews. Savings were more than double the cost of the scheme. Acute services Acute services are provided by Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust and University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. Proposals made in 2015 for a new critical treatment hospital at North Waltham, Hampshire were not supported by the local clinical commissioning groups Joint Commissioners' Steering Group. Since 2008 there have been proposals to reorganise vascular services and to concentrate them in Southampton, but the Portsmouth trust has repeatedly objected. There are four hospitals in the county with accident and emergency facilities: Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital, the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Southampton General Hospital (a major trauma centre) and the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. In addition, Frimley Park Hospital is located just over the county border from Farnborough, and the Royal Bournemouth Hospital is closer to parts of the New Forest District than Southampton. Ambulance services are provided by South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), except in the northeast of the county, where it is provided by South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb). Mental health and community services Solent NHS Trust, Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust and Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust are the main providers of NHS mental health and community services. Vista Healthcare runs a low secure private hospital in Winchfield. The primary and acute care system in North East Hampshire and Farnham established a mental health cafe as a joint initiative which has reduced mental health hospital admissions by 33%. Millbrook Healthcare runs the wheelchair service.

She is the pioneer of the first day care centre in Benin City, oral history said she assisted Oba Ewuare in reclaiming the throne as Oba of Benin after several years in exile. Life Emotan (real name Uwaraye), was born in Eyaen between 1380 and 1400. After the death of her husband, she constructed a hut where she attended to the needs of children. Emotan was instrumental in Ewuare's reclaiming the throne as Oba of Benin after she told him of a murder plot against him made by Uwaifiokun and some chiefs during his time in exile. Ewuare went on to appoint Emotan as the Iyeki (English: leader of the authorized Ekpate guild), a position given to someone with the task of enforcing market rules and checkmating security matters. Deification After the death of Emotan, Oba Ewuare deified her by ordering the planting of the sacred Uruhe tree at the same spot where she used to display her wares. He went on to make a decree that homage must be paid to Emotan by persons who are celebrating any form of ceremonial gathering. Emotan Statue A life sized, bronze Emotan Statue was designed in honour of the legacy set by Emotan after two Uruhe trees, that were planted on separate occasions, fell. The statue was designed by John A. Danford and was unveiled by Oba Akenzua II in cooperation with the British Colonial authorities on May 20, 1954. The statue is presently located at the Oba Market in Benin City, Edo State.

Glyde was born the son of Elijah Glyde, a gentleman farmer of Waylord, Somerset and his wife Sarah, n√©e Dening or Denning. After working on his father's property for about 15 years he decided in 1866 to try his luck in South Australia, his brother S. D. Clyde having emigrated to New Zealand some five years earlier. Glyde and his wife arrived in South Australia in January 1867. He was an able writer, and shortly after arriving in Adelaide received an offer for employment with the Melbourne Argus, which he accepted and made his way to the sister colony of Victoria. He soon decided to return to Adelaide however, and went into business as a corn merchant, in 1873 joining forces with Sir William Morgan and Charles Hawkes Todd Connor as Morgan, Connor, and Glyde at 43 King William Street. His brother Samuel joined the company and later became a partner; Connor left in 1880. In 1882 they joined a consortium, the Adelaide Milling Company, with John Hart & Co., W. Duffield & Co., James Cowan & Co., and Harrold Brothers. This was the largest company registered in South Australia up to that time. William Dening Glyde was not actively involved in the new company, rather he set up a business with his son Edward as wheatbrokers and commission agents. He was a prominent member of the Congregational Church, and two of his ancestors were among the 2,000 ministers who in 1662 were ejected from the Church of England (\\"The Great Ejection\\") for refusing to accept the new prayer-book. He acted for many years as commercial editor of The Advertiser. He served as a member of the South Australian Legislative Council from May 1882 to June 1887; this was during the period when members were elected by the whole colony, acting as one electorate. Family William Dening Glyde married ; they lived at the corner of Ruthven Street (now Glyde Street, named for him) and Howard Street,Warburton, Elizabeth, The Paddocks Beneath, p. 255. (Glyde Street, Glen Osmond was named for the possibly unrelated Lavington Glyde). North Kensington.

The daughter of Eduard Joseph Glaser, a Roman Catholic, and Ella Cohn, a Jew, she was born Elisabeth Theresia Glaser in Friedenau, a suburb of Berlin, and grew up in Leipzig and Berlin. By the age of 20, she was writing poetry and short stories that were published in local newspapers. In 1933, she completed her first novel Der Ausgesto√üene (The outcast); it was accepted for publication but was not released due to the political environment in Germany at the time. Later that year, she left for the Netherlands. Her husband, Paul Felix Augustin, had grown up there and she already spoke Dutch. Her own Dutch translation of her first novel was published as De uitgestootene in 1935. She had published three more novels in Dutch by 1938. In 1938, her parents left Germany to join her in the Netherlands.

Plot In 1907 Jacob Rubinstein, a Russian Jew, leaves his village after it is attacked by cossacks. He heads for Hamburg, Germany, hoping that he can sail to America. While in Hamburg, he meets an African American called Roscoe Haines, who, after seeing his talent for playing Ragtime, encourages Jacob to go and see a music publisher called Abe Shulman in New York. When on the ship, Jacob meets an Italian from Sicily named Marco Santorelli. Marco had been the gardener for the English actress Maude Charteris. She wanted him to move to London with her but he refused as he wanted to go to America to make his fortune. One night during the crossing large numbers of the steerage class passengers dance on the ship's deck and Jacob and Marco meet and dance with two Irish sisters called Bridget and Georgiana O'Donnell. Bridget had been on the staff at Wexford Hall, the Irish home of the British landowner Jamie Barrymore the Earl of Wexford. Bridget, using the pseudonym of Mary-Ann Flaherty, had seduced the earl and assisted the Fenians in kidnapping Wexford. The same night Jacob has a brief conversation with a Czech called Tom Banicek. When the ship arrives in New York, Bridget is frustrated that while first and second class passengers just go straight to immigration, the steerage class passengers are all required to go through Ellis Island. Marco passes through with no problems, Jacob is treated for a gunshot wound that he had suffered during the trouble in his village. Bridget too is allowed in, but Georgiana is refused entry when she is diagnosed with trachoma an eye disease that can lead to blindness. Despite Bridget's criticism of the Ellis Island doctor Carl Travers, the decision is final, but the sisters' Uncle Casey, a powerful businessman, arranges for Georgiana to return to Ireland and then come back on another ship by second class as she wouldn't be checked that way. Tom Banicek, who has a cousin in New York, meets him on Ellis Island and translates for him when recruiters for the Staunton Mining Company based in Virginia try to employ him. Despite his cousin telling him that he would be poorly paid, would live in company housing which he would have to vacate if he ever left and that he could be fired for even mentioning joining a union, Tom says that he doesn't have a lot of choices for employment and that the conditions would be better than in the Austro-Hungarian Army which was the reason he came to America because he wants to avoid conscription. After two years of living in America, Marco has been working as a labourer and decides to borrow money off a loan shark, as he concludes that the only way to make real money is to be your own boss. After, he buys a horse and cart, being a delivery driver in direct competition with Casey O'Donnell, he crashes and destroys his cart. When he is unable to repay the loan shark, Marco is tortured. Desperate, Marco discovers that Maude Charteris is in New York performing a play. He goes to see her and she agrees to give him the money to buy a truck, clean clothes, and somewhere decent to live. In return, he is to become her lover, despite there being a large age difference between them. One day out on deliveries, Marco meets Georgiana, who has now gone blind. They start going on regular dates. Georgiana and Bridget's aunt however, disapproves and asks Casey to sort the issue, which he interprets as him using his influence to get Marco deported. After some counterfeit money is planted on his truck, Marco is taken to Ellis Island, to await a ship to take him back to Italy. A fellow inmate at the Ellis Island prison block tells Marco that he can help him escape. That night they break out and swim through New York Harbor. Marco stays in a hotel in New Jersey and asks Jacob to tell Georgiana that he will be gone for a while but he will return to her. When his relationship with Georgiana becomes serious, he goes to Maude to stop their affair. Maude also wants to stop as she is now engaged to Senator Phipps Ogden. Hoping that Maude could do him a favour, Marco travels to Long Island, in the hope that Maude and the senator will help solve his problem. Jacob meanwhile, has become a successful Broadway writer, after convincing Abe Shulman to give him a chance. Nellie Byfield, a rising star on Broadway, uses Jacob's feelings towards her to marry him, even having a child with him in order to further her career. Bridget, met Doctor Travers one day and apologises to him for the way that she spoke to him on Ellis Island. She says that her sister is now blind, as he diagnosed. He accepts her apology and after learning that she is a competent with a typewriter, offers her a job as his secretary on Ellis Island as he is now chief doctor there. Georgiana spends her time working at the New York Library for the Blind. She learns one day that Marco become engaged to Vanessa Ogden, the daughter of Senator Ogden. Marco hated himself for the way he treated Georgiana, but he decided that marrying Vanessa would be his ticket to high society. Senator Ogden approved of the engagement as he thought it might \\"tame\\" her. When they do get married, Marco makes regular trips to New York to see Georgiana, even though she senses that someone is watching her, Marco never tries to approach her. Marco and Vanessa's marriage produces a son, Frank. However, Vanessa refuses to sleep with Marco anymore. When Marco asks his father-in-law for his approval to run for the state senate, he agrees and thinks an Ellis Island immigrant would be the perfect candidate to go up against the Irish incumbent backed by Casey O'Donnell. When Vanessa makes an exhibition of herself at a party due to an alcohol problem, she is admitted to a hospital in Rhode Island, where she is befriended by an artist called Una Marbury. After the death of a miner, Tom Banicek attempts to organise all of his colleagues against the working conditions at the Staunton Mining Company. The owner Monty Staunton, refuses to listen and fires Tom immediately. Tom goes to Pennsylvania to talk to union management about getting union representatives in the mines. They explain that it could take a long time but they will eventually. When Jacob and Nellie's daughter dies, she reveals that she only married him for what he could do for her career. She also refuses to grant him a divorce even though she knows he is seeing another woman, Rebecca Weiler. When Jacob writes a play that a producer wants to make, Jacob says that the star of the show needs to be Flora Mitchum, the African American girlfriend of Roscoe Haines. The producer reluctantly agrees, and Jacob tells him that he can own 100% of the show if he agrees to cast Nellie in one of his Hollywood productions. When Nellie finds out about this, she grants Jacob a divorce as she wants to be in Hollywood pictures. Jacob marries Rebecca immediately. When Una and Vanessa leave the hospital they spend a lot of time together, eventually becoming lovers. When Senator Ogden arranges to pay Una $50,000 to leave his daughter and stop a scandal in his family, Vanessa kills Una and then commits suicide. Marco decides to go and see Georgiana after some reluctance she admits she still loves him and they marry. Marco is soon elected as the first Ellis Island immigrant on the New York State Senate. Meanwhile, Bridget has married Doctor Travers. One day at work she sees Denny Flynn a former colleague of hers at Wexford Hall. She fears that Denny will tell the authorities who she is and claim the reward money that the British Government is offering for information about the murder of Earl Wexford. Georgiana however, tells her that Marco can sort it and that he won't be deported or face any charges.

He is recognized as one of the most important Chinese artists since the 1990s. Born in Shanghai and educated in Shanghai and Paris, Chen suffered from autoimmune hemolytic anemia and died at age 45. He was the brother of Chen Zhu, a vice chairman of the National People's Congress of China. Biography Chen Zhen was born in 1955 to a family of doctors in Shanghai, China. He grew up in the former Shanghai French Concession during the tumultuous decade of the Cultural Revolution. He studied at Shanghai Fine Arts and Crafts School, and later at Shanghai Drama Institute (now Shanghai Theatre Academy), specializing in stage design. In 1982 he became a professor at Shanghai Drama Institute. When he was 25, Chen was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and was told he might have only five years to live. As China loosened travel restrictions in the 1980s, he left Shanghai in 1986 for Paris, France, where he studied art at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts and the Institut des Hautes √âtudes en Arts Plastiques (IHEAP). He supported himself by drawing portraits on the street. From 1993 to 1995 Chen was a professor at IHEAP in Paris, and from 1995 to 1999 he taught at the √âcole nationale des beaux-arts in Nancy. Chen died of cancer in Paris on 13 December 2000. He is buried in the 28th division of the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Works and exhibitions Although his career was cut short by disease, Chen had achieved international fame by the time he died. His mature work, created in the last decade of his life, explored \\"synergy\\" between different cultural and political environments. He is also known for using furniture and antique Chinese materials in his constructions. His large- scale works, exploring the topics of health and homeland, were well received globally. He held more than 30 solo shows in Europe, Asia, and America. After his death, memorial exhibitions were held at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, MoMA PS1 in New York City, as well as in Greece and Italy. Despite his fame abroad, as of 2015 there have been only two solo exhibitions of his works in his native Shanghai. The first was held at the Shanghai Art Museum in 2006, and the second at the Rockbund Art Museum (2015). The latter was curated by Hou Hanru, artistic director of the MAXXI in Rome. =La Danse de la fontaine √©mergente= Chen Zhen's last major work was the monumental fountain La Danse de la fontaine √©mergente in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. He died when the work was still a sketch. His widow Xu Min (ÂæêÊïè), who is also an artist and Chen's close collaborator, spent seven years completing the work of great technical complexity. The installation, which has water circulating at high pressure within a stylized dragon and is illuminated at night, was inaugurated in 2008. Family Chen Zhen's father Chen Jialun (ÈôàÂÆ∂‰º¶) and mother Xu Manyin (ËÆ∏ÊõºÈü≥) are both prominent doctors and medical professors in Shanghai. He was the youngest of three children.

He was a native of Sherborn, Massachusetts, and the ninth child of Richard and Deborah Sanger, a prominent colonial New England family. During the Revolutionary War he attained the rank of 1st Lieutenant having fought in the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Siege of Boston (1776), and during the New York Campaign. After the war, he settled in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, where he began farming, trading, and running a tavern. He was involved in several civic activities and was appointed Lt. Colonel of the New Hampshire militia. After a fire destroyed his property, leaving him bankrupt, he started over in the frontier of New York. Sanger settled in what was then called Whitestown. He became a land agent or speculator, buying large tracts of land on both sides of Sauquoit Creek and reselling smaller lots. He was involved in land transactions, one of which involved George Washington, for the area that would become New Hartford, New York. Between 1789 and 1820, he operated a paper mill, grist mill, and saw mill there. He also purchased land at Sangerfield, Skaneateles, Chittenango, and Weedsport; He established mills in some of these towns. To facilitate travel between the settlements, Sanger was an investor in the Seneca and Chenango Turnpikes (now New York State Route 12). Sanger gave his name to a town, Sangerfield, New York, a Masonic lodge, and other places in New York. He is noted as the first settler and founder of New Hartford through two historical markers. Among his various business pursuits, he was engaged in agriculture and manufacturing. He was a town supervisor, county judge, and state assemblyman and senator. He helped establish churches and a school. Early life Jedediah Sanger's childhood home, Richard Sanger III House, a historic house in Sherborn, Massachusetts that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Jedediah Sanger was born in Sherborn, Massachusetts on February 28, 1751. He was the ninth child of ten born to his parents, Deborah (n√©e Morse) Sanger and Richard Sanger III (1706-1786), who married . Like the colonial Sanger men before him, his father plied his trade as a blacksmith. Sanger III was also a successful businessman who inherited a sizable fortune from his father in 1731, which he enlarged through a lucrative trading business in Boston, real estate speculation in Maine, and the operation of a store and tavern in Sherborn. The family, one of the most prominent in Sherborn's history, lived in the Richard Sanger III House, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built by his father, Richard Sanger III, . Sanger was educated in the local schools and worked on a farm. He may have learned the saddler's trade and worked in that business in Sherborn. His first marriage was to Sarah Rider in 1771. Revolutionary War Battle of Lexington, Detroit Publishing Company, 1903‚Äì1904. During the war Sanger fought against the British at the Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 1775) Sanger served in the American Revolutionary War, from 1775 to 1781. In his first five days service, in April 1775, he rose from the rank of private in Captain Benjamin Bullard's Company of Minutemen to 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Massachusetts Regiment. During the war he fought against the British at the Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 1775), the Battle of Bunker Hill (June 1775), the Siege of Boston (1776), and the New York Campaign (1776). In 1779, he attained the rank of 1st Lieutenant and served in Rhode Island until March 18, 1781. New Hampshire Sanger moved to Jaffrey, New Hampshire, in Cheshire County, after his military service. He may have first worked there as a saddler. In 1777, he served on a committee of five to resist the annexation of a portion of Jaffrey by the neighboring Peterborough Slip. In 1782, he purchased a farm in Jaffrey near Gap Mountain. Alongside the farm, he operated a tavern and a small store on the property. From 1783 until 1786, he was selected to petition for a county road, was the town clerk, and was the moderator of one of the annual town meetings. In March 1785, he was appointed the Lt. Colonel of New Hampshire militia, 23rd regiment (later the 12th). A fire destroyed his property the night of February 27, 1784, leaving him bankrupt. The fire caused the first recorded accidental death in Jaffrey, killing Arthur Clark, who had come from Sherborn to work for his former neighbor. Sanger decided to leave the area and start over in the frontier of central New York . Settlement and land development in New York =New Hartford= Sanger arrived in the area, then known as Whitestown (the town of New Hartford was not split from Whitestown until 1827) in March 1788 at the age of 37, where he would purchase many hundreds of acres of land on both sides of Sauquoit Creek. He resold a large tract east of the creek, a year after purchasing it, to Joseph Higbee, the second settler in New Hartford. Sanger moved his family to the unincorporated village of Whitestown in March 1789 and built a saw mill there. The following year he added a grist mill. In 1805, he engaged in the manufacture of cotton goods. Sanger owned a paper mill on Sauquoit Creek, purchasing it around 1810-12 and selling it to Samuel Lyon before 1820. Sanger built a new house in 1810, which was three stories, the third used for at least seven years as meeting space for the Masonic lodge of Freemasons, which was named Amicable Lodge No. 23, where he presided as Master. Land deals There is legend that Sanger bought 1,000 acres, some of which became the town of New Hartford, and then sold half to Higbee for the same price. The earliest recorded account, published by Jones in the Annals and Recollections of Oneida County in 1851, states that Sanger bought of land for $500 (fifty cents/acre). Sanger sold the portion east of Sauquoit Creek, thought to be , to Joseph Higbee (or Higby), within a year, for $500 (one dollar/acre), a shrewd deal netting him the land where the majority of New Hartford's commercial development occurred for no cost. A subsequent survey showed the area Higbee purchased was actually . In 1889, it was reported, based upon analysis of property deed records, that Higbee purchased a 492-acre lot in December 1791 for about $1.06 per acre from Sanger, who reserved the rights to the water power of the creek. The 492-acre lot sold by Sanger to Higbee, a 183-acre lot on the west side of the creek that was sold by Sanger in July 1790, and a lot also on the west side of the creek that Sanger purchased from George Washington and George Clinton, add up to that makes up most of the original village of New Hartford. In 1810, Sanger was one of many claimants that sought relief from the legislature to settle a dispute over the title to arising after the land was omitted from a 1793 deed transferring the property to Philip Schuyler from the heirs of William Cosby. In 1811, they petitioned the legislature again to restrict the commissioners tasked with settling the dispute, between Cosby Patent and Coxe's or Freemason's Patent, to just define the boundary line. Sanger sold land in New Hartford to Richard Wills, an African American who established a farm and built a house there. The house was later owned by Wills's nephew, an active abolitionist, and was a stop on the Underground Railroad.  Agriculture Sanger continued farming various crops. At the Whitesboro Cattle Show and Fair held in October 1819, Sanger's winter wheat was judged third-best behind Benjamin Northrop of Deerfield (second place) and Reuben Gridley of Paris (first place). His oats earned first place, having yielded 84 bushels per acre, for which he was awarded a premium of $15 by the county agricultural society under a program implemented by the state Board of Agriculture \\"for the promotion of agriculture and domestic manufactures\\" under an 1819 state law. In the domestic animals category, he was awarded best boar. =Sangerfield= Historic marker of the Unadilla River. The lands west of the river ceded to New York State by the Oneida people of the Iroquois Nation in a treaty by Gov. George Clinton at Fort Schuyler, September 22, 1788. In 1788, the State of New York purchased land bordering the Unadilla River from the Oneida people. Two years later, Sanger and two others, Michael Myers and John J. Morgan, contracted to buy the portion of this land known as \\"township 20\\" from the state in 1790-91 as an investment for \\"three shillings and three pence per acre\\". Sanger began to sell or lease lots to settlers. He built the first sawmill there on Oriskany Creek in 1793 in what became the village of Waterville. In 1795, the town of Sangerfield was created by the state legislature and named to honor Sanger, who in turn agreed to donate \\"to the church of any religious denomination which should build the first house for public worship.\\" He also agreed to donate a \\"cask of rum\\" to the first town meeting. He provided the rum and donated to the Congregational Society as the first religious organization formed in town and 25 acres to the Baptists who built the first church. Many of the original settlers had disagreed with the town name, wanting it to be called \\"New Lisbon\\" instead; they later chose Lisbon for the name of the congregation. Sanger himself farmed land in Sangerfield, as did relative William Cary Sanger much later in the century. =Skaneateles= Agricultural land around Skaneateles Lake Sanger saw the potential of the area of Skaneateles Creek at the outlet of Skaneateles Lake and purchased large amounts of land there. He built a dam about 1796 or '97 and erected the first grist and sawmills there. He divided some of his land into lots which he then sold as the \\"village plots on the north end of Skaneateles Lake\\", presently in the village of Skaneateles. As a controlling investor in the Seneca Road Company, he had the Seneca turnpike built though Skaneateles, which included the first bridge over the creek, built in 1800. = Chittenango= In 1812, Sanger and Judge Youngs, also of New Hartford, purchased of land in Chittenango in Madison County from the bankrupt owner. They erected a grist-mill, saw-mill, and a cotton/clothing mill on Chittenango Creek. They sold the mills, the first commercial operation in this village, in 1816. = Weedsport = Sanger bought a tract of land in the Onondaga Military Tract from the private who received it from the government for his revolutionary war service and resold individual lots to settlers. This land currently includes the entire village of Weedsport in Cayuga County. Civic leadership =Local government= On April 7, 1789, the first town meeting of Whitestown was held in the barn of the area's namesake, Hugh White. Sanger was selected to be the town's first supervisor and a Commissioner of Highways. He was re-elected town supervisor in 1790 and 1791. Sanger was a justice in the first court held in Herkimer County in January 1794, having been named one of three \\"side judges\\" when the county was created in 1791. When Oneida County was split from Herkimer County in 1798, Sanger was named \\"First Judge\\" of the five county judges. The first Oneida County Court session was held in May 1798 at the schoolhouse near Fort Stanwix (present-day Rome), with Sanger presiding as First Judge. He was re-appointed several times through 1810, when he was no longer eligible due to his age of 60. The court was formally the Oneida County Court of Common Pleas and although judges were appointed by the Council of Appointment for five-year terms, Sanger was reappointed more often (in 1801, 1804, 1805, 1808, and 1810). =State offices= Engraving depicting Sanger in the New York State Assembly Sanger first ran for the Assembly in 1792, losing the election by four votes (502-498). He did receive 91% of the votes from Whitestown (of which New Hartford was then still a part), but his opponent, Michael Myers, had most of the other votes from the two other towns in the district (Herkimer and German Flatts). Concurrent with his duty as county judge, Sanger was also a member of the New York State Assembly from Herkimer County and Onondaga County in 1794-95 and served in ten more sessions of the Assembly or Senate. Sanger ran on the Federalist Party ticket. Sanger was interested in attracting doctors to establish practices in the newly settled areas of the state, and throughout his time in the legislature he introduced numerous bills \\"proposing state aid to physicians who might establish themselves in the 'West'\\".  Turnpikes  =Seneca Turnpike= In March 1794, the New York State Legislature passed a law calling for the laying out and improvement of a public road from old Fort Schuyler (Utica) on the Mohawk River to the settlement of Canawaugus on the Genesee River, in as straight a line as the topography of the land would allow. Called the \\"Great Genesee Road\\", it generally followed the old Iroquois trail to Oneida. By the end of the decade, many portions of the road were still substandard and some sections had still not been completed. The state outsourced the task of improving and maintaining the Genesee Road to the Seneca Road Company, chartered by a group of investors led by Sanger. The new Seneca Turnpike was authorized by the state on April 1, 1800, and legislated to run from the village of Utica west to the village of Cayuga in Cayuga County and on to Canandaigua in Ontario County. The road was, at the time, the longest turnpike in the state. The turnpike was to generally follow the path of the Genesee Road. Through his controlling interest in the company, Sanger had the road deviate from the Genesee Road after crossing the Mohawk River in Utica to turn southwest through New Hartford. This made the village prosper as it benefited from both the commerce brought by the road and the industry supported by the water power of the Saquoit. It was not until the completion of the Erie Canal which followed the Mohawk River valley through Utica that Utica overtook New Hartford as the commercial hub of the region. = Chenango Turnpike= In 1801, he was one of the founding members of the Chenango Turnpike Corporation. An act passed by the state legislature in March 1801 specified that the road should be built from the town of Oxford in Chenango County and follow as direct a route as possible to an intersection with the Seneca Turnpike (then called the Genesee Road) \\"at or near the house of Jedediah Sanger\\". This is the path of present New York State Route 12. Other businesses = Newspaper = Sanger, with Elijah Risley and Samuel Wells, founded the first newspaper printed in the state west of Albany, New York. The Whitestown Gazette was published in Whitestown (now New Hartford) beginning in 1793. After Sanger's involvement with the paper, it was moved to Utica, and after many mergers it became the Utica Observer-Dispatch. =Paris Furnace= Sanger was one of the principal proprietors of the Paris Furnace Company, the first manufacturing operation in the Sauquoit Valley. The forge and foundry, which went into operation in 1801, made iron products such as axes, hoes, scythes, plows, kettles commonly used at the time for making soap or potash, and hollow ware. Products were sold throughout New York and to neighboring states. He hired Gardner Avery to supervise the construction and operation of the furnace after witnessing Avery make a perilous crossing of the Hudson River, covered in thin ice, when a banker offered $100 to anyone that could deliver a package to the other side. The site of the company and surrounding settlement, up the Sauquoit from New Hartford, was known as Paris Furnace, and renamed Clayville in 1848 in honor of Henry Clay. Sanger had the company incorporated in 1823, and it operated until 1832 or 1833, several years after his death. =Federal Company= The Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation was a tract of land designated by the state legislature in 1797 around a natural salt spring for the commercialization of salt production in Salina on the shores of Onondaga Lake. Production began around 1789; salt was made by boiling the brine of the water. In 1798, Sanger, Asa Danforth, and about a half-dozen other investors formed the \\"Federal Company\\", which increased production by building the first permanent building at the site for salt manufacture, building a new and bigger well, and starting a large-scale operation of 32 kettles for producing salt. This company was the largest producer at the time. Sanger sold his interest in the company after two years. =Bank of Utica= He was named one of the directors of the Bank of Utica when it opened on December 8, 1812. Religious organizations St. Stephen's Church, New Hartford, New York. The church contains a marble plaque inscribed \\"He, being dead, yet speaketh\\" in Sanger's memory. Settlers began to come to the area that would become Whitestone in 1787, when it was wilderness. The town grew to about 3,000 by 1791. Desiring a church, on November 3, 1791, Sanger and others wrote to George Washington requesting a donation of 25 acres for a minister. The petition stated that the influence of a minister would \\"encourage sobriety, industry, morality, and religion among the people, and to render them good citizens.\\" Washington agreed. In 1791, a Congregational church was established in a meeting held in Sanger's barn, with Sanger named one of the \\"first class\\" trustees. In 1792, the congregation agreed to build a church on land donated by Sanger. Construction was completed in 1797, and the structure, since 1801 the New Hartford Presbyterian Church, is still a prominent building in the village. In the 1820s, Sanger made significant contributions for the construction of St. Stephen's Church in New Hartford. The church contains a marble plaque inscribed \\"He, being dead, yet speaketh\\" in Sanger's memory. In 1997, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. According to one source, he also donated the land for this church and left funding in his will. Other organizations Sanger was a founding member of the New Hartford masonic lodge (named Amicable Lodge) formed in 1792. He was elected an officer of the Grand (state) chapter at its organizational meeting held in January 1799 in Albany, where DeWitt Clinton presided as Grand High Priest. In 1793, Samuel Kirkland established Hamilton Oneida Academy in Clinton to educate and civilize the Iroquois (Five Nations) Indians in the region. Sanger made a large donation to the school and was named a trustee. When the school was chartered as Hamilton College in 1812, he was again named a trustee. Family =Immediate= Sanger was married to Sarah Rider from May 1771 to her death in September 1814 and to Sarah B. Kissam from August 1815 until her death due to apoplexy on April 22, 1825. He married his third wife, Fanny Dench of Washington, D.C., on October 3, 1827. She survived him and died in 1842. Sanger had four children with his first wife Sarah Rider. The first was Sarah, born in 1772, who died just after her fifth birthday. His second daughter, also named Sarah, was born in 1778. He also had two sons, Walter and Zedekiah, born in 1781 and 1783, respectively, who both died in 1802. Sarah, the only one of his children that survived him, married John Eames. As a wedding gift, Sanger built them a house in New Hartford, now known as the Eames mansion. Sarah and James had nine children, all of whom were born in Sanger's lifetime. Sarah died in 1861 at age 83 in New Hartford. =Notable relatives= Sanger's only younger sibling, Asa Sanger (born 1753), owned the Asa Sanger House that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places Sanger's younger brother, Asa Sanger (born 1753), came to own the Asa Sanger House which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A nephew, Colonel Calvin Sanger (1768‚Äì1835), the son of his brother Samuel, bought all the land in Sangerville, Maine which changed its name from Amestown to Sangerville when it was incorporated in 1814. Sanger's nephew Zedekiah, son of his brother Zedekiah, was an early settler in New Hartford, the father of Henry Sanger (born in New Hartford) whose son, William Cary Sanger, was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1895 to 1897 and the United States Assistant Secretary of War from 1901 to 1903. Death and legacy Sanger died on June 6, 1829, in his home in New Hartford at the age of 79. He was originally buried in the New Hartford village cemetery, then moved to a family burial plot on his farm, and finally was interred at the Forest Hill Cemetery in Utica in a family plot with his second and third wives and several of his children. The original gravestone, almost illegible, was supplemented with a new one in 2007. There are two New York Historic Markers that commemorate Sanger. One marks the founding of New Hartford (\\"Jedediah Sanger Founded New Hartford In 1788 By Purchasing 1000 Acres Of Land And Settling Here With His Family\\") and one the 1790 grist mill (\\"A Grist Mill Was Built 350 Feet East Of Here In 1790 By Jedediah Sanger, First Settler And Founder Of New Hartford\\"). Sangertown Square, a regional shopping mall in New Hartford, is named after him, as is the New Hartford High School yearbook, the \\"Jedediac\\". There is a street named Sanger Avenue in the village of New Hartford. A Masonic lodge was formed in Waterville and named the Sanger Lodge No. 129. Sanger's family bible is in the possession of the Oneida County Historical Society and is still used for ceremonial purposes, such as when the new town supervisor took the oath of office in 2010.

During the Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì1939, she was one of the ships that helped to enforce the non-intervention agreement. When France declared war on Germany in September 1939, all of the Vauquelins were assigned to the High Sea Forces ( (FHM)) which was tasked to escort French convoys and support the other commands as needed. Vauquelin escorted a pair of heavy cruisers to French West Africa, but otherwise remained in the Mediterranean for the duration of the war. The Vichy French reformed the FHM after the French surrender in June. She ferried ammunition to French Lebanon after it was invaded by the Allied forces in June 1941 and then unsuccessfully attempted to transport reinforcements there the following month.

Vauquelin, Tartu and Le Chevalier Paul were assigned to the FHM on 15 November. After the Allies invaded Lebanon and Syria on 8 June 1941, Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan, Minister of War and National Defense in the Vichy government, ordered Le Chevalier Paul to carry ammunition for the French ships in Beirut, French Lebanon, departing on 11 June. He had requested permission to do so via radio message which the British decoded and alerted them to the ship's mission and route. Le Chevalier Paul was sunk during the early morning of 16 June by torpedo bombers based in Cyprus and Vauquelin was dispatched the following day, carrying 800 rounds of 138.6 mm ammunition.

When France declared war on 3 September, the reorganization was ordered and the 3rd Light Squadron, which included the 5th and 9th Scout Divisions with all of the Vauquelin-class ships, was assigned to the 3rd Squadron which was transferred to Oran, French Algeria, on 3 September. The 9th Scout Division with Cassard, Kersaint and Maill√© Br√©z√© was assigned to escort duties until April 1940, although the former ship was detached (12 November‚Äì21 January 1940) to Force X in the Atlantic which was tasked to search for German commerce raiders and blockade runners. Afterwards Cassard rejoined her scout division which had returned to Toulon during her deployment. She was transferred to the 5th Scout Division in early June. Anticipating a declaration of war by the Italians, the Mediterranean Fleet planned to bombard installations on the Italian coast. After they declared war on 10 June, Cassard and the rest of the 5th Scout Division were among the ships ordered to attack targets in Vado Ligure on 14 June. The destroyer was tasked to bombard factories in the town. Two Italian MAS boats on patrol attempted to attack the French ships, but only one was able to launch a torpedo before they were driven off with light damage by the French defensive fire. Damage assessments afterward revealed that little damage had been inflicted despite expending over 1,600 rounds of all calibers.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 125, 222‚Äì223, 229‚Äì231; Rohwer, p. 28 A view of Toulon harbor, late 1944, looking down the length of the Quai No√´l.

After the French surrender on 22 June, the Royal Navy attacked the ships in Mers-el-K√©bir, French Algeria, on 3 July to prevent them from being turned over to the Germans. To avoid an attack on the ships based nearby in Oran, they steamed for Toulon and Cassard was one of the ships that rendezvoused with them en route and escorted them to Toulon. The Vichy French reformed the FHM on 25 September after it negotiated rules limiting the force's activities and numbers with the Italian and German Armistice Commissions. Cassard was the only ship of her class assigned to it and was one of its escorts when they made a training sortie into the Western Mediterranean on 16‚Äì18 October. After the Allies invaded French Lebanon and Syria in June 1941, Cassard, Tartu and the heavy cruiser transported a battalion of infantry from Algiers, French Algeria, to Marseilles that was intended to reinforce the Levant between 30 June and 1 July. When the Germans attempted to capture the French ships in Toulon on 27 November 1942, the ship was scuttled by her crew. The Germans made an effort to salvage her in late 1943, but gave up the attempt.

Dossier des mausol√©es royaux de Numidie, de la Maur√©tanie et des monuments fun√©raires pr√©-islamiques (Unesco)  History  James Bruce's sketch Libyco-Punic mausoleum before its renovation The first westerners to visit the site of Dougga arrived in the 17th century, becoming more frequent throughout the nineteenth century. Historique de l'exploration du site de Dougga (Strabon) The mausoleum was described by several of these tourists and was the object of early architectural studies at the end of the period. In 1842, the British consul in Tunis Thomas Reade seriously damaged the monument in the process of removing the royal inscription which decorated it. The current state of monument is the result of a reconstruction of the pieces strewn through the surrounding area, carried out with Tunisian support by the French archaeologist between 1908 and 1910.Louis Poinssot, ¬´ La restauration du mausol√©e de Dougga ¬ª, CRAI, vol. 54, n¬∞9, 1910, p. 781  Description  Detail of the sculptures on the upper level The 21 m high mausoleum is divided into three levels, atop a five step pedestal. On the north face of the podium, the first of the three levels, an opening covered by a slab leads to the funerary chamber. The mausoleum's other faces are decorated with false openings, the corners with Aeolic pilasters. The sepulchre's second level consists of a colonnade in the form of a shrine (naiskos). The engaged columns on each side are of the ionic order. The third and final level is the most richly decorated: in addition to pilasters on the corners similar to those on the first level, it is capped by a pyramid. Sculptural elements have survived: griffons are perched on the corners and a quadriga on one of the faces of the upper level.  Bilingual Punic and Libyan inscription The bilingual Punic- Libyan Inscription of Dougga The bilingual Numidian and Punic-Libyan Inscription now in the British Museum enabled the decipherment of the Numidian alphabet: Mausol√©e libyco-punique de Dougga (Institut national du patrimoine)  Interpretation  Detail of the upper frieze The Libyo-Punic Mausoleum has often been connected with the funerary monuments of Asia Minor and necropolises of Alexandria of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.Pierre Gros, L'architecture romaine du d√©but du IIIe si√®cle av. J.-C. √† la fin du Haut- Empire, tome 2 ¬´ Maisons, palais, villas et tombeaux ¬ª, √©d. Picard, Paris, 2001, p. 417 On account of the inscription, the tomb is considered to be dedicated to Atban son of Iepmatah son of Palu. It has recently been determined that the inscription, which is located beside one of the false doors of the podium,Mustapha Khanoussi, Dougga, √©d. Agence de mise en valeur du patrimoine et de promotion culturelle, Tunis, 2008, p. 74 was not unique. Another inscription, irreparably damaged, would have enumerated the titulare of the tomb's occupant. According to recent studies, the names mentioned on the surviving inscription are merely the monument's builders: the architect and the various head artisans. The monument would have been built by the citizens of the city for a Numidian prince. It is thought to have possibly been a tomb or cenotaph intended for Massinissa.Mustapha Khanoussi, op. cit., p. 75  See also  * Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania * Madghacen * El Khroub * Numidia * Ancient Carthage  References   Bibliography  * Gabriel Camps, ¬´ Dougga ¬ª, Encyclop√©die berb√®re, tome XVI, √©d.

The ship entered service in 1934 and spent most of her career in the Mediterranean. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì1939, she was one of the ships that helped to enforce the non-intervention agreement. When France declared war on Germany in September 1939, all of the Vauquelins were assigned to the High Sea Forces ( (FHM)) which was tasked to escort French convoys and support the other commands as needed. Le Chevalier Paul was briefly deployed to Scotland in early 1940 to support the Allied forces in the Norwegian Campaign, but returned to the Mediterranean in time to participate in Operation Vado, a bombardment of Italian coastal facilities after Italy entered the war in June. The ship was assigned to the Vichy French FHM when it was reformed after the French surrender later in June. She attempted to ferry ammunition to French Lebanon after it was invaded by the Allied forces in June 1941, but was sunk off the coast of French Syria by British aircraft with almost all of her crew surviving. Design and description Right elevation and plan of the Vauquelin class The Vauquelin- class ships were designed as improved versions of the preceding s. They had an overall length of , a beam of ,Jordan & Moulin, p. 112 and a draft of . The ships displaced at standardChesneau, p. 268 and at deep load. They were powered by two geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four du Temple boilers. The turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ships at . During her sea trials on 3 March 1934, Le Chevalier Pauls Parsons turbines provided and she reached for a single hour. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew consisted of 10 officers and 201 crewmen in peacetime and 12 officers and 220 enlisted men in wartime.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 112, 116 The main armament of the Vauquelin-class ships consisted of five Mod√®le 1927 guns in single shielded mounts, one superfiring pair fore and aft of the superstructure and the fifth gun abaft the aft funnel. Their anti-aircraft armament consisted of four Mod√®le 1927 guns in single mounts positioned amidships and two twin mounts for Hotchkiss Mod√®le 1929 anti-aircraft machineguns on the forecastle deck abreast the bridge. The ships carried two above-water twin mounts for torpedo tubes, one pair on each broadside between the pairs of funnels as well as one triple mount aft of the rear pair of funnels. A pair of depth charge chutes were built into their stern; these housed a total of sixteen depth charges, with eight more in reserve. They were also fitted with a pair of depth-charge throwers, one on each broadside abreast the aft funnels, for which they carried a dozen depth charges. The ships could be fitted with rails to drop 40 Breguet B4 mines.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 112, 120 =Modifications= The depth-charge throwers were removed in 1936 and more 200-kilogram depth charges were carried in their place. The Navy reconsidered its anti-submarine warfare tactics after the war began in September and intended to reinstate the depth-charge throwers, although these were an older model than the one previously installed; Le Chevalier Paul had not received hers before her loss. As an interim measure, a pair of rails were installed on the stern for depth charges. Each rail could accommodate three depth charges and ten more were stored in the magazine. During the ship's late 1940‚Äìearly 1941 anti-aircraft refit, the mainmast was replaced by a platform for a single 37-millimeter twin-gun mount and two of her single 37-millimeter mounts were transferred to the platform while the other two single mounts were removed. The Hotchkiss machineguns were repositioned in front of the bridge and a pair of Browning 13.2-millimeter AA machine guns were installed on new platforms between the funnels. Her aft torpedo mount was removed to compensate for the additional weight. Le Chevalier Paul was scheduled to receive a British Alpha 128 ASDIC system, but was sunk before it could be installed.Jordan & Moulin 2015, pp. 123‚Äì128Whitley, p. 41 Construction and career Le Chevalier Paul, named after Chevalier Paul, was ordered on 1 February 1930 from Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e as part of the 1929 Naval Program. She was laid down at their La Seyne-sur-Mer shipyard on 28 February 1931, launched on 21 March 1932, commissioned on 1 June 1934 and entered service on 24 August 1934. Her entry into service was delayed when one of her gearboxes was transferred to the destroyer .Jordan & Moulin, pp. 109‚Äì110 When the Vauquelins entered service they were assigned to the 5th and the newly formed 6th Light Divisions ( (DL)) which were later redesignated as scout divisions (). Le Chevalier Paul and her sister ships and were assigned to the 5th DL of the group of large destroyers ( (GCT) of the 3rd Squadron (), based in Toulon. On 27 June 1935, all of the Vauquelins, except Cassard, participated in a naval review conducted by the Navy Minister () Fran√ßois Pi√©tri in the Baie de Douarnenez after combined maneuvers by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 206‚Äì208, 213‚Äì215 After the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, the and destroyers in the Mediterranean were assigned to assist French citizens in Spain and to patrol the surveillance zones assigned to France on a monthly rotation beginning on 24 September as part of the non-intervention agreement. The GCT reverted to its previous designation of the 3rd Light Squadron on 15 September. As of 1 October 1936 Le Chevalier Paul, Tartu and were assigned to the 5th Light Division while , and Cassard belonged to the 9th, both of which were assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. In May‚ÄìJune 1938 the Mediterranean Squadron cruised the Eastern Mediterranean; the squadron was redesignated at the Mediterranean Fleet () on 1 July 1939.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 206‚Äì208, 213‚Äì214 On 27 August 1939, in anticipation of war with Nazi Germany, the French Navy planned to reorganize the Mediterranean Fleet into the FHM of three squadrons. When France declared war on 3 September, the reorganization was ordered and the 3rd Light Squadron, which included the 5th and 9th Scout Divisions with all of the Vauquelin-class ships, was assigned to the 3rd Squadron which was transferred to Oran, French Algeria, on 3 September. On 5 April 1940, the 5th Scout Division with Le Chevalier Paul, Tartu and Maill√© Br√©z√© was assigned to Force Z in anticipation of an Allied invasion of Norway; their mission was to escort convoys between Scotland and Norway. The German invasion on 9 April preempted the Allies and Le Chevalier Paul did not begin her escort duties until mid-April when she covered Convoy FP-1 transporting the 5th Demi-Brigade of Mountain Infantry () to participate in the Namsos Campaign on 19 April. On 24‚Äì27 April, the ship escorted Convoy FP-2 conveying the 27th Demi-Brigade of Mountain Infantry to Harstad, Norway, to join the Battle of Narvik. On 3‚Äì4 May she joined Tartu, the destroyer and the British destroyers and in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept a German convoy. The 5th Scout Division returned to Toulon on 27 May in anticipation of the Italians joining the war as the Mediterranean Fleet was prepared to attack them. After they declared war on 10 June, the fleet planned to bombard installations on the Italian coast. Le Chevalier Paul and the rest of the 5th Scout Division were among the ships ordered to attack targets in Vado Ligure on 14 June. The destroyer was tasked to bombard the Petrolea oil tanks. Two Italian MAS boats on patrol attempted to attack the French ships, but only one was able to launch a torpedo before they were driven off with light damage by the French defensive fire. Damage assessments afterward revealed that little damage had been inflicted despite expending over 1,600 rounds of all calibers.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 222, 226‚Äì227, 229‚Äì230; Rohwer, pp. 21‚Äì22, 28 The Vichy French government reestablished the FHM on 25 September after it negotiated rules limiting the force's activities and numbers with the Italian and German Armistice Commissions. Le Chevalier Paul, Tartu and Vauquelin were assigned to the FHM on 15 November. After the Allies invaded Lebanon and Syria on 8 June 1941, Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan, Minister of War and National Defense in the Vichy government, ordered Le Chevalier Paul to carry ammunition for the French ships in Beirut, French Lebanon, departing on 11 June. He had requested permission from the Germans and Italians to do so via radio message which the British decoded and alerted them to the ship's mission and route. She passed the Greek island of Kastellorizo on 15 June and hugged the coast of Turkey to try to avoid detection or interception by British forces on Cyprus, but a British reconnaissance aircraft found her at 18:15 on 15 June. Six Fleet Air Arm Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 815 Naval Air Squadron attacked her off the Syrian coast at 03:00 the next morning and torpedoed her at the cost of one Swordfish shot down.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 218, 237, 239 Chevalier Paul radioed for help, and the Vichy French destroyers and departed Beirut an hour later to come to her aid, but were almost immediately intercepted by the New Zealand light cruiser and the destroyers and and forced to retire to Beirut. After French aircraft drove off the Allied ships, Valmy and Gu√©pard again set out to assist Chevalier Paul, but they were too late, the ship sank at 06:45 off the coast of Syria. Valmy and Gu√©pard rescued her all of her crew, except seven missing men, and the crew of the downed Swordfish.O‚Ä≤Hara, pp. 131‚Äì132 Notes References  Category:Vauquelin-class destroyers Category:1932 ships Category:Ships built in France Category:Maritime incidents in June 1941 Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Ships sunk by British aircraft Category:Destroyers sunk by aircraft ","title":"French destroyer Le Chevalier Paul (1932)"},{"id":"47684431","text":"Mushtaq Omar Uddin (born 14 August 1973), also known simply as Mushtaq, is an English music producer, singer, songwriter, and former lead vocalist for British hip hop group Fun-Da-Mental when he was known at the time by his stage name MC Mushtaq.

The park is situated in the neighborhood Midtbyen by the coast with the Bay of Aarhus to the southeast, the Marselisborg neighborhood to the West and the Port of Aarhus to the North. The park is bounded by Strandvejen and Marselis Havnevej across from Chr. Filtenborgs Square. It is a municipal park managed by the Nature and Environment department (Danish: Natur og Milj√∏) of Aarhus Municipality. Tangkrogen got its name from the kelp that filled the cove when recreational jetties were constructed when the city of Aarhus initially developed the area into a public park in the early 20th century. Overview The park is 9.884 acres of open grassy fields, clay covered event spaces and a part of the coastline, used as a berthing area for small recreational boats such as kayaks and dinghys. The park is the main event venue in Aarhus and it is divided between different areas designed for different purposes. The central area is dubbed Cirkus Pladsen (Circus Square), is a 2700 acres clay covered venue frequently used by travelling circuses, markets and other events that require fixed structures or heavy machinery. Adjacent to it is 3400 acres of grassy fields designed for durability and smaller structures such as tents. The park is bounded by 3707 acres of grassy recreational areas with trees and bushes mainly intended for daily low intensity use. The park includes water fountains in different areas, sewers and public toilets and is rated to host up to 20.000 visitors. There are 500 adjacent parking spaces and it lies close to public transport from Strandvejen, Chr. Filtenborgs Plads and Hans Broges Gade.

He was a founder of the Charles H. Tweed Foundation for Orthodontic Research. Tweed a student of Edward Angle in Pasadena, California and a classmate of Raymond Begg. Education He was born in New York (Manhattan), New York in 1895. He attended Phoenix public schools until he attended Stanford University as a pre-dental student and received his D.D.S degree from University of California in 1919. After graduation, he returned to Phoenix to practice General Dentistry for next 8 years. In the year 1927, Tweed decided to join Angle School of Orthodontia after giving up his private practice. There under Edward Angle, Charles spent few years gaining knowledge of the field. He was chosen by Edward Angle to assist in preparing the edgewise bracket for introduction and manufacture. He then returned to Phoenix to work as a Private Practice Orthodontist and eventually ended up moving to Tucson, Arizona. Edward Angle, who had pancreatic cancer had died between Tweed leaving Phoenix and arriving in Pasadena. He was instructed at the Angle School by three orthodontists who had worked at the School with Angle: George Hahn, Si Kloehn and John? Terwilleger. Tweed was not a classmate of P. Raymond Begg as Begg had attended the Angle School in 1924, as confirmed in the Wikipedia entry for Begg and in the Australian Begg Society of Orthodontists web site. Begg and Tweed never met.  Career  It is important to note that Tweed's philosophy was different than Edward Angle, his mentor. Edward Angle practiced strictly without extraction of teeth to achieve harmonious occlusion. Tweed believed that extracting teeth lead to a more harmonious profile than what Angle achieved in his practice and was the best technique to prevent orthodontic relapse. In 1940, Tweed took 100 patients and treated them without extractions. When their treatment had failed, he then treated them with extractions for no additional fee. He presented his findings in 1940 at the AAO annual meeting. According to Proffit et al., under the leadership of Charles Tweed, extraction of teeth was reintroduced into orthodontics in the 1940s and 1950s to enhance facial esthetics and occlusal relationships. However, Tweed's \\"serial extraction\\" technique met with opposition from some colleagues, such as the world-renowned Dr. B. F. Dewel, later president of the American Association of Orthodontics, who termed the procedure a \\"mutilation\\" of the facial structure and critiqued Tweed's idiosyncratic ideal of beauty: a recessed face was hardly more attractive than a \\"full smile\\", he claimed. Dewel, BF. Serial Extraction: Its Limitations and Contradictions in Orthodontic Treatment,\\" AJO, Vol 23, Number 12, December 1967, pp. 905-921. Dewel launches his article with a warning: \\"Not too much is known about growth, but certainly the presence of teeth contributes to growth and the absence of teeth detracts from growth. The early removal of premolars is then likely to cause a concave, recessive area in the lower half of the face‚Ä¶\\" (905) The \\"extraction versus non-extraction debate\\" became and remains the most controversial issue in the orthodontic industry, and grew especially heated after the Brimm lawsuit of 1986, in which a young Michigan woman won 1.3 million dollars from her orthodontist due to what the jury termed \\"mutilation\\" of her facial structure. The members of the American Association of Orthodontics, after this lawsuit, bonded to defend Tweed's technique, and today it continues, despite frequent challenges and extraction victim reports, to be an industry standard, with Tweed hailed as \\"a pioneer.\\" Tweed published his first article in the Angle Orthodontist journal, titled \\"Reports of Cases Treated with the Edgewise Arch Mechanism\\". He published the textbook Clinical orthodontics in 1966 which summed up over 40 years of his research and work in the field of orthodontics. Tweed during his discussions on a particular Orthodontic subject was famous for this saying \\"Just put your plaster on the table\\" which meant Let the Treatment Speak For Itself.  Orthodontics  = Early years = During his early years, Tweed found that large number of his cases experienced failures either due to relapse of the corrected dentition or poor facial esthetics. Tweed's failures occurred due to expansion of the arches. Tweed believed in keeping the mandibular incisors uprighted over the basal bone and thus he would expand the arches buccal. However, due to failures Tweed resorted to extracting teeth while keeping the mandibular plane to lower incisor angle at 90 degree +/- 10 degrees. The tides turned once more, however, in the 1990s, notably after the 1986 Brimm lawsuit, in which Tweed's approach was proven to lead to serious jaw disorder and the rate of extractions halved in the United States. Today in the US it is more common to try to expand the arches first, using palate expanders, rather than resort to extractions. The rate of the practice of extractions is still high in other countries, particularly in Asia where up to 80% of cases are still done with extractions. Today there are over a dozen forums devoted to extraction victims, with new members worldwide (particularly from Asian countries) writing in each day, seeking help for the health and aesthetic consequences of the extraction-retraction procedure. In response to the growing need, a new specialty in orthodontics has developed to reverse Tweed's procedure and use implants to replace the extracted teeth, a process that takes about 3 years and costs between 20,000 and 40,000 US dollars, hence critiqued for not being readily accessible to all who need it. Maxillary-facial surgeons also routinely operate on extraction victims, to advance the jaws back to a normal position. = Tweed Occlusion = Tweed occlusion refers to an end result of an orthodontic treatment that Tweed and his followers tried to achieve when finishing treatment. He believed in maximum facial harmony and balance, defined as the lower midface being more retruded than the upper, and therefore he believed in treating the mandibular incisors over the basal bone of the mandible. Components of tweed occlusion are: # Flat mandibular arch # Maintaining the Curve of Spee in Maxillary Arch # Second molars in both arches tipped distally and out of occlusion with each other # First molars tipped distally so Mesiobuccal Cusp of Upper 1st molar lying on the buccal groove of the lower 1st molar # Anterior teeth close to an end-to-end relationship. He believed in maximum facial harmony and balance and therefore he believed in treating the mandibular incisors over the basal bone of the mandible. Tweed is known for creating the Tweed Analysis. A number of the above occlusion principles have been put in question in the last decades, particularly in France.  Charles H. Tweed International Foundation  The formation of the club originated in 1941. Tweed had a study club which included few orthodontists such as Sam Lewis, Copeland Shelden, Robert H. W. Strang, Cecil C. Steiner, William B. Downs, Herbert I. Margolis, Paul Lewis and Hayes Nance. The group initially met in 1941 and 1942, and due to World War II resumed their meetings in 1946. During the 1946 meeting, Tweed's study group decided to established the Charles H. Tweed Foundation for Orthodontic Research. The Tweed Study Course is a 10-day course offered by the Charles H. Tweed International Foundation which offers hand-on experience to students and orthodontists alike. During 1950s, admission into the course required applicants to submit a typodont setup and a treated case. Up until 2019, the American Board of Orthodontics required an orthodontic student to present an extraction case to be qualified as an orthodontist.

It is sometimes a prostrate, others an erect shrub. Its branches and leaves are warty and it has white or pink flowers, often spotted, followed by succulent white fruits. It generally grows in arid areas in South Australia but has also been found in Victoria and Western Australia. Description Myoporum brevipes is a shrub, sometimes prostrate, others erect and spreading. It grows to a height of high and has wart-like tubercles covering its branches and leaves. The leaves are arranged alternately and are thick, often fleshy, long, wide. They are variable in shape but often egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. The flowers are arranged in groups of 1 to 5 in the axils of the leaves and have 5 sepals and 5 white or pink petals joined at their base to form a tube and often spotted with pink or purple. The tube is long and the lobes are long and warty. There are 4 stamens which extend beyond the petals. Flowering occurs between October and February and is followed by white fruits which are drupes, in diameter and oval or roughly spherical in shape. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum brevipes was first formally described in 1870 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis from a specimen collected on an expedition of John McDouall Stuart. The specific epithet (brevipes) is derived from the Latin words brevis meaning \\"short\\" and pes meaning \\"foot\\",\\"probably referring to the short pedicels (flower stalks) in the material available to Bentham.\\" Distribution and habitat Myoporum brevipes occurs mainly in South Australia, although there are small populations in Western Australia. It is very rare in Victoria with only a few individual plants near Boinka. It grows in sandy soils containing calcium carbonate on sand dunes or near saline lakes and often in disturbed situations such as roadsides.

This includes Arabs, Kurds, Turks, Assyrians as well as smaller minorities from Syria. The number of Syrians in Germany is estimated at around 600,000 people in December 2016 and consists mainly of refugees of the Syrian Civil War. Some other sources claim 200,000 estimated Syrian citizens to reside within Germany as of September 2015. Among German districts, Bonn and Wiesbaden had the highest shares of Syrian migrants in 2011, according to German Census data. Migration history During the European migrant crisis of 2014-2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees of the Syrian Civil War entered Germany to seek refugee status. The European migrant crisis was eased somewhat on 4 September 2015, Chancellor Werner Faymann of Austria, in conjunction with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, announced that migrants would be allowed to cross the border from Hungary into Austria and onward to Germany, and early on 5 September 2015, buses with migrants began crossing the Austro-Hungarian border. As of 31 December 2014, the Federal Statistical Office of Germany estimated that there were 118,196 people with Syrian citizenship in Germany. According to the German Interior Ministry, between January 2015 and October 2015, there were 243,721 Syrian citizens who entered Germany to seek asylum. Therefore, there were more than 360,000 Syrian citizens residing in Germany as of October 2015. As of 31 December 2016, the total number of Syrians in Germany reached 637,845. Since Germany's peak number asylum applicants in 2015 ‚Äì 890,000 ‚Äì the trend began to reverse. In 2018, only 185,000 Syrians applied for asylum in Germany. Despite the heavy drop in applications, deportations nearly doubled to 20,000 a year, marking a shifting sentiment among the German people away from the welcoming culture that brought thousands of Syrians to Germany since 2015. The changing sentiments among German leaders and citizens towards Syrian refugees comes in light of an increasingly right-wing Parliament. In the 2017 elections, the Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) Party gained seats, bringing far right opposition to immigration to the national stage. Of the over 740,000 Syrians living in Germany, just under 1,000 of them voluntarily agreed to return to Syria in 2018. Due to this extremely low rate of return to Syria, there is growing concern amongst Syrian refugees that once the volunteers and criminals are deported from the country, the idea of deportations will be normalized. Some Syrians believe this normalization will lead to a larger wave of deportations that will remove people who can't speak German or don't contribute to the economy. A large part of the resistance to return to Syria ‚Äì despite the subsiding of the war ‚Äì is Bashar Al-Assad's continued rule of most of the country.

Detective is a 1938 American comedy film directed by William Clemens and written by Kenneth Gamet. The film stars Bonita Granville, John Litel, James Stephenson, Frankie Thomas, Frank Orth and Helena Phillips Evans. The film was released by Warner Bros. on November 19, 1938. Plot Wealthy Mary Eldredge (Helena Phillips Evans) decides to donate $250,000 (in 2020 purchase-power that would be $4.5 million) to her alma mater, where teenager Nancy Drew (Bonita Granville) is a student. When Mary doesn't deliver the check to the lawyer Carson Drew (John Litel), Nancy's father, and disappears, it seems as if she has backed out of her original intention. And Nancy‚Äôs classmates turn on her, annoyed that she had gotten their hopes up about getting a swimming pool for the school. Nancy sets out to find out what really happened. Along the way, with the help of her neighbor and best friend Ted Nickerson (Frankie Thomas), she deals with the kidnapping of her family's doctor, a slow policeman, and an injured carrier pigeon. At one point, Nancy and Ted hire a plane to look from the air for a house that fits some clues that they have collected. Planning to rescue Mary, they gain entry to the suspected location, Ted disguised as a nurse and Nancy as a widow. They find Mary but, during their attempted escape, all three are captured. Locked in a basement, Ted finds an old x-ray machine and uses it to produce radio and telephone interference, encoding it to send a call for help. Nancy‚Äôs father and the police get the message and the gang that had kidnapped Mary is caught. Several times Nancy uses the phrase \\"I bet you 23/80.\\" And Ted also mentions 23/80. They are both making reference to the WPA weekly wage during the Great Depression: $23.80.

La tempesta di mare may also refer to two earlier versions of the same concerto, RV 98, a concerto da camera (chamber concerto) featuring the flute, from which Vivaldi derived the concerto grosso RV 570. La tempesta di mare may also refer to the violin concerto with the same name published in the same 1725 edition as the Four Seasons: this is however a different composition than the three flute concerto variants.  History  Vivaldi helped to bring the concerto to a mainstream form, not only by expanding on ritornello form, but by emphasizing the slow movements of concertos, which were in a two part binary form. Solo instruments that Vivaldi wrote concertos for include violin, bassoon, cello, oboe, viola d'amore, flute and mandolin.Sadie, Stanley \\"Vivaldi, Antonio\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. London: 1980, pp. 31-45 He also wrote ensemble concertos (concerto grosso and/or chamber concerto), where three or more soloists participate, which number over 30 written. Vivaldi had an extensive influence on the concerto genre, helping to pioneer the structure, expanding the boundaries of the genre, and showing that any instrument could have a concerto. Vivaldi's contemporaries and predecessors such as Purcell, Bach and Handel featured the flute (traverso and/or recorder) significantly in their works.Sadie, Stanley, \\"Recorder\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments. London: 1984. pp. 205-215 RV 433 was conceived as a concerto for transverse flute in D. The first publication of the concerto, included as No. 1 in Vivaldi's Op. 10, VI Concerti a Flauto Traverso, was around 1728 in Amsterdam, by Michel-Charles Le C√®ne. The La tempesta di mare name for the concerto is given in the score.. Giving a musical impression of a storm was a popular theme in baroque music. For instance operas like Marin Marais' Alcyone contained famous storm scenes. Telemann wrote a secular cantata La Tempesta (The Storm), TWV 20:42, after an Italian libretto by Metastasio. Vivaldi wrote several tempesta di mare concertos.Talbot, Michael. \\"Dictionary\\" p. 183 in The Vivaldi Compendium. Boydell Press, 2011. Two variants of RV 433, RV 98 and RV 570, are in the chamber concerto and concerto grosso format respectively.. RV 98 is scored for flute, oboe, violin, bassoon, and continuo, from which Vivaldi created the RV 570 concerto grosso by adding orchestral violins to reinforce the solo oboe and violin, and a viola part doubling the bass at the upper octave. An unrelated tempesta di mare concerto, a violin concerto in E major, RV 253, is included as No. 5 in Vivaldi's Op. 8 Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione.. The Four Seasons, the first four concertos of that collection, also include a few musical depictions of stormy weather. According to Federico Maria Sardelli the chamber concerto version of La tempesta di mare, RV 98, was possibly written for Ignazio Sieber, during the time in which he worked with the composer at the Ospedale della Piet√† from 1713 to 1716. This means that this version of the concerto may have been the earliest flute concerto ever composed, and also the first flute piece to include the problematic high F6. Sardelli's conclusions, if correct, would overturn \\"the received scholarly view that, rather than writing for the recorder in the first two or three decades of the eighteenth century, then switching over to the flute, Vivaldi already preferred the flute in the 1710s and did not start writing for the recorder until the early 1720s\\".  Structure  The movements of the concerto are: # Allegro # Largo # Presto  Reception  RV 433 is not among the five concertos Vivaldi composed for the recorder (RV 441‚Äì445). Being one of the 14 concertos Vivaldi wrote for traverso (including one for two traversos), the concerto is nonetheless often performed as a recorder concerto, like many of these other traverso concertos. Thus it is for instance included in Dan Laurin's Recorder Concertos CD.Dan Laurin and Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble. Antonio Vivaldi: Recorder Concertos. Bis, 1994 There are dozens of recordings of the concerto, performed on the traverso as well as the recorder, for instance by Jean-Pierre Rampal in the 1960s,Jean-Pierre Rampal with I Solisti Veneti conducted by Claudio Scimone. \\"No. 1 in F major, P. 261: La tempesta di mare\\" in Antonio Vivaldi: The complete flute concertos.

Career Pearce was born in 1967, and first attracted public attention at the age of sixteen when he appeared on Junior Pot Black in 1983, defeated by fourteen-year-old Stephen Hendry 70‚Äì23 in the quarter-finals. Cymvolon. \\"Stephen Hendry vs Nick Pearce (Junior PB 1983)\\" , Cymvolon. Retrieved on 19 February 2016. Pearce turned professional in 1992, and won nine of his first eleven matches; however, the open nature of the tour at that time was such that these were played in his first two tournaments, and he reached only the last 96 at the 1992 Grand Prix. There, he faced veteran Welshman Cliff Wilson and made his first competitive century break, an effort of 100, but was defeated 4‚Äì5. The following several years were barren, but in the 1995/1996 season, Pearce reached the last 48 at the 1995 Thailand Open, and the semi-final - a career-best - at the 1996 International Open. In the former, he defeated five opponents including Robin Hull, Tony Jones and the young Stephen Lee, before losing 3‚Äì5 to Joe Swail; in the latter, he beat Steven de Baets, Sean Storey, Robby Foldvari, Les Dodd, Mick Price, Jason Prince, David Roe and Dave Harold, setting up an encounter with Rod Lawler. Pearce led 4‚Äì2 and 5‚Äì3 in their match, but could not prevent a fightback from Lawler and a 5‚Äì6 loss to the eventual runner-up. Having begun the season as the world number 204, Pearce's run to the semi-finals earned him ¬£16,000; the other eight tournaments he had entered had heralded no prize money at all, but by its conclusion he had jumped 109 places to 95th. The next season was more successful, as Pearce registered several last-64 finishes, reaching the last 32 at the 1997 British Open and the last 16 at the 1996 Grand Prix. At the Grand Prix, he notably beat Ronnie O'Sullivan 5‚Äì1 in their last-32 match, but lost his next 0‚Äì5 to the Canadian Alain Robidoux; in the British Open, he defeated Simon Morris, Jeff Cundy, Euan Henderson and Chris Small but was again whitewashed, this time losing 0‚Äì5 to Mark Williams. He finished the season at a career-high ranking of 57th. Pearce's form dipped sharply thereafter, and he did not progress beyond the last 48 at a ranking event again. Having finished the 2002/2003 season ranked 113th, he was relegated from the tour, losing his professional status at the age of 36. Pearce attempted to re-qualify during the following season, but entered only the first Challenge Tour event, losing 0‚Äì4 to Matthew Selt in the first round. He entered qualifying for the 2013 World Seniors Championship, but lost his first round match 1‚Äì2 to Darren Thompson.

Habitat  This snail has only been found in one location, a stream in the Ida Cave in the Oparara River Valley in the Kahurangi National Park. This area is a protected forest reserve managed by the Department of Conservation. Although the population trend of this species is regarded as being stable the main threats to this snail are pollution events in the stream it inhabits and caving activities.  Conservation status  In November 2018 the Department of Conservation classified Catapyrgus sororius as Nationally Critical under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. The species was judged as meeting the criteria for Nationally Critical threat status as a result of it occupying only in one location, the total area of which is less than 1 hectare.

The case is part of a one-step system and includes a catalytic disc to neutralise the peroxide over time. Hydrogen peroxide contact solutions are storage solutions for contact lenses that rely on hydrogen peroxide to clean the contacts and break up proteins and deposits during the disinfection process. Mechanism of action The majority of hydrogen peroxide solutions are 3% hydrogen peroxide. This enables the solution to break down any proteins that coat the contacts after a long period of use. Hydrogen peroxide is always used alongside a neutralizing product. The intention is to prevent the hydrogen peroxide from contact with the eye, which could damage the corneal cells in the epithelium. While this would not result in permanent damage, it can cause an intense burn that can linger even after an eye rinse. Burned cells heal very quickly once the natural tear film is restored. In order to prevent this damage, the solution must be stabilized before the contacts are placed into the individual's eyes. To stabilize the solution, the contacts are placed into a special container with a platinum coated disk. In solution, it gets rid of the hydrogen peroxide and produces small bubbles that help to clean the contacts. After a couple of hours, the hydrogen peroxide is stabilized and what is left is a saline solution. At this point, it is safe to use the contacts. After extended use, the platinum coated disk must be replaced. Hydrogen peroxide versus multipurpose solutions Both hydrogen peroxide and multipurpose solutions remove debris and build-up. Significant differences exist between the two. Hydrogen peroxide has the ability to penetrate microbial films, which helps create a deeper clean. Hydrogen peroxide solutions do not contain preservatives. This can be beneficial for people who are allergic or sensitive to the preservatives in multipurpose solutions. Hydrogen peroxide solutions have a greater ability to fight acanthamoeba keratitis, an infection that can cause blindness. Some researchers have found the peroxide cleaning regimen to encourage better contact lens care practices among peroxide users compared to multipurpose solution users. Multipurpose solutions tend to be less expensive. Contacts do not have to be placed in multipurpose solutions for extended intervals, whereas contacts must be left in a hydrogen peroxide solution for hours. The main attraction of multipurpose solutions is that the same solution can clean, rinse, disinfect and store lenses. Hydrogen peroxide solutions require a separate solution in order to rinse the contacts. Procedural mistakes put eyes at risk from contacting the hydrogen peroxide. Types Most hydrogen peroxide solutions cost around ten to twenty dollars. Three main name brands are available along with several generic products. The original brands were Softmate, Mirasept, Lensept, Oxysept I/II, IN a wink, and AOSept. Clear Care the current evolution of the old AOsept system is said to count for more than 80 percent of the hydrogen peroxide systems sold in the US. Clear Care contains a poloxamine derivative surfactant that helps loosen debris and deposits via a bubbling action and has a platinum disk that neutralizes the solution and is good for up to 100 uses. Prior to Clear Care, the market only provided a two step system where you first soaked the lenses in peroxide for a short period of time or overnight then replaced it with a neutralizing saline. These systems used a catalyse enzyme in saline form and was preserved. The AOSept system made by American Optical was the peroxide solution uses a disk to neutralize the solution. The Lensept system was also similar and used two different cups, one contained the disc and the other was for soaking. Oxysept and Omnicare was slightly different from the other two brands in that it uses tablets for the neutralization effect, which causes a slower process. The result of the tablets is a longer exposure to more concentrated hydrogen peroxide. Following recommendations to add an enzymatic cleaner weekly, increases costs.

The building is located at the University's Camperdown campus in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia and was officially opened on 30 April 2009. It serves as the new building for the Sydney Law School. Location As the first university established in Sydney, the University of Sydney was thoughtfully sited on a distinct rise overlooking the Sydney city, metaphorically placing learning and the investigation above the city. However this vision was seemingly lost in the pragmatics of post-war development. When the University decided to relocate the Law School, the Eastern Avenue site opposite the Anderson Stuart building (the Old Medical School) was chosen. As a result, two existing buildings, the Edgeworth David building and Stephen Roberts building, were demolished. The New Law School site sits on the edge of Victoria Park and is close to the University‚Äôs major historic buildings. Competition The University held an international invited design competition in 2003 for the New Law School. All contestants' presentations were public in order to reinforce open learning and research approach. Invited competitors included Axel Schultes Architekten in association with Stanisic Associates; Bligh Voller Nield; Donovan Hill/GHD/Wilson Architects; 3xNielsen; Foster and Partners/Hassell and FJMT. Design After winning the design competition in 2003, FJMT was commissioned to take charge of the New Law School's design. The architect aimed to use the project as an opportunity to \\"redefine and reinterpret the architectural dialectic between city and campus\\". The design focuses on extending the public domain in order to create a new opening between the University and the community. In particular, the study of law is balanced carefully at this new threshold. Landscaped public space outside the New Law School A public area with lawns, terraced landscapes and plazas is created at the level of Eastern Avenue, which is the major artery of the campus. FJMT believes that the public area is an \\"important contributor to the creation of campus life\\", therefore enhancing it becomes one of the major design priorities of the New Law School. As a result, movement is expanded out and about the site, as FJMT recognises the social experience of knowledge exchange to be gained through informal interaction of active social participation outside the classroom. The geometries of a rectangle, a circle and a triangle constitute the tectonic genesis for the New Law School‚Äôs design, where each form accommodates a set of functions. Split superstructures are suspended above that coalesce to frame new open spaces, and also serve as a new open entrance to the University. The suspended splintered fragments re- establish the topographical positioning of the University on a rise above the city. FJMT‚Äôs design divided the project into podium and superstructures. Layers of glass and timber louvres that are suspended on sleek stainless steel rods are used in defining the edge and opening of the splintered forms. View of the New Law School of the University of Sydney. A curvilinear \\"light-tower\\" made from stainless steel creates a sculptural form that figures against the silent backdrop of the existing Fisher Library. It draws attention to the presence to the new Law Library. According to Principal Johnathan Redman, the light-tower resembles \\"19th-century circular reading rooms with a lantern above\\". There is also a glass bridge that connects splintered forms of the New Law School, and serves as a social hub for students and the wider University community. The sense of transparency and openness introduced invites the public to participate in communication and discussion. The \\"light-tower\\" of the New Law School. Environmental performance The New Law School employs a double skin curtain wall, cavity facade system with operable louvers. This system creates a stack effect and regulates the interior thermally. The louvres change according to the position of the sun or preferences of the building's inhabitants. The harsh daylight is therefore softened when it is filtered into the interior space. This system also allows variation in light and shade, blocking harsh glare and heat while preserving and directing views. In addition, natural air circulation is concerned through the interior, tempering the environment as it is needed. On the other hand, the double skin glass serves as an acoustic barrier to noises from the busy City Road, so that inhabitants can engage in quiet activities without disturbance. To ensure daylight reaches the levels below ground, the podium is punctuated with triple-laminated glass. In addition, the 20-meter-tall light tower, which is directly above the Law Library's main reading room, reflects natural daylight through skylights and clerestories, and also draws out stale air. Facilities The building‚Äôs main 300-seat auditorium is used to hold major public lectures and seminars. Its \\"in-the-round\\" configuration, where the lecturer is surrounded by audiences who sit no more than five rows from them, creates an intimate environment which encourages active participation. This configuration is also carried out in the four 100-seat lecture theatres. Sixteen seminar rooms and other meeting facilities are also designed as teaching spaces that accommodate smaller groups. Their flexible flat-floor design enable multiple configurations to accommodate different learning methodologies, from traditional lectures to group discussions. Dispute resolution facilities including a Moot Court, mediation break-out rooms and judges‚Äô chambers are also provided for students to simulate court proceedings, therefore allowing them to take part in practical experience of the arts of advocacy, persuasion and problem solving. Additionally, there are office spaces and facilities that are dedicated to the student representative body as well as doctrine and masters research students. Public recognition The project has received various awards from national institutions, such as the Australian Institute of Building and Australian Institute of Architects.

On 10 August 1881 the name of Hinderaa municipality was changed by royal resolution to Nerstrand. Later, between 1910 and 1920 the spelling was changed slightly to Nedstrand to better match the local pronunciation. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.

The link code comprises decimal digits and its length is defined for each service. The check digit contains one decimal digit calculated from the service code and the link code. It is used for error detection.  Display  An ISLI code shall be shown in the format \\" ISLI XXXXXX-XXXXX-X\\". The hyphen is used for separating the three fields (service code, link code and check digit) and the word \\"ISLI\\" must be prefixed.  Administration  The ISLI system is administered by the ISLI Registration Authority(ISLI RA). And the International Information Content Industry Association (ICIA), a not-for-profit organization headquartered in Hong Kong, acts as the ISLI Registration Authority. ICIA is responsible for the maintenance of the ISLI system and other responsibilities specified in the ISLI standard.  Benefits  The ISLI standard provides a way of linking entities without changing the properties of those entities, e.g. ownership, access rights and identifiers that are used to identify those entities.  Obtaining a service code  To obtain a service code, the following procedures shall be followed: Decide the type of the specific link application. Search the list of link types in the ISLI RA Website to find the desired link type. Draw up the operational plan. Submit application for a service code, and specify the data access rights when registering metadata. Build the Service Provider Application and provide services to users.

History The fountain was built in the 13th century by the Guild of the Wool-makers (Lana). The first mention of a fountain was in 1081, and documents speak of enlargement by Bellamino in 1193, and finally rebuilt in its present form in 1246. The fountain is cited by Dante Alighieri in the Divine Comedy (Inferno - Canto trentesimoInferno XXX, vv. 76-78). Structure The fountain front has three Gothic arches and a crenellated roof. The roof spans a tank fed by water traveling for kilometers to reach the city. The structure was so large, due to multiple use: to get drinking water for men and, separately, for animals, and to wash clothes, especially the textiles made by Arte della Lana (Guild of Wool-makers).

Moore‚Äôs photographs employ the formal vocabularies of architectural and landscape photography and the narrative approaches of documentary photography and journalism to detail remnants of societies in transition. His photographic essays have been published in monographs, anthologies, and magazines including The New York Times Magazine, Time, The New Yorker, National Geographic, Harper‚Äôs Magazine, The New York Review of Books, Fortune, Wired, and Art in America. Moore‚Äôs video work has been featured on PBS and MTV; his feature-length documentary about the artist Ray Johnson, ‚ÄúHow to Draw a Bunny,‚Äù won the Special Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. Moore teaches in the MFA Photography, Video and Related Media program at the School of Visual Arts in New York. Early life Andrew Lambdin Moore, born March 26, 1957, grew up in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. His father Sydney Hart Moore, was a commercial architect, and his mother Patricia Lambdin Moore, was an editor at the New York Graphic Society, a fine art publisher. Moore‚Äôs parents supported his early interest in photography; his father built him an attic darkroom and his mother introduced him to the works of Peter Beard, whose book, Eyelids of the Morning, a study of Nile crocodiles on Lake Rudolf, was being published by NYGS. Beard learned of Moore‚Äôs interest in photography and signed two prints to him from this series. Moore is related to the Victorian era artists George Cochran Lambdin, known for his paintings of flowers, and Alfred A. Hart, an official photographer for the Central Pacific Railroad, who documented the construction of the western half of the first transcontinental railroad. In 1975, Moore enrolled at Princeton University, where he worked on an independent major in photography under the guidance and mentorship of the historian Peter Bunnell and the photographer Emmet Gowin, who at the time, was completing his first monograph. During that time, Moore also had the benefit of working with visiting artists including Frederick Sommer, Jim Dow, and Joel Meyerowitz. Moore graduated summa cum laude in 1979. Early career After a brief stint working with commercial photographers in New York City, Moore moved to New Orleans, where he continued a body of work first started for his senior thesis. Over the next two years, he focused on the city‚Äôs disappearing commercial district, where he found subjects such as a coffin workshop, a broom factory, and a raw furrier‚Äìplaces employing artisans and out-dated machinery. The New Orleans Downtown Development District awarded Moore a grant which enabled him to produce a portfolio of one-hundred 8x10 color contact prints, which were placed in the city‚Äôs archives. In 1981, Moore returned to New York City, where he began a three-year project documenting the rapid changes to the urban landscape, specifically at the South Street Seaport and Fulton Fish Market in lower Manhattan. At the start of his project, demolition for the present marketplace and shopping pier was just getting under way. Moore returned many times over the following months, often photographing at night to portray the architecture and ambiance of the surrounding neighborhood amidst massive, rapid transformation. For this work, Moore and two other photographers, Barbara Mensch and Jeff Perkell, were awarded grants from the JM Kaplan Foundation, and the New York State Council on the Arts, which enabled the completed project, ‚ÄúSouth Street Survey‚Äù to be shown at the Municipal Art Society in 1985. During this time, Moore was also working on a series of photographs of grain elevators in Buffalo, New York with the assistance of a NYSCA individual grant. In Buffalo, Moore met a group of artists working with appropriated imagery, which inspired him to begin using mechanical and chemical processes to incorporate multiple negatives, paintings, drawings, and xeroxes into complex montage images outside of strict documentary practice. This method of recombination, in the era before Photoshop, created images of ‚Äúconvulsive beauty‚Äù and were the subject of Moore‚Äôs first solo exhibition in New York at Lieberman and Saul Gallery in 1986, following his first solo show at Real Art Ways in Hartford, CT in 1985. Moore continued this method of montaging imagery for the next 7 years, expanding his practice into experimental short films. During this time, Moore collaborated on short films with others including the artists Lee Breuer and David Byrne. His film ‚ÄúNosferatu‚Äù 1989 was nationally broadcast on MTV and PBS‚Äôs New Television series. Mid-career =42nd Street= In 1995, Moore returned to his roots in documentary practice as the texture of New York‚Äôs 42nd Street was rapidly changing. With all of the theaters between 7th and 8th avenues scheduled to be razed or refurbished, Moore sought permission to photograph the torn seats and faded fire curtains which told the stories of those spaces. In 1997, Moore showed these photographs at Yancey Richardson Gallery in New York. Despite his change of style, the work was well received; in a review for The New Yorker, Andrew Long noted, ‚ÄúThe straight forward treatment is a departure for the photographer, who characteristically produces multi-image evocations of New York City. Nothing is lost however‚Äî his earlier poetic constructs now give way to broader arenas for the imagination to roam.‚Äù =Cuba= Moore first traveled to Cuba in 1998 to photograph Havana‚Äôs decaying theaters. The project soon expanded in scope to document the larger effects of Cuba‚Äôs permanent Revolution, which were particularly apparent during the economic depression known as the ‚ÄúPer√≠odo especial.‚Äù Moore‚Äôs large- scale color photographs of Havana reveal an elegant but crumbling metropolis of muted pastel interiors, courtyards, and scenes of daily life. Moore returned to photograph Cuba‚Äôs architecture and environment over the next 14 years, in the process publishing two monographs Inside Havana (Chronicle Books, 2002) and Cuba (Damiani, 2012). Moore has said his work intends to show, ‚Äúhow contemporary history, and specifically cultures in transition, are expressed through architecture.‚Äù The photographer Julius Shulman wrote of Inside Havana, ‚ÄúExhibited throughout Moore‚Äôs work is a genuine flavor of ‚Äòpresence‚Äô. He does not attempt to gloss over questionable conditions, nor does he try to contort reality. With tremendous sensitivity, Moore creates art statements of the architecture he shows us. His images are painterly and poetic.‚Äù Moore‚Äôs photographs from Cuba appeared as a cover story in the September 23, 2012 issue of The New York Times Magazine. =Russia= While working in Cuba, Moore became interested in the island nation‚Äôs long relationship with Russia. This led him to photograph the architectural environments where Russian history and politics collide in unexpected ways. Between 2000 and 2004 Moore made 8 trips around Russia from St. Petersburg to the remotest parts of the country. The New Yorker wrote of the work, ‚Äúin taking Russia‚Äìits contradictions and gorgeous ruins‚Äìat face value, he captures a country‚Äôs diversity and history.‚Äù For example, Moore photographed a ‚Äúczarist church [that] was turned into a soap factory during the Soviet period, and now has been restored into a kind of youth center.‚Äù Moore remarked, ‚ÄúFor me these kinds of subjects present a cross section through time: they address Russia‚Äôs complex past, as well as the larger compacting and collapsing processes of contemporary history.‚Äù In 2004, Moore published the monograph Russia Beyond Utopia (Chronicle Books, 2004). =How to Draw a Bunny= From 1995-2001, Moore produced and photographed the film ‚ÄúHow to Draw a Bunny: A Ray Johnson Portrait,‚Äù a collage-style feature-length documentary about the Detroit-born pop and performance artist Ray Johnson. Moore worked with the director and editor John Walter to delve into the mysterious life and death of Johnson, an artist whose ‚Äúworld was made up of amazing coincidences, serendipities and karmic gags,‚Äù according to Michael Kimmelman of The New York Times. After Johnson‚Äôs suicide, Moore and Walter conducted interviews with artists including Christo, Chuck Close, Roy Lichtenstein, Judith Malina, and James Rosenquist. In addition, they gathered photographs, works of art, and home movies, which were edited into a fast-paced narrative exploring the artist‚Äôs life. The filmmakers ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt have chosen a more elusive subject for a movie; their success in evoking Johnson, and in documenting his world, is a triumph of sympathy over psychology, memory over historicism,‚Äù wrote Stuart Klawans for The Nation. The film premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Special Jury Prize. The film also won the Grand Prix du Public 2002 at the Rencontres Internationales de Cinema in Paris and was nominated for a 2003 Independent Spirit Award and listed in New York Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop Ten of 2004.‚Äù =Detroit= In 2008 and 2009, Moore traveled to Detroit to portray in photographs ‚Äúthe idea that in an urban setting you could also have a landscape happening, the forces of nature intersecting with American urbanism, the process of decline also intersecting with the revival of nature.‚Äù In 2010, Moore released Detroit Disassembled (Damiani, 2010), with an introduction by Detroit-native and Poet Laureate Philip Levine, to coincide with an exhibition at the Akron Art Museum. He was originally invited to document the city by two young French photographers, , who had been photographing Detroit‚Äôs abandoned spaces since 2005. While Moore‚Äôs Detroit series follows the themes of transformation and decaying space explored in previous bodies of work, his focus on the motor city generated controversy in the pages of The New Republic and the journal Guernica. The photographs were decried as ‚Äúruin porn,‚Äù which Mike Rubin defined in The New York Times as ‚Äúurban decay as empty clich√©, smacking of voyeurism and exploitation.‚Äù Curator Sarah Kennel writes in The Memory of Time, an exhibition catalog from the National Gallery of Art, that, ‚Äúin Moore‚Äôs photographs, ruination serves more explicitly as an allegory of modernity‚Äôs failure.‚Äù Other critics argue that whether or not Moore‚Äôs Detroit photographs fit the category of ‚Äúruin porn‚Äù is a matter of academic debate. Joseph Stanhope Cialdella argues in the journal Environmental History that Moore‚Äôs work instead conveys the ‚Äúaesthetic of a postindustrial sublime‚Äù which ‚Äúgives nature the authority to transform the image of Detroit into a novel, yet disturbing landscape that blurs the lines between wilderness and the city.‚Äù Dora Apel writes in Beautiful Terrible Ruins that Moore‚Äôs ‚Äúpictures of Detroit tend to emphasize the relationship of nature and culture, with nature in the ascendancy.‚Äù Apel ultimately argues that the ‚Äúruin porn‚Äù images and debate fail to focus on the political and economic policies that are the root causes of the ruins. =Dirt Meridian= From 2005 to 2014, Moore photographed the people and landscape of ‚Äúgreat American Desert,‚Äù which roughly includes the area west of the 100th meridian to the Rocky Mountains, from Texas north to Canada. The area is one of the most sparsely populated regions in the country, ‚Äúwhere the daily reality is often defined by drought and hardship.‚Äù To make many of the photographs, Moore collaborated with Doug Dean, the pilot of a single-engine aircraft, to create bird‚Äôs-eye perspectives revealing the vastness of the land. Rather than flying high above the plains, Moore chose perspectives that have ‚Äúthe sense of being within the landscape rather than above it.‚Äù For an essay accompanying Moore‚Äôs photographs in The New York Times Magazine, Inara Verzemnieks wrote, ‚ÄúFrom above, the land is like one endless, unpunctuated idea ‚Äî sand, tumbleweed, turkey, bunch stem, buffalo, meadow, cow, rick of hay, creek, sunflower, sand ‚Äî and only rarely did a house or a windmill or a barn suddenly appear to suspend the sense of limitlessness.‚Äù On the ground, Moore photographed the people who inhabit this unforgiving landscape and the evidence of their efforts, from active homesteads to abandoned schoolhouses. These photographs are published in Moore‚Äôs newest monograph: Dirt Meridian (Damiani, 2015). Teaching Since 2004, Moore has taught a graduate seminar in the MFA Photography, Video, and Related Media program at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. He lectured on photography at Princeton University from 2001 to 2010. Personal life Moore lives in New York City with his wife, two daughters, and son. Publications * Inside Havana.

The piazza stands at the northernmost end of Via Cavour, Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. Arca di Lorena The arch was begun after 1737 to welcome the January 1739 arrival of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty; it was past this arch that the same dynasty was to leave for exile in 1859.Guida per osservare con metodo le rarit√† e bellezze della citt√† di Firenze, 11th edition, Presso Guglielmo Piatti, Florence 1819, page 55. History The arch has emanated a foreign aura since its erection in 1737‚Äì1739 by the newly-arrived French architect, Jean Nicolas Jadot, to welcome the arrival (or visit) of the new ruler Francis Stephen, former Duke of Lorraine.Florence: A Walking Guide to Its Architecture, by Richard J. Goy, (2015); page 22. Some sources add the efforts of Francesco Schamant of Lorraine to the design.Guida, Guiglielmo Piatti, 1819. The statuary was not added until 1744. However, many ephemeral decorations including tapestries were used along Via San Gallo to welcome the ruler in January 1739. This new duke's stay in Florence was short lived as he quickly moved to Vienna to become emperor. The next duke, Francis' second son, Viennese-born Leopold, would not be named duke until 1765, when he moved to Florence with his Spanish-born wife. The Arch rises in a park formed by Piazza della Liberta; the arch is just centripetal to the now detached Porta San Gallo, once the main northern gate of the city. The park is located in an island surrounded by a series of homogenous porticoed palaces, designed by Giuseppe Poggi in the 19th century, who also landscaped the park.Florence: A Walking Guide to Its Architecture, by Richard J. Goy, (2015); page 22.Gardens of Florence, by Mariella Zoppi, Page 85. The arch has three openings, a larger central one with two smaller lateral ones. The arch is bedecked with ten columns with Corinthian capitals. Most of the sculptures and reliefs were requisitioned locally. It has bas-reliefs celebrating the imperial role in Italy, along with depictions of flags and weapons. The southern facade has two double-headed eagles, the symbol of the Habsburg dynasty. Atop the arch is an equestrian statue, putatively of Francis Stephen himself, apparently marching out of the city. Atop the apparently safe perch of the plinth, cringe nearly a half-dozen allegorical mythologic statues, as if they were the last Austrian contingent in Tuscany, besieged by the swirling Italian traffic around the park. It is said that crowds in 1859 belittled the fleeing Duke Leopold II as the second Baby Leopold, the prior one entering Florence under regency.

P. eocenica is one of six Lutetian Pachycondyla species. History and classification When described, Pachycondyla eocenica was known from two fossil insects which are compression- impression fossils preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well-preserved insect fossils, the P. eocenica specimens were collected from layers of the Lutetian Messel pit World Heritage Site. The formation is composed of brown coals, oil shales, and bituminous shale, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial mammals as a notable lagerst√§tten. The area is a preserved maar lake which initially formed approximately 47 million years ago as the result of volcanic explosions. At the time of description, the holotype specimen, number SMF MeI 10999, was preserved in the Senckenberg Research Station Messel fossil collections. The fossils were described by Gennady Dlussky and Sonja Wedmann in a 2012 paper on the poneromorph ants of Messel. The specific epithet \\"eocenica\\" is derived from the Eocene age of the fossil. The species is one of six Pachycondyla species which have been described from Messel Formation fossils. All six of the species were described by Dlussky and Wedmann in the same 2012 paper, the other five being P. lutzi, P.? messeliana, P. parvula, P. petiolosa, and P. petrosa. Another eight fossil species have been described from fossils in North America, Europe, and Asia. Description The Pachycondyla eocenica holotype specimen is a partially preserved adult queen, which was fossilized as a lateral impression, missing portions of the legs and wings. The paratype is a very partial dorsal impression, preserving only the head, either of a gyne or a worker. The overall length of the queen is approximately and the head has an estimated length of . The antennae are slender in appearance, composed of a scape which extends nearly to the edge of the rear margin of the head. The eyes are rounded in outline and placed to the front of the midpoint on the head. The shape of the petiole scale is rounded on the top edge, as is that of both P. messeliana and P. succinea, but it is larger than P. succinea and smaller than P. messeliana.

Unlike baroque sonatas for solo instrument and continuo, where the realisation of the figured bass was left to the discretion of the performer, the keyboard part in the sonatas was almost entirely specified by Bach. They were probably mostly composed during Bach's final years in C√∂then between 1720 and 1723, before he moved to Leipzig. The extant sources for the collection span the whole of Bach's period in Leipzig, during which time he continued to make changes to the score.  Origins and compositional history  Title page from 1725 manuscript of BWV 1014‚Äì1019.The title page was written by Bach's nephew Wilhelm Friedrich Bach with an annotation by his son Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach. It reads Sounate √¢ Cembalo [con]certato √® Violino Solo, col Basso per Viola da Gamba accompagnato se piace. Composte da Giov: Sebast: Bach Bach's sonatas for violin and obbligato harpsichord were composed in trio sonata form, i.e. three independent parts consisting of two equally matched upper voices above a bass line. Instead of playing the role of a continuo instrument, filling in the harmonies of a figured bass, the harpsichord took one of the upper melodic lines on equal terms with the violin, whilst also providing the bass line (which could be reinforced if desired by the addition of a viola da gamba). In the totality of Bach's musical output, the instrumental sonatas written in trio sonata form are small in number. Apart from the BWV 1014‚Äì1019, there are the six organ sonatas, BWV 525‚Äì530, the three sonatas for viola da gamba and harpsichord, BWV 1027‚Äì1029, and the three sonatas for flute and harpsichord, BWV 1030, BWV 1031 and BWV 1032. In each case the trio sonata texture derives from the compositional form and not the particular combination of instruments, which was partly a function of the musicians at Bach's disposal. This is well illustrated by the first movement of the organ sonata BWV 528 which originated as the sinfonia starting the second part of the cantata, BWV 76, with oboe d'amore and viola da gamba as solo instruments; and likewise by the trio sonata for two flutes and continuo BWV 1039 and its alternative version for viola da gamba and obbligato harpsichord, BWV 1027. Although it had been believed for some time‚Äîand advanced as a theory by ‚Äîthat the sonatas BWV 1014‚Äì1019 must have originated in lost trio sonatas for two instruments and continuo, no prior versions have been discovered and it is accepted that only a few movements could have such an origin. The first known source from 1725, in the handwriting of Bach's nephew Johann Heinrich Bach, explicitly specifies an obbligato harpsichord; and, despite the fact that a later version in the hand of Bach's pupil Johann Friedrich Agricola has a marginal \\"Violin I\\" at the start of BWV 1014, the scoring of the upper part in the keyboard, especially in the adagio movements BWV 1016/i, BWV 1017/iii and BWV 1018/iii, uses figures that are idiomatic to a keyboard instrument but unsuited to other instruments. Although this compositional style became widespread in the late eighteenth century, in Bach's day it was unusual and innovative. Although all the sonatas are written in trio sonata form, each has its own distinct character‚Äîthe third is an example of the Sonate auf Concertenart, a sonata written in the style of a concerto.See: Throughout his life Bach returned to the sonatas to refine and perfect the score, particularly in the last sonata, which survives in three different versions. Johann Georg Schreiber, 1720: Engraving of Katherinenstrasse in Leipzig. In the centre is Caf√© Zimmermann, where the Collegium Musicum held weekly chamber music concerts When Wolfgang Schmieder created the chronology for the BWV catalogue of Bach's works in the 1950s, the assumption was that Bach's musical output matched his responsibilities in each of the three distinct phases in his career: the period 1700‚Äì1717 when he was organist at L√ºneburg, Arnstadt, M√ºhlhausen and Weimar; the period 1717‚Äì1723 when he was Capellmeister at C√∂then; and the period from 1723 onwards when he served as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Accordingly, the chamber music works by Bach were automatically assigned to the C√∂then period. Later generations of Bach scholars have recognized that Bach's involvement with chamber and orchestral music continued in Leipzig, especially through the Collegium Musicum; and accordingly Schmieder's rigid chronology is no longer generally accepted. Nevertheless, even though there is no direct confirmation for the dating of BWV 1014‚Äì1019, Bach scholars agree that the circumstances surrounding the 1725 source probably point to the first versions of these sonatas being composed between 1720 and 1723 during Bach's last years in C√∂then. In the 1958 Neue Bach-Ausgabe edition, the editor and musicologist Rudolf Gerber was unaware that the 1725 manuscript had been largely copied by Bach's nephew, who was only a pupil at the Thomasschule at the time. In addition two of the three last movements in the sixth sonata copied by Bach himself were borrowed from the sixth keyboard partita BWV 830, movements also included in the 1725 Notenb√ºchlein for Bach's wife Anna Magdalena Bach. This suggests that the initial collection of sonatas, assembled for an unknown purpose, was probably copied from pre-existing compositions and hastily completed. This hypothesis is not only compatible with Bach's heavy compositional duties as Thomaskantor at the start of his period in Leipzig; but also agrees with the dating of the sonatas to C√∂then by Bach's biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel: a letter to him in 1774 from Bach's son Carl Philip Emmanuel describes the sonatas as being 50 years old.See:  The history of the sixth sonata BWV 1019 is distinct from that of the five others. The three different versions of the sonata and its successive comprehensive modifications in Leipzig indicate that its role in the collection evolved only gradually. The two first movements, a large scale concerto allegro and a short largo, remained largely unaltered throughout these revisions and were copied by Bach's nephew Johann Heinrich into the earliest surviving manuscript from 1725. The originals, assumed to date from C√∂then, are lost; but it is probable that these were the first two movements of a three-movement Sonate auf Concertenart. In the 1725 manuscript the remaining movements were entered by Bach himself. The sonata took the following form: # Vivace, G major # Largo, E minor # Harpsichord solo, E minor # Adagio, B minor and G minor # Violin solo with figured bass, G minor # Vivace, G major (repeat of opening movement) The solo movements provide a contrast with the other movements, which are duos for violin and obbligato harpsichord; moreover as dance movements they add variety and lightness to the set, making it more like a dance suite. The harpsichord solo was later published in Bach's Clavier-√úbung I as the Corrente in BWV 830, the sixth of the keyboard partitas; before that it had already been entered into Anna Magdalena's Notebook. The violin solo, with the harpsichord providing a simple figured bass accompaniment, was an early version of the Tempo di Gavotta from the same partita. Only the harpsichord part survives, but the violin solo for the fifth movement has been reconstructed without difficulty from the score of BWV 830; the missing violin part for the short Adagio has been recovered from the second version of the sonata. After the publication of Clavier-√úbung I, probably in the late 1720s, Bach revised the sixth sonata by excising the two published movements from BWV 830. He replaced the harpsichord solo by a lengthy Cantabile for violin and obbligato harpsichord: # Vivace, G major # Largo, E minor # Cantabile, G major # Adagio, B minor and G minor The third movement is considered to be an arrangement of an aria from a lost secular cantata, probably dating from Bach's period in C√∂then. There is no longer any indication that the opening Vivace should be repeated in performance; the lack of a fast finale returning to the original key has been taken as an indication of the unfinished or intermediate status of this version. The sonata attained its final form some time between 1729 and 1741 and survives in a copy made by Bach's pupil Johann Friedrich Agricola. Now with five movements and matching more closely the earlier five sonatas, it retained the first two movements (with some minor modifications, including \\"Vivace\\" changed to \\"Allegro\\") but had three newly composed movements after that: a dance-like harpsichord solo in E minor in binary form; an Adagio in B minor, modulating to D major; and a gigue-like final Allegro in G major.See: *too *  Musical structure  The first musical description of the sonatas for obbligato harpsichord and violin BWV 1014‚Äì1019 appeared in . In the 1960s Hans Eppstein made a systematic analysis of all the sonatas for obbligato keyboard and melody instrument, including the six organ sonatas, BWV 525‚Äì530. He determined common features in their compositional forms; part of his aim was to investigate their possible origins as transcriptions of lost compositions for chamber ensemble. Because of the complex history of BWV 1019, with its five movements and two previous versions, Eppstein gives his analysis for the first five sonatas BWV 1014‚Äì1018, viewing the movements of the sixth sonata as hybrid forms. The movements of the three versions of BWV 1019 will be discussed separately in its own section below. The five sonatas BWV 1014‚Äì1018 are all in four movements in the conventions of the sonata da chiesa, with a slow first movement, followed by a fast movement, then another slow movement before the final allegro, often having a joyful or witty dance-like character. pointed out a uniform structure in the fast movements. They are all fugal in form but can be divided into two distinct and readily identifiable types: *Tutti fugue. Contrary to Eppstein's choice of name, these do not start off with a \\"tutti\\" section: they commence with the fugue subject in one of the upper parts (violin or right hand of the harpsichord), accompanied by a non-thematic accompaniment in the bass, which can be a bare bass line or a figured bass. The fugue subject is then taken up by the other upper part and finally in the bass. These movements have countersubjects, solo episodes, fugal development sections and a ritornello at the close. *Concerto allegro. These follow the model of the fast movements of the concertos of Antonio Vivaldi. Like dances, they have a binary form, i.e. are written in two sections which can be repeated (most often only the first section is repeated). All parts play together at the beginning and there are solo episodes; the subject and countersubject are in invertible counterpoint, so can be permuted between the parts. In general the first fast movements of the sonatas are written as tutti fugues and the closing movements as concerto allegros. There are two exceptions: in the fifth sonata BWV 1018 in F minor, the first fast movement is a concerto allegro and the closing allegro is a tutti fugue; and in the third sonata BWV 1016 in E major both allegros are tutti fugues. Both fast movements are usually linked by the musical form of their subjects. Although the binary form of the concerto allegro is usually described as \\"dance-like\\", unlike other movements of this form discussed in detail by , no specific dance forms have been associated to individual movements. The slow movements by contrast are united only by their diversity. The violin and keyboard play different roles and there are often more than two voices in the upper parts, which can divide in the keyboard part or have double stopping in the violin. Bach explored all possibilities in the slow movements: they can resemble movements from every variety of baroque musical genre, including concertos, chamber works, dance suites, cantatas or accompanied arias; and the textures in the keyboard and the violin were often new departures, quite distinct from previously known compositions. Unlike the fast movements, there is no longer an equality between the two upper parts and the bass, which plays a continuo role. Sometimes the bass has its own theme, as in BWV 1014/1, where it produces a partial ostinato effect; in BWV 1014/3, BWV 1016/3 and BWV 1017/3, the bass line is a genuine ostinato. The upper keyboard part can have an independent structure from the other voices: that happens in the broken chord semiquavers or triplets that give Bach's predetermined realisation of a figured bass in the slow movements of BWV 1017; and also in BWV 1016/1 where it is divided into three voices. In the accompanying keyboard ritornello of the first movement of the F minor sonata BWV 1018, the two parts in the upper keyboard and the bass line share the same material which is echoed imitatively between them; in the third movement of the same sonata, the filigree demisemiquaver scale figures in the right hand are responded to by demisemiquaver arpeggios in the left hand. In a few exceptional movements the upper keyboard part is directly related to the violin part: in BWV 1015/3, the two upper parts play in strict canon over broken semiquaver chords in the bass; in BWV 1016/3 in trio sonata form, the two upper parts share the same material, with invertible counterpoint and imitation; in BWV 1014/3, the right hand part adds an imitative subordinate voice to the melody line in the violin, often accompanying in thirds. In BWV 1014/1 and BWV 1016/1, there are instances when the violin and upper keyboard respond to each other, with one borrowing the thematic material of the other. In these last two movements the violin and the upper keyboard are equally matched partners. In the majority of slow movements, however, the role of the upper keyboard part is subordinate to that of the violin and‚Äîalthough composed with independent material‚Äîserves the function of providing an obbligato accompaniment.See:   = No. 1 in B minor BWV 1014 = *Adagio *Allegro *Andante *Allegro = No. 2 in A major BWV 1015 = *[Andante] *Allegro *Andante un poco *Presto = No. 3 in E major BWV 1016 = *Adagio *Allegro *Adagio ma non tanto *Allegro = No. 4 in C minor BWV 1017 = *Largo 600px The opening Largo of BWV 1017 in time is a Siciliano, a binary dance-form widely used in the early eighteenth century. In the minor key it was associated with a mood of melancholy or even pathos. The elegiac melodic line and ornamentation are entirely suited to the violin. As numerous commentators have pointed out, with its affecting anapaests, the compositional style and impassioned tone resemble those of the obbligato violin solo in the celebrated alto aria \\"Erbarme dich\\" from Bach's St. Matthew Passion. The harpsichord supplies a continuo-like accompaniment. There are arpeggiated semiquaver figures in the harpsichord right hand, while the quavers in the left hand‚Äîwith their French tenue slurs gradually descending in steps‚Äîprovide a rhythmic pulse gently driving the movement forward, almost like an ostinato bass.See:  The slur was described by in 1702. It indicates that all notes but the last under the slur are to be held slightly longer than their marked duration. * *Allegro The second movement of BWV 1017 in common time is a \\"concerto allegro\\" according to Eppstein's classification. 109 bars long, has described it as \\"a mammoth compendium of musical ideas all somehow integrated into one of the most intensive fugal movements Bach ever wrote.\\" The movement is built on a ritornello which contains both a fugue subject and a countersubject. New material is also introduced in a brief two bar interlude a third of the way through the movement. The ritornello, or parts of it, recurs ten times in the movement, which it also concludes. The fugue subject is heard in C minor and G minor, and their relative major keys, E major and B major; further complexity is added by reprises starting in the middle of a bar. Musical material from the ritornello and interlude is developed extensively in the many intervening episodes. 900px In the opening ritornello of bars (see above) the fugue subject is first heard in the harpsichord, then the violin and finally in the bass line, when it is accompanied for two bars by the first statement of the countersubject‚Äîa rising sequence of repeated notes and trills‚Äîin the harpsichord. This is followed by the first episode of bars in which motifs from the ritornello are developed between the upper parts in imitative responses and in parallel: rhythmic figures from the fugue subject are played in counterpoint to semiquaver passagework; and elsewhere the upper parts respond to each with trills. The ritornello then returns for seven bars with the fugue subject in the harpsichord. After the cadence, a pivotal two bar interlude introduces new motifs in all the parts: 700px In the upper parts a tightly phrased semiquaver figure ornamented with a demisemiquaver dactyl is heard in the harpsichord, then in a response in the violin and finally in the harpsichord where it leads into a cadence. This is accompanied in the bass line by new rising figures made up of chromatic fourths. As comments, although this new material is quite different from that of the ritornello, Bach subsequently relates it to the ritornello: in the two bar reprise of the fugue subject of the ritornello at the cadence, chromatic fourths are included first in the descending left hand of the harpsichord; and in the next bar they are then heard as a rising quaver motif in the right hand, forming a new countersubject. This four bar passage is immediately repeated with the upper parts exchanged. For the remainder of the movement, Bach ingeniously permutes all the musical material at his disposal, with thematic passages from the ritornello interspersed with more elaborately developed variants of previous episodes. Between two bridging episodes, the ritornello theme returns in the violin but now starting in the middle of a bar. The fugue theme is heard again in the bass line accompanied by the countersubject in the violin; the fugue subject then passes to the violin starting mid-bar; and finally it is heard in the upper keyboard of the harpsichord. After a further extended concertino-like episode revisiting the trilling exchanges from the beginning of the movement, the ritornello theme returns mid-bar in the left hand of the harpsichord, accompanied by the countersubject in the right hand. With the upper parts exchanged, there is a repeat of the dactylic interlude along with its eight bar sequel. It is linked by a brief quasi-stretto section to a three bar cadenza-like passage over a pedal point, leading directly into the concluding eight bar ritornello, its opening marked by the rising chromatic fourth figure in the bass line.See:  * *Adagio 800px In the Adagio in triple time, the violin plays the cantabile melodic line in dotted rhythms in its lower and middle registers as if an alto solo. At first declamatory in the forte passages, the piano responses are expressive but subdued. Bach's knowledge of the expressive qualities of the violin is shown in the opening phrases, written so they can be played on the G string, the lowest string on the violin, regarded as having a \\"noble\\" tone. As explains, citing the opening of BWV 1017/3 as an example, the G string's \\"energy and powerful voice make it a whole instrument in itself and the lower this voice is, the more opportunity it gives to expression to attain the sublime.\\" Around the violin melody, in the same registers, the right hand keyboard part weaves a dreamy accompaniment of broken chords in triplets. Below them the bass part punctuates the melody with a fragmented continuo-like accompaniment in quavers and crotchets. As comments, the complex and contrasting juxtaposition of rhythms, if played as annotated, has a magical effect. In the course of the movement there are six forte phrases of increasing complexity and length in the violin part each followed by a proportionate piano response. In the concluding four bar coda, the violin and harpsichord play semiquaver figures imitatively as the tonality modulates to G major, leading into the final Allegro. describes the mood of the movement as \\"verinnerlichte und vergeistigte\\"‚Äîinward-looking and spiritual.See:   Allegro 800px The final Allegro of BWV 1017 is a spirited dance-like \\"tutti fugue\\" in binary form. Like the last movements of BWV 1014 and the first organ sonata BWV 525, it follows the same plan as the fugal gigues in Bach's keyboard partitas, BWV 825‚Äì830; namely in the second part of the binary movement, the fugue subject is inverted. Following , the structure of the first part can be described as follows. The fugue subject is first played by the harpsichord in the first four bars. In the next four bars it is taken up by the violin while the harpsichord plays the countersubject. Before the bass plays the theme, there are two linked interludes. The main one is four bars long with the violin playing material based on the fugue subject, while the harpsichord plays characteristic two bar motifs which Eppstein describes as \\"fountain-like\\". These are made up of semiquaver triad motifs leaping upwards before descending in the semiquaver figures of the countersubject. The second interlude of three bars has both parts playing these semiquaver figures in parallel. The material from both episodes is then ingeniously developed. Eventually a four bar passage of semiquaver scales in the harpsichord part leads to a cadence and then a reprise of the second interlude, before a fourth and final statement of the subject and countersubject. The first part then concludes with an emphatic rendition of the two interludes in the violin and harpsichord. The second part of BWV 1017/4 starts as follows: 1000px Although parallel to the first part, the second part is not a straightforward inversion (it is ten bars longer with 64 bars instead of 54). Only the fugue subject and countersubject are inverted. Both are also transformed in other ways: the first by adding intermediate notes and removing some repeated notes which change its rhythmic character to a more continuous melodic line; and diminution is introduced in the countersubject, now playfully scored in syncopated groups of three semiquavers instead of four (see the 5th bar above). The second part starts with the (modified) fugue subject in the violin; followed by the subject in the harpsichord and the countersubject in the violin. As in the first part, there is a reprise of both interludes followed by a statement of the fugue subject/countersubject in the bass line/harpsichord, but now truncated from four bars to three. This is followed by an episode developing the material of the interlude, followed by the truncated fugue subject/countersubject in the harpsichord/violin. There is then a reprise of the episode with cascading semiquaver scales which leads this time into a fifth statement of the truncated fugue subject/countersubject in the violin/harpsichord. It is followed by the second interlude and a sixth and last statement of the truncated fugue subject/countersubject in the bass line/violin. This is immediately juxtaposed with the return of the original (uninverted 4 bar) fugue subject and countersubject in the harpsichord and violin, leading into a concluding restatement of the rhythmic eight bar interlude.See:   = No. 5 in F minor BWV 1018 = * [Largo] * Allegro * Adagio * Vivace = No. 6 in G major BWV 1019 = The three stages in the evolution of Sonata N0. 6 in G major are described in great detail in the section \\"Origins and compositional history\\", *Allegro 700px The opening movement is a concerto allegro in G major and common time. This already sets the sonata apart from the previous sonatas, which like the sonatas da chiesa of Corelli start with slow movements: BWV 1019, like the instrumental concertos of Bach, begins with a fast movement. Symmetrical in structure and written in strict da capo form, its opening 21 bar ritornello is scored as a tutti section for all three parts. The toccata-like semiquaver theme descending in the violin is matched by a rising quaver countersubject in the upper keyboard, with a rhythmic quasi-continuo in the bass line. The upper voices are written in invertible counterpoint in the ritornello, with the musical material alternating every two or four bars. The semiquavers continue unabated like a moto perpetuo throughout the ritornello, passing from one voice to another. After the first eight bars, when the main theme is heard twice, there is an eight-bar interlude when the violin and upper keyboard play in counterpoint, alternating between semiquaver motifs derived from the main theme and a syncopated countersubject. 700px For the remainder of the ritornello the semiquavers pass to the bass, with an arpeggiated version of the motifs for two bars which leads into a short coda and a cadence marking the beginning of the middle section of the movement. The arpeggios in the left hand of the harpischord are accompanied by an adaptation of the syncopated countersubject in the right hand and fragmented quaver responses in the violin. 800px The middle portion of the movement lasts 48 bars and is also symmetrical in structure, made up of two fugal sections and a central episode in which the non-thematic material in the ritornello is heard again. The new fugue subject is five bars long and is first heard in the violin with a simple figured bass accompaniment in quavers. The subject is then taken up in the upper keyboard, while the violin part plays figures drawn from the continuo line, including characteristic quaver leaps in sixths. A two bar bridging passages with semiquaver scales in parallel thirds in the upper parts leads into the statement of the fugue subject in the bass line, while the upper parts develop the accompanying motifs in syncopated exchanges. At the close semiquaver scales in the bass merge into the semiquaver arpeggios from the second interlude in the ritornello, which is reprised in full with the upper parts exchanged. It is followed by a reprise of the first interlude, which leads directly into a repetition of the entire fugal section with the upper parts exchanged. This time at the close the semiquaver scales in the bass line are joined by parallel scales in the upper parts for the final cadence that heralds the concluding rendition of the ritornello.See:  * *Largo The second movement of BWV 1019 is a Largo in E minor in triple time. A brief movement of only 21 bars in length, it has the tonal purpose of mediating between the keys of G major and E minor of the first and third movements. With the opening Allegro, it is one of the two movements present in every version of the sonata. The scoring, however, evolved as Bach added a third \\"middle\\" voice to the harpsichord part in later versions. This change results in the harpsichord part itself evolving within the piece as the middle voice enters: the texture of the accompaniment is gradually transformed from a simple continuo to a fully realised three-part accompaniment. 900px The Largo begins with a simple walking bass in the harpsichord which for the first three bars is annotated as a figured bass. The violin enters with the theme which is imitated in canon by the upper harpsichord part two bars later. The second complete statement of the theme is in the harpsichord with the canon in the violin, which passes into its \\"noble\\" lower register playing an expressive descending sequence of long sustained notes in suspension. It is during this passage that the third middle voice is first heard in the harpsichord playing semiquavers which dovetail with those of the main theme in the harpsichord, the combination of parts developing into a semiquaver accompaniment. 720px As this episode ends, the entire theme is heard once again but now in the bass line (in a slightly adapted form) with the violin in canon two bars later, resuming its descending sustained notes until the final cadence.See:   *Allegro (harpsichord solo) 900px In E minor and time, the third and central movement of BWV 1019 is an allegro in binary dance-form for solo harpsichord. Unlike the movements it replaced‚Äîthe corrente and tempo di gavotta from the sixth keyboard partita, BWV 830‚Äîit cannot be identified with a particular dance. Although perhaps less brilliant than the sixth partita, the compositional style is comparable to Bach's keyboard writing of the 1730s that can be found in the binary preludes in Book 2 of the Well Tempered Clavier or some movements from the Overture in the French Style, BWV 831: the final piece in BWV 831 was also an unspecified dance movement with a similar function of showcasing the harpsichord. BWV 1019/3 is composed as a large scale movement with two and sometimes three voices. The semiquavers in the rhythmic theme are developed in extended passagework in both the upper and lower keyboard; after a development section and a recapitulation of the theme an octave lower, the second part concludes with semiquavers in parallel and contrary motion in both hands.See:  Adagio 800px Part of a pictorial representation of the opening of BWV 1019/4 from the 1921‚Äì1922 Bauhaus lectures of the Swiss artist Paul KleeFor more details, please see The fourth movement is an Adagio in B minor in common time. Of 21 bars in length, its tonal function is to mediate between the keys of the central and final movements (E minor and G major). The contrapuntal material of themes and counter-themes is shared and exchanged between all three parts; the long phrases in the main theme provide a soaring melody for the violin. The first version of the sonata also had an Adagio in B minor with a similar function but, as Richard Jones comments, the later replacement is \\"more elaborate and of greater expressive weight and substance.\\" gives a detailed analysis of the musical structure of the Adagio, which alternates between two contrasting elements, the interplay between the two underlying the architecture of the movement. The first \\"arc-shaped\\" element is the fugue theme‚Äîflorid, melodic, rhythmically complex and based around the tonic key. It is heard in the first bar in the harpsichord over a rising scale of quavers in the bass. An inverted version of the opening motif appears in the bass line in the third bar as the two upper voices play descending figures semiquaver couplets, which not only complete the melodic line of the fugue theme in the violin part but also provide a counter-theme. The second \\"rectilinear\\" element‚Äîmore severe, chromatic and modulating‚Äîis first heard with its own counter-theme in the fifth bar. It is formed of a chain of motifs descending in crotchets, with syncopated rhythms related to those of the fugue theme. Time-wise the first element accounts for the majority of the movement, but the second element governs its tonal structure. Halfway through the movement in bar 11 the tonality reaches the relative major key of D major, but only fleetingly. The melody of the fugue subject and a variant of its completion return in the violin. After two bars of the chromatic syncopated material, the motifs of the fugue subject, broken up between all three voices, lead up to two cadences in F minor. The second element returns in the final two bar coda as the music modulates to the closing cadence in D major, in anticipation of the fifth movement in G major. See:  * *, preface * *Allegro 900px The fifth and final movement of BWV 1019 is a concertante, gigue-like Allegro in G major and time. Written for three voices in A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA da capo form, it is a hybrid movement, combining features from the tutti fugue and the concerto allegro. The energetic quaver theme in the fugal ritornello section is made up of repeated notes; the semiquaver counter-theme is also made up of repeated notes. Schweitzer and subsequent commentators have pointed out‚Äîwithout drawing any definite conclusions beyond the practise of self-borrowing‚Äîthat the subject, countersubject and other motifs in the ritornello have strong affinities with the aria for soprano and continuo Phoebus eilt mit schnellen Pferden (\\"Phoebus speeds with swifty steeds\\") from the secular Wedding Cantata Weichet nur, betr√ºbte Schatten, BWV 202 dating from Bach's period in Weimar. notes that probably in the original aria the quaver figures musically represented the trotting of horses and the semiquavers their swiftness. 800px Whatever its origins, the conception of the newly composed Allegro matches that of the five other fugal last movements as well as the symmetry of the opening Allegro. The opening ritornello section is 30 bars long. After the statement of the three- bar fugue subject in the violin, it is taken up in the upper harpsichord part with the semiquaver counter subject in the violin. It is then heard in the bass with the counter-theme in the upper harpsichord. At bar 14 the fugue develops with an inverted version of the opening motif in the violin in counterpoint with semiquaver figures in the left hand of the harpsichord with responses in the right hand. At the cadence marking the end of the ritornello (section A), the middle 58-bar \\"development\\" section B begins with a new highly ornamented one-bar theme in the harpsichord, consisting of declamatory repeated notes answered by a trill. It is echoed a bar later in the violin with the harpsichord playing in parallel thirds. 700px The new theme has the effect of an interjection ‚Äîa kind of caesura‚Äîtemporarily halting the flow of semiquavers, which resumes immediately afterwards with cascading scales over the fugue subject in the bass line. After a reprise with the parts inverted between violin and harpsichord, the middle section continues with joyful dance-like material drawn from the ritornello in half-bar exchanges between the violin and upper harpsichord before a cadence in E minor. The eight bar opening segment of section B is then reprised with the parts inverted followed by another episode of one-bar exchanges of motifs from the ritornello between all three parts until the music comes to a halt with a cadence in B minor. It resumes as a fugue on the counter-subject of the ritornello but the flow of the counter-theme is interrupted four times by half-bar interjections of the B theme. 850px As Watchorn remarks, these momentary interruptions are similar in effect to those in the last movement of the fourth Brandenburg Concerto BWV 1049. After further contrapuntal exchanges between all three parts the music draws to a second halt with a cadence in B minor. It then resumes with a complete recapitulation of the ritornello back in G major.See:   *Commentary by Peter Watchorn, page 16, Musica Omnia Reception and legacy =German-speaking countries= In the period 1700‚Äì1750, the trio sonata form became a sine qua non in the musical world. It incorporated all the ideals of harmony, melody and counterpoint espoused by theorists such as Mattheson, Scheibe and Quantz. In his treatise Der Vollkommene Capellmeister of 1739, Mattheson wrote that, ... es m√ºssen hier alle drey Stimmen, jede f√ºr sich, eine feine Melodie f√ºhren; und doch dabey, soviel m√∂glich, den Dreyklang behaupten, als obes nur zuf√§lliger Weise geschehe: \\"Here each of the three voices must separately provide a fine melodic line; yet all the while together they must sustain as much as possible the three part harmony, as if by serendipity.\\" Amongst all composers of that era, Bach was the one who raised the trio sonata form to its highest degree of perfection. In 1774 Bach's son Carl Philip Emmanuel commented that even after fifty years his father's compositions of this kind still sounded very good and that the lyricism of several of his adagios had never been surpassed. This continued veneration for these particular works even long after his death probably sprang not only from the fact that the form matched Bach's own compositional ideals‚Äîthat all voices should \\"work wondrously with each other\\" (wundersam durcheinander arbeiten)‚Äîbut also from the succeeding generation's preference for \\"sensitive\\" melodies. Perhaps even more influential was Bach's elevation of the harpsichord from a continuo instrument to a prominent obbligato instrument, on equal terms with the solo instrument, whilst also providing the bass line. As comments, with his sonatas for violin and obbligato keyboard \\"Bach triggered off the gradual demise of the sonata for violin and continuo,\\" even though it lived on in a few eighteenth century volin sonatas, for example those of Bach's German contemporaries Johann Adam Birkenstock, Johann David Heinichen, Gottfried Kirchhoff and Johann Georg Pisendel. Princess Anna Amalie Johann Kirnberger In the second half of the eighteenth century in Germany, the sonatas were transmitted through hand copies made by Bach's pupils and circle from Leipzig. During that period Berlin rose to prominence as the centre of musical activities in Germany. The court of Frederick the Great, where Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was appointed harpsichordist in 1740, had a number of exceptional violinists, including Johann Gottlieb Graun, the violin teacher of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, and Franz Benda, another of Graun's pupils. In Berlin Princess Anna Amalia, the sister of Frederick the Great, was a keen amateur keyboard player and from 1758 had Bach's pupil Johann Kirnberger as her music teacher: since 1751 he had been employed as another of Frederick's court violinists. Anna Amalia's music library‚Äîthe Amalienbibliothek, now incorporated in the Berlin State Library‚Äîcontained a large collection of Bach manuscripts, including a hand copy of the sonatas. Many musical compositions from her collection were transmitted to Vienna by Baron van Swieten, the Austrian ambassador to Berlin: starting in the 1770s, van Swieten ran his only weekly salon in Vienna devoted to the music of Bach. Bach's music was also performed in Berlin outside the royal court. The family of Daniel Itzig, banker to Frederick the Great and his father, provided a cultural milieu for musical connoisseurs: four of his daughters, Sara, Zippora, Fanny and Bella (maternal grandmother of Felix Mendelssohn), were all keyboard players.See:  * Title page of first printed edition of the sonatas published by the Swiss musicologist Hans Georg N√§geli in Zurich in the early 1800s. Portrait of Sara Levy by Anton Graff, 1786 Sara was the most gifted harpsichordist in the Itzig family, of professional standard. When Wilhelm Friedemann Bach moved to Berlin from Dresden, she took lessons from him and provided him with some financial support in his old age. Through Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel, she acquired a collection of hand copies of Bach manuscripts, including copies of the first and third sonatas (BWV 1014 and BWV 1016). After her marriage to the banker Samuel Salomon Levy in 1784, she ran a weekly musical salon in their residence on the Museuminsel. Sara herself performed in public, including performances at the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, from its foundation in 1791 until her retirement in 1810. The collections of Bachiana of Sara Levy and C.P.E. Bach became part of the Sing-Akademie's library, now held in the Berlin State Library.See:  The first printed score only appeared in the early nineteenth century. It was published in the early 1800s in Zurich by the Swiss musicologist Hans Georg N√§geli. The son of a musically inclined Protestant pastor in Wetzikon, N√§geli showed precocious musical skills. In 1790 he moved to Zurich where he took lessons with the Swiss pianist Johann David Br√ºnings, who introduced him to the music of Bach. A year later he set up a music shop and in 1794 a publishing house. Corresponding with Bach's publisher Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf and the widow of C.P.E. Bach, he was able to acquire Bach manuscripts, including that of the Mass in B minor, which he eventually published. His Bach publications started with the Well Tempered Clavier in 1801 and the Art of the Fugue in 1802. His interests later turned to pedagogy and singing: in Zurich he set up an institute similar to the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin of Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch.See:  1841 Peters edition Karol Lipi≈Ñski In the early nineteenth century the virtuosity of the violinist Niccol√≤ Paganini heralded a new generation of violinists. The Polish violinist Karol Lipi≈Ñski, trained with Paganini and toured all the main cities in Europe before eventually settling in Dresden. In 1841, as part of a complete edition of Bach's works by the Leipzig publisher C.F. Peters, he prepared a new performing edition of BWV 1014‚Äì1019 in collaboration with the pianist Carl Czerny. It had the title Six grandes sonates pour piano et violon oblig√©. For the edition, Moritz Hauptmann corrected errors in N√§geli's version by going back to original manuscripts; and Lipinski decided upon bowing and other performing details by playing through the sonatas with the organist August Alexander Klengel. Gottfried Wilhelm Fink, the editor of the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung, commented that \\"die Angabe der Bezeichnungen von einem Manne kommt, der nicht blos volkommener Meister seines Instrumentes, sondern auch vom Geiste Bach‚Äôscher Grossartigkeit durchdrungen ist\\" (\\"the provision of annotations comes from a man who is not merely a perfect master of his instrument, but also suffused with the sublimity of Bach‚Äôs spirit\\"). Felix Mendelssohn Ferdinand David The Berlin violinist, Ferdinand David, was concertmaster at the Gewandhaus, while Felix Mendelssohn was director; their association dated back to their infancy, as they were born within a year of each other in the same house. A champion of Bach's music and, with Robert Schumann, one of the main musicians leading the Bach revival in Germany, Mendelssohn would often include Bach's lesser known works in the programmes of the evening chamber music concerts at the Gewandhaus: in 1838 David and Mendelssohn performed the third sonata in E major BWV 1016; and in 1840 David played the Chaconne in D minor and Praeludium in E major from Bach's sonatas and partitas for solo violin with piano accompaniments provided by Mendelssohn; he felt that a piano accompaniment was needed to make the solo violin works more accessible to a nineteenth century audience. The Chaconne was programmed in several subsequent Gewandhaus seasons; David was unwilling to perform it unaccompanied in public but the young Joseph Joachim did so while briefly sharing the first desk with David. In Leipzig the firm of Friedrich Kistner published David's performing version of the solo sonatas and partitas in 1843. Later Mendelssohn had the arrangement of the Chaconne published in England in 1847; piano accompaniments were subsequently provided for all Bach's solo violin works by Schumann. In 1864 David prepared an edition of BWV 1014‚Äì1016 for Peters which was reissued ten years later by Breitkopf & H√§rtel.See: =England= Johann Peter Salomon, portrait by Thomas Hardy, 1792, Royal College of Music Samuel Wesley Charles Burney, portrait by Joshua Reynolds, 1781 Hanover Square Rooms, set up by Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel in 1774, was one of the main concert venues in London for over a century The sonatas BWV 1014‚Äì1019 figured prominently in the \\"English Bach awakening\\" that took place at the beginning of the 19th century, largely due to the efforts of Samuel Wesley. In 1809, while arranging the future publication with Charles Frederick Horn of the Well Tempered Clavier (sold by subscription in four instalments), Wesley began to stage performances of Bach's works in London with the help of Horn, Vincent Novello and Benjamin Jacobs, organist at the Surrey Chapel, Southwark. The public concerts included keyboard works‚Äîwith some of Bach's organ works arranged for piano three hands‚Äîand often one of the sonatas for violin and harpsichord, with the German violinist Johann Peter Salomon as soloist and Wesley at the keyboard. Wesley's personal copy, N√§geli's Zurich imprint, was purchased from Escher's music shop in London and is preserved in the Wesley archive of the Royal College of Music. For the first concerts, when Salomon was unavailable, Wesley played the violin part himself, although somewhat out of practice. Prior to the first public concert with organ accompaniment in the Surrey Chapel in November 1809, Wesley and Jacobs had also given a private performance of all six sonatas to Charles Burney, a venerable Handelian, recently converted to Bachism by Wesley. Salomon was already familiar with Bach's compositions for violin through Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel whom he knew from his period in Berlin, where he had served from 1764 to 1780 as director of music to Prince Heinrich of Prussia, the younger brother of Frederick the Great. In 1774 Johann Friedrich Reichardt had reported on Salomon's performances of the \\"magnificent violin solos by Bach without accompaniment\\" in Berlin, praising \\"the great power and sureness with which Salomon presented these masterpieces.\\" In London thirty years later, at Wesley's 1810 benefit concert in the Hanover Square Rooms, Salomon again performed one of the unaccompanied sonatas together with one of the sonatas for violin and harpsichord, with Wesley at the keyboard. More of the sonatas BWV 1014‚Äì1019 were included in subsequent concerts featuring Salomon: two were played for the first time in 1812 in a Surrey Chapel recital with Jacob at the organ.See Unverricht, Hubert, New Grove Dictionary =France= Woodcut of the pianist Marie Bigot Pierre Baillot, violinist At the turn of the nineteenth century, the chamber music of Bach became known in Paris thanks to the intermediary Marie Bigot. Born in Colmar in 1786, she was a highly accomplished keyboard player. In 1804, she moved to Vienna, where her performances attracted the admiration of Haydn, Salieri and Beethoven; her husband served as librarian to Beethoven's patron Count Razumovsky. In Vienna she became familiar with the keyboard and chamber music of Bach through the musical circles of Baron van Swieten, who had died a year before her arrival. Obliged to return to France in 1809 because of the Napoleonic wars, during the period 1809‚Äì1813 she proceeded to mount concerts in Paris with the violinist Pierre Baillot and the cellist Jacques-Michel Hurel de Lamare. After 1813, as a result of political events, she restricted herself to teaching, taking Felix Mendelssohn and his sister Fanny as pupils in 1816‚Äì1817. Bach's sonatas for violin and keyboard featured in the repertoire of the Paris concerts and prompted the musicologist Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis to comment that, \\"Anybody who has not heard Bach's beautiful compositions played by Mme Bigot, Lamare and Baillot will not know how far the perfection of instrumental music can go.\\" Qui n'a entendu les belles compositions de Bach ex√©cut√©es par Mme Bigot, Lamare et Baillot ne sait jusqu'o√π peut aller la perfection de la musique instrumentale Later around 1820 F√©tis himself attempted unsuccessfully to advance the musique d'autre-fois of Bach: his invitation for subscriptions to a proposed publication of organ works by Bach elicited only three responses. J√©r√¥me-Joseph de Momigny Another musicologist who had attended many of the recitals of Bigot was the musicologist J√©r√¥me-Joseph de Momigny. Of their performance of BWV 1014 in 1810 he wrote: Ce morceau pourrait etre froid, monotone et d'un go√ªt surann√©, s'il √©tait mal ex√©cut√© ; mais senti et rendu comme pourraient le sentir et le rendre Mme Bigot et M. Baillot, il ne laissera rien √† d√©sirer, et n'aura d'antique que quelques terminaisons qu'on sera bien aise d'y trouver, comme √©tant le cachet de l'√©poque o√π ce morceau a vu le jour, et surtout sous l'archet de M. Baillot, qui sait les rafraichir d'une mani√®re d√©licieuse, et avec un sentiment qui tient de la d√©votion.\\" The writings of Momigny can be considered as marking the reawakening of an interest in Bach in France. Already in 1803, barely a year after the publication of Forkel's biography of Bach, he had started his study of polyphony with the fugues and sonatas of Bach. One of Momigny's main contributions was an article in the music section of the Encyclop√©die m√©thodique ou par ordre de mati√®re (1818) analysing the sonatas BWV 1014 and BWV 1015/1. The article discusses the development of the sonata in the eighteenth century, divided into halves, with the sonatas of Bach, in N√§geli's edition, taken as representatives for 1700‚Äì1750 and the piano sonatas of Haydn for 1750‚Äì1800. Although Momigny enthusiastically wrote of Bach, c'est dans les trente ou quarante premi√®res ann√©es du si√®cle dernier, qu'il offrit au public les fruits pleins de maturit√© de son g√©nie transcendant,‚Äî\\"it was in the first thirty or forty years of the last century that he gave the public the fully matured fruits of his transcendent genius\\"‚Äîthe general revival of interest in the music of Bach, particularly his choral works, was slower in France than in Germany. While referring to the timelessness and influence of Bach's music, Momigny lamented that the sonatas were so rarely performed; he wrote that the time was not ripe because of changes in musical taste, but also observed that \\"there are very few people capable of playing them and understanding them\\". At the beginning of the twentieth century there was an increased interest in classical chamber music in France. The onset of the First World War and resulting issues of nationalism prompted French music publishers to bring out their own editions of classic German works to replace German editions. Claude Debussy was the editor for Durand's version of BWV 1014‚Äì1019.See: Arrangements and transcriptions *Arrangement of the six sonatas for viola and piano, Friedrich Hermann (1828‚Äì1907), Library of Viola Music, Breitkopf & H√§rtel. *Arrangements by the German violinist August Wilhelmj: **Adagio, BWV 1016/i, for violin and organ, 1885, Berlin: Schlesinger. **Siciliano, BWV 1017/i, for violin and orchestra, 1885, Berlin: Schlesinger. *Arrangements for piano: **Allegro, BWV 1014/i, two pianos, Michael Gottlieb. **Andante, BWV 1015/iii, piano solo, Ludwig Stark (1831‚Äì1884). **Adagio, BWV 1016/i, piano solo, Bernhard Kistler-Liebend√∂rfer. **Siciliano, BWV 1017/i, piano solo: Heinrich Bungart (1864‚Äì1910); Eric Kuhlstrom (1860‚Äì1940); and Ludwig Stark. **Adagio, BWV 1017/iii, piano solo, Bernhard Kistler-Liebend√∂rfer. **Adagio, BWV 1018/iii, piano solo; Bernhard Kistler-Liebend√∂rfer; and Alexander Siloti (1863‚Äì1945). **Allegro, BWV 1019/i, piano solo, Erich Doflein (1900‚Äì1977). *Arrangement of Siciliano, BWV 1017/i, for violin and harp, Franz Poenitz (1850‚Äì1912), Berlin: Carl Simon Musikverlag. *Arrangement of Adagio, BWV 1017/iii, for organ, Franz Liszt, 1866.

She was the younger sister of birth control activist Margaret Sanger, and assisted her in this work. Background Ethel and Margaret were two out of eleven children of an Irish American family founded by Michael Hennessey Higgins and Anne Higgins. It has been noted that Anne Higgins gave preferential treatment to Ethel, much to the dismay of Margaret, and that caused a rift in their relationship. Ethel had a short and unhappy marriage to Jack Byrne, a glassworker. They had two children, Jack and Olive. In 1906, Ethel left her children in the care of their paternal grandparents to protect them from their abusive father; Ethel only visited her daughter once in sixteen years. Olive grew up to become an important muse to the creator of Wonder Woman, William Moulton Marston, and more details of Ethel Byrne's life came to light when Jill Lepore wrote about the superheroine character in 2014. Ethel Byrne's background in nursing was pivotal to her activism and directly contributed to her desire to make birth control accessible to women of varying socio-economic backgrounds. She was a trained nurse who assisted immigrant women in need of medical care in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn, New York in 1916. Birth control activism Margaret Sanger and her sister Ethel Byrne leaving a courthouse The two sisters and theatre artist Fania Mindell opened a birth control clinic in Brooklyn in October 1916. The three feminist activists advertised the services offered by the clinic by passing out flyers in different languages, including English, Yiddish and Italian.http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/people/sanger- margaret/ Although Byrne is not widely known today, her early activism had long lasting impact on raising awareness of the importance of access to information about birth control. The arrest of Ethel Byrne compelled a group of politically active New York women to ask for a meeting with President Woodrow Wilson to request that he contribute to overturning laws criminalizing distribution of birth control.MRS. BYRNE WEAKER, STILL FASTS IN CELL New York Times (1857-1922); Jan 26, 1917; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times pg. 1 Arrest and hunger strike The clinic was highly controversial due to the enforcement of the Comstock Laws. Byrne and Sanger distributed pessaries and would show their clients how to use this method of contraception in direct violation of these laws. This was the first birth control clinic in the United States. The clinic caused an immediate sensation in the press, getting national attention, and all three women were arrested and tried for \\"distributing obscene materials\\". :\\"The police monitored the Clinic from its opening and sent in a female undercover agent to purchase contraceptive supplies. On October 26 (1916) an undercover police woman and vice-squad officers raided the clinic, confiscated an assortment of contraceptives from pessaries to condoms, along with 20 'books on young women', and arrested Sanger, Byrne and Mindell. After being arraigned, Sanger and Mindell spent the night in the Raymond Street jail, Byrne at the Liberty Avenue station. All were released the next morning on $500.00 bail.\\" Margaret Sanger Papers Project, NYU. All three women were found guilty, but eventually the verdicts were overturned, and their campaign was ultimately successful, leading to major changes in social policy and to the laws governing birth control and sex education around the world.‚ÄúMrs Sanger Gets 30 Days.‚Äù Washington Post, February 7, 1917.\\"Mrs. Sanger's Aide Is Found Guilty\\". New York Times, January 9, 1917. The clinic closed but later became the basis for what was to become known as Planned Parenthood. After being arrested for distribution of information about birth control, Byrne was sentenced to 30 days in Blackwell's Island prison. She was jailed at Blackwell Island workhouse on January 22, 1917 for her activism in advocating for the legalization of birth control and subsequently went on a hunger strike. Sanger was concerned her sister would lose her life as a result of this hunger strike and Byrne was force fed while serving her sentence after 185 hours without food or water. As historian Jill Lepore reports in The Secret History of Wonder Woman, Ethel Byrne was the first female political prisoner in the United States to be subjected to force feeding. Mrs. Byrne was prepared to starve herself to death in support of her cause.\\"MRS. BYRNE NOW FED BY FORCE.\\"\\". New York Times (1857-1922):. ProQuest. Jan 28 1917 Her case was the first of a group of cases known as the \\"Sanger cases\\" to be brought to trial.\\"MRS. SANGER'S AID IS FOUND GUILTY.\\" 1917.New York Times (1857-1922), Jan 09, 11. http://search.proquest.com/docview/98070877 Sanger supported Byrne's activism and was quoted as saying \\"I didn't advise her to undertake this hunger strike, but I certainly would not tell her to end it now.\\" Although they had a falling out after this arrest, their confinement helped bring national attention to their push for the legalization of birth control. It also hurt their relationship as Sanger's notoriety grew after this arrest and she was sometimes known to take credit for Ethel's infamous hunger strike. Later years Although her sister went on to become world-famous for her advocacy of birth control, Byrne's legacy is not well known. This is apparent on the Planned Parenthood website, as it is noted Sanger opened her 1916 clinic with \\"her sister\\". Ethel is not even mentioned by name and unlike her older sister is not a household name. Ethel Byrne had a stroke and died in 1955. She did not live to see the legalization of the birth control pill, as she died five years before it received FDA approval.

Epistasis Is a Major Determinant of the Additive Genetic Variance in Mimulus guttatus. PLoS Genetics. 11, 5, 1-21, May 2015. Additive genetic variance involves the inheritance of a particular allele from your parent and this allele's independent effect on the specific phenotype, which will cause the phenotype deviation from the mean phenotype. Dominance genetic variance refers to the phenotype deviation caused by the interactions between alternative alleles that control one trait at one specific locus. Epistatic variance involves an interaction between different alleles in different loci.Byers, D. (2008) Components of phenotypic variance. Nature Education 1(1):161  Genetic variance and heritability  Heritability refers to how much of the phenotypic variance is due to variance in genetic factors. Usually after we know the total amount of genetic variance that is responsible for a trait, we can calculate the trait heritability. Heritability can be used as an important predictor to evaluate if a population can respond to artificial or natural selection.Byers, D. (2008) Components of phenotypic variance. Nature Education 1(1) Broad-sense heritability, H2 = VG/VP, Involves the proportion of phenotypic variation due to the effects of additive, dominance, and epistatic variance. Narrow-sense heritability, h2 = VA/VP, refers to the proportion of phenotypic variation that is due to additive genetic values (VA).Hill, W. G., et al. Data and theory point to mainly additive genetic variance for complex traits.

Genetic variance‚Äìcovariance (G ) matrices conveniently summarize the genetic relationships among a suite of traits and are a central parameter in the determination of the multivariate response to selection.  Research examples  1.The distribution of genetic variance across phenotypic space and the response to selection.BLOWS, MW; MCGUIGAN, K. The distribution of genetic variance across phenotypic space and the response to selection. Molecular Ecology. 9, 2056, 2015. Understand how empirical spectral distribution of G predicts the response to selection across phenotypic space. In particular, trait combinations that form a nearly null genetic subspace with little genetic variance respond only inconsistently to selection. They set out a framework for understanding how the empirical spectral distribution of G may differ from the random expectations that have been developed under random matrix theory (RMT). Using a data set containing a large number of gene expression traits. 2.Comparing estimates of genetic variance across different relationship models. In this research, the researchers use the different relationship models to compare estimates of genetic variance components and the heritability. However, different models may give different estimates of genetic variances. They found that expected genetic variances usually equals the estimated variance times a statistic, Dk, and for the most typical models of relationships, Dk is close to 1, which means most of these models can be used to estimate the genetic variance. 3.Estimation of Additive, Dominance, and Imprinting Genetic Variance Using Genomic DataLopes, Marcos S., et al. \\"Estimation of Additive, Dominance, and Imprinting Genetic Variance Using Genomic Data.\\" G3: Genes Genomes Genetics5.12 (2015): 2629-2637. The development of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping helps to explore the genetic variation of complex traits at individual loci. Researchers can quantify the contribution of additive, dominance, and imprinting variance to the total genetic variance by using a SNP regression method.

Habitat  Maitai Cave This snail has only been found in one spot: in one pool, in a stream at the entrance of Maitai Cave, in the Maitai River Valley southeast of Nelson. It is one of a group of very small, blind, transparent freshwater snails found in caves or underground streams, especially in Northwest Nelson, and like many of these species has evolved in just one small area.  Taxonomy  The tiny (1.7 x 1.2 mm) snail was discovered by Frank Climo in the 1970s, but was considered to be just one form of another subterranean Hadopyrgus snail found in the Nelson area. In 2001 Martin Haase and Christina Mosimann collected more specimens from Maitai Cave by washing and sieving gravel, and using both morphological and genetic evidence realised these belonged to a distinct species. They scientifically described and named it Hadopyrgus ngataana in 2008; the name they chose, ngataana, comes from the MƒÅori words ngata (snail or slug) and ana (cave).  Conservation status  In November 2018 the Department of Conservation classified H. ngataana as Nationally Critical, using the New Zealand Threat Classification System. The species meets the Nationally Critical criteria because it is found in just one location, and occupies a total area of less than 1 hectare. Because Maitai Cave is a popular recreational area, and the stream the species has evolved in is so small, the population of this critically endangered snail is expected to decline. While it is possible for freshwater invertebrates to be legally protected under the Wildlife Amendment Act 1980, neither H. ngataana nor any other New Zealand freshwater invertebrate has been protected.

The short story was commissioned by George E. Wood for $100, and published in a miscellany titled The Parthenon. It was reprinted in Specimens of American Literature in New York in 1866. The short story satirizes political demagoguery, focused on William Henry Seward. The title of the story comes from a mysterious loud exploding sound coming from Seneca Lake, called \\"The Lake Gun\\" by European American settlers to the area, and known today as the Seneca Guns. These sounds remain unexplained to this day, with no clear or agreed-upon cause. Plot summary The story takes place on Seneca Lake in Central New York in the early nineteenth century. On Seneca Lake could be heard loud explosions which observers labeled \\"The Lake Gun.\\" The source is unknown but the Native Americans consider it the voice of the Manitou, their god. There is also the \\"Wandering Jew,\\" a tree trunk that floats on the lake blown by winds and currents. Fuller, a traveler to the Finger Lakes, after hearing accounts of the \\"lake gun\\" and the \\"Wandering Jew\\", hires a boat with which he explores the mysteries accompanied by Peter. Fuller notices an Iroquois of the Seneca tribe gazing at the lake one morning. He is college-educated. Wearing buckskin leggings and a blanket, he has returned to visit his ancestral home. He looks at the Swimming Seneca, the \\"Wandering Jew\\". They hear the \\"lake gun\\" sound. The Iroquois explains their origin. There was once a demagogue, a chief, See-wise, who did not follow the traditions of the Seneca as established by the Great Spirit, Manitou. He decided that fishing could be done whenever people wanted. This went against the dictates of Manitou. But he was able to get youthful supporters for his cause. He then disappeared without a trace. He was changed into a trunk of a tree floating in the lake according to the account. He would float for a thousand years. When he dived to fish, Manitou would warn him to stop, which was the \\"lake gun\\" explosion heard. The Iroquois explains the lasting impression made upon him by the legend: \\"I cannot say. The things learned in childhood remain the longest on the memory. They make the deepest marks. I have seen the evil that a demagogue can do among the pale-faces; why should I not believe the same among my own people!\\" When Peter sails close to the trunk, he points out its appearance, a shape that resembles a human face. It appears like a retreating forehead and a hatchet-shaped face. These are features that mimic William Henry Seward's appearance as noted by Robert E. Spiller. The story concludes with a warning against demagoguery: \\"The man or the people that trust in God will find a lake for every See-wise\\" 1932 republication The story was republished in 1932 as a limited edition stand- alone book by publisher William Farquhar Payson with an introduction by Robert E.

In May 1794 the French Navy captured her and took her into service as Alerte. A few months later the Royal Navy destroyed her. Career Commander Charles Smyth commissioned her in October 1793. He then sailed for Nova Scotia in May 1794. Alert was off the coast of Ireland when she had the misfortune to encounter the 40-gun French frigate Unit√©. At daybreak on 14 May Alert was at when she sighted three vessels. These edged towards Alert, as she edged away, and the strangers did not respond to Alerts signals. At about 10:45 another three vessels appeared. The strange vessels signaled to each other, and most sailed away, but one remained in chase. Then at noon some vessels appeared off Alerts bow and Smyth decided to engage his pursuer to try to cripple her and so escape. Alert and the frigate closed at about 1:45pm and an action commenced after Smyth declined an invitation to strike. By 3:30 Alert had lost three men killed and nine wounded, her rigging and sails were shredded, and she had taken shots between wind and water. At this point Smyth struck. The French took her into service as Alerte. Some four months later, on 23 August, , Captain John Borlase Warren, and , Captain Sir Edward Pellew, chased two French corvettes, Alerte and Espion into Audierne Bay. The two corvettes anchored off the Gamelle Rocks, but when they saw that the British intended to capture them, their captains got under weigh and ran their vessels aground below the guns of three shore batteries. The corvettes continued to exchange fire with the two British frigates until early evening, when the corvettes' masts fell. At that point many of the French crewmen abandoned their vessels and went ashore. Warren sent in the boats from both Flora and Arethusa, all under Pellew's command, with orders to set fire or otherwise destroy the two corvettes. Pellew went in and took possession of both, but determined that he could not extract the wounded. Pellew therefore left the vessels, which he determined were bilged and scuttled, with rocks having pierced their bottoms, and left with 52 prisoners. Pellew estimated that Alerte had suffered 20 to 30 men killed and wounded, and that Espion had lost more. French records indicate that Alerte, which had been under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Passart, had been scuttled and was lost. However, the French Navy was able to refloat Espion, which had been under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Magendie.Fonds Marine, p 74 & p.84.

Early in the war, he led the last American cavalry charge in military history. Early life Edwin Ramsey was born in Carlyle, Illinois. The family moved, first to El Dorado, Kansas, when he was two, and then to Wichita ten years later. His father committed suicide after being arrested on suspicion of battering his wife. Ramsey's mother was a dermatologist who later ran her own clinic. His older sister, Nadine, became one of the first female United States Mail pilots and ferried fighters and bombers in World War II. Ramsey graduated from Oklahoma Military Academy in Claremore, Oklahoma, in May 1938. He attended the University of Oklahoma, but left to enlist in the United States Army in 1941. World War II In February 1941, Second Lieutenant Ramsey was assigned to the 11th Cavalry Regiment at Campo, California. When volunteers were requested for the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts) in the Philippines, he jumped at the opportunity. Ramsey recalled later that \\"... I didn't even know where it was, except that it was a warm country, it was tropical and they had a good polo team there.\\" He had been on the Oklahoma Military Academy polo team and played on the losing side of a polo match in the Philippines the day before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor; the umpire was Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright (who would assume command of the South West Pacific Area after General Douglas MacArthur was evacuated to Australia). As a first lieutenant during the withdrawal to Corregidor in the Philippines Campaign, he was in command of the 27-man, mostly Filipino G Troop when they encountered the enemy in the village of Morong on the Bataan peninsula on January 16, 1942. Despite being heavily outnumbered by an infantry force supported by tanks, Ramsey ordered the last cavalry charge in American military history. The surprised Japanese broke and fled. Ramsey and his men held their position for five hours under heavy fire, until reinforcements could be brought up. He would later be awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart for this action. After the fall of Bataan, Ramsey and Captain Joseph Barker made their way to central Luzon and joined Lieutenant Colonel Claude Thorp, who had been given the task of organizing guerrilla resistance by MacArthur. Luzon was divided into four regions, and Barker was given responsibility for the East Central Luzon Guerrilla Area (ECLGA), extending from Manila to the Lingayen Gulf. After Thorp was captured by the Japanese in October 1942, Barker took his place, putting Ramsey in charge of the ECLGA. Barker himself was eventually caught and executed by the Japanese. The guerrilla force under Ramsey's command grew to nearly 40,000. They fought using captured and hand-made weapons (\\"We made arms out of sawed- off pipes that we used as shotguns.\\"), gathered intelligence and distributed propaganda. Allied forces landed in Luzon in early January 1945. On June 13, General MacArthur personally awarded Ramsey the Distinguished Service Cross for his guerrilla activities. Ramsey, already a major by 1943, was promoted to lieutenant colonel shortly before being ordered back to the United States. The ordeal in the Philippines had taken its toll ‚Äì he had lost half his weight and was down to only in January 1945 ‚Äì and he spent nearly a year recovering from malaria, dysentery, and acute malnutrition in the hospital. Lieutenant Colonel Ramsey received a medical discharge in 1946. Post-war Ramsey obtained a law degree at the University of Oklahoma. He was a vice president of Hughes Aircraft Corporation's Far East division in Japan. He later headed electronics and consulting firms in Taiwan and the Philippines. When he retired, he settled in California. He co-wrote his memoirs, Lieutenant Ramsey's War: From Horse Soldier to Guerrilla Commander, published in 1990. Personal life In 1948, he married Madeleine Willoquet, the daughter of the French ambassador in Manila. They had four children. They divorced in the 1970s. He then married Raquel Ramirez in 1979. Edwin Price Ramsey died of natural causes on March 7, 2013, and was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on June 28. He was survived by his second wife and his four children from his first marriage.

His father was the organist Ludvig Mathias Lindeman and he was married to the composer Anna Severine Lindeman (1859‚Äì1938). Lindeman studied under Erika Nissen in Oslo, as well as in Stockholm from 1878 to 1879 and under Friedrich Gr√ºtzmacher in Dresden from 1885 to 1886. He was the principal organist at Uranienborg Church from 1880 to 1907, and at Frogner Church from 1907 to 1930. He also played cello in the evenings at the Christiania Theatre from 1880 to 1883. Together with his father, he established the Christiania Organist School in 1883, with 12 students. In 1885 it had 174 students and was renamed the Music and Organist School. This was renamed again in 1892 to the Christiania Music Conservatory, which was the only institution of its kind in Norway until 1905.Norges musikkh√∏gskole: Musikkh√∏gskolens historie.

It was founded in 1979 by CEO and owner Nicholas Jenkins. The business would comprise the sub-companies: Demolition Technologies, The Machine Shop, Bluegrass Concrete Cutting Inc. and Bluegrassbit. Bluegrass Company have always been headquartered in Greenville, Alabama though now incorporated in Wyoming. The company would become known for the advancement of diamond wire sawing as a technique for non-explosive demolition, later for the creation and patenting of an underwater diamond wire saw, and for assisting the U.S. Department of Energy with various tests as well as nuclear decommissioning.  Nuclear  = Power Plant Decommissioning = Bluegrass has performed reactor vessel cutting and steam generator replacements at Sequoyah, Watts Bar, Browns Ferry, Waterford Nuclear Generating Station, Connecticut Yankee, Humboldt Bay, and Big Rock Point Nuclear power plants over the course of the last 30 years. = Plutonium Immobilization Project = The company has worked for the government of the United States of America: Department of energy on their Plutonium Immobilization Project, \\"After the low pour rate and instrumented canisters cooled, Bluegrass Bit, Inc. used a diamond wire saw to section them at four heights. The sections were then studied for evidence of hardware deformation and glass voids\\" . This project focused on the finding a way to disposition excess plutonium of a weapons grade classification. =Diamond Shaving of Contaminated Concrete Surfaces= The company helped to test using diamond shaving to decontaminate radioactive surfaces. = The Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) = In 1997 Bluegrass with the help of the Princeton Physics Laboratory offered a demonstration of how the TFTR could be disassembled with diamond wire sawing, ‚ÄúBased upon the demonstration at PPPL on the TFTR surrogate, the diamond wire cutting technology is superior to the baseline technology for both cost and safety considerations. The combination of void filling with this cutting technology will significantly reduce personnel radiation exposure through shielding, remote operation (normal application of this technology), and radionuclide stabilization‚Äù. = ITER= In 2018 Bluegrass supported General Atomics by cutting a ¬º scale mockup of the ITER solenoid constructed by wrapping 288 individual stainless steel bars with copper conductor and coiling the resulting ‚Äúsuperconductor‚Äù into a ring 3 ft tall x 2 ¬Ω ft wide. The heart of the ITER tokamak, a solenoid is used to magnetically confine a plasma of reactive charged particles into a hollow doughnut-shaped container. The ring of stainless steel and copper was segmented into 4 pieces sized for shipment to another facility for analysis. =NS Savannah= Retired NS (Nuclear Ship) Savannah, anchored at Baltimore, MD, underwent a renovation in 2018 which required cutting into the nuclear containment vessel to gain access to the reactor. Bluegrass engineered and fabricated bespoke equipment for the confined space to cut, lift and move the 2 ton containment wall cut blocks. The removal of the cut segments had to all be done in a very confined space mostly by manual labor and an elaborate pulley system designed specifically for this job alone.  Civil  =Transportation: Highways, Railroads, Ports, Bridges= Railway bridge projects include a Union Pacific Railroad over the Willamette River in Oregon, and a BNSF pivot bridge over Bayou des Allemandes. Highway bridge projects include the Dumbarton Bridge in California and Wisner Boulevard bridge in New Orleans, LA. At the Port of Los Angeles, CA, an underwater wire saw cut Berth 29 for removal. On the demolition of the East Span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in Spring 2017, Bluegrass cut and segmented the above-water blocks of Piers E6, E7, E8, and E10 through E16, then core drilled for rigging and removal all the cut blocks except those on E6. The pier demolition project was authorized by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission in part to mitigate for all the fill associated with construction of the new East Span of the Bay Bridge. =Hydroelectric= Bluegrass Slot Cut at Hiwassee Dam Projects such as Hiwassee Dam and Fontana Dam have been a focus of the company as well, also see their work with Tennessee Valley Authority. With regard to dam remediation and upgrades, slot cutting projects are the company's main focus. It is akin to slicing a concrete dam like a piece of birthday cake. The technique is simple but very difficult, rotate a loop of cable strung with diamond embedded beads through the structure ‚Äî essentially, like using a loop of fishing line to cut a cake. Slot cutting is employed to create expansion joints in dams afflicted with compression stresses due to concrete swelling. Alkali Aggregate Reaction, or AAR, is a chemical reaction in concrete created where the aggregate has a high silicon dioxide content. The southeast USA is one such region, and dams in that area require periodic slot cuts to avoid cracking, leakage, and interference with mechanical components such as gates and turbines. The time intervals depend on the AAR specifics of each structure, but 10 years is an average. Bluegrass participated in the Saluda Dam Remediation project in South Carolina, a requirement by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which involved seismic upgrades to the dam and building a backup dam immediately downstream. Bluegrass was contracted to assist with removal of concrete piers and retaining wall to provide access to the penstock towers which supply water to the turbines in the hydroelectric plant. Bluegrass diamond wire saws were ideally suited to the job because of the minimal vibration emitted, therefore avoided the potential hazard of vibrating debris into the draft tubes. Expansive grout and robotic hammers were also used to break the concrete blocks for removal. =NASA= Cell B&C; are demolished to make room for new SLS tooling. As part of planning the Orion programme for the journey beyond low Earth orbit to destinations such as Mars, NASA needed to demolish the existing concrete silos (built to assemble the Space Shuttle booster rockets) at their Michoud Assembly Facility. This was necessary in order to replace the silos with larger Space Launch System (SLS) core stage assembly towers. The task of removing the existing concrete silos was estimated to take three months. Bluegrass was called in to regain schedule for the overall project, eventually completing the demolition of cells B and C in a month.  Offshore  In 2006 Bluegrass created an underwater saw and had it patented for its use of hydraulic motors in combination with diamond wire to create a new sawing platform which was operational underwater. The continuous loop, four wheel drive diamond wire saw reduced cut times by providing greater torque and consistent wire grip. These improvements reduced slippage and subsequent wire breaks. Since then the patented underwater saw has been used domestically and globally on offshore decommissioning jobs including cutting single- and multi-string conductors, pipelines, seabed umbilicals, pilings, mooring chains, wellheads, risers, slot recovery and jacket lets. On platforms this technology can be applied to perform modifications, maintenance upgrades, to remove crane pedestals, compressors and topsides, and for hurricane remediation. Sub-sea saws can be installed by divers while being monitored and powered from a barge or platform, or they can be installed and powered by working class ROVs. The robust characteristics of these four wheel drive bespoke underwater wire saws, combined with remote control functionality, makes them suitable to extreme offshore decommissioning conditions such as the North Sea. = U.S. Patent #8,286,625 = Bluegrass Underwater Saw The patent was filed with the advantages being summarized as follows: # An advantage of the present invention is a diamond wire saw assembly that provides the ability to cut large diameter heavy walled multi- string pipes remotely, safely and quickly. # Another advantage is a diamond wire saw assembly that eliminates labor-intensive methods requiring the use of divers at extreme depths. # Another advantage is that the diamond wire saw assembly can be deployed by remotely operated vehicles. # Another advantage is that the diamond wire saw assembly can be used for removal of damaged offshore oil platforms as well as for decommissioning of oil platforms that have reached their useful life and are being removed. # Another advantage is a diamond wire saw assembly that is portable. # Another advantage is a diamond wire saw that eliminates wire breakage. = Hurricane Remediation = Bluegrass was involved in the arduous post-Katrina and -Rita cleanup of toppled or damaged offshore production platforms. Operating from work vessels chartered by Chevron, the cleanup team moved from platform to platform in the Gulf of Mexico, cutting structural platform members, stringers and caissons underwater and on deck to comply with BOEM and BSEE federal requirements to remove O & G (Oil and Gas) production debris from the seafloor. Industrial Examples of application to heavy industry include foundation removals and modifications, chest removals in the pulp and paper industry, brick and refractory removal primarily using robotic hammers, and boiler segmentation. In many industrial plants such as cememt, lime, copper, aluminum, and chemical, the kiln's refractory lining wears out and needs to be replaced, or is compromised by lime buildup which must be removed. For these demolition jobs, remotely operated robotic hammers are used to break up the refractory for removal, and for chipping off lime deposits. =Paper Mills= The production of wood pulp and paper products requires extensive concrete structures including foundations, walls, raised platforms and kilns. Refractory in kilns needs to be replaced periodically. A variety of maintenance, upgrade, retrofit, and replacement projects in this industry calls into service the full array of demolition equipment: core drills and diamond wire saws for cutting concrete bases, walls and foundations, and for releasing and cutting tanks and chests. Robotic hammers are able to work in the limited space of kilns to effectively break refractory and lime buildup for removal. =Chemical Plants and Refineries= The structures, mechanisms and environments of chemical plants and refineries are ideal candidates for the spark-free and vibration-free concrete and metal cutting technologies used by Bluegrass. Heavy Metal Los Alamost National Laboratories (LANL) Technical Area 54 contracted Bluegrass for assistance with a stockpile cleanup project. The inventory of 84\\" diameter exotic steel spheres needed to be segmented into sizes suitable for containment and disposal. Bluegrass designed a saw to these specifications: it had to make a continuous cut, without stopping, through steel nearly 3\\" thick, and to avoid creating contaminated slurry it could not be cooled with water, typically wire saws are cooled by water, thus the wire burned out quicker.

The Christian villagers that bought the property, returned it to Alexios Alexis whenever he appeared in their villages. For years, Alexios Alexis moved from Marmaketo to Houmeriako, Psychro, Mirabello, Viannos, Malia, Megalo Kastro-Heraklion, and elsewhere. On these trips he wore simple clothes to avoid attention. He had only one fellow-traveler who rode on a donkey, while Alexios walked ahead of him, incognito. This role-playing was meant to avoid the Turks‚Äô attention and to pass unnoticed.Dalapsi C., History, Vikelaia Library, Heraklion, Crete Struggle against Ottoman rule His walking journeys and mountain hikes had another purpose. With other prominent Cretans he planned Crete's revolutionary uprising against the Ottoman tyranny. Leadership The name Alexis was considered a Byzantine name which was deemed to be a link between Hellenism and Byzantine culture; his father had, in Lassithi and elsewhere, estates such as orchards and hereditary fiefs from the Byzantine period (961-1204), most of which were given to the Prefectures. He donated a Byzantine feudal estate in Viannos to host a resort in Crete. Byzantine nobleman Alexis Kallergis and his family (formerly the Phokas family) used Lassithi as a base during the Cretan revolutions of 1283 and 1364.Megali encyclopedia-History of Lassithi Prefecture, Jermiado - Œ§Œ∂ŒµœÅŒºŒπŒ¨Œ¥œâŒΩ, Œ§el. 28440 89040 According to tradition, the Alexis family had an affinity with the Cretan Callergi or (Kallergi) family, which had many members named Alexis and, like other freedom fighters of Crete, were patriots people involved with issues and beliefs that benefited their homeland. Alexis donated properties to the Monastery of Agias Pelagias and the Crystallenias or (Croustallenias) Monastery. Personal life In 1715, Alexios married his first wife, who was from Kritsa. She bore him three sons and three daughters. She died in 1735. In 1737, he remarried, to Chryssie. They had no children. In 1760, at sixty-eight years of age, he married for the third time. His much younger wife was Annezina from Simi and gave birth to a child named Nicholas.

It grew tremendously throughout the late 1800s and into the first quarter of the 1900s with an approach called \\"The Larkin Idea\\" that transformed the company into a mail-order conglomerate that employed 2,000 people and had annual sales of $28.6 million () in 1920. The company's success allowed them to hire Frank Lloyd Wright to design the iconic Larkin Administration Building which stood as a symbol of Larkin prosperity until the company's demise in the 1940s. History 150x150pxBoraxine advertisement from 1882The Larkin Company was founded in 1875 as \\"J. D. Larkin, Manufacturer of Plain and Fancy Soaps\\" when John D. Larkin sold his interest in his brother-in-law's company J. Weller & Co. in Chicago to set up his own factory in Buffalo, New York. His first product was a yellow laundry bar named \\"Sweet Home Soap.\\" Larkin's first salesman was his wife's brother, Elbert Hubbard, who had also been working for J. Weller & Co. in Chicago as a salesman. The business grew very quickly, and in 1877 Larkin bought land on Seneca Street in Buffalo and built his first factory. By 1878, the company was producing 9 different soap products, ranging from \\"Boraxine\\" soap powder, through a variety of laundry soaps to \\"Jet\\" harness soap, \\"Oatmeal\\" toilet soap and Glycerine. In 1878, 13-year-old Darwin D. Martin was hired as a salesman in Boston. By 1880, as sales to general stores and other merchants who would buy products in large quantities increased, Martin relocated to Buffalo and became the first, and at that time the only, hired office-worker of the Larkin Company, as all office work was done by Larkin himself. \\"The Larkin Idea\\" In 1881, the company initiated door-to-door sales to private residences to complement its mail solicitation to storekeepers. To establish brand identity and keep up with competitors, Hubbard inserted a modest premium into every box of soap starting with a color picture of the company's logo. This coincided with the growth of the company's mail-order business and the strategy of gift premiums escalated quickly into larger and more interesting souvenir picture cards than his competitors. From there, Larkin and Hubbard began experimenting and refining the practice. Soon a handkerchief was included with the \\"Pure White\\" toilet soap and then a bath towel with the purchase of \\"Ocean Bath\\" soap. Larkin and Hubbard decided to market directly to consumers, and by 1885 had eliminated all middlemen, including their own salesmen. With the money saved on sales commissions, Larkin was able to offer better premiums. In 1891, Larkin placed its first large wholesale order, $40,000 () worth of piano lamps. The next year it expanded into Morris Chairs worth $80,000 () and oak dining chairs worth $125,000 (). One of the most popular giveaways was the Chatauqua Desk. For a $10 order of soap, the customer would receive the soap and the desk, a $10 premium. The idea grabbed the attention of the public, and through further refinement, Larkin began offering a variety of both products and premiums. The \\"Combination Box\\", advertised in the 1890s, offered enough soap and toiletry products to last an average family one year. In 1893, the catalog was sent to 1.5 million customers. To meet customer demand as the business grew, Larkin found it necessary to manufacture its own goods for the most popular premiums. Various subsidiaries were developed including a furniture factory in Buffalo to assemble pieces cut in Tennessee as well as the establishment of Buffalo Pottery in 1901 to meet the demand for premiums. The Greensburg, Pennsylvania Glass Company produced all of the bottles and related glassware and contracts were negotiated with Oneida to furnish plated silverware and the Buffalo Garment Center made men's apparel. Auburn, NY in 1902300x300px The Larkin company later recruited housewives, called \\"Larkin Secretaries,\\" and neighborhood children to market their products door-to-door, much like Avon products are now sold. The Larkin Secretaries organized \\"Larkin Clubs\\" of ten members that were set up so each month each member of the club would pledge to order $1 worth of Larkin goods. One member was then selected at random to receive the $10 premium and the next month the premium would go to another member. The period from 1892 to 1904 saw rapid growth in sales from just under $500,000 () to over $13,000,000 () in 1904. By 1901, Larkin was big enough to have its own building at the Pan-American Exposition. By 1905, the catalog was offering over 115 products, including soaps, toiletries, shampoo, coffee and teas, extracts, cocoa, spices, chocolate, soups, perfumes. By 1912, the Larkin Catalogue was second only to the Sears Catalog in variety of products being offered. Tremendous amounts of Larkin advertising were produced including flyers, magazines, catalogs and brochures. \\"The Larkin Idea\\" was a promotional magazine for the club secretaries that listed new products and marketing strategies and encouraged members to set up \\"Larkin Pantries,\\" whole areas in their homes stocked with Larkin goods as a way to generate sales from their neighbors. The company promoted home decorating with the \\"Larkin Look.\\" By 1920, a home could be completely decorated with Larkin goods, from furniture to rugs, silverware, table lamps, curtains, clocks, school supplies, toys, jewelry, clothing, and bibles. Branch offices were opened all over the country, including Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago. 500x150px By 1925, Larkin had approximately 900 catalog items and factories covering sixteen-and-a-half acres and reached peak levels in the late 1920s with over 1,000 products and average yearly sales were $15.5 million and over 4,000 employees. Later years Elbert Hubbard retired in the 1890s, and went on to found the Roycroft artisan community in East Aurora, New York, a realization of the Arts and Crafts Movement. He and his second wife, Alice Moore Hubbard, died aboard the RMS Lusitania, when it was sunk by a German submarine on May 7, 1915. Darwin D. Martin became Corporate Secretary and guided the company through its rise to a Corporate Institution until his retirement in 1925. He created a unique card ledger system for tracking sales and maintaining accounts which is utilized by many corporations, in various formats, to this day. He was instrumental in Frank Lloyd Wright receiving the commission to design the Larkin Administration Building, his home in Buffalo and a summer home called Graycliff. John D. Larkin died in 1926 at which point John D. Larkin Jr. took over control of the company. The growth of department stores, the popularity of the automobile and the volatility of the marketplace, especially during the Great Depression, damaged the Larkin Company's mail-order business. John D. Larkin, Jr. attempted to diversify Larkin with a chain of retail food markets, gasoline stations, home craft stores, and a department store, but ultimately all efforts were unsuccessful. Internal struggles among the next generation of Larkin executives and the loss of key executives, precipitated the demise of the company. Sales fell from a high of $28.6 million in 1920 to $2 million by 1939. The company was sold in 1941, liquidated in 1942, and the new owners continued a mail-order business until 1962. Larkin Buildings 300x300px By 1902, Larkin needed a building to consolidate offices scattered throughout all of his factories. Martin, and William Heath, Larkin's brother-in-law and the head of the Legal Department, suggested Frank Lloyd Wright. Larkin consented and Wright received his first commercial commission, the Larkin Administration Building which was completed in 1904 and accommodated 1,800 corresponding secretaries, clerks, and executives. The Larkin Administration Building was demolished in 1950. Larkin, known for its generous corporate culture, also commissioned Wright to design row houses for its workers, which were never built. Originally published in Buffalo Spree, July‚ÄìAugust 2006, p. 150. A large portion of the original Larkin manufacturing complex survives today including the Larkin Terminal Warehouse which has been converted to corporate offices and housed the headquarters of First Niagara Bank, which has been acquired by KeyBank. The surrounding neighborhood is now called \\"Larkinville\\" and has been converted into a mixed-use area.

The road was originally laid out in 1794 from Baggs Square in downtown Utica (then Old Fort Schuyler) at the ford of the Mohawk River and followed the Indian trail past Syracuse to Canandaigua. Some accounts say it went to Geneva and Avon originally. There was no City of Syracuse then. The road became known as the Seneca Turnpike, which was long and, at the time, the longest toll road in the state. On April 1, 1800, the privately held Seneca Road Company received a state charter with a capitalization of $110,000. This was a stock company with prominent local investors including Jedediah Sanger, Benjamin Walker, John Kirkland, and Wilhelmus Mynderss. The company received a land grant of a right of way, but the roadway was . The firm was required to clear a road wide of all trees. Completed to Canandaigua by 1808, it reached Buffalo in 1813. Other state stipulations were * the fare would be (equivalent to in ) * four horses be used per coach * a maximum of 12 passengers per coach * speed of * coaches also carry U.S. Mail. The road quickly led to the building of many hotels and inns along the route and was a catalyst of commerce. Toll gates were at intervals. The company was profitable and paid dividends of 10 percent for 30 years. Competition from newly constructed railroads in the late 1830s reduced traffic. In 1846, with revenues insufficient to maintain the turnpike, the company concluded it could no longer compete and be profitable. It surrendered its charter back to New York State thus ending the private phase of the Seneca Turnpike. The company was dissolved and the roadway reverted to a public road. The roadway is still in existence as part of New York State Route 5 and is still called the Seneca Turnpike or Old Seneca Turnpike in some places.

Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has said with a medium level of confidence that it is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office as well as security firms SecureWorks, ThreatConnect, and Fireeye's Mandiant, have also said the group is sponsored by the Russian government. In 2018, an indictment by the United States Special Counsel identified Fancy Bear as two GRU units known as Unit 26165 and Unit 74455. The name \\"Fancy Bear\\" comes from a coding system security researcher Dmitri Alperovitch uses to identify hackers. Likely operating since the mid-2000s, Fancy Bear's methods are consistent with the capabilities of state actors. The group targets government, military, and security organizations, especially Transcaucasian and NATO-aligned states. Fancy Bear is thought to be responsible for cyber attacks on the German parliament, the French television station TV5Monde, the White House, NATO, the Democratic National Committee, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron. The group promotes the political interests of the Russian government, and is known for hacking Democratic National Committee emails to attempt to influence the outcome of the United States 2016 presidential elections. Fancy Bear is classified by Fireeye as an advanced persistent threat. Among other things, it uses zero-day exploits, spear phishing and malware to compromise targets. Discovery and security reports Trend Micro designated the actors behind the Sofacy malware as Operation Pawn Storm on October 22, 2014. The name was due to the group's use of \\"two or more connected tools/tactics to attack a specific target similar to the chess strategy,\\" known as pawn storm. Network security firm FireEye released a detailed report on Fancy Bear in October 2014. The report designated the group as \\"Advanced Persistent Threat 28\\" (APT28) and described how the hacking group used zero-day exploits of the Microsoft Windows operating system and Adobe Flash. The report found operational details indicating that the source is a \\"government sponsor based in Moscow\\". Evidence collected by FireEye suggested that Fancy Bear's malware was compiled primarily in a Russian-language build environment and occurred mainly during work hours paralleling Moscow's time zone. FireEye director of threat intelligence Laura Galante referred to the group's activities as \\"state espionage\\" and said that targets also include \\"media or influencers.\\" The name \\"Fancy Bear\\" is derived from the coding system that Dmitri Alperovitch uses for hacker groups. \\"Bear\\" indicates that the hackers are from Russia. Fancy refers to \\"Sofacy\\", a word in the malware that reminded the analyst who found it, of Iggy Azalea's song \\"Fancy\\". Attacks Fancy Bear's targets have included Eastern European governments and militaries, the country of Georgia and the Caucasus, Ukraine, security-related organizations such as NATO, as well as US defense contractors Academi (formerly known as Blackwater), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon. Fancy Bear has also attacked citizens of the Russian Federation that are political enemies of the Kremlin, including former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Maria Alekhina of the band Pussy Riot. SecureWorks, a cybersecurity firm headquartered in the United States, concluded that from March 2015 to May 2016, the \\"Fancy Bear\\" target list included not merely the United States Democratic National Committee, but tens of thousands of foes of Putin and the Kremlin in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, and Syria. Only a handful of Republicans were targeted, however. An AP analysis of 4,700 email accounts that had been attacked by Fancy Bear concluded that no country other than Russia would be interested in hacking so many very different targets that seemed to have nothing else in common other than their being of interest to the Russian government. Fancy Bear also seems to try to influence political events in order for friends or allies of the Russian government to gain power. In 2011‚Äì2012, Fancy Bear's first-stage malware was the \\"Sofacy\\" or SOURFACE implant. During 2013, Fancy Bear added more tools and backdoors, including CHOPSTICK, CORESHELL, JHUHUGIT, and ADVSTORESHELL. =Attacks on prominent journalists in Russia, the United States, Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltics, and elsewhere= From mid-2014 until the fall of 2017, Fancy Bear targeted numerous journalists in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, the Baltics, and other countries who had written articles about Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. According to the Associated Press and SecureWorks, this group of journalists is the third largest group targeted by Fancy Bear after diplomatic personnel and U.S. Democrats. Fancy Bear's targeted list includes Adrian Chen, the Armenian journalist Maria Titizian, Eliot Higgins at Bellingcat, Ellen Barry and at least 50 other New York Times reporters, at least 50 foreign correspondents based in Moscow who worked for independent news outlets, Josh Rogin, a Washington Post columnist, Shane Harris, a Daily Beast writer who in 2015 covered intelligence issues, Michael Weiss, a CNN security analyst, Jamie Kirchick with the Brookings Institution, 30 media targets in Ukraine, many at the Kyiv Post, reporters who covered the Russian-backed war in eastern Ukraine, as well as in Russia where the majority of journalists targeted by the hackers worked for independent news (e.g. Novaya Gazeta or Vedomosti) such as Ekaterina Vinokurova at Znak.com and mainstream Russian journalists Tina Kandelaki, Ksenia Sobchak, and the Russian television anchor Pavel Lobkov, all of which worked for Dozhd. =German attacks (from 2014)= Fancy Bear is thought to have been responsible for a six-month-long cyber-attack on the German parliament that began in December 2014. On 5 May 2020, German federal prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Dimitri Badin in relation with the attacks. The attack completely paralyzed the Bundestag's IT infrastructure in May 2015. To resolve the situation, the entire parliament had to be taken offline for days. IT experts estimate that a total of 16 gigabytes of data were downloaded from Parliament as part of the attack. The group is also suspected to be behind a spear phishing attack in August 2016 on members of the Bundestag and multiple political parties such as Linken-faction leader Sahra Wagenknecht, Junge Union and the CDU of Saarland. Authorities feared that sensitive information could be gathered by hackers to later manipulate the public ahead of elections such as Germany's next federal election which was due in September 2017. =U.S. military wives' death threats (February 10, 2015)= Five wives of U.S. military personnel received death threats from a hacker group calling itself \\"CyberCaliphate\\", claiming to be an Islamic State affiliate, on February 10, 2015. This was later discovered to have been a false flag attack by Fancy Bear, when the victims' email addresses were found to have been in the Fancy Bear phishing target list. Russian social media trolls have also been known to hype and rumor monger the threat of potential Islamic State terror attacks on U.S. soil in order to sow fear and political tension. =French television hack (April 2015)= On April 8, 2015, French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyber-attack by a hacker group calling itself \\"CyberCaliphate\\" and claiming to have ties to the terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). French investigators later discounted the theory that militant Islamists were behind the cyber-attack, instead suspecting the involvement of Fancy Bear. Hackers breached the network's internal systems, possibly aided by passwords openly broadcast by TV5,Hacked French network exposed its own passwords during TV interview - arstechnica overriding the broadcast programming of the company's 12 channels for over three hours. Service was only partially restored in the early hours of the following morning and normal broadcasting services were disrupted late into April 9. Various computerised internal administrative and support systems including e-mail were also still shut down or otherwise inaccessible due to the attack. The hackers also hijacked TV5Monde's Facebook and Twitter pages to post the personal information of relatives of French soldiers participating in actions against ISIS, along with messages critical of President Fran√ßois Hollande, arguing that the January 2015 terrorist attacks were \\"gifts\\" for his \\"unforgivable mistake\\" of partaking in conflicts that \\"[serve] no purpose\\". The director-general of TV5Monde, Yves Bigot, later said that the attack nearly destroyed the company; if it had taken longer to restore broadcasting, satellite distribution channels would have been likely to cancel their contracts. The attack was designed to be destructive, both of equipment and of the company itself, rather than for propaganda or espionage, as had been the case for most other cyber-attacks. The attack was carefully planned; the first known penetration of the network was on January 23, 2015. The attackers then carried out reconnaissance of TV5Monde to understand the way in which it broadcast its signals, and constructed bespoke malicious software to corrupt and destroy the Internet-connected hardware that controlled the TV station's operations, such as the encoder systems. They used seven different points of entry, not all part of TV5Monde or even in France‚Äîone was a company based in the Netherlands that supplied the remote controlled cameras used in TV5's studios. Between February 16 and March 25 the attackers collected data on TV5 internal platforms, including its IT Internal Wiki, and verified that login credentials were still valid. During the attack, the hackers ran a series of commands extracted from TACACS logs to erase the firmware from switches and routers. Although the attack purported to be from IS, France's cyber-agency told Bigot to say only that the messages claimed to be from IS. He was later told that evidence had been found that the attackers were the APT 28 group of Russian hackers. No reason was found for the targeting of TV5Monde, and the source of the order to attack, and funding for it, is not known. It has been speculated that it was probably an attempt to test forms of cyber-weaponry. The cost was estimated at ‚Ç¨5m ($5.6m; ¬£4.5m) in the first year, followed by recurring annual cost of over ‚Ç¨3m ($3.4m; ¬£2.7m) for new protection. The company's way of working had to change, with authentication of email, checking of flash drives before insertion, and so on, at significant detriment to efficiency for a news media company that must move information. =root9B report (May 2015)= Security firm root9B released a report on Fancy Bear in May 2015 announcing its discovery of a targeted spear phishing attack aimed at financial institutions. The report listed international banking institutions that were targeted, including the United Bank for Africa, Bank of America, TD Bank, and UAE Bank. According to the root9B, preparations for the attacks started in June 2014 and the malware used \\"bore specific signatures that have historically been unique to only one organization, Sofacy.\\" Security journalist Brian Krebs questioned the accuracy of root9B's claims, postulating that the attacks had actually originated from Nigerian phishers. In June 2015 well respected security researcher Claudio Guarnieri published a report based on his own investigation of a concurrent SOFACY attributed exploit against the German Bundestag and credited root9B with having reported, \\"the same IP address used as Command & Control server in the attack against Bundestag (176.31.112.10)\\", and went on to say that based on his examination of the Bundestag attack, \\"at least some\\" indicators contained within root9B's report appeared accurate, including a comparison of the hash of the malware sample from both incidents. root9B later published a technical report comparing Claudio's analysis of SOFACY attributed malware to their own sample, adding to the veracity of their original report. =EFF spoof, White House and NATO attack (August 2015)= In August 2015, Fancy Bear used a zero-day exploit of Java, spoofing the Electronic Frontier Foundation and launching attacks on the White House and NATO. The hackers used a spear phishing attack, directing emails to the false url electronicfrontierfoundation.org. =World Anti-Doping Agency (August 2016)= In August 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported the receipt of phishing emails sent to users of its database claiming to be official WADA communications requesting their login details. After reviewing the two domains provided by WADA, it was found that the websites' registration and hosting information were consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear. According to WADA, some of the data the hackers released had been forged. Due to evidence of widespread doping by Russian athletes, WADA recommended that Russian athletes be barred from participating in the 2016 Rio Olympics and Paralympics. Analysts said they believed the hack was in part an act of retaliation against whistleblowing Russian athlete Yuliya Stepanova, whose personal information was released in the breach. In August 2016, WADA revealed that their systems had been breached, explaining that hackers from Fancy Bear had used an International Olympic Committee (IOC)-created account to gain access to their Anti-doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) database. The hackers then used the website fancybear.net to leak what they said were the Olympic drug testing files of several athletes who had received therapeutic use exemptions, including gymnast Simone Biles, tennis players Venus and Serena Williams and basketball player Elena Delle Donne. The hackers honed in on athletes who had been granted exemptions by WADA for various reasons. Subsequent leaks included athletes from many other countries. =Dutch Safety Board and Bellingcat= Eliot Higgins and other journalists associated with Bellingcat, a group researching the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, were targeted by numerous spearphishing emails. The messages were fake Gmail security notices with Bit.ly and TinyCC shortened URLs. According to ThreatConnect, some of the phishing emails had originated from servers that Fancy Bear had used in previous attacks elsewhere. Bellingcat is known for having demonstrated that Russia is culpable for the shooting down of MH17, and is frequently derided by the Russian media. The group targeted the Dutch Safety Board, the body conducting the official investigation into the crash, before and after the release of the board's final report. They set up fake SFTP and VPN servers to mimic the board's own servers, likely for the purpose of spearphishing usernames and passwords. A spokesman for the DSB said the attacks were not successful. =Democratic National Committee (2016)= Fancy Bear carried out spear phishing attacks on email addresses associated with the Democratic National Committee in the first quarter of 2016. On March 10, phishing emails that were mainly directed at old email addresses of 2008 Democratic campaign staffers began to arrive. One of these accounts may have yielded up to date contact lists. The next day, phishing attacks expanded to the non-public email addresses of high level Democratic Party officials. Hillaryclinton.com addresses were attacked, but required two factor authentication for access. The attack redirected towards Gmail accounts on March 19. Podesta's Gmail account was breached the same day, with 50,000 emails stolen. The phishing attacks intensified in April, although the hackers seemed to become suddenly inactive for the day on April 15, which in Russia was a holiday in honor of the military's electronic warfare services. The malware used in the attack sent stolen data to the same servers that were used for the group's 2015 attack on the German parliament. On June 14, CrowdStrike released a report publicizing the DNC hack and identifying Fancy Bear as the culprits. An online persona, Guccifer 2.0, then appeared, claiming sole credit for the breach. Another sophisticated hacking group attributed to the Russian Federation, nicknamed Cozy Bear, was also present in the DNC's servers at the same time. However the two groups each appeared to be unaware of the other, as each independently stole the same passwords and otherwise duplicated their efforts. Cozy Bear appears to be a different agency, one more interested in traditional long-term espionage. A CrowdStrike forensic team determined that while Cozy Bear had been on the DNC's network for over a year, Fancy Bear had only been there a few weeks. =Ukrainian artillery= D-30 Howitzer was allegedly distributed to the Ukrainian artillery According to CrowdStrike from 2014 to 2016, the group used Android malware to target the Ukrainian Army's Rocket Forces and Artillery. They distributed an infected version of an Android app whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the D-30 Howitzer artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the X-Agent spyware and posted online on military forums. CrowdStrike initially claimed that more than 80% of Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers were destroyed in the war, the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army (a percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the Ukrainian Armed Forces). According to the Ukrainian army CrowdStrike's numbers were incorrect and that losses in artillery weapons \\"were way below those reported\\" and that these losses \\"have nothing to do with the stated cause\\". CrowdStrike has since revised this report after the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) disavowed its original report, claiming that the malware hacks resulted in losses of 15‚Äì20% rather than their original figure of 80%. =Windows zero-day (October 2016)= On October 31, 2016, Google's Threat Analysis Group revealed a zero-day vulnerability in most Microsoft Windows versions that is the subject of active malware attacks. On November 1, 2016, Microsoft Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group Terry Myerson posted to Microsoft's Threat Research & Response Blog, acknowledging the vulnerability and explaining that a \\"low-volume spear-phishing campaign\\" targeting specific users had utilized \\"two zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the down-level Windows kernel.\\" Microsoft pointed to Fancy Bear as the threat actor, referring to the group by their in-house code name STRONTIUM. =Dutch ministries (February 2017)= In February 2017, the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) of the Netherlands revealed that Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear had made several attempts to hack into Dutch ministries, including the Ministry of General Affairs, over the previous six months. Rob Bertholee, head of the AIVD, said on EenVandaag that the hackers were Russian and had tried to gain access to secret government documents. In a briefing to parliament, Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Ronald Plasterk announced that votes for the Dutch general election in March 2017 would be counted by hand. =IAAF hack (February 2017)= The officials of International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) stated in April 2017 that its servers had been hacked by the \\"Fancy Bear\\" group. The attack was detected by cybersecurity firm Context Information Security which identified that an unauthorised remote access to IAAF's servers had taken place on February 21. IAAF stated that the hackers had accessed the Therapeutic Use Exemption applications, needed to use medications prohibited by WADA. =German and French elections (2016‚Äì2017)= Researchers from Trend Micro in 2017 released a report outlining attempts by Fancy Bear to target groups related to the election campaigns of Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. According to the report, they targeted the Macron campaign with phishing and attempting to install malware on their site. French government cybersecurity agency ANSSI confirmed these attacks took place, but could not confirm APT28's responsibility. Marine Le Pen's campaign does not appear to have been targeted by APT28, possibly indicating Russian preference for her campaign. Putin had previously touted the benefits to Russia if Marine Le Pen were elected. The report says they then targeted the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation and Friedrich Ebert Foundation, groups that are associated with Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and opposition Social Democratic Party, respectively. Fancy Bear set up fake email servers in late 2016 to send phishing emails with links to malware. =International Olympic Committee (2018)= On January 10, 2018, the \\"Fancy Bears Hack Team\\" online persona leaked what appeared to be stolen International Olympic Committee (IOC) and U.S. Olympic Committee emails, dated from late 2016 to early 2017, were leaked in apparent retaliation for the IOC's banning of Russian athletes from the 2018 Winter Olympics as a sanction for Russia's systematic doping program. The attack resembles the earlier World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) leaks. It is not known whether the emails are fully authentic, because of Fancy Bear's history of salting stolen emails with disinformation. The mode of attack was also not known, but was probably phishing.Rebecca R. Ruiz, Rebecca Russian Hackers Release Stolen Emails in New Effort to Undermine Doping Investigators, New York Times (January 10, 2018). Cyber Security experts have also claimed that attacks also appear to have been targeting the professional sports drug test bottling company known as the Berlinger Group.Nick Griffin, Performanta, (January 26, 2018). =Swedish Sports Confederation= The Swedish Sports Confederation reported Fancy Bear was responsible for an attack on its computers, targeting records of athletes' doping tests. =United States conservative groups (2018)= The software company Microsoft reported in August 2018 that the group had attempted to steal data from political organizations such as the International Republican Institute and the Hudson Institute think tanks. The attacks were thwarted when Microsoft security staff won control of six net domains. In its announcement Microsoft advised that \\"we currently have no evidence these domains were used in any successful attacks before the DCU transferred control of them, nor do we have evidence to indicate the identity of the ultimate targets of any planned attack involving these domains\\". =The Ecumenical Patriarchate and other clergy (August 2018)= According to the August 2018 report by the Associated Press, Fancy Bear had been for years targeting the email correspondence of the officials of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople headed by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I. The publication appeared at a time of heightened tensions between the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the seniormost of all the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Russian Orthodox Church (the Moscow Patriarchate) over the issue of the full ecclesiastical independence (autocephaly) for the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, sought after by the Ukrainian government. The publication cited experts as saying that the grant of autocephaly to the Church in Ukraine would erode the power and prestige of the Moscow Patriarchate and would undermine its claims of transnational jurisdiction. Cyber attacks also targeted Orthodox Christians in other countries as well as Muslims, Jews and Catholics in the United States, Ummah, an umbrella group for Ukrainian Muslims, the papal nuncio in Kiev and Yosyp Zisels, who directs Ukraine's Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities. =Indictments in 2018= In October 2018, an indictment by a U.S. federal grand jury of seven Russian men, all GRU officers, in relation to the attacks was unsealed. The indictment states that from December 2014 until a least May 2018, the GRU officers conspired to conduct \\"persistent and sophisticated computer intrusions affecting U.S. persons, corporate entities, international organizations, and their respective employees located around the world, based on their strategic interest to the Russian government.\\" The U.S. Department of Justice stated that the conspiracy, among other goals, aimed \\"to publicize stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize\\" the efforts of the World Anti-Doping Agency, an international anti-doping organization that had published the McLaren Report, a report that exposed extensive doping of Russian athletes sponsored by the Russian government. The defendants were charged with computer hacking, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. =2019 think tank attacks= In February 2019, Microsoft announced that it had detected spear-phishing attacks from APT28, aimed at employees of the German Marshall Fund, Aspen Institute Germany, and the German Council on Foreign Relations. Hackers from the group purportedly sent phishing e-mails to 104 email addresses across Europe in an attempt to gain access to employer credentials and infect sites with malware. = 2019 strategic Czech institution = In 2020 Czech reported cyber espionage incident in an unnamed strategic institution, possibly the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, carried out most likely by Fancy Bear. = 2020 arrest warrant of German authorities= In 2020 German officials named Dimitri Badin, an officer of the GRU and suspected member of APT28, as main suspect for the cyber- attacks on the Bundestag up from 2015. According to German news magazine Der Spiegel, investigators from the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) have clarified Badin's identity in painstakingly detailed work. The BKA and the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) were also involved. The cyber defense experts of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), who dealt with the virtual movements of the Russian attackers on a monitored server, also played an important role. Characteristics and techniques Diagram showing Grizzly Steppe's (Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear) process of employing spear phishing Fancy Bear employs advanced methods consistent with the capabilities of state actors. They use spear phishing emails, malware drop websites disguised as news sources, and zero-day vulnerabilities. One cybersecurity research group noted their use of no less than six different zero-day exploits in 2015, a considerable technical feat that would require large numbers of programmers seeking out previously unknown vulnerabilities in top of the line commercial software. This is a sign that Fancy Bear is a state-run program and not a gang or a lone hacker. One of Fancy Bear's preferred targets is web-based email services. A typical compromise will consist of web-based email users receiving an email urgently requesting that they change their passwords to avoid being hacked. The email will contain a link to a spoof website that is designed to mimic a real webmail interface, users will attempt to login and their credentials will be stolen. The URL is often obscured as a shortened bit.ly link in order to get past spam filters. Fancy Bear sends these phishing emails primarily on Mondays and Fridays. They also send emails purportedly containing links to news items, but instead linking to malware drop sites that install toolkits onto the target's computer. Fancy Bear also registers domains that resemble legitimate websites, then create a spoof of the site to steal credentials from their victims. Fancy Bear has been known to relay its command traffic through proxy networks of victims that it has previously compromised. Software that Fancy Bear has used includes ADVSTORESHELL, CHOPSTICK, JHUHUGIT, and XTunnel. Fancy Bear utilises a number of implants, including Foozer, WinIDS, X-Agent, X-Tunnel, Sofacy, and DownRange droppers. Based on compile times, FireEye concluded that Fancy Bear has consistently updated their malware since 2007. To avert detection, Fancy Bear returns to the environment to switch their implants, changes its command and control channels, and modifies its persistent methods. The threat group implements counter-analysis techniques to obfuscate their code. They add junk data to encoded strings, making decoding difficult without the junk removal algorithm. Fancy Bear takes measures to prevent forensic analysis of its hacks, resetting the timestamps on files and periodically clearing the event logs. According to an indictment by the United States Special Counsel, X-Agent was \\"developed, customized, and monitored\\" by GRU Lieutenant Captain Nikolay Yuryevich Kozachek. Fancy Bear has been known to tailor implants for target environments, for instance reconfiguring them to use local email servers. In August 2015, Kaspersky Lab detected and blocked a version of the ADVSTORESHELL implant that had been used to target defense contractors. An hour and a half following the block, Fancy Bear actors had compiled and delivered a new backdoor for the implant. Education Unit 26165 was involved in the design of the curriculum at several Moscow public schools, including School 1101. Related personas Fancy Bear sometimes creates online personas to sow disinformation, deflect blame, and create plausible deniability for their activities. =Guccifer 2.0= An online persona that first appeared and claimed responsibility for the DNC hacks the same day the story broke that Fancy Bear was responsible. Guccifer 2.0 claims to be a Romanian hacker, but when interviewed by Motherboard magazine, they were asked questions in Romanian and appeared to be unable to speak the language. Some documents they have released appear to be forgeries cobbled together from material from previous hacks and publicly available information, then salted with disinformation. =Fancy Bears' Hack Team= A website created to leak documents taken in the WADA and IAAF attacks was fronted with a brief manifesto dated September 13, 2016, proclaiming that the site is owned by \\"Fancy Bears' hack team\\", which it said is an \\"international hack team\\" who \\"stand for fair play and clean sport\\". The site took responsibility for hacking WADA and promised that it would provide \\"sensational proof of famous athletes taking doping substances\\", beginning with the US Olympic team, which it said \\"disgraced its name by tainted victories\\". WADA said some of the documents leaked under this name were forgeries, and that data had been changed. =Anonymous Poland= A Twitter account named \\"Anonymous Poland\\" (@) claimed responsibility for the attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency and released data stolen from the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a secondary target. ThreatConnect supports the view that Anonymous Poland is a sockpuppet of Fancy Bear, noting the change from a historical focus on internal politics. A screen capture video uploaded by Anonymous Poland shows an account with Polish language settings, but their browser history showed that they had made searches in Google.ru (Russia) and Google.com (US), but not in Google.pl (Poland).

He is known for his Monument to Dante (1857-1865) in the Piazza Santa Croce, Florence, and for the Prince Mihailo Monument in the center of Serbian capital city Belgrade.  Biography  In 1833, he enrolled in the Institute of Fine Arts of Ravenna, his birthplace, under Ignazio Sarti.Enciclopedia Dantesca (1970), entry for Treccani enciclopedia, entry by Camillo Semenzato. He was fired after an angry outburst where he destroyed one of his incomplete works at the eve of the yearly exhibition. With the help of the cardinal Legate of the city, Luigi Amat, he was readmitted to the Academy.Ricordi d'arte, by Enrico Pazzi, (autobiography),Tipografia Cooperativa, Via Monalda #1, Florence (1887), pages 11-15. With a stipend from the Academy, he moved to Florence and worked under the mentorship (1845-1851) of Giovanni Dupr√®. Enrico opened a studio on Via dei Maccheroni with fellow artist from Ravenna, Luigi Majoli.  Monument to Dante  Monument to Dante, Florence Monument to Savonarola, Florence In the early 1850s, a project for a statue of Dante for a piazza in Ravenna was declined. Pazzi subsisted on small private projects for tomb monuments and house decorations. He completed for Dupre a commission for a nativity scene, destined for the Signora Bianchi of Siena, however, had difficulty getting paid.Pazzi, page 46-48 In the 1857‚Äì59, a move was made to complete the Dante statue, but now for Florence. The patriotic Pazzi recalls an unfortunate episode when the Prince Leopold, Count of Syracuse (brother of the King of Naples) visited the studio accompanied by the interior minister of the Grand Duke, Leopold II. The visiting Prince inquired why Dante was surrounded by beasts. Pazzi indicated the lions were the Marzocchi, long a symbol of Medici Florence. However, when asked why the eagle did not have a double head, the symbol of the Habsburg dynasty, Pazzi impertinently replied that this was a Roman Eagle, arising from the ashes of the fallen Roman Empire. With this, the retinue left. Pazzi's statue would take nearly half a decade to rise in the piazza.Pazzi, page 56. Pazzi's Monument to Savonarola would also have a tortuous and controversial route to finding a home in Florence.

She managed to get a minimum qualifying standard of 583 in small-bore rifle three positions to join with fellow markswoman and four-time Olympian √âva Jo√≥ and secure an Olympic berth for Hungary, following her bronze medal triumph at the ISSF World Cup meet in Changwon, South Korea a year earlier. In the 10 m air rifle, held on the first day of the Games, Krzyzewsky fired a modest 387 out of a possible 400 to obtain a thirty-seventh position throughout a 44-shooter field. Nearly a week later, in the 50 m rifle 3 positions, Krzyzewsky put up another substandard aim to land in thirty-first with a total score of 560 points (a scintillating 195 in prone, 178 in standing and 187 in the kneeling series). In 2007, Krzyzewsky showed her most potential form in bouncing back to the range by claiming her first individual gold in the small-bore rifle prone at the European Championships in Granada, Spain, shooting comfortably at 591 points. Outside her shooting career, Krzyzewsky is a political science graduate at P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University, and currently works as a professional lawyer.

Clapp (born 1930) is a computer scientist who began her career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and subsequently moved to the Lincoln Laboratory and then to MITRE, where she was involved in the Semi- Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) military project, including the development of the SAGE computer. Early life and education Clapp was born in 1930 and was raised in Long Island, New York. She received her bachelor's degree in math and physics in 1951 from Smith College and her master's degree in applied science (which she described as the closest match to computer science available at the time) in 1952 from Radcliffe College, then a women's affiliate of Harvard University. Career After graduating from Radcliffe Clapp began work at MIT, the only woman among the early programmers of the Whirlwind I, the first real-time computer. The Whirlwind, a vacuum tube computer, had originally been commissioned by the United States Navy but was subsequently financed by the Air Force for the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) project. Clapp continued to work on the project after its transfer to the Lincoln Laboratory and later to the MITRE Corporation, eventually becoming a Senior Principal Software Systems Engineer at MITRE. After the SAGE project Clapp continued to work in management at MITRE and participated in the Department of Defense Working Group that led to the development of the Ada programming language. Legacy Clapp's work is regarded as important groundwork for the development of software engineering as a discipline. She was involved in early professional organizations for women in computing and is recognized as a pioneer among women in the field. Clapp received an Achievement Award from the Society of Women Engineers in 2001. In 2005, she received the Smith College Medal. Her work and thoughts on working on the SAGE project were also discussed in the book Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing.

It is a shrub with wart-like tubercles covering its branches and leaves, especially on the upper surface and white flowers spotted with mauve, or all blue-mauve, present for most of the warmer months. Description Myoporum caprarioides is an erect shrub which grows to a height of and has wart-like tubercles covering its branches and leaves. The leaves are arranged alternately and are flat, not succulent, long and wide. They are elliptic in shape with minute serrations on the edges. The upper surface is shinier and darker than the lower surface which has a raised midrib. The flowers appear singly or in small groups in the axils of the leaves and have 5 sepals and 5 white spotted pink or entirely pink petals joined at their base to form a tube. The tube is long and the lobes are spreading and long. There are 4 stamens which extend beyond the petals. Flowering occurs throughout the whole year, apart from the coldest months and is followed by brown fruits which are drupes, in diameter and roughly spherical in shape. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum caprarioides was first formally described in 1837 by George Bentham in Stephan Endlicher's Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandi√¶ ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de H√ºgel. The specific epithet refers to a similarity to the genus Capraria.

It is mainly spread during the summer by different mosquito species in the United States and Canada. The virus is one of a group of mosquito-borne or arthropod-borne viruses, also called arboviruses, that can cause fever and meningitis or meningoencephalitis, mostly in adults. Jamestown Canyon virus disease is relatively rare; in the United States, the CDC found only 31 disease cases from 2000 to 2013, but it is likely under-recognized and probably endemic throughout most of the United States. Signs and symptoms About 2 days to 2 weeks after the bite of an infected mosquito, disease symptoms of a nonspecific summertime illness with sore throat, runny nose and cough, followed by fever, headache, nausea and vomiting can develop. Neuroinvasive disease occurs in two thirds of reported cases and is characterized by severe headache and neck stiffness as in meningitis or increasing lethargy and altered mental status up to coma as in meningoencephalitis. No acute flaccid paralysis, no death and no acquisition from a blood transfusion has ever been reported. Virology The Jamestown Canyon virus is an orthobunyavirus and was first isolated in 1961 from Culiseta mosquitoes in Jamestown, Colorado. Since then it has been found in Aedes, Coquillettidia perturbans, Culex, Culiseta and Ochlerotatus species in northern states of the mainland US, in various mammals throughout mainland North America, and identified in humans throughout the United States. =Lifecycle= The virus is transmitted in saliva to a vertebrate host when an infected mosquito takes a blood meal. It thus cycles between mosquito and vertebrate amplifier hosts, mainly white- tailed deer. In a study from Newfoundland, JCV was significantly associated with large mammals such as sheep, cattle and horses. In Michigan and Ontario moose and bison are believed to be the primary reservoir. The virus winters in mosquito eggs, which it reaches by transovarial transmission. The female mosquito lays eggs that carry the virus, and the offspring can transmit the virus to deer or ruminants and humans. Infected mosquitoes were found equally distributed throughout the state of Connecticut, irrespective of land use. =Molecular biology= The full genome has been sequenced. The authors found a relatively high level of amino acid sequence conservation from viruses isolated 57 years apart \\"indicating that the virus is in relative evolutionary stasis\\". They also found JCV to be genetically similar to Inkoo virus in Northern Europe (Finland, Sweden), \\"suggesting that much of the northern hemisphere contains JCV or similar variants\\". The negative sense RNA genome is in three segments. The L segment encodes the L endonuclease (an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme) for genome replication and mRNA synthesis. The M segment encodes a polyprotein, further cleaved in the Gn and Gc surface glycoproteins for attachment and the NSm nonstructural protein that influences virulence. The S segment encodes the NSs protein for immune suppression and virulence, and the N structural nucleocapsid protein. Diagnosis The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a person with JCV infection laboratory-confirmed if: JCV isolated from or JCV-specific antigen or genomic sequences detected in tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or other body fluids; 2) equal or more than 4-fold change in JCV-specific neutralizing antibody titers between acute and convalescent samples; or 3) JCV or LACV IgM antibodies in serum with JCV-specific neutralizing antibodies equal or more than 4-fold higher than LACV-specific neutralizing antibody titers in the same specimen or a later specimen. JCV-antibody testing has only been available at the CDC and the New York State Department of Health. The CDC has used plaque reduction neutralization tests to detect JCV neutralizing antibodies since 1995. The test is automatically done on all samples testing positive or equivocal for La Crosse Virus IgM antibodies by ELISA. In 2010 CDC developed an ELISA also for JCV IgM . Similarly, the New York State Department of Health has performed JCV plaque reduction neutralization tests since 2000 on samples positive for California serogroup IgG antibodies. It does the latter by an immunofluorescence assay. Prior to the 1990s, the only tests for California serogroup virus infections performed by most state diagnostic laboratories were complement-fixation test and hemagglutination inhibition tests with La Crosse virus, but these failed to detect antibody to Jamestown Canyon virus. =Differential diagnosis= Besides La Crosse virus, other arboviruses producing similar disease in a similar geographic location include first and foremost West Nile virus, Powassan virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Saint Louis encephalitis and Western equine encephalitis virus, the latter two not being reportable to CDC. For 2013, CDC reported that of 22 JCV disease cases, 15 (68%) were neuroinvasive, which is a slightly higher percentage than for West Nile virus (51%), but less common than for the other arboviruses, with La Crosse virus being 91%, Eastern equine encephalitis virus 100% and Powassan virus 80% neuroinvasive. Treatment and prevention No specific therapy exists for arboviral infections; treatment is limited to supportive care and managing complications, such as relieving increased intracranial pressure. Preventing and decreasing the morbidity from JCV disease depends on control of the mosquito vectors and personal protection to reduce mosquito bites. The NIAID reported in 2012, that it had constructed a candidate virus for a live attenuated virus vaccine. Epidemiology Since 2004, the disease must be reported to CDC (passive surveillance, ArboNET). JCV has been mostly reported in adults rather than in children (median age 48 years versus 8 years), and is more likely to cause meningitis than encephalitis compared to illness caused by La Crosse virus. It also occurs throughout the summer (May until September), or even throughout the year rather than mostly in August, which may be due to the diversity of mosquitoes it can infect. ;Increasing awareness and more testing In the latest US review covering 2000‚Äì2013, more than half of cases were identified in 2013 alone, the first year the CDC implemented routine JCV IgM antibody testing. ;Geography Historically, most cases of encephalitis reported to the CDC occurred in the north of the mainland United States. JCV disease most likely has a broader distribution, but is unidentified and under-reported, because testing is not considered and not straightforward. In 2013, of 10 states reporting cases, eight states reported their first JCV cases: Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. In August 2015, the Iowa Department of Public Health confirmed one case of JCV. In July 2017, the Maine Center for Disease Control announced what is believed to be Maine's first known case. ;Season Historically disease was reported to occur from late spring through early fall. However, for 2013, dates of illness onset ranged from January through November, with 14 (64%) of the 22 cases occurring during July until September.

She has been selected to compete for Australia in small-bore rifle shooting at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and has yielded a tally of ten medals in a major international competition, spanning the Oceanian Championships and four editions of the Commonwealth Games (1994 to 2006). Before her retirement in 2006, Frazer also became a full-fledged member of Melbourne International Shooting Club, where she trained under the tutelage of John Dismore. Frazer began shooting at the age of eighteen with the Melbourne University Rifle Society, but achieved prominence internationally in 1994 and 1998, when she finished sixth each in the individual rifle prone, and then shared gold medals with Sylvia Purdie and Carrie Quigley respectively in the pairs at the Commonwealth Games. On her third attempt at Manchester 2002, Frazer shot a brilliant 588 to successfully capture her first individual Commonwealth Games gold in the rifle prone on a countback from South Africa's Esmari van Reenen. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Frazer qualified for her first ever Australian team, as a 45-year-old, in the 50 m rifle 3 positions. She managed to beat Robyn van Nus at the Olympic trials in Sydney to snatch one of Olympic berths that her teammate had claimed from the Oceanian Championships a year earlier. A less experienced to the sporting event, Frazer put up a lackluster feat by marking 192 in prone, a modest 175 in standing, and 184 in the kneeling series to accumulate a total score of 555 points in the qualifying round, closing her out of the final to round off the 33-shooter field with Macedonia's Divna Pe≈°iƒá in a two-way draw. When her native Melbourne hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games, Frazer and her partner Susannah Smith slipped out of the podium to fourth in the rifle prone pairs at 1160 points, just a single target behind second runner-up New Zealand. Since retiring from the competition shortly after her fourth Commonwealth Games, Frazer has continued her involvement with shooting both as a coach and an administrator.
