The revival of rationing originated in Leningrad after the City Soviet passed a resolution to ration bread in 1928. Moscow City Soviet soon introduced rationing, providing the supply of bread to workers using ration cards while simultaneously raising prices for non-workers. Kiev, Kharkov, and other big cities soon followed. In 1931, Politburo introduced a unified rationing system for foodstuffs and basic commodities and norms of rationing applied throughout the entire USSR. Besides bread, rationing applied to other foodstuffs, including products like sugar, tea, oil, butter, meat, and eggs. Rationing was applied only to people employed in the state-owned industries and to their family members. Such social categories as people without political rights known as lishentsy were deprived of rations. The lishentsy were also unable to access canteens, which served as a supplement to the rations. The rationing system was divided into four rates that differed in the size of rations, with lower rates unable to get such basic products as meat and fish. The rationing existed up to 1935, ending in six main stages.Elena Osokina, Za fasadom \\"stalinskogo izobiliia\\". Raspredeleniie i rynok v snabzhenii naseleniia v gody industrializatsii (Moscow, 1998). Beginning in May 1931, most industrial consumer goods were removed from the rationing system. Then, between March and April 1932, some food items began being removed from the rationing system. From 1932 to 1934, ration prices of foodstuffs and consumer goods were increased. The state also began selling increasing amounts of these goods off the rations at higher prices. At the beginning of 1935, the rationing of bread was abolished, followed by the end of rationing of all foodstuffs in October 1935. Rationing officially came to an end on January 1, 1936 when rationing of all industrial goods was abolished. Foreign specialists employed in Russia were supplied through a separately established organization Insnab. Perestroika The last, 12th Five-Year Plan that fell within the perestroika period ended with uncontrolled economical degradation, resulted in part in various ways of rationing in all Union republics. =Rationing of money= Perestroika produced a unique type of rationing: rationing of money. In 1990 in Byelorussia introduced a \\"Consumer's Card\\", which was a paper sheet sectioned into tear-off coupons with various designated monetary values: 20, 75, 100, 200, and 300 rubles. These coupons were required in addition to real money when purchasing certain categories of consumer goods. The coupons had next to none protection and could be easily counterfeited on modern colour copiers. (Copiers were scarce in the Soviet Union and under strict control of KGB, which to an extent limited, but did not eliminate, forging). The coupons were distributed at workplaces together with salary and had to bear the accountant's department stamp and signatures. This was an attempt to protect from profiteering, especially from profiteering by resales abroad.Bayura A.N., Paper Money Circulation in the Territory of Belarus in 18th-20th Centuries (–ë–∞—é—Ä–∞ –ê.–ù., –ë—É–º–∞–∂–Ω–æ-–¥–µ–Ω–µ–∂–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∏ –≤ XVIII - XX –≤–µ–∫–∞—Ö,) Brest, Brest State Technical University, 2003, See also *Blat (term) *Consumer goods in the Soviet Union References Economy of the Soviet Union Rationing by country ","title":"Rationing in the Soviet Union"},{"id":"4305999","text":"The wood snipe (Gallinago nemoricola) is a species of snipe which breeds in the Himalayas of northern India, Nepal, Bhutan and southern China.

Former Train Station, Aguascalientes, Mexico. Mexico has a freight railway system owned by the national government and operated by various entities under concessions (charters) granted by the national government. The railway system provides freight and passenger service throughout the country (the majority of the service is freight-oriented), connecting major industrial centers with ports and with rail connections at the United States border. Passenger rail services were limited to a number of tourist trains between 1997, when Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico suspended service, and 2008, when Ferrocarril Suburbano de la Zona Metropolitana de M√©xico inaugurated Mexico's first commuter rail service between Mexico City and the State of Mexico. This is not including the Mexico City Metro, which started service in 1969. History =Construction= Map of first Mexican rail line between Veracruz and Mexico City Mexican Central Railway train at station, Mexico. Rebel soldiers moving by rail during the Mexican Revolution Mexico's rail history began in 1837, with the granting of a concession for a railroad to be built between Veracruz, on the Gulf of Mexico, and Mexico City. However, no railroad was built under that concession. In 1857, Don Antonio Escand√≥n secured the right to build a line from the port of Veracruz to Mexico City and on to the Pacific Ocean. Revolution and political instability stifled progress on the financing or construction of the line until 1864, when, under the regime of Emperor Maximilian, the Imperial Mexican Railway Company began construction of the line. Political upheaval continued to stifle progress, and the initial segment from Veracruz to Mexico City was inaugurated nine years later on January 1, 1873 by President Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada. President Lerdo and his successor Porfirio D√≠az encouraged further rail development through generous concessions that included government subsidies for construction. At the beginning of his first term D√≠az inherited of railroads consisting almost exclusively of the British-owned Mexican Railway. By the end of his second term in 1910, Mexico boasted of in-service track, mostly built by American, British and French investors.Fred Wilbur Powell, the Railroads of Mexico, 1921 From a small start, the railway network expanded significantly, linking many parts of the country previously isolated. The Interoceanic Railway linked Mexico City to the port of Veracruz; the Monterrey and Mexican Railroad linked that northern city with the Gulf Coast port of Tampico; the Southern Pacific of Mexico linked west coast cities from Guaymas to Mazatlan; the Sonora Railway linked Nogales to the port of Guaymas; and the Mexican Central Railroad went north to the U.S. border at El Paso, Texas.Coatsworth, John H. Growth Against Development: The Economic Impact of Railroads in Porfirian Mexico. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University 1981. The British invested ¬£7.4 million in railways during the decade of the 1880s, jumping to ¬£53.4 million in 1910s. The decade-total of new investment in mining went from ¬£1.3 million in 1880s to ¬£11.6 million in 1910s. Investments in land and other properties rose from near zero in 1880s to ¬£19.7 million in 1910s. The totals reached ¬£135 million, almost as much as the United States.Tenenbaum, Barbara A. and James N. McElveen, \\"From speculative to substantive boom: the British in Mexico, 1821-1911.\\" in Oliver Marshall, ed. English speaking communities in Latin America (Macmillan, 2000): 51-79, at p 69. Growing nationalistic fervor in Mexico led the D√≠az administration to bring the bulk of the nation's railroads under national control through a plan drafted by his Minister of Finance, Jos√© Yves Limantour. The plan, implemented in 1909, created a new government corporation, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico (FNM), which would exercise control of the main trunk rail lines through a majority of share ownership. =Nationalization= The rail system deteriorated greatly from neglect during the period of the Mexican Revolution. Following the Revolution, the entirety of the Mexican rail system was nationalized between 1929 and 1937. In 1987 the government merged its five regional railroads into FNM. During the later period of national ownership, FNM suffered significant financial difficulties, running an operating deficit of $552 million (37 percent of its operating budget) in 1991. Competition from trucking and shipping decreased railroad's share of the total freight market to about 9 percent, or about half of rail's share a decade earlier. =Privatization= Map of Ferrocarril Mexicano system. In 1995, the Mexican government announced that the FNM would be privatized and divided into four main systems. As part of the restructuring for privatization, FNM suspended passenger rail service in 1997. Bust of Jose Rend√≥n Peniche who worked in the construction and then had charge the general direction of the first railway Yucatan, route Merida- Progreso. In 1996, Kansas City Southern (KCS), in a joint venture with Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM), bought the Northeast Railroad concession that linked Mexico City, Monterrey, the Pacific port at L√°zaro C√°rdenas and the border crossing at Laredo. The company was initially called Transportaci√≥n Ferroviaria Mexicana (TFM), but was renamed Kansas City Southern de M√©xico (KCSM) in 2005 when KCS bought out TMM's interests. KCS's systems in the United States and Mexico jointly form end-to-end rail system linking the heartlands of Mexico and the United States. The Northwest Railroad concession, connecting Mexico City and Guadalajara with the Pacific port of Manzanillo and various crossings along the United States border was sold to a joint venture between Grupo Mexico and Union Pacific Railroad in 1998 during the presidency of Dr. Ernesto Zedillo (which later occupied the position of Director of the Board of Union Pacific). The company operates as Ferrocarril Mexicano or Ferromex. Ferromex's freight volumes have increased; it hauled a record 22,365 million tonne-km in the first 6 months of 2010. Also, Ferrosur, the railroad serving Mexico City and cities/ports southeast of Mexico City, hauled their own record 3,565 million tonne-kilometers. There were two southern concessions, merged in 2000 to form Ferrosur. Ferrosur operates the line between Mexico City and the Gulf of Mexico port of Veracruz. In 2005, Ferrosur was bought by Ferromex's parent company. KCSM challenged the acquisition and the merger failed to receive regulatory approval. However, in March 2011, a tribunal ruled in Grupo Mexico's favor, and the merger was permitted. The three major Mexican railroads jointly own Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de M√©xico (Ferrovalle) which operates railroads and terminals in and around Mexico City. =High-speed rail= In 2006, the Secretariat of Communications and Transport of Mexico proposed a high-speed rail link that will transport its passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Jalisco, with stops in the cities of Quer√©taro, Guanajuato, Leon and Irapuato; and a connected line running from the port city of Manzanillo to Aguascalientes. The train would travel at 300 km/h, and would allow passengers to travel from Mexico City to Guadalajara in just 2 hours at an affordable price (the same trip by road would last 7 hours). The network would also be connected to Monterrey, Chilpancingo, Cuernavaca, Toluca, Puebla, Tijuana, Hermosillo, Cordoba, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Colima, Zacatecas, Torreon, Chihuahua, Puebla, San Luis Potosi, Mexicali, Saltillo, and Acapulco by 2015. The whole project was projected to cost 240 billion pesos, or about 25 billion dollars. Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim expressed an interest in investing in high- speed rail. =Revival of passenger service= Rail System in Mexico. President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto proposed a return to services of intercity trains, the proposed projects are Mexico City-Toluca (construction began July 7, 2014), the Peninsular train (Yucat√°n-Mayan Riviera), Mexico-Quer√©taro high speed train starts construction October 2014 and will operate speeds up to 300 km/h (with expansion to Guadalajara) and Puebla-Tlaxcala-Mexico City. On November 3, 2014, China Railways Construction Corporation associated with Prodemex, Teya and GHP has won the contract to build the high Speed train Mexico City-Quer√©taro. The estimated cost will be close to 4 billion dollars, to be finished by the end of 2017 and will be fully operational by spring 2018. However, Mexico canceled the contract four days later because of doubts over the bidding process. In 2015, Mexico opened a new tender, which was revoked again. Hence, Mexico could indemnify China Railway Construction Corporation $1.31m. President-elect Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador announced a US$7.4 billion plan to build a tourist and freight railway on the Yucat√°n Peninsula in September 2018. The project, named the Mayan Train, began construction in December 2018 and will connect Palenque to Canc√∫n, but remains controversial with environmentalists and indigenous rights activists.

After a couple of rehearsals, vocalist Sebastian kicked in and the first roster of the band was complete. Later, Anibal replaced Andres as the band's drummer. With this lineup, the band played for a couple of years, recording their first full-length album and touring around Colombia. After finishing the recording of their second album in 2000, Anibal left the band, and Johnie All Stars went through more drummers until finally breaking up in 2002. In 2004 they reunited to launch their second work with Koala Records, and settled on their current lineup. The band was born in Medell√≠n, Colombia, in 1997, forming what would be the first demonstration of the city's new punk- rock sound. The band, with a sound strongly influenced by the punk tendencies of California, sings powerful lyrics with strong words that talk about the everyday lives of the young punks and skateboarders of the '90s in the city. After several concerts sharing the stage with the most recognized bands of the city's punk-rock scene, they recorded their first album in 1998, titled ¬´S√≥lo quiero diversi√≥n¬ª (\\"I Only Want Fun\\"). This was the beginning of neo-punk in Medell√≠n. ¬´S√≥lo quiero diversi√≥n¬ª led the way for the city's other bands and strengthened the local scene that gave Medell√≠n recognition at the national level as the punk-rock city of Colombia. This same year, the band was featured at Rock al Parque (Rock at the Park), receiving the best comments thanks to their strength and the 110% effort they demonstrated at each show. After several more years of constant shows all over Colombia, sharing the stage with the country's various genres of rock bands, the band began writing and recording its second album. In 2004, ¬´Por honor¬ª (\\"For Honor\\") was released, with a rockier sound and their first widely successful song ¬´Creer¬ª (\\"Believe\\"), which was played continuously for two years. In 2005, they began the composition of their third album and released the song ¬´Rocanrol¬ª (\\"Rock and Roll\\"), which stayed at number 1 on Medell√≠n's radio for three consecutive weeks. After almost two years of composition and preproduction, and concerts with bands like 2 Minutos (2 Minutes) and H2O, in 2008 they finished the recording of ¬´Cinema Johnie¬ª. With this unprecedented album they made a strong return to the roots of rock 'n' roll and the band redefined Colombian punk- rock, as it had done from its beginnings over ten years before. entretenimiento.terra.com (Google translation) Retrieved 2016-5-20 Rockombia.com(Google translation) Retrieved 2016-5-20 Discography =Albums= * ¬´Solo quiero diversi√≥n¬ª (\\"I Only Want Fun\\"), 2000 (recorded in 1997) * ¬´Por honor¬ª (\\"For Honor\\"), 2002 (recorded in 2000) * ¬´Cinema Johnie¬ª, 2008 (recorded in 2008) =Compilations= * ¬´Mutante Vol. 1 (Esa chica)¬ª (\\"Mutant Vol. 1 (This Girl)\\"), 2004 * ¬´Tributo a la pestilencia (Soldado mutilado)¬ª (\\"Tribute to the Plague (Mutilated Soldier)\\"), 2009 References External links * purevolume Colombian punk rock groups Rock en Espa√±ol music groups Musical groups from Medell√≠n ","title":"Johnie All Stars"},{"id":"4306024","text":"The following are the football (soccer) events of the year 1923 throughout the world.

He is a frequent enemy of Thor and a somewhat reluctant ally of the Wrecker and the Wrecking Crew. Publication history Thunderball was created by Len Wein and Sal Buscema and first appeared in The Defenders #17 (November 1974). Phillip Lamarr Cunningham identifies how black supervillains are often forced to choose between great power and great intellect: \\"Thunderball, who despite his genius-level intellect relies primarily on his strength, has resorted to utilizing a ball and chain as a weapon, and commits crimes with his band of ruffians, The Wrecking Crew.\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=O8HOCwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA40#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Fictional character biography Dr. Eliot Franklin was born in Buffalo, New York. He became a brilliant physicist and engineer whose greatest claim to fame was inventing a miniature gamma-ray bomb, something that Dr. Robert Bruce Banner (better known as the Hulk) was unable to do at that time. Dr. Franklin was often called \\"the Black Bruce Banner\\" because of his genius-level intellect and his scientific knowledge in the field of gamma radiation. Franklin used his scientific genius in private employ and built a miniaturized gamma bomb for Richmond Enterprises. However, Richmond executive J. C. Pennysworth informed Franklin that under the terms of their contract, all intellectual concepts developed by Franklin (including the gamma bomb) were the property of Richmond and not his. Upset that he could not profit from his own genius, Franklin threw a fit and was fired by Pennysworth and escorted from the building. He later attempted to steal back his plans for the gamma bomb, but was caught and sent to prison. It was there that he first encountered Dirk Garthwaite (also known as the Wrecker, who was de-powered at that time), Henry Camp, and Brian Philip Calusky. One night during a thunderstorm, Garthwaite broke out of prison, along with his cellmates Henry Camp, Brian Philip Calusky, and Dr. Eliot Franklin. He recovered his magical crowbar and held it aloft, all four men placing their hands upon it. Lightning struck the crowbar, not only reactivating the enchantment but also empowering the other three men as well. The four felons dubbed themselves the Wrecking Crew; Camp became Bulldozer, Calusky became Piledriver, and Franklin became Thunderball. Soon after, Thunderball took an ordinary wrecking ball for an offensive weapon which was energized by the Wrecker's crowbar, making it almost indestructible. Thunderball then convinced his allies that they should capture the gamma bomb he had created and use it to ransom New York. They began to tear apart buildings owned by Richmond Enterprises to find the bomb, attracting the attention of the Defenders, including Nighthawk (Kyle Richmond himself). The Crew was defeated by the Defenders and dispersed to different prisons.Defenders #17-19 Thunderball later battled Captain America and Iron Fist alongside the Wrecking Crew while trying to lure Thor into battle.Iron Fist #11-12 Thunderball later battled Thor alongside the Wrecking Crew.Thor #304 He also battled the second Iron Man, James Rhodes.Iron Man #171 Thunderball was later taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld during the Secret Wars with the rest of the Wrecking Crew and various other criminals, where they were part of Doctor Doom's evil alliance, and battled heroes such as the Avengers, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four.Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars #1-12 The relationship between the Wrecker and Thunderball has always been somewhat strained at times. Dr. Franklin believes that he is superior to the Wrecker because he is smarter than the Wrecker is, thus causing him to be resentful that the source and total reliance of his power lies with the Wrecker. Thunderball has attempted to usurp the Wrecker's power many times, only to be eventually thwarted. Once, the Wrecker easily crushed Thunderball's hand after he tried to steal his crowbar. However, the Wrecker has always taken Thunderball back, because he considers Thunderball and the rest of the Wrecking Crew as the only family he truly has. On one occasion, the Wrecking Crew battled Spider-Man and Spider-Woman while attempting to acquire the means to blackmail the federal government. Thunderball and the Wrecker fought for control over the Norn power, and Thunderball succeeded in stealing the crowbar and added it to his own powers, but he was defeated by Spider-Man and Spider- Woman.Spectacular Spider-Man #125-126 As a member of the Wrecking Crew, Thunderball has faced many of Marvel's superheroes, including Thor, Iron Man, the Avengers, and the Hulk. They have also been part of other \\"Super Villain\\" organizations, but they always stayed together as a team. Thunderball has occasionally operated on his own, working as a scientist for criminal organizations. Thunderball joined the Masters of Evil alongside the rest of the Wrecking Crew, and took over Avengers Mansion. As part of this \\"Siege of Avengers Mansion\\", the Wrecking Crew, along with other Masters as Tiger Shark and Mister Hyde, beat a drunken Olympian demigod Hercules nearly to death. However, they were drained of their power by Thor in retaliation.Avengers #273-277 Thunderball was later protected from the Wrecker's vengeance by the Thing.Fantastic Four #355 Thunderball developed something of a soft spot for the employees of Damage Control, particularly account executive John Porter, after the firm helped him recover his lost wrecking ball (the weapon had been turned in to Damage Control's Lost and Found department).Damage Control #1 During a massive supervillain breakout at the prison called the Vault, the Wrecking Crew met up with a team from Damage Control led by Porter. To aid Porter without appearing to betray the Crew, Thunderball tricked his teammates into thinking John has superpowers (really, Thunderball hitting the Crew when the lights are out) and the Damage Control team manages to escape.Damage Control (vol. 2) #1 The Wrecking Crew battled the Avengers and Freedom Force during the breakout, and Thunderball battled Venom for leadership of the convicts. Ultimately, Thunderball helped Iron Man and Dr. Hank Pym disarm a bomb that would have destroyed the Vault.The Vault Graphic Novel The Wrecking Crew were broken out of prison and used by a group of villains during the Acts of Vengeance storyline. Thunderball was sent by Doctor Doom to help a group of villains assembled to defeat the Fantastic Four, although the villains were all defeated.Fantastic Four #335 With the Wrecking Crew, Thunderball freed the Wrecker and Ulik from police custody. They battled Hercules and Thor and then battled Thor, Excalibur and Code: Blue.Thor #418, 426-428 Thunderball was freed from police custody by Jeff Wilde. Thunderball joined forces with the Secret Empire, creating many of the weapons systems that would be used to turn Jeff Wilde, son of the original Midnight Man, into the cyborg warrior known as Midnight. In a battle with the Empire against Spider-Man, the Moon Knight, and their allies Darkhawk, the Punisher, Nova, and Night Thrasher, Thunderball was one of the few Empire operatives to survive the destruction of the organization's base. He surrendered to the assembled heroes soon after.Amazing Spider-Man #353-358 The Wrecking Crew with Thunderball once conquered an entire planet together, Polemachus, which was the home of sometime Avenger ally/adversary Arkon. They overthrew Arkon and his consort, Thundra, and ruled Polemachus with the help of Arkon's former Grand Vizier, who betrayed them. This was after they briefly lost their Asgardian powers (when Loki took the power originally meant for him from the Wrecker) and obtained their powers from a totally different energy source. Part of that energy source was Monica Rambeau herself, also known as the Avenger Pulsar (at the time, her codename was Photon). During a battle in London, Thunderball tries to kill a wounded Captain America. Kelsey Leigh saves him using the shield, but dies due to the shock of the impacts. Kelsey later returns as a new Captain Britain and seemingly kills Thunderball, but he survives. It is, however, revealed that this Thunderball is either Mordred, the ally of Morgana le Fay, or Franklin possessed by him. Later, the Wrecking Crew breaks into a bank in Los Angeles, where they are confronted by the Runaways, who defeat them. Thunderball gets chewed on by one of the team, Old Lace, a dinosaur from the future. Thunderball and the rest of the Wrecking Crew are forced into governmental service under the Thunderbolts program. The Wrecking Crew with Thunderball have since been spotted in Canada fighting the newly created Omega Flight.Omega Flight #1-5 The Hood hired Thunderball and the rest of the Wrecking Crew as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helps them fight the New Avengers, but is taken down by Doctor Strange. Thunderball was later seen with the Hood watching the Skrull invasion on TV,Secret Invasion #4 helping to ferret out Skrull infiltrators from their own ranks The New Avengers #46 and assisting in the Hood/hero alliance battle against invading Skrulls in Central Park. He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the Dark Avengers instead.New Avengers #50 During the Siege storyline, Thunderball rebelled against his teammates' attitude, stating that looting Asgard was blasphemy. He was knocked out by the rest of the Wrecking Crew before they were eventually defeated by the Young Avengers.Siege: Young Avengers #1 Following the Death of Wolverine storyline in the pages of Wolverine, the Wrecking Crew hired out to Mister Sinister to recover the remains of Wolverine and encountered Mystique's team.Wolverines #1 As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, Thunderball appears as a member of the Hood's incarnation of the Illuminati.Illuminati #1 Titania asks about the rest of the Wrecking Crew and he replies \\"I ditched 'em. I needed a change and the Hood offered it.\\"Illuminati #2 During the \\"Search for Tony Stark\\" story arc, Thunderball and the rest of the Wrecking Crew rejoin the Hood's gang as they attack Castle Doom. Thunderball and the Wrecker are defeated by Doctor Doom in his Iron Man armor.Invincible Iron Man #597 Powers and abilities Thunderball possesses superhuman strength and a high degree of imperviousness to harm thanks to the Asgardian magic imparted by the Wrecker's crowbar. He can withstand high amounts of concussive force and is virtually bulletproof. Thunderball's power augmented his entire body, strengthening his bones, muscles and flesh. His superhuman abilities are currently four times greater than when he originally shared the Wrecker's power, making him somewhat stronger than an average well- trained Asgardian god.Damage Control (vol. 2) #1 (1989) Thunderball possesses a virtually indestructible wrecking ball attached to a chain, enchanted by the Wrecker's crowbar. The wrecking ball, when thrown, is capable of returning to Thunderball in a similar fashion as the Wrecker's crowbar and Thor's hammer. With effort, Thunderball can even control the path it takes on its return. Thunderball can spin the wrecking ball on its chain fast enough to deflect bullets and automatic gunfire. By slamming the wrecking ball on the ground, Thunderball can cause minor localized quakes, knocking his opponents off- balance. The wrecking ball is also durable enough to be thrown into vehicles, buildings, and other structures, knocking them down with no damage to itself. In the past, the Hulk and Hercules have both destroyed the wrecking ball. When this happens, Thunderball does not suffer any ill psychic effects from the wrecking ball's destruction. He can recreate the weapon by obtaining a new wrecking ball and having the Wrecker enchant it for him. In addition, Thunderball is highly intelligent. He is a scientific genius in the field of engineering and physics, specializing in gamma radiation. He is a gifted physicist with a Ph.D. in physics as well as an experienced planner and tactician. On at least one occasion when he did not have access to the Wrecker's crowbar, he used his own engineering abilities to create an energized exoskeleton of power armor that simulated the abilities of the wrecking ball, albeit on a lesser scale. The exoskeleton also gave Franklin the ability to shock foes on physical contact. He also engineered an energized wrecking ball capable of projecting electrical energy bolts.

The walk starts in the Piazza San Marco, in front of the Doge's Palace. Walkers follow a route characteristic of the city, which leads them through calli (streets), campi (squares) and ponti (bridges). The Su e Zo is also known as Solidarity Walk (it. passeggiata di solidariet√†) because the revenues of the event go to charitable projects. Different routes are laid out for various age groups: the main circuit runs over 47 bridges and is 12 km long whereas a shorter route is 7 km long and crosses 27 bridges. Beverage is provided by the organisators along the track. About 400-600 volunteers help with the organisation and implementation of the event, which is visited by about 10 to 12,000 participants every year. The event is managed by the TGS Eurogroup (Turismo Giovanile Sociale, it. Social Youth Tourism), a non-profit organisation founded by a Salesian of Don Bosco, Dino Berti, who has started the Su e Zo walk in 1975. Walkers receive a commemorative medal on completing the event, groups from a given size up will receive a larger badge. There are special prices for schools in different categories and special groups. After the award ceremony other festivities follow such as a performance of flag-wavers and folklore groups. The revenues from starting fees are donated to charity projects, often in developing countries such as Peru, Brasil, Syria, Etopia, Haiti or the eathquake affected town of L'Aquila.

He was Chaplain-in-Ordinary to Charles I. Life Ross was born in Aberdeen, and entered King's College, Aberdeen after completing his studies at Aberdeen Grammar School, in 1604. About 1616 he succeeded Thomas Parker in the mastership of the free school at Southampton, an appointment which he owed to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford. By 1622 he had been appointed, through William Laud's influence, one of Charles I's chaplains, and in that year appeared The First and Second Book of Questions and Answers upon the Book of Genesis, by Alexander Ross of Aberdeen, preacher at St. Mary's, near Southampton, and one of his Majesty's Chaplains. He was vicar of St. Mary's Church, Carisbrooke in the Isle of Wight from 1634 to his death; he left Southampton in 1642. In Pansebeia, Ross gave a list of his books, past and to come. He died in 1654 at Bramshill House in Hampshire, where he was living with Sir Andrew Henley, and in the neighbouring Eversley church there are two tablets to his memory. Ross left many legacies, and his books were left to his friend Henley, an executor and guardian to a nephew, William Ross. Alexander Ross, 1648 engraving by William Faithorne. Among Ross's friends and patrons were Lewis Watson, 1st Baron Rockingham, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet, Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, and John Evelyn. His correspondence with Henry Oxenden, in English and Latin, is in the British Museum. He is not the Alexander Ross of the Aberdeen doctors, who remained in Scotland and died in 1639. Works Richard Westfall calls him \\"the vigilant watchdog of conservatism and orthodoxy\\".Richard S. Westfall, Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England (1973), p. 33. He was concerned to defend Aristotle and repel the Copernican theory, as it gained ground. In 1634 he published a work on the immobility of the earth, attacking Nathanael Carpenter and Philip Landsberg.John L. Russell, The Copernican System in Great Britain, p. 230 in Jerzy Dobrzycki (editor), The reception of Copernicus' heliocentric theory (1973). He became involved in a debate with John Wilkins and Libert Froidmond, around the beliefs of Christopher Clavius.James M.

He attacked Thomas Browne (defending, for instance, the beliefs that crystal is a sort of fossilized ice, and that garlic hinders magnetism), and many other contemporary ideas. In other controversies he took on Sir Kenelm Digby, Thomas Hobbes, and William Harvey. In his 1734 translation of the Qur'an, George Sale attributes to Alexander Ross the translation into English of Andr√© du Ryer's 1647 French translation of the Qur'an.George Sale, The Koran (London: Tegg, 1877), p.vii This attribution is, most probably, spurious. Furthermore, Sale is most critical of the quality of both the Arabic-French translation work as well as the French-English translation work.

It is used by athletes in cross-training for sports, by weight-trainers as a fitness exercise, and by practitioners of yoga as part of an asana regimen. In contrast to the Split squat exercise, during the lunge the rear leg is also activated.http://www.livestrong.com/article/541710-what- is-the-difference-between-a-lunge-a-split-squat/ Strength training Lunges are a good exercise for strengthening, sculpting and building several muscles/muscle groups, including the quadriceps (or thighs), the gluteus maximus (or buttocks) as well as the hamstrings.http://www.musclemagfitness.com/bodybuilding/exercises/lunges.html A long lunge emphasizes the use of the gluteals whereas a short lunge emphasizes the quadriceps. The lunge is a basic movement that is fairly simple to do for beginner athletes. Overhead Kettlebell Lunge and Twist A lunge can be performed using bodyweight alone. However, weight trainers may seek to increase the difficulty using either dumbbells or kettlebells held in each hand, or a barbell held atop the neck and shoulders. Grip strength may be an issue with the dumbbell lunge so practitioners may prefer the barbell lunge. As a variation, plyometric lunges (also known as split squat jumps) can be performed by jumping explosively between lunge positions. With resistance training it's not recommended to do forward lunges in place, this is due to the shear force it can place on the rear knee once the front leg no longer provides support. Yoga Ashwa Sanchalanasana, equestrian pose, in modern yoga Modern yoga includes several lunge-related asanas such as the Virabhadrasana warrior poses I and II, and others whose names vary in different yoga traditions. Examples of Sanskrit names include Anjaneyasana (Anjaneya's pose), Ashwa Sanchalanasana (equestrian pose), and Ardha Mandalasana (half circle pose). Depending on the lineage and circumstances, the back knee can be down or up, the toes may be tucked or untucked, and the arms may be in any number of positions. Lunges are often incorporated into Surya Namaskar, a flowing sequence of asanas used as a warm-up and in vinyasa styles of yoga to connect asanas into aerobic exercise sequences.

Early life and family Thompson was born Flora Jane Timms in Juniper Hill in northeast Oxfordshire, the eldest child of Albert and Emma Timms, a stonemason and nursemaid respectively. Albert and Emma had twelve children, but only six survived childhood.Census Returns of England and Wales, 1911. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK, Class: RG14; Piece: 8177; Schedule Number: 134. One of her younger sisters was Betty Timms, best known for her children's book The Little Grey Men of the Moor. The young Flora's early education was at the parish school in the village of Cottisford where she was described as 'altogether her father's child'.Timms, Betty, More Tales from Lark Rise, The Wychwood Press, Charlbury 2012; . In 1891, at the age of 14, Flora moved to take up a position as counter clerk at the post office in Fringford, a village about northeast of Bicester, under the tutelage of the postmistress, Mrs Kezia Whitton.Lindsay, 2007, page not citedUnited Kingdom Census 1881, parish of Fringford She later served at various other post offices, including offices at Grayshott, Yateley, and Bournemouth. In 1903 she married John William Thompson, a post office clerk and telegraphist from the Isle of Wight, at Twickenham Parish Church, after which they moved to Bournemouth where they had a daughter, Winifred Grace (1903), and a son, Henry Basil (1909).Profile, cwgc.org; accessed 18 February 2016. In 1916 they moved to Liphook where their second son Peter Redmond was born (1918). Thompson's favourite brother, Edwin, was killed near Ypres in 1916. Literary output A self-taught and a largely self-educated writer, Thompson was thinking, as early as 1922, about writing of her childhood.Lindsay, Gillian The Story of the Lark Rise Writer Robert Hale Ltd, 1990; In 1911 she had won an essay competition in The Ladies Companion for a 300-word essay about Jane Austen.Winton Community Forum: Flora Thompson Her younger sister, Ethel Elizabeth 'Betty' Timms shared her love of writing, and Betty's success with a children's book, 'The Little Grey Men of the Moor', published in 1926, encouraged Flora to write her books. She later wrote extensively, publishing short stories and magazine and newspaper articles. She was also a keen self-taught naturalist; many of her nature articles were anthologised in 1986. In 1938 Thompson sent some essays on her country childhood to Oxford University Press. They were accepted and published in three separate volumes, Lark Rise (1939), Over to Candleford (1941), and Candleford Green (1943). In 1945 the books were republished as a trilogy under the title Lark Rise to Candleford. The trilogy is a lightly disguised story of the author's own youth, describing life in a hamlet, a village, and a country town in the 1880s. Two of Thompson's later lesser-known works were published posthumously: Heatherley, recounting her time in the post office at Grayshott at the turn of the 20th century when several of her lifelong interests took shape, the longing for education and culture and the desire to become a writer;Introduction, The Peverel Papers - A yearbook of the countryside ed. Julian Shuckburgh, Century Hutchinson London 1986 and her last book Still Glides the Stream.  Critical reception  H. J. Massingham said of Thompson in 1944, \\"...she possesses the attributes both of sympathetic presentation and literary power to such a degree that her claims can hardly be questioned\\".Massingham H.J. (1944), Lark Rise to Candleford, Penguin Books, London 1973, Thompson's essays have been said to reveal an impressive knowledge of English literature and a gift for writing intelligent but accessible prose for a general audience. She approached novel writing as an artistic process and her descriptions of nature are notably poetic.Hoffman, Ruth Collette. Without Education or Encouragement - The Literary Legacy of Flora Thompson, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, Madison, 2009; Thompson's biographer, Gillian Lindsay, says, \\"...this girl whose elementary education was not enough to allow her to take a Civil Service examination, had written a classic book, a piece of enduring literature,\\"Lindsay, Gillian The Story of the Lark Rise Writer - Robert Hale Ltd, 1990 while Shuckburgh considers that it was her 'passion and control' that made Thompson such a good writer. Her entry in the ODNB says of the trilogy that \\"Few works better or more elegantly capture the decay of Victorian agrarian England\\". Thompson's trilogy has been widely used as a primary source for the social history of the period, although some historians have expressed reservations as to its validity for that purpose. Death The death of Thompson's younger son during the Second World War affected her deeply and overshadowed her final years. She died in 1947 of a heart attack in Brixham, and is buried at Longcross Cemetery, Dartmouth, Devon.

It marked the directorial debut of Sen, who had until then been known as a leading actress of Bengali cinema. The film was very well received upon release. It stars Jennifer Kendal in a critically acclaimed role, along with Dhritiman Chatterjee and Debashree Roy. Plot In post-independence India an Anglo-Indian teacher, Violet Stoneham (Jennifer Kendal), lives a quiet and uneventful life at 36 Chowringhee Lane in Calcutta, now Kolkata. Her brother Eddie (Geoffrey Kendal, Jennifer's father in real life) is senile and ailing in a nursing home. After the marriage of her niece Rosemary (Soni Razdan), she is alone except for her cat, Sir Toby. Her only joy in life is teaching Shakespeare, despite the lack of interest from her students. Returning home from church on a Christmas Day, Violet runs into a former student, Nandita (Debashree Roy), and her author-boyfriend Samaresh (Dhritiman Chatterjee), and invites them over for coffee. They accept her invitation after some initial hesitation. However, they quickly realize that Violet's apartment would be convenient for their t√™te-√†-t√™tes while she is away at work. When Samaresh requests the use of Violet's apartment during school hours, saying that he would like to work on his novel, she agrees. For some time, this arrangement works to the benefit of all. Samaresh and Nandita get the privacy they desperately seek, and Violet has company when she returns home from work. Over time, she grows very fond of them, and begins to look upon them as her friends. Her old friends die or go away, she isn't appreciated at her job, and they are the only friends she has ‚Äì the only people who can make her laugh. Eventually Samaresh and Nandita get married, and move on with their lives. Violet wants to meet them on Christmas Day, and bake them a cake. They have a party organized at home, however, and think she would be 'a fish out of water' if invited. So they lie about not being in town during Christmas. Violet comes over, any way, to drop off the cake on Christmas Day, and finally sees that she has been deceived by them. She walks home to her lonely life, slowly. The final scene of the film shows Violet reciting aloud from King Lear, with her only audience being a stray dog.

When she showed it to Satyajit Ray, he suggested she make the film. He also suggested Shashi Kapoor as the producer. After approaching several producers and repeatedly being asked what she was trying to sell, she finally sent a synopsis of the plot to Kapoor. He liked it and asked her to come over to Mumbai, and the film took off from there. Aparna Sen had not thought of Jennifer Kendal to play the lead. She was looking for someone older, perhaps someone who was actually an Anglo-Indian. She was persuaded by Utpal Dutt to cast Kendal, who herself suggested the look of Violet Stoneham with her hair in a bun. Shooting Originally, Sen had thought of Govind Nihalani to shoot the film. However, he was not free, and she would have to wait a year to begin work on the film. Kapoor suggested the names of several other cinematographers. Sen saw a film shot by Ashok Mehta, and decided she wanted him for her film. The film was shot in almost a namesake address of 26, Chowringhee Road with a beautiful view of the Indian Museum and the Maidan along with its landmarks like the Eden Gardens, the High Court, Governor's House, the Shaheed Minar and Fort William. The depiction of pre-marital sex in the film was ahead of its time. About the intimate scenes in the film, Sen said: \\"I feel scenes of sexual intimacy are ruined if the director is embarrassed. I wasn't embarrassed. There was nothing in it that I thought was obscene.\\" Post-production At the post-production stage, Debashree Roy's voice was dubbed over with Sen's own voice. Sen explained that this was done partly in order to save time. Moreover, Dhritiman Chatterjee was a good deal older than Roy, and she wanted a voice that was slightly older. The art direction of the film was done by Bansi Chandragupta, who is well known as the art director of the Apu Trilogy and other Ray films. In June 1981, when the film was in the final stages of post-production, Chandragupta died of a heart attack. The film is dedicated to him. Reception When initially released, the film was appreciated by a niche audience but did not do well commercially. Describing it as a \\"total loss\\", Shashi Kapoor lamented that at places he had to hire the theatres himself to exhibit it. Critically, however, the film was very well received. It won the Best Direction award for Sen at the National film awards. Ashok Mehta's camera work was much appreciated. 36 Chowringhee Lane was also entered in the first edition of the Manila International Film Festival, where it won the top prize. Jennifer Kendal's performance as Violet Stoneham remains a talking-point to this day. Scholar Wimal Dissanayake sees the film as a portrayal of the patriarchal social system: \\"The film portrays the plight of a lonely woman in a society that cares little for questions of female subjectivity and self-fulfillment.\\" Legacy Indian films made in English (see also English-language Indian films) Prior to 36 Chowringhee Lane, film makers in India did not consider English to be a viable choice of language for feature films. After it, there has been a thin but steady stream of such films, including Sen's Mr. and Mrs. Iyer and 15 Park Avenue. =In popular culture= The title of the film has become symbolic of the city of Kolkata, particularly its cuisine. A Bangalore restaurant is called 36 Chowringhee Lane. A fast-food chain in Delhi is called 34 Chowringhee Lane.

May 1910 N de M absorbed the Mexican Central Railroad (Ferrocarril Central Mexicano, first section from Mexico City to Le√≥n, Guanajuato, opened in 1882) in 1909, thus acquiring a second border gateway at Ciudad Ju√°rez (adjacent to El Paso, Texas). The N de M was nationalized by President L√°zaro C√°rdenas del R√≠o in 1938, and privatized 60 years later by President Ernesto Zedillo. N de M operated most railway trackage through the central and northeastern regions of the republic. The Ferrocarril del Pac√≠fico (or Pacific Railroad) and the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pac√≠fico operated railroads in the northwest. In 1995, the Mexican government announced that the FNM would be privatized and divided into four main systems. As part of the restructuring for privatization, FNM suspended passenger rail service in 1997, and the new arrangements applied from 1998. The companies were Kansas City Southern de Mexico, Ferromex, Ferrosur, and (owned jointly by the three companies) Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de M√©xico or Ferrovalle which operates railroads and terminals in and around Mexico City. It was until June 4, 2001 during Vicente Fox Presidency, where FNM was officially extinguished, after a publication in Mexican Official's Gazette. FNM juridic representation will be kept only until liquidation process has been finished. As of 2006, the remaining parts of NdeM are in the process of liquidation. =Locomotives= N de M ALCO C424 8129 leads a train in Esperanza in 1966 During the days of steam locomotives, N de M was best known for operating Ni√°gara class locomotives, which took their name from the New York Central Railroad locomotives of the same wheel configuration. It was also the home of several narrow gauge systems that used steam, both nationally and regionally. N de M was one of the few railroads outside the US to purchase new diesel locomotives from Baldwin Locomotive Works: the only three \\"Baldwin E-units\\" ever built (\\"0660 1000/2 DE\\"), the DR-12-8-1500/2 \\"Centipede\\" and the AS-616. Two of the three 0660 1000/2 DE locomotives had been on major railroads in the United States on a demonstration tour in 1945. N de M bought them and ordered a third in 1946. All three consistently broke down and were retired soon after their factory warranties expired. They do not appear on the 1950 N de M locomotive roster, and sat for years in the scrapyard at San Luis Potos√≠. Notes in the FNM archives in Puebla, Mexico describe how one of these locomotives had a wheel disintegrate at high speed, and also how the Centipede locomotives were delivered in 1948 with parts missing. In Ac√°mbaro, Guanajuato, N de M operated one of the few facilities in Latin America that was capable of constructing and doing complete rebuilds of steam locomotives, thus with rare exceptions (as with the Niagaras), most of N de M steam motive power was purchased used and rebuilt there. Portions of the facility and a preserved 2-8-0 steam locomotive remain as part of Acambaro's municipal railway museum.Museo Local de Ac√°mbaro Dr. Luis Mota Maciel Notable named passenger trains of the N de M  Named trains usually bore names related to the destination, for example, El Pur√©pecha referred to the Pur√©pecha peoples of western Michoac√°n. *El Jarocho - Mexico City - Veracruz, Veracruz. *√Åguila Azteca - Mexico City - Monterrey - Nuevo Laredo, with the addition name, the Texas Eagle for continued service to San Antonio and St. Louis and connections to Amtrak for continued service to Chicago *El Azteca - Mexico City - El Paso, Texas *La Estrella del Sur - Mexico City - Puebla - Oaxaca *El Regiomontano - Mexico City - Monterrey - Nuevo Laredo *El Fronterizo - El Paso, Texas - Ciudad Ju√°rez - Chihuahua - Mexico City; as #7/8, it had connections to Southern Pacific Railroad connections to Los Angeles *El Nocturno - Mexico City - Uruapan *El Oaxaque√±o - Mexico City - Puebla - Oaxaca *El Pur√©pecha - Mexico City - Morelia - Uruapan - L√°zaro C√°rdenas (Michoac√°n) *El Tapat√≠o - Mexico City - Guadalajara *El R√°pido de la Frontera (railcar service) Chihuahua - Ciudad Ju√°rez - with nearby connections to the north in El Paso *El Hidalguense - Mexico City - Pachuca, Hidalgo The √Åguila Azteca/Texas Eagle service was in conjunction with the Missouri Pacific railroad, and later with Amtrak.

There were connections to Guatemala in Ciudad Hidalgo. Other passenger service was provided between Mexico City and: Cuernavaca, Morelos; Tampico, Tamaulipas; and Guanajuato, Guanajuato Buenavista railway station in Mexico City has been renovated and is now the southern end of the new electric Tren Suburbano line.

The film is based on Walter Mosley's novel of the same name and features Denzel Washington, Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Beals, and Don Cheadle.. In the summer of 1948, World War II veteran Ezekiel \\"Easy\\" Rawlins is in need of a job, and becomes drawn into the search for a mysterious woman. The film received generally positive reviews, with many praising Cheadle's scene-stealing performance but was a box office bomb grossing just $17.1 million against a budget of $27 million. Plot In 1948 Los Angeles, Easy Rawlins is laid off from his job at Champion Aircraft, and needs money to pay his mortgage. Easy's friend Joppy introduces him to DeWitt Albright, a white man looking for a missing white woman, Daphne Monet. Explaining that Monet's disappearance led her wealthy fianc√©, Todd Carter, to drop out of the Los Angeles mayoral race, Albright pays Easy $100 ($ today) to find Daphne, who is known to frequent the juke joints along Central Avenue. Easy begins his search at an illegal club, where he sees the bouncer, Junior Fornay, eject a white man. Learning that his friend Dupree Brouchard's girlfriend, Coretta James, is a confidant of Daphne, Easy spends the night with Coretta and discovers Daphne is involved with gangster Frank Green. Albright arranges a meeting at the Malibu pier, where Easy is accosted by white youths, before Albright viciously humiliates one of the boys at gunpoint. Easy tells him about Green, and is given another payment to continue his search. Returning home, Easy is arrested by LAPD homicide detectives, who reveal that Coretta has been murdered. Interrogated and beaten before being released, he is approached by Matthew Terell, the remaining mayoral candidate. Terell is with a young boy, supposedly his adopted son, and inquires about Daphne, but Easy divulges nothing. After a nightmare about Coretta, he receives a call from Daphne herself. They meet at the Ambassador Hotel, and she asks him to drive her to meet a man named Richard McGee. Arriving to find McGee ‚Äì the white man from the club ‚Äì dead, and his house ransacked, Easy notices a pack of Mexican cigarettes while Daphne flees. At home, Easy is threatened by Albright and his goons to track Daphne down again. Easy sends for his friend, Raymond 'Mouse' Alexander, and confronts Joppy for leading Daphne to him. He meets with Todd Carter, realizing that Albright actually works for Terell, and secures another payment to locate Daphne. Returning home, he is ambushed by Frank Green but rescued by Mouse. Frank escapes after the trigger-happy Mouse shoots him in the shoulder, and Easy misses a call from Daphne. Questioned again by the detectives, Easy is given until the following morning to clear his name. Easy and Mouse confront Junior ‚Äì the owner of the cigarettes ‚Äì who admits to driving McGee home and being given a letter for Coretta to deliver to Daphne. They visit Dupree; inside Coretta's Bible, Easy finds the contents of the letter: incriminating photographs of Terell with naked children. At home, Easy finds Daphne waiting, and she reveals that Frank is her half-brother: their mother was Creole, and Daphne's father was white, while Frank's was black. Terell learned of Daphne's heritage, and the potential scandal forced Carter to abandon his campaign, but Daphne bought the pictures from McGee to blackmail Terell into silence. Hunting for Daphne and the pictures, Albright murdered McGee. When Coretta threatened to sell the pictures to Terell, Daphne sent Joppy to intimidate her, but did not expect him to kill Coretta. Albright and his men arrive, subduing Easy and kidnapping Daphne. Joined by Mouse, Easy abducts Joppy at gunpoint, forcing him to take them to Albright's cabin in the Hollywood Hills. Easy and Mouse kill Albright and his men and rescue Daphne; returning to the car, Easy learns Mouse killed Joppy. Daphne pays Easy and Mouse $7,000 for the pictures, and Mouse returns home to Houston with his share. Daphne reveals that Carter's family paid her $30,000 to leave town, but she believes that the pictures will ensure Carter's victory and their marriage. Driving Daphne to meet Carter, who rejects her, Easy receives the rest of his payment in exchange for the pictures. Daphne and her brother leave town, while Carter's election is assured. No longer in trouble with the police, Easy considers starting his own business as a private investigator.

Franklin thought the work was more than a detective story; he said that Mosley was able to transform an everyday guy into a detective. In the editing process, Franklin had to cut a steamy love scene between Beals and Washington because he believed the scene was not needed to convey the story.Tornquist, Cynthia. CNN, \\"Showbiz Tonight\\", September 28, 1995. =Locations= The film was shot mostly in Los Angeles, California. The pier shot where Easy Rawlins gets in trouble with local youths was filmed at the Malibu, California pier. Other locales in Los Angeles include the Griffith Park Observatory and the famed Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard.

On Metacritic the film has a score of 78 out of 100, based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on scale of A to F. In a positive film review, critic James Berardinelli discussed Devil in a Blue Dress from a sociological viewpoint, especially one involving the 1990s. He concludes, 'The most interesting element of Devil in a Blue Dress is not the whodunit, but the 'whydunit.' Finding the guilty parties isn't as involving as learning their motivation, which is buried in society's perception of racial interaction. By uncovering the truth behind this mystery, Franklin illustrates that some attitudes have indeed changed for the better over the last forty years.'Berardinelli, James. Reel Views, 1995. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, did not like the story much but did like the look and tone of the film, and wrote: 'I liked the movie without quite being caught up in it: I liked the period, tone and look more than the story, which I never really cared much about.

Kenneth Turan, film critic for the Los Angeles Times and NPR, liked the film, and wrote: 'Hard-boiled fiction is a been-around genre about done-that individuals, so the pleasant air of newness and excitement that Devil in a Blue Dress gives off isn't due to its familiar find-the-girl plot. Rather it's the film's glowing visual qualities, a striking performance by Denzel Washington and the elegant control Carl Franklin has over it all that create the most exotic crime entertainment of the season.\\"Turan, Kenneth .

Chong-kwai's mother, who is an expert on the supernatural, warns the friends to leave Thailand but April stays behind because she wants to find Kofei (her boyfriend). One night, April tries one of the methods and brushes her hair in front of a mirror at night. Her fate is uncertain. Back in Hong Kong, Ted and May continue to experience strange and ghostly encounters, with Ted being possessed by a ghost at one point. In Thailand, Chong-kwai sees that the drawings of characters in the book have been replaced by images of himself and his friends.

Prior to 1909, it was known as the Rio Grande, Sierra Madre & Pacific Railway. It was built with mostly Canadian capitalhttps://dspace.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/22194 in order to reach logging and mining operations. Its subsidiary operation, the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, extended into the US at El Paso, Texas. In 1954 the railway was merged into the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico and the El Paso Southern sold to the Southern Pacific railroad. During the latter years of operation (1947-1954), the railway was controlled by tunnel magnate \\"Subway Sam\\" Rosoff, who also controlled large lumber interests along the route. Due to the amount of mining activity on this line, its trains were occasionally victims of holdup attempts, most notably by Mexican Revolutionary Pancho Villa, who in 1913 raided a train carrying silver and successfully held a Wells Fargo employee for ransom. In January 1916, raiders associated with Villa stopped an MNW train and massacred 18 American employees of the ASARCO company. During the Punitive Expedition led by U.S. General John J. Pershing in 1916 to attempt to capture Pancho Villa, use of the railway for transporting supplies was a point of contention between the US expedition and the provisional Mexican government of Venustiano Carranza. US troops employed \\"truck trains\\" to supply troops due to Carranza's refusal to allow the Americans use of the rail line.

In all three modes, both players must line up blocks of a particular colour - and when three blocks have been lined up (vertically), they will crack.

At the end of the \\"Mystic Ocean\\", the player has to defeat a sea demon named Jamir, by cracking the block he is possessing with his face; he will then go on to possess a different block, and once the blocks he possesses have been cracked six times, he will be defeated. However, the game is not over at this point - as there is still one more stage that has to be cleared (called the \\"Escape Stage\\"), where the player must get seven pink dolphins and one blue one (which appear as part of the block groups) down to the bottom of the screen. Once it has been cleared, the player shall receive a \\"Clear Bonus\\" of 100000 points, an \\"Item Bonus\\" of up to 400000 points, and a \\"Level Bonus\\" of up to 430000 points (it will be reset if the player chooses to continue); it is only then that the game will end.

He is best known for his appearances with the professional wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling under the ring name King Kong in the early 1990s and later worked as Krusher Kong on the wrestling independent circuit. Thompson teamed up with another wrestler, Dwain McCullough, known as Awesome Kong to form a regular tag team known as The Colossal Kongs. Professional wrestling career Thompson made his professional wrestling debut on the independent circuit in 1989 working under the ring name Big Hoss Mcalister. Initially he worked for a promotion called World Wrestling Association (WWA) based in New Jersey. In the WWA he formed a tag team with Chief Thunder Mountain and together they became the first holders of the WWA Tag Team Championship in early 1989. On October 21, 1989 they lost the championship to a team called The Motor City Madmen (Al The Sledgehammer & Mike Moore), but regained it on May 5, 1990. The team's second and final run as the WWA Tag Team Champions ended on May 25, 1991 as they were defeated by a team known as \\"The Lords of Darkness\\" (Agony and Pain). Thompson had returned briefly to the WWA to drop the titles after having competed in Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) for several months prior. In AJPW he worked as \\"Texas Terminator Hoss\\" or some times just \\"Texas Terminator\\" and competed in the 1991 Champion Carnival tournament. During the tournament he only earned 2 points by defeating Johnny Ace while losing to Doug Furnas, Stan Hansen, Kenta Kobashi, Dynamite Kid and Mitsuharu Misawa. In 1992, Thompson began working for the Memphis, Tennessee-based United States Wrestling Association (USWA). In the USWA he was known as \\"Meat\\", teamed up with another wrestler known as \\"Potatoes\\" to for a team called \\"The Fat Boys\\". At USWA's Night of Champions the duo defeated Tony Falk and Jim Steele in the lone highlight for the team. While in the USWA Thompson became friends with a wrestler known as \\"The Awesome Kong\\" and the two decided to form a tag team. Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \\"King Kong\\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \\"The Colossal Kongs\\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \\"randomly drawn\\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \\"Krusher Kong\\" instead of the more generic \\"King Kong\\".

It was the final game to be developed and published by Atari themselves before dropping support for the platform and merging with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on July 30th, 1996, and the last fighting title released for the console. Set in a purgatory dimension known as the Specter Zone, Fight for Life follows eight deceased fighters as they enter a tournament held by a morphological being called the Gatekeeper, who will bestow a second chance at life to the winning victor. Its gameplay consists of one-on-one fights, with a main eight-button configuration, featuring special moves and the ability to customize character's movesets, as well as four different playable modes. Directed, designed and solely programmed by former Sega AM2 member Francois Yves Bertrand as Atari's answer to Virtua Fighter, Fight for Life started development in the second quarter of 1994 and had a troubled development cycle, undergoing through various changes before its late release on the system. Fight for Life was met with negative reviews; while some praised the ability to customize the characters with stolen movesets from fighters, the slow pace and controls were widely seen as crippling flaws. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Kimura and Jenny. Fight for Life is a polygon-based fighting game similar to Virtua Fighter and Tekken, in which the player fights against opponents in one-on-one matches. The fighter who manages to deplete the health bar of the opponent wins the bout and the first to win two bouts in a best-of-3 match becomes the winner. Rounds are not timed. Similarly to Battle Arena Toshinden, characters can maneuver in the 3D environments by sidestepping to avoid upcoming attacks, allowing them to move around in a counter-clockwise direction while still facing their opponent. Health bars are also not displayed during gameplay, instead, they are only shown once any of the characters have taken damage. Unlike most fighting games of the time, players begin with very few special moves and by defeating opponents, they can \\"steal\\" two special moves from them and build their unique fighter. The game features four modes of play and two types of camera movement, in addition to supporting both the Jaguar's ProController and standard gamepad.Fight for Life game manual (Atari Jaguar, US) In the easiest mode, players do not fight against the final boss. Synopsis =Plot= The Specter Zone is a purgatory dimension set between heaven and hell, which is overseen by a shape-shifting being only known as the Gatekeeper, who forms a tournament for his own amusement and will bestow a second chance at life to any of the eight deceased fighters, all of which died in 1995. =Characters= *Kimura: The son of a noble Japanese family, he was trained in the art of ninjitsu at the age of 4 by his father and remained undefeated until his death. *Ian: The drifting son of a streetwalker, he was an active soldier before he went missing in action during an operation. *Kara: A housewife who became obsessed with fighting against a shape-shifting being before getting committed to a psychiatric hospital and throwing herself from the top-floor of the building. *Pog: An orphan who gained a reputation when working on docks before their closure and later being gunned down on a sidewalk. *Mr. G: A professional boxer who lost a title match before being beaten to death by gangsters at a bar. *Muhali: a Bedouin who was poisoned by one of his wives out of jealousy. *Jenny: A travelling tomboy martial arts expert who was killed by surface-to-air missile during a trip in her plane. *Lun: A kung-fu master who died when delivering a package containing an explosive. Production =Background= Francois Bertrand was the sole programmer of Fight for Life during its entire development cycle, which lasted a year and a half. Francois Yves Bertrand first entered into the video game industry with the TRS-80 microcomputer during his high school period, writing a text-based adventure game for it as his very first title, with Bertrand later buying an Acorn Atom computer and he would continue working with computers manufactured by Acorn Computers. Several years later, Bertrand joined French developer Sisteme and worked on titles from the label such as Ballarena and Erotictac. He would also later form his own game development company in France, Eterna, developing and publishing several titles for the Acorn line of home computers such as Blaston. While working for Sisteme, Bertrand began developing a new idea that involved controlling a computer program without joystick input on some of the first digitizing cards available and playing it with an interface capable of analyzing player motion in front of a virtual camera system to control the game and creating a title along with it, however the developer was a small company uncapable of handling the project and would close its doors due to competition from Japanese developers, with neither his own company having the means in regards to marketing the technology. Bertrand contacted Sega of Japan about his then-newly developed technology, recorded a videotape showcasing it and sent it to the company. Interested in his technology after seeing the video, Sega suggested Bertrand to work for the company and they proceeded to arrange an interview with him in Japan, which resulted in his hiring and joining AM2 as one of the first foreign members within the division, along with modeler and animator Jeff Buchanan. Under the helm of Yu Suzuki, he and Buchanan formed part of the original Virtua Fighter development team, with Bertrand being responsible for creating the camera and collision systems seen in the game. Bertrand would continue working along with Buchanan at Sega in further projects for almost two years before moving to the United States, where he would offer his services to both The 3DO Company and Atari Corporation, with the latter recruiting him to be part of the software development teams for the Jaguar and becoming the sole lead programmer of Fight for Life. Silvio Porretta is a self-taught artist who began creating animation and raster graphics as an amusement for himself in his bedroom. Porretta first met with Bertrand during an exchanging of pirated games, who told him that he had his own game development company and needed both an artist and designer, with his first title being the aforementioned Blaston for Acorn computers. A few years later, he would join Atari Corp. with Bertrand, who managed to land a job for him at the company and was the sole artist of Fight for Life. =Development= Most of the artwork were first hand-drawn sketches created by Porretta before being transpose to pixel art graphics. Fight for Life entered into development in May 1994 and was handled by a small development team, with Francois Bertrand acting both as designer and director of the project, in addition of being its sole lead programmer. Besides the main team, the company BioVision assisted in its development process with their state-of-the-art motion capture system, which involved the filming of martial artists performing 250 moves with 25 reflective markers attached on determined parts of their bodies in order to record their movements that would allow characters to act in a realistic manner, with BioVision then converting the data into information that the Jaguar could read to display the actions, with Atari claiming that this process took place at 200 frames per second. High Voltage Software also assisted in the development of the game by creating artwork as well, although they were not credited as such in neither the manual nor in the in-game credits. Although Studio Gigante co-founder Richard Ho acted as the art director of the project, Silvio Porretta was the sole artist for the game, creating both concept and texture artwork for the characters, with Porretta stating that he learned texture mapping under a few weeks and quickly adapted to the tools at his disposal. The title song was composed by American musician Joe Vitale.Fight for Life sales flyer (Atari Jaguar, US) Fight for Life went through a troubled development cycle until it was released, with both Bertrand and Porretta stating that the reason why development took longer than expected was due to the state of Atari at the time as well as meddling from the company itself. On an April 1998 feature article by Next Generation magazine discussing some of the biggest failures in the gaming industry, it revealed that at least two producers were previously in charge of the game's production, with the second of them referring it as a \\"nightmare\\", while the manual in the final release lists Bill Rehbock as its executive producer. An anonymous former Atari employee claimed that the original producer constantly lied to the company's upper management into believing the game would redefine the fighting genre. He also claimed to be present at one meeting in particular where the game was compared to Namco's Tekken and the executives agreed it was a legitimate competitor to both Tekken and Tamsoft's Battle Arena Toshinden. Atari sent preview copies of an early build of the game to video game magazines, however the marketing department made a mistake of sending them with the sentence \\"for review only\\" instead of preview, leading to some publications reviewing the game in its early state and as a result of this error, the company told the press that they were going to \\"reject and revamp\\" the product, with Bertrand later stating that development was progressing normally. Fight for Life originally ran at 20 frames per second and the three- dimensional character models consisted of 900 polygons with very minimal texture mapping applied to them and featuring graphical effects such as light sourcing, with plans to increase their number to 1200 polygons, however the final release runs at 25 frames per second with models consisting between 600-800 polygons depending on the character and having minimal textures applied, while the visuals are displayed at a resolution of 320x240 in the 16-bit high color format. Despite the turbulent development and his lack of experience with previous Atari hardware, Bertrand enjoyed working with the Jaguar, regarding it as an interesting system to work on and claimed to be happy with the final product. Bertrand has stated in recent years that he would change certain aspects of the game if he had to rework the title. Release Fight for Life was first previewed across various video game magazines and the Do The Math promotional recording sent by Atari to video game retail stores in late 1994 under its earliest playable state, featuring several playable characters, five selectable stages and an early version of the replay feature, with gaming magazines immediately comparing the game to Virtua Fighter due to the involvement of Bertrand, and was slated for a December 1994/Q1 1995 release. The game made its first playable appearance at Atari's booth during the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 1995, featuring improved visuals compared to the earlier version. It would also make appearance on the showfloor of events such as Spring ECTS '95 and E3 1995 in a nearly complete state, with the latter being its last trade show appearance prior to being launched and where Bertrand showcased the project to attendees of the event, in addition of being slated for a Q2/Q3 1995 release date and remained to be previewed across various magazines. It was also covered by the press who were invited to Atari's UK division. Despite development of the game being completed in December 1995, Bertrand did not deliver the game until much later to Atari, who began laying off their employees and cancelling upcoming projects for the Jaguar before merging with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on July 30, 1996. Although the game was released in 1996 as the final Atari- published title for the Jaguar, Bertrand has since stated that the game was shipped in an almost finished state due to time and budget constraints, scrapping elements during the process. Despite rumors of a 100% complete build existing, there are no concrete evidence proving the existence of this version. =Fight for Life Beta= In 2005, a beta build of Fight for Life was released by the defunct Jaguar Sector II website under the title Fight for Life Beta, featuring several differences between it and the final release. Only a few copies were produced. Reception As a result of the mislabeling by Atari's marketing department, Next Generation reviewed a preview copy of the game, and said it had \\"some of the worst execution and gameplay yet.\\" The reviewer particularly mentioned the crude, clunky movements of the characters, which he likened to that of the toy Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. Upon the game's release Next Generation reviewed it again, but was only slightly more positive about the release version. The reviewer judged Fight for Life to be an effectively next generation fighter, saying the texture-mapped polygonal characters are detailed, the animation is smooth, and the true 3D movement and defense system are innovative. However, he concluded that the slow responsiveness of the controls and the extremely slow pace override these assets, since they make the game boring to play. The three reviewers of GameFan panned the game, heavily criticizing its graphics, camera, music, and gameplay. Dave Halverson concluded, \\"What an appropriate send-off for the Jag. A terrible system's terrible last hurrah\\". In a retrospective review, Kyle Knight of Allgame also found Fight for Lifes crippling flaw to be its slow controls and pace, speculating that \\"You could almost read a book while playing, and glance at the screen every so often to keep track of what's going on\\". However, he also described the graphics as having minimal detail and the animation as awkward. Noting the move-stealing feature to be its one positive quality, he summarized the game as \\"one of the poorest examples of 3D fighter you'll find anywhere\\". Legacy On April 18, 1996, the game's trademark was abandoned. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Seanbaby put it as number 3 in his \\"20 worst games of all time\\" feature. Years after its release, the game's source code would be released by Jaguar Sector II under a CD compilation for PC titled Jaguar Source Code Collection on August 24, 2008.

In music theory, voicing refers to one of two closely related concepts: # How a musician or group distributes, or spaces, notes and chords on one or more instruments # The simultaneous vertical placement of notes in relation to each other; this relates to the concepts of spacing and doubling It includes the instrumentation and vertical spacing and ordering of the musical notes in a chord: which notes are on the top or in the middle, which ones are doubled, which octave each is in, and which instruments or voices perform each note.  Vertical placement The following three chords are all C-major triads in root position with different voicings. The first is in close position (the most compact voicing), while the second and third are in open position (that is, with wider spacing). Notice also that the G is doubled at the octave in the third chord; that is, it appears in two different octaves. : { override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/4) time 4/4 set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"vibraphone\\" relative c' { 1^markup { column { \\"Close\\" \\"position\\" } } ^markup { column { \\"Open\\" \\"position\\" } } ^markup { column { \\"Open\\" \\"position\\" } } } } = Examples = Many composers, as they developed and gained experience, became more enterprising and imaginative in their handling of chord voicing. For example, the theme from the second movement of Ludwig van Beethoven‚Äôs early Piano Sonata No. 10 (1798), presents chords mostly in close position: Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 10, Andante On the other hand, in the theme of the Arietta movement that concludes his last piano sonata, Piano Sonata No. 32, Op. 111 (1822), Beethoven presents the chord voicing in a much more daring way, with wide gaps between notes, creating compelling sonorities that enhance the meditative character of the music: Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 32, Arietta: Listen Philip Barford describes the Arietta of Op. 111 as \\"simplicity itself‚Ä¶ its widely-spaced harmonization creates a mood of almost mystical intensity. In this exquisite harmonization the notes do not make their own track ‚Äì the way we play them depends upon the way we catch the inner vibration of the thought between the notes, and this will condition every nuance of shading.\\"Barford P. (1971, p. 147) \\"The Piano Music ‚Äì II\\" in Arnold, D. and Fortune, N. (eds) the Beethoven Companion. London, Faber. p. 146. William Kinderman finds it \\"extraordinary that this sensitive control of sonority is most evident in the works of Beethoven's last decade, when he was completely deaf, and could hear only in his imagination.\\"Kinderman, W. (1987) Beethoven's Diabelli Variations. Clarendon Press, Oxford. p. 64 During the Romantic Era, composers continued further in their exploration of sonorities that can be obtained through imaginative chord voicing. Alan Walker draws attention to the quiet middle section of Chopin‚Äôs Scherzo No. 1. In this passage, Chopin weaves a ‚Äúmagical‚Äù pianistic texture around a traditional Polish Christmas carol:Walker, A. (2018, p.189) Fryderyk Chopin, a Life and Times. London, Faber.Chopin Scherzo No. 1, bars 305-312Chopin Scherzo No. 1, bars 305-313 Maurice Ravel‚Äôs Pavane de la Belle au Bois Dormant from his 1908 suite Ma M√®re l'Oye exploits the delicate transparency of voicing afforded through the medium of the piano duet. Four hands can cope better that two when it comes to playing widely- spaced chords. This is especially apparent in bars 5‚Äì8 of the following extract:Pavane de la Belle au Bois Dormant. Listen Speaking of this piece (which also exists in an orchestral version), Austin writes about Ravel‚Äôs technique of \\"varying the sonority from phrase to phrase by telling changes of register.\\"Austin, W. (1966) Music in the 20th Century. London, Dent. p. 172.The two chords that open and close Igor Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms have distinctive sonorities arising out of the voicing of the notes. The first chord is sometimes called the Psalms chord. William W. Austin remarks: Some chord voicings devised by composers are so striking that they are instantly recognizable when heard. For example, The Unanswered Question by Charles Ives opens with strings playing a widely spaced G-major chord very softly, at the limits of audibility. According to Ives, the string part represents \\"The Silence of the Druids‚Äîwho Know, See and Hear Nothing\\".  Doubling  In a chord, a note that is duplicated in different octaves is said to be doubled. In the second chord below, the note E is doubled in two octaves, while G is \\"doubled\\" in three. : ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << relative c' { clef treble key c major time 4/4 e1 } >> ew Staff << relative c { clef bass key c major time 4/4 1 1 bar \\"\\" } >> >> Melodic doubling in parallel (also called parallel harmony) is the addition of a rhythmically similar or exact melodic line or lines at a fixed interval above or below the melody to create parallel movement.Benward & Saker (2009). Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II, p. 253. Eighth Edition. . Octave doubling of a voice or pitch is a number of other voices duplicating the same part at the same pitch or at different octaves. The doubling number of an octave is the number of individual voices assigned to each pitch within the chord. For instance, in the opening of John Philip Sousa's \\"Washington Post March\\",Benward & Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, p. 133, Vol. I. Seventh Edition. . the melody is \\"doubled\\" in four octaves. : { { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { relative c { set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t tempo 4. = 120 clef treble time 6/8 key f major 4ff 8 4.~ 4 8 4 **8 4 8 4.~ 4 8 4 **8 4 8 4 8 4 **8 4 8 8 r r -> r r } } ew Staff { relative c { clef bass time 6/8 key f major 4 8 4.~ 4 8 4 **8 4 8 4.~ 4 8 4 **8 4 8 4 8 4 **8 4 8 8 r r -> r r } } >> } } Consistent parallelism between melodic lines can impede the independence of the lines. For example, in m. 38 of the gigue from his English Suite No. 1 in A major, BWV 806, J.S. Bach avoids excessive parallel harmony in order to maintain the independence of the lines: parallel thirds (at the beginning) and parallel sixths (at the end) are not maintained throughout the entire measure, and no interval is in parallel for more than four consecutive notes. : ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << relative c' { set Score.currentBarNumber = #38 bar \\"\\" clef treble key a major time 6/8 fis16 gis a b cis a d cis b a gis fis } addlyrics { \\"3\\" \\"3\\" \\"3\\" \\"5\\" \\"7\\" \\"6\\" \\"3\\" \\"8\\" \\"6\\" \\"6\\" \\"6\\" \\"6\\" } >> ew Staff << relative c { clef bass key a major time 6/8 d16 e fis e d cis b cis d cis b a } >> >> Consideration of doubling is important when following voice leading rules and guidelines, for example when resolving to an augmented sixth chord never double either notes of the augmented sixth, while in resolving an Italian sixth it is preferable to double the tonic (third of the chord).Benward & Saker (2009), p. 106. Some pitch material may be described as autonomous doubling in which the part being doubled is not followed for more than a few measures often resulting in disjunct motion in the part that is doubling, for example, the trombone part in Mozart's Don Giovanni.Guion, David M. (1988). The Trombone: Its History and Music, 1697‚Äì1811, p. 133. Musicology: A Book Series, Vol. VI. Gordon and Breach. .  Drop voicings  One nomenclature for describing certain classes of voicings is the \\"drop-n\\" terminology, such as drop-2 voicings, drop-4 voicings, etc. (sometimes spelled without hyphens). This system views voicings as built from the top down (probably from horn-section arranging where the melody is a given). The implicit, non-dropped, default voicing in this system has all voices in the same octave, with individual voices numbered from the top down. The highest voice is the first voice or voice 1. The second-highest voice is voice 2, etc. This nomenclature doesn't provide a term for more than one voice on the same pitch. A dropped voicing lowers one or more voices by an octave relative to the default state. Dropping the first voice is undefined‚Äîa drop-1 voicing would still have all voices in the same octave, simply making a new first voice. This nomenclature doesn't cover the dropping of voices by two or more octaves or having the same pitch in multiple octaves. A drop-2 voicing lowers the second voice by an octave. For example, a C-major triad has three \\"drop-2 voicings\\". Reading down from the top voice, they are C E G, E G C, and G C E, which can be heard as the voicings supporting the first three melody notes (following the introductory phrase) of the Super Mario Bros. video game theme. : { ew Staff << override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/4) time 4/4 ew Voice relative c' { 2 ^markup { center-align { \\"drop-2\\" } } once stemUp ^markup { center-align { \\"drop-2\\" } } ^markup { center-align { \\"drop-2\\" } } } ew Voice relative c { override TextSpanner.bound-padding = #1.0 override TextSpanner.style = #'line override TextSpanner.bound- details.right.arrow = ##t override TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = #\\"fof\\" override TextSpanner.bound-details.right.text = #\\"gag\\" override TextSpanner.bound-details.right.padding = #0.6 override TextSpanner.bound- details.right.stencil-align-dir-y = #CENTER override TextSpanner.bound- details.left.stencil-align-dir-y = #CENTER override Glissando.bound- details.right.arrow = ##t override Glissando.arrow-length = #0.5 override Glissando.arrow-width = #0.25 g2glissando g, c'glissando c, e'glissando once stemDown e, } >> } There are four drop-2-and-4 voicings for G.

Illustration by Lorenz Fr√∏lich. Hrafnagaldr √ì√∞ins (\\"Odin's raven-galdr\\") or Forspjallslj√≥√∞ (\\"prelude poem\\") is an Icelandic poem in the style of the Poetic Edda. It is preserved only in late paper manuscripts. In his influential 1867 edition of the Poetic Edda, Sophus Bugge reasoned that the poem was a 17th-century work, composed as an introduction to Baldrs draumar. Since then it has not been included in editions of the Poetic Edda and not been extensively studied. But prior to Bugge's work the poem was considered a part of the Poetic Edda and included, for example, in the English translations of A. S. Cottle (1797) and Benjamin Thorpe (1866) as well as Karl Simrock's influential German translation (1851). In 1852, William and Mary Howitt characterized it as \\"amongst the most deeply poetical and singular hymns of the Edda\\". Date In 2002, J√≥nas Kristj√°nsson in the Icelandic daily Morgunbla√∞i√∞ argued in favor of an earlier dating than Bugge, perhaps to the 14th century, based on linguistic evidence and the seemingly corrupt state of the text., However, metrical, linguistic, and stylistic evidence all point towards a date in the 16th century at the earliest, and the scholarly consensus has rested on the seventeenth.. Annette Lassen, in her preliminary assessment (2006) had stated conservatively that this poem should not be subject to greater skepticism than e.g. Fj√∂lsvinnsm√°l and S√≥larlj√≥√∞ (other Eddic poems thought to be of later authorship and exist only in paper manuscripts). But in her 2011 critical edition with accompanying translation (rendered into English by Anthony Faulkes), she states unequivocally that the poem \\"is a postmedieval poem\\" probably composed soon after \\"the rediscovery of the Codex Regius of the Elder Edda in 1643\\". Elsewhere she assigns a terminus post quem to when the Icelanders were familiarized with Erasmus's Adagia (1500), which she says must have been the conduit through which the poet learned the adage in nocte consilium which is adapted into the poem in st. 22. Another dating clue is the occurrence of the word m√°lt√≠d st. 20, a Middle Low German loanword, used in Iceland after the middle of the 14th century, though the poem can \\"hardly be as old as that.\\" Contents The poem consists of 26 fornyr√∞islag eight-line stanzas. It involves several known figures from Norse mythology, including Odin, I√∞unn, Heimdallr, Loki and Bragi, but does not appear to describe a myth known from other sources. The poem begins with five stanzas of ominous introduction, the narrative proper setting in in stanza 6. Idunn falls from the world-tree (stanzas 6-7) and is given a wolfskin to wear (stanza 8). Alarmed, Odin sends a trio of messengers led by Heimdall to get news from a woman designated as \\"the doorpost of Gj√∂ll's sun\\" (Giallar sunnu g√°tt, a kenning for woman) (stanza 9). The identity of the woman that Heimdall and his companions visit in the lower world is not revealed. She has been variously identified as Idunn, Hela,Doepler, Emil (1881) and as Urd.; Rydberg, Viktor (1889) The messengers ask her the beginning, duration and end of heaven, the world, and hel (stanza 11). Tears are her only response (stanzas 12-13). The failed messengers return to Asgard, joining a feast in progress (stanzas 14-15). Heimdall tells the gods of their mission; Loki informs the goddesses (stanzas 16-19). The festivities conclude (stanza 21), and the onset of night is described in mythological terms (stanzas 22-26). In the final verse, Heimdall lifts his horn toward heaven. Manuscript tradition Hrafnagaldur √ì√∞ins is transmitted in a single version, with minimal discrepancies, contained in at least thirty-seven copies dating from the latter half of the 17th century to the 1870s, now housed in Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany and the United States. Annette Lassen used five manuscripts of critical value in her edition. All manuscripts that contain the poem include the subtitle Forspjallslj√≥√∞. * A - Stockholm papp. 8vo nr 15 :National Library of Sweden ca. 1650-1699. First brought to Sweden in 1681 by Gu√∞mun√∞ur √ìlafsson.

A portion was written ca. 1673-7 by √Åsgeir J√≥nsson, and the rest written in the 18th century, 8~9 scribes in all, according to Lassen, correcting P√°ll Eggert √ìlason‚Äôs catalogue date of 1660. * C - Stockholm papp. fol. nr 57 :National Library of Sweden. ca. 1650-1699 *D - Thott 1491 4to :Royal Library, Denmark 18th century. The first leaf bears inscription \\"Skrifud af Diakna Paule\\", identified by Lassen as Deacon P√°ll Sveinsson Torfasonar 1704‚Äì1784's Codex Ericianus or Codex E employed in the Arnamagn√¶an also refers to the deacon's manuscript by initial \\"P.S.\\" and uses variant readings from it. *E - Lbs 1441 4to :National Library of Iceland ca. 1760 Most other manuscripts of Hrafnagaldur √ì√∞ins are derived from A and B. The number and ordering of stanzas is the same in all manuscripts. There are only minor differences in the texts. The text of the poem is cryptic and most probably corrupt. The final stanza does not appear to form a satisfactory conclusion, suggesting that the poem as it has come down to us is incomplete. According to analysis of the best manuscripts, the various copies all derive from a single archetype. Since it is not transmitted in other than paper manuscripts, the poem is often considered a later work, possibly a post-medivael imitation of an Eddic poem, akin to Gunnarslagr (or Gunnars-slagr), composed by (1714-1791). Nevertheless, a vellum manuscript of the poem may once have existed. √Årni Magn√∫sson makes reference to the poem in a letter dated June 18, 1729 to J√≥n Halld√≥rsson, Dean of H√≠tardalur, raising the possibility that such a manuscript was lost in the Great Fire in Copenhagen of 1728, which destroyed a large part of Arni's library, including as many as 15 bound manuscripts of Eddic poetry. Bugge (who concluded the poem was of late authorship) knew the letter but dismissed it as unreliable., citing : \\"Lidet er at bygge paa Udtrykkene i ‚ÄûEn Skrivelse fra Arne Magnusen til Hr. John Haldorsen, Provst i Hitardal, dateret 18 Junii 1729..\\" Publication history The first printed edition of the poem appeared in the so-called Arnamagn√¶an edition of Edda S√¶mundar hinns fr√≥√∞i (1787). The tome was a collaboration of several co- editors, but Lassen identifies Guƒëmundur Magnusson (Gudmundus Magn√¶us, 1741-1798) as the poem's editor, translator (into Latin), and commentator. The text is that of MS Icel. 47, a manuscript edition made by , which contained variant readings, used in the critical apparatus of the edition. The critical apparatus also made use of commentary by aforementioned , scribbled on the manuscript AM 424 fol. The poem was published next in Edda S√¶mundar hinns fr√≥√∞a, 1818, edited by Rasmus Rask and Arvid August Afzelius. Hallgrimur Scheving (1837), P.A. Munch (1847), Hermann L√ºning (1859), Theodor M√∂bius (1860), and Frederich Wilhelm Bergmann (1875) also published editions of the poem. Finnur Magnusson (1822), Karl Simrock (1851) and Benjamin Thorpe (1865) produced translations into Danish, German and English respectively. Sophus Bugge in his 1867 edition of the Poetic Edda argued that the poem was a work of the 17th century, and after this, it was mostly ignored by editors and students of the Edda. An exception is Viktor Rydberg, who in 1886 accepted the poem as authentic and sought to explain its narrative as referring to the time Idun was taken from Asgard by Thjazi.Rydberg, Unders√∂kningar i Germanisk Mythologi, I Reception Interest in the poem has been renewed after 1998, when Eysteinn Bj√∂rnsson and William P. Reaves posted an edition of the poem with English translation and commentary online. Although this edition was \\"for the most part removed again in 2002\\", leaving only the English translation of the poem in its place, Eysteinn Bj√∂rnsson and Reaves' work on the poem led to the performance of the choral and orchestral work Odin's Raven Magic with music by Sigur R√≥s, Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson, and Steind√≥r Andersen. In support of this, their translation was printed in the program of the London performance of the work at the Barbican Centre in 2002. This popular interest in the poem was followed by an Icelandic edition, edited by Icelandic philologist J√≥nas Kristjansson, former head of the Arni Magnusson Institute, published in the Lesb√≥k of the Icelandic newspaper Morgunbla√∞id, 27/4 2002 in which he acknowledges the recent popular works.

It was historically brewed with low alcohol levels, but modern productions of the style have moderate to high levels of alcohol. Along with several other varieties, it is generally classified as a farmhouse ale.  History  As a beer style, saison began as a pale ale brewed in the cooler, less active months in farmhouses in Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, and stored for drinking in the summer months. These farmhouse beers would have been of a lower ABV than modern saisons‚Äîaround 3 to 3.5% ABV on average, rising in the early 20th century to between 4.5 and 6.5% ABV. In the Middle Ages, the low-gravity beer was served as a clean source of hydration for workers who consumed up to five liters per day. Brewing outside of the hotter summer months was common for all breweries before the invention of refrigeration, due to the likelihood of the beer spoiling while fermenting in the summer, due to the prevalence of airborne bacteria activity. Farmers also brewed during the cooler months to provide work for their permanent staff during the quieter period. After brewing, the beer was stored until the summer when the main consumers would be seasonal workers (\\"saisonniers\\"). Historically, saisons did not share enough identifiable characteristics to pin them down as a specific style, but rather were a group of refreshing summer ales made by farmers. Each farm brewer would make his own distinctive version. Although most commercial examples now range from 5 to 8% ABV, originally saisons were meant to be refreshing and it is thought they had alcohol levels ranging from 3 to 3.5%. Modern saisons are generally highly carbonated, fruity and spicy ‚Äî sometimes from the addition of spices.  Composition  The type of malt determines the color of the saison, and although most saisons are of a cloudy golden color as result of the grist being mostly pale or pilsner malt, the use of darker malts results in some saisons being reddish-amber. Some recipes also use wheat. Spices such as orange zest, coriander, and ginger may be used. Some spice character may come through due to the production of esters during fermentation at warm temperatures. Modern examples brewed in the US tend to copy the yeast used by the Dupont Brewery, which ferments better at warmer temperatures like than the standard fermenting temperature used by other Belgian ales.

History The Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucat√°n (United Railways of Yucatan) was founded in 1902 by the merger of 3 rail lines operating in the Yucatan Peninsula. No rail lines then connected the Yucatan to the rest of Mexico, so most commerce between the Peninsula and the rest of Mexico was by sea.

It is often considered to be the physical inverse of the pyroelectric effect. It should not be confused with the Thermoelectric effect (specifically, the Peltier effect), in which a temperature difference occurs when a current is driven through an electric junction with two dissimilar conductors. The underlying mechanism of the effect is not fully established; in particular, different textbooks give conflicting explanations. However, as with any isolated (adiabatic) temperature change, the effect comes from the voltage raising or lowering the entropy of the system.See Reif (The magnetocaloric effect is an analogous, but better-known and understood, phenomenon.) Electrocaloric materials were the focus of significant scientific interest in the 1960s and 1970s, but were not commercially exploited as the electrocaloric effects were insufficient for practical applications, the highest response being 2.5 degrees Celsius under an applied potential of 750 volts. In March 2006 it was reported in the journal Science that thin films of the material PZT (a mixture of lead, titanium, oxygen and zirconium) showed the strongest electrocalorific response yet reported, with the materials cooling down by as much as ~12 K (12 ¬∞C) for an electric field change of 480 kV/cm, at an ambient temperature of 220 ¬∞C (430 ¬∞F). The device structure consisted of a thin film (PZT) on top of a much thicker substrate, but the figure of 12 K represents the cooling of the thin film only. The net cooling of such a device would be lower than 12 K due to the heat capacity of the substrate to which it is attached. Along the same lines, in 2008, it was shown that a ferroelectric polymer can also achieve 12 K of cooling, nearer room temperature. , alternate web link. With these new, larger responses, practical applications may be more likely, such as in computer cooling or batteries.

The game is the sequel to 1986's Rolling Thunder, retaining the same gameplay of its predecessor but adding cooperative gameplay for two players and improved graphics. Unlike the original, which was based in 1968, Rolling Thunder 2 features a more contemporary setting to go along with its more futuristic design, as well as an optionally playable female character. A port for the Sega Genesis was released the same year. Both the Mega Drive port and the original arcade game were released for the Wii Virtual Console on December 4, 2007 and October 27, 2009 respectively. Gameplay Set in the 1990s, the Geldra organization, thought to had been destroyed during the first game, returns and is destroying several of the world's satellites in outer space. As in the original Rolling Thunder, the players must take control of a member of the WCPO's Rolling Thunder task force. Two players can now play simultaneously, with Player 1 as female agent Leila and Player 2 as male agent Albatross. Even though they possess different external appearances, including different handguns, the two characters have identical abilities (much like Y≈´ichir≈ç Tomari and Sunday Chin from Namco's own Ordyne, which was released two years earlier and is also a Namco System 2 game). As with the original game, both Leila and Albatross can only take two physical hits from the enemies - and a hit from a bullet or other projectile such as a laser will result in an immediate death for them. Both of them are armed with a default pistol that has only limited ammo; when bullets run out, their guns shall fire a slow \\"chaser\\" bullet instead. The players can also upgrade to a sub machine gun (based on a Walther MP from the artwork), by entering marked doors - and when entering one of these marked doors, a counter shall appear, which indicates the number of remaining bullets left to be picked up (allowing one player to leave ammo for the other). Unlike in the original Rolling Thunder, pistol and machine gun ammunition is not carried over at the end of each level and you always start a new level with the minimum pistol rounds only. The graphics are noticeably improved over the previous game and have a decidedly more futuristic look to go along with the game's modern setting; the game's main enemy characters, the Maskers, who were previously designed to look like hooded terrorists (or Foot Soldiers of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game) are now cyborgs. Likewise, the game has more varied stage designs, with the first four stages taking place in a seaside resort in Florida, and the last four stages in a pyramid in Egypt - both locations are actually camouflaged Geldra bases. Reception The home version of Rolling Thunder 2 was well received. Its mostly highly positive review scores included 92% from Computer & Video Games, 23/25 from GamePro,GamePro 29 (December 1991), pages 64-65. 85% from Mean Machines, 90% from MegaTech, and, retrospectively, 8/10 from Sega-16. Reviews of the Virtual Console release were often more critical, including being rated 6/10 by GameSpot, 6.5/10 by IGN, and 8/10 by Nintendo Life.

Although some local stations predate Radio Pakistan's founding, it is the oldest existing broadcasting network in Pakistan. The network was established on 14 August 1947, following Pakistan's independence from Britain. Radio Pakistan services include AM news services and FM 101 and FM 93.  History  Radio Pakistan was originally known as the Pakistan Broadcasting Service at the time of its inception on 14 August 1947. It had the honour of publicly announcing Pakistan's independence from Britain on 13 August 1947 at 11:59 pm. Mustafa Ali Hamdani made the announcement from Lahore in Urdu and English, while Abdullah Jan Maghmoom made the announcement from Peshawar in Pashto. The announcement was heard as follows: > The English translation of this announcement is as follows: > Greetings Pakistan Broadcasting Service. We are speaking from Lahore. The > night between the thirteenth and fourteenth of August, year forty-seven. It > is twelve o'clock. Dawn of Freedom. Mustafa Ali Hamdani Radio Pakistan broadcasts are in 34 languages: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, Seraiki, Potowari, Pashto, Hindko, Kohistani, Khowar, Kashmiri, Gojri, Burushaski, Balti, Shina, Wakhi, Hazargi, Brahvi, English, Chinese, Dari, Persian, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Sinhala, Nepali, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, and Bengali. According to one of the pioneers of Radio Pakistan, Agha Nasir (9 February 1937 - 12 July 2016), three radio stations at Dhaka (established in 1939), Lahore (1937) and Peshawar Radio Station (1935) existed at the time of independence of Pakistan on 14 August 1947. There was no radio station in the capital of Pakistan, Karachi in 1947. On a high priority basis, a major program of expansion saw new stations opened at Karachi and Rawalpindi in 1948, and a new broadcasting house at Karachi in 1950. This was followed by new stations at Hyderabad (1951), Quetta (1956), a second station at Rawalpindi (1960) and a Receiving Centre at Peshawar (1960). In 1970, training facilities were opened in Islamabad and a station opened at Multan. A 1973 law, signed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (President and later Prime minister) regulated Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) as \\"to publish, circulate, distribute and regulate (reliable and trusted) news and information in any part of the world in any manner that may be deemed fit\\". Its one core mission states: \\"education, news and information to be brought to public awareness the whole range of significant activity.\\". It was converted into Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation on 20 December 1972 as a statutory body governed by the Board of Directors and Director General. The Radio Pakistan World Service was established on 21 April 1973. The service reached the remotest parts of Pakistan with stations at Gilgit (1977) and Skardu (1977) in the far north and Turbat (1981) in the far southwest. From 1981 to 1982 stations and transmitters were also established at Dera Ismail Khan, Khuzdar and Faisalabad. Radio Pakistan opened a new broadcasting house in Khairpur on 7 May 1986, followed by relay stations in 1989 at Sibi and on 21 March 1991 in Abbottabad. The remoter parts of the country began to receive coverage with new stations opened in the 1990s at Chitral, Loralai and Zhob. In 1997, the Federal Minister of Information inaugurated the computerisation of the PBC news processing system and availability of the news bulletins on the Internet in text and audio form. FM 101 Channel of PBC was launched on 1 October 1998 having stations at Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi and now this channel have nine stations throughout Pakistan and is the biggest FM Radio network of Pakistan. In October 1998, Radio Pakistan started FM transmission and over the period 2002‚Äì2005, new FM stations were opened at Islamabad, Gwadar, Mianwali, Sargodha, Kohat, Bannu and Mithi. In the last two and a half years, three new networks have been launched by PBC. On 28 August 2008, PBC launched National Broadcasting Service (NBS) the first dedicated Current Affairs Channel. It is a combination of 5 (100 KW) AM transmitters permanently linked together to broadcast a single national program beamed across Pakistan. Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Quetta and Karachi are the main stations generating the national programming. It is a 17 hours programming on major national and international issues, target audience and literary and cultural programs. PBC launched a new Community FM channel after February 2009 Station Directors Conference. The network is called FM-93 Network with 22 stations across Pakistan. Gilgit, Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, Abbottabad, Chitral, Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Sargodha, Mianwali, Faislabad, Lahore, Multan, Larkana, Khairpur, Bhit Shah, Hyderabad, Mithi, Karachi and Gwadar transmit the FM 93 network.

In Norse mythology, the megingj√∂r√∞ (meaning \\"power-belt\\"Orchard (1997:110) in Old Norse) is a belt worn by the god Thor. The Old Norse name megin means power or strength, and gj√∂r√∞ means belt. According to the Prose Edda, the belt is one of Thor's three main possessions, along with the hammer Mj√∂lnir and the iron gloves J√°rngreipr. When worn, the belt is described as doubling Thor's already prodigious strength. In verse 7 of the skaldic poem √û√≥rsdr√°pa (Thorsdrapa, Lay of Thor) written by the 10th- century poet Eil√≠fr Go√∞r√∫narson, in the service of Jarl H√°kon Sigur√∞arson, refers to Thor's power-belt. > Har√∞vaxnar s√©r her√∞ir halllands of sik falla (gatat ma√∞r) nj√≥tr (hin neytri) > njar√∞- (r√°√∞ fyrir s√©r) gjar√∞ar. √ûverrir l√¶tr nema √æyrri √ûorns barna s√©r > M«´rnar snerribl√≥√∞ til sv√≠ra sal√æaks megin vaxa. The line \\"nj√≥tr njar√∞gjar√∞ar\\" literally means \\"he who benefits from the mighty belt\\", referring to Thor's magical belt/girdle of strength/power, Megingj√∂r√∞. In Gylfaginning, which is the first part of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, after Prologue, verse 45 refers to Thor's power-belt. > En er kom at dagan, √æ√° gekk √û√≥rr √∫t ok s√©r mann, hvar l√° skammt fr√° honum √≠ > sk√≥ginum, ok var s√° eigi l√≠till.

It is leased to Ferrocarril del Sureste FERROSUR. It was formerly leased to Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab until Genesee & Wyoming gave up its concession in 2007.Central America going nowhere. Railway Gazette International August 2007. Originally it was known as the Tehuantepec Railway. History of the Tehuantepec Railway The potential of the route from the Atlantic to the Pacific across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec has long been appreciated. As early as 1814 the Spanish government authorized a canal across the Isthmus. Soon after Mexico became independent in 1821, surveys were carried out which recommended constructing a plank trail for wagons through the Chivela Pass, with the northernmost part of the route using the Coatzacoalcos River which flows northward to the Gulf of Mexico on the Atlantic side of the isthmus. The river would be dredged to allow navigation. Nothing came of either of these plans. An illustration from Barnard's Survey of the Tehuantepec routeMore serious planning began in the early 1840s, when Jos√© de Garay, the First Officer of the Ministry of War obtained a concession on the route and carried out a more thorough survey. After many failed attempts to obtain funding, the concession was taken over by a New Orleans company, The Tehuantepec Railroad Company of New Orleans (TRCNO). Despite diplomatic problems over the status of the concession, a further survey of the route was carried out by Major John G. Barnard. This was published in 1852. The years between 1852 and 1861 were turbulent both diplomatically and financially. The opening of the Panama Railroad in 1854 provided competition for the Tehuantepec route, but also gave warning that the TRNCO's cost estimates were wildly optimistic. The Panic of 1857 made raising capital for transportation projects more difficult. There were disputes over the concession with the Mexican Government. In spite of this, the company managed to construct a wagon trail (not a railroad) along the route, and offer a service for passengers and mail from New Orleans to San Francisco, starting in 1858. It was too little too late, however, and the company became insolvent in 1860. The outbreak of the American Civil War and the French intervention in Mexico the following year ended any immediate hope of reviving the project. After the Civil War ended, there was once again interest in trans-isthmus routes, in particular for a canal. A commission was appointed by the US Government in 1872. A new survey of the Tehuantepec route had been carried out by Admiral R. W. Shufeldt in 1870, but in spite of his positive report the commission recommended a route through Nicaragua in 1876. No government action resulted, however, and actual canal construction was started in Panama in 1881 by a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps. A radically different solution was proposed by James B. Eads - a ship-railway. Rather than a canal, he proposed a 6-track railway across the isthmus, with ships of up to 6,000 tons carried in a specially designed cradle. Eads' ideas received considerable support in the USA, but he died in 1887, and this was effectively the end of the proposal. Newspaper report of the completion of the Tehuantepac RailroadRailroad construction actually continued during this period, and the line was completed in 1894. However it had many problems, including inadequate port facilities at each end, and varying standards of construction along the route. It soon became clear that a complete overhaul was necessary, and Weetman D. Pearson was contracted by the Mexican Government to undertake the work. The line was stabilized, and where necessary structures were rebuilt. Port facilities were established at Coatzacoalcos and Salina Cruz. The newly refurbished line opened in 1907. The locomotives on the line were oil-burning steam locomotives. The Tehuantepec Railroad was one of the first to use this source of power. SS Texan , one of the freighters used on the Tehuantepec routeThe American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, which had been operating from San Francisco and Hawaii to New York through the Straits of Magellan contracted to provide connecting steamship lines to both ends of the railroad, allowing a 25 day service between San Francisco and New York. Sugar became a major part of the freight, amounting to 250,000 tons annually, and most of the sugar from Hawaii to Philadelphia and New York was carried on this route. The railroad prospered for seven years, until the Panama Canal opened in 1914. Despite optimistic forecasts that there was plenty of business for both the railroad and the canal, business declined drastically after 1914, not helped by the Mexican Revolution and the onset of the First World War. The railroad continued to handle substantial passenger traffic well into the fifties, but ceased to be a significant carrier of freight.

According to an email sent March 13th: \\"In light of the latest local and statewide guidance in response to COVID-19, Pacific Arts Movement has decided to postpone the upcoming 10th Annual SDAFF Spring Showcase, originally scheduled from April 16 to April 23, 2020 - to take place later this year.\\" Background SDAFF is the flagship event for the non-profit organization Pacific Arts Movement (Pac- Arts, formerly the San Diego Asian Film Foundation), which also puts on several other arts and culture events throughout the year. The mission of Pacific Arts Movement is to present Pan Asian media arts to San Diego residents and visitors in order to inspire, entertain and support a more compassionate society. Throughout the year, Pacific Arts Movement offers student internships, cultural literacy programs with local high schools and colleges, and a high school filmmaker project entitled ‚ÄúReel Voices.‚Äù Pacific Arts Movement also teams up with several movie production and marketing companies to promote both independent and mainstream films that are inline with the mission of the organization. History SDAFF found its inception in August 2000 when it was first organized as a fundraiser by the Asian American Journalists Association. After receiving numerous film entries, both domestically and internationally, and seeing sold out crowds at its inaugural festival, Lee Ann Kim, the founding director, saw the potential of making SDAFF an organizational entity of its own. Kim teamed up with several journalists, writers, filmmakers, and community leaders to turn the film festival into the larger non-profit organization that Pacific Arts Movement is today. Since then, the org and SDAFF have consistently grown in size and recognition with each passing year.

The program accepts around 10 students per year. Students are paired with a mentor and helped to compose a nonfiction documentary film by the Reel Voices staff and volunteers. The final product is screened at SDAFF where the students participate in a Q&A; session after the showing. In 2014, Reel Voices expanded programs to launch a media arts elective class at the Monarch School in San Diego's Barrio Logan for high school students interested in film production and digital storytelling.

Their LPs were individualized by the slogan \\"The Sound of Magnificence\\", a puffy cloud logo and sepia-toned photo of the orchestra. The 101 Strings orchestra included 124 string instruments, and was conducted by Wilhelm Stephan. The orchestra's famous official photograph was taken in the Musikhalle Hamburg. History =Miller and rock and roll= Record label mogul David L. Miller came to prominence by releasing the first Bill Haley & His Comets‚Äô records in 1952‚Äì1953 on his own Essex label (followed by Trans- World, then Somerset Records). In this capacity, Miller played a role in the creation of rock and roll. =Miller and 101 Strings= Following the rise of mood music (practitioners Mantovani and Jackie Gleason Presents), Miller subcontracted the Orchester des Nordwestdeutschen Rundfunks Hamburg (the Northwest German Radio Orchestra of Hamburg) conducted by Wilhelm Stephan to play in-house arrangements of popular standards. The first three 101 Strings albums were released in November 1957, and twelve more titles were released in 1958 (many of which featured recycled material from earlier albums attributed to the New World Orchestra, Rio Carnival Orchestra, and other light music orchestras). These records were pressed by Miller's own plants and released through his own distribution channels (such as grocery stores). His core staff arrangers were Monty Kelly, Joseph Francis Kuhn, and Robert Lowden. All three proved adept at writing original compositions that were stylistically consistent both with contemporary hit songs and each other. Miller placed these on 101 Strings albums to provide additional publishing revenues. Kelly's earliest successes were Latin and Spanish travelogues (such as the \\"Soul of Spain\\" series), although he became 101 Strings' \\"Now Sound\\" specialist following the British Invasion. Kuhn concentrated on radio-friendly numbers in the \\"Pops\\"'s orchestral manner (\\"Blues Pizzicato\\", etc.) which provided Somerset its initial catalog of originals. Lowden composed lounge ballads (such as \\"Blue Twilight\\"). Their body of early 1960s work was recycled via re- release throughout the next twenty years. =Sherman and 101 Strings= In 1964, Miller sold the franchise to Al Sherman, a successful record label distributor, who renamed the label Alshire (based in Los Angeles) and moved recording to London. Sherman retained Miller as a partner to oversee production and A&R.; The Alshire era is characterized by large-scale expansion of product, attempts to branch out to younger markets and beginning in 1969, eventual stagnation (although late efforts by Les Baxter and Nelson Riddle were released under the 101 name in 1970's). Output decreased from 1974 on. A tribute to John Lennon (composed of earlier Beatle tribute material ‚Äì 101 Strings play Hits written by The Beatles) in January 1981 marked the final 101 Strings effort. Many 101 Strings albums are simply orchestrated versions of pop hits and show tunes, although the early Somerset material contains many examples of the exotica and lounge genres. East of Suez (1959), In a Hawaiian Paradise (1960), and Songs of the Seasons in Japan (1964) are three such albums. 101 Strings Play the Blues (1958) and Back Beat Symphony were early experiments in symphonic-pop hybridization, while Fly Me to the Moon (1961) contains five noir-ish originals. Alshire releases include ‚ÄòNow Sound‚Äô albums such as The Sounds and Songs of the Jet Set (1965), Sounds of Today (1967), and Astro-Sounds from Beyond the Year 2000 (1969), the last of which has been frequently sampled by electronic music artists of the 1990s and 2000s (decade). =Current Ownership= The Alshire catalog was sold to Tom Ficara and RKO Records in the 1990s. This acquisition is verified in the US Copyright Office. For many years, Madacy, a Canadian Company, claimed ownership but this was never verified in the United States. =Sales= In the 24 years of their existence, 101 Strings sold over 50,000,000 records worldwide.

Heart ( ) is a children's novel by the Italian author Edmondo De Amicis who was a novelist, journalist, short story writer, and poet. The novel is his best known work to this day, having been inspired by his own children Furio and Ugo who had been schoolboys at the time. It is set during the Italian unification, and includes several patriotic themes. It was issued by Treves on October 18, 1886, the first day of school in Italy, and rose to immediate success. Through its investigation of social issues such as poverty, Heart shows the influence of left-wing ideologies on De Amicis' work (he was later to join the Italian Socialist Party). Because of this, the book remained influential (and the staple of many textbooks) in countries of the Eastern Bloc. On the other hand, the book's strong evocation of Italian nationalism and patriotism also made it very welcome in Fascist Italy. Plot and characters The novel is written in a diary form as told by Enrico Bottini, an 11-year-old primary school student in Turin with an upper class background who is surrounded by classmates of working class origin. The entire chronological setting corresponds to the third-grade season of 1881-82 (Enrico says it has been four years since death of Victor Emmanuel II, king of Italy, and the succession by Umberto I, and also tells about the death of Giuseppe Garibaldi, which happened in 1882). Enrico's parents and older sister Silvia interact with him as written in his diary. As well as his teacher who assigns him with homework that deals with several different stories of children throughout the Italian states who should be seen as role models ‚Äì these stories are then given in the book as Enrico comes upon reading them. Every story revolves around a different moral value, the most prominent of which are helping those in need, having great love and respect for family and friends, and patriotism. These are called 'The Monthly Stories' and appear at the end of every school month.

Reception and legacy  The novel was translated into Chinese in the early 20th century (with the title \\"ÊÑõÁöÑÊïôËÇ≤\\" ‚Äì literally The Education of Love) and became quite well known in East Asia. It was translated into Spanish with the title, Coraz√≥n: Diario de un ni√±o meaning Heart: Diary of a Child. The book was very popular in Latin countries, such as Mexico, among young boys and girls in the 1960s and 1970s. The novel was also extremely popular and influential in 1950s Israel, though at present it is considered rather old-fashioned and no longer well-known to the current generation of young Israelis. In 1887, a sequel, called Testa (Head), was written by neurologist Paolo Mantegazza, Amicis' friend, which narrates the life of Enrico in his teens. In 1962, Umberto Eco published Elogio di Franti (In Praise of Franti) viewing Franti, the \\"bad boy\\" of the novel, as a figure of resistance against militarist and nationalist ideology.Maria Truglio, Wise Gnomes, Nervous Astronauts, and a Very Bad General: The Children's Books of Umberto Eco and Eugenio Carmi Children's Literature, Volume 36, 2008, The Johns Hopkins University Press, p.126 One of the two teenage characters in the film I Prefer the Sound of the Sea (2000) reads Cuore and has a job in a bookshop named Franti. The book has been used as one of the inspirations for academic achievement in Mexico, having used the name of the author for one of the world schools of the International Baccalaureate called Instituto D¬¥Amicis, located in the city of Puebla. Adaptations In 1948, it was made into a film, directed by Vittorio De Sica and Duilio Coletti. One of the stories, \\"From the Apennines to the Andes,\\" became the basis of the 1976 anime series 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother. The series consisted of 52 episodes and was broadcast in the World Masterpiece Theatre. The whole series was viewable in many different languages, and became popular all over the world. In conclusion to the series, a movie was released in 1980 that was later remade, also as a feature film, released in 1999. Cuore itself was later adapted in its entirety by Nippon Animation, as the 26-episode series in 1981. This series was also broadcast on Italian TV as Cuore. School of Love: Story of Heart was very popular in Iran for the generation born after the Iranian Revolution. The series name, which was broadcast in Iran several times, was changed to Students of Alp Mountains (ÿ™). In 1984, a television miniseries based on the novel was produced by RAI and directed by Luigi Comencini. In 2009 Heart: Diary of a Child was created as an audiobook by Carlos Acosta in English and Spanish languages (see external links). Note and reference Li, Siya.

The story revolves around a newly made vampire who is trying to live as a \\"good\\" vampire and not feed on humans. Jeremy is played by Robert Sean Leonard with Ren√© Auberjonois as Jeremy's vampire guidance counselor and David Warner as a vampire hunter. The film's themes include prejudice, identity, gender roles, and adolescence. Plot Jeremy Capello (Robert Sean Leonard) is a typical American teenager from Houston struggling with getting himself a girlfriend. Although he has caught the eye of his school's head cheerleader Candy (LeeAnne Locken), he has his attention fixed on his classmate and band geek Darla Blake (Cheryl Pollak), who in turn is unnerved by his constant staring at her. Recently, Jeremy has been having some weird nightmares about a strange woman trying to seduce him, and later he actually encounters that woman named Nora (Cecilia Peck), who makes an obvious invitation to him, while delivering groceries. His skirt-chasing friend Ralph (Evan Mirand) convinces him to take up the opportunity for a first erotic experience. But the encounter goes badly: First the woman bites him in the neck, then two strangers burst into the house, forcing Jeremy to run for his life. The next morning, Jeremy looks pale and does not feel well, and he sees in his father's newspaper that Nora's house has mysteriously burned down. Also, throughout the day he notices a strange man observing him. This man pops into his bedroom the very next night, introduces himself as Modoc (Ren√© Auberjonois) and carefully attempts to relay to Jeremy that he is now a vampire (albeit a living one, not an undead). Jeremy is initially highly skeptical, but a sudden aversion to garlic, an increasing sensitivity to sunlight and craving for blood slowly convince him otherwise. His new vampire \\"life-style\\" hampers his attempts to start a relationship with Darla, who has finally become interested in him; otherwise Jeremy begins to adapt to the minor impacts the change has brought to his life. Modoc even gives him a guide book and explains to him that vampires are just like any other \\"minority group\\" that has been persecuted over the centuries. Slowly, Jeremy's parents (Kenneth Kimmins and Fannie Flagg) notice that their son is behaving \\"most peculiarly\\" and begin to suspect that he may be a homosexual and that he is getting mixed up with bad company. To add to the ensuing confusion, the two men who had burst in on Jeremy's adventure are actually vampire hunters: Zealous professor Leopold McCarthy (David Warner) is determined to stop a \\"vampire armageddon\\" with the help of his feeble assistant Grimsdyke (Paul Willson). They are in the process of tracking their newest victim, but due to a mix-up they believe that Ralph is the vampire. One night, when Jeremy finally begins to exploit his new capabilities and wins back Darla's trust, McCarthy and Grimstyke kidnap Ralph and intend to \\"free his soul\\" in a small chapel. Jeremy and Darla arrive in time to save him, but then Jeremy is recognized as a vampire, and only his new-found power of hypnotism and the timely arrival of Modoc and Nora, who has come back from the dead, manage to save the day. Since McCarthy remains unrelenting, Modoc's female consorts turn McCarthy into a vampire, making a friend out of an enemy. The film ends with the Capellos assuring Jeremy that they love him and want to help him deal with his \\"problem\\". Jeremy then introduces Darla to his delightfully surprised parents, while Ralph just shakes his head at the whole hubbub.

Its local government area is the Shire of Broomehill-Tambellup.  History  The town of Broomehill owes its creation to the Great Southern Railway, which was completed in 1889. The railway runs from Beverley to Albany. Broomehill is named after Sir Frederick Napier Broome (1842‚Äì96) who was then the Governor of Western Australia. Gold bearing quartz was discovered by the station master around Broomehill in 1889. In the same year Patrick Garrity purchased two lots facing Jasper Street and built a galvanised iron hotel. By 1905 the hotel had been rebuilt in brick with more extensions added in 1908. Known as the Broomehill Hotel and later as the Imperial Hotel, the two storey tuck pointed building is now heritage listed. The townsite was gazetted by the Western Australian Land Company in 1890, which was recognised by the state government in 1897. A group of settlers from the now extinct town of Eticup moved to the present site of Broomehill to help establish a township after the construction of the railway was completed. These settlers included the Withams, the Walshes, and the Curnows. These three families worked hard to establish the early structures. A Victorian named Hamilton acquired of land around the townsite in 1890; T. W. Powell also acquired near the town from the Western Australian Land Company. A branch of the Commercial Bank of Australia was opened in the town-site in 1891. In 1892, a police station and post office were also established. The Imperial Hotel was operating in the town by late 1892. The Broomehill Agricultural Hall was opened by T. Norris, a settler of the area, in 1898. The population of the town was 72 (37 males and 35 females) in 1898. A local Progress association was formed in 1905 with C.J. Darcy taking the position of Chairman. Broomehill Football Club had been established in or before 1907, playing games against surrounding towns such as Katanning. A cooperative was discussed in 1920 with insufficient capital being raised, in 1921 the cooperative commenced operations after having taken over the premises of Messrs E. Garrity and Company. The official spelling of Broomehill was changed from two words to one in 1959. Economy The main industry in town is wheat farming with the town being a Cooperative Bulk Handling receival site. There is also some sheep farming, while more recently farmers have diversified into viticulture and aquaculture (in the form of barramundi farming). Features The Holland Track, a well known walking and 4WD track, begins in Broomehill and ends in Coolgardie. The track was established in 1893 by the pioneer John Holland through the bush via Newdegate to the goldfields at Coolgardie.

He was made a member of the French Academy of Science in 1867; in 1880 founded a meteorological observatory near Colmar; and later devoted himself to astronomy. Hirn was educated in the shop, and his works are marked by much practical criticism of mere academic theory.

The line was built through remote and difficult terrain in two stages: the section from Craigendoran to Fort William opened in 1894, with a short extension to Banavie on the Caledonian Canal opening in 1895. It had originally been intended to extend to Roshven, to give good access to sea-going fishery vessels, but the end point was altered to Mallaig, and this section opened in 1901. The Mallaig Extension was notable for the extensive use of mass concrete in making structures for the line; at the time this was a considerable novelty. The line never made a profit, and relied on Government financial support, which was given (amid much controversy) to improve the depressed economic conditions of the region. It was worked by the North British Railway, which later took the company over. Except for a short stub at Banavie the entire line remains in use, and it is considered to be one of the most scenic railway lines in Britain. Before the railways System map of the West Highland RailwayPrior to the nineteenth century the western highlands of Scotland formed a wild tract of land, with mountainous terrain threaded by deep river valleys. The soil was generally poor and not conducive to productive agriculture, and land transport was poor. After the Jacobite rising of 1715 military roads were constructed for the purpose of military control, but these were limited to the area from Crieff to south of the Great Glen. The most efficient transport medium was coastal shipping. Railways became a practicable means of transport around the end of the eighteenth century especially in mineral districts, in many cases at first as short- distance adjuncts to waterways; the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway of 1826 is notable in the development in Scotland. In 1842 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened, showing the way for inter-urban general purpose railways, and the easing of the money market in the following years led to a frenzy of promotion of railways, in which a huge number of schemes were put forward, not all of them viable.John Thomas, The West Highland Railway, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1965 revised 1976, The railway mania The climax of this was in 1845, the year in which the Caledonian Railway obtained its Act of Parliament, authorising the creation of capital of ¬£1.5 million to build a railway from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Carlisle. Other Scottish trunk railways were authorised in the same year, and this encouraged the promotion of increasingly wild schemes intended to be submitted to Parliament in the following session. The West Highlands of Scotland were not omitted from the schemes proposed. Prospectuses were issued for the Scottish Western Railway and the Scottish North Western Railway, as well as the Scottish Grand Junction Railway and others. Some of the prospectuses told of abundant income and easy construction through imaginary gently rolling land. One line at least admitted the mountainous character of the area but proposed the use of the atmospheric system to overcome the difficulty. The tightness of money in 1846 and the following years put paid to all the West Highland schemes. As other railways were opened and operating, there remained a large area on the map of Scotland not served by any, and branch lines from existing trunk lines began to be considered. In 1870 the first section of the Callander and Oban Railway was opened, extending a local branch line, and this railway, a subsidiary of the Caledonian Railway, opened throughout to Oban in 1880. Also in 1870 the main part of the Dingwall and Skye Railway opened, as far as Stromeferry. Thus two west coast locations were reached by penetrating branches from the centre. The Glasgow and North Western Railway There remained considerable tracts of the west Highland area without useful transport routes, and social conditions were identified as being unacceptable. A government commissionThe Napier Commission, The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the conditions of the Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. appointed in March 1883, examined the plight of smallholders in the Highlands, and their investigation showed that above all transport was a pressing need.As well as proposals on land tenure, the urged improved communication by post, telegraph, roads, steam vessels and railways, citing the precedent of state support for the Wade Military Roads and the Caledonian Canal. The Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886 established the Crofters' Commission and gave enhanced rights to crofters. This change of mood led to the idea that a railway serving the area was a social need, and in turn this led to the promotion of the Glasgow and North Western Railway. This 167 mile line, costed at ¬£1,526,116, was to reach from Glasgow (Maryhill) to Inverness by way of Loch Lomond, Rannoch Moor, Glen Coe and Fort William. Fort William, although a small town, was the centre of a wide area.John McGregor, The West Highland Railway -- Plans Politics and People, John Donald, Edinburgh, 2005, David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The G&NWR; was not directly established by government: it was sponsored by financial interests in London, and by the North British Railway (NBR). The NBR was a bitter competitor of the Caledonian Railway (CR) and the CR regarded the western side of Scotland as its own preserve, so that the NBR interest in the new line automatically led to opposition. The Highland Railway and David MacBrayne Ltd, a coastal steamer operator, were both effective monopolies on their respective businesses and naturally opposed the G&NWR.; The Bill came before Parliament in the 1883 session. The hearings were lengthy, and opposition counsel did not hesitate to pour scorn on Highlandmen who came in support of the line. The undeveloped nature of the area (which the railway was designed to rectify) was shown as a reason to reject the proposed line, and finally on 1 June 1883 the Committee threw out the Bill. The G&NWR; was finished. The West Highland Railway proposed The establishment of the Crofters' Commission followed this disaster, and social concern at the plight of the West Highland population was not diminished by the failure of the G&NWR; scheme. In October 1887 public opinion in Fort William begun to be mobilised when the Provost N B MacKenzie publicly argued for a Glasgow to Fort William line. Efforts were made to secure the support of the North British Railway and in February 1888 this was given, provided that the Government contributed ¬£300,000 to the scheme. The North British guaranteed ¬£150,000 if local subscriptions were inadequate, as well as guaranteeing 4.5% on the shares (by a complicated formula). At length the idea of a West Highland Railway was developed. This time it would not attempt to reach Inverness, but was to run from Craigendoran, on the North British Railway line to Helensburgh. It would run beside the Gare Loch (instead of the southern part of Loch Lomond) to Ardlui, Crianlarich, Rannoch Moor and Loch Treig to Fort William. A branch was to continue to Lochailort and the south-west to Roshven, a west coast sea port intended to give access to fishing vessels and island steamers. The truncated route passed over the estate of friendly landowners as far as Fort William, but west of that place matters were more feudal, and the Roshven extension was later abandoned in the face of their opposition. On 30 January 1889 seven gentlemen, including Robert McAlpine set out to walk from Spean Bridge to Rannoch Lodge, a distance of 40 miles across largely trackless terrain. The purpose was to examine the route, and to discuss the route of the line with Sir Robert Menzies. In extremely poor weather they set off, wearing city clothes, and a series of misjudgements nearly led to catastrophe for them.McGregor (page 56) refers to this as \\"a foolhardy expedition\\". This event was used in the Parliamentary hearings for the authorisation of the line to illustrate the remoteness of the proposed route. The projections on the earnings of the line were simply based on the receipts of the Callander and Oban line, grossed up for the longer mileage. The Highland Railway and the Caledonian Railway both opposed the line in Parliament, to protect their lines to Stromeferry and Oban respectively, but the West Highland Railway Bill obtained the Royal Assent on 12 August 1889. The Roshven extension was dropped and the authorised line was from Craigendoran to Fort William only. Immediately a further Bill was prepared for the 1890 session for certain deviations‚Äîone on Rannoch Moor was rejected in Parliament‚Äîand for an extension to Banavie Pier. This Bill was enacted as the West Highland Railway Act 1890.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15: North of Scotland, David & Charles (Publishers), Newton Abbot, 1989, Construction The first sod was dug on 23 October 1889The Story of the West Highland, published by the London and North Eastern Railway, 1944 (written anonymously by George Dow) and the contractor for the construction, Lucas and Aird, set about assembling the workforce for the construction. The exceptional remoteness of the area, and the scarcity of even basic roadways posed especial difficulties. The engineers were Formans and McCall. In August 1891 a major dispute arose between the contractors and the railway company, over the price to be paid for removing spoil; the contractor wanted a higher payment for the material containing boulders. The dispute went to Dumbarton Sheriff Court, where the case was found in favour of the railway company, but by now the workforce was largely dispersed. A negotiated settlement brought Lucas and Aird back to the site and work resumed in October 1891. There was still much to do, in particular the crossing of the boggy section of Rannoch Moor which had not yet been started, By the summer of 1893 the railway company was running out of capital, and it appeared that the work must cease, but one of the directors, Mr Renton, gave part of his personal fortune to save the scheme. In fact when the line was completed the total cost was said to be ¬£1.1 million. Opening Crianlarich station, Easter 1957The line was finally inspected by Major Marindin of the Board of Trade on 3 August 1894 (after some earlier visits) and on 7 August authority to open the line to passenger operation was received. Maximum speed was to be limited to 25 mph. Opinion had been expressed within the company that a limited opening to Gareloch at first would be preferable, but the politics of securing the Government support for the Mallaig line meant that no hesitation could be displayed.McGregor states that it was unprecedented to open a line of over 100 miles in a single action. Trains started running on that day, although a formal opening was arranged for Saturday 11 August by the wife of the chairman, William Hay, 10th Marquess of Tweeddale. The line ran from Craigendoran Junction to Fort William, with fifteen stations formed in the style of Swiss chalets. The line was single, with Saxby and Farmer tablet apparatus. There were three passenger trains each way, the first down and last up train conveying a through coach for Kings Cross via Edinburgh; one goods train ran each way daily. On 1 November 1894 the passenger service was reduced to two trains each way, the \\"winter\\" timetable. The rival Caledonian Railway introduced a London to Fort William service via Oban, with a steamer connection from there to Fort William, with throughout timings not far off the West Highland times. An attempt was made by the West Highland to operate a residential service from Arrochar to Craigendoran (three return journeys daily and 4 on Saturdays from 1959), there connecting with North British Railway trains to Glasgow, but the difficult location of the WHR stations, some distance from the communities they purported to serve, made this unattractive for daily travel. An attempt to generate goods traffic from Greenock (via steamer to Craigendoran) to Fort William was also unsuccessful because of a price disadvantage compared to throughout steamer transits. Rannoch station was at this time remote from public roads: the West Highland built a road eastward from the station to Loch Rannoch. (The road is now part of the B846 road. Kinlochleven was also inaccessible by public road at this time.) From 29 December 1894 through to 7 February 1895 blizzards of exceptional severity struck the area of the line, and many trains became marooned, as the line was blocked. Improved snow defences were subsequently erected, including the Cruach Rock snowshed. Banavie extension The 1890 Act for the West Highland Railway included a short branch line from a junction near Fort William to Banavie, at a location adjacent to the Caledonian Canal. This was duly completed and Banavie Pier railway station was opened on 1 June 1895, closing to passengers in 1939 and to freight in 1951. The line arched round to the north-east and there was a station, alongside the canal and some distance north-east of the present-day station. This location was near the head of the series of locks known as Neptune's Staircase by which the canal rises 20 m and a transfer siding adjacent to the canal needed to climb by a 1 in 24 gradient to reach a backshunt. Crianlarich connection It had always been intended to make a connecting line with the Callander and Oban line of the Caledonian Railway at Crianlarich, where the two lines crossed. The Caledonian Railway had earlier been suspicious of the motives of the North British Railway in this regard; the distance from Glasgow to Crianlarich was substantially shorter by the West Highland Railway and at the Parliamentary stage the West Highland Railway (seen as the creature of the NBR) had applied for running powers to Oban. The original design of the WHR station at Crianlarich would have allowed through running from Glasgow to Oban via the West Highland, but this was not implemented. The Caledonian Railway suggested a joint station that would have allowed both routes (from Stirling or from Helensburgh) access to both destinations (Oban and Fort William, and there was a proposal that passenger trains from Central Scotland by both routes should combine at Crianlarich and then divide with portions for both Oban and Fort William. Cattle and other traffic from Lochaber destined for Stirling and Perth were intended to be transferred, but the connection was not made ready until 20 December 1897 and in the meantime that traffic had to be routed via Glasgow. It was complained that this extra mileage was more profitable to the NBR. From 1962 until 1971 a Swindon-built cross-country DMU, normally used on the Aberdeen to Inverness main line, was transferred in the summer months to work a daily round trip from Glasgow Queen Street station to Oban via this connection.Scottish Region timetables for this period It was joined from late 1965 by all Glasgow to Oban trains, re-routed following closure of the Dunblane to Crianlarich route - initially by a landslide in Glen Ogle but officially from April 1966 Reshaping of British Railways by Richard Beeching, published in 1963as part of the so called Beeching cuts. Financial performance With no through trains to Oban and a very limited 'residential' traffic to Garelochhead, the income on which the finances of the line had been based were out of reach. The main line to Fort William opened during the summer season of 1894, but doing so had been expensive, involving excessive construction costs against the contractor's advice in the difficult winters of 1892-3 and 1893-4. Moreover, the Banavie branch would not open until the following year (1895) and total construction costs exceeded ¬£1 million, nearly double the estimate. By now the North British Railway was the banker for the West Highland, but some pretence of independence was retained, to avoid a repudiation of the financial support by the Treasury.McGregor, page 142 The total revenue of the West Highland Railway in 1896 was ¬£45,146. It climbed to ¬£69,626 in 1899 and eventually to ¬£92,260 in 1901 (), but it was always heavily loss-making; the losses were made up by the NBR. Quite apart from the NBR's obligations under the guarantee, loans had been granted to the WHR; by June 1902 the WHR owed ¬£1,206,463Donald G B Cattanach, Wieland of the North British Railway, unpublished manuscript, quoted in Ross. (). Extending to Mallaig Glenfinnan viaductAlthough on salt water, Fort William was too far from the open sea to be useful as a fishing base, and the idea of a westward extension was revived. Loch Nevis was considered an ideal location from the shipping point of view, but the intermediate land would have made railway construction exceptionally difficult, so the West Highland Railway reluctantly settled on Mallaig, less than 40 miles from Fort William. It was clearly unlikely that the extension could be profitable and the NBR (as the only viable private provider of the necessary capital) made it clear that it would only invest if Government subsidy were made available. A Treasury CommitteeSpecial Committee on the improvement of Railway Communication on the West Coast of Scotland. examined the possible railways‚Äînot just the Mallaig line‚Äîand recommended Government support for the line, although Mallaig \\"could only be recommended for want of a more favoured position being attainable.\\" The North British Railway had supported the first part of the West Highland Railway for commercial reasons, but it was now concerned that it would be expected to pick up the loss of the Mallaig extension, and it considered a loss to be inevitable. Nonetheless commitments had been given, and on 28 April 1892 the NBR agreed to work the extension of 50% of gross receipts, and that it would continue to support the line when the Government guarantee of 3% on capital over 25 or 30 years expired. Considerable negotiation with Government was necessary over a protracted period in regard to the subsidy, and the matter was badly affected by a change of Government, when the Liberal administration replaced the outgoing Conservative group. A last-minute attempt to get a West Highland (Banavie and Mallaig) Bill in Parliament for the 1893 session was finally refused by the House of Lords. A new Bill, the \\"West Highland Mallaig Extension Bill\\" went to the 1894 session. Authorisation for the subsidy required a quite separate Bill; this was the West Highland Railway (Guarantee) Bill, also in the 1894 session. It was contingent on the construction Bill being passed; satisfactory improvements to Mallaig Harbour had to be agreed, and NBR was to undertake to work the line for 50% of gross receipts in perpetuity. Mallaig stationThe Highland Railway opposed the Bill as it was about to extend from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh. The West Highland Railway (Mallaig Extension) Act passed on 31 July 1894, but the guarantee bill was thrown out; many MPs objected to a free gift to a railway company. However the scheme, aimed at developing a backward area of the country, had Government support and the Guarantee Bill was submitted to Parliament again in the 1895 and 1896 sessions and eventually it passed, on 14 August 1896. The Treasury guaranteed the shareholders 3% on ¬£260,000 of West Highland Railway (Mallaig Extension) capital and to make a grant of ¬£30,000 towards the ¬£45,000 cost of the pier at Mallaig; ratesLocal taxes normally assessed on the presumed rental value of buildings and other installations. were also to be held to the level of unimproved land. The first sod of the extension line was cut on 21 January 1897 at Corpach by Lady Margaret Cameron. The contractors were Robert McAlpine and Sons,Thomas and Turnock state (page 278) that \\"the original contractor [before McAlpine] was obliged to withdraw. and the engineers were Simpson and Wilson. Although the section from Banavie to the head of Loch Eil was easy, from there onwards the terrain was very difficult, a problem exacerbated by the remoteness and difficult access. Very hard rock was encountered and away from Loch Eil there was a considerable volume to penetrate. Steam-powered drilling equipment was difficult to bring to the locations and keep fuelled, and McAlpine used water turbines to provide compressed air power for drilling. The construction of the line actually cost ¬£540,000Dr T Timins BA, The Mallaig Extension of the West Highland Railway in the Railway Magazine May 1901 (). Although the rock was hard, it was shattered and fractured, making it unsuitable for conventional masonry construction in bridges and viaducts, and this led McAlpine to use mass concrete to build many bridges; at the time this was a revolutionary form of construction. Borrodale Burn bridge became the world's longest concrete span at 127 feet, and Glenfinnan Viaduct was a huge structure in concrete at 416 yards long with 21 arches. The Mallaig line continued from the existing Banavie branch; the junction (formerly Banavie Junction) near Fort William for the branch was renamed Mallaig Junction, and the point of divergence of the new line from the final section of the Banavie branch was named Banavie Junction. The original Banavie station was renamed Banavie Pier, and there was a new Banavie station on the through line. Operating from Mallaig Banavie swing bridgeThe first trains ran to and from Mallaig on 1 April 1901. In the first timetable there was a through carriage and a sleeper to and from Kings Cross, but this was not continued in subsequent years. Fish traffic was very important but it never reached the volumes hoped for; the harbour was difficult in certain conditions (which also limited the reliability of the Hebrides ferry service). The Mallaig site on land was also very restricted and gave rise to complaints from the fish merchants, and delays to punctual running because of difficulty loading trains. In addition, the fish traffic tended to arise in spurts, requiring extra trains and empty return workings. The area was a stronghold of conventional religious belief and the observance of the Sabbath was strictly enforced, also occasionally leading to difficulty in handling a perishable merchandise like fish. All in all the line was a serious loss-maker and never reached even the low expectations of it: in the thirteen years from 1901-2 to 1913-4 the line made a trading loss of ¬£72,672 and the Treasury contributed ¬£36,672. By 1914 private motoring had reduced railway income from the well-to- do estates, and bus services became real competitors in the 1920s.John McGregor, West Highland Extension: Great Railway Journeys Through Time, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, 2009, Absorbed by the North British Railway As time went on, the independence of the West Highland Railway was increasingly seen as a sham; its line was worked by the North British Railway, and its losses as well as any remaining capital works were funded by the NBR. Competing railways ‚Äî the Highland and the Caledonian ‚Äî could clearly see that the NBR was in control. In 1902 matters were brought to a head when the North British Railway (General Powers) Act abolished West Highland Railway stock and substituted 3% North British Railway stock. Six years later the North British Railway Confirmation Act, 1908, gave the NBR power to absorb the entire WHR undertaking, and this became effective on 31 December 1908. The West Highland Railway had a book value of ¬£2,370,000. Invergarry and Fort Augustus In 1895 an Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway was proposed: it was a truly local scheme for a line 24 miles in length, serving a district with almost no population. Although built as a single line railway, land was taken for double track, against the day when traffic developed so as to require that. Its Bill was submitted to Parliament in November 1895. There had long been suspicion between the Highland Railway and the North British Railway about presumed attempts to gain control of the Great Glen: the Highland might attempt to reach Fort William and demand running powers to Mallaig; or the North British might seek to reach Inverness and run from Glasgow via Spean Bridge. Such lines had indeed been proposed in past years. Even the Caledonian Railway might get control of the line and acquire running powers to Mallaig. The Highland Railway saw the Fort Augustus line as a way for the NBR to reach Inverness, whether or not the scheme was sponsored by the NBR, and the Highland opposed it in Parliament, but the line secured its authorising Act on 14 August 1896. This renewed open hostility between the NBR and the Highland Railway and both proposed new schemes for a line between Inverness and Fort Augustus. The Highland Railway appeared to be gaining Parliamentary support at first (in the 1897 session), but eventually both schemes were thrown out. The Fort Augustus line was built on a lavish scale, with magnificently decorated structures, through difficult terrain. Work began on constructing the line in 1897, but it was not until 22 July 1903 that the line opened. Contrary to expectation, it was the Highland Railway that operated the line at first; it was far detached from the Highland system, and the arrangement was a political gesture rather than a pragmatic commercial move. In fact the Highland Railway withdrew in 1908 and the North British Railway took over. The financial position of the line was hopeless and when cash injections from wealthy landowners dried up, the NBR withdrew its trains in October 1911. Following intervention from the County Council, trains resumed operation on 1 August 1913 and the NBR acquired the line on 30 August 1914. Passenger operation finally ceased on 1 December 1933 and the line closed completely on 31 December 1946. The twentieth century The West Highland Line of the North British Railway (as the WHR had become) settled down to a stable existence in the twentieth century, although continuing to lose money. In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" following the Railways Act 1921 and the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway. In turn this was schemed into British Railways, Scottish Region, when the railways were taken into state ownership in 1948. In 1924 work started on a huge hydro-electric power scheme which led to the establishment in 1929 of the Lochaber Aluminium Smelter near Fort William. The production of aluminium requires large quantities of electric power, and the decision on location of such a plant is driven by the availability of cheap power. Alcan took over the plant in 1981; the finished metal provided business for the line.Henry Hewlett (editor), Long-term Benefits and Performance of Dams: Proceedings of the 13th Conference of the British Dam Society, Thomas Telford, London, 2004, In 1931 the Lochaber power scheme was inaugurated; it required a diversion of nearly 1.5 miles of the line alongside Loch Treig; a dam was built across the northern end and the level of the loch was raised by about 35 feet. The diverted railway is from 78m 100yds to 80m 175yds, and includes a new tunnel 150 yards long. The long-standing lack of employment in the West Highlands once again prompted government intervention when in 1963 an Act of Parliament was passed under which a grant of ¬£8 million was made to Wiggins Teape to establish a pulp and paper mill at Corpach. This came on stream in 1966, and was known as Scottish Pulp and Paper Mills. The process requires plentiful timber and fresh water, and although the latter was freely available, in the longer term it proved difficult to obtain economically priced timber locally, and the plant was closed in 1991.Richard Leslie Hills, Papermaking in Britain 1488-1988: A Short History, Bloomsbury Academic Collections, London, 1988 revised 2105, In June 1975 Fort William station was relocated, shortening the line a little, in connection with a road scheme. In 1987 radio electronic token block (RETB) was installed on all of the West Highland Railway system, except for the Fort William station area. RETB enabled safe operation of the long single line sections without signalling staff at stations; the control centre was at Banavie. The points at passing loops at stations were spring operated, and were negotiated at slow speed in the facing direction. To avoid confusion in radio voice exchanges between drivers and the signallers at Banavie, Mallaig Junction was renamed Fort William Junction while Tyndrum Upper station was renamed Upper Tyndrum - both from late 1989.Information from former ScotRail Business Manager Highland 1986-91.

Seventeen sea wall sections were required between Corpach and Kinlocheil, as Loch Linnhe can be very rough in bad weather. There are eleven tunnels on this section, although originally only two were planned; the longest tunnel is 350 yards long, at Borrodale. There is a swing bridge at Banavie over the Caledonian Canal, and at Glenfinnan the concrete viaduct is 416 yards long on a 12-chain curve; there are 21 arch spans. There were 350 viaducts and underbridges and 50 overbridges on the Fort William section. The longest viaduct is on Rannoch Moor at 684 feet in nine spans of 70 feet 6 inches, partly on a 12 chain radius curve. On the Banavie branch the viaduct over the river Lochy, consisting of four 80 feet spans, required cast iron cylinders to be sunk for the founding of the piers. The Cruach snow shed, at 205 yards long, had a corrugated iron roof in three sections; in summer the centre section was removed; in 1944 it was said to be the only snow shed on a British railway. There was a level crossing with remotely operated gates about 150 yards from Fort William station. Originally it was manually operated but from 1927 it was electrically worked and controlled from Fort William signal box, a novelty at that time. The summit of the line is at Corrour, 1,347 feet above sea level.  Current status  Apart from the last section of the Banavie Branch, and several of the southern stations, the line is still open, being operated by Abellio ScotRail as part of the West Highland Line services (which also encompasses services to Oban and Mallaig).

Early life Silberman was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, then a part of the Regency Kingdom of Poland in a Jewish family. During World War II, Silberman survived Nazi concentration camps and eventually settled in Paris. Career One of his first works as a film producer was Jean-Pierre Melville's 1955 film Bob the Gambler, a precursor to the French New Wave movement. Silberman's most notable collaborations were with the surrealist film director Luis Bu√±uel. The pair, along with screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri√®re, who Silberman introduced to Bu√±uel, worked together on a number of films, starting with the 1964 film Diary of a Chambermaid. Silberman produced most of Bu√±uel's late films, including the Academy Award winner The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie in 1972 and the director's last film That Obscure Object of Desire in 1977. Silberman founded his own production company, Greenwich Film Productions, in 1966. The company was responsible for the production of over 15 films. In 1981, Silberman produced his most financially successful film, Jean-Jacques Beineix's Diva. The film was not well received in the country of its origin, France, but became a box-office hit abroad. The money gained from the movie enabled Silberman to provide funding for Akira Kurosawa's ambitious 1985 film Ran, which at the time of its making was the most expensive Japanese film ever.

It runs from west to east, starting at the Dutch border. On the border it connects with the Dutch A1 motorway, hence, the A 30 is part of the important European connection Berlin - Amsterdam. It is an important connection from Hannover and Minden to Osnabr√ºck, M√ºnster and the Netherlands, and part of European Route E 30. Course The A 30 starts as the continuation of the Dutch A1 motorway, at the Dutch border between Nordhorn and Bad Bentheim. In its course towards the east it first crosses Bundesautobahn 31 near Sch√ºttorf, offering connections towards the Ruhr area (south) and Emden (north). It passes Rheine and near Osnabr√ºck it crosses the A 1 and A 33, offering connections to the north in the direction of Bremen (A 1) and to the south in the direction of M√ºnster (A 1) and Bielefeld (A 33). About 50 kilometer farther to the east the A 30 ends in Bad Oeynhausen. Traffic continues over the Bundesstra√üe 61 through the health resort Bad Oeynhausen. After this town there is 1 additional kilometer of highway A 30, leading to the A 2. There the A 30 ends and continues as B 514.  History  The first plans for an international motorway were made in 1933 with the Netherlands. The road was to run along Oldenzaal, Bad Bentheim, Salzbergen and Rheine. The 1938-1940 German road network plans contained a road that would run to the south of Salzbergen, north of Rheine and south of Osnabr√ºck and would meet the A 2 near Herford and Bielefeld. In earlier plans the A 30 would run along Bundesstra√üe 65 to Hannover. However, these plans were abandoned. Merely the bypass of Stadthagen and the southern bypass of Minden (part of the B 65) and parts of a planned interchange in Laatzen remain as evidence of these earlier plans. If the A 30 had been further extended through Minden and Stadthagen to Hannover, then today's segment of the A 30 around Bad Oeynhausen would have had the number A 339. = Bad Oeynhausen Bypass = Planned routing of A30 in Bad Oeynhausen. The closing of the highway gap near Bad Oeynhausen has been planned for decades, however, it has not been executed up to now due to disputes about the location of the planned northern bypass of Bad Oeynhausen. In the city there are frequent traffic jams, and traffic (especially freight traffic) is expected to increase. Hence, the gap closure towards the A 2 is judged especially urgent. The government of the region Detmold has issued a planning decision for this last segment of the A 30 at the request of the North Rhine-Westphalian state company for road construction in January, 2007. The planned section is nearly 10 km long and the section should receive two new exits, 28 bridges and a tunnel. The citizens' group which exerts itself against the construction of the highway has submitted a complaint and an application for granting temporary legal protection against the planning decision before the Federal Administrative Court. In July 2008, the Court decided to reject the plaints against the planning decision. WDR news 9 July 2008 Road construction began in autumn 2008. The section of A 30 bypassing around Bad Oeynhausen opened to traffic on 9 December 2018.

They released a number of singles culminating in a compilation of their work, End of an Error (2004-2006). Members of Les Incompetents have gone on to form further bands, most notably Ox.Eagle.Lion.Man and Spector. History The band released their debut single \\"Re-union\\"/\\"Much Too Much\\" in summer 2005 through White Heat Recordings, which received national airplay. They were also highly rated by the record store Rough Trade, who listed \\"Reunion\\"/\\"Much Too Much\\" as their fourteenth favourite single of 2005. Their second single, \\"How It All Went Wrong\\", released in March 2006, was limited to 1,500 copies and sold out on the day of its release. The low budget music video was filmed by directors Type2Error at the Tatty Bogle Club in London, where the band rehearsed. The band were noted for their live shows and association with the Way Out West club in London. During their live career they supported, amongst others, Mystery Jets, Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster and Babyshambles. =Assault on Billy Leeson= On 22 June 2006, Les Incomp√©tents' frontman, Billy Leeson was involved in an argument with New Zealander peace activist, former Green Party candidate, Christiaan Briggs, after getting off a bus in Camden Road, Holloway, North London. According to news reports, this followed an argument on the bus after Leeson accused Briggs of looking at Leeson's girlfriend, Elli Bradshaw; Briggs followed the couple off the bus and then punched Leeson who then fell and hit his head on the ground. Two witnesses claim Briggs walked away \\"smirking\\", although Briggs' lawyers have claimed he was \\"smiling nervously\\". Leeson was in a coma, and listed in critical condition for three weeks following surgery to remove a piece of skull that was pushing into his brain, causing it to swell. He regained consciousness on 27 July and is now out of hospital, but requires a metal plate in his head. Briggs turned himself in to police when the extent of Leeson's injuries was reported in the news. Briggs was sentenced to eight months in prison on 23 October. Leeson does not remember the attack. =Split= On 1 September 2006, the band announced via a bulletin and blog-post on MySpace that they were splitting up. The news came just after their V Festival performance had been aired on Channel 4's Whatever programme. After selling out London's 100 Club on 7 November 2006, they played their final gig at Acton Town Hall on 11 November 2006. In March 2007, the band released End of an Error (2004-2006), a collection of all their recorded material, on White Heat Records, including singles, b-sides, early demos, an introduction featuring David Walliams and live performances from XFM sessions. =Post-split= In November 2007, a new band containing Paterson, Macpherson and Tommy Atomic of Ox.Eagle.Lion.Man released their debut single via the Transgressive Records. As of 2011, Macpherson and Burman are performing as members of Spector. Name According to the band, in an interview with John Kennedy on XFM, their name is pronounced as it is written, with the French plural for 'the' pronounced like the English name 'Les', as if it is a British person's attempt at speaking French. \\"It's meant to sound like an English person mispronouncing a French word/words. Or it's a man called Les, with the surname Incomp√©tents\\". The name is taken from a quote from the 1990 film Home Alone.

Born in Dinsmore, Saskatchewan to a prominent family (Harlo's father Luther Jones owned several businesses, including Dinsmore's first power plant), young Harlo was known by the nickname \\"Squirt\\" because of his small stature. His older brother, RCAF pilot Dale Jones, was shot down and killed in 1940 during the Battle of Dunkirk. Undeterred, Harlo was eager to join the RCAF as soon as he was of age. Refused twice at the Saskatoon recruiting center because of his small size, he was eventually accepted with a recorded weight of 118 pounds and a height of 5 feet, 10 inches. After training at various sites across Canada he was assigned to 408 Squadron of 6 RCAF Group, RAF Bomber Command at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire. Harlo flew Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax bombers in 32 sorties against targets in Germany and Occupied Europe. His final sortie was on December 5, 1944, just days before his 21st birthday. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, promoted to Flight Lieutenant, and released of his duties. He returned to Canada where he joined the Geological Survey of Canada, working with a crew in the bush north of Flin Flon, Manitoba. He married Ethel Cloake, a nurse, in 1946. He earned a Bachelor of Arts at the University of British Columbia and worked as a reporter for the Vancouver Sun, and later, the Edmonton Bulletin. He rejoined the RCAF in 1950 and served for another 20 years before managing a hospital in Winnipeg. Harlo published the first of his two memoirs in 1995. O Little Town: Remembering Life in a Prairie Village detailed his childhood in Dinsmore. Bomber Pilot: A Canadian Youth's War followed in 2001, in which he recounted his days as a bomber pilot in World War II.

It contains thirteen tracks released as singles, only one of which did not also appear on album, and six album tracks. Every one of the band's seven albums released by Arista during the time period indicated is represented here. Designed specifically for the American market, it peaked at No. 159 on the Billboard 200 and failed to chart in the United Kingdom. A version for compact disc was issued in 2000 by Koch Records. Liner notes are by John Swenson, and the original recordings were produced by Ray Davies. Content This album comprises a survey of the band's output during their second period of commercial success after their early hits of the mid-1960s, this success predominantly in the United States. After four low-selling concept albums for their previous label, RCA Records, their contract was not renewed. In 1976 they signed with a company recently launched by ex-Columbia Records head Clive Davis, Arista, making one live and six studio albums for the label during a stay of a decade. In an effort to reverse diminishing cash flow, the band jettisoned the horn players, back-up singers, and the theatricality of the mid-1970s work and embraced the arena rock styles of the period. Ray Davies decamped to New York and worked to write songs with the commercial American market in mind: > I started working with Clive. I think Sleepwalker was an attempt to make it > more palatable to radio and that's why Clive wanted to get involved. I was > working with him very closely in those days. I rented an apartment in New > York, and I would take my demo tapes into his office, he'd play the songs > and make comments, and I would go back and work on them.Davies as quoted in > the 2000 reissue liner notes, Koch Records Vel-79733. Of the songs on the album, \\"A Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy,\\" \\"Come Dancing,\\" and \\"Don't Forget to Dance\\" made the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, with two just missing at #41: \\"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\\" and \\"Do It Again.\\" Four consecutive albums covered by this compilation ‚Äî Low Budget, One for the Road, Give the People What They Want, and State of Confusion ‚Äî all placed in the top 15 on the Billboard 200.

The band was notable for using unusual acoustic instruments such as hammered dulcimers, Appalachian dulcimers, and tongue drums alongside more conventional instruments such as acoustic guitar and acoustic bass guitar. Their founder member and sole constant was Geoff Smith. Their lyrics, written by Smith, reflected a strong socialist political stance, especially on the early singles and the first album. Although the band were active at the height of Thatcherism, they did not participate in the more moderate Red Wedge collective. The band's first single, \\"Trojan Horse\\", featured Smith and Graham Barlow. Acoustic guitarist and backing vocalist Mark Allen joined and they released a 12\\" EP, \\"U.K.A. (United Kingdom of America)\\", the sleeve of which featured an endorsement from Billy Bragg. The band released their debut album, The Baby Within Us Marches On, in 1988. Barlow left after the release of the \\"I Don't Care How Long It Takes\\" single. Smith and Allen recorded the band's second and last album, Crystal Night, as a duo. The band's sound changed somewhat in this incarnation, with the heavily percussive sound of the trio line-up replaced by a mellower, folky feel. There was less emphasis on the tongue drums and more on the hammered dulcimer and Allen's guitar, which took on a markedly flamenco aspect. Smith's lyrics became less overtly political, and more concerned with love and personal relationships. The band split after the Crystal Night album. Smith continued as a solo performer and composer, creating music for film and dance. Allen is now a teacher, but has also continued to work as a singer and guitarist in a number of groups.

The company, which was formerly known as Swisscontrol, changed its name to skyguide (officially written lower-case) in 2001. Skyguide is a joint-stock company under Swiss private law which is responsible, on behalf of the Swiss Confederation, for ensuring the safety of all Swiss airspace and of adjoining airspace areas in Germany, Austria, France and Italy that have been delegated to its control. For Swiss airspace, this duty extends to both civil and military air navigation services. Skyguide is subject to the supervisory authority of the Swiss Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). Its principal shareholder is the Swiss Confederation, which holds 99.91% of its share capital. The company employs some 1,500 people, around two-thirds of them in the provision of air navigation services, a quarter in technical services and the rest mainly in administration. Alex Bristol, the current CEO, assumed his duties on 1 July 2017. Skyguide is headquartered in Meyrin, near Geneva Airport.  Skyguide in figures  Skyguide managed some 1,198,663 instrument flight rules (IFR) flights through its airspace in 2016 ‚Äì an average of around 3,285 flights a day ‚Äì and generated total annual operating revenue of over CHF 455 million. Switzerland's air navigation service provider currently employs some 1,500 personnel spread over 14 locations throughout the country. Two-thirds of them are in air navigation services, around a quarter are in technical functions and most of the rest hold administrative positions.Skyguide, Gesch√§ftsbericht 2016 .  Military tasks  Skyguide's most important partners are the Swiss Air Force. Switzerland's air policing and defence are the responsibility of the Swiss Air Force, which, with its primary radars, can also detect flying objects not emitting a transponder signal. Skyguide is unusual, however, in that in addition to its civil air traffic management role, the company also provides Switzerland's military air navigation services. Skyguide's military controllers have all completed their basic civil air traffic controller training. In addition, these controllers will also have had additional training for military airport operations or in tactical fighter control. Normally, they work as civilian employees alongside military personnel; but if required (e.g. for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos) they will perform duties within the military operation. Skyguide manages Swiss airspace dynamically together with the Swiss Air Force according to current military or civil needs. In some cases, skyguide's military controllers may also guide fighters in the so-called \\"cross-border areas\\" in France or Italy. So military airspace may also extend beyond national borders and be used by the air forces of the two countries concerned.  Innovation  Stripless: Since 2015 skyguide has adopted a harmonized stripless system at both its control centres (en-route & lower airspace sectors). The benefits here include increased heads-up time, shorter and safe handovers as well as providing voice traffic with additional digital support. Virtual Centre: In consolidating its air traffic control centres virtually (instead of physically, with all the latter's political, social and economic ramifications), skyguide is generating a new paradigm in air navigation services. The Virtual Centre model promises substantial benefits in terms of operational flexibility, business continuity and cost-effective technical evolution. Satellite-based navigation: The potential for further developing conventional navigation systems based on expensive terrestrial equipment is reaching its limits. So if flight procedures are to be further refined, new technologies are required. One such technology is satellite-based navigation, which offers more possibilities than conventional navigation systems and provides a promising foundation for innovative new approach and departure procedures. One of the key advantages of this new technology is the greater positional accuracy it provides. This in turn offers several further benefits, with the promise of more efficient air traffic handling, lower fuel consumption, fewer pollutant emissions and less noise, too. Solar Impulse: Skyguide actively supported the pioneering Solar Impulse venture in its round-the-world flight, providing air traffic services during test flights, aeronautical publications and a 24/7 helpdesk throughout both the voyage and the years leading up to it. Skyguide shares Solar Impulse's passion for a more sustainable aviation industry, and is proud to have served as a facilitator here.  Locations  Skyguide HQ Geneva Air Force HQ at Wangen Skyguide's main operating locations are its two operations centres, one next to D√ºbendorf Air Force Base in Wangen- Br√ºttisellen (near Zurich) and the other near Geneva Airport at Meyrin. The latter is also home to the company's administrative head office. The Wangen centre came into operation in February 2009. The centre is responsible for the airspace above German-speaking Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Western Austria and parts of Southern Germany. It is also home to the company's Aeronautical Information Services and to the Skyguide Training Center, which has two tower simulators and further facilities for the real-time training of air traffic controllers and other air navigation services personnel for both skyguide and foreign air navigation service providers. The premises also accommodate the peacetime operations centre and air surveillance center of the Swiss Air Force. Skyguide's Geneva centre is responsible for Western Swiss airspace, the airspace above the French Alps and part of Italian airspace on the border with France. Skyguide maintains further operations at Bern (Belp), Buochs, Grenchen, Lugano (Agno) and St. Gallen-Altenrhein regional airports, and at numerous all-military or joint civil/military airfields. These include Alpnach, D√ºbendorf, Emmen, Locarno, Meiringen, Payerne and Sion. At Les Eplatures regional airport, the air traffic services have been delegated to the airport operator. =Radar stations= Radar on L√§gern near Boppelsen Skyguide uses nine radar stations for civil air traffic control:B√ºro f√ºr Flugunfalluntersuchungen (BFU), Schlussbericht √ºber die Radarsysteme von Skyguide * Two own wide-ranging secondary radar stations, also referred to as ¬´en route¬ª- radar stations, with locations above the Zurich community Boppelsen on the Jura hillside L√§gern and on the La D√¥le * Wide-ranging secondary radar dates from the Swiss Air Force FLORAKO radar (\\"TG\\") in Ticino on Mt.Scopi -interdite .net, * Two own combined primary and secondary radar, also referred as ¬´Approach¬ª radar stations, at the airports of Geneva (in Cointrin) and Zurich (on the Klotener Holberg) for landing and take-off guidance. * Four foreign radar stations to complete the national radar coverage in Switzerland and to provide air traffic to neighboring air traffic controllers with locations in Cirfontaine and Nevers (France), Gosheim (Germany) and Monte Lesima (Italy).  Collaborations in Europe  Skyguide's partners are the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Eurocontrol (Europe's umbrella air navigation services organization) and the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO). Europe's airspace is highly fragmented today. The Single European Sky (SES) project of the European Commission is intended to harmonize the continent's air traffic management systems and, in doing so, enhance the efficiency of the overall airspace structure. And one prerequisite for this ‚Äì in addition to tailoring airways more closely to users' requirements rather than basing them on national borders ‚Äì is the creation of a series of large integrated airspace blocks. Skyguide is a member of Functional Airspace Block Europe Central (FABEC)[6], which controls some 55% of all the air traffic handled in Europe, or around 5.3 million flights a year. The six FABEC member states ‚Äì Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland ‚Äì signed the corresponding international agreement in December 2010, laying the legal foundation for the new airspace entity. Skyguide's main contribution to the defragmentation of European airspace, however, is its concept to consolidate existing air navigation centres into a virtual entity (the \\"Virtual Centre\\").  History  Skyguide traces its origins back to 1922, when, after the First World War had demonstrated the importance of telecommunications, Switzerland concluded an agreement with the Marconi company. Swiss subsidiary Marconi Radio AG was founded on 23 February of that year to develop wireless telegraphy. On 10 May 1928, the company name was changed to Radio Schweiz AG (RSAG) to emphasize its Swiss national character. And on 1 January 1931 the Swiss Confederation mandated Radio Schweiz to provide air navigation services in Switzerland. Up until the end of the Second World War, Radio Schweiz was primarily engaged in meeting the telegraphic communications needs of the Swiss Confederation. Only on 21 December 1948, after concluding an agreement under which the Confederation and the country's airports would bear the costs of air navigation services, did Radio Schweiz start to monitor Swiss airspace. On 1 January 1989, Radio Schweiz's air navigation activities were restructured and brought into the new Swisscontrol company, whose headquarters were in Bern. Swisscontrol was converted into a public limited company in 1996, and its headquarters were transferred from Bern to Geneva. At the beginning of 2001, military air navigation services, which had been provided separately until then, were also placed under the responsibility of Swisscontrol, which was renamed skyguide in the process. Skyguide thus became the first air navigation service provider in Europe to control the whole of its country's airspace. On 1 July 2002 a Tupolev Tu-154 of BAL Bashkirian Airlines of the Republic of Bashkortostan in Russia and a Boeing 757 of DHL Express collided at an altitude of 12,000 metres in skyguide-controlled Southern German airspace in the 2002 √úberlingen mid-air collision. 71 people died. Four skyguide employees were subsequently sentenced by a court. On 24 February 2004, Peter Nielsen, the air traffic controller who had been on duty at the time, was stabbed to death by Vitaly Kaloyev, who had lost his wife and two children in the accident. On 21 September 2005 skyguide became one of Europe's first air navigation service providers to be certificated companywide to the ISO 9001:2000 norm. In achieving this, skyguide also met the requirement for Single European Sky (SES) certification.[10] On 15 March 2006 skyguide was adjudged to have not met the requirements for operating a single control centre for Switzerland's upper airspace. The project concerned did, however, allow the management of Geneva upper airspace to be gradually made 'stripless' from 2005 onwards. Skyguide has since been pursuing the strategy of merging its two en-route centres into one virtual entity (the Virtual Centre). On 20 December 2006 the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) awarded skyguide its certification for the Single European Sky (SES). At the beginning of 2010 six states (including Switzerland) signed an international agreement legally establishing Functional Airspace Block Europe Central (FABEC) as part of Europe's endeavours to create a Single European Sky. On 29 August 2016, an F/A-18C of the Fliegerstaffel 17 crashed in the Susten Pass in central Switzerland during a training mission. The pilot was found dead.http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/f-a-18_swiss-fighter-jet- missing/42407206 As a cause, an incorrect altitude instruction of the Skyguide Controller in Tower Meiringen is assumed.

Shortly after the move, Richard co-founded the Cambridge Angels,http://cambridgeangels.com/ an angel investment group focusing on technology startups in the Cambridge region, with Robert Sansom in 2001. He retired from the Cambridge Angels in 2008. Richard was an active angel investor from 2001-2008. His first investment was in a Manchester based startup, Designer Servers, known as DSVR. Richard and the founders successfully exited from the company in 2004 when it was sold to the company that became Legend Communications, PLC. Also in 2001, Richard co-founded Library House with a group of entrepreneurs and angel investors from the Cambridge Cluster. Library House was founded as a buy-side research house focusing on technology startups and be-spoke analysis for venture capital firms. The financial downturn in 2008 led venture firms to reduce their investments in research forcing Library House into administration as another victim of the global downturn. Its database of transactions, which was the only database of European venture activity, was sold to Dow Jones.Library House In 2004, Richard co-founded Trutap, with David Whitewood, a mobile software company offering free text and interactive messaging across the internet, prior to the introduction of smart phones. Trutap received three rounds of funding from two investors, Tudor Investments and the Cambridge Angels. The company closed in good order and the remaining investment was returned to Investors after the company was unable to pivot with the introduction and success of the iPhone. In 2008, Richard founded School for Startups Ltd. Dragons' Den In late 2004, Richard was approached by the BBC to join a new reality TV show called Dragons' Den. Richard was joined by Peter Jones, Duncan Bannatyne, Rachel Elnaugh and Simon Woodroffe as the first 'Dragons'. Richard appeared on the first two series of the programme. He voluntarily stepped down after the end of the second series after accepting a position as a venture partner with the hedge fund Tudor Investments.

Allegations In January 2015, the Daily Mirror reported that Richard had been arrested on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl. Nick Dorman, Daily Mirror. Retrieved 18 January 2015 Richard strongly denied the allegations. On 7 September 2015, Richard was charged. He appeared before the City of London Magistrates' Court on 5 October and was bailed until his appearance at the Old Bailey in January 2016 for trial. On 25 January 2016, Richard appeared at the Old Bailey, where he admitted sexual activity did occur but said it was consensual, believing her to be 17 at the time. The court heard that the 13-year-old girl in question told Richard on a number of occasions that she was 17. On 29 January 2016, Richard was cleared of all offences brought against him.

Stanley Tucci and Richard Schiff appear in supporting roles. The film is loosely based on New York Daily News photographer Arthur \\"Weegee\\" Fellig, and some of the photos in the film were taken by Fellig. Plot In the 1940s, Leon \\"Bernzy\\" Bernstein is a freelance crime and street photographer for the New York City tabloids, dedicated to his vivid and realistic work and his unique ability to capture shots that nobody else can. He is very confident of his skills, declaring at one point, \\"Nobody does what I do. Nobody\\". With a police radio under the dashboard of his car and a makeshift darkroom in his trunk, he quickly races to the scene of horrific crimes and accidents in order to snap exclusive photographs. He is so good at his job that he becomes known affectionately as the \\"Great Bernzini\\". Bernzy meets a sultry widow, Kay Levitz, who owns a fancy nightclub. It seems the mob is muscling in on her due to some arrangement with her late husband. Kay asks if Bernzy could investigate an individual she considers troublesome. Generally unsuccessful with women, Bernzy agrees to help Kay, and he slowly begins to fall in love with her. After talking to his contacts, including journalist friend Arthur Nabler, he tracks down Kay's man, only to find him murdered. But when he calls the police, he becomes a suspect in the man's death. The police and the FBI are also very interested in this case. Bernstein makes a connection with a local gangster, Sal, uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war about illegal gas rationing, and the Federal government. His activities get Sal killed and place Bernzy's life in great danger as he waits in hiding at an Italian restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place. Cast * Joe Pesci as Leon \\"Bernzy\\" Bernstein * Barbara Hershey as Kay Levitz * Stanley Tucci as Sal * Jerry Adler as Arthur Nabler * Dominic Chianese as Spoleto * Richard Riehle as Officer O'Brien * Max Brooks as Teen at Thompson Street * Richard Schiff as Thompson Street Photographer * Christian Stolte as Ambulance Attendant * Jack Denbo as Photo Editor * Timothy Hendrickson as Richard Rineman * Del Close as H.R. Rineman * Lisa Christakis - as young bride with soldier husband Production Joe Pesci took this role right after his Oscar-winning performance in Goodfellas. It was an attempt to capitalize on his popularity at the time and help elevate Pesci from respected character actor to star status. Director and writer Howard Franklin was unable to secure the rights to Arthur \\"Weegee\\" Fellig's story. Franklin, then, wrote the story of a Weegee-like photographer who smokes cigars and he named him Leon \\"Bernzy\\" Bernstein. In the film, like Weegee, cops wonder if Bernzy uses a ouija board to snap his photographs and find the stories.Gallagher, Sean. Suite 101, film review. According to journalist Doug Trapp, Franklin was inspired to write the screenplay after seeing a show of Fellig's photos in the 1980s at the International Center of Photography in New York City. And Weegee did, in real life, have a \\"soul-mate\\" named Wilma Wilcox, who was the woman in charge of his estate. But, Franklin has always denied that the film was about their relationship.Trapp, Doug. Cincinnati CityBeat, Fellig article, July 24, 2002. As the film is loosely modelled on Weegee, but the story is not, several photographers' pictures, along with some by Weegee, stand in for his work, including those of Lisette Model, Mickey Pallas, Wilbert H. Blanche, Irving Haberman, Ray Platnick, Roger Smith and Charles Steinheimer. Director Franklin says he was looking for \\"edgy, modern, high-contrast 40's\\" lighting and compositions with the ‚Äústark, rather lurid effects of flash, which pick out the central subject while everything around falls off rapidly into darkness‚ÄùGoldberg, Vicki.

It was released on DVD on January 31, 2011 in the Universal Vault Series. Reception =Critical response= Chicago Sun-Times film critic, Roger Ebert, was especially complimentary of the film and of actor Joe Pesci, and wrote, \\"One of the best things about the movie is the way it shows us how seriously Bernzy takes his work. He doesn't talk about it. He does it, with that cigar stuck in his mug, leading the way with the big, ungainly Speed Graphic with the glass flashbulbs. In the movie's big scene of a mob assassination, he stares death in the face to get a great picture.\\"Ebert, Roger. The Chicago Sun-Times, film review, October 14, 1992. Ebert said the film made him \\"think\\" a little bit of Casablanca (1942). Time Out magazine liked the acting and the script, and wrote, \\"The main virtue of screenwriter Franklin's debut as director is Pesci's portrayal of Weegee, the famous low-life tabloid photographer of urban disaster, lightly concealed as Bernstein, 'The Great Bernzini'... good dialogue, nice period recreation, great performances.\\"Time Out Film Guide. Time Out-New York, film review. Last accessed: November 29, 2007. Desson Howe, film critic for The Washington Post wrote, \\"Public wants to be taken for an atmospheric film noir, full of intrigue, romance and street toughness. But it's all flash and no picture. Despite the usual quippy, perky performance from Pesci, as well as cinematographer Peter Suschitzky's moodily delineated images, the movie is superficial and unengaging. It's as if Life magazine decided to make an oldtime gangster movie.\\"Howe, Desson. The Washington Post, film review, October 16, 1992. Soundtrack The original score for the film was written and recorded by Jerry Goldsmith but he was replaced by Mark Isham at a late stage. As such, Isham had a lot of work to do and in a short time. He found working with director Franklin a wonderful and educational experience.Score Magazine interview with Mark Isham, by Miguel √Ångel Ord√≥√±ez and Pablo Nieto, 2005.

He was previously a member of the group Attacco Decente. He was a pupil at Varndean College from 1974. Smith is considered to be one of the world's leading players of the hammered dulcimer. In performance, he plays three custom-built prototype dulcimers sequentially - diatonic, chromatic and a microtonal model featuring 'fluid tuning', i.e. such that individual notes may be tuned at (by) precise microtonal intervals. Smith has also designed a revolutionary new addition to the piano - the microtonal tuning mechanism. This innovation enables the use of fluid tuning on the piano. Therefore, a diversity of bespoke tuning layouts can be explored and created separately for each composition, in contrast to the instrument being creatively limited to 'fixed tuning' and therefore the culturally predominant western chromatic octave. Smith's compositions include music for film and dance. His first major solo work was a new soundtrack to Robert Wiene's classic German silent expressionist film The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari. He has performed this soundtrack as a live accompaniment to the film on many occasions. His next project was a new soundtrack to FW Murnau's film Faust, followed by a new soundtrack to Benjamin Christensen's 1922 silent film H√§xan.Preview. Independent, 11 April 2007. Smith's soundtrack was included on a DVD of H√§xan released in 2007 by Tartan Films.

He founded, managed and captained the All-England Eleven. He has been described as \\"one of certain figures who, in the history of cricket, stand like milestones along the way\\". Clarke was born at Nottingham and died at Wandsworth in Surrey. In the late 1820s, he lost sight in one eye after being struck there by a fives ball on the court behind the Bell Inn in Nottingham. First-class career Clarke was originally a bricklayer by trade, but from his earnings as a bowler and an advantageous marriage he was able in 1837 to take up the traditional cricketer's trade of publican. He married Mary Chapman, the landlady of the Trent Bridge Inn, and they arranged for the land behind the inn to be made available. He opened the enclosed Trent Bridge cricket ground behind the inn and, from July 1840, it became the main venue for Nottinghamshire matches instead of the Forest racecourse, which was not enclosed.Birley, pp. 83, 367. A stand at Trent Bridge has been named after Clarke.History. Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club Clarke was a great spin bowler. He began his first-class career as roundarm bowling was being introduced but he decided to persist with the slow right-arm underarm leg-spin he had learned as a boy. In his career, he took 795 wickets at the outstanding average of 10.06 in 143 known first- class matches with a best analysis of 9/29. He took five wickets in an innings 82 times and ten wickets in a match 26 times. He was a moderate batsman, scoring first-class 2133 runs at an average of 10.35 with a highest score of 75. He took 55 catches.William Clarke. CricketArchive . Clarke played in the inaugural North v. South fixture at Lord's, this being his first appearance there.CricketArchive ‚Äì match scorecard.

Retrieved on 1 December 2008.CricketArchive ‚Äì match scorecard. Retrieved on 1 December 2008. Captaincy Besides his bowling, Clarke's greatest attribute was his captaincy and leadership. He was an astute tactician and perhaps the sport's first truly tactical captain who could \\"think out\\" the opposition by means of planned field positions and rotation of his bowlers. Taking the reins from Joseph Dennis, Clarke captained the old Nottingham town club from 1830 and automatically succeeded to the captaincy of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club when it was formed out of the town club in various stages between 1835 and 1840. The All-England Eleven In 1845, Clarke had become a ground bowler at Lord's as an MCC employee. Another ground bowler then was William Lillywhite. Clarke had a great season in 1845 and few batsmen could play him well.Birley, p.84. Although most MCC ground staff were satisfied with their pay, Clarke was not and in 1846 he decided to take matters into his own hands. In August 1846, when the MCC season finished, he formed the All-England Eleven (AEE) as a touring team of leading players to play matches at big city venues, mainly in the \\"unfashionable but prosperous\\" North of England.Birley, p.85. The team played three matches in 1846 against 22 of Sheffield, 18 of Manchester and 18 of Yorkshire. Clarke's team was indeed a top-class side worthy of its title and the matches in Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds were a huge success. Clarke's touring team continued for several years to showcase the best players of the day and the venture became very profitable, especially for the entrepreneurial Clarke, who was careful to pay his players more than MCC did to keep them interested. He kept the surplus for himself and became very wealthy. John Arlott wrote of him: \\"He was the first man to make a fortune out of cricket; he was, also, the first to see that a fortune was to be made out of it.\\"Arlott on Cricket, edited by David Rayvern Allen, Fontana/Collins, 1985 edition, , p40. Because of its strength, the AEE generally played sides composed of twenty-two men, though these odds were reduced when opposed to such sides as Sheffield, Manchester, some county teams and the rival United All-England Eleven.

It was renamed Qintex Ltd and came to prominence in 1986, collapsing five years later in 1991. Its main shareholder and Managing Director was Christopher Skase. Qintex was made up of several companies, including Qindex Limited, Qintex Australia, Qintex Entertainment, and Qintex Productions. At its peak, Qintex owned interests in Channel 7, Mirage Resorts, Hardy Brothers jewellery retail concern and a number of other businesses. Its headquarters was in Brisbane, Australia. History Christopher Skase and his partners established a company in 1975 that subsequently gained control of Qintex. He expanded the company substantially, initially into retail with investments in Hardy Bros and car dealer Nettlefolds. Qintex also expanded into property development. In 1984, Qintex bought TVQ-0, a Brisbane television station. Later Qintex purchased HSV-7 and ATN-7 from John Fairfax and Sons. In 1986, the company invested in an entertainment company named Qintex Entertainment (today Sonar Entertainment), formed by the merger of American studios Hal Roach Studios and Robert Halmi Incorporated. In 1989, the company was struggling to meet interest payments and sold a share in their Mirage Resorts for in excess of $433 million. Collapse The first signs of collapse showed in October 1989, when the American subsidiary filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after Qintex failed to provide financing for a debt payment. The Australian Stock Exchange suspended Qintex's stock shortly after when the company failed to respond to questions of its financial health. A month later, in November 1989, Qintex Ltd went into receivership with debts of over A$1.9 billion. The collapse happened just six weeks after the company lost a bid to acquire MGM/UA studios for A$1.5 billion. Its collapse was prompted by what was later seen as an excessive amount of debt in the business. This coincided with very high interest rates that prevailed in 1989. When the company missed interest payments and was not able to renegotiate its position with the Commonwealth Bank, the bank appointed a receiver to the company.

The film is English-language and includes subtitles in over 30 languages. Plot Elephants Dream full film An old man, Proog (voiced by Tygo Gernandt), guides the young Emo (voiced by Cas Jansen) through a giant surreal machine, in which the rooms have no clear transition to each other. After Proog saves Emo from flying plugs in a room consisting of a gigantic telephone switchboard, they run through a dark room filled with electrical cables and flee from a flock of bird-like robots. In the next room, Emo is tempted to answer a ringing phone, but Proog stops him and reveals a trap. The room is also occupied by a robot resembling a self- operating typewriter, which Emo appears to laugh at. The next room is a large abyss from which metal supports appear from below; Proog nimbly dances across the abyss on the supports, while Emo casually walks along and does not seem to notice the stilts supporting him. Proog explains to Emo that the machine is like clockwork and could destroy them both if one wrong move is made. The two enter an elevator that is catapulted through a series of apertures by a pair of mechanical slats. Proog instructs Emo to close his eyes as they ascend to an empty dark void. Proog asks Emo what he sees, and is pleased by Emo's reply that he sees nothing as they plunge rapidly into the next room. A projector creates an image of a door from which music emanates. Emo asks to go through the door, but Proog insists that it is unsafe, and presses a button within his cane to enclose them both in a smaller room. Proog asks Emo why he fails to recognize the beauty and perfection of the machine, to which Emo responds that the machine does not exist. Proog slaps Emo across the face, pushing the startled Emo to walk away. Emo mockingly imitates Proog's earlier tour to demonstrate the machine's absurdity and manifests the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Colossus of Rhodes, which threaten to destroy Proog's constructed world. Proog strikes Emo with his cane and renders him unconscious, causing Emo's creations to disappear. Proog desperately asserts to Emo that the machine exists. Production In May 2005, Ton Roosendaal announced the project. The primary piece of software used to create the film was Blender; other programs used in production include DrQueue, Inkscape, Seashore, Twisted, Verse, CinePaint, GIMP, OpenEXR, Reaktor, Subversion, Python, Ubuntu, GNOME, and KDE. All of the software, except Reaktor, was free and open-source. The project was jointly funded by the Blender Foundation and the Netherlands Media Art Institute. The Foundation raised much of the funding for the project by selling pre-orders of the DVD. Production began in September 2005, under the code-name Orange by a team of seven artists and animators from around the world. It was later named Machina, and then finally renamed to Elephants Dream in reference to a Dutch tradition whereby parents might abruptly end children's bedtime stories with the introduction of a sneezing elephant. The primary purpose of the project was to field test, develop and showcase the capabilities of Blender, demonstrating what can be done with the software in organizing and producing quality content for films. During the film's development, several new features (such as an integrated node-based compositor, hair and fur rendering, rewritten animation system and render pipeline, and many workflow tweaks and upgrades) were added to Blender specifically for the project. The bulk of computer processing power for rendering the film was donated by the BSU Xseed, a 2.1 TFLOPS Apple Xserve G5-based supercomputing cluster at Bowie State University. It reportedly took 125 days to render, consuming up to 2.8GB of memory for each frame. Elephants Dream was released on March 24, 2006.

The project was announced to the public in mid-September on BlenderNation, and premiered at the 2010 Blender Conference. The stereoscopic version was rendered in Digital Cinema Package (DCP) 2K flat resolution, with a slightly wider aspect format which required adjustment of the camera lens parameter in every shot. Many scenes in the original production files used flat 2D matte paintings which were integrated into the rendered images during the compositing phase. For the 3D production each matte painting had to be manipulated or entirely recreated into versions for each eye. Draxinger implemented a number of stereoscopic features in Blender to aid in the stereoscopic production process. However, these features were never merged into official versions of the Blender software.

It premiered at the Berlinale on 14 February 2006, and was first shown in the UK on Channel 4 on 9 March 2006. The following day it was the first film to be released simultaneously in cinemas, on DVD, and on the Internet. It was generally well received: Michael Winterbottom won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival, and the film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature at the Sundance Film Festival. The Times criticised Winterbottom for accepting the men's stated reasons for going to Afghanistan at a time of danger after the 9/11 attacks in the United States, as it was known as al-Qaeda and Taliban territory. Synopsis The film portrays the accounts of Ruhal Ahmed, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul (the 'Tipton Three');Channel 4: Michael Winterbottom on The Road To Guant√°namo three young British men from Tipton in the West Midlands, who are of Pakistani and Bangladeshi ancestry. It features both actors and portrayals of actions, historical footage, and interviews with the three men. They travelled to Pakistan in September 2001, just days after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., to attend a wedding of a friend of theirs. While staying at a mosque in Karachi, the three decided to take a trip to Afghanistan to see first-hand what was happening in the region. Mixed with interviews with the three men, and archive news footage from the period, the film portrays a dramatic account with actors of the three men's experiences: from their travels into Afghanistan to their capture and imprisonment. Travelling by van, Ruhal, Asif, and Shafiq, with two other friends, crossed the border in October 2001 just as US warplanes began attacking Taliban positions all over the country. They made it to Kandahar without incident, and later to the capital city of Kabul a few days later. After nearly a month of \\"lingering\\" aimlessly around Kabul, the Tipton Three decided to return to Pakistan. But through a combination of bad luck and the increasing chaos, the friends took the wrong bus, which travelled further into Afghanistan towards the north and the front-line fighting between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance rebels. The convoy of vehicles they were riding in was hit by an airstrike, and they were left wandering around the unfamiliar country. In mid- November, near the town of Baghlan, the three came across a group of Taliban fighters and asked to be taken to Pakistan. Shortly afterward, all of the men were captured by Northern Alliance soldiers. Imprisoned at a base at Mazar-e Sharif, the three were interrogated and discovered to be British citizens. As they had no luggage, money, passports or any kind of identification to support their stories, Ruhal, Asif, and Shafiq were transferred to the United States military. They were imprisoned in a US army stockade for a month with other prisoners, being regularly interrogated and occasionally beaten by US soldiers. In January 2002, the 'Tipton Three' were declared \\"enemy combatants\\" by the US military, and flown with dozens of other alleged Taliban and al- Qaeda fighters to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where they were held for the next two years. They were held in mostly solitary confinement without charge or legal representation. The film portrays several scenes depicting beatings during interrogation, the use of torture techniques such as stress positions, and attempts by the US Army to extract forced confessions of involvement with al- Qaeda and the Taliban. The isolation continued in Camp X-Ray and another camp. During two years they were subjected to more questioning by US Army and Central Intelligence Agency interrogators. In one incident, one US army guard at Camp X-Ray desecrated one prisoner's Qur'an by throwing it to the ground to incite a reaction from the rest of the prisoners. Ruhal witnessed a group of US soldiers severely beat up an unruly and mentally ill Arab prisoner for not obeying their orders. When Ruhal shouts out that the beatings violate the Geneva Conventions, the guards laugh and say those laws do not apply to enemy combatants. In 2004, the Tipton Three were released without charge. They were flown back to England where, one year later, they returned to Pakistan for the wedding they had planned to attend in the first place. (It had been postponed.)

To worm, parcel and serve a line is to apply a multi-layered protection against chafe and deterioration to standing rigging. It is a technique not usually used on modern small boats, but is found extensively on traditionally-rigged sailing ships. Worming, parcelling and serving ‚Äîreferred to collectively as \\"service\\"‚Äî is traditionally applied only to traditional twisted rope, either natural fiber or steel wire-rope, not the braided line almost exclusively used on modern vessels, but some traditional vessels now use modern high modulus braided lines (like Amsteel or AS-90) in place of wire rope (to save weight aloft) and serve the line to maintain the traditional appearance. It can be applied to the entire length of a line, such as a shroud, or selectively, to specific parts of a line, such as over the spliced ends of a stay, where the chafe on the middle section of the stay precludes complete protection.  Technique  = Worming = \\"Worming\\" the line is designed to fill in the channels (the cutlines) between the strands in order to keep water out and to allow tighter, smoother wrapping of the next layers by giving the rope a more cylindrical shape. Lengths of \\"small stuff\\" or string are led along the lay of the rope between the strands, following the twist so that they spiral round the main line. For larger lines, such as the natural (e.g. hemp) fiber rigging used on early vessels, \\"sister worming\\" could be built up from several different sizes of \\"small stuff\\", as was needed to fill in the typically larger cutlines of cable-laid hemp rope. In the days of hemp anchor cable, worming of chain was used, when anchoring on a rocky bottom, to protect the anchor cable from chafing through. This was not then covered with parcelling and serving, but is included here as a further example of the utility of the technique. On the rigging of modern small craft, where the cutlines are not so deep as to leave large gaps beneath the parcelling (where moisture can become trapped and corrosion occur), or to create a facetted surface (as opposed to a smooth, round surface), worming is often omitted from the process. = Parcelling = The line is then \\"parcelled\\" by wrapping it in a spiral fashion with long overlapping strips of thin canvas. This is wound from bottom to top, the edge of the progressing strip slightly overlapping the previous wrap to create a shingled effect, to prevent water from entering. Often the strips of canvas are either saturated with Stockholm tar as they are applied, or painted with tar after the parcelling is complete, immediately prior to the process of serving. The tar helps fill any remaining gaps in the cutlines as well as creating a waterproof seal over the line within. As with worming, parcelling is applied in the same direction as the twist of the line being covered. The rule is \\"worm and parcel with the lay; turn and serve the other way\\". When parcelling is used on modern small craft, friction tape or cotton athletic tape can be used for the purpose. On rare occasions, when parcelling is not to be served (e.g., for short term use to protect a line against chafe), it should be applied against the lay of the line, counter to that guiding rhyme. In these circumstances, the parcelling itself is filling the protective role that serving would do. = Serving = The outer layer of protection is formed of twine wrapped as tightly as possible around the line, each progressive turn of the twine laid as close as possible against the last, covering the line completely. Following the rhyme above, it should have course run against the lay of the rope; this alternation helps prevent sideways chafe from opening up the protection. Traditionally hemp \\"marline\\" was and still is used for service; on modern small craft three-strand nylon \\"seine twine\\" is often used. A serving board or serving mallet can be used to help get the outer twine as tight as possible. Despite the name (arising from its shape) the serving mallet is not used to hit anything; it forms a kind of guide and tensioning lever for applying the twine to the rope. = Tar = An optional final stage for the permanent protection of \\"served\\" rope is to paint the outer layer of twine with a mixture of tar, varnish and black paint. This needs renewing periodically, and going aloft to paint footropes, shrouds, stays, and other served rigging is one of the regular maintenance tasks on many tall ships. The tar, or \\"slush\\" is a mixture of Stockholm tar, boiled linseed oil, and Japan drier. Many \\"recipes\\" for slush exist, but the intent is always to allow a penetrating coat of preservative pine tar that then cures to a harder finish that will not so easily rub off on sails and crew. The term \\"slush\\" is also used to describe the grease applied to the masts to lubricate the parrels so that the yards can raise and lower freely.  References  * Chapman, C.

The Thames Ditton Lawn Tennis Club is a lawn tennis club in Thames Ditton, Surrey, England. It was established in 1882, nine years after the official rules of lawn tennis were laid down. It is the oldest lawn tennis club still on its original site. Long after most clubs have replaced grass with various types of all-weather surface, Thames Ditton retains six outstanding grass courts and four newly installed artificial clay courts. Legal history In the late 1990s, as the lease of the land on which the Club plays came to an end, the survival of the TDLTC came under threat. The owner of the freehold wanted to sell the site to a residential developer. A question was raised in the House of Commons about the vulnerability of sports clubs to greedy developers: Hansard. The case entered the legal textbooks as Coppin v Bruce-Smith (1998) EGCS 55 (CA). Briefly: In Coppin- Smith, the premises comprised Thames Ditton Lawn Tennis Club, which included ten tennis courts and a pavilion, together covering over . The tenants, the trustees of the club, served a s26 request on the landlord, who served a counter-notice stating that he would resist a new lease on ground. Before the hearing, the landlord applied for planning permission for the site, which was refused on the ground of the loss of a recreational open space. The landlord then decided to demolish the buildings and courts on the basis that this would make it easier in the future to obtain planning consent. At the hearing, the Court of Appeal had to consider whether the landlord had established a 'reasonable prospect' of success (using the test in Cadogan). The landlord's expert gave evidence that the proposed demolition could be carried out without planning permission. The Court of Appeal considered whether this was correct in the light of the 1995 direction that planning consent for demolition is required only for dwelling houses. It decided that, contrary to the landlord's expert's view, planning permission would be required as the works were more aptly described as engineering works than demolition works. It was agreed that the landlord would encounter the same objection as previously when applying for planning permission. Accordingly, it held that the landlord could not show the necessary firm and settled intention to demolish the premises and was unable to resist the tenant's application for a new lease.

His business interests include hotels, health clubs, spas, media, TV, and property. He is most famous for his appearance as a business angel on the BBC programme Dragons' Den. He was appointed an OBE for his contribution to charity. He has written seven books. Early life Bannatyne was born in Dalmuir west of Glasgow. His father Bill had served in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in World War II and worked on the Burma Railway after being captured by the Japanese following the Fall of Singapore, he then worked in the foundry at the Clydebank Singer plant. As a child Duncan lived in one room with his parents and siblings in a large house shared with six other families. He attended Dalmuir Primary School where he displayed a talent for arithmetic and won a place at Clydebank High School after passing the Eleven plus exam. Most pupils owned a bicycle so he resolved to earn the money to buy one for himself. The local newsagent was not interested in employing him so she challenged him to find 100 new customers in return for a paper round. He called her bluff by returning with 100 names, but later reflected that it would have been more entrepreneurial to have sold the list. He only enjoyed PE and woodwork at the High School and left at 15 without any qualifications. In 1964, after a few weeks working for a local cabinet-maker he joined the Royal Navy, initially enlisting for twelve years as a junior second class engineering mechanic (stoker) at RNTE Shotley near Ipswich, better known as the boys' training establishment HMS Ganges. He served in the Navy for several years including a spell on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, before throwing an officer off a boat landing jetty in Scotland and receiving a dishonourable discharge. In his autobiography he claims this was in part a reaction to this officer's abuse of his authority, in part a dare by his shipmates and in part a way of getting out of the Navy, with which he had become disillusioned. Bannatyne was nineteen when this happened. After the incident he had to serve nine months in Colchester military detention centre. He later spent ten days in Glasgow's Barlinnie prison for not paying a ¬£10 fine in relation to a charge of breach of the peace and resisting arrest. Career Bannatyne spent his twenties moving from one job to another. Upon his return to Clydebank he trained as an agricultural vehicle fitter and then travelled around the country repairing tractors. He lived on the island of Jersey for four years from 1974 where he gained an HGV licence and earned a living through several jobs including deckchair attendant, ice cream seller and hospital porter. He also surfed, partied and met his first wife on the island. With Jersey's difficult business climate for outsiders, at age 29, Bannatyne and his wife moved to Stockton-on-Tees in North East England. He has stated that he was poor and did not have a bank account until the age of 30.Direct quote from Bannatyne from Dragon's Den, 14 July 2010. BBC. Retrieved 28 March 2012. His business career began almost immediately after his move to Stockton-on-Tees with an ice cream van purchased for ¬£450. He soon expanded by buying more vans during the period of the Glasgow Ice Cream Wars. He sold the business for ¬£28,000, founding a nursing home business called Quality Care Homes which he then sold for ¬£26 million in 1997 and children's nursery chain Just Learning for ¬£12 million. The Just Learning chief executive during the 1992‚Äì97 period was Michael Fallon while out of office as an MP. Bannatyne has since expanded into health clubs, with the Bannatyne Health Club & Spa chain to his name, and also hotels and property.

After the defeat of General John Burgoyne at Saratoga, the family fled north. Jones spent much of the following years treating wounded loyalist soldiers. After the war, he settled in Augusta Township. In 1788, he became surgeon for the local militia and, in 1794, was clerk for the land board in the Eastern District. In 1796, Jones was elected to the 2nd Parliament of Upper Canada for Leeds and Frontenac and was also appointed justice of the peace in the district. In 1800, he became a judge in the court for the Johnstown District. When serving as a judge he had his own son appointed as his court clerk. His sons were educated at the school in Cornwall run by John Strachan and he helped Strachan in establish the Church of England in the area.

Morningstar held many jobs throughout his career in the research and development of technology and programs. Most notably was Morningstar's role as project leader for Lucasfilm's Habitat, the first large- scale virtual multiuser environment. In March 2001, Morningstar and colleague Randy Farmer were awarded the inaugural \\"First Penguin Award\\" by the International Game Developers Association for their work on Habitat. He also participated in Project Xanadu, for which the word hypertext was first coined. Additionally, he is credited with coining the term avatar for an on-screen representation and pre-Internet work in online information marketplaces.  Early life and education  He graduated from University of Michigan in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering. While at the University of Michigan he performed research in the Space Physics Research Laboratory, where he wrote device drivers and CAD software for electronic circuitry. Chip Morningstar started his career as a research assistant at the University of Michigan and as an independent computer consultant. His original major was Aerospace at the University of Michigan. After his summer job in 1977 where he was surrounded by up to date computer technology, he changed his major to computer engineering. In 1979, he took a job at the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) as a research engineer. While at ERIM he developed image processing software, languages and tools for the Cytocomputer. Morningstar also co-invented the Leonard-Morningstar image filter algorithm. Career From 1984 to 1992, Chip Morningstar worked at Lucasfilm, Ltd. as a designer and programmer, as well as cyberspace consultant. While at Lucasfilm, Morningstar held the position of Project Leader for Habitat, an early graphical online multiplayer environment. Morningstar oversaw all development staff, as well as writing substantial portions of the server system himself. Use of the term ‚Äúavatar‚Äù for a human being's representative in a game world originated in Habitat, in Hindu belief, the word refers to a deity's Earthly incarnation. Presenting at the Second International Conference on Cyberspace in 1991, Morningstar and Randy Farmer found themselves bemused by the seemingly impenetrable postmodern \\"lit crit\\" of some academic speakers. They revised their paper, \\"Cyberspace Colonies\\", to feature a parody of this phraseology, and presented it on the second day of the conference. Morningstar subsequently published an essay on the topic, \\"How to Deconstruct Almost Anything\\", which has been described as \\"a wonderful cutting-through of academic weed to find the ideas that flower at the center of post-modernism\\". Morningstar worked on The Palace, the world's largest graphical chat system. He was also worked on Project Xanadu, the first distributed hypertext system which was initially started in 1960. Morningstar continued to work for various companies, such as American Information Exchange Corporation, Electric Communities, and Avistar Communications. In 2005, he took a job working for Yahoo!. At Yahoo! Morningstar was the principal architect and development team leader for the Yahoo! Core Identity Platform (CoreID). CoreID is a system that provides a framework for the storage and retrieval for all users of Yahoo!. He was also a team leader of the Yahoo! Reputation Platform, as well as a member of Yahoo!'s Social Media advisory program. Morningstar began working for MSB associates in 2009 and still works there as of 2011. The legal work that he is involved in deals with patents. Honors and recognitions In March, 2001, Morningstar and his colleague Randy Farmer were awarded the First Penguin Award by the International Game Developers Association for their work on Lucasfilm's Habitat.

In the 12th century the wooden parish church of Upton was replaced with a flint building. The tower and outside walls of the Norman building form part of the present church. Several of the walls are built of puddingstone. Two other Norman features survive: the ancient baptismal font and a piscina. In the English Reformation many of the ancient decorations were mutilated. A 13th-century Italian allegorical image of the Trinity ‚Äì God Father, Son and Holy Spirit ‚Äì survived and was reassembled in the restoration of the church. Dereliction and restoration By the early 19th century St Laurence's had fallen into such disrepair that it was decided to build a new church, St Mary‚Äôs, in the town centre. The Norman building was saved from demolition by a local farmer who secured the outside walls and tower. Saint Laurence‚Äôs was restored in 1850‚Äì51 by Benjamin FerreyBritish Listed Buildings and rededicated on 2 December 1851. Notable associations with the church The churchyard may have inspired the 1751 Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard by local poet Thomas Gray (1716‚Äì71). St Laurence‚Äôs \\"ivy- mantled tow‚Äôr\\" was a well-known landmark housing a curfew bell that \\"tolls the knell of parting day\\" across the fields of Eton College. The astronomer and composer Sir William Herschel (1738‚Äì1822), discoverer of Uranus, is buried at St Laurence's. He, his wife and his grandson are all interred in a family vault at the base of the tower, and there are commemorative plaques on the wall nearby. In 2001 a generous bequest allowed St Laurence's to install a set of stained-glass windows to commemorate Herschel and his discovery. The west window of the church is a memorial to John Sullivan (1788‚Äì1855), who is buried in the churchyard. He was the Collector of Coimbatore, India, between 1815 and 1830, and is best known as the founder of the city of Ooty.

Succeeding George, Duke of Saxony, a fervent Catholic who sought to extinguish Lutheranism by any means possible, Henry established the Lutheran church as the state religion in his domains. Biography Henry was the second son of Albert, Duke of Saxony, and his wife Sidonie Podiebrad, princess of Bohemia. When Albert died in 1500, his eldest son George succeeded to the Duchy of Saxony, and Henry became Lord of Friesland. Saxon rule of Friesland was disturbed by constant revolts. Consequently, Henry, who was of a rather inert disposition, gave up his title there. In 1505 Henry ceded Friesland to George, in return for an annuity and the districts of Wolkenstein and Freiberg, where Henry made his residence. In 1517, Martin Luther posted the Ninety-five Theses which sparked the Reformation in Germany, and a few years later Henry adopted the Evangelical faith. George remained a devout Catholic. Only two of George's sons survived to adulthood, John and Frederick, but they both predeceased him without issue. When Frederick died in 1539, the Lutheran Henry became heir presumptive to the Duchy under the Act of Settlement of 1499. To prevent a Protestant succession, George tried to override his father's will, disinherit Henry, and bequeath the Duchy to Ferdinand, brother of Charles V. However, George died only two months later, and Henry succeeded to the Duchy aged 66. He made Lutheranism the state religion of the Duchy of Saxony but reigned for only two years.

The cemetery is located at 515 South Market Street and is operated by the Mount Olivet Cemetery Company, Inc. History On October 4, 1852, a group of citizens from Maryland, including Charles Edward Trail, founded the Mount Olivet Cemetery Company. The company purchased 32 acres of land, which was designed by James Belden to incorporate walkways and driveways throughout the grounds. The cemetery was conceived primarily to provide several of the downtown Frederick churches more room for interments, after their cemeteries became full. Over time some of these smaller cemeteries were also relocated to Mount Olivet. One of the landmarks of Frederick, the episcopal graveyard, a family burying ground of some of the most famous personages of Maryland, was yesterday sold to G. L. Hughes. The plot where until about two years ago the first Governor of Maryland, Governor Thomas Johnson, rested, will soon be utilized for commercial purposes. All bodies were moved from the graveyard nearly two years ago to Mt. Olivet Cemetery.<\\"FNP 11/23/1915\\" /< Initial shares were sold for US$20 with the intention that after the cemetery was laid out that each share would be exchanged for 12 grave lots. The cemetery was formally established (chartered) in 1854. Mrs. Ann Crawford was the first interment at the cemetery; she was buried on May 28, 1854. Notable monuments and markers Mount Olivet Cemetery has had many monuments constructed on the grounds since its establishment. These monuments honor significant historical people, events and the men and women who fought in many of the military conflicts the United States has been involved in. Monument to the Unknown Confederate Soldiers. =Monument to the Unknown Confederate Soldiers= On August 7, 1879, a meeting was held to organize a group called the Ladies Monumental Association of Frederick County, whose purpose it was to raise the funds needed to erect a monument to the 408 ‚Äòunknown‚Äô deceased Confederate soldiers interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery.Scharf, Thomas.History of Western Maryland, being a history of Frederick, Montgomery, Carrol, Washington, Allegany and Garrett Counties including Biographical Sketches of their Representative Men, pp. 550‚Äì551. Clearfield Company & Willow Bend Books, Baltimore 2003. The monument was unveiled on June 2, 1881, to honor the soldiers of the Confederate army who fell in battles of the Civil War and who are buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery. The monument was 15 feet tall. The statue of the Confederate soldier was created in Italy of Carrara marble and stood upon a base made of granite. The inscriptions read as follows: The statue was toppled, beheaded and splattered in red paint in June of 2020. At the time caretakers said it was unlikely they'd be able to repair it. A week earlier, the cemetery had removed the Confederate flag that flew next to it. =United States Civil War Children‚Äôs Memorial= Children played a large role in the civil war as soldiers, drummers, scouts and nurses among other things. It has been estimated that 5% of the soldiers who fought in the Civil War were under the age of 18. This marker, erected in 1881, is \\"dedicated to the memory of the children who served and died in the civil war 1861-1865\\". The 1898 monument to Francis Scott Key below which he and his wife are interred. =Francis Scott Key Memorial Monument= The Francis Scott Key Memorial Association commissioned the American sculptor Alexander Doyle to create a monument suitable for the author of the national anthem of the United States. On August 9, 1898, Julia McHenry Howard unveiled the monument of her grandfather and author of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\", Francis Scott Key. Key and his wife, Mary Taylor Key, were relocated from the Key family plot, also at Mount Olivet Cemetery, to a crypt located in the foundation of the monument. Key is represented in a 9-foot bronze statue atop a 15-foot pedestal. A statue of Columbia, the goddess of patriotism, is located on the front of the pedestal. Columbia is flanked by an adolescent boy representing war on her left, and a young boy representing music on her right. This representation depicts the moment that inspired the poem \\"Defence of Fort McHenry\\" which he wrote after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy ships in Chesapeake Bay during the Battle of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812. The poem would eventually be set to the tune of \\"To Anacreon in Heaven\\" and become the national anthem of the United States. =Barbara Fritchie Memorial= Erected by the Barbara Fritchie Memorial Association in September 1914, it was unveiled as part of the ceremonies of the Star Spangled Banner Centenary. The monument is a large granite obelisk bearing a tablet containing John Greenleaf Whittier's 1863 poem \\"Barbara Fritchie\\". Above the tablet is a medallion created by the New York City sculptor James E. Kelly that depicts Fritchies profile, executed from an old time photograph, in front of a waving American flag. Fritchie, the subject of John Greenleaf Whittier‚Äôs poem, patriotically defied Stonewall Jackson and his Confederate Army as they marched past her Frederick home on September 10, 1862. The poem was very popular in the north but she would never know the notoriety she had achieved, because she had died a year earlier at the age of 96.

It was formerly treated as a race of the crimson- fronted barbet (Psilopogon rubricapillus). It overlaps in some places with the range of the coppersmith barbet (Psilopogon haemacephala) and has a similar but more rapid call. Description Cotigao NP, Goa, India Nov 1997 This species can be told apart from the coppersmith barbet by the crimson face and throat. The call notes are more rapidly delivered than in the other species. Distribution and habitat This species is found in the Western Ghats from around Goa south to southern Kerala in moist evergreen forest mainly below 1200 m elevation. They are also found in coffee estates. They often visit fruiting Ficus species, joining flocks of green pigeon and mynas. Behaviour and ecology Adult on an Erythrina These birds are usually seen in pairs during the breeding season but are gregarious in the non-breeding season. In flight, their straight and rapid flight can resemble that of lorikeets. The breeding season is mainly February‚ÄìMarch prior to the rains. The nest hole is excavated on the underside of thin branches. It takes about 18 days to excavate the nest. These nest holes are often destroyed by larger barbets that may attempt to enlarge the hole. A nest is made each year. Multiple holes may be made and any extra hole may be used for roosting. Two eggs are laid in a clutch. They are incubated for 14 to 15 days. Eggs may be preyed upon by palm squirrels (Funambulus sp.) and they are usually chased away by the adult birds. Unhatched eggs are removed by the parents. For the first week the chicks are fed insects after which they are fed fruits. The chicks fledge in about 35 days. The species feeds mainly on fruits but sometimes takes grubs, termites (flycatching at emerging swarms of alates), ants and small caterpillars. In Kerala, the fruiting trees were limited mainly to Ficus species, especially Ficus retusa, Ficus gibbosa and Ficus tsiela. When feeding on small fruits, they tend to perch and peck rather than to swallow the fruit whole. In the non-breeding season, they join mixed-species foraging flocks.

Sree Venugopala Krishna Swami Dewasthan was established in 1900 at Chennamangalam (earlier known as Jayantha mangalam), 42 km from Ernakulam, 22 km from Aluva and 5 km from North Parur. Its main deity is Venugopalakrishna Swamy, and its main idol is Shila Vigrah of Venugopalakrishna Swamy. It also contains an Utsav idol of the Lord and the idols of Garuda and Hanuman at his feet. The temple celebrates a six-day-long annual festival in the month of Vaisakh. Temple history Those Gaud Saraswat Brahmins (GSB's) settled in Cochin spread to neighbouring suburbs and villages. Some families came and settled in Chennamangalam. Since they did not have any place of worship in the village, they had to visit the nearest temple at North Parur by foot for spiritual needs. To remedy the situation, they joined together under Chennoth parambil Sri Dasa Prabhu and started efforts to establish a temple. They approached the Paliayam Valiyachan of the Paliyam Swaroopam and requested help. He donated the land for construction of temple. With the liberal donations from local mahajans, the temple was constructed, and the Pratishta made on 30 April 1900. Twelve community members under the leadership of Chennoth parambil Ramachandra Prabhu started a Chitty in 1920. The generated profit was used to acquire land for the temple to meet the daily expenses. Later, in 1956, the children of Chennoth parambil Sri Dasa Prabhu formed an Endowment Trust in his name and donated 10 acres of land and Rs. 65,000 to temple on behalf of the trust. In due course, necessary constructions such as Agrasala, Anapandal, etc. were made. The temple was renovated in 1995 and the Srikovil was covered with Copper plate. Srimat Sudheendra Tirtha Swamiji had his Chaturmasya Vrita at this temple in 1973. At present there are about 100 GSB families in Chennamangalam.

A Christian burial is the burial of a deceased person with specifically Christian rites; typically, in consecrated ground. Until recent times Christians generally objected to cremation because it interfered with the concept of the resurrection of a corpse, and practiced inhumation almost exclusively. Today this opposition has all but vanished among Protestants and Catholics alike, and this is rapidly becoming more common, although Eastern Orthodox Churches still mostly forbid exhumation. History and antecedents of Christian burial rites =Early historical evidence= Fourth-century Christian burial depicted in relief at the Shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Milan. Among the Greeks and Romans, both cremation and burial were practiced. However, the Jews buried their dead. Even God himself is depicted in the Torah as performing burial: \\"And [God] buried him (Moses) in the depression in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor. No man knows the place that he was buried, even to this day.\\" (Deuteronomy 34:6). Early Christians used only burial, as can be demonstrated from the direct testimony of TertullianTertullian, De Corona (in Migne, Patrologia Latina [P.L.], II, 92, 795); cf. Minucius Felix, Octavius, xi (P.L., III, 266) and from the stress laid upon the analogy between the resurrection of the body and the Resurrection of Christ ().cf. Tertullian, De Anim√¢, LV; St. Augustine, De civitate Dei, I, 13 In the light of the dogma of the resurrection of the body as well as of Jewish tradition,Cf. Tobit 1:21; 12:12; Sirach 38:16; 2 Maccabees 12:39 the burial of the mortal remains of the Christian dead has always been regarded as an act of religious import. It is surrounded at all times with some measure of religious ceremony. Little is known with regard to the burial of the dead in the early Christian centuries. Early Christians did practice the use of an Ossuary to store the skeletal remains of those saints at rest in Christ. This practice likely came from the use of the same among Second Temple Jews. Other early Christians likely followed the national customs of the people among whom they lived, as long as they were not directly idolatrous. St. Jerome, in his account of the death of St. Paul the Hermit, speaks of the singing of hymns and psalms while the body is carried to the grave as an observance belonging to ancient Christian tradition. Several historical writings indicate that in the fourth and fifth centuries, the offering of the Eucharist was an essential feature in the last solemn rites. These writings include: St. Gregory of Nyssa‚Äôs detailed description of the funeral of St. Macrina, St. Augustine‚Äôs references to his mother St. Monica, the Apostolic Constitutions (Book VII), and the Celestial Hierarchy of Dionysius the Areopagite. Probably the earliest detailed account of funeral ceremonial which has been preserved to us is to be found in the Spanish Ordinals of the latter part of the seventh century. Recorded in the writing is a description of \\"the Order of what the clerics of any city ought to do when their bishop falls into a mortal sickness.\\" It details the steps of ringing church bells, reciting psalms, and cleaning and dressing the body. 15th-century monastic funeral procession entering Old St. Paul's Cathedral, London. The coffin is covered by a blue and gold pall, and the grave is being dug in the foreground. Traditionally, the Christian Church opposed the practice of cremation by its members. While involving no necessary contradiction of any article of faith, it is opposed alike to ancient canon law and to the usages (praxis) of antiquity. Burial was always preferred as the method of disposition inherited from Judaism and the example of Jesus' burial in the tomb. During times of persecution, pagan authorities erroneously thought they could destroy the martyrs' hope of resurrection by cremating their remains. Though the church always taught that the destruction of the earthly remains posed no threat to the bodily resurrection,Marcus Minucius Felix, Octavius (P.L., III, 362) many Christians risked their lives to prevent this desecration of the relics of the saints. Furthermore, the bodies of Christians were considered to have been sanctified by baptism and the reception of the sacraments, and thus were to be treated with dignity and respect, as befits a \\"Temple of the Holy Spirit\\" (, ). In reaction against the Christian opposition to cremation some have deliberately instructed that their remains be cremated as a public profession of irreligion and materialism. The revival of cremation in modern times has prompted a revision of this opposition by many Christian churches, though some groups continue to discourage the practice, provided there is no intent of apostasy or sacrilege. During the Middle Ages a practice arose among the aristocracy that when a nobleman was killed in battle far from home, the body would be defleshed by boiling or some such other method, and his bones transported back to his estate for burial. In response, in the year 1300, Pope Boniface VIII promulgated a law which excommunicated ipso facto anyone who disembowelled bodies of the dead or boiled them to separate the flesh from the bones, for the purpose of transportation for burial in their native land. He further decreed that bodies which had been so treated were to be denied Christian burial.Boniface VIII, Extrav. Comm., Lib. III, Tit. vi, c. i. =The wake= The custom of watching by the dead (the wake) is an ancient practice probably derived from the similar Jewish custom of a pious vigil over the remains. Its origins are not entirely known. This was a Christian observance, attended with the chanting of psalms. In the Middle Ages, among the monastic orders, the custom was practiced in a desire to perform religious duties and was seen as beneficial. By appointing relays of monks to succeed one another, orderly provision was made that the corpse would never be left without prayer. Among secular persons, these nocturnal meetings were sometimes an occasion of grave abuses, especially in the matter of eating and drinking. The following is found in the Anglo-Saxon canons of √Ülfric, addressed to the clergy: > Ye shall not rejoice on account of men deceased nor attend on the corpse > unless ye be thereto invited. When ye are thereto invited then forbid ye the > heathen songs (haethenan sangas) of the laymen and their loud cachinnations; > nor eat ye nor drink where the corpse lieth therein, lest ye be imitators of > the heathenism which they there commit. In the earliest Ambrosian ritual (eighth or ninth century), which Magistretti pronounces to be derived from Rome,Magistretti, Manuale Ambrosianum, Milan, 1905, I, 67 sqq. the funeral is broken up into stages: at the house of the deceased, on the way to the church, at the church, from the church to the grave, and at the grave side. But it is also clear that there was originally something of the nature of a wake (vigilioe) consisting in the chanting of the whole Psalter beside the dead man at his home.Magistretti, ib., I, 70 =Absolution= The Absolution became common in the second half of the eleventh century. It involves laying a form of absolution upon the breast of the deceased. This is enjoined in the monastic constitutions of Archbishop Lanfranc. Occasionally, a leaden cross etched with a few words was used for this purpose. Many such crosses have been recovered in opening tombs belonging to this period. =Offertory= The medieval ritual also included an offertory in the funeral of well known and distinguished people. Generous offerings were made in money, and in kind, in the hope of benefiting the soul of the deceased. It was also usual to lead his war-horse up the church fully accoutered and to present it to the priest at the altar rails. It would later be redeemed by a money payment. Western Catholic burial ritual Funeral procession of Anne of Bohemia, Queen consort of England, 1394 The various Roman Catholic Church religious observances surrounding mortal remains can be divided into three stages. The following three stages assume, however, that the full funeral rites are celebrated, including the Funeral (Requiem) Mass, which, since it is a Mass, must be celebrated by a priest. If a Catholic deacon celebrates, the Funeral Mass does not occur, however, a Memorial Mass may be said later for the deceased. The deacon leads the prayer services at the home and the funeral home, blesses the remains at the church during another prayer service, and then leads the prayers of final commendation at the graveside. In an increasing number of cases where there are not enough priests and deacons, lay people will lead prayers in the home of the deceased, the Vigil for the Deceased at the church, and also prayers at the graveside (the only funeral service which requires an ordained priest is the Requiem Mass itself). If the traditional three-part funeral rites are celebrated, they proceed as follows: =Conveyance of the body to the church= John Hughes prepared for burial, St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, New York, 1864. The first stage involves the parish priest and other clergy going to the house of the deceased. One cleric carries the cross and another carries a vessel of holy water. Before the coffin is removed from the house it is sprinkled with the holy water. The priest, with his assistants, says the psalm De profundis with the antiphon Si iniquitates. Then the procession sets out for the church. The cross-bearer goes first, followed by members of the clergy carrying lighted candles. The priest walks immediately before the coffin, and the friends of the deceased and others walk behind it. Note that in the vast majority of cases none of the above will happen. The priest or deacon will go to the house without procession, or lay people will lead the prayers in the presence of the body if clergy are not available. Funeral procession from the \\"Healing Window\\" at Canterbury Cathedral. As they leave the house, the priest intones the antiphon Exsultabunt Domino, and then the psalm Miserere is recited or chanted in alternate verses by the cantors and clergy. On reaching the church the antiphon Exsultabunt is repeated. As the body is placed \\"in the middle of the church,\\" the responsorial Subvenite is recited. Once again, this seldom happens. The coffin is brought to the church by the undertaker in a hearse. It may arrive the evening before, for a Vigil in the church, or it may arrive on the day of the funeral before the service. Historical precedence provides that if the corpse is a layman, the feet are to be turned towards the altar. If the corpse is a priest, then the position is reversed, the head being towards the altar. The earliest reference to this is in Johann Burchard's \\"Diary\\". Burchard was the master of ceremonies to Pope Innocent VIII and Pope Alexander VI. A little-known custom also exists that both before the altar and in the grave, the feet of all Christians should be pointed to the East. This custom is alluded to by Bishop Hildebert at the beginning of the twelfth century,Hildebert of Tours, Sermones (P.L., CLXXI, 896) and its symbolism is discussed by Guillaume Durand. \\"A man ought so to be buried\\", he says, \\"that while his head lies to the West his feet are turned to the East‚Ä¶\\"Guillaume Durand, Rationale divinorum officiorum, VII, 35 For clergy, however, the idea seems to be that the bishop (or priest) in death should occupy the same position in the church as during life, facing his people who he taught and blessed in Christ's name. In practice, facing the east is scarcely ever observed. =Ceremony in the church= A Funeral Service, Les Tr√®s Riches Heures du duc de Berry, Folio 199v. Mus√©e Cond√©, Chantilly. The second stage is a cycle of prayers, the funeral Mass, and absolution. In the Tridentine Rite, candles are lit around the coffin, and they are allowed to burn throughout this stage. In the post-Vatican II rite there are no candles. Prayers The prayers offered are the Office of the Dead. Throughout the prayers, certain omissions are made. For example, each psalm ends with Requiem aeternam instead of the Gloria Patri. Mass for the Dead As in the case of the Office, the Mass for the Dead (Missa de Requiem) is chiefly distinguished from ordinary Masses by certain omissions. Some of these may be due to the fact that this Mass was formerly regarded as supplementary to the Mass of the day. In other cases it preserves the tradition of a more primitive age. The suppression of the Alleluia, Gloria in excelsis, and the Gloria Patri seems to point to a sense of the incongruity of joyful themes in the presence of God's searching and inscrutable judgments.Cf. Antonio Maria Ceriani, Circa obligationem Officii Defunctorum, 9. In the early Christian ages, however, it would seem that the Alleluia, especially in the East, was regarded as especially appropriate to funerals, as Christians rejoiced that the deceased was now closer to God than they were themselves. During the Mass it used to be customary to distribute candles to the congregation. These were lit during the Gospel, during the latter part of the Holy Sacrifice from the Elevation to the Communion, and during the absolution which follows the Mass. As already remarked the association of lights with Christian funerals is very ancient, and liturgists here recognize a symbolical reference to baptism whereby Christians are made the children of Light, as well as a concrete reminder of the oft repeated prayer et lux perpetua luceat eis. Today, giving candles to the congregation is hardly ever done. In the ordinary form of the Roman Rite (the Mass of Paul VI) the order of choice for liturgical colors is white, or violet, or black. It is recommended that the coffin be covered by a white pall. In the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite, the funeral Mass is a Requiem. In a Requiem Mass the priest always wears black vestments, and the pall is black. There are also slightly different ceremonies of the Mass and slightly different texts. When the deceased is a baptised child under the age of reason the priest wears white vestments as a symbol of the innocence of the deceased and the attendant belief that the child will immediately be received into heaven without the need to endure purgatory. The liturgical books for the extraordinary form have never prescribed a particular Mass for the funeral of such children, but the custom is that the votive Mass of the Angels is said. The funeral Mass is sometimes called the \\"Mass of Christian Burial\\", \\"Mass of the Resurrection\\", or \\"Memorial Mass\\", but these terms are not found in the Order of Christian Funerals, which is the official book in the ordinary form of the Church, and should be discouraged. Absolution The absolution of the dead was removed from the ordinary form of the Roman Rite, and replaced with the Final Commendation and Farewell, when the new Order of Christian Funerals was promulgated following the Second Vatican Council. However, the absolution of the dead remains part of the funeral service of the Tridentine Mass. The absolution of the dead is a series of prayers for pardon that are said over the body of a deceased Catholic following a Requiem Mass and before burial. The absolution of the dead does not forgive sins or confer the sacramental absolution of the Sacrament of Penance. Rather, it is a series of prayers to God that the person's soul will not have to suffer the temporal punishment in purgatory due for sins which were forgiven during the person's life. During the absolution, the Libera me, Domine is sung while the priest incenses the coffin and sprinkles it with holy water. The prayer for absolution is said by the priest, and then the In paradisum is sung while the body is carried from the church. =Ceremony by the graveside= Burial at Ornans (1850, Gustave Courbet, Louvre, Paris). After the absolution, the body is carried to the grave. The tomb or burial plot is then blessed, if it has not been blessed previously. A grave newly dug in an already consecrated cemetery is considered blessed, and requires no further consecration. However, a mausoleum erected above ground or even a brick chamber beneath the surface is regarded as needing blessing when used for the first time. This blessing is short and consists only of a single prayer after which the body is again sprinkled with holy water and incensed. Apart from this, the service at the graveside is very brief. In the Tridentine tradition, the priest intones the antiphon \\"I am the Resurrection and the Life\\", after which the coffin is lowered into the grave and the Canticle Benedictus is recited or sung. Then the antiphon is repeated again, the Lord's Prayer is said silently, while the coffin is again sprinkled with holy water. Finally, after one or two brief responses, the following ancient prayer is said: > Grant this mercy, O Lord, we beseech Thee, to Thy servant departed, that he > may not receive in punishment the requital of his deeds who in desire did > keep Thy will, and as the true faith here united him to the company of the > faithful, so may Thy mercy unite him above to the choirs of angels. Through > Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. The final petition made by the priest is \\"May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace.\\" At that point, the graveside ceremony and the burial is complete. In the post-Vatican II rite, the prayers are different. =Burial fees= In principle, there was no fee for Christian burial. According to Canon Law, any faithful could be buried by the priest for free; and this has been confirmed by several Ecumenical council during the Middle Ages, such as the Third (1179) and the Fourth (1215) Council of the Lateran. Charging money to conduct burials, bless a marriage or to celebrate any of the sacraments was considered as a crime of Simony. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the Western Christianity, but especially after the 11th century, a considerable part of the doctrine, as well as the Canon Law itself, accepted a rightful compensation for the work of the minister. This compensation had to be based on local \\"laudable customs\\" or on a voluntary payment,Cf. Alfred Nothum, La r√©mun√©ration du travail inh√©rent aux fonctions spirituelles et la simonie de droit divin, Roma, Libreria Editrice dell'Universit√† Gregoriana, 1969 but many parishes turned these fees into a standard scale of charges. This attitude resulted above all from the desire to strengthen parish incomes, often very small especially in rural areas. Although many critics attacked these exactions, in all Christian countries burial fees were regularly perceived by the clergy. Moreover, in contexts where parishes hosted a vestry (such as in England and France), the parishioners had to pay a certain amount to the wardens for the use of the churchyard or the church itself, when the burial took place inside it. This contribution was often called the right \\"for breaking the ground\\".Thomas W. Laqueur, The Work of the Dead. A cultural history of mortal remains, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2015, p. 153 After the Reformation, in both catholic and reformed areas, burial payments were standardized in tables of fees that had to be displayed at the entrance of the church or inside the sacristy. These tables registered also payments due for marriages, christenings, and, in some countries such as England, for the churching of women. The promulgation of tables of fees continues today in most of the Christian countries where there is an organized church. Protestant burials Protestant burial services and rituals vary enormously between denominations. =Methodist funeral= The United Methodist Church and the Methodist Church of Great Britain have funeral liturgies based on the Sarum Rite that emphasize \\"the paschal character of Christian death and connected the last rite with baptism\\". The Order for the Burial of the Dead in the Methodist Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965) specifies that \\"Funeral Services of church members should be held in the sanctuary. The casket should be placed before the altar\\". The casket or coffin is traditionally covered with a white pall symbolizing the resurrection of Christ. The official name for the liturgy in the United Methodist Church is \\"A Service of Death and Resurrection\\"; it includes the elements found in a standard liturgy celebrated on the Lord's Day, such as the Entrance, Opening Prayer, Old Testament Reading, Psalm, New Testament Reading, Alleluia, Gospel Reading, Sermon, Recitation of one of the ecumenical creeds, prayers of the faithful, offertory, and celebration of the Eucharist, as well as the Commendation. The Commendation contains prayer for the dead, including a variation of the Eternal Rest prayer. Following this, \\"A Service of Committal\\" takes place in the graveyard or cemetery. Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic burial ritual Funeral of Indian Syro-Malabar Eastern Catholic Venerable Varghese Payyappilly Palakkappilly on 6 October 1929. Grave of Alexander Nevsky Lavra, an Orthodox Christian in Lazarev Cemetery. The full burial service of the Eastern Orthodox Church is lengthy, and there are several features unique to the Eastern Church. There are five different funeral services, depending upon the deceased's station in life: laity, children, monks, priests, and a special form served for all of the above during Bright Week (Easter week). =Ablutions= When an Orthodox Christian is preparing for death, the priest comes to hear the final confession and give Holy Communion, if the dying one is conscious (Holy Unction is not a part of Orthodox last rites). The priest then reads the Office at the Parting of the Soul from the Body, which consists of prayers and a canon to encourage repentance, and help ease the soul's transition from earthly life to the hereafter. There is a special form of this service \\"For One who has Suffered Long\\". Immediately after death, a unique memorial service, called the \\"First Pannikhida\\" is celebrated. After this, the body is washed and clothed for burial. Traditionally, this act of love is performed by the family and friends of the deceased (). A crown (sometimes referred to as a phylactery), is placed upon the dead layman's head. This consists of a strip of paper upon which the Trisagion is written, and sometimes an icon of the Deesis is printed on it as well. A small icon of Christ, the Theotokos or the deceased's patron saint is placed in the right hand; or, alternately, a cross. A prayer rope may be placed in his left hand. If the deceased served in the military or held some other high office, he or she may be dressed in his or her uniform. If a man had been tonsured as a Reader, he will be vested in a sticharion. If he had been ordained a Subdeacon he will be vested in his sticharion and orarion. A deceased deacon is vested in sticharion and orarion, and a censer is placed in his right hand. A monk's body is prepared by one of his brethren in the monastery. He will be clothed in his monastic habit and a prayer rope placed in his hands. If he was a Stavrophore or Megaloschema-monk he will be wrapped in his mandyas (cloak), from which two strips will be cut. These strips are wound around the body, so that they cross over the breast, the waist and the legs, thus symbolising not only the cross, but also the swaddling bands in which Jesus was wrapped as a baby, since the death of the body is considered to be a birth for the soul into new life. His klobuk will be placed backwards over his head so that the veil covers his face. Nuns are similarly arrayed. Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens laid in his coffin. His paterissa can be seen to the right, but the A√´r has not yet been laid over his face. The body of a deceased priest or bishop is prepared by the clergy, and is anointed with oil. He is then clothed in his full Eucharistic vestments (however, if he was a hieromonk he will usually be clothed in his monastic habit and be vested only in his epitrachelion [stole] and epimanikia [cuffs]). His face is covered with an A√´r, the liturgical veil with which the Holy Mysteries (chalice and paten) are covered during the Divine Liturgy. Also a Gospel Book is laid upon his breast (a similar practice was found in the West in the early Spanish Ordinal). When a bishop dies, he is vested by the clergy in his full episcopal vestments, including mitre. As each vestment is placed on him, a Protodeacon swings the censer and reads the vesting prayers, exactly as was done for him when he served the Divine Liturgy. After the vesting the bishop is set upright in a chair and the dikirion and trikirion (candlesticks used by a bishop to bless the people) are placed in his hands as the clergy chant Eis polla eti, Despota! for the final time. He is then placed in his coffin. In ancient times, and still in some places, the bishop is not placed in a coffin, but remains seated in a chair, and is even buried in a sitting position. This custom was taken from the burial customs of the Byzantine Emperors. After the clothing of the deceased, the priest sprinkles the coffin with holy water on all four sides, and the deceased is placed in the coffin. Then the wake begins immediately. Often, an Orthodox casket will have a solid lid which is removable. The lid, with a large cross on it, is often placed outside the front door of the house as a sign that the house is in mourning, and to invite all who pass by to pray for the deceased and give comfort to the bereaved. =Wake= For Orthodox Christians the wake consists of continuous reading of the Psalter aloud, interrupted only by the occasional serving of Panikhidas (brief memorial services). Anyone is allowed to read, and the family and friends will often take turns reading the psalms throughout the night up until it is time to take the body to the church. If the deceased was a priest or bishop the reading is done by the higher clergy (bishops, priests and deacons) and instead of reading the Psalter, they read from the Gospel Book. If there are not enough clergy to read continuously, the laity may read the Psalter at times clergy are unavailable. =Conveyance of the Body to the Church= After a final Panikhida at the house of the deceased, the body is brought to the church in a procession headed by the cross and banners. The priest or deacon walks in front of the coffin with the censer. During the procession all sing the Trisagion. Bells may be rung during the procession, though they are not required by the rubrics. Once the procession arrives at the church, the coffin is placed either in the center of the nave or, if the narthex is large enough it is placed there. Four candlestands are placed around the coffin, forming a cross. The priest censes around the coffin and begins a Panikhida. Then, the reading of the Psalter continues until the beginning of the services. =Ceremony in the Church= Schema-Archmandrite Anastasi (Popov). Throughout the service, upon a table close to the coffin stands a dish containing kolyva, made of wheat‚Äîsymbolic of the grain which falling to the ground dies and brings forth much fruit ()‚Äîand honey‚Äîsymbolic of the sweetness of the Heavenly Kingdom. A taper is placed in the kolyva and is lit during the service. In the Orthodox funeral, the coffin is usually open in church (unlike the West, where it is usually closed), and the lower part of the coffin is covered with a funeral pall. The lid of the casket may be left outside the church door, as an invitation to all who pass by to enter and join in the funeral.  Divine Liturgy for the departed  In some Slavic traditions, Divine Liturgy takes place as usual, with the addition of special hymns for the departed. There are also special Epistle and Gospel readings for the dead, which vary according to the day of the week on which the funeral is served. There will also be a special ektenia (litany) for the departed, and at the end another Panikhida will be served around the coffin. Funeral service The funeral will usually begin immediately after the dismissal of the Divine Liturgy. The funeral service is called in Greek, Pannychis, meaning vigil, and it originally lasted through the entire night and into the next morning. Today, it has been considerably shortened, but it may still last around two and a half hours. Throughout the entire service, everyone holds lighted candles, and the censer is swung by the deacon or priest throughout much of the service. Because death is not defeat for a faithful Christian, the Alleluia is sung as part of the service, with special funeral verses. Cross procession during the burial of an Orthodox priest in Sretensky Monastery (Moscow). As mentioned above, there are five different funeral services, all of which have different outlines: *Laymen‚ÄîThis is the most common form of funeral; it is used for all adult members of the laity and for lower clergy and deacons. It is the form detailed below. *Children‚ÄîBecause young children are generally not held to be morally responsible for their sins, the funeral for a child has none of the usual penitential elements, or prayers for the forgiveness of the sins of the deceased. *Monks‚ÄîThe burial of monks and nuns differs in a number of respects, most noticeably that there is no canon, but rather special antiphons are chanted in all the eight tones in succession, as if recalling the monastic's participation in the whole life of the Church. This funeral is used for all tonsured monks, and for hierodeacons. Some hieromonks (priest-monks) are buried using the monastic ritual. *Priests‚ÄîWhen bishops and priests are buried, their funeral is different from those of laymen or monks (a hieromonk may be buried either as a monk or as a priest). Because of their important role as preachers of the Word, the funeral for priests has numerous Gospel readings in it. These are usually read from the Gospel Book which has been placed in the coffin. *Paschal‚ÄîBecause of the joy and extraordinary grace of the Paschal season, any funeral performed during Bright Week (Easter week) is remarkably different from that served at any other time of year. In place of the mournful melodies and penitential nature of the normal funeral services, joyful paschal hymns are chanted. There is also a special paschal funeral for children. Important features of the funeral service are as follows: ;Psalm 118 Right at the beginning of the funeral, Psalm 118 (Septuagint numbering; KJV: Psalm 119) is chanted. In the Orthodox Psalter this is known as the 17th Kathisma, and is the longest psalm in the Bible. The psalm is divided into three sections, called Stases, the first two of which is followed by a brief Ektenia (litany) for the Dead. Each verse of the Psalm is followed by a refrain. The refrain at the first and third stases is \\"Alleluia\\", the refrain for the second stasis is \\"Have mercy upon Thy servant.\\" The Kathisma is followed by a set of hymns called the Evlogitaria, which is based upon a similar Paschal hymn chanted during the Easter season and on Sunday. Thus the themes of prayer for God's mercy and of the General Resurrection are tied together. ;Kontakion The Kontakion of the Dead is one of the most moving portions of the service. It is linked to the Ikhos, another hymn which follows it. During the funeral it takes place after the Sixth Ode of the Canon. It is also chanted during panikhidas (memorial services) which are conducted both before and after the funeral: > Kontakion: With the saints give rest, O Christ, to the soul of Thy servant > where there is neither sickness, nor sorrow, nor sighing, but life > everlasting. > Ikhos: Thou alone art immortal, who hast created and fashioned man. But we > are mortal formed of the earth, and unto earth shall we return, as Thou who > madest me didst command and say unto us: Thou art dust, and to dust shalt > thou return. Whither, also, all we mortals wend our way, making as a funeral > dirge the song: Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! The Russian melody for this Kontakion was famously sung during the funeral scene in the movie, Doctor Zhivago. ;Hymns of St. John Damascene After the canon, the choir chants stichera that were composed by St. John Damascene. According to tradition, Saint John composed these hymns to help one of the brethren in his monastery as he grieved for a family member. There are eight stichera, each composed in one of the tones of the Octoechos. These hymns are also chanted on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings throughout the year, since Saturday is a day set aside for general commemoration of the departed. ;Absolution At the end of the funeral service, the spiritual father of the deceased will read the Prayer of Absolution, which is printed on a separate piece of paper. After the prayer, he will roll the paper up and place it in the deceased's hand. ;Last kiss Symbolic farewell is taken of the deceased by a \\"last kiss\\", during which the faithful come forward and give a last kiss of peace to the departed. Though traditions vary, often they will kiss the phylactory on the deceased's forehead and the icon or cross in his hand. During this time, the choir chants moving hymns which are intended to assist the mourners as they work through their grief and love for the deceased. ;Memory Eternal After the last kiss, the choir chants, \\"Memory Eternal\\" (Slavonic: Vyechnaya pamyat) three times, to a slow and solemn melody. If the deceased has a shroud, it is pulled over the face of the deceased. Finally, the coffin is closed. In some traditions, the priest will sprinkle a little earth on the remains, in the shape of a cross, before closing the coffin. =Ceremony at the graveside= An Orthodox priest being carried to the cemetery on the shoulders of his brother priests. A procession forms, with the cross and banners going from the church to the cemetery. This procession is similar to the one during which the body was taken to the church. If the deceased is a priest, instead of singing the Trisagion, the clergy chant the Irmoi of the \\"Great Canon\\" written by St. Andrew of Crete. ;Tolling of bells During the procession, the bells are tolled. In the Russian tradition, the funeral toll is called Perebor. Each individual bell is struck once, from the smallest to the largest, in a slow, steady peal. After that, all of the bells are struck together at the same time. Striking the bells from the smallest to the largest symbolizes the stages of a person‚Äôs life from birth to death; the final striking of all the bells together symbolizes the end of this earthly life. ;Committal Upon arriving at the grave, the Panikhida is again chanted. The coffin may be sealed with nails. Traditionally there are four nails, reminiscent of the nails with which Christ was affixed to the Cross. As the body is lowered into the grave, the choir chants: > Open wide, O earth, and receive him (her) that was fashioned from thee by > the hand of God aforetime, and who returneth again unto Thee that gave him > (her) birth. That which was made according to his image the Creator hath > received unto himself; do thou receive back that which is thine own. Then the priest takes a shovelful of dirt and makes the Sign of the Cross with it in the grave, saying: > The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. Syrian bishop seated in state at his funeral (ca. 1945). If the deceased received the Sacred Mystery (Sacrament) of Unction, the priest will pour some of the consecrated oil on the coffin (in some places, this is done at the funeral, immediately before the coffin is closed). The priest then pours the ashes from the censer into the open grave, after which the family and friends fill in the grave as the choir chants hymns. Orthodox Christians are buried facing east; that is to say, with their feet to the east. When a cross is placed at the grave, it is not normally placed at the head of the grave, but at the foot, so that as the faithful stand at the grave and pray facing the cross, they will be facing east, in the traditional Orthodox manner. In the Byzantine era, bishops were buried sitting upright in a chair, a practice that is still observed in some places. After the remains were lowered into the ground, the bishop's mitre would be removed, and his monastic klobuk placed on his head so that the veil covered his face. In the Orthodox Church, it is only permitted to celebrate a funeral for a person who is a member of the Orthodox Church in good standing. Generally speaking, funerals are not permitted for persons who have committed suicide, or who will be voluntarily cremated. In cases where the local authorities impose cremation, such as for reasons of public health, this is no obstacle to an Orthodox funeral. For those persons for whom a funeral is not allowed, the most that may be done is the chanting of the Trisagion as the body is being carried to the cemetery. The Orthodox burial rite is discussed in several sources.Al. Dmitrieoski (1895-1901), Kiev =Mourning period= Orthodox Christians do not consider death to be an end, but a beginning. However, sorrow at the separation from a loved one is natural to the human condition. In Orthodox theology, Jesus' weeping for his friend Lazarus is understood as a manifestation of the fullness of his humanity (). But Christians are taught not to grieve \\"even as others which have no hope\\" (). In the light of the Resurrection, the death of a believer is not considered to be a tragedy but a triumph. Both the funeral and the memorial services feature the singing of \\"Alleluia\\" many times. The first traditional mourning period of Orthodox Christians lasts for forty days. During this period, certain days are considered to have special significance: the third day (on which the funeral is usually held), the ninth day, and the fortieth day. Of these three days, the fortieth is the most important, because it is believed that on that day the soul undergoes the Particular Judgment, which will determine the state of the soul until its reunification with the glorified body at the Second Coming. For close relatives, the mourning period usually lasts for a year. During this period Panikhidas (memorial services) are served to pray for the repose of the soul of the deceased and to comfort their loved ones. Normally, after forty days, memorials are taking place at three months, six months, nine months (terms corresponding to the Holy Trinity), at a year and in each subsequent year on the anniversary of death, for seven years in a row. It is a common practice for the friends and family to request a memorial at least on the deceased's anniversary of death. The first anniversary is almost universally celebrated, and many families will continue to request annual memorials on every anniversary of death. =Offerings= It is customary for almsgiving to be done in the name of a departed person. This not only honors their memory, but is believed to also be of spiritual benefit to them. The departed are also commemorated regularly during the Proskomedie of the Divine Liturgy. The name of the departed is given to the priest, who then removes a particle of bread from the prosphoron (loaf of bread) offered for the Liturgy. In the Russian usage, there is a separate prosphoron for the departed, from which these memorial particles are taken. After the consecration, these particles are placed in the chalice, and the church teaches that the departed benefit spiritually from this action more than any other on their behalf.Pope St. Gregory the Great, Dialogues IV: 57, 60 =Consecration of a Cemetery= In the Orthodox Church there is a ritual for the \\"Consecration of a Cemetery\\", found in the Euchologion (Slavonic: Trebnik). A large cross is erected in the center of the cemetery. The ritual begins with the Lesser Blessing of Waters. Then the cross and the entire property are consecrated with prayers, incense and the sprinkling of holy water. Persons for whom a funeral service may not be chanted (see paragraphs above) may not be buried in a consecrated cemetery without the blessing of the local bishop. If it is not possible to bury an Orthodox Christian in a consecrated cemetery, the individual grave may be consecrated, using the rite called the \\"Blessing of a Grave\\". Burial confraternities Even from the period of the catacombs such associations seem to have existed among the Christians and they no doubt imitated to some extent in their organization the pagan collegia for the same purpose. Throughout the Middle Ages the guilds to a very large extent were burial confraternities; at any rate the seemly carrying out of the funeral rites at the death of any of their members together with a provision of Masses for his soul form an almost invariable feature in the constitutions of such guilds. But still more directly to the purpose we find certain organizations formed to carry out the burial of the dead and friendless as a work of charity. The most celebrated of these was the \\"Misericordia\\" of Florence, believed to have been instituted in 1244 by Pier Bossi, and surviving to the present day. It is an organization which associates in this work of mercy the members of all ranks of society. Their self-imposed task is not limited to escorting the dead to their last resting- place, but they discharge the functions of an ambulance corps, dealing with accidents as they occur and carrying the sick to the hospitals. When on duty until recently the members wore a hood which completely disguised them.

It is home to about 90 people, and has long been known for its population being composed of strong women and docile men. It's becoming a popular tourist destination, thanks to the many unusual rock formations, and is connected to the mainland by two regular ferries and numerous excursion boats. Mara-do is within the administrative boundaries of Daejeong Township (Daejeong-eup) in Seogwipo City, and is included, along with Gapa Island (Gapado), in Gapa-ri, and is South Korea's southernmost point. Because of its subtropical marine habitat the island is a natural reserve. It was designated as National Monument no. 423 (Ï≤úÏó∞Í∏∞ÎÖêÎ¨º Ï†ú423Ìò∏) on July 18, 2000. Overview Marado was originally uninhabited. It was known as Keumdo (Í∏àÎèÑ,Á¶ÅÂ≥∂), which means forbidden island. According to a Choson Ilbo article published by Lee Kyu-tae in 1967, the island was first occupied by a woman named Kim Seong-oh (ÍπÄÏÑ±Ïò§,ÈáëÊàê‰∫î) and her brothers in 1880. As a poor peasant with no land to farm, Kim Seong-oh decided to move to the island when her father mentioned the island on his deathbed. So Kim left Jeju with her two brothers, farming tools, and some seeds. They had to circle the island around three times, because they couldn't find a place to dock their boat. After about 10 years, they were joined by two stranded fishermen from Torishima (ÎèÑÎ¶¨ÏÑ¨,È≥•Â≥∂), in the Kingdom of Ryukyu.http://kr.blog.yahoo.com/waterview33/969 However, documents from Jeju county also had another story on Marado. According to this story, the first residents came to live on Marado in 1883. One Mr. Kim originally living in Daejeong gol, a small village in Jeju, ran through all his fortune. His relatives proposed to let them move to Marado. Sim Hyun Taek, pastor of Jeju at that time, permitted them to do so, and Marado became inhabited for the first time. After independence, it was administered by Gapa-ri, Daejeong-eup of Jeju, and registered as an independent township(ri) called Marari. Coastline Marado is an island with an exceptionally rocky coastline; sea caves are found on the island as well.

It is a diagnostic tool that helps researchers/teachers gain insight into the reading process. The term \\"miscue\\" was initiated by Ken Goodman to describe an observed response in the reading process that does not match the expected response. Goodman uses the term \\"miscue,\\" rather than \\"error\\" or \\"mistake\\" to avoid value implications. He states that the departures from the text are not necessarily a negative aspect of the reading process but rather \\"windows on the reading process\\" (Goodman, 1969, p. 123). Studies Miscue analysis procedures include the collection and examination of a single and complete oral reading experience followed by a retelling. The procedures and standards are outlined in both the Goodman Taxonomy and the Reading Miscue Inventory (Goodman, Watson, & Burke, 2005). Miscue analysis differs significantly from other laboratory-centered or experimental diagnostic and evaluative instruments in that miscue research studies reading in as natural a condition as possible, with readers orally reading authentic and complete stories they have not been exposed to before. In this way, miscue analysis provides a naturalistic viewpoint and the resulting analysis of reading proficiency is both qualitative and quantitative. To date, hundreds of studies on miscue analysis have been conducted from different perspectives to explore the reading process, to evaluate readers, and to improve reading instruction (Brown, Goodman, & Marek, 1996). Although their foci are different, these studies have generally confirmed Goodman's model and theory of reading view that reading is a meaning-seeking process in which readers use graphic, phonemic, syntactic, and semantic cues to make sense of texts. Philosophy A key assumption of miscue analysis is that what readers do is neither accidental nor random. Rather, it is cued by language and personal experience (Goodman, 1973, p. 93). The insights gained from miscue analysis have contributed to the development of the Goodman Reading Model‚Äîa transactional, socio-psycholinguistic theory and model of reading. Such analysis has made an ideological shift away from a deficit-oriented view of readers' weaknesses toward a view that appreciates the linguistic strengths that readers bring to the reading process as they construct meaning from a text. In addition, miscue analysis helps researchers/teachers evaluate reading materials, and thus provides them with an objective basis for selecting suitable texts for readers. The most basic contribution of miscue analysis to knowledge of the reading process is its demonstration that reading is an active, receptive language process. Miscue analysis also helps researchers/teachers analyze the oral reading of individual readers. Opposing viewpoint Goodman's approach has been criticized by other researchers who favor a phonics-based approach, and present research to support their viewpoint. From this perspective, good readers use decoding as their primary approach to reading, and use context to confirm that what they have read makes sense. Good readers decode rapidly and automatically. Poor readers, who have not developed this fluency skill, use such strategies as drawing from context in combination with looking at the picture or using only some of the letters in the words to predict a word that would make sense in context. Studies have shown that even good readers can correctly guess words in context only one out of ten times. When students look at pictures as a reference, a strategy that is encouraged by whole language proponents, they will sometimes stop at the unknown word, look at the picture or consider the overall meaning of the sentence, then say a word that makes sense in context, rather than use graphophonemic clues. With such an approach, a child may read \\"I see a bunny,\\" when in fact the last word in the sentence might read as \\"rabbit.\\" Using miscue analysis, this would be recorded as a miscue that nevertheless preserves the meaning of the sentence, and the child would be encouraged to continue reading, even if such a word does not match the letters in the book. A teacher critical of this approach would note that the child did not use letter-sound correspondence to decode the word, and instead used the picture or context as a way to hypothesize what word makes sense in the text. Such a teacher would work with this child to make sure that he is paying attention to the letter-sound correspondence.SEDL Balanced Reading Critics of the phonics-based perspective point out that fluent readers are those who read both effectively and efficiently. They argue that to conceptualize fluent reading as involving a word-for-word match promotes an inefficient or slow and labored approach to reading. Fluent readers do not look at individual words but rather look at chunks of words and hypothesize approximately what the sentence says, slowing down to look at the word level only when, through self-monitoring, they realize their approximations or hypotheses about what the sentence says does not make sense. In fact, fluent adult readers miscue (or read something other than what the text says) 20‚Äì40% of the time. Reading in this way, as all fluent readers do, allows for efficient reading. Effective reading involves the ability to self-monitor and apply strategies such as phonics, looking at pictures, skipping words, or using synonym substitutions when coming to words that the reader does not know. In contrast to the argument that reduces the complexity of good reading to rapid and automatic decoding, this perspective acknowledges that all good readers come to words they do not know and constantly miscue, and that good reading is the ability to effectively solve problems that arise in reading through a range of strategies. As Pinnell and Fountas (1998) point out, English is a language made up of several distinct languages and therefore is not phonetically regular. Only about half of the words readers encounter can be efficiently decoded using phonetic knowledge. Therefore, a range of strategies are needed for effective reading. Shared perspective Regardless of one's position on the centrality of phonics in reading, self-monitoring for meaning-making is critically important. From both a transactional perspective and a perspective that puts more emphasis on phonics in word solving, many poor readers will use the first letter or letters to guess at the identity of the word, and then continue reading even though the sentence with the inserted or miscued word does not make sense. A good reader will realize that the sentence does not make sense and will reread the sentence and the word and self-correct in order to be an effective reader. Notes References * Brown, J.

He went to Edinburgh College of Art between 1918 and 1921, and there he made friends with other young artists like William Gillies, William Geissler, Anne Redpath, John Maxwell, William Crozier and Adam Bruce Thomson. Later they would be considered the core group of the Edinburgh School. Crozier was a major artistic influence on MacTaggart, and he joined his friend on some of his trips to the south of France, made for the sake of MacTaggart's health, as well as for painting opportunities. In 1927 he joined the Society of Eight whose members included Cadell and Peploe, and two years later held his first solo exhibition. In the early 1930s he shared a studio with Gillies. MacTaggart started teaching at Edinburgh College of Art in 1933 and was president of the Society of Scottish Artists between 1933 and 1936. In 1948 the Royal Scottish Academy made him an Academician and he later served as their President from 1959 to 1969. He was also a member of the Royal Academy in London and was knighted in 1962. In 1967 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Harold R. Fletcher, Stanley Cursiter, Norman Feather and Neil Campbell. He died on 9 January 1981.

It contains two antiretroviral medications, lamivudine and zidovudine. It is used together with other antiretrovirals. It is taken by mouth twice a day. Common side effects include headache, feeling tired, nausea, diarrhea, and fever. Severe side effects may include bone marrow suppression, muscle damage, worsening of hepatitis B if previously infected, high blood lactate and liver enlargement. It may be part of a recommended treatment during pregnancy. The medications are both of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class. They work by blocking the action of the enzyme, reverse transcriptase, that the virus requires to reproduce. Lamivudine/zidovudine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997 and in the European Union in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.  Medical uses  It is indicated for use in combination with an additional antiretroviral agent for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. = Pregnancy = Lamividine/zidovudine is categorized pregnancy category C in the United States, meaning there are potential risks to the baby during pregnancy, but potential benefits may outweigh the risks. Data supports the safety of this combination during pregnancy and is often preferred over other fixed dose combinations during pregnancy.  Side effects  The most common adverse effects of Lamividine/zidovudine are similar to other NRTI's and includes headache, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, myopathy and nail pigmentation. More serious and potentially life-threatening adverse effects reported include lactic acidosis with hepatic steatosis, but this rare adverse event is mostly associated with Zidovudine. HIV-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are at risk for potential flares of hepatitis that can occur with abrupt discontinuation of Lamividine/zidovudine because Lamivudine is also used in low doses for treatment against active HBV.  Interactions  = Drug-drug interactions = Lamividine/zidovudine interacts with stavudine and zalcitabine by competing intracellularly for activation and results in inhibiting phosphorylation. There is also a known interaction with nephrotoxic or bone marrow suppressive agents (e.g. doxorubicin) which increases the risk of hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. Monitoring renal function and hematologic tests can be used to assess these potential interactions. = Drug-food interactions = Half lives of lamivudine and Zidovudine are not affected by food and absorption rates were slowed when taken with food but were not clinically significant, therefore, lamivudine/zidovudine may be taken with or without food.  Mechanism of action  The combination of lamivudine and zidovudine is composed of two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Lamivudine and zidovudine both competitively inhibit and reduce the activity of reverse transcriptase (RT) causing HIV infected cells to decrease the number of viruses in the body. Lamivudine and zidovudine act as nucleoside analogs, which are substrates for the human nucleoside kinases. The initial phosphorylation step is crucial for the drug's activity, then converted into the active 5‚Äô-triphosphate form by host kinases. The drug is then incorporated to the end of the growing chain of the viral DNA causing the chain to be terminated, where nucleotides can no longer be added to the growing viral DNA. Lamividuine and zidovudine combination therapy is believed to work synergistically together to prevent mutations in the HIV virus, which can contribute to drug resistance.  Pharmacokinetics  Lamivudine is well absorbed in the body and distributes widely into the extravascular space. Oral bioavailability is >80% and overall metabolism is insignificant where approximately 95% of the drug is found unchanged in the urine. The only known metabolite found in humans is trans- sulfoxide. The half-life of lamivudine is 10 to 15 hours and binds poorly to plasma proteins. Zidovudine is also well absorbed in the body and penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid. Oral bioavailability is 75% and primarily metabolized by the liver by glucuronidation. The primary metabolite is GZDV, an inactive metabolite produced after first pass metabolism. The half-life of zidovudine is 0.5 to 3 hours and binds poorly to plasma proteins. Lamivudine and zidovudine are not extensively metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes.  History  Lamivudine/zidovudine (brand name Combivir) was introduced to the market with FDA approval in 1997. Its impact in history is significant as it was the first combination therapy with a fixed dose for HIV-positive people, and soon solidified its title as a gold standard as it was the most prescribed NRTI in initial HIV treatment for newly diagnosed patients. The arrival of Combivir was seen as a new revolution in HIV therapy, with its improved toxicity profile and tolerability, especially compared to the undesirable side effects of lone AZT therapy or the unfavorable facial and lipoatrophy seen in Stavudine monotherapy at that time.  Society and culture  Lamivudine/zidovudine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. = Drug formulations = Drug formulations: tablets by mouth # Combivir: lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg (scored). It is marketed by ViiV Healthcare. # Generic: lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg.

He never completed high school, and instead worked in an electronics store on Allenby Street until beginning his mandatory service in the Israel Defense Forces. Rosenstein served in Camp Rabin, but left the army before completing his full term of service. Rosenstein began his criminal career in his youth, starting with small break-ins. With the exception of a robbery conviction in the 1970s, police had never managed to gather sufficient evidence to indict Rosenstein. On 11 December 2003, a bomb aimed at Rosenstein killed three people and injured 18 others in Tel Aviv. The bombing led to a media outcry against the Israeli mob families, with newspapers comparing them with the Palestinians in terms of threat to the Israeli state. Ariel Sharon called an emergency cabinet meeting and the government announced an extra 500 million shekels ($100 million US) in the fight against organised crime. The bombing was the seventh attempt on the life of Rosenstein, who became known as the \\"wolf with seven lives\\" (Zeev meaning wolf in Hebrew), and was said to have been carried out by the Abergil Crime Family, which Rosenstein had been feuding with for several years.

Life and work Born in Tigre, a northern suburb of Buenos Aires, his family moved to the city proper in 1936, and there Carpani finished his secondary school studies. He then started to study law, but soon abandoned it, and at the age of 20 he travelled to Paris, France, where he became first a model for artists and then an artist himself. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1952 and studied a year with master Emilio Pettorutti. His first art exhibition took place in 1957. Together with other artists, he founded the Espartaco movement. Carpani was sympathetic with social causes, and his paintings are focused on topics like the unemployed, the working people and the poor, as well as nationalistic themes. They are strong, solid and clear- cut, often portraiting determined men; this line of work is reflected in his illustrations of Argentina's national epic gauchesque poem, Mart√≠n Fierro. In the 1970s Carpani, like many other Argentine artists, writers and intellectuals during the Proceso de Reorganizaci√≥n Nacional, exiled himself and settled in Madrid, Spain, and then toured Europe, the United States, Cuba, Mexico and Ecuador. Along with others in the Argentine Commission in Defense of Human Rights, he denounced the crimes of the dictatorship for the outside world to know. A year after the restoration of democracy in Argentina, in 1984, Carpani returned to his home country, and he produced a series of portraits (such as those of Julio Cort√°zar and Roberto Arlt). He also started a series of works focused on classic Buenos Aires urban topics (such as tango, caf√©s and the barrios), with tropical backgrounds. Not long before his death, Carpani drew a large portrait of Che Guevara which is now shown at the Plaza de la Cooperaci√≥n in Rosario, a few blocks away from Guevara's birthplace.

The French blood which ran in his veins contributes to his clearness of mind, his habit of clear perception, his ease of exposition, and his uprightness of character. From the combination of the two he derives his constant gaiety and his generosity of heart with all the strength, devotion, and fine feeling which this noble quality implies.\\"Philipon, p. 26, quoting Thibaut. He was baptised with the name \\"Joseph Aloysius\\". From a very early age he was seemingly \\"consumed with some kind of inner fire or enthusiasm for the things of God.\\"Tierney, Josephinum, p. 143. He was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College in Dublin. He entered the seminary at the age of 16.Thibaut, p. 15. At the time he entered the seminary, his \\"faithCatholic \\"faith\\" is an \\"act of the intellect assenting to a Divine truth owing to the movement of the will, which is itself moved by the grace of God.\\" St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, II-II, Q. 4, A. 2. See generally \\"Faith\\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia. See also Faith in Christianity. was very strong\\"; he perceived \\"something more than simple theoretical theses\\" in Catholic doctrine, in particular \\"that a man's love for God is measured by his love for his neighbor.\\" :One day during a vacation [at about the age of 17] he learnt that a poor old woman, well known to his family, was threatened with being summoned before the magistrates by an exacting creditor who claimed the payment of a somewhat large debt. The young seminarian possessed an equivalent amount saved up little by little for a trip he had promised himself. A struggle went on in his heart between his generosity and the legitimate desire to enjoy the fruit of his economies. This struggled lasted all night. In the morning charity had gained the day; with his father's consent he generously made over his savings in favor of the poor woman. A \\"very important moment in Dom Marmion's inner life\\"Thibaut, p. 20. occurred while he was still in seminary. :It seems that one day when returning to the study hall he had all at once, to use his own words, \\"a light on God's Infinity.\\" While this \\"light\\" only lasted for an instant, it was so clear and strong that it left an indelible impression on him, so that... \\"he referred to this not without emotion and thanksgiving during the last days of his life.\\"Earl of Wicklow, p. 14 (quoting Thibaut, p. 20). 1881 He completed his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Irish College and was ordained in 1881.See Thibaut, p. 21. On his journey back to Ireland, he passed through Maredsous, Belgium - a young and dynamic monastery founded 9 years before (in 1872) by Benedictine monks from the Abbey of Beuron, Germany.Thibaut, p. 29, note 2. He wished very much to join the community there.\\"At the moment of crossing the threshold of the cloister he heard, as it were, an inward voice say to him: It is here that I want you.\\" Thibaut, p. 30. But his archbishop in Ireland refused his request to do so and appointed him as curate at Dundrum,The bishop \\"was not opposed to Marmion entering religion, but thought it would be more prudent for Marmion to spend a year or so as a secular priest in Dublin before making any final decision.\\" Tierney, Biography, p. 22. a parish in the south of Dublin. After a year, he was appointed Professor of Metaphysics at Holy Cross College at Clonliffe, the diocesan seminary for Dublin where Marmion himself had studied.Tierney, Biography, p. 27. For the next four years (1882‚Äì1886) he embarked on the education and spiritual direction of others, including his appointment as chaplain to a nearby convent.Thibaut, pp. 31 ff. \\"[W]e can say without injury to his memory that he had little aptitude for business... The story is often told - he used to tell it himself with great merriment - about his unfortunate speculation when chaplain to a certain religious community in Ireland. He wanted to oblige them by buying a horse and trap, and thought he had made a splendid bargain; but the horse proved to be a decrepit old hack, and the trap fell to pieces in no time.\\" Lebbe, Dom Bede, \\"Reminiscences of Abbot Marmion\\" in Abbot Marmion: An Irish Tribute, edited by the Monks of Glenstal (Westminster: The Newman Press, 1948), p. 4. =Parish priest= Marmion's work as a parish priest \\"daily brought him into contact with a cross-section of humanity,\\" and he was \\"called upon to advise, teach, console and give every kind of spiritual and material aid.\\" He \\"possessed an extraordinary facility for adapting himself to other people,\\" and above all \\"in comforting others and putting them at their ease.\\" During this period he began to learn \\"the delicate art of spiritual direction in which he was later to excel.\\"Thibaut, p. 34. His four years as professor at Clonliffe (1882‚Äì1886) \\"helped to complete his intellectual and spiritual formation. Thrown into the atmosphere of college life, he soon found himself in his native element.\\"Tierney, Biography, p. 27. Maredsous (1886-1899) Maredsous Abbey Marmion joined the monastic community at Maredsous in 1886, having received his archbishop's approval.See Tierney, Biography, pp. 29-30. At first, it was very hard for him, even \\"traumatic.\\"Tierney, Biography, p. 31. He was 27 years old, a respected priest and professor. In Maredsous he was a novice, and had as well to learn a language (French) and monastic disciplines that were foreign to him. After his Solemn Profession on February 10, 1891, ColumbaHe took the name Columba after the famous Irish saint. See McDonagh, Thomas, \\"Abbot Marmion and Glenstal,\\" in Abbot Marmion: An Irish Tribute, edited by the Monks of Glenstal (Westminster: The Newman Press, 1948), p. 134. (as he was now called) was appointed to act as assistant to the Novice Master - with whom he got on rather badly\\"One day... the Father Master asked me what caused me most difficulty and made me suffer most. Thinking it the most perfect to be perfectly sincere, I answered, 'You, Reverend Father.'\\" Thibaut, p. 49. - and in addition to preach at parishes in the vicinity of the Abbey. \\"There was an element of the dramatic in his initiation into pastoral work. A neighboring parish priest, whose preacher had unexpectedly failed him on the eve of a great feast, came to the Benedictines to ask their help in his difficulty. The superior was very sorry, but he had no one to offer him except a young Irish monk whose French was far from perfect. 'I will take him all the same,' said the parish priest, and he brought off Dom Columba. Three days later he brought him back to the Abbey saying: 'We have never had such a preacher before in my parish.' And soon the other parish priests were competing with each other for 'the Irish father.'\\"Philipon, p. 44. =Monastic formation= The young monk (1888) During a season of \\"monastic calm\\" from 1891 to 1899, Marmion's spiritual life came \\"to full maturity\\"Thibaut, p. 68. as he attended to \\"the various duties of the monastic state, the life of silence and recollection, of constant fidelity to the liturgy.\\" Of particular importance to him were developing a spirit of obedience,In a letter written circa 1888, Marmion observed: \\"I got light to understand that obedience is everything for a Benedictine.\\" Thibaut, p. 72. That same year he noted: \\"All the evils which have afflicted humanity, destroyed God's work, and filled hell, come from one act of disobedience. All the graces obtained for us by Jesus Christ are due to His obedience.\\" Thibaut, p. 73. Commenting on this, Thibaut adds: \\"This is the thought of St. Paul: 'For all by the disobedience of one man (Adam) were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one (Jesus Christ) many shall be made just.' Romans 5:19.\\" compunction,\\"To-day I had some very useful lights touching compunction.... The angels standing before the throne of God veil their faces and, filled with wonder and admiration at the sight of God's infinite holiness, cry aloud without ceasing 'Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord.' For us sinners here below, our faith should produce the same effect, but differently. Gazing in spirit on this infinite sanctity, we should cry from the bottom of our hearts, 'Mercy, mercy, mercy!' This is our Sanctus, and the Church adopts this in her daily cry, Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie eleison... As their cry is eternal, so should my cry for mercy never cease in this life.\\" Thibaut, p. 70. and humility,\\"I received lately a light on this subject [humility] which I find very useful, viz. God is at this moment gazing at me. He sees down into the depths of my misery. He knows all things, even futura conditionata [i.e., possible future events]. He knows perfectly into what crimes I would fall were He to deprive me of His grace. This is true at every moment, even when I feel burning with the desire of pleasing God. I am so changeable! I find that this thought humbles me, and makes me see how good God is to bear with me, and this it is solely in the merits of Jesus Christ that I must hope.\\" Thibaut, pp. 74-75. as well as continued growth in the fundamental matters of faith,\\"I had been ill for several months; besides some physical suffering, e.g. sleeplessness, etc., I was greatly troubled in mind, and seemed at times quite abandoned by God. On the feast of St. Scholastica, anniversary of my profession, the clouds passed away, and I understood that my trials and temptations had done much good to my soul, and especially I learned what it is to serve God through pure faith, and that those who have not passed through such trials cannot know what it is to believe and hope in God through faith alone. During meditation the words: It is the spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing [John 6:64], made me see clearly that the acts which proceed from a motive of faith are alone supernaturally pleasing to God, and that sensible devotion (caro), although it may aid us to produce these acts more easily, is of itself useless.\\" Thibaut, p. 97. hope,\\"Of hope. I give up all things in this world, and protest solemnly that Dominus pars haereditatis meae [\\"O Lord, the portion of my inheritance\\"; prayer said before putting on priestly vestments]. ...I expect blindly all things from God.\\" Thibaut, p. 80. and charity.\\"Resolution. To venerate habitually Jesus Christ in the person of my brethren... often thinking that what I think of or do to them is done to Jesus Christ.\\" Thibaut, p. 78. Above all, his spiritual life became more and more centered on Christ. :1887: After breakfast, while walking in the garden, I read the eighth chapter of The Imitation of Christ and I felt strongly impelled to take Jesus as my one friend. I realized that, in spite of my great weakness and unfaithfulness, Jesus desired to be my friend above all others. The text: \\"My delights are to be with the children of men\\" [Proverbs 8:31], gripped me and compelled me irresistibly to respond with all my heart to this desire of Jesus. In the course of this meditation I felt the near presence of Jesus and a great desire to do all things before His eyes.Philipon, p. 36 (quoting from Marmion's private notes). :1895: We are infinitely rich in Jesus Christ and God's mercies are to our miseries what the ocean is to a drop of water. We never glorify God more than when despite the sight of our sins and unworthiness we are so filled with confidence in His mercy and in the infinite merits of Jesus Christ that we throw ourselves on His bosom full of confidence and love, sure that He cannot repel us: \\"a humble and contrite heart, Oh God, Thou wilt not despise.\\"Thibaut, p. 103. :1896: Oh, my dear child, I would wish to engrave on your heart in letters of gold this truth, that no matter how great our misery, we are infinitely rich in Jesus Christ, if we unite with Him, if we lean on Him, if we realize constantly by a firm living faith that all the value of our prayer, and of all that we do comes from His merits in us.Thibaut, p. 105. Prior of Mont C√©sar, Louvain (1899-1909) In 1899, Dom Columba helped to found the Abbey of Mont C√©sar, Louvain, Belgium, and became its first Prior.Thibaut, pp. 114 ff. He was invested with heavy responsibilities: Director of Studies for the young monks; Professor of Theology; spiritual director of Carmelite nuns, all in addition to being Prior. He gave retreats in Belgium and the United Kingdom. He also became confessor to the future Cardinal Mercier.Thibaut, pp. 274 ff. =Marmion the teacher= Marmion's great gift for teaching came into full bloom during this period. His lectures were distinguished by, \\"on the one hand, his extreme clearness, and on the other his happy and fluent application of doctrine to the inner life.\\"Thibaut, p. 125. Rather than presenting \\"revealed truths like mere theorems of geometry having no bearing on the interior life,\\"Thibaut, p. 127. Marmion sought to inspire his students to \\"live in and by the mysteries he set forth to them.\\"Thibaut, p. 126. :The fruitful years in Mont C√©sar enabled him to attain an unrivalled mastery of his subjects. Others may surpass him in the detailed documentation of their learning; but when Dom Columba discusses one of the major theses in which dogma approaches the highest mysteries of God... his teaching has a breadth which approaches the infinite. The vast repercussions of his thought, the fruit of long contemplation, throw light on a whole world of secondary conclusions. His trenchant summaries unite with an unusual power of synthesis in one beam of light the diverse aspects of a problem hidden at the first approach in its complexity. The central point stands out in brilliant relief and the whole assembly of connected truths is illuminated by the light of a governing principle which is the key to the whole problem. As a master of synthesis he is unrivalled.Philipon, p. 49. Abbot of Maredsous (1909-1923) Abbot of Maredsous In 1893, Dom Hildebrand de Hemptinne, Second Abbot of Maredsous, was appointed by Pope Leo XIII as the first Abbot Primate of the Benedictine Order.Tierney, Biography, p. 53. At the request of the Pope, Dom Hildebrand continued as Abbot of Maredsous, but relinquished that office in 1909.Tierney, Biography, pp. 54 ff. In that year, at the age of 51, \\"at the height of his powers, both physical and intellectual,\\"Tierney, Biography, p. 131. Dom Marmion was elected Third Abbot of Maredsous. A community consisting of a hundred monks,Tierney, Biography, pp. 56, 131. it ran two schoolsTierney, Biography, p. 64. and was a publisher, in particular of La Revue b√©n√©dictine.Tierney, Biography, p. 138. Marmion adopted as his motto Magis prodesse quam praesse, \\"To serve rather than be served,\\" a maxim taken from the Rule of St. Benedict.Thibaut, p. 173. The monastery had great spiritual and intellectual influence under his leadership. Vocations abounded. But Dom Marmion was not indifferent to temporal matters. Thus he had the Abbey equipped with electricity and central heating, facilities rarely to be found in monasteries at that time.Tierney, Biography, p. 134. :\\"Gathering up all he had learnt during his priesthood of nearly thirty years and concentrating in his mind the treasures of theological science accumulated during as many years of study and teaching, a consummate master in dogmatics and asceticism, an experienced spiritual director, and a contemplative who constantly searched into the mysteries of God, Dom Marmion was now about to give the matured fruits of these years and to be above all among his own monks, the exponent of the Christian and monastic life in its fullness.\\"Thibaut, p. 174. =Maredsous and other communities= In 1909, the government of Belgium asked Maredsous to consider founding a Benedictine monastery in Katanga, in the Belgian Congo.Tierney, Biography, pp. 60 ff. Doubtless Dom Marmion's missionary spirit would not have hesitated; but the Community preferred to devote itself to research and to promotion of sources of the faith, rather than to launch out into direct evangelization. However, Marmion lent effective aid to this mission, which was taken on by the Abbey of Saint Andr√© at Bruges.Tierney, Biography, p. 118. A few years later, Marmion gave help and support to the conversion to Catholicism of Anglican communities in Wales (Caldey and Milford Haven).Tierney, Biography, pp. 70 ff. Marmion \\"played an important part in the celebrated conversion of the monks of Caldey, which constituted a unique event in the history of the Church. It was Dom Marmion who preached the retreat before their abjuration and reception into the Catholic Church.\\" Philipon, pp. 80-81. =First World War (1914-1918)= Disguised as a cattle dealer When war broke out in 1914 Dom Marmion, fearing that his young novices might be called up, sent them to Ireland.Tierney, Biography, pp. 79-81. This involved Marmion traveling, disguised as a cattle dealer, through the war zone from Belgium to England, \\"without passport or papers of any kind.\\"Tierney, Biography, p. 80. When the custom-house officers discovered he had no passport, Marmion was refused entry into England. \\"I am Irish,\\" he told them, \\"and the Irish never have a passport... except for hell, and... it isn't there I am wanting to go.\\" Thibaut reports, \\"This sally provoked a burst of laughter, and he was allowed to pass.\\" Thibaut, p. 184. During the war years Marmion continued his activities as preacher and spiritual director. In 1915 he wrote to a young man preparing for ordination: \\"The best of all preparations for the priesthood is to live each day with love, wherever obedience and Providence place us.\\"Union with God: Letters of Spiritual Direction by Blessed Columba Marmion (Bethesda, Md.: Zaccheus Press, 2006), p. 117 (quoting letter of December 27, 1915). However, the Irish house, established at Edermine, did not give him entire satisfaction; the attitude of the young novices grieved him: \\"I have tried to win them by constancy and prayer, but so far without success. They are good, but full of confidence in themselves... They oppose the letter of Canon Law to the spirit of the Holy Rule.\\"Tierney, Biography, p. 87. The Edermine house was closed in 1920.See Tierney, Biography, pp. 92 ff. =The episode of the Dormition Monastery= After the war, the need to provide replacements for the German monks of the Beuronese congregation who had been expelled from the Benedictine Monastery of the Dormition, on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, made Marmion dream of there being a foundation from Maredsous in the Holy Land. Despite his efforts and the support they gained, this dream was not realized and the German monks returned to the Dormition.Tierney, Biography, pp. 98 ff. =His writings= In 1895, Marmion gave a retreat for a small group of nuns. The notes for those talks contained in kernel an idea he would develop during the next 20 years - meditating upon it in prayer, and refining and polishing it in the many talks he gave as a popular retreat master.Thibaut, p. 107. In its finished form it became Christ, the Life of the Soul (1917) - a book that was first published privately, but then rapidly, unexpectedly, became an \\"overwhelming success\\" in the Catholic world. At the time of its publication, much Catholic literature was a mere \\"rehash... of pious thoughts,\\" marked by a \\"sentimental emphasis,\\" and a tendency towards a sterile \\"refinement of interior analysis.\\" \\"Little attention was paid to the Bible, the Fathers and the great masters of the spiritual life.\\" In this atmosphere, Marmion's work seemed like \\"something new,\\" even \\"revolutionary.\\" \\"It was as if the desert had received its long-awaited rain.\\" His books \\"initiated a profound spiritual revival the influence of which... permeated the whole Catholic world.\\"Philipon, p. 11. Yet there was essentially \\"nothing new\\" in Marmion's work. Rather, his \\"revolution\\" was effected by \\"a return to what was fundamental,\\"Philipon, p. 12. specifically his restoration of \\"Christ as the center of all... spiritual thinking.\\" A second major theme of his work is the doctrine of divine adoption in Christ.See, e.g., Rigali, p. 134. Again, this ideaMarmion summarizes the doctrine of divine adoption as follows: \\"Just as the whole of Christ Jesus can be summed up by His Divine Sonship, so the whole of a Christian can be summed up by participation in this Sonship, through Jesus Christ, in Jesus Christ.\\" Christ, the Life of the Soul, trans. Alan Bancroft (Bethesda, Md.: 2005), p. 28. was not original with Marmion; it is clearly set forth in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of St. Paul.See, e.g., Ephesians 1:3-6: \\"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavens, as He chose us in Him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blemish before Him. In love He destined us for adoption to Himself through Jesus Christ, in accord with the favor of His will, for the praise of the glory of His grace that He granted us in the beloved.\\" But although the doctrine had been addressed by many spiritual writers before him, \\"it would be difficult to find another who had given the mystery such preeminence, making it, as he does, the beginning and the end of the spiritual life. And with Dom Marmion it is not so much a theory or a system, as a living truth that acts directly on the soul.\\"Capelle, p. 19. Some believe the Catholic Church will one day formally declare Marmion the Doctor of Divine Adoption.See, e.g., the remark of Cardinal Justin F. Rigali: \\"I am convinced that he merits the title, which, as a matter of fact, has actually been used for a number of years.... This was l'id√©e ma√Ætresse of his teaching, beautifully and consistently presented throughout all his works, and this is why he is respectfully presented to the determining judgment of the Church as the Doctor of Divine Adoption.\\" Rigali, pp. 132, 135. See also the comment of Dom Mark Tierney, O.S.B., Vice-Postulator of Marmion's Cause for Beatification: \\"[A]fter Marmion‚Äôs beatification on September 3, 2000... I was approached by the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, and invited to work on the process for his Canonization. It was also indicated to me that they hoped one day to declare Marmion a Doctor of the Church ‚Äî The Doctor of Divine Adoption.\\" Christ, the Life of the Soul, Appendix (Bethesda, Md.: Zaccheus Press, 2005), p. 518. His last years Sources for Marmion's thought include, preeminently, the Bible (especially St. Paul and St. John), the Church Fathers, St. Thomas Aquinas, and the Liturgy (i.e., the Mass, the Divine Office, the sacraments),In Catholicism, Liturgy includes \\"the whole complex of official services, all the rites, ceremonies, prayers, and sacraments of the Church,\\" as distinguished from private devotions, such as the Rosary. as well as St. Francis de Sales (1567‚Äì1622) and Msgr. Charles Gay (1815‚Äì1880).See Tierney, Biography, pp. 146-148. As a 20th-century writer, Marmion is notable, perhaps unique, in the several formal and informal endorsements his works have received from the popes of the 20th century, including Benedict XV (1914‚Äì1922),In a private audience with Marmion at the Vatican, Pope Benedict referred to Christ, the Life of the Soul, commenting, \\"It is a great help to me in my spiritual life.\\" At another time he recommended Marmion's work to a visiting archbishop: \\"Read this-it is the pure doctrine of the Church.\\" Thibaut, p. 353. Pius XI (1922‚Äì1939),See Thibaut, p. 353, note 1. Pius XII (1939‚Äì1958),Pope Pius XII stated that the works of Marmion were \\"outstanding in the accuracy of their doctrine, the clarity of their style, and the depth and richness of their thought.\\" Toups, p. 160, note 4. Paul VI (1963‚Äì1978), and John Paul II (1978‚Äì2005). =His last years= With Cardinal Mercier, his friend and confidant, Marmion was a spiritually dominant figure on the Belgian and international scene. The publication of his books had met with \\"immediate and overwhelming success,\\" and they were rapidly being translated into a number of languages, including Korean and Japanese.See Tierney, Biography, p. 7. His influence was at its height, despite his fatigue and a precarious state of health. In September 1922, he took the place of the Bishop of Namur as leader of the diocesan pilgrimage to Lourdes.See Tierney, Biography, pp. 125-126. In October of the same year, he presided at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of Maredsous Abbey (which he had governed as abbot for 14 years).See Tierney, Biography, pp. 126 ff. Marmion was struck during a flu epidemic, and succumbed to bronchial pneumonia on January 30, 1923.See Tierney, Biography, pp. 129-130. Beatification Rapidly, favors and miracles were attributed to him; justifying the transfer, in 1963, of his body from the monks' cemetery to the abbatial church (his body was found to be incorrupt, after more than 40 years).See Morphew, Clark D., \\"Pope declares that healing of a Minnesota woman is a miracle,\\" St. Paul Pioneer Press/Knight Ridder-Tribune News Service, April 1, 2000 (\\"When they opened the coffin, the body was not corrupt\\").

St Laurence's Church, Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, is one of very few surviving Anglo-Saxon churches in England that does not show later medieval alteration or rebuilding. The church is dedicated to St Laurence and documentary sources suggest it may have been founded by Saint Aldhelm around 700, although the architectural style suggests a 10th or 11th century date.Stephanie James, Church of St Laurence, Britannia.com St. Laurence's stands on rising ground close to the larger Norman parish church of the Holy Trinity. The building was used as a combined school (nave) and cottage (chancel) for many years, both on more than one storey.Pevsner & Cherry, 1975, pp.129-131 It was rediscovered in 1856 by William Jones, rector of Holy Trinity, and restored in 1870‚Äì80.Wiltshire Community History In 1952 the church was designated as Grade I listed. The porticus on the northern side of the church. (On the right is the Norman church of the Holy Trinity). The date of the building has been much debated. H. M. Taylor stated some 50 years ago that he believed the main fabric of the walls to their full height belongs to Aldhelm's time, after discussions with Dr Edward Gilbert. Most recent sources give a later date for all or most of the structure.Great English Churches; Anglo-Saxon Churches It has been suggested it was built after 1001, when King √Üthelred the Unready gave the site to the nuns of Shaftesbury Abbey, refugees from the Vikings.Backhouse, Turner, & Webster, 139-141 They were the custodians of the body of King Edward the Martyr, √Üthelred's half-brother and already regarded as a saint, and it may have served as a mortuary chapel for him for a period,Great English Churches which might help explain why such a small but elaborate building was created. It is the most complete Anglo-Saxon survival from this period, and follows what seems to have been a typical monastic plan at the time, though in miniature. In particular the decoration including fragments of large reliefs gives a hint of richness which documentary remains record in monastic churches. Although the existing church seems all or almost all Anglo-Saxon, it has clearly been altered in a number of ways, apart from the modern restoration, which included removing the stairs inside and filling in windows. For its small size, with the nave only some 7.5 metres long and a little over 4 m wide, the height of the building (c. 8m inside the nave) is notable.Anglo-Saxon Churches A porticus to the south has been lost, but otherwise the structure of the building seems complete in its final Anglo- Saxon state. The pair of angels flying horizontally, in relief at about half life-size, probably flanked a large sculptural group of the Crucifixion, perhaps over the chancel arch.Backhouse, Turner and Webster, 130 The arcading on the exterior walls is produced, not by incision (as thought by Jackson and Fletcher),noted architectural historians: Fletcher (Eric George Molyneux) and Jackson (Edward Dudley Colquhoun) but by setting the massive stone pilaster- strips forward from the wall-face. In this they are similar to Great Dunham and the tower of Tasburgh parish church in Norfolk, and also to the parish churches at Earls Barton and Barton-upon-Humber.

It was one of several manufacturers - the first appearing in the early 1940s - that converted BMW or other motorcycles into light utility three-wheelers. In 1965 it entirely designed and built a small five- seat passenger car with a BMW 125cc motorcycle engine. Although the type was certified, only one was built due to problems in availability of parts for further production. Following this design, three-wheeled truck models were developed and produced. A second passenger car model was designed and introduced in 1973, known as model 500, with a Fiat 500cc engine. With metal body, seating up to five passengers and featuring very good road handling, it was a rather advanced three-wheeler for its time. It was certified for production and 15 were built, of which one survives to this date in excellent condition. There were even talks with a South African company involving plans for exports or even transfer of production to that country, but they were never realized. The company ceased production in 1975.

Here any salmon swimming near the surface are surrounded with a wall of netting, supported by floats. A surrounding net is a fishing net which surrounds fish and other aquatic animals on the sides and underneath. It is typically used by commercial fishers, and pulled along the surface of the water. There is typically a purse line at the bottom, which is closed when the net is hauled in. A surrounding net is deployed by a fishing boat that starts sailing in a circle. This allows for the net to come all the way around 360 degrees to completely surround the fish. This makes it so that there is no escape for the fish. There are floating buoys on the top of the net and weights on the bottom of the net to make sure that it forms a wall. This is one of the easiest ways to trap a school of fish. As stated above, a seine net is one of the most common types of surrounding nets used in the commercial fishing industry. One negative of surrounding nets is the fact that they might catch an animal that they are not intentionally trying to catch, but this does not happen all that often.

In 1292 it belonged to Glastonbury Abbey and was valued at 35 marks. The tower is from 1446, has a clock from the 17th century and a ring of 8 bells hung for change ringing, the earliest of which dates from 1716. That bell, the fourth of the ring, and the seventh (1717) were cast by the first Abraham Rudhall of the bellfounders Rudhall of Gloucester.

Ji-li Jiang was very important in her classroom and was respected until 1966 when the Cultural Revolution started. In Red Scarf Girl, Ji-li was at the top of her class and the da-dui-zhang, or Student Council President, of her school. However, her father prevents her from auditioning for the Central Liberation Army Arts Academy due to their political status, which she had no knowledge of at the time. Her family is considered a \\"Black Family,\\" because her grandfather was a landlord and her father was considered a \\"rightist\\", though her father reassured her that he is not. Many people accuse Ji-li of her family's old ways, or \\"Four Olds\\" and the \\"Five Black Categories\\" that Chairman Mao Zedong protests against. Ji-li must deal with the difficult choice between her educational and political future or her family. This book describes her experiences with the Cultural Revolution, including being betrayed by her classmates, helping to destroy the Four Olds, attempting to become a Red Guard and the constant terror of arrest. Though, towards the end, Jiang Ji-li realizes that her goals no longer define her but rather her responsibilities. Development Jiang decided to write while she was in a training program for managing hotels; she felt inspiration from reading the Diary of Anne Frank while at university but at the time did not have sufficient free time to begin writing on her own. She cited a goal to educate Americans about China as a motive for writing the book. Summary At the setting, during the summer, the Cultural Revolution has just begun. The story scopes on Ji-Li Jiang, the main character of the story. Ji-li is very happy and excited when a Liberation Army Officer comes to her school and shows her approval of Ji-li's handstand. Principal Long invites her and other students to audition. She passes the test and is very excited to tell her parents about the good news. However, Ji-li is dissuaded by her parents, who know their \\"black\\" background will prevent her from making it in, and everyone at school will know her family's political status. The Campaign Against the \\"Four Olds\\" is illustrated when she, her younger brother and sister, her friends, and her classmates watch as a crowd tears down a \\"superstitious\\" store sign and enthusiastically destroys it. The Da-zi-bao craze then begins, and everyone in her class is assigned to write these posters. Some very easily write horrendous slanders against the teachers, but Ji-li cannot bring herself to insult her teachers. One day, she sees a da-zi-bao implying she has a relationship with a male teacher, and her parents tell her to stay at home to avoid embarrassment. When she comes to school again, she is nominated to become a Red Successor for the future generation of Red Guards but her bad class background is revealed to the class by Du Hai, the boy in her class described as \\"trouble\\" by Ji-li, and she is excluded from the nomination. Ji- li finds out that her grandfather is a landlord and her father is being labeled a rightist, although he is not. She is devastated because of this, but knows she can do nothing about it because her father informed her earlier in the book that it was not a good idea to audition and try out even though she had good potential. The summer starts off a bit disappointing for Ji-Li because graduation tests are terminated, but she then finds out that she is going to Shi-yi Junior High School because of her teachers' recommendations. Unfortunately, her teacher's recommendations to schools become invalidated and everyone in her neighborhood is forced to go to Xin-zhaRed Scarf Girl Junior High School because of the region that they had residence in. Soon, the campaign started promoting house searches for \\"Four Olds\\" items and treasures. Song Po-po, their housekeeper, is eventually fired due to the family's fear of being accused of exploiting workers. Then, the Red Guards find a knife in the garbage with some of their family's suspicious burnt photos. Six Fingers accompanied by several Red Guards start their raid when the Jiangs are asleep. Their house is trashed and they lose many of their things that were considered \\"Four Olds.\\" Ji-Li comes to junior high school after the summer. Her father is detained for \\"establishing counterrevolutionary ties and listening to foreign radio.\\" Her mother's salary is also reduced. Their family is going through their darkest ages. When the Red Guards come to search their house for an incriminating letter and evidence of their luxurious, \\"bourgeois\\" lifestyle and exploitation of others, they destroy and take away many of their belongings. However, they manage to hold on and not give up. All schools are then closed and Ji-Li and her classmates are sent to the countryside to do hard labor on the fields. She comes back and takes care of her family, choosing not to betray her father when requested to criticize him. Eventually, Ji-Li moves to the United States of America.

Each series is six episodes long; one special aired in December 1998. Heartburn Hotel was written by John Sullivan and Steve Glover; it starred Tim Healy as the hotel's proprietor. The first series premiered on BBC One at 10 PM on 20 July 1998. The second series aired from 23 June to 28 July 2000, at a 10:20 PM time slot. Characters Harry Springer and Duggie Strachan are the main protagonists in the comedy. After both characters were involved in the Falklands conflict they both move back to Birmingham, Harry to own the Olympic Hotel and Duggie to become a teacher. These two characters take opposing viewpoints in almost every matter and although Harry pretends to sympathise with his customers, his views are radically right wing as opposed to Duggie who emphatically empathises due to his own plight brought about by his gambling addiction. The reason Duggie accepts his landlords overbearing boorishness dates back to the Falklands whereupon Harry saved his life, a fact that Harry does not let Duggie forget.

The Short Sandringham was on a Norwegian domestic flight from Oslo and was landing in the bay adjacent to Hommelvik near the city of Trondheim. The disaster killed 19 people; among the survivors was the philosopher Bertrand Russell.  Aircraft  The flying boat was a Short Sandringham, registration LN-IAW and named Bukken Bruse after the fairy tale \\"The Three Billy Goats Gruff\\". The aircraft, operated by Det Norske Luftfartsselskap (now a part of Scandinavian Airlines System) was en route from Oslo's Fornebu Airport. Crash The weather in the area of the landing was poor at the time, and the sea in the bay of Hommelvika was foaming white. When the Sandringham was about to touch down on the water, it was hit by a wind gust; the pilots lost control and the right wing float broke off as it hit the water. The aircraft rolled over to the side and its nose ploughed into the water. The fuselage rapidly filled with water. Of the 45 people on board, 19 perished. The survivors were all in the smoking compartment at the back of the cabin, near the emergency exit. =Bertrand Russell's account= The 76-year-old philosopher Bertrand Russell was on the flight on his way to give a lecture to the local student society. He was seated at the rear of the smoking compartment. In an interview with Trondheim newspaper Adresseavisen the day after the crash, he said that he was uncertain of what was happening after the jerk until the aircraft tipped over and water rushed in. In his autobiography he wrote that he had made sure to get a seat in the smoking compartment before the flight, saying that \\"If I cannot smoke, I should die\\". Russell was hospitalized in a Trondheim hospital.The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, p. 512 Cause The investigation found that the crash was caused by the pilot's loss of control during his attempt to land the Sandringham in a crosswind and rough seas with limited space available.

Biography The Coxe family traced their lineage to a Daniel Coxe who lived in Somersetshire, England in the 13th century and obtained a doctor of medicine degree from Salerno University. Daniel Coxe's father was also called Daniel Coxe. He was from Stoke Newington, London and died in 1686. Daniel Coxe the son was born in London, the oldest of thirteen children, and was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge where he became a doctor of medicine in 1669. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the Royal College of Physicians (Coxe is the Society member referred to by Samuel Pepys in his diary entry of 3 May 1665 when he poisons a cat with tobacco oil at Gresham College). Coxe was appointed a physician to the court of King Charles II of England and later to that of Queen Anne. Colonial landowner Coxe never left England, he served nominally as Governor of New Jersey by purchase of land. He then bought other land in the Mississippi Valley. He attempted to settle a colony of Huguenots in Virginia, but failed. Initially Coxe purchased land in West Jersey in the mid-1680s. He bought out the heirs of Edward Byllynge there in 1687. Coxe opened the earliest commercial-scale pottery in New Jersey.Ceramics - Daniel Coxe, Burlington , Art & Architecture of New Jersey. URL accessed on 7 March 2006. He sold out most of his land there to the West New Jersey Society of London, in 1692. Later in the 1690s Coxe acquired a grant of land in 1698 known as \\"Carolana\\" which had been given by Charles I to Sir Robert Heath; this he purchased from Sir James Shaen, or his son Arthur; Shaen had acquired the rights from Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk.Clarence Walworth Alvord, Lee Bidgood, The First Explorations of the Trans-Allegheny Region by the Virginians, 1650-1674 (1912), p. 241; archive.org. The Carolana holding remained with the Coxe family until 1769 when it was exchanged for land in the Mohawk valley of what is now New York state. Later life Coxe died in 1730, and was buried in London, England. His portrait is held by the Royal College of Physicians in London. Family Coxe married Rebecca Coldham (only surviving child and heiress of John Coldham, Esquire of Tooting Graveney, Alderman of London and Rebecca Wood) on 12 May 1671. They had a son Colonel Daniel Coxe and a daughter Mary. Daniel Coxe, Jr.(1673‚Äì1739), with an agent John Tatham, went to his father's North American lands. He lived in the American colonies from 1702 to 1716 and after returning to England published an account in 1722 of his travels and a description of the area encompassed by his father's claim, entitled A Description of the English Province of Carolana, by the Spaniards called Florida, And by the French La Louisiane. He was appointed by the Duke of Norfolk as Provincial Grand Master of Freemasons for the provinces of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but died before he had chartered any lodges. In 1731, he claimed that he possessed superior title to that of the West Jersey Society, via a superseding deed that his father had recorded years earlier; the courts upheld Coxe's claim. Hundreds of families were forced to repurchase their own property from Col. Coxe or be forcibly evicted. The ensuing scandal was one of many injustices that inflamed American anger against the British during the years leading up the Revolutionary War. There were lawsuits; there were riots; Col. Coxe was burned in effigy; but to no avail. As a result, many Hopewell residents left New Jersey, either unable to pay Col. Coxe or disgusted with the colony's rampant political corruption. One group of Hopewell expatriates settled on the Yadkin River in what was then Rowan County, NC. This community, the Jersey Settlement, continued to attract new settlers from the Hopewell area for several decades. Mary became a Maid of Honour to Queen Caroline, the wife of King George II and later married John Montgomery (died 1733) in 1732 and had a son Alexander, who were both M.P.'s for County Monaghan in Ireland. After Col. John Montgomery's death she married William Clement LL.D. Vice Provost of Trinity College, Dublin and M.P. both for the College and the City of Dublin. She died at Beaulieu, Co. Louth in 1790 aged 97 years.

It is the country's largest airport and, as of 2017, the only one receiving regularly scheduled services. History The airport was constructed by the Italian colonial authorities in 1922, the first such facility to be opened in Italian Eritrea with the name \\"Aeroporto di Gura\\". It served as the main military airport in the territory. In the mid-1930s, the airport (enlarged and now called Aeroporto Civile Umberto Maddalena di Asmara) began offering civilian and commercial flights. On 7 July 1935, an agreement was signed with British \\"Imperial Airways\\" to connect Asmara to Khartoum. A regular Kassala-Khartoum-Asmara-Massawa 770 km commercial route was subsequently started with a Caproni 133 of the Italian Ala Littoria. Additionally, a regular Asmara-Assab- Mogadishu commercial route was started in summer 1935, with an Ala Littoria's Caproni Ca.133 providing 13-hour flights from the Mogadishu airport to Italian Eritrea. The aircraft had a maximal capacity of 18 passengers, which at the time was a record. In 1936, Ala Littoria launched an intercontinental connection -called \\"Linea dell'Impero\\"- between Mogadishu-Asmara-Khartoum-Tripoli and Rome. The voyage lasted four days and was one of the first long range flights in the world. During World War II, the airport was nearly destroyed by the British. It was later renovated in the 1950s, and reopened to offer flights to Addis Ababa and other cities in Ethiopia. With Eritrea's independence in the 1990s, the airport became an international portal to the new nation. During the Eritrean- Ethiopian War, the airport was bombed two times by Ethiopia. The first was in 1998 and another in 2000. In April 2003, after improvements to the airport's runways, Eritrean Airlines started regular services between Asmara and Frankfurt, Milan, Nairobi and Rome. In 2004, it served 136,526 passengers (+11.8% vs. 2003). in 2018, after renewed relations with Ethiopia, the airport started accepting flights from Addis Ababa for the first time since the war Facilities The airport has capacity restrictions due to its small terminal, short runway and high 1.5-mile (2300m.) altitude. Consequently, some large jet aircraft (like an A380, MD-11 or 747) cannot fly to the airport. Unsuitable aircraft would instead need to use the Massawa International Airport on the Eritrean coast. Lufthansa, however, operated Airbus A340 aircraft on a FRA-JED-ASM service as recently as 2012. The airport is also an Eritrean Air Force base.

First years Augustus was born in Freiberg, the youngest child and third (but second surviving) son of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony, and Catherine of Mecklenburg. He consequently belonged to the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin. Brought up as a Lutheran, he received a good education and studied at the university of Leipzig. When Duke Henry IV died in 1541, he decreed that his lands should be divided equally between his two sons; but as his bequest was contrary to the Albertine Law, it was not carried out, and the dukedom passed almost intact to his elder son, Maurice. Augustus, however, remained on friendly terms with his brother, and to further his policy spent some time at the court of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, in Vienna. In 1544, Maurice secured the appointment of his brother as administrator of the bishopric of Merseburg; but Augustus was very extravagant and was soon compelled to return to the Saxon court at Dresden. Augustus supported his brother during the war of the Schmalkaldic League, and in the policy which culminated in the transfer of the Saxon electorate from John Frederick I, the head of the Ernestine branch of the Wettin family, to Maurice, head of the Albertine branch. =Marriage and children= In Torgau on 7 October 1548 Augustus was married to Anna, daughter of King Christian III of Denmark and Dorothea of Saxe- Lauenburg. They took up residence at Weissenfels. The couple had fifteen children: #John Henry (b. Weissenfels, 5 May 1550 ‚Äì d. Weissenfels, 12 November 1550). #Eleonore (b. Wolkenstein, 2 May 1551 ‚Äì d. Wolkenstein, 24 April 1553). #Elisabeth (b. Wolkenstein, 18 October 1552 ‚Äì d. imprisoned in Heidelberg, 2 April 1590), married on 4 June 1570 to Count Palatine Johann Casimir of Simmern; they were separated in 1589. #Alexander (b. Dresden, 21 February 1554 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 8 October 1565), Hereditary Prince of Saxony. #Magnus (b. Dresden, 24 September 1555 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 6 November 1558). #Joachim (b. Dresden, 3 May 1557 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 21 November 1557). #Hector (b. Dresden, 7 October 1558 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 4 April 1560). #Christian I (b. Dresden, 29 October 1560 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 25 September 1591), successor of his father in the Electorship. #Marie (b. Torgau, 8 March 1562 ‚Äì d. Torgau, 6 January 1566). #Dorothea (b. Dresden, 4 October 1563 ‚Äì d. Wolfenb√ºttel, 13 February 1587), married on 26 September 1585 to Duke Heinrich Julius of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel. #Amalie (b. Dresden, 28 January 1565 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 2 July 1565). #Anna (b. Dresden, 16 November 1567 ‚Äì d. imprisoned in Veste Coburg, 27 January 1613), married on 16 January 1586 to Duke John Casimir, Duke of Saxe- Coburg-Eisenach; they divorced in 1593. #Augustus (b. Dresden, 23 October 1569 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 12 February 1570). #Adolf (b. Stolpen, 8 August 1571 ‚Äì d. Dresden, 12 March 1572). #Frederick (b. Annaberg, 18 June 1575 ‚Äì d. Annaberg, 24 January 1577). Soon after his marriage, Augustus desired a more imposing establishment. The result was that Maurice made more generous provision for his brother, who acted as Regent of Saxony in 1552 during the absence of the elector. Augustus was on a visit to Denmark when by Maurice's death in July 1553 he became elector of Saxony. Elector of Saxony Augustus as depicted on a 1582 thaler, minted in Dresden The first care of the new elector was to come to terms with John Frederick, and to strengthen his own hold upon the electoral position. This object was secured by a treaty made at Naumburg in February 1554, when, in return for the grant of Altenburg and other lands, John Frederick recognized Augustus as elector of Saxony. The elector, however, was continually haunted by the fear that the Ernestines would attempt to deprive him of the coveted dignity, and his policy both in Saxony and the wider Holy Roman Empire was coloured by this fear. In imperial politics Augustus acted upon two main principles: to cultivate the friendship of the Habsburgs, and to maintain peace between the contending religious parties. To this policy may be traced his share in bringing about the religious Peace of Augsburg treaty in 1555, his tortuous conduct at the diet of Augsburg eleven years later, and his reluctance to break entirely with the Calvinists. His policy of religious peace was also promoted by the marriage he negotiated between his niece Anna and the then-Catholic Prince of Orange, at the time one of the chief Habsburg vassals in the Netherlands, in 1561. On one occasion only did he waver in his allegiance to the Habsburgs. In 1568 a marriage was arranged between Johann Casimir, son of Frederick III, Elector Palatine, and Elisabeth, Augustus' own daughter. For a time it seemed possible that the Saxon elector would support his son-in-law in his attempts to aid the revolting inhabitants of the Spanish Netherlands. Augustus also entered into communication with the Huguenots; however, his aversion to foreign complications prevailed, and the incipient friendship with the elector Palatine soon gave way to serious dislike. Although a sturdy Lutheran, the elector hoped at one time to unite the Protestants. He continually urged them to consider the necessity of giving no cause of offence to their opponents, and he favoured the movement to get rid of the clause in the Peace of Augsburg concerning ecclesiastical reservation, which was offensive to many Protestants. His moderation, however, prevented him from joining those who were prepared to take strong measures to attain this end, and he refused to jeopardize the concessions already won. Religious policies August von Sachsen (painting by Lucas Cranach the Younger, 1572, Stadt- und Bergbaumuseum in Freiberg) The hostility between the Albertines and the Ernestines gave Augustus serious trouble. A preacher named Matthias Flacius held an influential position in ducal Saxony, and taught a form of Lutheranism different from that taught in the Electorate of Saxony. This breach was widened when Flacius began to make personal attacks on Augustus, to prophesy his speedy downfall, and to incite Duke John Frederick to make an effort to recover his rightful position. Associated with Flacius was a knight, Wilhelm von Grumbach, who, not satisfied with words only, made inroads into the Electorate of Saxony and sought the aid of foreign powers in his plan to depose Augustus. After some delay Grumbach and his protector, John Frederick, were placed under the imperial ban, and Augustus was entrusted with its execution. His campaign in 1567 was short and successful. John Frederick surrendered, and passed his time in prison until his death in 1595; Grumbach was taken and executed; and the position of the elector was made quite secure. The form of Lutheranism taught in the Electorate of Saxony was that of Melanchthon, and many of its teachers and adherents, such as Caspar Peucer and Johann St√∂ssel, afterwards called Crypto-Calvinists, were favoured by the elector. The Crypto-Calvinists were confident that they would be able to bring Augustus over to their Calvinizing positions by convincing Augustus that they were in fact merely loyal Lutherans, when in fact they were working to introduce Calvinist views of the Lord's Supper, and the doctrine of predestination at the University of Wittenberg. Augustus at first was deceived. Spurred on by his wife the matter reached a climax in 1574, when letters were discovered, which, while revealing a hope to bring over Augustus to Calvinism, cast some aspersions upon the elector and his wife. Augustus ordered the leaders of the Crypto-Calvinists to be seized, and they were tortured and imprisoned. He restored genuine Lutheranism to Saxony and began to work on a way to bring unity among Lutherans by commencing a process that would lead to the publication, in 1580, of the Lutheran Book of Concord. Augustus personally sponsored the publication of the Book of Concord, a book containing the various Lutheran Confessions of faith, which was signed by over 8,100 ministers and professors and nearly 30 territories, states and cities in Germany. This strict form of Lutheranism was declared binding upon all the inhabitants of Saxony, and many persons were banished from the country. The change in Saxony, however, made no difference to the attitude of Augustus on imperial questions. In 1576 he opposed the proposal of the Protestant princes to make a grant for the War against the Ottoman Empire conditional upon the abolition of the clause concerning ecclesiastical reservation, and he continued to support the Habsburgs. Territorial expansion Much of the elector's time was devoted to extending his territories. In 1573 he became guardian to the two sons of John William, duke of Saxe-Weimar, and in this capacity was able to add part of the county of Henneberg to the Electorate of Saxony. His command of money enabled him to take advantage of the poverty of his neighbours, and in this way he secured Vogtland and the county of Mansfeld. In 1555 he had appointed one of his nominees to the bishopric of Meissen, in 1561 he had secured the election of his son Alexander as bishop of Merseburg, and three years later as bishop of Naumburg; and when this prince died in 1565 these bishoprics came under the direct rule of Augustus. Second marriage and death On 1 October 1585 the Electress Anna died. Three months later, on 3 January 1586, in the city of Dessau, Augustus married secondly with Agnes Hedwig, a daughter of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt. The bride was only 13 years; the groom, almost 60. August died one month after his new marriage, and was buried at Freiberg Cathedral. His only surviving son, Christian I, was his successor. Writing and collections Augustus wrote a small work on agriculture entitled K√ºnstlich Obstund Gartenb√ºchlein. He was famous for his various museum collections, including the finest collection of arms and weapons in Northern Europe, paintings, and an extensive collection of tools. In 1560 he founded the Dresden Kunstkammer, the predecessor of the present day State Collections. One of his possessions, a clockwork automaton called the Mechanical Galleon is now in the British Museum. This table decoration played music, told the time and showed Augustus and the other six electors parading before the Roman Emperor. Ancestors References Sources * This cites: ** C. W.

History Pashkevich-Erivan Square in the 1870s The square was originally named after Ivan Paskevich, the Count of Erivan, a Ukrainian general in the Russian Imperial Army, who earned his title in honor of his conquest of Erivan (present-day Yerevan) for the Russian Empire. During the Soviet era, the square was renamed twice:, first to \\"Beria Square\\", and then \\"Lenin Square\\". The location was first named Freedom Square in 1918, during the foundation of the First Georgian Republic following the collapse of the Russian Empire. Freedom Square was the site of the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery. Freedom Square has also been the site of various mass demonstrations including those for Georgia's independence (from the Soviet Union), the Rose Revolution, and others. In 2005 Freedom Square was the location where U.S. President George W. Bush and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili addressed a crowd of around 100,000 people in celebration of the 60th anniversary marking the end of World War II. During this event, Georgian- Armenian Vladimir Arutyunian threw a live grenade at President Bush while he was speaking in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate him. Monuments Abutting the north side of Freedom Square is a small open space with a fountain and a bust of Alexander Pushkin.

Since 2015, Babestation has also had a complementary website that includes more options than those available on the TV channel. The television version was the first show of its kind in the UK allowing viewers to communicate live with female presenters via a premium-rate telephone number or text messaging. It is broadcast daily, and since 2006 has had a dedicated channel on Sky. Its sister stations and websites are more hardcore in nature but the main programme shown on TV is also streamed on the Internet via the babestation.com website. History Babestation began in late 2002, as a post-watershed two-hour programme (11 pm ‚Äì 1 am) on computer game channel Game Network UK. Babestation featured two women taking calls (unheard by the TV audience) whilst the rest of the screen was filled by viewers' text messages and one presenter, who improvised and reacted to the messages. On some occasions the three women on screen would take turns as presenter. The programme proved profitable to the channel and Babestation's makers. In time, Babestation was given bigger time-slots, becoming a three- and then four-hour-long show (11 pm ‚Äì 3 am), increasing the number of presenters to four or five per night, and improving the technology (the director could now put women on full screen, having only been able to show them on one-sixth of it before, and hand-held cameras were introduced, replacing the poorer-quality static remote-controlled ones that were originally used). Babestation was also sometimes broadcast on the Italian feed of Game Network. This, along with Game Network's waning commitment to video gaming programmes (Psychic Interactive was also given a large amount of airtime), caused Game Network to cease to exist in the UK. On 20 February 2006, the channel's name changed to Babestation, and on 28 February the channel was moved by Sky to the new \\"Adult\\" section of channels. It is also available on Free-to-air channels under the Adult Section. Babestation is now owned and operated by Cellcast PLC, a company which was co-founded by Andrew Wilson and Bertrand Folliet in 2002.Extracted from \\"Interactive TV, the unlikely sexual revolution\\". David Nugus 2013 A new type of show Babestation was a unique style of TV programme in Britain. Despite not being popular, and having low production values, Babestation produced many clones that can all be seen as originating from its format. These programmes all differ slightly in format and explicitness ‚Äì Babestation generally does not show genitals or sex toys, or contain very strong language; since 2004 camera phone technology has been used to allow viewers to send in pictures of themselves; and the show has always featured adverts for similar services in its commercial breaks. But the idea is the same ‚Äì live, simulated sex interspersed with unscripted conversation, advertising a premium rate number to phone the women, which makes it a profitable business. Charlie Brooker of The Guardian accused both presenters and viewers of being \\"thick\\" and referred to viewers \\"begging them to blow kisses and jiggle about a bit\\". David Nugus author of a privately published study into TV/phone sex channels (Spring 2013), conducted many interviews with the presenters. He found them to be articulate with considerable personality, a necessity for the success of such channels. \\"Interactive TV, the unlikely sexual revolution\\" David Nugus 2013. Masti Chat Masti Chat was a daily program on Babestation which allowed viewers to connect with British Asian women. The name is derived from the Hindi word ‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä ', meaning \\"fun.\\" The program aired in a pre-watershed slot from 1pm till 9pm every day. A night show with more raunchy content was broadcast on Babestation 2 every so often. Masti Chat was axed in early 2014 and many of the women left. Some of the women remain on Babestation Daytime. Dirty Wives Dirty Wives was a show on the Sky version of Babestation 2 that was on once or twice a week in the night hours. The programme featured some of the best mature women (40+).

It is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice. History and design MCC Chicago was designed by architect Harry Weese. Construction began in 1971 and the facility opened in 1975. The building is a right triangle shape, extrudes 28 stories, and has a rooftop exercise yard. The irregularly-spaced windows on each wall are reminiscent of old computer punchcards.The MCC: Chicago‚Äôs Jailhouse Skyscraper (Episode 26), 99% Invisible, 20 May 2011 Several features make MCC Chicago's design unique from other federal prison facilities. Weese designed each cell with a floor-to-ceiling slit window, long by wide, narrow enough not to require bars, and beveled out to allow natural light to pass inside. The cells were originally designed to feel as comfortable as possible, based on sailboat cabins, with built-in hardwood beds and desks. Most of these features have since been removed. Prison life An exercise yard is available for inmates, located on the roof of the building. This rooftop yard is enclosed by tall concrete walls with fenced openings. A recreation center in the basement provides fitness equipment on a regular schedule, along with a selection of board games. The leisure and law libraries are housed on the ninth floor along with classrooms and offices. There is a security housing unit (SHU) for male prisoners, while female prisoners needing to be isolated, as of 2005, have been taken to the Cook County Jail.Kerman, Piper.

Notable events =1985 escapes= In 1985, convicted murderers Bernard Welch and Hugh Colomb assembled the materials necessary to break open a window hole and gain egress from the MCC, escaping down a piecework rope to street level. They were eventually recaptured after a months-long nationwide manhunt. =2009 escape plot= In October 2009, Matthew Nolan (28750-045), brother of film director Christopher Nolan, assembled bedsheets and other materials for a foiled window escape plan that was later called \\"impossible\\" by the judge who sentenced Nolan to 14 months for the attempt. Nolan was being held at the MCC awaiting extradition to Costa Rica on a passport charge (his charges having been reduced from earlier capital offenses) at the time of the foiled plot. =Vicente Zambada-Niebla lawsuit= In February 2010, Sinaloa Cartel leader Vicente Zambada-Niebla was apprehended by Mexican police and extradited to Chicago to face trial. Considered a high security risk, he was placed in solitary confinement. Based on intelligence that allies of Zambada-Niebla were planning a helicopter escape, Zambada-Niebla was not allowed access to the rooftop exercise yard. Bureau of Prisons officials cited the fact that the Sinaloa Cartel has unlimited resources and has succeeded in both escapes and assassinations in the past. Zambada-Niebla sued the Bureau of Prisons in 2011 claiming that his being denied exercise constituted cruel and unusual punishment. In September 2011, US District Judge Ruben Castillo ruled that since Zambada-Niebla had not been convicted, placing him in solitary confinement was unwarranted. In order to comply with the ruling and alleviate security concerns, the Bureau of Prisons transferred Zambada-Niebla to the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, a medium-security facility in Michigan which has a ground-level exercise area. =2012 escape= In the early morning hours of December 18, 2012, two convicted bank robbers, Kenneth Conley (28560-298) and Joseph \\"Jose\\" Banks (22652-424), escaped the secure facility. Conley and Banks were being housed in the MCC while awaiting sentencing on their bank robbery convictions, crimes which were unrelated beyond the pair being cellmates at the MCC. The escape by Banks and Conley was the first from any secure federal correctional facility since April 2006, when convicted murderer Richard Lee McNair escaped from the U.S. Penitentiary, Pollock, Louisiana. The pair ostensibly fashioned a rope from bedsheets or fabric scraps, and exited their 17th-floor cell through a hole created at the bottom of a narrow window slot, rappelling down the side of the MCC to the street below. Their escape and the gaping hole in the prison wall apparently went unnoticed during routine overnight bed checks, and was only discovered when arriving jail workers spotted the rope dangling down the side of the MCC at about 7:00 am. The inmates had obtained and concealed large numbers of bedsheets, fake iron window bars used to mimic the real bars they removed and hid, passable street clothing, and bulky materials used to fool guards into believing they were asleep in bed. It is unclear what tools were used to create the hole in the wall necessary for the escape, and if these had been hidden in the cell for an extended period of time. Conley and Banks were subsequently recorded on a nearby video security system as they entered a cab at the corner of Congress Parkway and Michigan Avenue at about 2:40 am. In the video, they were wearing some form of light-colored plain clothes, and not their bright-orange, prison-issue jumpsuits. The identity of the cab driver and cab company, as well as how the convicts paid the cab fare, remained unclear. On December 20, 2012, Banks was recaptured by FBI agents and the Chicago police in the 2300 block of North Bosworth Avenue. On January 3, 2013, Conley was apprehended in Palos Hills, Illinois. Conley and Banks are currently incarcerated at Florence ADX, the supermax facility in Colorado which holds the most dangerous inmates in the federal system, as well as inmates who constitute a high escape risk. Their release dates are in 2032 and 2040. Banks filed a $10 million lawsuit in 2014 for negligence for allowing him to escape. The lawsuit was dismissed by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.Court tosses $10m suit\\", chicago.cbslocal.com, September 25, 2015.

He lives with his family in Combermere, Ontario, Canada. O'Brien's books have been published in a number of foreign languages, including Croatian, Czech, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish.

He attended a residential school in Inuvik, where he says he was abused by a dormitory supervisor. He graduated from grade 12 at St Patrick's College High School only with difficulty. As a youth, he was agnostic, leaning towards atheism, until his conversion to Catholicism when he was 21. He began to draw and paint shortly after, and had a successful gallery exhibition. Five years later, at the urging of his wife, he began to turn his artwork towards religious subjects. In 1994, at the age of 46, he began to write, although he had never been a writer before.

Between 11 September 1933 and November 1964 there was a small halt (at ), although this was only half a mile to the east of the existing Magor railway station. This halt, like Caldicot, consisted of little more than two wooden platforms made from old sleepers and a footbridge. From 1941 the main line was doubled to four running lines, with the outer two lines as slow goods-only lines to serve the increasing wartime coal traffic, without delaying fast trains on the central main lines.

G. Wodehouse. A journalist turned detective, he is a rather weak and unpleasant man, generally disliked by all. He appears in several novels, but is perhaps best known for his involvement with the denizens of Blandings Castle, in Summer Lightning (1929) and Heavy Weather (1933). Character Pilbeam is a rather slimy-looking man, with shiny black hair in a marcelled wave, eyes a little too close together, pimples and a shabby-looking moustache (which is occasionally described as \\"fungoid\\"). He has a tendency to dress in rather loud check suits, and a taste for pretty girls. He has an efficient and practical mind, full of pep and vigour. A member of the \\"Junior Constitutional Club\\", and an F.R.Z.S., Pilbeam is also a keen motorcyclist. His taste for girls is clear in his approval of Miss \\"Flick\\" Sheridan, and his adoration and pursuit of Sue Brown (which enrages Ronnie Fish to the extent of running amok and destroying a restaurant). Pilbeam has a paralysing fear of pigs, having read once that a pig, on finding a stranger in its sty, will go for him like a tiger and tear him to ribbons. He has a fondness for champagne, a drink he finds highly useful in priming himself for tense meetings with the nobility.

Career Pilbeam is introduced in Bill the Conqueror, at which time he is deputy to Roderick Pyke as editor of Society Spice, but considered a far more capable and trustworthy man by Roderick's father, Lord Tilbury, head of the Mammoth Publishing Company. Tilbury trusts Pilbeam with many a delicate task, and is rarely disappointed by the young man's work. After Roderick leaves his father's employ, Pilbeam takes over as head of Society Spice, in which position we hear of him in passing in Sam the Sudden. He spends some three years there, during which he incurs the wrath of Galahad Threepwood. He leaves his job, much to Lord Tilbury's indignation, to found the Argus Detective Agency, which he runs from offices in an alley off Beeston Street, in South- West London, telegraphic address \\"Pilgus Piccy\\". He was hired, in the early days of the organisation, to retrieve some compromising letters for Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, a task he achieved by impersonating a man come to read the gas meter and breaking into a safe. We hear about this later, in Summer Lightning, when Parsloe-Parsloe hires him once more to steal Galahad Threepwood's scandalous book of reminiscences, just after Lord Emsworth has called him in to investigate the disappearance of his prize pig, Empress of Blandings, and Millicent Threepwood has had him tail her fianc√© Hugo Carmody. His time at Blandings Castle is somewhat tense, with Carmody, Galahad and Ronnie Fish holding grudges against him, and he feels entirely out of place and uncomfortable amongst the well-bred, well-dressed Threepwood family and their friends. However, he remains there into the events of Heavy Weather, when he is once again asked to steal Galahad's book by Parsloe-Parsloe. For a time he has hopes of making a large sum of money from the book, but his hopes are dashed; however, he does get well rewarded, when he agrees to employ Monty Bodkin in his detective agency.

It is located about south east of Newport city centre on the Caldicot Levels, a large area of coastal land reclaimed from the sea. Administratively, Whitson is part of the community of Goldcliff.  Origin of the name  Sir Joseph Bradney, in his 1922 \\"History of Monmouthshire\\", is undecided on the derivation of the name of the manor and surrounding village, but notes early spellings such as Witston, Widson and Wyttston. It seems most likely, however, that the name came from \\"Whitestone\\", similar to the adjacent \\"Goldcliff\\". In 1358 the manor was held \\"...by John de Saint Maur of Penhow of Peter de Cusance by knight service, as of his manor of Langstone\\". In the 18th and 19th centuries the Phillips family owned a large estate in the parish and lived at what was then called \\"Whitson House\\" (see \\"Whitson Court\\" below).  Character  Together with the neighbouring larger parishes of Nash and Goldcliff it is one of the so-called \\"Three Parishes\\" which have long been treated as a unit - geographically, socially, economically and ecclesiastically. At high-tide much of the land in the village is below sea-level. A main drainage ditch, with an origin near Llanwern, known as \\"Monksditch\\" or \\"Goldcliff Pill\\" (\\"P√Æl\\" is a word found across the Gwent and Glamorgan coast, apparently meaning an inlet or haven off the Severn or Bristol Channel) passes through the village on its way to the sea. Local folklore maintains that the sides of the Monksditch are laced with smuggler's brandy. The main part of the village has the houses and farmsteads set back from the road in long strips of pasture reflecting a medieval 'cope' land allocation pattern, similar to that used in land reclamation in Holland.British Archaeology, No 11, February 1996: A land shaped by generations past The real outpost of the village is the remote Porton House, situated next to the sea and accessed from Great Porton. Historically Porton has been part of Goldcliff and may have once had its own separate church, although confusion with Whitson church seems more likely. For many years Porton, like Goldcliff, was the site of a salmon fishery.  History  Mr & Mrs John Knox Richards Phillips outside Whitson Court, c.1890 Kelly's Directory of 1901 lists the Parish Clerk as one William Roberts and sub-postmaster as one Richard Keyte. Two private dwellings are listed for a Mr. St. John Knox Richards Phillips J.P. at Whitson Court and for Reverend John Price of St.Bees (vicar of Whitson & Goldcliff) at the Vicarage. Commercial residents are listed as: *Henry Gale, farmer, Church Farm; *John Hale, farmer, Whitson Farm; *Mrs Charlotte Howells, farmer, Whitson Green; *Thomas James, Newhouse; *Edward Jones, stonemason; *Robert Roberts, farmer; *John Keyte, farmer, Chestnut Tree Farm; *Richard Keyte, carpenter, wheelwright & post office; *Edgar Morgan, farmer, Court Farm; *John Waters, farmer, Green Court; *Charles Webb, farmer. Eve, daughter of one time postmaster Mr Roberts, is alleged to have died at The Farmer's Arms in Goldcliff and caused a haunting of the property. When a religious ceremony of exorcism was performed, Eve's ghost appeared and was chased northwards by the villagers, towards the town, where she flung herself into a well. The well became known as \\"Ffynnon Eva\\" or Eve's Well - in the Newport district in Beechwood now known as Eveswell.Goldcliff & Whitson at visitoruk.com From: The Gwent Village Book, Gwent Federation of Women's Institutes, published by Countryside Books. Architecture =The Church= St. Mary's Church in 2009 The tiny parish church, with its distinctive \\"thimble tower,\\" is situated to the east of the village at Porton. It is a Grade II* listed building and is thought to have originally been a chapellage of the Benedictine Priory at Goldcliff. Although the original dedication is unclear, the church is known locally as St. Mary's (not to be confused with the church of St. Mary Magdelene at Goldcliff). An ancient building of stone, in the Early English style, it consists of chancel, nave, south porch and a western tower, originally containing two bells. The inscription for the larger bell was \\"God save our King and Kingdom, and send us peace. W. and E. 1758\\" and for the smaller bell of the same date \\"Obedite\\".Hando, F.J., (1958) \\"Out and About in Monmouthshire\\", R. H. Johns, Newport. Prior to the 20th century the nave was restored and the chancel substantially rebuilt. There is a Norman font and a stained glass memorial east window erected in 1884 by the family of Reverend John Beynon. In 1901 there were 100 sittings. The register of baptisms dates from 1744, marriages from 1729 and burials from 1728. In 1901 the living was a vicarage with a net income of ¬£196, including of glebe and residence, in the gift of Eton College and the Dean and Chapter of Llandaff alternately, and held from 1900 by the Reverend John Price. Bradney (1933) notes the church as \\"remarkable for its fine tower with a pinnacle at one corner.\\"Bradney, Sir Joseph. A History of Monmouthshire, Vol 4 Part 2: The Hundred of Caldicot (Part 2), published 1933, reprinted 1994, Merton Priory Press. The church is now closed, is in a very poor state of repair, and has been placed on the council‚Äôs register for Buildings at Risk. The churchyard, which is well maintained, may still be accessed by means of a public footpath through private land. In November 2018 it was revealed that plans to convert the church to a private residence were likely to be rejected because of flood risk. Concerns were also raised over a stained glass window, dedicated to the memory of Herbert and Alice Stevens, paid for by their 14 children.https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/17267847.plans-to-convert- whitson-medieval-church-into-home-could-be-rejected-by-newport-city-council- over-flooding-concerns/ =Whitson Court= Whitson Court, c.1890 Whitson Court is a neo-classical house. Built in the grounds of a medieval tithe barn linked to Goldcliff Priory and on the site of an earlier house, the present property was built for William Phillips (1752-1836), High Sheriff for Monmouthshire, in about 1791 and is a Grade II* listed building, retaining many original features. Originally believed to have been designed by Anthony Keck, who had designed a similar property at Iscoed in Carmarthenshire, Whitson House had many Nash-inspired additions including the unsupported cantilever stone spiral staircase in the hall, similar to that of Ffynone Mansion at Manordeifi in Pembrokeshire, with an arched door frame underneath and plasterwork known to have been used at other Nash houses. There were also false plaster windows added to the ends of the adjoining pavilions which were typical of John Nash. In the same year (1791), Nash was working on his design for Newport Bridge and the lodge at Whitson Court is of a typical Nash design. Monumental inscriptions at Whitson Church indicate that the house was called Whitson House from at least 1789 and for most of the 19th century, but had become Whitson Court by 1903. Memorial stones for the Phillips family may also be found in St. Mary's church in the neighbouring village of Nash. (William Phillips also built Redbrick House in nearby Redwick). After the death of St. John Knox Rickards Phillips, in 1901 ownership of the house passed to a distant relative, Fr Oliver Rodie Vassall-Phillips CSsR. In consequence of the persecution of religious congregations in France, the Sacramentines of Bernay of the Perpetual Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament at the time of the expulsion in July 1903, were compelled to close their boarding-school and go into exile. Thirteen of the sisters retired to Belgium, and founded a house at Hal, while the rest of their community settled at Whitson Court - thanks to the generosity of Reverend Vassall-Phillips, who wrote: \\"This order of nuns existence is precarious, for they are not permitted to open a school. Their days are spent in prayer, adoration, and the making of altar-breads, vestments, and church ornaments.\\" In 1910 the left pavilion wing, which was used as the estate laundry, was partially destroyed by fire. A meeting of the Monmouthshire Bee Keepers Association, Whitson Court, c.1941 In March 1911, the Sacramentines were permitted by Archbishop Farley to open a house in Holy Trinity parish, Yonkers, New York and the house and estate at Whitson were then used as a training school for their African missions. In 1917, the Whitson Estate, encompassing most of the local farms and totalling some and the Manorial Title, were sold at auction mainly to its existing tenant farmers. When Bradney published his \\"History of Monmouthshire\\" in 1932, the house stood empty. In 1933 Whitson Court and its remaining of gardens and parkland, were purchased from the then owner, Squire Oakley, by Mr Garroway Smith of \\"The Chalet\\" at Ridgeway in Newport who took up residence at the property with his wife Mary and his sister Louise. Mr William Maybury, his wife Olive Maybury and their daughters, Jane and Elizabeth also moved into the house. Their third daughter, Mary, was born at Whitson Court in May 1938. During World War II, the family gave sanctuary to several German Jewish refugees as well as providing work for German Prisoners of War - many of the paths in the grounds were built by German POW Officers housed at the Prisoner of War camp in Nash. Ironically the house was also used as a reference point by German bomber crews, aiming their runs at Newport Docks. Whitson Court in July 2015 Following the death of Garroway Smith in the late 1950s, the house and grounds passed to his niece, Olive Maybury who made various alterations to the house, adding three neo-classical plaster relief panels to the fire surround in the morning room, an ornately carved fire surround in the former kitchen and the replacement of the dilapidated spiral staircase to the top floor of the house, with a Gothic secondary staircase, removed from Plas LLecha at Tredunnock. The family collected exotic animals including Bornean Sun Bears, Himalayan Bears, lions and a large collection of monkeys, reptiles and exotic birds. The family opened the grounds to the public during the 1960s and 1970s and they were a popular attraction for local families and school children. In 1980 Whitson Zoo was closed and many of the animals were re- homed. Olive Maybury continued to live at Whitson Court until her death in 1998 at the age of 99. The house and grounds were subsequently sold by the family and was again left empty, listed on Newport Council's \\"Buildings at Risk\\" register. It was sold once again in 2008 and has now been fully restored by its current owners under the guidance of Cadw.http://documents.newport.gov.uk/NorthgatePublicDocs/05007135.pdf =Whitehall Farm/Redbrick House= This property is situated in the neighbouring parish of Redwick. The earliest church records show that there has been a house on the site since 1450, then called Whitehall Farm. The main Georgian fa√ßade was built in about 1795, by William Phillips, owner of Whiston Court. Phillips built the Brick House in anticipation of his son William's return to Britain from the American Colonies. William junior sadly never returned, however, as the ship bringing him home was wrecked in a storm and William drowned.Brick House Country Guest House history The house is now a guest house.  Amenities  The village hall, now unused, was for many years the site of an annual village fair at Whitsuntide which traditionally included a road-race run around the three parishes - a distance of about . The village was the home for the Post Office for the three parishes for many years but this has now long since closed. The village has never been known to have had its own public house. There is a large electricity sub-station, operated by the National Grid, adjacent to the former site of Llanwern steelworks near Whitson Arch. The local newspaper is the South Wales Argus which is published in Newport. Since Match 2015 the village has used a Demand Responsive Transport public bus service (Route 63, two a day, weekdays) provided by Newport Bus. =Upfield Farm Aerodrome= Since 1995 a light aircraft landing strip (council approved for use as a grass strip for the owner, family and friends) was used by Mr Ken Bowen at his Upfield Farm home. By 2008 the strip had become a -long concrete airstrip, a series of aircraft hangars and a perimeter hard standing. On 4 July 2008 a light aircraft crash-landed after taking off from the airstrip. Narrowly missing both the old Village Hall and a nearby stables, the aircraft burst into flames and was almost completely destroyed. Emergency services attended but both occupants escaped unharmed. The resultant accident inquiry by Newport City Council and the Civil Aviation Authority found that the airstrip at the farm had grown considerably beyond the scope of its original approved planning permission, and was, according to some local residents, supporting as many as ten flights a day. Mr Bowen applied for retrospective planning permission to retain the facility with its concrete runway, but was denied by the council planning committee on 17 September 2008 acting on advice from the planning department. The owner did not attend the meeting but was given to appeal the decision within six months. In November 2009 an appeal was dismissed.  Government  The area is governed by the Newport City Council and the Goldcliff community council. The village falls within the Llanwern ward of the Newport East parliamentary constituency.

It is within the historic county of Monmouthshire. Etymology The name translates from the Welsh as a \\"bare hill\\" or \\"mound\\". Archaeology Willcrick is located on the B4245 road to the northwest of Magor. To the southeast of the village is Wilcrick Hill which has a hillfort on its summit, of which only the earthworks remain. Archaeological evidence, in the form of a small Iron Age settlement found preserved under peat at Barland's Farm, suggests that the occupiers probably moved inland, from the lower lying and wetter Caldicot Level, with their grazing cattle, when water-levels rose in the autumn, possibly to the hillfort which overlooks the site. Nearby, a nearly complete 3rd century Romano-British oak boat was found beside a buried stone and timber quay in 1993, during the building of a distribution depot at the nearby Europark. This suggests that much higher water levels prevailed on the Levels at the time. The church The parish church is dedicated to St. Mary, with the minister historically being also the minister for Llanmartin. The only ministers not appearing also as ministers there were Peter Ameline, rector of Wilcrick in 1535 and Edmond Jones instituted to Wilcrick on 16 July 1631. After that the names and dates of ministers for both parishes are the same. The church has a bell of 1726 cast by the Evans foundry of Chepstow. Historian J.A.

It includes behaviours and communication that theorists consider to be manipulative or violent, such as corporal punishment.  Origin and definitions The concept was first introduced by Katharina Rutschky in her 1977 work Schwarze P√§dagogik. Quellen zur Naturgeschichte der b√ºrgerlichen Erziehung. The psychologist Alice Miller used the concept to describe child- raising approaches that, she believed, damage a child's emotional development. Miller claims that this alleged emotional damage promotes adult behavior harmful to individuals. She explains how poisonous pedagogy in the name of \\"child rearing\\" leads to dysfunctions and neurosis of all kinds. For instance in her book For Your Own Good she discussed its common impact on three distinct lives: Adolf Hitler, J√ºrgen Bartsch and Christiane F., whereas in The Body Never Lies, she talks about the impact of childhood trauma and repressed emotions on the human body. \\"Poisonous pedagogy\\" is described by these theorists as what happens when a parent (or teacher, nurse, or other caregiver) believes that a young child's behavior demonstrates that the child is infected with the \\"seeds of evil\\", and therefore attempts to weed out the evil, either by emotional manipulation or by brute force. Simple examples include the beating of children as punishment for lying, or mothers who refuse to feed their newborn until a set time, in order to \\"teach him patience, which will be useful for him in later life\\". Poisonous pedagogy, in Katharina Rutschky's definition, aims to inculcate a social superego in the child, to construct a basic defense against drives in the child's psyche, to toughen the child for later life, and to instrumentalize the body parts and senses in favor of socially defined functions. Although not explicitly, \\"poisonous pedagogy\\" serves, these theorists allege, as a rationalization of sadism and a defense against the feelings of the parent himself or of the person involved. For methods, Rutschky claims, \\"poisonous pedagogy\\" makes use of initiation rites (for example, internalizing a threat of death), the application of pain (including psychological), the totalitarian supervision of the child (body control, behavior, obedience, prohibition of lying, etc.), taboos against touching, the denial of basic needs, and an extreme desire for order.  Historical background  = Ancient cultures = The Roman poets Plautus, Horace, Martial, and Juvenal described corporal punishments in schools. It is also written in the Bible, Proverbs 13:24. \\"He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.\\" Corporal punishment was widespread in all of these civilizations. The expression \\"Spare the rod and spoil the child\\" derives from the Bible, Proverbs, 13:24, and was adapted by Samuel Butler in the satirical poem Hudibras. =Germany= In the 18th century common notions of the evil nature of children or of taming bear witness to superstitions and the wish to be able to train human beings like animals. One German child-raising book in the 18th century said: \\"These first years have, among other things, the advantage that one can use force and compulsion. With age children forget everything they encountered in their early childhood. Thus if one can take away children's will, they will not remember afterward that they had had a will.\\"Sulzer, J. Versuch von der Erziehung und Unterweisung der Kinder, 1748. In Germany the parental right to discipline was abolished by a change in the law in 2000. The Federal Minister for Family Affairs from 1994 to 1998 Claudia Nolte had wanted to maintain parents' right to use mild spanking,\\"Zur Bundestagswahl: Parteien im Vergleich\\" (in German), analysis of the views of German political parties. contrary to the views of Alice Miller in her 1980 book For Your Own Good. Miller has written: \\"I understand 'black pedagogy' to be a parenting approach that is directed toward breaking the will of the child, in order to make it an obedient subject, with the aid of open or concealed use of force, manipulation, and repression.\\"Miller, A. Evas Erwachen.  Psychological background  A relevant criterion in defining poisonous pedagogy is if a manipulative approach reveals behavioural issues in the parent such as a blindness to feelings, cruelty, or a tendency toward violence, or if strong negative emotions such as anger or hate are being discharged, emotions against which the juvenile or infant psyche, with its age-based limitations, cannot defend itself. Miller also came to the conclusion, as a result of her therapeutic work, that she needed to \\"work on\\" her own childhood in order to understand her clients better. She takes the view that \\"poisonous pedagogy\\" is a behavior that is passed on from generation to generation by being euphemized and sanitized. Other themes of the controversial author Katharina Rutschky are parenting, feminist criticism, and abuse.  Personalities  Influential advocates of various forms of corporal punishment include John Harvey Kellogg, Moritz Schreber, and others.  Discussion and criticism  Alice Miller defines poisonous pedagogy as all types of behavior that she believes is intended to manipulate children's characters through force or deception. Her focus is not merely on smacking (although she has said that \\"Every smack is a humiliation\\" and clearly opposes corporal punishment) but also on various other forms of manipulation, deceit, hypocrisy, and coercion, which she argues are commonly used by parents and teachers against children. Sociology professor Frank Furedi believes that such declarations are too sweeping and disconnected from reality. Furedi labels many advocates of a total ban on physical punishment as being against all forms of punishing children. He sees the underlying agenda as an anti-parent crusade, and argues that some research on the effects of spanking is far less clear-cut than the claims made on its behalf by what he calls \\"anti-smacking zealots\\". Social psychologist David Smail contends that society bears a large part of the responsibility for individuals' dysfunctional behavior, but as yet has not addressed this in any meaningful way. Developmental psychologist James W. Prescott, in the 1970s, carried out research into primate child-mother bonding and noted a link between disruption to the child-mother bonding process and the emergence of violence and fear based behaviour in the young primates. He suggests that the same dynamic functions for human beings, through the breakdown of empathy. In 1975, Prescott outlined a link between violence and disruption of the child- mother bonding process in human societies, drawing on a cross-cultural study of Aboriginal societies and a statistical analysis of those cultures' practices towards the nurturing of the natural child-mother bonding process, and an examination of historical attitudes towards children from Euramerican literature and the historical record. He concluded that the disrupted child- mother bonding process was an absolute predictor of the emergence of violence, hierarchy, rigid gender roles, a dominatory psychology and violent territorial acquisition. Intervening upon and disrupting natural adolescent sexuality also formed part of the overall picture. This discovery was not expected. Most societies were peaceful, and the incidence of extremely violent societies was low. Prescott states that the research showed that over time, disruptive practices become the 'norm' and as generations grow and pass on these practices, the society in question begins to demonstrate a clear lack of empathy, and violence is codified. The history of poisonous pedagogy, in his view, is the history of this codification of these non-nurturant practices. It is upon these that current transmitted practice is found. Recent research into living Aboriginal societies and a review of the historical record of first contact data, and other recorded observations, over the past 400 years have shown that the majority of Aboriginal cultures do not chastise children. The data show that children are treated with much more respect, trust and empathy than was previously believed.

It is properly a secondary summit of High Raise, but is given a separate chapter by Alfred Wainwright in his third Pictorial Guide nonetheless, as it \\"is so prominent an object and offers so compelling a challenge\\". Its rocky cone is indeed in great contrast to the grassy dome of High Raise. Topography Sergeant Man lies a third of a mile to the south east of the parent fell and is the pivotal point for a complex system of ridges radiating eastward from High Raise. Sergeant Man is not actually visible from the peak of High Raise and Sergeant Man only comes into view as you gently descend from High Raise. South east, passing between Codale and Stickle Tarns is the broad spur leading to Blea Rigg, Silver How and Loughrigg. Sitting above Codale Tarn is the rocky subsidiary top of Codale Head ‚Äî a grandchild of High Raise. From here further ridges run east to Tarn Crag and north east to Calf Crag and the circuit of Greenburn. Steep ground falls away to the south of Sergeant Man, down to the valley of Bright Beck, this being the main feeder of Stickle Tarn. All water from this flank flows to Great Langdale. East of the summit between the Tarn Crag and Blea Rigg ridges, lie Codale Tarn and the headwaters of Easedale, streams bound for Grasmere. To the north of Sergeant Man are the upper gathering grounds of Wythburndale, which flow via Thirlmere to the sea at Workington. Ascents The popular ways up Sergeant Man are either from Great Langdale via Stickle Tarn, or by a variety of routes from Grasmere village. These can take in the Blea Rigg, Tarn Crag or Calf Crag ridges, or ascend via Far Easedale or Easedale Tarn. The latter route takes the walker past Belles Knott, a striking feature near Codale Tarn. From below it appears as a sharp peak, etched against the skyline, but from above an easy grassy promenade is revealed behind.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): Summit The area between Sergeant Man and Codale Head has a rash of small tarns, but the summit area is otherwise reasonably dry. The final cone is most easily climbed via a ridge on the northern side, and has good all round views except where obscured by High Raise.

Rose Floyd D. Rose (born 1948https://floydrose.com/pages/about-us) is an American musician and engineer who invented the Floyd Rose Locking Tremolo System in the late 1970s, eventually founding a company of the same name to manufacture and license his products. This double locking system was notable for its ability to stay in tune despite repeated use and wide variations in pitch. His design was later recognized on Guitar Worlds \\"10 Most Earth Shaking Guitar Innovations.\\" Development of the locking system Rose was a guitarist in a rock band in the 1970s. Like many other guitarists of the time period, he frequently experienced issues with his guitars going out of tune after using the tremolo arm. In 1976, after trying several traditional techniques for keeping the guitar in tune, he began developing a locking system to keep the strings from moving freely through the nut. Several improvements soon followed, including using more durable materials to lock the strings down on the nut, and the creation of a similar system of clamps to lock the strings down on the bridge. His double locking system was originally hand-made, but high demand eventually led to Rose licensing his design to Kramer Guitars for large-scale manufacturing.  Musical career  In the early 1980s, Rose was playing guitar in an American hard rock band named C.O.R.E. Eventually, he and vocalist Scott Palmerton (also known as Jonathan K.) left the band in order to form Q5. They were joined by guitarist Rick Pierce, bassist Evan Sheeley and drummer Gary Thompson from another local band named TKO. In 1983, the band gained the attention of the rock band Heart's management team and recorded a seven-song demo. Later that same year, the band recorded their debut album, Steel the Light, and was re-released the following year on the Music for Nations label. The band's follow-up album, When the Mirror Cracks, took a more commercial approach, but failed to achieve the level of success of their previous release. The band disbanded shortly after.

Created by Tetsu Kariya, the show was produced by Toho Company Ltd., and aired on Fuji TV from May 7 to December 24, 1979, with a total of 31 half-hour episodes. Starting with Episode 14, the show's title became Flaming Superman Megaloman (ÁÇé„ÅÆË∂Ö‰∫∫„É°„Ç¨„É≠„Éû„É≥ - Hon√¥ no Ch√¥jin Megaroman). Like Toho's Meteor Man Zone, the series mixes elements of the Kyodai Hero genre with those of the Sentai Series (Battle Fever J, the first \\"Super Sentai\\", had premiered on TV around the same time). This series features a superhero quintet similar to those seen in the Super Sentai Series, but just like in Zone Fighter, the team's leader/main character Takashi Shishidou transforms into a giant long- haired Ultraman-like colossus, Megaloman. The Story The planet Rosetta has been taken over by the Black Star army led by Captain Dagger. Takashi Shishido and his mother Rosemary escaped to Planet Earth after his father Gou was captured by Dagger, who is actually Takashi's evil twin brother Hiroshi! While living peacefully on Earth, Takashi attends a kung-fu school in Japan, and has four friends, but they had no idea that he was from another planet, a secret only his martial arts teacher Takamine knew. But when Captain Dagger initiates his attack on Earth using his army of various giant monsters, Rosemary (who also goes by the civilian name \\"Mari\\") gives Takashi the Megalon-Bracelets, with which he can transform into the giant long-haired warrior Megaloman to fight the evil monsters for the protection of Earth. Early in the show, Takashi's four martial arts school friends, Seiji Kurogawa (a tough, Bruce Lee-like fighter), Hyosuke Yuri (the comedy relief), Ran Takamine (Master Takamine's daughter & Takashi's girlfriend) and Ippei Saru (the little kid) discover his secret and Rosemary decides to invite them to join Takashi in battle. So she gives them their own Megalon Bracelets to transform into a quartet of multicolored martial arts super-warriors to fight alongside Takashi.

The Sala del Tricolore (Italian for \\"Room of the Tricolor\\") is an historical hall, currently the council chamber of the comune of Reggio Emilia, northern Italy. Designed by the architect Lodovico Bolognini, as the archive of the ducal family of Este, it is mostly known in connection with the birth of the flag of Italy (also known as \\"the tricolor\\"), from which it takes its name. Description The palace of town hall of Reggio Emilia Sala del Tricolore: detail of the municipal council chairs =The palace= The Sala del Tricolore is located within the town hall of Reggio Emilia. The palace was built from 1414 to 1417. It began to be used as a meeting room of the municipal council of Reggio Emilia in 1434. It was enlarged in 1461 with the construction of the wing towards the modern via Farini and via Croce Bianca: this portion of the building also had an external loggia. In the following years the building was enlarged again. In 1583 Prospero Pacchioni designed and carried out his complete renovation. The building's facade was built in 1774 to a design by Ludovico Bolognini. =The Sala del Tricolore= The room looks like an elliptical room, surrounded by three rows of balconies. There is a large chandelier that illuminates a neoclassical architectural style environment; the latter is characterized by columns with Corinthian capitals on top. The hall has the function of council chamber of the municipality of Reggio Emilia: therefore it is used for meetings of the municipal council of the city. It also houses the civic gonfalone of the municipality of Reggio Emilia. It is also used for cultural events, conferences and weddings, as well as for the annual commemorative ceremony for the anniversary of the birth of the Italian national flag, which takes place every January 7 on the occasion of the Tricolour Day, in the presence of the highest offices of the Italian Republic. On March 16, 2015 the \\"Sala del Tricolore\\" hosted an important young political event for Emilia- Romagna and the city: the opening ceremony of the XV Regional Session of the Model European Parliament, hosting delegations from the host city, Ferrara, Mirandola, Modena, Carpi, Cento and Prato; the mayor Luca Vecchi, the MEP president Andrea Russo and other authorities opened the session to a full Sala del Tricolore. History =The origins of the Sala del Tricolore = The origins of this salon date back to 1768, when the Duke of Modena and Reggio Francesco III d'Este decided to have a central state archive built that should have kept all the documents of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. The architect's choice to entrust the drafting of the project and the construction of the new hall fell on Lodovico Bolognini, who then carried out the work from 1772 to 1785. During the construction works Giovanni Benassi, court carpenter, always under the supervision of Bolognini, built from 1773 to 1774 a wooden model of the hall which lacked, compared to the modern version, the balconies: in their place were provided shelving for the preservation of documents, which were accessed via wooden ramparts. Shortly after the end of the works it was decided not to use it as a file: the large quantity of documents contained in it could have caused a vast fire, with all the consequences of the case. To decide the intended use of the hall, the ducal archive was rejected, a commission was established. This consultation proposed, among other things, its splitting up into several rooms to be used as offices but the duke opposed him postponing his decision. =The birth of the flag of Italy= Giuseppe Compagnoni, the \\"father of the tricolor\\" The commemorative plaque placed in the atrium of the town hall of Reggio Emilia on the occasion of the centenary of the flag of Italy With the invasion of Napoleon's troops the duke fled and the Reggian Republic was proclaimed (26 August 1796). At the same time the Civic Guard of the city of Reggio was constituted: this military formation, aided by a small group of French grenadiers, defeated, on 4 October 1796, a squad of 150 Austrian soldiers at Montechiarugolo, a municipality in the modern province of Parma. The victory was so important - both from a political and symbolic point of view - that Napoleon Bonaparte made an official commendation to the Reggio soldiers who were the protagonists of the battle. For the armed clash of Montechiarugolo Napoleon Bonaparte defined the city of Reggio Emilia as \\"the most mature Italian city for freedom\\". Moreover, in Reggio Emilia, in August 1796, one of the first liberty pole had been planted. This events, which arose from a revolt against the ducal government on August 20, 1796 in Reggio, contributed, together with the events linked to the battle of Montechiarugolo, to the decision to choose Reggio Emilia as the venue for the congress cispadano, assembly that then led to the birth of the flag of Italy. As a symbolic recognition of the Montechiarugolo clash, and for the aforementioned event related to the tree of liberty, Napoleon suggested to the deputies of the Cispadan cities (Reggio, Modena, Bologna and Ferrara) to gather their first congress - which should have taken place on 27 December 1796 - in Reggio Emilia. The proposal was followed despite heated controversy with the other cities of Emilia, which wanted the assembly organized in their own municipality; the congress of December 27 took place then in the hall of the Reggio town hall designed by Bolognini which was to house the archive of the former duchy. Here, 110 delegates chaired by Carlo Facci approved the constitutional charter of the Cispadane Republic, including the territories of Bologna, Ferrara, Modena and Reggio Emilia. For this reason the salon of the Bolognini was renamed \\"centumvirate congress hall\\" or \\"patriotic hall\\". The flag of the Cispadane Republic In subsequent meetings, which always took place in the \\"hall of the congress centumvirate\\" of Reggio, many decisions were decreed and formalized, including the choice of the emblem of the newly formed republic. To put forward the proposal for the adoption of a green, white and red national flag was Giuseppe Compagnoni - who for this reason is remembered as the \\"father of the tricolor\\" - in the XIV session of the congress cispadano of 7 January 1797. The adoption decree states: The final choice of a green, white and red flag was not without a prior discussion: instead of the green the Italian Jacobins would have favored the blue of the French flag, while the members of the papacy would have preferred the yellow of the Papal States' banner: on the white and the red there were no disputes. Finally, the discussion on the third color focused on green, which was later approved as a compromise solution. The choice of greenery was most probably inspired by the tricolor green, white and red military flag of the Lombard Legion, the first Italian military department to equip itself, as a banner, with an Italian tricolor flag. The congress's decision to adopt a green, white and red tricolor flag was then also greeted by a jubilant atmosphere, so much was the enthusiasm of the delegates, and by bursts of applause. For the first time, the city of ducal states for centuries enemies, they identify themselves as one people and a common identity symbol: the tricolor flag. For the first time the Italian flag officially became the national flag of a sovereign state, disengaging itself from the local military and civic meaning: with this adoption the Italian flag therefore assumed an important political value. On the basis of this event, the \\"centumvirate congress hall\\" of Reggio was later renamed \\"Sala del Tricolore\\". In the assembly of 21 January, which was instead convened in Modena, the adoption of the Tricolor was confirmed. The flag of the Cispadane Republic was in horizontal bands with the top red, the white in the center and the green at the bottom. In the center was also the emblem of the republic, while on the sides the letters \\"R\\" and \\"C\\" were shown, the initials of the two words that form the name of the \\"Repubblica Cispadana\\".

G. Wodehouse. Pyke is a publishing magnate, the founder and owner of the Mammoth Publishing Company. Outside his business, he has a passion for pigs and is the owner of a prize pig named Buckingham Big Boy. Pyke appears in several novels, including two set at Blandings Castle: Heavy Weather (1933) and Service With a Smile (1961). Inspiration According to Robert McCrum, Wodehouse knew the British publishing magnate Lord Northcliffe, who served as a source of inspiration for Lord Tilbury. Life Wodehouse introduces Pyke in Bill the Conqueror as plain Sir George Pyke. Mammoth Publishing Company is already a mighty undertaking and Pyke is about to become a Lord ‚Äì he selects the Tilbury title based on the address of his headquarters, at Tilbury House on Tilbury Street. Pyke is not a tall man and runs somewhat to fat. His similarity to Napoleon, both in physique and character, is often remarked upon. He is a widower, his late wife Lucy having left him a son named Roderick. He also has a sister named Francie, who is married to an archaeologist, and he had an elder brother, Edmund Pyke. After school, where he knew both Lord Emsworth and his brother Galahad Threepwood and was given the nickname Stinker, he became a clerk in a solicitor's office, but soon broke into the media, founding his first magazine, Pyke's Weekly. With the success of this paper, thanks in no small part to the advice of his sister, Pyke's empire began to grow, accumulating such titles as Society Spice and Home Gossip. Pyke's right-hand man at the Mammoth is Percy Pilbeam, an efficient young man who becomes editor of Society Spice when Pyke's son runs off, and later heads up a detective agency. Stories George Pyke appears in the following books: * Bill the Conqueror (1924) ‚Äì in which much of his family appear, and he becomes a Lord * Sam the Sudden (1925) ‚Äì (U.S. title: Sam in the Suburbs) * Summer Lightning (1929) ‚Äì in which he only appears off-stage, acting through Pilbeam (U.S. title: Fish Preferred) * Heavy Weather (1933) ‚Äì in which he must himself come to Blandings Castle * Service With a Smile (1961) ‚Äì in which he comes up against Uncle Fred * Frozen Assets (1964) ‚Äì in which he finally falls in love (U.S. title: Biffen's Millions) The Mammoth Publishing Company crops up in many other stories, for example providing employment for Ashe Marson and Joan Valentine in Something Fresh. Adaptations Norman Shelley portrayed Lord Tilbury in the 1938 radio adaptation of Sam the Sudden, which was titled Semi-Detached. Lord Tilbury was voiced by John Savident in the Blandings radio series adaptation of Heavy Weather in 1988. He was portrayed by Richard Johnson in the 1995 television film Heavy Weather.

Malcolm Holmes had played drums with OMD before, notably on \\"Julia's Song\\" which was featured on the band's debut album, and for Organisation he was recruited as a full-time member replacing the TEAC tape recorder affectionately named \\"Winston\\". \\"The More I See You\\" is a cover of a song written by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren in 1945, and popularised by Chris Montez in 1966. The record was remastered and re-released in 2003, with several bonus tracks. Organisation has received generally favourable reviews. Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson has hailed the record as the finest of OMD's career. Album information As with all OMD's early sleeve art, it was created by Peter Saville Associates and features a photograph by Richard Nutt of the cloud-covered peak of Marsco, in the Red Cuillin hills, overlooking Glen Sligachan on the Isle of Skye with Allt Dearg M√≤r in the foreground. The album's title refers to the band Organisation, a precursor to Kraftwerk. The album is notable for its melancholy tone. The band said that at the time they had been heavily influenced by Joy Division; this can be seen by the use of jarring drum sounds and moody songs on Organisation. Also notable is OMD's move away from pure Gary Numan-Kraftwerk-ian pop, embracing a grander sound, making an increasing use of acoustic instruments, and introducing sound collages. The group would continue to expand their sound this way on the next two albums Architecture & Morality and Dazzle Ships. The single \\"Enola Gay\\" had little in common with the style of the rest of the album, despite its dark subject matter. Andy McCluskey has said it was written at the same time as the group's debut album. \\"Motion and Heart\\" was also considered for a single release, but was dropped. A new recording of the song was made; this was released as a B-side of Architecture & Morality‚Äôs \\"Souvenir\\" and can be found on the remastered edition of that album. \\"VCL XI\\" was the name of Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys' short lived group, which itself was named after a valve on the back of Kraftwerk's Radio-Activity album (although the name of the valve is actually written \\"VCL 11\\" on the Kraftwerk album). \\"Stanlow\\" was written about the Stanlow Refinery in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.

OMD are warmer than your so-called \\"warm\\" bands, your [Bruce] Springsteens, your [Graham] Parkers could ever be. They reflect the young horror of where and how we live but... they face the problems with an irrepressible intuitive sense that makes the best pop of any time.\\" In his review for Melody Maker, Lynden Barber said: \\"With their second album, OMD have produced not so much a collection of songs as a pervading mood, a feeling of restlessness spiked by an unsettling edge that never allows the music to descend into complacency... the music here represents a very healthy step forward.\\" The album has received positive retrospective appraisals. In his review for AllMusic, Ned Raggett opined: \\"If OMD's debut album showed the band could succeed just as well on full-length efforts as singles, Organisation upped the ante even further, situating the band in the enviable position of at once being creative innovators and radio-friendly pop giants. That was shown as much by the astounding lead track and sole single from the album, \\"Enola Gay\\"... Organisation is packed with a number of gems, showing the band's reach and ability continuing to increase.\\" Raggett's colleague Dave Thompson praised the group's \\"inspired\\" cover of \\"The More I See You\\", asserting that OMD \\"totally reinvented the number, bringing a startling new reading to the song.\\"Thompson, Dave.

He is one of the members of the Roux family, and son of Michel Roux. Career Roux first decided to be a chef at the age of 14, something which his chef father, Michel Roux described as being equally \\"over the moon\\" and \\"disturbed\\" about. Alain spent eight years in France training at various restaurants. He was sent first to the P√¢tisserie Millet in Paris in 1984 to undergo an apprenticeship as a pastry chef. He stayed there until 1986 when the apprenticeship was completed, and he moved around a number of different Michelin starred restaurants for the rest of his time in France, including three starred Restaurant Pic, Le Domaine d'Orvault, La Bonne Etape, Ch√¢teau de Montreuil and La C√¥te Saint-Jacques. Whilst in France, he served his period of military conscription as a chef at the √âlys√©e Palace. Roux moved back to his family's Waterside Inn in Bray, Berkshire, at the age of 23 in 1992 where he became a demi-chef de partie. In 1995, he became sous chef and he took over from his father as chef-patron of the Waterside Inn in 2002. Before this, in 2000, he joined Relais Desserts, an international society of pastry chefs. Roux was chef-patron in 2010 when the Waterside Inn celebrated becoming the first restaurant outside France to hold three Michelin stars for 25 years. Alain is one of the judges of the Roux Scholarship, and has appeared as a celebrity chef judge on MasterChef: The Professionals. In 2011, he developed new menus for the Business Premier class onboard Eurostar trains. Personal life Alain is a member of the Roux family.

It is currently run by Michel's son, Alain. The restaurant has three Michelin stars, and in 2010 it became the first restaurant outside France to retain all three stars for twenty-five years. Description The Waterside Inn opened in 1972, following the Roux brothers' success at Le Gavroche. Pierre Koffmann was made the first head chef, having worked for Michel and Albert Roux at Le Gavroche. Koffmann remained as head chef until 1977 when he left to open his own restaurant, La Tante Claire. Michel Roux took over as head chef at the restaurant, slowly handing the reins over during the 2010s to his son and the current chef-patron, Alain Roux. Michel spoke of the handover, \\"The Waterside Inn has been my life but now my son runs it. What could be better? I am very proud of him. After all his name is above the door.\\" Alain has added his own menu items to the restaurant while keeping Roux family classics like souffl√© suissesse and tron√ßonnette de homard. Diego Masciaga has been the restaurant manager since 1988, and speaks of the two chefs highly, \\"Mr Michel was always there in the kitchen ‚Äì morning, afternoon, night ‚Äì with his big voice. Now it is the turn of Alain. Alain is a great man, too, but in his own way.\\" In addition to being a restaurant, the Waterside Inn has been slowly expanding the number of rooms available for overnight stays since 1992. The interiors were designed individually in a French style by Michel Roux's wife, Robyn. In 2010, the Waterside Inn became the only restaurant outside France to retain three Michelin stars for 25 years. To celebrate, a party was held for which every Michelin starred chef in the UK was invited; 116 chefs attended. In addition, an offer was extended to local residents for lunch at 1985 prices, at a cost of ¬£14.50 each instead of the normal ¬£56. Reception Matthew Fort reviewed The Waterside Inn for The Guardian in 2002, giving the restaurant a rating of eighteen out of twenty, and stated that the price of the meal was \\"money very well spent\\". Max Davidson, in the same year, described the food as \\"Nothing flash, just mouthful after mouthful of pure quality,\\" while writing for the Daily Mail, giving the restaurant three stars. Matthew Norman, reviewing the Waterside Inn for The Daily Telegraph in 2010, praised the setting and the attentive service but criticised the value for money of the food served; he gave it a total of six out of ten, but described the cheese trolley as \\"spectacular\\". Also in 2010, John Walsh for The Independent visited the Waterside Inn shortly after it celebrated 25 years with a Michelin star. While he also criticised the cost of some of the courses, saying \\"I knew it was expensive. Everybody knows that,\\" he celebrated the quality of the food, describing his main course as \\"ambrosial\\" and \\"fabulous\\". He gave the restaurant four out of five each for food and ambiance, and five out of five for service. The Waterside Inn placed eighteenth in The Good Food Guides top 60 restaurants in the UK for 2011. Heston Blumenthal's nearby Bray based restaurant The Fat Duck placed first, while Le Gavroche placed fifteenth. The Waterside Inn was placed first for both food and service in the Zagat survey on restaurants in London and Southeast England.

Location Kemeys Commander, north-west of Usk, comprises a few farms and cottages slightly off the main road leading to Abergavenny within a graceful bend of the River Usk. The village has the parish church of All Saints.= Origin of the name Its unusual name is derived from the fact that the patronage of the church was at one time held by the Knights Templar and was a commandery or preceptory, as their houses were termed. In the 16th century their successors, the Knights Hospitaller, drew ¬£2 13s. 4d. per annum from demesne lands in this parish. There may have been a hermitage here in early days. It is, however, doubtful whether the Kemeys family ever held it and they probably took their name from another Kemeys, Kemeys Inferior, nine miles (14 km) further down the River Usk. Both of these names are from the Welsh word cemais meaning 'bend in a river', and this is an apt description of the site of this village, which stands at the centre of a long bend of consistent radius. Despite the fact that the family did not actually take their surname from here, it was \\"farmed\\" by Edward Kemeys, perhaps as chaplain of the chantry of St. Nicholas in the parish church of Usk; in 1603 it belonged to an Edward Morgan. In 1799 Archdeacon William Coxe came here during his Historical Tour in Monmouthshire (published 1801) and wrote \\"We here mounted our horses and rode through thickets across the fields to Kemeys Commander, a small village\\". Coxe also visited the nearby village of Trostrey, recording of the church that its \\"situation is extremely wild and romantic; it stands ... remote from any inhabitation, and seems rather the solitary chapel of a hermit, than the church of a cultivated district.\\" The church All Saints church The Church of All Saints is held with Bettws Newydd nearby and has some interesting features. A small low screen divides the nave from the presbytery, taking the place of the usual chancel arch as the whole building is contained under one roof; the screen is plain and not of good workmanship, the only ornamentation being slight columns with crocketed pinnacles on each side of the entry. The altar slab, apparently not pre-Reformation, is severely mounted on plain stone squares and in keeping with the austere lines of the building. There are also a modern trefoiled aumbry and a piscina in the south wall. The east window is Perpendicular and high, and on the south side of the nave is an exceedingly small window which lighted the former rood loft. The beams of the slightly flattened barrel roof and the wall-plate are of some age. The font is octagonal. The small south door has been built-in and entrance to the building is through the timbered west porch above which is a turret containing two bells, one of which is of 13th-century date but slightly smaller than those at Gwernesney. Only the steps and base remain of the churchyard cross. In the middle of the 16th Century the provision of a light in the church, probably that before the high altar, was charged upon three aces of land in the parish. Church Farmhouse in the hamlet retains many features of the Renaissance period.Evans, C.J.O., 1950 Monmouthshire, Its History and Topography Chain Bridge Chain Bridge Chain Bridge, to the north of the village, takes the B4598 Usk to Abergavenny road over the River Usk. A bridge was here as early as the 16th century, but was washed away in winter floods in 1690 and was eventually replaced, in 1730, by a solid oak structure known as Pont Kemeys. This bridge in turn was replaced, in 1829, by a chain bridge built by Brown Lenox of Pontypridd ‚Äì supported by sturdy chains, hence the name. The current bridge, which was built between 1905 and 1906 by George Palmer of Neath, is an iron arch with green-painted girders which is still referred to as Chain Bridge. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology operates a river monitoring station at Chain Bridge which measures the river's flow rate. Kemeys Folly Kemeys Folly is a former hunting lodge built in 1712 by George Kemeys and rebuilt in the early 20th century as a home for the High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. It was converted as a private home in 2005-2011 and featured on the Channel 4 programme, Grand Designs.

In 1940 it was renamed Pia»õa Adolf Hitler, but its original name was restored shortly after 23 August 1944, when Romania joined the Allies and turned against the Axis Powers. However, following the Soviet occupation of Romania, its name was changed in 1948 to Pia»õa Generalissim I. V. Stalin, lasting until the early 1960s, when Romania began to assert a more independent foreign policy vis-√†-vis the Soviet Union. A statue of Stalin stood on the square between 1951 until a summer night in 1962, when four tanks and twelve bulldozers removed it in several hours.

Although the change of leader sparked an almost instant upswing in Conservative support (which had been declining for the previous 18 months largely due to the poll tax) and ultimately saw them win the general election in April 1992, the Tories failed to take advantage of this by-election, polling at a mere 13.4% and failing to alter the political climate in a traditional Labour stronghold.

It peaked at number 27 in the UK Albums Chart. \\"Electricity\\" and \\"Red Frame/White Light\\" were released as singles; a re-recorded version of \\"Messages\\" provided OMD with their first hit in the UK, reaching number 13. The album received favourable reviews, and has been championed by musicians ZZ Top and Vince Clarke of Erasure (formerly chief songwriter of Depeche Mode and Yazoo). The album was remastered and re- released in 2003 with six bonus tracks, including the single version of \\"Messages\\". Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark is also the title of a 1981 compilation album of tracks from this release and OMD's second album, Organisation, issued only in the United States. Background Rather than hire studio time for the album, OMD members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys used their advance from Dindisc to build their own Liverpool recording studio, The Gramophone Suite. They predicted that they would be dropped by the label due to disappointing sales, but would at least own a recording studio. Still generally a duo performing alongside a TEAC 4-track tape recorder christened \\"Winston\\", OMD enlisted Martin Cooper and Malcolm Holmes, the latter of whom had performed with McCluskey and Humphreys in OMD precursor outfit The Id (both musicians would become full-time band members the following year). Cooper played saxophone on \\"Mystereality\\", while Holmes supplied percussion on \\"Julia's Song\\"; Dave Fairbairn played guitar on this track, as well as on \\"Messages\\".Browne, Paul. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (2003 remaster). Sleeve notes. Virgin Records. \\"Julia's Song\\", \\"Electricity\\" and \\"The Misunderstanding\\" were holdovers from the Id. The included tracks were composed during the previous four years, and included OMD's first ever composition, \\"Electricity\\", and the last song written for the album, \\"Pretending to See the Future\\". According to keyboardist Paul Humphreys, the primary influences on the record were Brian Eno, Neu! and Kraftwerk. =Artwork= The sleeve was designed by graphic designer Peter Saville and interior designer Ben Kelly, based on a door designed by Kelly. It featured a die-cut grid through which the orange inner sleeve was visible. Saville and Kelly won a Designers and Art Directors Award for their work on the album. Frontman Andy McCluskey has stated that OMD did not fully understand the royalty system at the time, and that the band \\"had a sleeve that cost us so much to manufacture that for every record we sold we were barely earning pennies\\", although Carol Wilson of Dindisc disputed this, saying the cost to the band for the sleeve was contractually fixed and Virgin took the expense. Reception and legacy Reviews of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were positive.Waller, Johnny; Humphreys, Mike. Messages. Sidgwick & Jackson. 1987. . p. 68. Paul Morley in the New Musical Express wrote: \\"How fine and different their melodies can be, how detailed and distinctive their song-structure... there is a constant change in emphasis and dynamics. It's definitely dance music. Orch Man's debut LP is one of the best of the year.\\" Melody Maker journalist Ian Birch called the record \\"Unpretentious, tuneful and unceasingly pleasant\\". Sounds and International Musician also offered positive reviews. In a retrospective appraisal for Pitchfork, Scott Plagenhoef opined: \\"Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's original release was highlighted by the exquisite 'Electricity' and the brooding 'The Messerschmit Twins'... the elegant 'Messages' stands out next to the record's often sparse, minimalist soundscapes.\\" Ned Raggett in AllMusic said: \\"OMD's first full album won as much attention for its brilliant die-cut cover -- another example of Peter Saville's cutting-edge way around design -- as for its music, and its music is wonderful... Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark is just like the band that made it -- perfectly of its time and easily transcending it.\\" Trouser Press called the record \\"a demonstration of stylish electro-pop\\" with \\"a knack for melodies and hooks\\". Musician Vince Clarke has cited the album as one of his primary influences, with \\"Electricity\\" being the track that moved him to pursue a career in electronic music. Rock group ZZ Top, with whom OMD shared a studio on a 1980 edition of BBC2 show The Old Grey Whistle Test while promoting Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, became fans upon hearing the material and would play the record over their PA system prior to concerts.

The SB is empowered to acquire and develop intelligence on internal and external threats to the nation, subversive activities, extremist activities and activities of sabotage and spying. It is also empowered to analyse and advise on the necessary course of action to the various departments and agencies both within the Police Department and other related agencies. In the past, they have worked together in reforming the Thai Special Branch.Comber, 257. The SB is the successor of the Malayan Security Service.Comber, page 3 Administration The SB was initially modelled after the Special Branch of the United Kingdom. Activities =Communist insurgency (1948‚Äì1989)= During the Malayan Emergency, when the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) guerrillas were in open revolt, the Special Branch successfully infiltrated the party chain of command. Reportedly, one Special Branch officer managed to gain sufficient trust from the MCP to be ordered to infiltrate the Special Branch. He in turn managed to feed false information back to the MCP. It has also been claimed that the second-most high-ranking official in the MCP was a Special Branch agent, who was executed when he was discovered. The Special Branch's activities during the Emergency were widely praised, garnering accolades such as one calling it \\"one of the finest establishments of its kind in the world\\". Other intelligence agencies sent observers to a Special Branch training centre in the Malayan capital of Kuala Lumpur to learn its tactics of infiltration and espionage. It was during this period that the British \\"Asianized\\" the Special Branch, replacing its crop of British spies and officers with trained locals.Ongkili, James P. (1985). Nation-building in Malaysia 1946‚Äì1974, p. 79. Oxford University Press. . =Anwar Ibrahim scandal= In 1998, former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was charged with sodomy and corruption, both crimes in Malaysia. During his trial, a number of statements were made by Special Branch officials, who had been implicated in the case. One allegation made against Anwar was that he had ordered Special Branch officials to obtain retractions of the sodomy-related allegations against him. However, the Special Branch officials involved told the court that they had reason to believe the charges were fabricated by Anwar's political opponents. Two Special Branch men involved were its then Director, Mohamed Said bin Awang, and Second Deputy Director, Amir bin Junus. One witness at the trial testified that Mohamed Said had told Anwar to allow the Special Branch to look into the matter, instead of Anwar directing the Special Branch to cover it up. During the trial, Mohamed Said shed light on the Special Branch's practices ‚Äî mainly by explaining what was called a \\"turning-over operation\\", whereby retractions were obtained. At one point, he described it as a \\"great secret\\", and refused to elaborate beyond his explanation that \\"Basically we do a quick assessment on our target, then we see how the possibilities are to turn over their stand,\\" and that \\"If it is a certain political stand, we may neutralize the stand if it is a security threat\\". Mohamed Said later responded to the question \\"If someone higher than the deputy prime minister were to instruct you to come and lie to the court here, would you do it?\\" with \\"Depends on the situation.\\" After being pressed for a clarification by the judge, he said, \\"I may or I may not\\". =Raja Petra claims= Raja Petra Kamarudin, a former detainee under the Internal Security Act (ISA), has claimed that when he was brought in for questioning, he was astonished by how well-informed they were about his activities: \\"It was astonishing that they had been able to take all those photographs of me without me realising it. It began to make me wonder whether they had any other photographs of me and my wife in my bedroom doing.....well, you know. ... It was as if they had been present in the meeting room, had participated in the meeting, and had tape-recorded the entire session. We might as well just admit our crime and sign the confession...\\" He also claimed that the Special Branch had successfully infiltrated the hierarchy of several political parties in the country. = The arrest of Mas Selamat Kastari = In February 2008, a major leader of the Singaporean Jemaah Islamiah (JI), Mas Selamat escaped from the Whitley Road Detention Center, a detention centre of the most stringent in Southeast Asia. A few months later, he was found hiding in a village house in Kampung Tawakal, Skudai, 40 km from the city of Johor Bahru. With surveillance and planning with tactical raids were so neat, on 1 April 2009 06:00 AM, with the help from UTK counter-terrorist unit, the Special Branch manage to apprehend the leader of the militants in the home village. UTK outflank every corner of the house when Mas Selamat was sleeping. According to witnesses the incident, Mohd Saat Marjo, 57, who was a neighbour next door, is telling that a UTK armed with automatic weapons, along with members of the Special Branch in plain clothes, stormed the house through two gates which are broken as soon as Mas Selamat refused to come out to surrender even called by the police. The raid and siege of UTK and Special Branch is perfectly done, which led Mas Selamat failed to escape until he was caught. He was handcuffed and his face is covered with dark blue cloth before being taken out. Regular members of JI, Abdul Matin Anol Rahmat and Johar Hassan also was arrested there. Police also seized a number of JI's documents and confidential planning information and send Bomb Disposal Unit to ensure that the house is free of any explosives. However, the involvement of UTK in the operation is not made public because of the high level of secrecy. The arrest was more directed to the Special Branch unit.

Once an independent village in County Durham it became incorporated into Tyne and Wear in 1974 and then the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in 1986. Location Greenside is located in the outer west of Gateshead, between the villages of Crawcrook and High Spen and not far from the small town of Ryton. It also lies near the old lead route that ran from the north Pennines to Tyneside. History Largely rural in nature, Greenside was built upon coal mining and agriculture. However, it was not until the creation of Greenside colliery, along with nearby collieries of Emma, Clara and Stargate, that Greenside and the surrounding area truly grew in importance and its coal industry became extensive. By the early 20th century Greenside had the largest colliery in the district. The colliery closed in July 1966 - the last shift being worked on Saturday 23 July. In 2016 Banner Tales - an organisation dedicated to researching and maintaining the village's mining and industrial heritage - instituted the \\"Last Shift Festival\\" and this has now, under the title \\"Greenside Banner Festival\\",become an annual event. Each year the Greenside Miner's Lodge Banner is marched through the village accompanied by a Brass Band before joining the many other banners at Durham Miner's Gala. Banner Tales also organise the annual Greenside Community Picnic in the spirit of the miners' picnics of the past. The old wagonways used to transport coal, present in both Greenside and Crawcrook, provide a reminder of the area's importance in the coal trade. Although these wagonways and routes are not used to transport coal anymore, they are maintained as public footpaths, taking walkers around the surrounding countryside. Greenside has many residents of Irish descent, who can trace their heritage back to the influx of Irish miners into the town in the 19th century. Local politics In local government, Greenside is located in the 'Crawcrook, Greenside and Clara Vale ward'. The ward is at the far west of Gateshead and borders part of Northumberland. The Crawcrook and Greenside ward is served by three Labour councillors Helen Haran, Kath MacCartney and Jack Graham. Gateshead Council is Labour controlled. Greenside is located within the parliamentary constituency of Blaydon. Its current MP is Labour's Liz Twist. Economy After the decline of the coal-industry Greenside has not suffered the great deprivation that many other former mining areas have. One of the least deprived of Gateshead's wards, it is used increasingly as a commuter village for professionals travelling into the more urban areas of Tyneside. Employment is usually in manufacturing retail and rapping industry, although the Crawcrook and Greenside ward as a whole includes a significant number of Gateshead's managerial-level employees. Although it is a village that has not suffered the decline that many provincial villages have nationally in terms of local services, Greenside offers only a small selection of shops and business. These are enough to meet basic local need on a daily basis. For further groceries and high value white goods residents can travel to the MetroCentre, Europe's largest shopping centre around four miles further into Gateshead, as well as the well developed shopping areas of Newcastle- Upon-Tyne. There is an adequate, although declining, public transport service to meet the basic needs of residents. Bus services operate to Crawcrook, Ryton, Blaydon, the MetroCentre and Newcastle. Residents wishing to travel west, past the county border into Northumberland and its towns such as Prudhoe, Stocksfield, Corbridge and Hexham can do so on one of a number of Go North East buses that depart from Crawcrook.

It was formed as the successor to the disbanded United Party (UP) in 1977 and as a merger with the smaller Democratic Party. It drew its support mainly from the then Province of Natal, and tried to strike a moderate course between the apartheid policy of the ruling National Party (NP) and the liberal policies of the Progressive Federal Party (PFP).  Background  The United Party had been the main opposition in the House of Assembly since it lost power in the 1948 election, but it was severely weakened by a split in 1975. To gain new support, the UP then merged with the Democratic Party to form the New Republic Party in 1977. After the UP wound up, the last UP leader, Sir de Villiers Graaff served as the interim national leader of the new party, with Radclyffe Cadman as parliamentary leader. Before the 1977 election, Graaff resigned and Cadman became the national leader. However, a significant number of UP parliamentarians refused to remain with the new party; some joined the anti- apartheid PFP, and six were expelled and formed the centrist South African Party, eventually joining the majority NP. The NRP held 23 seats at the dissolution of parliament in 1977, down from the 41 the United Party had held previously.  Election results  The 1977 South African general election left the New Republic Party with only 10 parliamentary seats, and it lost the position as official opposition to the Progressive Federal Party. As Cadman was defeated in the election, a new leader was needed.Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1978, page 28813 Vause Raw was elected leader of the New Republic Party.H-Net Review: F. A.

In fact, the NRP would win just two by-elections during its eleven- year existence: a provincial council seat in Natal, South Coast in July 1979, and another in East London in October 1980. In August 1980, Raw announced that the party was \\"broke\\" outside of Natal. The party's support base stabilised somewhat, and it lost only 2 seats in the 1981 South African general election, while retaining eight. The election however confirmed the NRP:s status as a Natal-based party. Almost all its members in the House of Assembly were from Natal, and it won the 1981 election to the Natal Provincial Council, securing 14 of the 20 seats available.Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1981, page 30973 By contrast, the party won only 1 out of 55 seats on the Cape Provincial Council, and no seats at all on the Transvaal Provincial Council. In 1984, Raw was replaced as leader by Bill Sutton. However, the NP's shift towards reform in the early 1980s under the leadership of P. W. Botha would allow it to make inroads in the NRP's remaining voter base and the party retained only 1 seat, held by Sutton, in the 1987 South African general election, the last one it contested. Sutton retained his seat until the 1989 election.  Platform and dissolution  The anti-apartheid PFP considered the NRP \\"thoroughly racist\\", and the two parties \\"declared war\\" on each other. After the NRP stepped down from a by-election, which the NP subsequently won, the PFP accused the NRP of dealing with the NP in order to defeat their common enemy, the PFP. The primary policy of the NRP was to introduce a multi-chambered parliament, with a chamber each for whites, coloureds, Indians, and urban blacks. However, in 1982 the Nationalist government announced plans for a Tricameral Parliament, which was to represent coloureds, Indians, and whites. Blacks were not represented, even though the government no longer officially expected them to migrate to the bantustans. Nevertheless, the Tricameral Parliament's marked similarity to the NRP's policy meant that it was increasingly difficult to strike a moderate course between the NP and the liberal PFP. The Tricameral policy, and an announcement that it would talk to revolutionary groups, gained the NP liberal support. There was now little enough space for the PFP to occupy on the left of white public opinion, and no room whatsoever for the NRP to split the difference between the NP and the PFP. This was shown by the party's disastrous showing in the 1987 election. It disbanded in 1988. On dissolving the NRP, Sutton recommended that party members throw their support to the Independent Party of Dennis Worrall. The IP and other NRP remnants would later merge with the PFP to form the Democratic Party, which later became the Democratic Alliance.

Battles Defeat against Athiyaman In 118 CE, he waged war on Thagadoor against the famous AthiyamƒÅn NedumƒÅn A√±ci. It was an attempt fuelled by his longtime desire to become an emperor equivalent in power to the Cholas. After a fierce battle, KƒÅri would lose Kovalur to AthiyamƒÅn and would only regain it much later after Peruncheral Irumporai sacks Tagadur.History of Tamilnad:to A.D. 1565, page 66 Victory against ≈åri In 120 CE, the Chera king Paalai paadiya Perum Cheral Irumporrai sought his strategic help in the conquest of Kollimalai. Kaari agreed to conquer Kollimalai for the Chera and it was agreed that the Chera should on his behalf invade Thagadoor in order to avenge his earlier defeat. This strange pact was due to the strategically important easy access points favouring the Chera and Kaari in the case of Thagadoor and Kollimalai respectively. KƒÅri defeated and killed ≈åri, another king and took Kolli Hills.Studies in Tamil Literature and History, page 56 In turn the Chera undertook the march of Thagadoor, which is memorialized in the Thagadoor Yaaththirai of Sangam literature. Turn of events Thus with the help of the Chera, Kaari was climbing on the ladder to become an emperor. He began to overshadow the Chola King Killi Valavan. This prompted the Chola king to check Kaari's growth with an invasion on Thirukkoiloor. The battles were fierce, but Kaari was determined to win or die. As a result, the Cholas lost 10,000 soldiers in the first five days of the war. But on the sixth day the Malaiyamaan princes, Kaari's three-year-old twin sons, were caught by the intruding Chola spies, giving the Cholas an edge. Killi Valavan began dictating terms and Kaari was forced to venture into the enemy campsite, where he was caught and killed immediately. The Chola king planned to crush the two princes by walking an elephant over them, but by the timely intervention of poet K≈çv≈´r KizhƒÅr, he changed his mind. *excerpt from Purananuru song 46 by K≈çv≈´r KizhƒÅr: The boys were raised with the patronage of the emperor and served as generals of the Chola army under Killi and his son Rasasuyam Vaetta Peru Nal Killi. After the death of Vƒìl PƒÅri, another king, poet Kapilar takes the daughters of the former and leaves them in the care of Brahmins. Later poet Auvaiyar takes them and marries them to Deiveegan of the Malaiyaman family.The culture and history of the Tamils Kadai ezhu vallal Malayamaan Thirumudi Kaari is considered one of the seven greatest \\"bestowers\\" of the last Sangam era ‚Äì the Kadai Ezhu Vallalgal . The people of his time considered him the most modest of kings. Nobody left empty-handed after paying a visit to him and the visitor who came on barefoot would usually return mounted on a horse or an elephant of his choice. He called himself not a king but a \\"rightful servant of his beloved people\\". *excerpt from Purananuru, song 123 by Kapilar: Modesty During peacetime, the king of Mulloor and Thirukkoiloor would usually start his daily routine in the paddy (nel), saamai and thinai fields working with his plough and sickle. He was strong and said to be so kind-hearted that he would rather plough his fields by hand than to trouble bulls to work for him. In one story about Kaari, the Tamil poet and saint Avvaiyaar II happened to pass by his field on course a long journey. Kaari quickly recognized the tired \\"mother\\" and without introducing himself requested that she look after his field for a few minutes and help herself to his rations in the meantime, so that he could go to a nearby pond to fetch some water. The king was away for long during which time the saint ate well and fell asleep. When sun rose the next day, Kaari returned to the field to find old mother angry. Kaari revealed his identity and explained that since she was a great friend of Athiyamaan of Thagadoor, who was his archrival, he feared she would not agree if he asked her to rest in his land. So he had to make her stay a while and bestow his land with her saintly presence. Avvaiyaar, flattered, blessed his country with perennial prosperity. From inscriptions and literature There are a lot of inscriptions available about various chiefs from the Malaiyaman family. They mostly suffixed the title ChƒìdirƒÅyan to the name of the reigning Chola king whom they served. For example, we have Vikramasola ChƒìdirƒÅyan and his son Vikramasola Kovalarayan, Kulottungasola ChƒìdirƒÅyan etc.The role of feudatories in later Ch≈ç·∏∑a history, page 172 They were rulers of Miladu and also bore titles such as Milad-udaiyan meaning lord of Miladu, Maladu-mannar or king of the inhabitants of hills, Malaiya-manattarkukku arasar or the king of inhabitants of the great country of hills or Malayarayar. Miladu or Maladu is a very pure Tamil form of Malainadu or the hill country. Meyporunayanar, a Chƒìdi king from Tirukovalur is mentioned in the Periyapuranam.WhatsInIndia: Another important person from the same line was Pillai PerumƒÅl ChƒìdirƒÅyan, a contemporary of poet Kambar.A topographical list of the inscriptions of the Madras Presidency, collected till 1915: with notes and references, Volume 1, page 136 We have a lot of chiefs of the Malaiyaman family making donations to temples in and around Tirukoyilur. For example, we find that Kulothunga Chola II gifted some lands for the puja at the local Vishnu temple at the request of Kulottungasola ChƒìdirƒÅyan(ARE 124 of 1900). We have another chief called Rajendra Chola ChƒìdirƒÅyan making donations to the temple(ARE 388 of 1909) in Tirukkoyilur.

It serves as a short freeway connection between the Interstate 80/Interstate 80 Business junction and Auburn Boulevard (the old Lincoln Highway - former U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 99E). SR 244 was first added to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative Route 288, and was renumbered as SR 244 in the 1964 renumbering. Portions of this route have been removed from the system as recently as 1994. Route description SR 244 starts just east of the westernmost ramps to the Watt Avenue exit off I-80. Just east of this, there are several connector ramps to both I-80 and Business I-80 as SR 244 passes under the terminus of Business I-80. SR 244 terminates at Auburn Boulevard, having just entered the Sacramento city limits near Renfree Park. SR 244 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History Legislative Route 288 was defined in 1959 as a proposed route from pre-1964 Legislative Route 3 and pre-1964 Legislative Route 242 (now I-80 and SR 51) northeast of Sacramento east to pre-1964 Legislative Route 249 (unbuilt State Route 65 - approximately Sunrise Boulevard) near Fair Oaks. In the 1964 renumbering, this was assigned the number Route 244. In 1965, an extension was defined from SR 65 east to U.S. Route 50. In 1972 a series of \\"volatile\\" public hearings took place where local residents protested the construction of this route among others being proposed in the Sacramento area. This extension to U.S. Route 50 was removed in 1975, and the route's definition was truncated to end at Fair Oaks Boulevard near San Juan Avenue. The public forums ended in mid-1976 after the Board of Supervisors abandoned plans for all three routes. It was truncated further to Auburn Boulevard, its present terminus, in 1994. The bridges along the route date from 1971, a year after the bridges on I-80 to the west; that part of I-80 was Interstate 880 until 1981.

The area consists of a traditional crofting and fishing community of a couple of hundred houses located between mountain and shore on a peninsula looking over the Summer Isles and the sea. The main settlement is Achiltibuie. Like its northerly neighbour, Assynt in Sutherland, Coigach has mountains which rise sharply from quiet, lochan-studded moorland, and a highly indented rocky coast with many islands, bays and headlands. The highest summit is Ben Mor Coigach at 743 metres; the distinctive profile of Stac Pollaidh is the other main peak within Coigach. The scenic qualities of Coigach, along with neighbouring Assynt, have led to the area being designated as the Assynt- Coigach National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland. The name is derived from the Gaelic for \\"five\\" or \\"fifths\\", and refers to the five townships of Achduart, Achnacarinan, Acheninver, Achnahaird and Achiltibuie. Local government Coigach formed a barony of the civil parish of Loch Broom. In 1690 it was transferred into the county of Cromartyshire,Mackenzie 1810, pp.15‚Äì16 and indeed it was the largest single portion of land in the county, which consisted of a series of unconnected exclaves. Until changes in civil registration districts in 1857 the barony also included Isle Martin, the lands down to Corrie beyond Ullapool, the various farms of Strathkanaird and to the east the Forest of Achall and Rhiddorach. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 provided that \\"the counties of Ross and Cromarty shall cease to be separate counties, and shall be united for all purposes whatsoever, under the name of the county of Ross and Cromarty\\", and Coigach thus became part of Ross and Cromarty. Although the counties were replaced by a system of regional and district councils in 1975 Coigach remains part of Ross and Cromarty for purposes such as land registration and lieutenancy. The regions and districts were replaced by unitary councils in 1996, and Coigach now forms a community within Highland council area. In 2010 a community development company was established on the initiative of the community council. Key issues to be addressed by the company are affordable housing, the provision of health services, the ageing demographic profile of the area and promoting economic development. The lack of tourist facilities, and of a ‚Äòbrand‚Äô for Coigach, were also concerns. A subsidiary of the Coigach Community Development Company, Coigach Wind Power, operates a 500 kW wind turbine to raise funds for the development company's projects. Conservation The Coigach and Assynt Living Landscape Project is a community partnership project which aims to bring environmental and economic benefits to the Coigach and Assynt regions of North West Scotland. The partnership includes landowners (private and community), the local community and charitable organisations, with the Scottish Wildlife Trust being the lead partner. The project is described as an \\"ecosystem restoration project\\", and aims to \\"bring woodland connectivity, species-rich flora and fauna, and economic growth back to the Scottish uplands\\". History During the Highland Clearances, attempts were made to evict the crofting tenants of Coigach in 1852-53. However, the women of Coigach disarmed twenty policemen and sheriff officers, burning their summonses and throwing their batons into the sea. The men of Coigach formed the second line of defense should the women receive any ill-treatment. The officers of the law returned home without having served a single summons or evicting a single crofter. Four weeks later these events were repeated when six constables took on the women again, but with no more success, leaving the land-lord extremely frustrated. The crofters of Coigach had held out for more than two years and eventually the estate managers and the land-lord gave up in trying to resettle them. Coigach was a rare victory for the people over the landlord.

Note the ornate roof decoration, latticed window (left), and garland hung across the closed double doors (right). The Janus stood in the Roman Forum near the Basilica Aemilia, along the Argiletum. It had gates at both ends, and inside was a statue of Janus, the two-faced god of boundaries and beginnings. Its doors were known as the \\"Gates of Janus\\", and were closed in times of peace and opened in times of war. There are many theories about its original purpose; some say that it was a bridge over the Velabrum, and some say it functioned as a gate to the Capitoline.Coarelli, Filippo. ‚ÄúRoman Forum.‚Äù In Rome and Environs: An Archaeological Guide, 51. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014. This article includes the origins, legends, and modern remains of the Temple of Janus in the Roman Forum.  Origins  According to Livy 1.19 the second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius, decided to distract the early, warlike Romans from their violent ways by instilling in them awe and reverence. His projects included promoting religion, certain priesthoods, and the building of temples as a distraction with the beneficial effect of imbuing spirituality. The Janus in the Roman Forum, although not a temple was claimed to be Numa's most famous architectural project. In the early stages of the city of Rome, the inhabitants lived in separate walled villas. The Janus was the gate from the Forum to the rest of the Rome as originally the Forum was the courtyard of the king's villa. Wright, Horace W. \\"The Janus Shrine of the Forum.\\" American Journal of Archaeology 29, no. 1 (1925): 79-81. Accessed April 12, 2020. doi:10.2307/497726.  Ancient descriptions  Plutarch, in Life of King Numa, wrote: > [Janus] also has a temple at Rome with double doors, which they call the > gates of war; for it always stands open in time of war, but is closed when > peace has come. The latter was a difficult matter, and it rarely happened, > since the realm was always engaged in some war, as its increasing size > brought it into collision with the barbarous nations which encompassed it > round about. But in the time of Augustus it was closed, after he had > overthrown Mark Antony; and before that, when Marcus Atilius and Titus > Manlius were consuls, it was closed for a short time; then war broke out > again at once, and it was opened.Plutarch's Lives Volume 1  The gates of Janus  The gates of the Janus were the most important part of the structure. Their opening and closing was the reason for its existence. The gates played a large part in Roman religion as it concerned war, and was something that military leaders had to take seriously to have the support of the people. There are many historical sources which confirm that the gates were closed during times of peace and open during times of war. Each of those sources presents different reasons for the openings and closings: Ennius and Virgil said the gates held Discord and Fury inside the temple during times of peace, some interpretations of Horace imply that peace was imprisoned and guarded by the closed gates, while others say Janus himself was locked inside during times of peace. No matter which interpretation is used, it was seen as a point of pride for all the leaders of Rome to have the gates closed during their rule. Green, S J. ‚ÄúMultiple Interpretation of the Opening and Closing of the Temple of Janus: A Misunderstanding of Ovid ‚ÄòFasti‚Äô 1.281.‚Äù Mnemosyne, June 2000, 302‚Äì9.  The gates in use  During Numa's reign, the Gates of Janus were closed as Rome was at peace. The next king, Tullus Hostilius, opened the Gates of Janus when he went to war with Alba Longa. The Gates of Janus remained open for the next 400 years until after the First Punic War when T. Manlius Torquatus closed the Gates of Janus in 235 BC. This closure lasted about eight years. War with the Gauls in Northern Italy forced the Gates of Janus to reopen. They did not close again until 29 BC, following the deaths of Antony and Cleopatra.Syme, Ronald. ‚ÄúProblems about Janus.‚Äù The American Journal of Philology 100, no. 1 (1979): 188-212. The Res Gestae Divi Augusti, a first-person account of the life of Augustus, claims: > The Janus Quirinus, which our ancestors wished to be closed whenever peace > had been secured by victories throughout the Roman empire by land and sea, > was recorded to have been closed, before I was born, twice altogether since > the foundation of the city, but the senate decreed that it should be closed > on three occasions while I was princeps.Res Gestae Divi Augusti, paragraph > 13, translation from Wikisource From Cassius Dio 51.20 and 53.27 we are able to date the first two closures in Augustus's reign to 29 and 25 BC respectively. The exact date of the third closure remains a matter of scholarly debate. The only ancient author to date it was Orosius,Orosius In Paganos 6.22 who associates the event with the birth of Christ, traditionally (but probably incorrectly) assigned to December 1 BC. However, modern scholars almost universally reject Orosius because Roman armies were campaigning in Germany and/or the Far East at this time. Inez Scott Ryberg and Gaius Stern date the third closure more plausibly to 13 BC based on the joint return of Augustus and Agrippa to Rome after pacifying the provinces.Inez Scott Ryberg, \\"The Procession of the Ara Pacis,\\" MAAR 19 (1949), 77-101; Gaius Stern, Women, Children and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae (Berkeley diss. 2006), and \\"How Many Lictors are on the Ara Pacis Augustae?\\" CAMWS 2007 Sir Ronald SymeRonald Syme History in Ovid (1977), 24 ff, and \\"Problems with Janus,\\" AJP 100 (1979), 188 ff dated the closure to 7 BC, to coincide with the triumph of Tiberius and his second consulship, the events of which year are lost in a gap in the surviving manuscripts of Cassius Dio. Mario Torelli followed Orosius' date.Mario Torelli, Structure and Typology of Roman Historical Reliefs, (1982) Chapter 2: ‚ÄúA New Start: The Ara Pacis Augustae\\" Nero coin: Obverse: Nero; Reverse: Ara Pacis Later emperors also closed the Gates of the Janus to great fanfare. The most famous closures occurred under Nero and Vespasian. Nero minted a large series of coins with the Ara Pacis (and the Janus itself with closed gates) on the reverse to commemorate this event. Other emperors certainly closed and reopened the Gates of the Janus, but references in later and less thorough historians are fairly rare. The Roman poet Virgil included in the Aeneid the opening of the Gates of the Janus to start war between the Trojans and the Latins.Vergil Aeneid 7  Later historical contexts  The legends of Janus have been used for many purposes throughout history. 16th century Roman priests used them to justify the seat of Christianity being moved from Rome to Jerusalem and described the Vatican as the ‚ÄúThrone of Janus‚Äù. This was done to gain traction in Italy through the perceived support of the ‚Äúgod of beginnings‚Äù.Temple, Nicholas. ‚ÄúSt. Peter's Basilica: Orientation and Succession.‚Äù In Revovatio Urbis: Architecture, Urbanism, and Ceremony in the Rome of Julius II, 189‚Äì94. New York, NY: Routledge, 2011. The story of the Gates of Janus was also used by British political and military leaders during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They portrayed the opening of the Gates as a part of the glory of war and used the legend to add honour to the wars over control of their empire. Nabulsi, Karma. ‚ÄúHigh Priests of the Temple of Janus: The Martial Traditions of War.‚Äù In Traditions of War: Occupation, Resistance, and the Law, 102‚Äì26. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999.  Construction of the temple  There is very little remaining today from any of the reconstructions of the Janus. A small portion of the surviving brick structure can be found beside the ruins of the Basilica Aemilia, along the path of the Argiletum in the Roman Forum. Coarelli, Filippo. ‚ÄúRoman Forum.‚Äù In Rome and Environs: An Archaeological Guide, 51. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014. Despite very little of the structure remaining, a lot of information about the construction can be determined from other archeological evidence. There is evidence of many reconstructions from the building's depictions on coins. The various styles of architecture seen on those coins suggest rough dates for the reconstructions; both in the third and fourth centuries BCE.M√ºller, Valentine. \\"The Shrine of Janus Geminus in Rome.\\" American Journal of Archaeology 47, no. 4 (1943): 437-40. Accessed April 12, 2020. doi:10.2307/499831. The style of arch shown on the coins minted under Nero suggest a rebuild during the fourth century BCE, and the artistic masonry shown also suggests work was done during the third century BCE. Accounts of the temple say it was made of bronze, but due to the depiction on the coins it is assumed that only the interior was sheathed in bronze, as the exterior is shown with Ashlar masonry.

Mandel Karlsson, also known as 91:an Karlsson or simply 91:an, is a Swedish comic book character and the main protagonist in the comic strip series 91:an (Eng: ‚Ññ 91). He was created in 1932 by Rudolf Petersson. The series is now published in its own bi-weekly comic book, 91:an, and also as a single strip in the popular weekly women's magazine √Öret Runt. Mandel's personality Mandel Karlsson is based on two people Rudolf Petersson met during his national service at I 16. During his service he met a blond and ill tempered Sm√•landian who turned soft by accordion music and a friendly, short haired person. Some of the attributes were switched and the result was 91:an and 87:an Axelsson. Mandel Karlsson has always been a likeable and sympathetic character: willing to get up to all sorts of youthful mischief, but clearly a kind soul at heart. During the first three decades Mandel was very fond of fighting, but a less aggressive, gentler character was developed during the highly successful period of Nils Egerbrandt's work, starting in the 1960s. Mandel Karlsson is a young man, aged perhaps 20 or 21, doing conscribed military service in the Swedish Army, based at the fictional Klackamo Regiment. His number is \\"91\\", thus he is widely known in Sweden as \\"91:an Karlsson\\", although in the comic strip itself he is almost always referred to as Mandel (Eng: Almond, an extremely unusual first name), or simply 91:an. The son of Mandolina and Johan Karlsson, Mandel comes from a working-class rural background. He often uses non-standard dialect expressions and vocabulary, has a wonderful rapport with animals, and is a competent accordionist. Formerly a frequent smoker, he has now kicked the habit. He is very keen on his girlfriend Elvira Olsson, although they have regular fall-outs, but he is far from \\"forward\\" sexually: indeed Elvira often has to take the initiative in matters romantic. He has been known to express a lively interest in other young ladies who meet his acquaintance, although less so than some of his fellow conscripts at the Klackamo Regiment. His sidekick, Lars Fjodor Axelsson, is a brasher, naughtier character, and has frequently tried to rival Mandel for the attentions of Elvira. Mandel is well liked by the senior officers at the regiment and is soon forgiven his frequent transgression of the rules. He often does chores for √ñverste Gyllenskalp at home, for example walking his Great Dane, Caesar. Media adaptations The comics were adapted into a theatrical play and a series of films.

The school is part of the North Scott Community School District, and has an enrollment of approximately 1,000 students in grades nine through 12. Located at 200 South First Street in Eldridge (approximately one mile west of U.S. Highway 61), North Scott High School draws students from several communities in northern Scott County, Iowa, including Eldridge, Dixon, Donahue, Long Grove, Maysville, McCausland, Park View, Princeton and surrounding rural areas. History North Scott High School was completed in 1958 at a cost of $1.2 million, and originally conceived as a junior-senior high facility. Prior to the school's opening, students living in what is now the North Scott School District completed their high school education at one of a number of area high schools ‚Äì which included Clinton, Davenport (now Davenport Central), LeClaire (now part of the Pleasant Valley Community School District), Wheatland (now Calamus-Wheatland) or DeWitt. Junior high students continued to attend the high school until 1975, when they were moved into the newly built North Scott Junior High School. The junior high building is located approximately one-quarter mile southwest of the high school campus. The high school has undergone many renovations and additions during its 60-year history. A fine arts auditorium, a 900-seat venue opened in 1982; the auditorium was extensively remodeled in 2017 and 2018. The athletic lobby, cafeteria and administrative offices were also extensively remodeled twice, in 1983 and in 2015. Other additions have included an auxiliary gymnasium, a special education wing, modern media center with computer labs (updated in the 2010s) and a science and music wing on the school's west end. In August 2005, North Scott High School received an $800,000 Smaller Learning Communities Grant aimed at assisting students during their high school years. Fine arts Lancer Productions offers at least three shows a year with chances for students to participate on and off stage. Troupe 739 in the International Thespian Society.

It is found in ‚Äúboth hemispheres between the latitudes 30¬∞ and 50¬∞ north and south\\". The diseases symptoms include: damping off and collar rot of seedlings, stem canker, rood disease, and, most commonly, shoot blight. These symptoms have caused significant economic loss to nurseries and pine plantations. In a nursery in the north-central United States, losses of 35% have been reported. Shoot blight and eventual die back can cause a reduction of marketable volume in timber by 63%. Infection of terminal shoots can result in dead-top which significantly limits the usable length of the tree trunk. The presence of the pathogen in concert with severe weather conditions can lead to extreme loss. Following a severe hailstorm in South Africa, nearly 5,000 acres of pine plantation were infected with Diplodia tip blight. It was necessary to prematurely harvest large swaths of the plantations resulting in a loss of 45%. Areas that were not harvested prematurely still suffered an average timber loss of 11%.  Hosts and Symptoms Diplodia tip blight is a common disease among conifers, especially pines. Scots pine, red pine, Mugo pine, Ponderosa pine, and Austrian pine are especially susceptible. Some spruce, fir, and cedar species are also vulnerable to infection. The disease can infect trees of all ages, though trees that are physiologically stressed through water or nutrient deficiencies or wounded via extreme weather or insect damage have a higher incidence of infection. The hallmark symptom of Sphaeropsis blight is stunted, brown needles and stems, particularly of new shoots. The needles of infected shoots typically remain attached, are shorter than average and are tan colored. In particularly severe cases, entire branches can become infected. Resinous cankers can form on the stems, leading to disfigurement and sometimes death of the tree. In addition to the symptoms of the disease, signs of the pathogen are also evident in the late summer and fall as the fungal survival structures, pycnidia, are formed. The pycnidia appear as small black dots and can be found at the base of the needles, on the scales of the seed cones, and on the bark of the tree. The presence of these fungal survival structures in conjunction with the blighted shoots provides powerful diagnostic evidence for this disease.  Disease cycle The spores from Sphaeropsis sapinea fungus typically first develop on the structures that will eventually develop on the ‚Äúblack fruiting structures that form on needles, fascicle sheaths, scales of second year seed cones, and bark‚Äù Sphaeropsis (Diplodia) blight During the wet/rainy season, (depending on the location, could be from early spring until late fall) where the wet weather and wind can allow the spores to travel, as well as allow them to germinate the shoots and needles of the trees. Penetration of the shoots and needles normally occurs through the stomata opening or through the epidermis of young stems. Once the needles are infected, the fungus quickly destroys the tissues within the needle which is the cause for the shoot and needles to become stunted and die after only a small amount of growth. The growth of the fungus is quick and deadly to the needles, traveling ‚Äúthrough the needle, then to the stem, and finally into adjacent needles‚Äù.Sphaeropsis Blight or Diplodia Tipblight of Pines - Integrated Pest Management, University of Illinois The needles and stems that have matured or have survived uninfected through the previous years growth, as well as the pollen cones do not normally become infected. It is usually the new needles that are just beginning to form or have yet to form that are most susceptible to attack. During the winter, the Sphaeropsis sapinea fungus survives inside of ‚Äúfruiting structures that develop on infected second-year cones, blighted needles, shoots, and cankers‚Äù.  Management  = Cultural = Preventing the initial infection is a better strategy than attempting to cure a diseased tree. The first line of defense in preventing disease is planting disease free stock, planting in a disease free area, and selecting a disease resistant species. Beyond the selection of clean, resistant stock and planting location, trees that have proper water and nutrient management are healthier and less susceptible to Sphaeropsis blight. Controlling wood boring insects that create wounds for Diplodia to exploit, is another cultural practice that can prevent disease. Poor airflow and high humidity are conditions that favor disease development; keeping grass and weeds trimmed down at the base of the tree allows for better airflow and can limit disease development. Once a tree is diseased, the goal is to limit the amount of inoculum present. The blighted needles and cones will have the pycnidia survival structures that contain thousands of spores. Remove debris from the base of the tree and destroy. During dry weather (not during Spring or early Summer), cut away infected shoots, cones, and branches. Sanitary techniques like sanitizing pruning tools between each cut will prevent further spread of the disease. = Chemical = When disease pressure is high, chemical controls is advised. First, spray should occur early spring at candle elongation. Repeated sprays should occur every two weeks until needles reach full size. Fungicides containing the following active ingredients have been shown to be efficacious: chlorothalonil, methyl, thiophanate-methyl, mancozeb, and copper hydroxide with mancozeb. Always read and follow the label.

Haines was a star of the New York Giants football team in his time and has the distinction of being the only athlete to have played on national championship teams in both baseball and football. He won the 1923 World Series with the New York Yankees and the 1927 NFL Championship with the New York Giants. Biography Haines was born in Red Lion, Pennsylvania. He batted and threw right-handed, was 5'10\\" in height and 170 pounds in weight. Haines graduated from Red Lion High School in 1916 and attended Lebanon Valley College, where he played a major role in shaping their football program. Haines left Lebanon Valley in 1918 to serve in World War I. After serving in World War I, he attended Penn State University in 1919. He earned varsity letters in baseball, football, and basketball, and joined Delta Upsilon fraternity. Haines earned All-American honors in both football and baseball while at Penn State. He is in the Red Lion Area Senior High School's Hall of Fame. Professional career On April 20, 1923, Haines made his Major League debut at the age of 24. He only played one season, and was used many times as a defensive replacement/pinch runner. In his first three appearances, he was used as a pinch runner, coming around to score on all three occasions. In his overall 28 games, he collected nine runs, four hits, two doubles, three RBI, three stolen bases and a .160 batting average. In the field, Haines was flawless. He had a 1.000 fielding percentage with 17 chances. Haines appeared in two World Series games in 1923, registering one at bat without a hit. As a pinch runner, however, he was able to score one run: the tying run for the Yankees in the final game. Haines stayed in the game defensively, and was playing center field when the Yankees recorded the last out in the 1923 World Series to become world champions. This was Haines' last professional baseball appearance. In the fall, he played professional football and was the quarterback of the 1927 New York Giants team‚Äîa team that won the Giants' first NFL championship. Joe Guyon was with him in the backfield. After playing for the Giants from 1925 to 1928, he played for the Staten Island Stapletons in 1929 and 1931, a team that he also coached. After his career as halfback for the Giants ended, he became their offensive coach from 1926 through 1931. Haines was an NFL official for a time after he finished coaching. In later years, Haines settled in the Philadelphia area where he became active in Little Theater as an actor and director. He died on January 9, 1979 in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania. His body was laid to rest in Middletown Cemetery in Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.

At the entrance to the Prague Zoo. A walking bus (crocodile, walking school bus) is a form of student transport for schoolchildren who, chaperoned typically by two adults (a \\"driver\\" leads and a \\"conductor\\" follows), walk to school along a set route, with some similarities to a school bus route. Like a real bus, walking buses have a fixed route with designated \\"bus stops\\" and \\"pick up times\\" at which they pick up and \\"drop off\\" children. History The concept of the walking bus was first invented in Japan Australian transport activist David Engwicht is often given credit for inventing the WSB system in the 1990s. It was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1998 by Hertfordshire County Council. It was first used by pupils of Wheatfields Junior School in St Albans, the United Kingdom in 1998 BBC News Article Walking Buses have remained popular in the United Kingdom and have recently gained a level of popularity elsewhere in Europe, North America\\"Start a Walking School Bus\\", Partnership for a Walkable America and New Zealand. Proponents of walking buses say that its aims are to:The Official Website of International Walk to School *Encourage physical activity by teaching children the skills to walk safely, how to identify safe routes to school, and the benefits of walking *Raise awareness of the extent of a community's walkability and where improvements can be made *Raise concern for the environment *Reduce crime and take back neighborhoods for people on foot *Reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and speed near schools *Share valuable time with local community leaders, parents, and children In Auckland, New Zealand, as of November 2007, one hundred schools ran 230 Walking School Buses with over 4,000 children and 1,500 adults participating.Auckland Regional Transport Authority School Travel Evaluation for the 2007 school year The largest (contiguous) walking bus involved 1,905 participants on 9 November 2012 in Newmarket, Suffolk. Parents and/or children on some walking buses are encouraged to wear brightly-coloured jackets or waistcoats. This has led to criticism that the walking bus is too regimented, and fails to achieve its original purpose of improving children's independent mobility. David Engwicht, whose 1992 book \\"Reclaiming our Cities and Towns\\" is credited by some as the origin of the Walking School Bus concept in New South Wales, has since stated that \\"The moment the Walking Bus turns into an official program, it creates some significant difficulties, particularly in litigious and risk-averse cultures.\\"  Public health  Walking bus stop sign in Letterston, Wales. (The Welsh language text is the name of the school.) The walking school bus can help to reduce childhood obesity rates by increasing active transportation to school. The American Public Health Association cites that participation in active transportation to school has reduced by a third in the last 40 years. This reduction has coincided with an increase in childhood obesity rates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the USA, report that the prevalence of obesity among children has doubled and among adolescents has quadrupled in the past 30 years. In 2012, 18% of children and 21% of adolescents were obese. According to the Safe Routes to School National Partnership, 1 mile of walking equates to 2/3rds of the recommendation of 60 minutes a day. In addition to the potential health benefits, the walking school bus can help children arrive at school safely, on time, and ready to learn. Walking to school counts towards the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Another benefit is the positive association between physical activity and improved academic performance. In a study by the CDC, they found that with a minimum of 60 minutes a day there were increases in academic behavior, cognitive skills and attitudes.https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/health_and_academics/pdf/pa- pe_paper.pdf The communities that support walking buses may see reduced congestion around school grounds. The walking bus is a non-polluting and sustainable transport alternative to cars and buses. In regard to the safety of the walking bus, the section about Safe Routes to School below goes into more detail about improvements being made to increase the safety of commuting pedestrians. The built environment plays the biggest role in whether or not a community is walkable. The built environment consists of the human-made surroundings that affect one's life; including the availability and quality of sidewalks, crosswalks and parks, the amount of traffic and proximity to schools/parks/shops, etc. These factors determine the walkability of an area. Walkability has been shown to be closely tied to childhood obesity. One study found that ‚Äúthe chances of a child being obese or overweight were 20-60 percent higher among children in neighborhoods where it was not safe to walk around or where there were no sidewalks.‚Äù In addition, children in neighborhoods with sidewalks and safe places to cross the street are more likely to be physically active than children living in neighborhoods without those safe infrastructure elements. The walking bus depends on a walkable and safe built environment. Safe Routes to School is US government program that funds improvements in the built environment near schools. Support for the walking bus Sign for a walking bus stop in the Italian city of Zanica A walking bus stop in Germany =Health Benefits= Children who walk or bicycle to school have higher daily levels of physical activity and better cardiovascular fitness than do children who do not actively commute to school. In a study of adolescents, 100% of the students who walked both to and from school met the recommended levels of 60 or more minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity on weekdays. In a pilot, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Houston, Texas, children that were assigned to a Walking School Bus group increased their weekly rate of active commuting by 38.0% over a five-week period, while children assigned to a no intervention group decreased their active commuting rate by a small margin. =Policies and regulations= In 2005, the US Federal Transportation Reauthorization Bill‚ÄîThe Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA-LU 109-59) was passed which provided nearly $1 billion funding to all states for Safe Routes to School (SRTS) programs. The program's purpose is to: ‚Äúenable and encourage children, including those with disabilities, to walk and bicycle to school; to make walking and bicycling to school safe and more appealing; and to facilitate the planning, development and implementation of projects that will improve safety, and reduce traffic, fuel consumption, and air pollution in the vicinity of schools.‚Äù It is a 100% federally funded program which is administered by state departments of transportation. Money goes towards infrastructure-related programs in addition to non-infrastructure activities such as education and enforcement-year time period, restricting data to school-travel hours. This law is central to the success of programs like the Walking Bus because it identifies the many components involved. Active transport to school and examples such as the walking school bus require collaboration from many different sectors (transportation, law enforcement, school policies, and local government to name a few). In addition, the ability to create an environment conducive to walkability is dependent on the built environment as well as numerous policies from these various sectors. According to the Institute of Medicine Report, Measuring Progress in Obesity Prevention, the environment people live in can have a profound effect on the amount of physical activity which they engage in. According to James Sallis in his workshop presentation, informal or formal policies issued by the government or private sector, can affect physical activity in four ways. First, zoning, building codes, public transportation and recreational facility policies affect the ability to engage in physical activity. Second, policies affecting physical activity in schools‚Äîphysical education classes, recess, and walkability to and from school. Policies providing incentives such as parking and commuting in other ways, and insurance subsidies promote walkability and physical activity for adults. Finally, funding policies have a strong influence on physical activity. The 2005 federal law supporting safe Routes to School is meant to facilitate physical activity and increase walkability. Two national programs that focus on physical activity environment policies are the Health and Human Services Healthy People 2020 and the National Physical Activity Plan, sponsored by numerous organizations including the YMCA, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Association. The plan is a public-private partnership to create policies that promote physical activity for all individuals. Healthy People 2020 lists objectives to boost physical activity and also supports the recording of national data to track interventions. These are two examples of policies to promote physical activity. The Walking School Bus fits into their programs because it increases activity and translates a sedentary time of the day (transport in car or bus to school) to an active one.  Safe routes to school  Pedestrian injuries have found to be associated with the built environment elements, rather than with increased walking to school. Safe Routes to School (SRTS) provides federal funds for improvements of the built environment near schools with the goal of increasing walking and biking to school. The effectiveness of SRTS has been demonstrated in multiple studies. One national study analyzed data across 18 states over 16 years. The study compared rates of pedestrian/bicyclist injury in school-aged children to adults, restricting data to school-travel hours. While adult injury rates were largely unchanged over the study period, implementation of SRTS was associated with around a 20% reduction in both pedestrian/bicyclist injury and fatality risk in children. In Texas, traffic crash data over 5 years showed that pedestrian and bicyclist injuries decreased about 40% after the implementation of SRTS. In New York city, SRTS decreased pedestrian injury by one-third in school-age children. The benefits of SRTS may extend beyond children. While the national study showed adult pedestrian injury risk unchanged, both the Texas and New York studies have demonstrated reduced pedestrian injury risk in adults with SRTS interventions. SRTS programs are also effective in increasing walking and bicycling. In California, the effect of SRTS implementation varied widely but rates of observed walking and biking to school increased by 20 to 200%.  Bicycle train  Bicycle train is the same concept but instead of walking the children and adult(s) move by bicycle.SRTS Guide: Walking School Buses and Bicycle Trains - National Center for Safe Routes to School File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (17207259780).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (17207260550).jpg File:Watershed Bike to School Day 3 (17207040338).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (16772322714).jpg File:Watershed Bike to School Day 6 (17394840535).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (17392863542).jpg File:Watershed Bike to School Day 1 (16772324734).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (16772321744).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (17208626799).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (16774566963).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (17207038578).jpg File:Watershed Bike to School Day 5 (17208627499).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (17187393577).jpg File:Gastineau Elementary Bike to School Day (17392862952).jpg Problems In Japan, some traffic accidents have occurred that resulted in the death of multiple schoolchildren who were walking to school in a group.„ÇØ„É¨„Éº„É≥ËªäÂÖÉÈÅãËª¢Êâã„Å´Êá≤ÂΩπ7Âπ¥ 6ÂÖêÁ´•Ê≠ª‰∫°„ÅßÂÆáÈÉΩÂÆÆÂú∞Ë£Å 47NEWS 2011Âπ¥12Êúà19Êó• In response to these accidents, schools have chosen to let their students walk to school via different paths, and cities have chosen to reduce speed limits, install road guards, and paint pedestrian zones to reduce the chance of accidents occurring again.

Espaillat attended the first West Chester University Poetry Conference in 1995 and later recalled, \\"I was the only Hispanic there, but I realized that these people were open to everything, that their one interest was the craft. If you could bring something from another culture, they were open to it.\\"Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant (2018), The Once and Future Muse: The Poetry and Poetics of Rhina P. Espaillat University of Pittsburgh Press. Pages 83-84. Espaillat subsequently took charge of, \\"teaching the French Forms and the forms of repetition,\\" but also made sure to teach classes in, \\"the Spanish and Hispanic examples of the forms\\" such as the d√©cima and the ovillejo.\\" Due to Espaillat's teaching and encouragement, the ovillejo, particularly, has become very popular among younger New Formalists writing in English. While being interviewed for a book about her life, Espaillat gleefully commented, \\"On the internet and in the stratosphere, everybody loves it.\\"Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant (2018), The Once and Future Muse: The Poetry and Poetics of Rhina P. Espaillat University of Pittsburgh Press. Pages 84-85. Espaillat writes poetry in both English and Spanish, and has translated the poetry of Robert Frost and Richard Wilbur into Spanish. Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant (2018), The Once and Future Muse: The Poetry and Poetics of Rhina P. Espaillat, University of Pittsburgh Press. Pages 86-87. Her work has appeared in Poetry, The American Scholar, and many other journals. She is a two-time winner of the Howard Nemerov Sonnet Award, and she judged the 2012 Contest. Her second poetry collection, Where Horizons Go, was published by Truman State University Press in conjunction with her selection for the 1998 T. S. Eliot Prize. Her 2001 collection, Rehearsing Absence, was published by University of Evansville Press after winning the Richard Wilbur Award. Her work has been included in many popular anthologies, including The Heath Introduction to Poetry (Heath 2000); The Muse Strikes Back (Story Line Press 1997); and In Other Words: Literature by Latinas of the U.S. (Arte Publico Press 1994). She is also known for her English translations of the Spanish language poems of St. John of the Cross (1542‚Äì1591), which have appeared in the American journal First Things. Her poetry contains rhythmic sonnets describing family life and domestic settings, called \\"snapshots\\" she also addresses issues of ancestry, assimilation, and immigration. Personal life Of her relationship with sculptor, teacher, and World War II veteran Alfred Moskowitz, Espaillat once said, \\"I met him at the wedding of my best friend, Mimi, and his best friend, Harry. I was still at Hunter College, in my junior year, and we ended up sitting at the same table at the wedding on Thanksgiving Day in 1951. And we started talking, then dancing, and - I know this sounds like madness - he proposed five weeks later on New Year's Eve, and we were married in June of 1952.\\" William Baer (2016), Thirteen on Form: Conversations with Poets, pages 282-283. They remained together until he died in 2016; the couple had three children.

The sexes are similar in appearance; the plumage is mainly dark brown with white spotting, an area of bare skin round the eye, bright red wattles, a bushy crest, a long broad tail and pink legs. It is a social bird, often seen in pairs or small family groups. It feeds in trees, mainly on fruit, and builds a nest of twigs on a branch. The two or three white eggs are incubated by the female.

Distribution The crested guan breeds in lowlands from south Mexico and the Yucat√°n Peninsula to western Ecuador and southern Venezuela at up to altitude. Ecology A crested guan in the wild on Barro Colorado Island, Panama The crested guan is an arboreal forest species. The substantial twig nest is built in a tree or stump and lined with leaves. The female lays two or three large rough-shelled white eggs and incubates them alone. This is a social bird, often seen in pairs or family groups of 6‚Äì12. It walks along branches seeking the fruit and foliage on which it feeds, or flies off with a heavy ani-like flap and glide. The range of this species has severely contracted outside remote or protected forests due to deforestation and hunting, but it has a very wide range and is a relatively common species so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Commonly found in the forest floor near forest edges and gardens on biological stations such as La Selva in Sarapiqui Costa Rica, they are playful and chase each another running around in circles for a good hour or so. Sometimes taking turns among three individuals.

Since its inaugural induction ceremony in 2003, 50 songwriters and individuals and 130 songs have been inducted into the CSHF. History =Founder= Frank Davies founded the CSHF/PACC while he was on the board for the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS). His position was as the first music publisher appointee and as the voice for songwriters and publishers among the group of music industry professionals who oversee Canada's Juno Awards. Frank has had a long career in music, mainly as a record producer and music publisher, recently having received the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award at the 2014 Juno Awards and the Harold Moon Special Achievement Award (SOCAN). He developed the Hall of Fame because he wanted increased public recognition for Canadian Songwriters. =SOCAN= In December 2011, SOCAN ‚Äì the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada acquired the assets of the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame's mandate aligns with SOCAN's objectives as a songwriter and publisher membership-based organization. The CSHF continues to be run as a separate organization with its own board of directors. =Award= Northern Island (1927) The award is a miniature replica of the sculpture 'Northern Island' created by Elizabeth Wyn Wood, who was born in Orillia, Ontario. Wood was a Canadian sculptor, who graduated from the Ontario College of Art (OCA) in 1926. The award was selected by Davies and established in the year 2003. Wood took many trips to the Pickerel River crossing, which is halfway between Parry Sound and Sudbury. She sketched, explored, swam, and feasted in the area she was enchanted by. It was in 1927 that Wood completed the first of the island sculptures which conveyed her true and unique artistic character. Frank Davies Founder's Award The Frank Davies Founder's Award is given to individuals who have dedicated a lifetime to building the Canadian music industry. Recipients receive the Northern Island Award. Legacy Award The Legacy Award is presented to individuals who have contributed significantly to the development, promotion and preservation of Canadian songs and songwriters. Legacy Award inductees receive the Northern Island Award. Mandate The CSHF/PACC's mandate is to honour and celebrate Canadian songwriters and those who have dedicated their lives to the legacy of music, and to educate the public about these achievements. Few people, Canadians included, are aware of the depth of Canada's rich musical heritage and the enormous impact the country's songwriters have had on contemporary music around the world. Canadian songwriters have penned hits for Rod Stewart, Frank Sinatra, The Rolling Stones, Gene Autry, C√©line Dion, Barbra Streisand, Bob Dylan, Madonna, Bing Crosby, Jacques Brel, The Counting Crows, Louis Armstrong and Andr√© Gagnon, to name a few. The revelation of this news is always a source of great pride for Canadians and cause for admiration internationally.  Induction guidelines =Songwriters= Songwriters must be Canadian by birth or citizenship or have landed immigrant status and may be living or dead. Songwriters must have written or co-written the music and/or lyrics to a song or catalogue of songs in one or more of the following categories: * Having entered into popular culture and been sustained through oral tradition for a significant period of time; * Having achieved substantial regional, national and/or international status whether culturally, commercially and/or socially; * Having recorded a historical event or helped to define an era of popular culture; * Having created or helped to create a genre of music. Songwriters must have made a significant contribution through a song or catalogue of songs published, or otherwise made available to the public in some form, for at least twenty-five years. By virtue of their induction to the CSHF, a songwriter inductee's entire catalogue of work is also recognized and inducted into the Hall of Fame. Recognition by era: '' Songwriters and songs shall be recognized by era. All inductees are honoured equally and the eras simply provide a context for induction by allowing the CSHF to honour inductees, annually or otherwise, within a given span of years. The eras are: * Pioneer Era ‚Äì up to 1938 * Radio Era ‚Äì 1939 to 1969 * Modern Era ‚Äì 1970 to twenty-five years prior to the current year) =Songs= An eligible song is a musical work that consists of lyrics and music, or music alone without lyrics, and written wholly or in part by a Canadian (that is, Canadian by birth or citizenship or having landed immigrant status), living or dead, and may qualify in one or more of the following categories: * Having entered into popular culture and been sustained through oral tradition for a significant period of time; * Having achieved substantial regional, national and/or international status whether culturally, commercially and/or socially; * Having recorded a historical event or helped to define an era of popular culture; * Having created or helped to create a genre of music. An eligible song may be an adaptation of an earlier musical work provided the adaptation is itself sufficiently original so as to qualify for copyright protection as a new musical work. A translation is not eligible for song induction independent of the induction of the original musical work. However, if the translated lyrics are not a straight translation of the original lyrics but instead articulate a new and original meaning and sensibility such that the translated lyric is itself a new work capable of copyright protection as an adaptation separate from the original musical work (including a straight translation of that work) then the adapted musical work may qualify for song induction. Songs may have been written by previous songwriter inductees or eligible songwriter inductees and are subject to the same timelines and guidelines regarding eras as apply to the songwriters. =Others= With respect to the induction of those individuals who have contributed significantly to the development and recognition of Canadian songs and songwriters (such as, but not limited to, publishers, performers, broadcasters and other members of the media, collectors and compilers of traditional material, performers of Canadian songs etc.) the board of directors will review any recommendations made to them by the Anglophone and Francophone Induction Committees. These awards are presented at the discretion of the Board of Directors. =Board approvals= In accordance with the CSHF bylaws, the number of inductees, if any, in any given year shall be at the discretion of the board. The board shall also have the option to override guidelines in exceptional circumstances. 2008 inductees =Gala= The CSHF 2008 inductees were announced on 15 November 2007 at Toronto's Le Royal Meridien King Edward. The event was attended by over 150 artists, members of the media and other people in the industry.

History =Early history= W45D began regular broadcasts on May 13, 1941\\"W45D\\" (advertisement), Detroit News, May 13, 1941, page 13. The station began regular operations on the FM dial on May 13, 1941. It originally had the call sign W45D, licensed to the Evening News Association, publishers of The Detroit News. However, the station can trace its origin to an earlier AM \\"ultra-high short-wave\\" station, W8XWJ, which operated as an experimental \\"Apex\\" broadcasting station beginning on January 29, 1936.\\"New Era in Radio Entered as W8XWJ Takes to the Air\\" by George W. Stark, Detroit News, January 30, 1936, pages 1, 4. W8XWJ was shut down in April 1940 in order to prepare for its replacement by the new FM facility,\\"New System For W8XWJ\\", Detroit News, April 14, 1940 page 14. which inherited the earlier station's studios and offices in the Penobscot Building, as well as its transmitter site atop the building.Reflecting the close link between W8XWJ and W45D, beginning on March 17, 1941 a line in the masthead of the Detroit News was changed from \\"W8XWJ Established Jan. 29, 1936\\" to \\"High frequency service (now W45D) established Jan. 29, 1936\\". On October 31, 1940 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) awarded the first fifteen commercial FM station construction permits, including an assignment on 44.5 MHz in Detroit to the Evening News Association,\\"New FM Call Letters Proposed\\", Broadcasting, November 15, 1940, page 77. which was issued the call sign W45D. Although the newspaper wanted to get the station on the air as soon as possible, it was forced to delay the debut after the FCC began an investigation as to whether newspaper ownership of radio stations should be restricted.\\"FCC Starts Newspaper Ownership Drive\\", Broadcasting, March 24, 1941, page 7. On May 6, 1941 the News was one of three newspapers given provisional permission, pending the outcome of the newspaper ownership review, to begin station operations.\\"Three Newspapers Get FM Stations\\", Broadcasting, May 12, 1941, page 26. Following a short period of equipment tests, W45D began broadcasting on a regular schedule as Michigan's first FM station on May 13, 1941, when it launched a limited service of eight hours a day from noon to 8:00 p.m.\\"FM Station Is on the Air\\", Detroit News, May 13, 1941, page 1. An \\"informal dedication\\" program was broadcast six days later.\\"Dedication of W45D Set\\", Detroit News, May 18, 1941, General News section, page 3. Effective November 1, 1943, the FCC modified its policy for FM call signs,\\"Standard Broadcast Station Call Letters for All Outlets Starting Nov. 1, FCC Rule\\", The Billboard, September 4, 1943, page 7. and the station call letters were changed to WENA. After the FCC created the new 88-108 MHz FM broadcast band, WENA was moved to 96.9 in September 1945. In 1947, the station settled on its present 97.1 assignment, and the call letters were changed to WWJ-FM, with programming originally simulcasting WWJ. By the end of the 1960s WWJ-FM had separated programming and begun airing a beautiful music format with programming coming from Schulke Radio Productions (SRP), with which it enjoyed high ratings despite a glut of easy-listening competition in the market from stations such as 95.5 WLDM, 96.3 WJR-FM, 100.3 WNIC and 104.3 WOMC. In addition, during the 1970s WWJ-AM simulcast WWJ-FM's programming during overnight hours. =Joy 97= In November 1981, WWJ-FM changed its call letters to WJOI, which helped it distinguish itself more from its AM all-news sister station. WJOI's format remained beautiful music, although the station changed syndicators from the \\"FM 100 Plan\\" (distributed by Chicago's successful beautiful music station WLOO) to the Bonneville and later Schulke packages. WJR-FM's change to \\"Hot Hits\\" WHYT in September 1982 left WJOI (nicknamed \\"Joy 97\\") as Detroit's only beautiful music station. As a result, WJOI enjoyed consistent top ten or top five showings in the Arbitron ratings through most of the rest of the 1980s, and even reached #1 12+ in the Arbitron results in the spring 1984 book (1), topping WJR, at a time when the beautiful music format had nearly disappeared in other markets. Listenership eroded slightly in the late 1980s with the success of former Top-40 giant CKLW-AM's \\"Music of Your Life\\" format but Joy 97 remained a consistent top performer in the ratings. However, most of the station's listeners were older than the demographics usually courted by advertisers. Thus, in early 1991, the station made some adjustments to its format, dropping the syndication and going to a staff of live announcers and at the same time adding more soft pop and mellow rock vocals to the mix while replacing many of the traditional orchestra-based instrumentals with new-age and smooth jazz cuts. The \\"freshening up\\" of the format, however, did not reverse the station's fortunes, and ratings steadily declined. By early 1994, the station was essentially a mostly-vocal soft adult contemporary format. The WJOI call sign is now in use at an AM adult standards music station in Norfolk, Virginia. CBS Radio bought WJOI and WWJ-AM from Federal Broadcasting in 1989.\\"CBS Celebrates Christmas With $55 Million Motor City Combo\\", Radio & Records, December 23, 1988, page 9. =Star 97= With the soft AC approach failing to make the station a contender against WNIC and WLTI, WJOI became WYST (aka \\"Star 97\\") on September 2, 1994, and featured a 1970s oldies/classic hits format.\\"WJOI Dodges 'Arrow' in '70s Switch\\", Radio & Records, September 9, 1994, pages 3, 22. WYST positioned itself as \\"The Greatest Hits of the '70s,\\" although the station did branch its playlist out somewhat into the late '60s and early '80s. WYST was also Detroit's outlet for syndicated morning show host Don Imus. =97-1 K-Rock/Live 97-1 Free FM= On February 3, 1997, Imus' show moved to AM sister WXYT 1270, making room for The Howard Stern Show. WYST switched its format to Active Rock, as \\"97ROCK\\" (later taking the call letters WKRK and the on-air identifier \\"97-1 K-Rock\\" in June of that year).\\"Motor City Moves: WYST Flips To Rock With Stern In Mornings; Imus On 'XYT\\", Radio & Records, February 7, 1997, page 3. Competing with WRIF (Detroit's other active rock station), \\"K-Rock\\" caught the ears of fans of harder rock and metal. However, K-Rock's penchant for making fun of WRIF, mostly for long stretches between songs, turned off many a listener just as quickly. Ratings continued to be less than impressive, and on August 31, 1998, WKRK repositioned itself as \\"Extreme Radio\\" with its format evolving toward Hot Talk.\\"Rumbles, Pt. 1\\", Radio & Records, September 4, 1998, page 25. By March 1999, the majority of the station's music programming on weekdays was gone and the station soon took on the name \\"97-1: Detroit's FM Talk Station\\". This was later changed to simply \\"97.1 FM Talk\\". During this period it carried syndicated talk shows such as Loveline, The Tom Leykis Show, and Mancow's Morning Madhouse, as well as local shows. WKRK relaunched as \\"Live 97.1\\" in May 2003. In August 2004, WKRK became the flagship radio station for the Detroit Lions. In October 2005, WKRK added the \\"Free FM\\" identifier being used by CBS Radio on many of its hot-talk properties across the country. Once Howard Stern left for Sirius Satellite Radio on January 3, 2006, WKRK began airing Rover's Morning Glory in morning drive. Rover continued as the morning show until September 2006, when low ratings led to a switch to the syndicated Opie and Anthony. =Detroit's Sports Powerhouse/97-1 The Ticket= On October 1, 2007, at 3 PM, WKRK ended its eight-year run as a hot talk station, and flipped to an all-sports format, simulcasting with 1270 WXYT, and changing its call letters to WXYT-FM, with the simulcast being named \\"97-1 FM & 1270 AM: Detroit's Sports Powerhouse\\". Of its \\"Free FM\\" lineup, Deminski & Doyle were moved to mornings, and Bill McAllister remained. On November 6, 2007, the simulcast was renamed \\"97-1 FM The Ticket.\\" The 1270 AM frequency was then only mentioned at the top of the hour. Another change was the names of the midday show \\"The Big Show\\" and afternoon show \\"The Sports Inferno\\". Both of the shows names were dropped, with both being renamed to \\"Karsch & Anderson\\", and \\"Valenti & Foster\\", respectively. A few months later, after Deminski & Doyle left for WCSX, current morning show \\"Motor City Mornings\\" was renamed \\"Jay Towers & Bill McAllister Mornings\\". This was all done to \\"promote the personalities.\\" Jay Towers left WXYT in December 2009, and the show then renamed \\"The Morning Show\\" with Bill, Sara and Mike \\"Stoney\\" Stone filling in. In November 2010, the morning show was renamed \\"Stoney & Bill\\". On February 5, 2009, WXYT acquired the rights to become the Detroit Pistons flagship station starting in the 2009-2010 season. WWJ 950 AM covered Pistons games when they conflicted with The Ticket's coverage of Lions, Tigers, or Red Wings games. 1270 AM also provided, and continues to provide, coverage of Tigers or Red Wings game in case of conflicting schedules. In January 2013, the station added longtime WDFN personalities Jamie Samuelsen and Bob Wojnowski, for the early evening shift (6pm-8pm). On November 20, 2015, it was announced that the Detroit Lions would move to WJR beginning in the 2016 NFL season, ending the team's 20-year relationship with CBS Radio. Officials stated that CBS had dropped the Lions over demands that it censor on-air content that was critical of the team. In particular, the Lions specifically demanded that the station fire popular on-air personality Mike Valenti as a condition of any extension to its broadcast rights, which the station refused to do; Valenti has had a history of making remarks critical of the Lions and their poor performance. In September 2016, McAllister left the morning show and was replaced by Jamie Samuelsen. Kyle Bogie replaced Samuelsen for the evening show alongside Wojo. Weeks later, Terry Foster retired from afternoon drive co-hosting duties with Mike Valenti after a brief return. Valenti continues to host afternoons solo. After three seasons on WMGC-FM, Detroit Pistons basketball returned to WXYT beginning with the 2017-18 season.http://www.talkers.com May 25, 2017 On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.

The dam impounds the Gomal River, a tributary of the Indus River, at Khjori Kach, where the Gomal River passes through a narrow ravine. The purpose of the dam is irrigation, flood control and hydroelectric power generation. Construction of the dam began in August 2001 and was completed in April 2011. The powerhouse was completed in March 2013 and electricity production started in August 2013. The dam was officially inaugurated on 12 September 2013 by Minister for Water and Power Khawaja Muhammad Asif, along with the US Ambassador Richard G. Olson and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shaukatullah Khan. Features Gomal Dam is a roller-compacted concrete (RCC) gravity dam with a height of 437 feet (133 m). It has a gross storage capacity of and the 60.5 km long main canal will irrigate about barren land of Tank district and Tehsil Kulachi of Dera Ismail Khan. It produces 17.4 MW of electricity. Background The dam site at Khjori was first envisaged by four British officers of the Royal Corps of Engineers in 1898 and surveys were carried out. The Government of Pakistan approved the construction of the dam in August 1963 and preparatory work was commenced. However, it was stopped due to the outbreak of the 1965 Indo-Pak War and by subsequent budgetary constraints. However, in 2001, the local Provincial Minister Aminullah Gandapur brought the delay in the construction of the dam to the notice of the then President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, who ordered its construction. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 14 August 2001.Daily Nation, Lahore 28 Aug 2001 Finances and construction In 2002, Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) hired a Chinese joint venture, CWHEC-HPE, to lead construction at a cost of about Rs. 4.388 billion. The venture joined China National Water Resources & Hydropower Engineering Corporation and Harbin Power Engineering Company. Work halted in October 2004 when two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan militants. One was later rescued but the other killed in the attempt. Work resumed in 2007, after Pakistan put its army's construction branch, the Frontier Works Organisation, in charge. It hired as sub-contractors China's state-owned Sinohydro Corporation to complete the dam, and Turkey's Tekser to finish irrigation works. The total cost of the resumed project was stated to be around Rs. 13 billion. In July 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) announced it would provide funding for the dam. Further delay to the project was caused by the 2010 Pakistan floods. In October 2010, the construction work on the dam was reported to be 92 percent complete. It was also stated to start operating from April 2011. In January 2011, USAID signed an agreement with WAPDA to provide $40 million to help complete the under-construction Gomal Zam Dam & powerhouse. The first tranche of $20 million was released to WAPDA in February 2011. Another $20 million were provided to complete the main dam and the powerhouse. Construction of the Dam was completed in April 2011 and filling of the reservoir was started in the same month. Eight more dam workers were kidnapped by Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan militants on 15 August 2012. Seven of the eight workers were released on 14 September 2013 after the Pakistani government paid a heavy ransom of Rs. 25 million to the ‚Äòcommander Latif‚Äô group of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. The fate of the eighth kidnapped employee is unknown. Another $40 million are also being provided by the USAID for completion of the irrigation and flood protection component of the project. In January 2013, the irrigation and flood protection component was stated to be \\"almost near completion\\". The powerhouse was completed in March 2013 and the electricity production started in August 2013. The Gomal Zam Dam was officially inaugurated on 12 September 2013. =Waran Canal System= On 12 September 2012, WAPDA and USAID signed an agreement for the construction of Waran Canal System in Tank district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Under the agreement, USAID will provide $12 million funding for construction of the 164 km long Waran Canal system to bring 28,000 acres barren land under permanent irrigation. In January 2013, WAPDA started the construction of Waran Canal system as an integral component of Gomal Zam Dam project. On completion, the canal will irrigate 28,000 acres land in the district which would increase crop sowing in the area from 26 percent to 87 percent and harvesting intensity from 9 percent to 80 percent. The Waran Canal, in addition to Gomal Zam Dam's main canal, will bring a total of 191,000 acres land under permanent irrigation in Dera Ismail Khan & Tank districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It is very unfortunate that till date the irrigation channel has not yet started working. Due to the high level of negligence on the part of concern authorities the canal is yet to start. Since 2012 till 2019 it's almost 7 years that the canal is delayed on various reasons. The land that is to be irrigated by War an canal is fertile enough not to cater only the need of food of the local area rather will contribute to the national exchequer. District tank is one of the most backward districts of KP and even the people have an acute problem of clean drinking water, and the operationalization of the waran canal indirectly contribute to the need of safe drinking water by rising the under ground water table. All concerns and especially the minister for water and power and the PM are requested to give special attention to waran canal and ensure its earlier operation .

It was enacted to replace the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 (RRA). The Act was and remains very controversial, because of a perception that it is an Enabling Act substantially removing the ancient British constitutional restriction on the Executive introducing and altering laws without assent or scrutiny by Parliament, and it has been called the \\"Abolition of Parliament Act\\".How I woke up to a nightmare plot to steal centuries of law and liberty, The Times, 15 February 2006.Who wants the Abolition of Parliament Bill?, The Times, 21 February 2006. The Bill for this Act The bill which became the Act was brought before the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in early 2006. As originally drafted, the Bill was controversial, as it would have granted government ministers wide powers to make secondary legislation that could amend, repeal or replace any primary legislation or secondary legislation (known as a Henry VIII clause). The government proposed numerous amendments to the Bill on 4 May 2006 and 10 May 2006, to address certain criticisms of the Bill's scope and lack of safeguards. The Bill received its third reading in the House of Commons on 16 May 2006, and moved to the House of Lords. After its first and second readings, the bill was reported with amendments on 19 July 2006, before the summer recess. Its report stage in the House of Lords took place on 26 October 2006, and it received royal assent on 8 November 2006. =Part 1: Power to reform legislation= The first Part of the Bill, entitled \\"Power to reform legislation\\", permits a government minister to make Statutory Instruments to reform legislation that is perceived to be \\"outdated, unnecessary or over- complicated\\".New Bill to enable delivery of swift and efficient regulatory reform to cut red tape - Jim Murphy , Cabinet Office press release, CAB/001/06, 11 January 2006. A similar procedure is possible under the existing RRA, which permits a minister to make Regulatory Reform Orders (RROs). A review of the first 4 years of operation of the RRA, published by the Cabinet Office in July 2005, concluded that the RRA \\"presented a number of hurdles which inhibited the production of RROs\\", its powers were \\"too technical and limited\\", and the procedure should be \\"extended to deliver non- controversial proposals for simplification\\".Explanatory notes, paragraph 5. Under clause 1 of the Bill, a minister can only make an order for two purposes: \\"reforming legislation\\" or \\"implementing recommendations\\" made by the Law Commission, the Scottish Law Commission or the Northern Ireland Law Commission, with or without changes. Part of the justification for the Bill is that reports of the Law Commissions are often not acted upon for years after they are published. Under clause 2, an order may amend, repeal or replace any primary or secondary legislation. Before making an order, clause 3 of the Bill requires the relevant minister to be satisfied that a legislative change is required to secure the policy objective, that the proposed order is \\"proportionate\\", \\"strikes a fair balance\\" between the public interest and the interests of any persons adversely affected, does not remove any \\"necessary protection\\", and does not prevent anyone from exercising rights or freedoms that they \\"might reasonably expect to continue to exercise\\". The Bill contains some express limitations. Clause 5 prevents the Bill being used to \\"impose or increase taxation\\"; clause 6 prevents orders under the Bill being used to create any new criminal offence that is punishable by imprisonment for more than 2 years; and clause 7 prevents the Bill being used to authorise any forcible entry, search or seizure, or compel the giving of evidence (subject to exceptions where merely restating existing legislation, or implementing the recommendations of a Law Commission). Clause 8 prevents orders being made in relation to matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, and Clause 9 prevents orders being made to alter the functions of the Welsh Assembly without its prior consent. Ministers are required to consult widely before making an order under the Bill, lay a draft of a proposed order before Parliament with an explanatory documents. The draft order may pass through Parliament to become a Statutory Instrument under the existing \\"negative resolution\\" or \\"affirmative resolution\\" procedures, or a new \\"super-affirmative resolution\\" procedure. Criticism Controversially, the order-making powers in the Bill are potentially very wide. Although, for example, the Bill (if it is enacted as drafted) cannot be used to introduce new taxes, there is no restriction on the Bill being used to amend itself; and the tests that a minister must satisfy before making an order are very subjective. An order would be subject to supervision by the High Court by way of judicial review, but it would be difficult to show that a minister was not \\"satisfied\\" that the requirements for making an order were met. In January 2006, the Bill was called \\"potentially one of the most constitutionally significant Bills that has come before the House for some time\\" by the House of Commons Select Committee on Regulatory Reform;Select Committee on Regulatory Reform - First Special Report, HC 878, 31 January 2006. while supporting the move to cut \\"red tape\\", the Committee asked for extra safeguards to avoid potential \\"abuse\\" of the powers in the Bill.Red tape law 'must not be abused', BBC News, 6 February 2006. Earlier in January, the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution wrote to the Lord Chancellor to express its concern that the Bill could markedly alter the respective and long-established roles of Ministers and Parliament in the legislative process, and its disappointment that the bill had not been published in draft.Letter from the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution to the Lord Chancellor, 23 January 2006 (MS Word); also published in Appendix 1 to the House of Lords Constitution Select Committee Eleventh Report, HL 194, 24 May 2006, together with a reply from the Lord Chancellor. The Bill has been criticised heavily in articles and correspondence published in the press. In The Times, journalist Daniel Finkelstein dubbed it the \\"Bill to End All Bills\\", and Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament David Howarth called it the \\"Abolition of Parliament Bill\\". The Green Party passed a motion at their conference against the Bill, saying \\"the Bill threatens to shatter the foundations of democracy\\". The Bill has also been criticised by legal professionals. The Law Society published a briefing note before its Second Reading, expressing concerns that safeguards were too weak, that secondary legislation should not be able to authorise further subordinate legislation, that the powers of non-Ministers acting under delegated powers were not restricted, and that there was no procedure for Parliament to challenge use of the Bill.Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, House of Commons - Second Reading, Law Society, 9 February 2006. In a letter published in The Times, six professors of law at the University of Cambridge wrote that the Bill could be used to create a new offence of incitement to religious hatred, punishable by two years' imprisonment; curtail or abolish trial by jury; introduce house arrest; allow the Prime Minister to sack judges; rewrite the law on nationality and immigration; and \\"reform\\" Magna Carta, saying that \\"It would, in short, create a major shift of powers within the State, which in other countries would require an amendment to the constitution; and one in which the winner would be the executive, and the loser Parliament.\\"Letters to the Editor, The Times, 16 February 2006. Joshua Rozenberg wrote in The Telegraph that Clifford Chance had pointed out that the Bill \\"usurps the power of Parliament\\",Three more reasons to be depressed, The Telegraph, 9 February 2006. and David Pannick QC wrote in The Times that the Bill \\"would confer astonishingly broad powers on ministers to make the law of the land\\".Another blow to Parliament?, The Times, 28 February 2006. Barristers Sir Jeremy Lever QC and George Peretz pointed out in a letter to The Times on 23 February 2006 that the Solicitor General told Parliament on 13 July 1972 that the similar powers in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 would only be used for \\"consequential amendments of a small, minor and insignificant kind\\", although they have been used subsequently to implement EC legislation that has made substantial changes to UK law.Letters to the Editor, The Times, 23 February 2006. An article in The Guardian compared the Bill to the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, saying that the Bill was presented as modernising measure but actually gave ministers arbitrary powers, taking \\"another chunk out of our centuries-old democracy\\".How we move ever closer to becoming a totalitarian state, The Guardian, 5 March 2006. An article published in The Independent in June 2006 that analysed the last nine years of legal reform attacked the Prime Minister and his Government, claiming that the numerous changes and laws passed since it has been in power have reduced the power of democracy in the UK; the Bill was one example the journalist gave of the kinds of methods being employed to do this.Blair Laid Bare: the article that may get you (arrested for reading) . After the Bill completed its committee stage in the House of Commons, it was reported that the House of Commons Procedure Committee had complained that the Bill \\"tips the balance between the executive and Parliament too far in the Government's favour\\". MPs angry at Bill to end all Bills, The Telegraph, 18 March 2006. A second report published by the House of Commons Select Committee on Public Administration on 20 April 2006 stated that, \\"As currently drafted, the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill gives the Government powers which are entirely disproportionate to its stated aims.\\"Public Administration - Third Report - Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, HC 1033, 20 April 2006. In May 2006, the House of Lords Constitution Select Committee published a report which drew attention to a number of issues. The report criticised the manner in which the bill was introduced, commenting that the consultative process was \\"lamentable\\", that the bill was not debated on the floor of the House of Commons, as is long accepted practice for bills of first class constitutional importance, and that the late amendments, while welcome, were \\"something of an indictment of the processes of policy-making and legislation\\". The report also noted a repetition of the delegation of \\"unprecedentedly wide power\\" to ministers, as the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 was described in December 2000; and the further ability for ministers to change legislation to implement recommendations of the Law Commission. The report concluded that the bill, after amendment, was more balanced than before, but remained \\"over-broad and vaguely drawn\\", and further safeguards were necessary.Constitution - Eleventh Report - Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, HL 194, 24 May 2006. Support The government minister responsible, Jim Murphy, said, in winding up the debate on Second Reading on 9 February 2006: \\"I give the House clear undertakings, which I shall repeat in Committee, that the orders will not be used to implement highly controversial reforms\\",Winding up the debate on second reading, Hansard, Col.1101, 9 February 2006. although there is no such restriction in the text of the Bill itself. Barrister Francis Bennion (formerly Parliamentary Counsel, and author of the authoritative Bennion on Statutory Interpretation) wrote in a letter to The Times on 20 February 2006 that \\"The Bill opens the door to much-needed reforms in what is called lawyer's law\\".Letters to the Editor: Time to Reform, The Times, 20 February 2006 In May 2006, a report from the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform found that clause 1 of the bill was \\"not far different\\" from the power granted under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, and so not inappropriate. While recognising the need for sub-delegation of order-making powers in some situations, the report considered that the case for unlimited sub-delegation was sufficiently made out, and that some limits should be imposed, for example, by specifying categories of person (such as local authorities) to whom powers could be delegated. The report found that the powers of Parliamentary supervision in the amended bill were adequate, but the ability for a minister to change the law to implement recommendations of Law Commission or to consolidate and simplify legislation were thought to be inappropriate, saying that \\"the statute law should be made by Parliament, not by Ministers\\".Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform - Twentieth Report - Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, HL 192, 24 May 2006. =Part 2: Regulators= The second Part of the Bill, entitled \\"Regulators\\", implements recommendations of a review led by Philip Hampton, entitled \\"Reducing administrative burdens: effective inspection and enforcement\\", published in the Hampton Report in a March 2005. Clause 19 contains two principles that regulators must have regard to when exercising particular regulatory functions: regulatory activities must be carried out in a way which is \\"transparent, accountable, proportionate and consistent\\", and should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed. Clause 20 and enables a minister to introduce a mandatory Code of Practice for regulators. =Part 3: European Community legislation= The third Part of the Bill, entitled \\"Legislation Relating to the European Communities etc.\\", makes provision about legislation relating to the European Communities, to reduce the number of UK Statutory Instruments required to transpose EU legislation into domestic UK law. These provisions were copied from the European Union Bill which was also before Parliament, but which had made little progress. =Procedural history= House of Commons The Bill was introduced in the House of Commons by Jim Murphy, Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office, on 11 January 2006, becoming Bill 111 of the 2005/6 Parliamentary session.First reading, Hansard, Col.305, 11 January 2006. A Bill of this nature would usually be introduced by a more senior minister, such as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster or the Cabinet Office Minister, but a replacement for John Hutton had not been announced in over two months since he was promoted to replace David Blunkett as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on 2 November 2005. Hilary Armstrong became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Cabinet reshuffle on 5 May 2005.

A number of government amendments were agreed, but none of the amendments proposed by the opposition parties were passed.

The amendments make substantial changes to the Bill, replacing the first two clauses entirely with new clauses under which an order can only be made for the purposes of \\"removing or reducing any burden\\" from legislation, or of securing that regulatory activities are \\"carried out in a way which is transparent,accountable, proportionate and consistent\\" and are \\"targeted only at cases in which action is needed\\", or of implementing the recommendations of a Law Commission. The amendments also add a power for a Committee of either of the Houses of Parliament to prevent a draft order being passed, subject to the Committee being overruled by the relevant House. Further \\"follow-up\\" amendments were published on 10 May 2006 to \\"ensure total clarity on what this Bill is intended to deliver\\".Government amends Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill , Cabinet Office press statement, 10 May 2006. Amongst other things, the new amendments ensure that the Orders under the Bill could not be used to amend the Bill itself, once it is enacted, nor to amend the Human Rights Act 1998.

It marked the centre of the new city, and was a central point along the Mese, the main ceremonial road through the city. It was circular and had two monumental gates to the east and west. The Column of Constantine, which still stands upright and is known today in Turkish as √áemberlita≈ü, was erected in the centre of the square. The column was originally crowned with a statue of Constantine I (3. 306-337) as Apollo, but a strong gale in 1150 caused the statue and three of the column's upper drums to fall, and a cross was added in its place by the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143-1180). Otherwise the forum remained nearly intact until the Fourth Crusade in 1203-1204. The city's first Senate House lay on the north side of it. We know from the sources that the square was decorated with a number of antique statues, but it is impossible to determine their exact appearance and location. The Forum suffered major damage in a fire started by soldiers of the Fourth Crusade in 1203. After the Sack of 1204, the antique statues decorating the Forum were melted down by the Crusaders.

The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services), where each call is an expensive operation. Because the majority of the cost of each call is related to the round-trip time between the client and the server, one way of reducing the number of calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data that would have been transferred by the several calls, but that is served by one call only. The difference between data transfer objects and business objects or data access objects is that a DTO does not have any behavior except for storage, retrieval, serialization and deserialization of its own data (mutators, accessors, parsers and serializers). In other words, DTOs are simple objects that should not contain any business logic but may contain serialization and deserialization mechanisms for transferring data over the wire. This pattern is often incorrectly used outside of remote interfaces. This has triggered a response from its authorLocalDTO.

Procurement ended with the war, though remaining stocks were issued to troops after the war, as well as distributed as surplus in civilian feeding programs overseas. The 5-in-1 specification remained in effect after the war, and was again used in 1948 for a new field ration. Development, adoption, and use The 5-in-1 was developed in 1942 by the Subsistence Research Laboratory (SRL) of the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps to fulfill a need for a pre-packaged field ration for use by small motorized combat groups. The 5-in-1 allowed small groups of soldiers or large groups divided into multiple units to cook meals without the need of complex kitchen utensils or cooking skill. Another objective was to furnish sufficient food to take care of five men for one day. The U.S. Quartermaster Corps' Subsistence Branch originally planned for the rations to be used by troops without immediate kitchen facilities, such as trains without kitchen cars, motorized infantry, armored vehicle crews, or gun crews.Koehler, Franz A., Special Rations for the Armed Forces: Army Operational Rations - A Historical Background, QMC Historical Studies, Historical Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington, D.C. (1958) Unlike the Mountain ration or Jungle ration, the 5-in-1 was a ration developed solely by the SRL. The 5-in-1's components were packed as a group, with noncanned components placed in a separate carton overpacked in a larger carton with the canned products. Menus were enclosed in the carton as a guide in the selection of meals. By mid-1943, the ration was the most successful field ration in use in North Africa. In that same year, the 10-in-1 ration was developed to replace it, as it offered a wider menu and greater flexibility in small unit issue. Extensive procurement of the 5-in-1 ended the same year. However, use of 5-in-1 stocks continued throughout the war, and the ration was still in distribution when hostilities ended. Though procurement of the 5-in-1 had ended with the war, the specification remained in effect and later became the basis for a postwar revision in 1948, under which the 5-in-1 nomenclature was reestablished.

Of its length is in India, on the Indo‚ÄìBangladesh border and the rest is in Bangladesh. The upper part of its navigable part is in India -- between Lakhipur and Bhanga, declared as National Waterway 6, (NW-6) since the year 2016. It drains a basin of , of which lies in India, 1.38% (rounded) of the country. The water and banks host or are visited by a wide variety of flora and fauna. The principal tributaries are all in India: the Sonai (or Tuirial), the Jiri, the Tlawng (or Dhaleswari, or Katakal), the Jatinga, the Longai and the Madhura. Tipaimukh Dam is a proposed dam on the river itself. Sources From its source at Liyai Kullen Village in Manipur state where most people are of the Poumai Naga tribe, the river is known as Vourei. Near its source, the river receives streams such as the Vehrei originating from Phuba Village, the Gumti, Howrah, Kagni, Senai Buri, Hari Mangal, Kakrai, Kurulia, Balujhuri, Shonaichhari and Durduria. It flows west in Manipur, and borders Nagaland, then southwest to Assam where it leaves India and enters Bangladesh at Bhanga Bazar. Barak River in Lakhipur, Assam Main tributaries In Manipur, in its flow south-west to Tipaimukh, it is joined by the Tuivai, and then flows northward to Jirimukh where it is joined by the Jiri river from the north. From here the flow is westward into Cachar, then Karimganj District of Assam, then to Sylhet in Bangladesh having a co-distributary the Surma River, the other later becoming the Meghna before the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta. The Padma joins it to become the Meghna.  Wildlife  The Barak is among the richest rivers in the world as to aquatic biodiversity, as it contains more than 2,000 species of fish. Other creatures include River Barak or Siamese crocodile (a rare and endangered crocodilian), the susu dolphin, smooth-coated otter and black mugger crocodile. From its origin to its bifurcation at the border of Nagaland producing the Surma River the Barak is long. The biomes are extremely rich in wildlife and also very diverse in the entire stretch of the river including: #Varzea forest (flooded rainforest) #Los llamjao (flooded grassland and Savannah) #Tidal forest (mangroves in vast Delta Avourei) #Flora or vegetation of the Pats (flat-topped table mountains in India and western Cambodia) #Very large tropical swamps.  Environmental concerns  Environmentalists have expressed concern over the way aquatic creatures and their habitats are being destroyed in the upper reaches of river in southern Assam. Prominent nature conservation NGO Society for Activists for Forest and Environment (SAFE) has pointed out that the tribals living on both banks of Barak have developed the harmful practice of blasting small gelatin sticks smuggled from Mizoram to kill fish. In the process, thousands of fish, young and mature, along with turtles, dolphins and other aquatic life organisms are killed. The Ganges river dolphin is endangered. The proposed Tipaimukh Dam on the river in northeast India - a political controversy between India and Bangladesh - could hasten its extinction, researchers warn. Making a plea for conservation, researchers from Assam state in a study that the dolphin, India‚Äôs national aquatic animal is heading towards ‚Äúlocal extinction‚Äù in the river system of the state. ‚ÄúFactors like poaching (for oil and meat) and accidental mortalities in fishing gear, gradual habitat degradation by sluice gates, embankments, disturbances like motorboats and aquatic pollution have resulted in the extirpation of the resident dolphin population from the Barak river system of Assam,‚Äù M.K.

The archipelago has approximately of coast and its highest hill, Chameau (\\"Camel\\"), reaches about . =Islands= It is composed of two very mountainous inhabited islands, Terre-de-Haut Island and Terre-de-Bas Island. Grand-√élet is an uninhabited protected area. There are six other uninhabited √Æslets. Les Roches Perc√©es An uninhabited island characterized by high rocks abrupt which the erosion dug impressive fractures by which the sea rushes. These faults are at the origin of the naming of the island. It is a natural site classified by French law. The entry and the anchorage of motorboats, as well as sailing boats are strictly forbidden. √élet √† Cabrit At at the northwest of Terre-de-Haut Island, closing partially the Bay of les Saintes.

It spreads out in the length from the southeast headland to the northwest headland and is characterized by a coast of abrupt cliffs towards Dominica Passage and a sandy hillside opening on Terre-de-Haut Island. Les Augustins A small group of rocks near la Coche from which they are separated by the Passe des Souffleurs. They are separated from Terre-de-Bas Island by the Southwest Passage, a major shipping lane. The Rocher de la Vierge, is named for the Immaculate Conception. Le P√¢t√© An island in shape of a high plateau at of the northern headland of Terre-de-Bas Island, called Pointe √† Vache.

Les Saintes is a territory of the northern hemisphere situated in North America, in the Caribbean islands, between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator. It is positioned at 15¬∞51' North, the same latitude as Thailand or Honduras, and at 61¬∞36' West, the same longitude as Labrador and the Falkland Islands. This locality places the archipelago at from metropolitan France; at from the southeast of Florida, at from the coast of South America, and exactly at the heart of the arc of the Lesser Antilles. Les Saintes lies immediately south of the island of Guadeloupe and west of Marie-Galante. It is separated from Guadeloupe by Les Saintes Passage and from the north of Dominica by the Dominica Passage. * 20px Africa, at * 20px Central America, at * 20px France, at * 20px Venezuela, at * 20px New York, at * 20px Rio de Janeiro, at * 20px Barbados, at * 20px Puerto Rico, at * 20px Guadeloupe, at * 20px Dominica, at  Education  There are six primary and secondary schools which welcome the pupils of both municipalities. There are two nursery schools, two primary schools, and two middle schools (colleges). High school and higher education requires the children to go to Guadeloupe, Martinique or France.  Demographics  The inhospitable relief and the low precipitation do not allow the establishment of agriculture. Few slaves were brought onto these islands. The population is constituted historically by Bretons, Normans and Poitevins who settled on the islands to fish, rather than establish plantation slavery, as elsewhere in the Caribbean. This explains the largely European origin of the Saintois , as islanders are called. In 2017, the population of les Saintes was established as: Terre-de-Haut: 1,532 inhabitants, with a density of population of 255 inhabitants / km2. The number of households is 676. Terre-de-Bas: 1,046 inhabitants, with a density of population of 154 inhabitants / km2. The number of households is 429. The life expectancy is 75 years for men and to 82 years for women. The average number of children per woman is 2.32.  History  =Pre-Columbian= Les Saintes, due to their location in the heart of the Lesser Antilles, were frequented first by Indian tribes coming from Caribbean and Central America. Caarouca√´ra (the Arawak name of √éles des Saintes), although uninhabited due to the lack of spring water, were regularly visited by Arawak peoples then Kalinagos living on the neighbourhood islands of Guadeloupe and Dominica around the 9th century. They went there to practise hunting and fishing. The archaeological remains of war axes and pottery dug up on the site of Anse Rodrigue's Beach and stored at \\"Fort Napol√©on\\" museum testify the visits of these populations. =Discovery and colonisation= It was during his second expedition for America, that Christopher Columbus discovered the small archipelago, on 4 November 1493. He named them \\"Los Santos\\", in reference to All Saints' Day which had just been celebrated. Around 1523, along with its neighbours, these islands, which were devoid of precious metals, were abandoned by the Spanish who favoured the Greater Antilles and the South American continent. On 18 October 1648, a French expedition led by Sir du M√©, annexed les Saintes, already under English influence, at the request of the governor of Guadeloupe, Charles Hou√´l. From 1649, the islands became a colony exploited by the French West India Company which tried to establish agriculture. However, the inhospitable ground and the aridity of \\"Terre-de-Haut\\" halted this activity, though it persisted for a while on Terre-de-Bas, which was wetter and more fertile, under the orders of Sir Hazier du Buisson from 1652. In 1653, the Kalinagos slaughtered the French troops in Marie-Galante. Sir du M√© decided to respond to this attack by sending a punitive expedition against the tribes in Dominica. Following these events, the Kalinagos, invaded les Saintes to take revenge. Sir Comte de l'Etoile tried to repel the Caribs who were definitively chased away in 1658. In the name of the King of France, les Saintes were acquired in the royal domain by Jean-Baptiste Colbert when the French West India Company was dissolved in 1664. On 4 August 1666, while the English were attacking the archipelago, their fleet was routed by the passage of a hurricane and some British who besieged this \\"Gibraltar of the Antilles\\" were quickly expelled by the troops of Sir du Lion and Sir Desmeuriers, helped by the Caribs. The English surrendered on 15 August 1666, the day of the Assumption of Mary, and a Te Deum was intoned at the request of Sir du Lion who founded an annual remembrance in honour to this victory - this is celebrated ardently on the island of Terre-de-Haut to this day. Our-Lady-of-Assumption became the Patron saint of the parish. To protect the French colonies of the area, the English were repelled to Barbados by the governor of Santo Domingo, Jean-Baptiste Ducasse in 1691. From 1759 to 1763, the British took possession of Les Saintes and a part of Guadeloupe. Les Saintes were restored to the Kingdom of France only after the signature of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763, by which France gave up √éle Royale, Isle Saint-Jean, Acadia and Canada, the Great Lakes region and the left bank of the Mississippi to the British. To prevent further British ambitions, King Louis XVI ordered the construction of fortifications on Les Saintes. Thus began the construction of \\"Fort Louis\\" on the Mire Hill, \\"Fort de la Reine\\" on Petite Martinique island, the watchtowers of \\"Modele tower\\" on Chameau Hill (the top of the archipelago, 309 m), the artillery batteries of Morel Hill and Mouillage Hill, in 1777.D√©p√¥ts des plans et fortifications (D.F.C.) Archives nationales section outre-mer rue Oudinot Paris Battle of Les Saintes, 12 April 1782. On 12 April 1782, after the military campaign of January in Basseterre on the island of Saint Christopher, the French fleet of Comte de Grasse, which aimed to capture British Jamaica, left Martinique and headed towards the archipelago of les Saintes, where it arrived in the evening. Caught in the Dominica Passage by the British and inferior in number, it was engaged and defeated by the ships of the line of George Brydges Rodney aboard the Formidable and Samuel Hood aboard the Barfleur. According to legend, after he had fired the last of the ammunition of his carronades, de Grasse fired off his silverware. In a little more than five hours, 2,000 French sailors and soldiers were killed and wounded, and 5,000 men and 4 ships of the line captured and one ship of the line sunk. The defeat resulted in √éles des Saintes coming under British rule for twenty years. In 1794, France's National Convention, represented by Victor Hugues, tried to reconquer the islands but succeeded in occupying them only temporarily, the islands being recaptured away by the powerful British vessel Queen Charlotte. In 1802, the First French Empire under Napoleon launched a successful operation to recapture the archipelago from the British. On 14 April 1809, the British fleet of Admiral Sir Alexander Forrester Inglis Cochrane reconquered the archipelago. Three young people from les Saintes, Mr. Jean Calo, Mr. Cointre and Mr. Solitaire, succeeded in guiding three French vessels (Hautpoult, Courageux, and F√©licit√©) commanded by the infantry division of Admiral Troude which were caught unawares inside the bay and helped them to escape back to France through the North Passage called \\"La baleine\\". These men were decorated with the Legion of Honour for their actions. Guadeloupe island was also conquered on 26 February 1810 by the British.. The French Governor Jean Augustin Ernouf was forced to capitulate. By a bilateral treaty signed in Stockholm on 3 March 1813, Sweden promised the British that they would make a common front against Napoleon's France. In return, the British would have to support the ambitions of Stockholm on Norway. Pragmatically, Karl XIV Johan indeed understood that it was time for Sweden to abandon Finland (lost in 1809) and to spread the kingdom westward. Besides, Great Britain offered the colony of Guadeloupe to Karl XIV Johan personally to seal this new alliance. Under the Treaty of Paris signed on 30 May 1814, the United Kingdom accepted to give Guadeloupe back to France. King Karl XIV Johan of Sweden retroceded Guadeloupe to France and earned in exchange the recognition of the Union of Sweden and Norway and the payment to the Swedish royal house of 24 million gold francs in compensation (Guadeloupe Fund). However, the French only came back to les Saintes on 5 December, when the General Leith, commander in chief of forces in the West Indies and governor of the Leeward Isles accepted it. The new governor of Guadeloupe and dependencies, the Commodore Sir Comte de Linois and his deputy governor Sir Eug√®ne-√âdouard Boyer, Baron de Peyreleau,de Peyreleau (baron), Eug√®ne Edouard Boyer (1825) Les Antilles fran√ßaises: particuli√®rement la Guadeloupe, depuis leur d√©couverte jusqu'au ler novembre 1825. Volume 3. (Ladvocat). sent by Louis XVIII to repossess the colony were quickly disturbed by the return of Napoleon I in April 1815 (Hundred Days). A conflict broke out between Bonapartists and monarchists. On 19 June 1815, Sir Comte de Linois (monarchist) forced by Sir Boyer de Peyreleau (Bonapartist), rejoined the Bonapartists and sent away a British frigate dispatched by the governor of the Windward Islands in Martinique, Sir Pierre Ren√© Marie, Comte de Vaugiraud to bring back the monarchical order of Louis XVIII. Sir Comte de Vaugiraud relieved them of their duties and the British took the offensive. Les Saintes were captured again by the crown of Great Britain on 6 July 1815, Marie- Galante on 18 July and Guadeloupe on 10 August. Despite the defeat of the Bonapartists and the restoration of Louis XVIII, on the request of the slave planter of Guadeloupe (favourable to the British because of their abolitionist minds) and by order of General Leith the British stayed to purge the colony of Bonapartism. The Bonapartists were judged and deported. The British troops left the colony to the French on 22 July 1816. Sir Antoine Philippe, Comte de Lardenoy was named by the King, Governor and Administrator of Guadeloupe and dependencies on 25 July 1816. It was in 1822 that the Chevalier de Fr√©minville legend was born. Christophe-Paulin de la Poix, named Chevalier de Fr√©minville, a sailor and naturalist in a military campaign to les Saintes aboard the vessel La N√©r√©√Øde shared a dramatic love story with a Saintoise named Caroline (known as \\"Princess Caroline\\" in reference to her legendary beauty). She committed suicide down from the artillery battery of Morel Hill which bears her name today, thinking her beloved man dead at Saint-Christopher, not seeing him come back from campaign. This condemned the knight to madness; taken by sorrow, he took Caroline's clothes and returned to Brest, where he stayed until the end of his days. Engravings and narratives are kept at Fort Napol√©on museum.M√©moires du Chevalier de Freminville d'Eug√®ne HERPIN √©d. La D√©couvrance √©ditions col. NORD In 1844, during Louis Philippe I's reign, the construction of a fort began on the ruins of the old Fort Louis. The fortification was built to the technique of Vauban to protect the archipelago against a possible reconquest. In 1851, a penitentiary was built on Petite Martinique island, which became renamed √Ælet √† Cabrit; in 1856 a prison reserved for women replaced it. It was destroyed in 1865 by a hurricane. The fort, begun during Louis-Philippe's reign, was finished in 1867 in the reign of Napoleon III who baptised it Fort Napol√©on in honour of his uncle, Napoleon I. Fort de la Reine was renamed Fort Jos√©phine at the same time. A lazaretto was opened in 1871 instead of the penitentiary. On 9 August 1882, under Jules Gr√©vy's mandature, at the request of the municipal councillors and following the church's requirements asking for the creation of Saint-Nicholas's parish, the municipality of Terre-de-Bas was created, separating from Terre-de-Haut which also became a municipality. This event marked the end of the municipality of les Saintes. The patron saint's day of Terre-de-Bas was then established on 6 December, St Nicholas'Day. In 1903, the military and disciplinary garrisons were definitively given up. It was the end of the \\"Gibraltar of the Antilles\\", but in honour of its military past, the ships of the navy made a traditional stopover. In 1906, the cruiser Duguay-Trouin stopped over at les Saintes. In September 1928, les Saintes, like its neighbouringislands of Guadeloupe, were violently struck by a strong cyclone which destroyed an important part of the municipal archives. From 1934 the first inns were built, which marked the beginning of visits to the island by the outside world.Bonjour les Saintes! aut. Jean-Michel Renault ed. le P√©lican =Dissidence and French overseas departmentalisation= In June 1940, answering the appeal of General de Gaulle, the French Antilles entered into a Resistance movement against Vichy regime and Nazi collaboration. They called it Dissidence. The governor, appointed by Marshal Philippe P√©tain, Constant Sorin, was in charge of administering Guadeloupe and its dependencies. Les Saintes became the Mecca of dissidence. The French Antilles were affected by the arbitrary power and the authoritarian ideology of P√©tain and Pierre Laval. The ministry of the colonies of Vichy, by its colonial representatives Mr. Constant Sorin and Admiral Georges Robert, High Commissioner of France, applied its whole legislation including the anti-semitic laws. A strong police state was set up and any resistance was actively repressed. Seeing the rallying of the French Antilles to the regime of Vichy, the islands were embargoed by the British- American forces. Cut from any relationship (in particular the import of fuels and foodstuffs) with France, Constant Sorin set up a policy of rationing and self-sufficiency, by diversifying and increasing the local production. It was a period of resourcefulness. On 27 October 1940, the General council was dissolved and the Mayors of Guadeloupe and its dependencies were relieved of their duties and replaced by prominent citizens appointed by the Vichy government. The mayor of Terre-de-Haut, Th√©odore Samson, was replaced by a B√©k√© of Martinique, Mr. de Meynard. Popular gatherings were forbidden and freedom of expression was banned by the regime. A passive resistance to Vichy and its local representatives was organised from 1940 to 1943. More than 4,000 French West Indians left their islands, at the risk of their life, to join the nearby British colonies. Then they rallied the Free French Forces, first by undertaking military training in the United States, Canada or Great Britain. At the same time, Fort Napol√©on became a political jail where the dissidents were locked.Pers√©e The Saintois boarded their traditional Saintoise to the Guadeloupean coast to pick up the volunteers for dissidence departure. Then, they were sailed through Dominica Passage, avoiding the cruisers and patrol boats of Admiral Robert. In March 1943, the French Guyanese rebelled against the regime and rallied the allies. French West Indians followed the movement and in April, May and June 1943, a civil movement of resistance took weapons and rebelled against Vichy's administration. In Martinique, the marines of Fort-de-France also rebelled against Admiral Robert. With shortages from the embargo making life more and more difficult, Admiral Robert sent to the Americans his will to capitulate, seeking the end of the blockade, on 30 June 1943. On 3 July 1943, the American admiral John Howard Hoover came to Martinique and on 8 July 1943, the American government required an unconditional surrender to the authority of the French Committee of National Liberation and offered asylum to Admiral Robert. On 15 July 1943, Governor Constant Sorin and Admiral Robert were relieved of their duties by Henri Hoppenot, ambassador of Free French Forces, and the French Antilles also joined the allies. Admiral Robert left the island the same day for the United States. Many of the dissidents were sent to the North African fronts and participated in Operation Dragoon beside the Allies. On 19 March 1946, the President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic promulgated the law of departmentalisation, which set up the colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique, La R√©union and French Guiana, as Overseas Departments. From then on, les Saintes, Marie-Galante, La D√©sirade, Saint-Barth√©lemy and the French side of Saint-Martin were joined, as municipalities, with Guadeloupe island into the new department of Guadeloupe. The colonial status up until then was replaced by a policy of assimilation to the rest of the metropolitan territory. In 1957, in the country's municipal elections, the mysterious death of the mayor of Terre-de-Haut, Th√©odore Samson, while he was in the office of the National Gendarmerie provoked an uprising of the population against the institution which was attacked with conches and stones. The revolt lasted two days before being quelled by the military and police reinforcements from Guadeloupe whom dissipated the crowd, looked for and arrested the insurgents (mainly of the \\"Pineau\\" family, Th√©odore Samson's political support). A frigate of the navy stayed a few weeks in the harbour of les Saintes to restore the peace. =Development of tourism= In 1963, the archipelago welcomed SS France during its first transatlantic voyage, which moored in the bay like the Italian, Swedish, Norwegian and American cruise ships which continue today to frequent the small archipelago. The era of the luxury yacht began. In 1969, the first hotel of the island, \\"Le Bois Joli\\" opened its doors at Anse √† Cointre beach. In 1972, les Saintes was equipped with a desalination plant to supply the population. However, distribution costs were too much, so the activity was abandoned in 1993 and replaced by a submarine supply piped from Capesterre-Belle-Eau. Similarly, for electricity, although an emergency power plant of fuel oil remains active on the island of Terre-de-Bas. In 1974, Fort Napol√©on was restored by the Club of the Old Manor House and the Saintoise Association of the Protection of Heritage (A.S.P.P), and accommodated a museum of the history and heritage of les Saintes. It became the most visited monument in the archipelago. In 1984, the Jardin Exotique de Monaco and Jardin botanique du Montet sponsored the creation of an exotic garden on the covered way of Fort Napol√©on. In 1990, for \\"La route des fleurs\\" (\\"The road of flowers\\", a national contest between the municipalities of France which rewards the most flowery municipality), Terre-de-Haut was coupled with the city of Baccarat, famous for its crystal glass-making. At the same time, the island of Terre-de-Haut was rewarded by an \\"environment Oscar\\" (a French award to municipalities protecting their heritage and environment) for the conservation of its heritage and natural housing environment. On 14 May 1991, the sites of the Bay of Pompierre and Pain de Sucre were classified as protected spaces according to the law of 2 May 1930.http://www.uicn.fr/IMG/pdf/05_UICN_2003_Biodiv_OM_-_Guadeloupe.pdf In 1994, the tourism office of les Saintes was created. The island welcomes approximately 300,000 visitors a year and became a destination appreciated by cruises and sailors. On 20 May 1994, during his travel in the Antilles, the Prime Minister of France, √âdouard Balladur, made an official visit to Terre- de-Haut. In May 2001, les Saintes joined the Club of the Most Beautiful Bays of the World. =2004 earthquake= On 21 November 2004, the islands of les Saintes were struck by an earthquake of magnitude 6.3. It was an intraplate earthquake situated on a system of normal faults going from les Saintes to the north of Dominica. These faults are globally directed 135¬∞ (north-west to south-east), with dip north-east (Roseau fault, Ilet fault, Colibri fault, Marigot Fault) or south-west (Souffleur fault, Rodrigues fault, Redonda fault). These faults bound zones of rifts corresponding to an extension located on Roseau volcano (an inactive submarine volcano). The epicentre was offshore, located between the island of Dominica and les Saintes archipelago, at approximately 15¬∞47'N 61¬∞28'W, on Souffleur fault. The depth of the focus is located on the earth's crust, and is superficial, about . The concussions of the main shock and the numerous aftershocks were powerful, reaching an intensity of VIII (important structural damage) on the MSK scale. Damage to the most vulnerable properties in les Saintes, in Trois-Rivi√®res (Guadeloupe) and in the North of Dominica was considerable. In Trois-Rivi√®res, a collapsed wall killed a sleeping girl and seriously hurt her sister. In les Saintes, even though no-one was killed or badly wounded, many were traumatised by the strong and numerous aftershocks. =Political and institutional evolution= On 7 December 2003, the islands of les Saintes, integrated into the department of Guadeloupe, participated in a referendum on the institutional evolution of that French Overseas Department and rejected it by a majority of \\"No\\". During the 2009 French Caribbean general strikes, les Saintes did not get involved in the movement and were only moderately affected: the supply of stores was very perturbed like other places in Guadeloupe, but these strikes mostly concerned small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (weakly presented on these islands). The maritime transport companies tried hard to find some Gasoil to assure most of the connections, and the Guadeloupean tourism was partially transferred to les Saintes. Nicolas Sarkozy declared, at the end of the conflict, the opening of √âtats-G√©n√©raux de l'Outre-mer (\\"Estates-general of the Overseas\\"). Several study groups were created, one of which looked into the local governance, brought to conceive an institutional modification project or a new status of Guadeloupe with or without emancipation of its last dependencies. The conferences of the \\"southern islands\\" (name of the last dependencies of Guadeloupe) (Marie Galante, les Saintes and la D√©sirade) were opened in parallel. Problems common to these islands were exposed in six study groups: the equality of opportunity, the territorial continuity, the local governance, the local economic development, the insertion by the activity and tourism. On 12 May 2009, the French overseas Minister, Yves J√©go, at the end of these conferences, made an official visit to les Saintes for the seminary of the southern islands of Guadeloupe. He took into account the identical reality and the political hopes of these islands, to improve the territorial continuity, to reduce the effects of the double-insularity, the abolition of the dependence to Guadeloupe, national representation, the development of the attractiveness of the labour pool in the zone, the fight against the depopulation, the tax system and the expensive life. For the moment he announced the signature of a contract baptised COLIBRI (\\"hummingbird\\"; Contract for the Employment and the Local Initiatives in the Regional Pond of the Southern Islands of Guadeloupe), a convention of the Grouping of Public Interest for Arrangement and Development (GIPAD) and a proposition of statutory evolution in final, like the study group of governance, the collective of the southern islands of Guadeloupe and the elected representatives asked it, on the basis of the article 74 of the French constitution. Les Saintes, like Marie Galante, aspires to the creation of an Overseas collectivity for each entity of the Southern islands, or combining the three dependences, on the same plan as the old northern islands of Guadeloupe (Saint-Barth√©lemy and Saint-Martin). Marie-Luce Penchard, native of Guadeloupe, brought in a governmental portfolio for overseas on 23 June 2009 and appointed Overseas Minister on 6 November 2009, seems wildly opposed to the initial project of her predecessor and delays applying it.Les √éles du Sud et l'Elys√©e - le blog fxgpariscaraibeCarib Creole News - ¬´LES ILES DU SUD¬ª Une r√©alit√© r√©volutionnaire! Yves J√©go en visite aux Saintes  Economy  Fishing was for a long time the main activity of les Saintes and is still an important employment sector. The local fishermen are respected throughout the Lesser Antilles for their bravery and their \\"hauls\\". For around thirty years, les Saintes has become a famous place for tourism and this activity underpins the local economy. Terre-de-Haut welcomes numerous boats which cast anchor in the bay of les Saintes, dubbed \\"one of the most beautiful bays of the world\\".www.World-Bays.Com Le club des plus belles baies du monde The hotel business and guest houses have spread, without disturbing this archipelago which has remained wild. The bay attracts luxury yachts, pleasure boats, cruise ships and big sailboats which cross through the Antilles. (84 stopovers of cruise for 2009) Terre-de-Haut annually receives more than 380,000 visitors who frequent businesses of the archipelago. Agriculture remains underdeveloped on these dry islands. An economic approach to all the activities is implemented by the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) of Guadeloupe. Economic activity remains relatively low, marked by strong disparities between Terre-de-Haut and Terre-de-Bas. The unemployment rate is 16.5% in Terre-de-Haut, and 34.5% in Terre-de-Bas (2017). The working population consists of a great majority of employees and salaried workers and a small percentage of storekeepers and craftsmen. The number of companies in the archipelago was 316 in 2015.  Climate  The climate of these islands is tropical, tempered by trade winds with moderate-high humidity. Despite its location between Guadeloupe and Dominica, the climate of les Saintes is different, and is more dry than its neighbours. It tends to get closer to the climate of St. Barts and most little islands of the Lesser Antilles. The archipelago covers an area of . Terre-de-Bas, the western isle, is wetter than Terre-de-Haut, the eastern. Though having 330 days of sunshine, the rainfall could reach but varies very widely. Summer is from May to November which is also the rainy season. Winter, from December to April, is the dry season. Sunshine is very prominent almost throughout the year and even during the rainy season. Humidity, however, is not very high because of the winds. It has an average temperature of with day temperatures rising to . The average temperature in January is while in July it is . The lowest night temperature could be . The Caribbean sea waters in the vicinity generally maintain a temperature of about . The archipelago faces frequent catastrophic threats of cyclonic storms.  Environment  Les Saintes extend only over but are characterised by a long coast, enriched by those of four small uninhabited islands. The coast of these islands does not have real cliffs, but their rocky shores are covered with corals. The sandy shores are more-or-less colonised by marine spermatophyte plants. In 2008, the inventory of the natural zones of ecological interest, fauna and flora (ZNIEFF) listed zones covering 381 hectares. View of Les Saintes from Guadeloupe island =Fauna= Land There are numerous ground iguanas, including the green iguana which is the heraldic symbol of Terre-de-Haut, and the Iguana delicatissima, which is threatened by the appearance of a hybrid stemming from the reproduction between the both species. Other reptiles include the Terre-de-Haut racer, Terre-de-Bas racer, the endemic Les Saintes anole,Alsophis sanctonum (Terre- De-Haut Racer) and lot of species of anoles. There are also agoutis, goats, and stick insects. Birds include the bananaquit, yellow-headed blackbird, dickcissel, blue-headed hummingbird, green-throated carib; purple-throated carib, and blue-tailed emerald. Ardeidaes rest in salty ponds (snowy egret, green heron, western cattle egret, yellow-crowned night heron, tricolored heron, etc.) and living with the aquatic turtles, the common moorhen, the blue land crab, the blackback land crab, the sand fiddler crab and other species of crabs. The common kestrel is visible and audible during rides into the dry forest, like the zenaida dove, an endemic species of West Indies protected inside the archipelago. Frogs include the Eleutherodactylus pinchoni, among others. Tree bats feed on papayas and other fruits and berries. Marine The archipelago shelters a variety of: * Coral fishes (parrotfish, Cephalopholis, trumpetfish, mero, Epinephelus adscensionis, cardinalfish, damselfish, sergeant major fish, queen triggerfish, sunfish, scrawled cowfish, schoolmaster snapper, groupers, moray eels, conger, green moray, black scorpionfish (venomous), red snapper, balloonfishes, Atlantic blue tang surgeonfish, etc.); * Pelagic fishes * Royal spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) and Brazilian lobsters (Panulirus guttatus) * Crustaceans (spiny spider crabs, edible crab, shrimp, slipper lobster, etc.) * Molluscs (bobtail squid, squid, octopuses) * Shells (Strombus gigas renowned for their flesh, helmet shell, clam, whelks, etc.) *Sea anemone, seahorse, seaweeds, sea urchin white and black, polyps and other species of cnidarians (jellyfish) * Corals (diploria, fire corals, etc.) from Caribbean islands, which are prevalent during dives around the archipelago * Sharks and rays It is not rare to observe in Les Saintes Passage cetaceans: humpback whales, sperm whales, killer whales, and dolphins, which during their migration reproduce in the warm seas of the Antilles.Observation des c√©tac√©s, baleines, dauphins, tortues, cachalots en Guadeloupe Sea birds (magnificent frigatebird, brown booby, masked booby, terns, double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels) nest on the cliffs and uninhabited islands. In particular, on Grand-√élet, a natural reserve of the archipelago which houses species of booby found nowhere else on les Saintes: red-footed booby (Sula sula) and blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). But in the context of global warming and invasive foreign species implanted by the humans (e.g. red lionfish), the environment and the biodiversity of these islands are considered to be very vulnerable and to be protected. It is therefore recommended that visitors do not take plants or capture animals to avoid disturbing the species in their natural biotope, and do not pollute the ecosystem. Sea turtle protection Numerous species are endemic and strictly protected, listed, and guarded by the Conservatoire du littoral (\\"Coastal protection agency\\" ), particularly the sea turtles, in application of the international convention ratified by France. Indeed, les Saintes is the preserve of seven varieties of sea turtle,R√©seau tortues marines guadeloupe among which three (those in bold type) lay on the beaches of the island: *the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) *the flatback sea turtle (Natator depressus) *the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) *the olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) *the Kemp's ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) *the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) *the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) Bay of Les Saintes. =Flora= The flora is typical of the xerophile forests of the volcanic Antilles islands: *Soapberries *Tabebuia pallida *Tabebuia heterophylla *Eugenia (Eugenia axillaris) - (a species of Myrtaceae, the fruits of which allow the manufacturing of the local and typical liqueur of wild cherry, ap√©ritif of les Saintes)Les Saintes: d√©pendances de la Guadeloupe - F√©lix Breta - Google Livres *Acerola (Malpighia emarginata) *Gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba) *Plumeria alba *Manchineel (Hippomane mancinella) - a toxic tree marked with red lines on their trunks by the Conservatoire du Littoral *Chinee apple or permseret (Ziziphus mauritiana) the edible fruits of which are used in the manufacturing of a punch softened in white rum. *Flamboyant red or yellow- flowered (Delonix regia) *Guapinol (Hymenaea courbaril) *Tamarind (Tamarindus indica), the fruits of which are used to make one of the specialities of Terre-de-Bas island, called \\"limb√© \\", a small home-made candy *West Indian bay tree (Pimenta racemosa) - much more present on the hills of Terre-de-Bas where the inhabitants use it to make the Bay rum, a rub lotion with curative qualities, the efficiency of which was widely proved in the Antilles. Also, certain species can be used in hair creams, allegedly favouring a fast regrowth and nutrition of hair. The seeds are also used as a spice to perfume dishes. The exploitation of pimenta is assured by the association \\"Le Mapou\\" at Terre-de-Bas island, in the medicinal garden \\"√âloit Germain\\". The aridity allowed the establishment of colonies of very diversified cacti and succulents, which the most remarkable are: *Ceroid cacti *prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) *Melocactus - which are on the logo of the Tourist information office of the archipelago. *Aloe The dry ground of the hills is strewn with herbaceous plants, sometimes composed by urticant lianas (Acalypha arvensis), cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa), Croton balsamifer, philodendron and fabaceaes (trees with toxic or edible seeds), pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan), sword beans (Canavalia gladiata), Senna alexandrina, margosa or bitter melon (Momordica charantia), Caesalpinia ciliatea, Caesalpinia bonduc (from which children make balls), rosary pea (Abrus precatorius), castor oil plant (Ricinus communis - used in the local small business sector). The seaside has a vegetation of: *Yellow, green or orange huge coconut palms *Baygrape (Coccoloba uvifera) *Portia tree (Thespesia populnea) *Paradise plum (Chrysobalanus icaco) *Muricife (creole term), a variety of edible West Indian olive that has almost disappeared from beaches Three rare species of orchid grow naturally in the archipelago and are the object of a severe protection: *Fringed star orchid (Epidendrum ciliare) *Tolumnia urophylla *Brassavola cucullata - more rare; endangered on les Saintes Numerous walking tours were established by the Conservatoire du Littoral through the forest, in such a way to allow observation of these natural resources, the historic ruins of the fortifications, and the exceptional panoramas offered by les Saintes to its visitors. Marigot Bay, Terre-de-Haut. The sand of the beaches is dominantly white or golden, although some zones of black sand remain under the white sand. On the semi-submerged rocks, crabs can be found: Ghost crab (Ocypode quadrata), hermit crab (Pagurus bernhardus), Sally lightfoot (Grapsus grapsus). =Environmental and energy policy= Numerous things are done to protect this fragile ecosystem at international, national, departmental and municipal level. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) listed several sites of the archipelago and categorised their degree of protection according to the current classification. So, several sites are registered in category IV, as defined by the non-governmental organisation. During the 1990s, most of the beaches and hills of the archipelago were listed under a decree of biotype protection (Grande Anse beach, √élet √† Cabrit, Morel hill). At the request of the municipality and the Departmental Council, the bays of Pompierre and Pain de Sucre were classified by a French law of 2 May 1930 (relative to the protection of the natural monuments and the sites of artistic, historic, scientific, legendary or picturesque character). The Conservatoire du littoral agency has acquired several areas, in particular Grand Ilet and Chameau hill, under the framework of the national program of protection of natural spaces. On 31 December 2010, the open-air garbage dump, an environmental problem for the archipelago for a long time, was closed and replaced by waste sorting. Now, waste is compacted and sent by boat to Guadeloupe to be recycled. Moreover, plastic bags have disappeared from grocers' shops and other businesses on the archipelago. Each municipality helped its inhabitants to change their habits by distributing reusable shopping bags. With these new political measures, les Saintes is more committed to the protection of the environment and its heritage.La Guadeloupe entre terre et mer ed.

Thanks to this, les Saintes can supply electricity to the south of Basse-Terre (Guadeloupe).  Culture  The exceptional landscapes, heritage and scenes of life of Les Saintes inspire many artists, including Pascal Foy and Martine Cotten.Accueil = Language = The archipelago of les Saintes is mostly populated by the descendants of colonists from Brittany and Normandy, Poitou, Saintonge and Anjou, who are mostly from the first French families that lived on Saint Christopher and Nevis when it was a French colony. The population has the peculiarity of being primarily of European origin and speaking a variety of popular American French, with some terms of Old French. The French of France is the official language and taught in schools. Among the languages of the archipelago, the Creole or patois (dialect) of les Saintes, stemming from the interbreeding of the Europeans and from the Creole influence of the slaves brought into the archipelago, is the most practiced by far. Les Saintes Creole is a French-based creole language, and is included the category of the agglutinative languages. It differs from those of the neighbouring islands (Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante and Dominica) by its very Gallicised pronunciation. It is close to the Creole spoken on the eastern side of the island of Saint-Barth√©lemy. Certain phonemes of the French language (, , , and ) disappeared from the modern creole of Guadeloupe, Dominica and Martinique are found in this dialect. Contrary to other French Antilles creoles which have diverged from French, Les Saintes Creole is moving toward it, in particular by a hyper-correction of the pronunciation of [r], considered a sign of speaking well. This may be a legacy of the first colonists who considered, by phenomenon of diglossia, the dialect as a secondary language lower than French and tried hard to avoid pronouncing [r] in the Guadeloupean way [w]. There is a second variant of this dialect, caused by the isolated evolution of the groups on two different islands. Terre-de- Haut Island's dialect can be distinguished from that of Terre-de-Bas. The variant of Terre-de-Bas is the same, with a different accent, and certain expressions which are typical. Even if the correct French language remains the educational parental priority, there is no generational problem in learning and speaking Creole. However, it is necessary to avoid talking in Creole for people exercising public authority, the elders and unknown people. There are many other peculiarities of this dialect. Les Saintes creole is still spoken and Saintois are proud of its difference with the other Creoles. Though it is not taught in schools, it is transmitted orally from parents to their children.Terre-de-Haut des Saintes : contraintes insulaires et particularisme ethnique aut. Jean-Luc BONNIOL = Feast days and long-standing customs = The calendar of feast days and customs are guided by the Christian feast days. The traditions of the Church are very long-lived in the islands. The public holidays are the same as those of France, plus those specific to the Guadeloupe overseas department and those of Les Saintes. The Christian feast days (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost) are celebrated by mass in the churches, embellished by the choirs of both parishes. Some feast days have peculiarities: *Corpus Christi: The believers follow a procession through the streets of the island with the priest who protects the Monstrance (Blessed Sacrament) covered with beautiful local embroidery to a cave, where there are children dressed as cherubs throwing flower petals. The local residents who liv along the route of procession go out to the entrance of their house, their fishing nets decorated with fruits and flowers, with Christian icons and paintings of The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci). *Fishing and fishermen days: celebrated on 11 June every year with a fishing competition, net making, remembrance of dead fishermen, and dancing. *Public holidays on 15 and 16 August: August 15th is the patron saint's day of Terre-de-Haut Island (Our- Lady-of-Assumption). The Mayor, his municipal council and officials are dressed as much as the boats in the bay. There are artillery salvos, drum majorettes, a torchlight procession, and bugle reveille. The island celebrates the 15 August 1666 victory of the French fleet against the English occupying the archipelago. A procession with the status of Our-Lady-of-Assumption is led through the streets of the island before ending on the beach where the priest throws a spray of flowers to the sea. It is the signal for the regatta of saintoise sail (traditional boat of les Saintes). A ship of the French Navy is present for the occasion, particularly la Fougeuse a Patrol boat, of which Terre-de-Haut island is the godmother. Officers and sailors wearing their bachis (Seaman (Matelot) and Quartermaster (Quartier-ma√Ætre) hat in French navy characterised by a small red pom-pom) walk on the island. In the past, French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (R97) attended the festivities. :16 August is sailors and seamen day. A procession is held in remembrance of dead sailors. The programme is: election of beauty queens, dancing, competitions and fireworks, which begin from 14 August. Today, 15 and 16 August are very famous and are a festival of Caribbean music, where numerous artists attend. Terre- de-Bas island holds its festivities on 8 and 9 August. This is the commemoration of 9 August 1882, the creation of the municipality of Terre-de- Bas. *Sinterklaas: 6 December is the Patron saint's day of Terre-de-Bas Island (Saint Nicholas ). Festival of the island. *Carnival is celebrated in February by wearing luxurious fancy dresses and masks in the streets under the rhythms of West Indian steel drums for fat days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday (at night in pyjamas), on Fat Tuesday (Mardi Gras) and on Ash Wednesday (wearing black and white, closing the carnival by the burning of the marionette Vaval, King of Carnival). People go to the church after the carnival for liturgical marking with ashes. A traditional mask, known in the creole as Mo-vivant (\\"zombie\\"), frightens the children, particularly during Fat Tuesday. =Local crafts= Crafts are still very prominent on the archipelago, which still produce typical objects: *the Salako, a traditional hat made from bamboo fibres, probably native of Indochina. It is a conical hat, traditionally covered with white fabric for the top and blue for the bottom, but also dressed in madras fabric; it is manufactured by the craftsmen of Terre-de-Bas. A salako (traditional hat). *The Saintoise, a fishing boat which is used in all the Lesser Antilles due to its reliability and its manoeuvrability. It is the work of the old marine carpenters of the island who have modernised it by motorising it. Its traditional shape is in veil and wood and is used during regattas today. Guadeloupe took back this tradition of les Saintes, and restored local sailing by creating an annual regatta which takes place in July, the TGVT (Guadeloupe Traditional Sail Tour). The saintoise is built in shipyards which receive orders from numerous Caribbean islands (e.g. shipyard Alain Foy, shipyard Pineau, etc.). *Embroidery, sewing, crochet, and weaving: coming from Breton and Norman ancestral traditions, the ladies of the island prepare basketwork in latan palm leaves, and sew. As well as parasols, slippers, baby clothes, curtains, place mats, mantillas, beddings and pillowcases embroidered or crocheted by the extraordinary dextrous ladies of the archipelago. Their products are sometimes exhibited in city halls and sold in front of the doors of their residences. The men make bow nets for fishing and weave the bamboo fibres for the bottoms of chairs and rocking chairs. *Furniture, model making and wooden toys: furniture (beds, sideboards, consoles, rocking chairs), and model boats are created by very skillful carpenters. Marionettes, cars (kabwa in Creole) and wooden traditional spinning tops are made on the island, and are still appreciated by the children. *The housing environment: Les Saintes is renowned for the charm and the cleanliness of its houses. Everything is minutely detailed: railings, doors with flaps, venetian blinds, the designs, and the decorative friezes covering gutters along the roof. Wood is still the most important material of local crafts. =Music= Like on all the islands of the Lesser Antilles, music livens up life of the people from les Saintes. The musicians who, in the past, occupied squares to play West Indian and French tunes with their accordions, violins and harmonicas are now replaced by small bands which provide rhythm to the parties and carnivals of the islands. (SOS band, Unison, M√©lody Vice, Explosion, etc.) The traditional music (Creole Quadrille, Biguine, mazouk from Martinique) is still present for the folk balls when the inhabitants wear their traditional costumes and sing the island's creole hymns Viv p√©yi an nou, viv les Saintes an nou (\\"Long live our country, long live our les Saintes\\") or Viv Terre-de-Haut (\\"Long live Terre-de-Haut\\") for official occasions such as ministerial visits or the island's patron saint's day on 15 August. Gwo ka music, contrary to on neighbouring Guadeloupe where it comes from, made only brief appearances to les Saintes, and has not integrated into Les Saintes' traditions. Haitian Compas music and the Guadeloupean combos of the 70s (les Aiglons, la Perfecta, etc.) are very appreciated and are played in all the celebrations of life (marriages, public baptisms, balls, etc.). The Creole waltz remains the traditional emblem of the opening of the ball for the newlyweds of the archipelago. Zouk, Salsa, Merengue, Dancehall, French and international varieties of music are popular with young people who dance to these rhythms in bars and clubs. Les Saintes have also inspired the Guadeloupean singer Francky Vincent who dedicated a title to the archipelago: Le tourment d'amour. A singer from les Saintes called \\"Joyeux des cocotiers\\" who sang the songs La cousine and Pina colada coco loco became famous in the French Antilles as part of an illustrious band from Terre-de-Bas: L' √âtoile des mers which created the titles: La vi p√©ch√® (L'an m√® la enrag√©), Pwobl√®m and Ti marin p√©ch√®. =Cuisine= The food of the islands is mainly composed of products of the sea and creole culinary dishes. These include fish Court- bouillon, Colombo (a creole dish of meat spiced with curry, curcuma, saffron and cumin), black pudding, and accras de Morue (saltfish). Some typical specialities are: *Le \\"Tourment d'amour\\": a small tartlet consisting of a pie crust pastry, with jam (traditionally coconut) wholly covered with a sponge cake. These tartlets are very widespread in the archipelago, and are sold at the port to the visitors arriving from the ferries. Every year, for the patron saint's day, a competition for the best and biggest \\"tourment d'amour\\" is held. They are now also made with jam of other tropical fruits, e.g. banana, guava, passion fruit and pineapple. Musician Francky Vincent praised these in one of his musical compositions. A tourment d'amour (traditional tartlet). *Fish pancakes: to honour their ancestral roots, les Saintes' people have created a pancake with the peculiarity of being filled by a fish stuffing and a bechamel sauce. It is baked in the oven and covered with dried breadcrumbs. *Fish cake: a fish terrine, baked in the oven and served fresh. *\\"Limbe\\": a small candy made on the island of Terre-de-Bas with tamarinds, sugar and condensed milk. *\\"Fwisu\\": a special preparation of goat blood, spiced with onion, thyme and garlic, served as a warm starter. It is similar to the Sanquette, a traditional dish of the regions of the South of France. *\\"Wog\\": a kind of local caviar - fish eggs, that les Saintes' people prepare by frying. Mahi-mahi eggs are usually used. *Eugenia liqueur: small wild berries of les Saintes steeped in white rum to give a liqueur. When aged, it has a bigger flavour. It is considered to be the local wine due to its colour and taste.

Terre-de-Bas has a general practitioner. The pharmacy is located on Terre-de-Haut. The fire brigades are equipped with equipment and vehicles adapted to fight against disasters and to carry assistance. Other care and specialities are located at Basse-Terre or Pointe-√†-Pitre and in case of emergency, the fire brigade can call the helicopter of S√©curit√© Civile to come from Guadeloupe.  Transport  The transport on Terre-de-Haut mainly consists of scooters and motorcycles. Scooter rental companies are available to tourists. Cars are rare. Small ferries make several daily connections between Terre-de-Bas, Terre-de-Haut, Trois-Rivi√®res (Guadeloupe island), and Basse-Terre. Other connections, essentially for tourists, are made several times a week to Pointe-√†-Pitre, Grand-Bourg (Marie-Galante), Roseau (Dominica) or Fort-de-France (Martinique).

The Chelsea Market complex occupies an entire city block with a connecting bridge over Tenth Avenue to the adjacent 85 Tenth Avenue building. The High Line passes through the 10th Avenue side of the building. Chelsea Market was constructed in the 1890s and was originally the site of the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) factory complex where the Oreo cookie was invented and produced. The complex was redeveloped in the 1990s and features a retail concourse at ground level with office space above. Chelsea Market is currently owned by Alphabet Inc., parent company of Google. Chelsea Market lies within the \\"Gansevoort Market Historic District\\", which is recognized by New York State and National Register of Historic Places. Description The Chelsea Market complex fills an entire city block bounded by Ninth and Tenth Avenues and 15th and 16th Streets, with a connecting bridge over Tenth Avenue to the adjacent 85 Tenth Avenue building, which was also part of the Nabisco complex but is now separately owned. In addition to the retail concourse, it also provides standard office space for tenants, including media and broadcasting companies such as Oxygen Network, Food Network, MLB.com, BAMTech, EMI Music Publishing and the local New York City cable station NY1. More recently, Google has moved into some of the second, third, fourth, seventh, and eighth floors along with its subsidiary YouTube on the fifth. Retail facilities were introduced into the building by connecting the original back lots of individual buildings to a central, ground-level concourse with entries at 9th and 10th Avenues (completed in April 1997). Anchor stores include Pearl River Mart, the Chelsea Market Baskets, Posman Books, Sarabeth's Bakery, Manhattan Fruit Exchange, BuonItalia, Anthropologie, and the Buddakan restaurant. There is also Miznon, the Fat Witch Bakery, Amy's Bread, Ruth's Bakery, Chelsea Wine Vault, Eleni's Bakery, Ninth Street Espresso, The Lobster Place, Dickson's Farmstand, The Green Table, Chelsea Thai and Friedman's Lunch, an Italian fresh pasta restaurant called Giovanni Rana Pastificio e Cucina, as well as a variety of smaller stores selling cheese, artisanal salt and olive oil, chocolate and flowers. In November 2015 Davidovich Bakery announced the opening of a Davidovich Bagels location at the Chelsea Market. In January 2006 Morimoto, owned by Food Network \\"Iron Chef\\" Masaharu Morimoto and designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, opened on the 10th Avenue side. The Food Network used to film its shows Iron Chef America and Emeril Live in the Chelsea Market complex. The developers of Chelsea Market encourage a symbiotic relationship among their tenants with the vendors supplying the restaurateurs with fresh ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, fruit and meats. Chelsea Market brings diverse tenants, businesses, and vendors together that encourage tenants to foster community and cultivate business support among one another. The presence of television companies in the same building also brings media attention to the site and the businesses that are found there. The site also allows businesses to combine their manufacturing and retail assets under one roof. The High Line, which opened in the spring of 2009, passes through the building's Tenth Avenue side. This abandoned, elevated railroad track has been converted to an urban oasis or greenway, which now forms a continuous route between the Javits Center and the Meatpacking District. History Construction of baking facilities by local concerns at this location began in the 1890s, and merger of several companies into the National Biscuit Company (often then known as NBC) occurred in 1898. Nabisco continued to expand the facilities until the company's departure for the suburbs in 1958. The final configuration consists of 19 separate structures taking up the entire city block, and included both production areas and offices. Several decades of varying levels of occupancy and light industrial use followed Nabisco's departure as the commercial character of the neighborhood declined. Since its redevelopment by new owner Irwin Cohen with Jeff Vandeberg and Vandenberg Architects in the 1990s, the complex has featured a retail concourse at ground level with office space above, and is distinguished by its light-hearted touches and re-use of historic urban artifacts. The majority of the original buildings consist of heavy timber wood construction with brick facades and were designed by the firm of Romeyn & Stever. There is also an interior pedestrian bridge on some upper levels to allow people to cross from the north to south sides of the courtyard. The building on the Tenth Avenue side is a later structure designed in the 1930s by Nabisco's then-architect Louis Wirsching Jr. that replaced the original baking facilities there. Its construction coincided with that of the High Line, allowing a freight train siding to be built directly within the building itself. Rail and aluminum-clad walking bridge connections were also added going across 10th Avenue to tie in the existing 85 Tenth Avenue building across the street. Chelsea Market lies within the \\"Gansevoort Market Historic District\\", which is recognized by New York State and National Register of Historic Places. It was nominated by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, which advocated for the New York City Historic District in the Meatpacking District to include properties north to 16th Street. However, the area designated in 2003 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission stops shy of 15th Street. In 2012, then-owners Jamestown L.P. received approval to proceed with a planned 6-story office tower expansion above the western portion of the site, despite significant opposition by community and activist groups. Construction of the expansion project had not yet started as of 2014. In 2018, Google parent company Alphabet Inc. bought Chelsea Market for more than $2.4 billion. Google owns 111 Eighth Avenue, across Ninth Avenue from Chelsea Market. Prior to the sale of the market, Google leased space in the building. The sale was described as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in history of New York City.

A two-year junior college course was added in 1925, and the name was changed in 1930 to Friends Bible College to more fully reflect the growing mission of the institution. By 1968, the school's vision put an emphasis on the four-year institution, leading to closure of the high school program and an effort to secure necessary faculty and facilities. This effort received general recognition in 1975 with the granting of full accreditation by the Association for Biblical Higher Education.

Plot summary In Starless Night, Drizzt decides to return to Menzoberranzan in an attempt to keep the evil drow from launching another attack on Mithral Hall. He gives Guenhwyvar to Regis and tells him not to tell anyone where he went. When Cattie-brie later questions Regis about Drizzt's disappearance, and she makes Regis tell the truth. Regis then gives her Guenhwyvar and she decides to follow Drizzt . She first stops at the city of Silverymoon to meet with Lady Alustriel and to procure supplies. Alustriel, who has feelings for Drizzt, gives Catti-brie horses with magic horseshoes and makes a dwarven attendant, Fret, accompany her to the entrance of the Underdark. Meanwhile, Drizzt meets several elves in the woods near the Underdark, and recalls the surface raiding party that he was a part of as a young drow when he saved a young girl by pretending to kill her. She meets Drizzt, and the elves send a guide, Tarathiel, to help him through the woods. The pair encounters a unicorn in the grove of Montolio and Drizzt is able to pet it. He takes it as a sign that Mielikki, the goddess of rangers, approves of his sacrifice. He makes his way into the Underdark several days later. Catti-brie also arrives at the entrance to the Underdark within two days of Drizzt, and Fret goes back to Silverymoon. Drizzt goes first to Blingdenstone, the Underdark city of the deep gnomes, and stays for several days. Catti-brie also encounters a group of deep gnomes a day later and they show her a shortcut to Menzoberranzan. Then in Menzoberranzan, Drizzt is able to disguise himself for a little while as a slave driver on the Isle of Roth√©, but is later found out. Catti-brie is near Drizzt at this point, and she witnesses his capture before being taken by Jarlaxle and held prisoner by the mercenary group Bregan D'arthe. Drizzt is taken to Matron Baenre's dungeon and tortured by one of Baenre's daughters, Vendes, the chief torturer. Entreri, somehow surviving the fall in the previous book, is now essentially the prisoner of Jarlaxle. He makes a deal with Cattie-brie in a bid to return to the surface and escape the evil drow city. He and Catti-brie steal a number of magical items from Bregan D'arthe and the sorcerer Gromph in order to free Drizzt from House Baenre during a ceremony involving all of the matrons of the eight ruling Houses of Menzoberranzan. Drizzt then kills Vendes, and in the daring escape out of the compound fights Dantrag Baenre, who was always considered the second-best to Zaknafein (and after Zaknafein's death, Drizzt). Drizzt is victorious, obtaining Dantrag's magical bracers, while Catti-brie chooses Dantrag's evil sentient sword Khazid'hea, who wanted to be wielded by Drizzt but could not (as Drizzt favors the scimitar). Catti-brie then explodes a section of the tunnel above the House Baenre compound, destroying most of the chapel dome and interrupting the ceremony of the Matron Mothers. Entreri escapes to the surface, and Catti-brie and Drizzt return to Mithral Hall, on the way stopping by the resting place of Wulfgar.

It was demonstrated that although overall health had improved since the introduction of the welfare state, there were widespread health inequalities. It also found that the main cause of these inequalities was economic inequality. The report showed that the death rate for men in social class V was twice that for men in social class I and that gap between the two was increasing, not reducing as was expected. Commissioning The Black report was commissioned in March 1977 by David Ennals, Labour Secretary of State, following publication of a two-page article by Richard G. Wilkinson in New Society, on 16 December 1976, entitled Dear David Ennals. The report was nearly ready for publication in early 1979. In the General Election on 3 May 1979, the Conservatives were elected. The Black Report was not issued until 1980 by the Conservative Government. The Black report was published on August Bank Holiday with only 260 copies made available on the day for the media. The foreword, by Patrick Jenkin rejected \\"the view that the causes of health inequalities are so deep rooted that only a major and wide-ranging programme of public expenditure is capable of altering the pattern.\\" He made \\"it clear that additional expenditure on the scale which could result from the report‚Äôs recommendations ‚Äì the amount involved could be upwards of ¬£2 billion a year ‚Äì is quite unrealistic in present or any foreseeable economic circumstances, quite apart from any judgement that may be formed of the effectiveness of such expenditure in dealing with the problems identified.\\" The report had a huge impact on political thought in the United Kingdom and overseas. It led to an assessment by the Office for Economic Co-Operation and Development and the World Health Organization of health inequalities in 13 countries.BMJ Obituary of Sir Douglas Black:\\"Sir Douglas Black: Professor of medicine whose famous report on inequality and health fell foul of the Thatcher government\\". Impact Professor Clare Bambra in 2016 compared the report with the later Acheson Report and the subsequent report by Michael Marmot. The Acheson report was released into a more favourable climate than either. She said that at least between 1997 and 2003, health policy across the UK reflected some of the ideas set out in the Black and Acheson Reports. There was a consistent emphasis on the need to tackle the social and economic determinants of health inequalities as well as a commitment to employing cross-cutting government policies to tackle health inequality. Most importantly, by 2004, national targets to reduce health inequalities were also introduced with a focus on life expectancy and Infant Mortality Rate. A series of initiatives were introduced - Health Action Zones, Healthy Living Centres, Health Improvement Programmes and the New Deal for Communities. But, perhaps because of these initiatives, from 2004 to 2007, public health policy moved away from social and economic determinants and instead focused more on health services and lifestyle behaviours.

A family of sets is said to be union-closed if the union of any two sets from the family remains in the family. The conjecture states: > For every finite union-closed family of finite sets, other than the family > containing only the empty set, there exists an element that belongs to at > least half of the sets in the family. Equivalent forms If F is a union-closed family of sets, the family of complement sets to sets in F is closed under intersection, and an element that belongs to at least half of the sets of F belongs to at most half of the complement sets. Thus, an equivalent form of the conjecture (the form in which it was originally stated) is that, for any intersection-closed family of sets that contains more than one set, there exists an element that belongs to at most half of the sets in the family. Although stated above in terms of families of sets, Frankl's conjecture has also been formulated and studied as a question in lattice theory. A lattice is a partially ordered set in which for two elements x and y there is a unique greatest element less than or equal to both of them (the meet of x and y) and a unique least element greater than or equal to both of them (the join of x and y). The family of all subsets of a set S, ordered by set inclusion, forms a lattice in which the meet is represented by the set-theoretic intersection and the join is represented by the set-theoretic union; a lattice formed in this way is called a Boolean lattice. The lattice-theoretic version of Frankl's conjecture is that in any finite lattice there exists an element x that is not the join of any two smaller elements, and such that the number of elements greater than or equal to x totals at most half the lattice, with equality only if the lattice is a Boolean lattice. As shows, this statement about lattices is equivalent to the Frankl conjecture for union-closed sets: each lattice can be translated into a union-closed set family, and each union-closed set family can be translated into a lattice, such that the truth of the Frankl conjecture for the translated object implies the truth of the conjecture for the original object. This lattice-theoretic version of the conjecture is known to be true for several natural subclasses of lattices; ; but remains open in the general case. Another equivalent formulation of the union-closed sets conjecture uses graph theory. In an undirected graph, an independent set is a set of vertices no two of which are adjacent to each other; an independent set is maximal if it is not a subset of a larger independent set. In any graph, the \\"heavy\\" vertices that appear in more than half of the maximal independent sets must themselves form an independent set, so there always exists at least one non- heavy vertex, a vertex that appears in at most half of the maximal independent sets. The graph formulation of the union-closed sets conjecture states that every finite non-empty graph contains two adjacent non-heavy vertices. It is automatically true when the graph contains an odd cycle, because the independent set of all heavy vertices cannot cover all the edges of the cycle. Therefore, the more interesting case of the conjecture is for bipartite graphs, which have no odd cycles. Another equivalent formulation of the conjecture is that, in every bipartite graph, there exist two vertices, one on each side of the bipartition, such that each of these two vertices belongs to at most half of the graph's maximal independent sets. This conjecture is known to hold for chordal bipartite graphs, bipartite series-parallel graphs, and bipartite graphs of maximum degree three. Families known to satisfy the conjecture The conjecture has been proven for many special cases of union- closed set families. In particular, it is known to be true for * families of at most 46 sets. * families of sets whose union has at most 11 elements., improving previous bounds by , and others. * families of sets in which the smallest set has one or two elements., since rediscovered by several other authors. If a one-element or two-element set S exists, some element of S belongs to at least half the sets in the family, but the same property does not hold for three-element sets, due to counterexamples of Sarvate, Renaud, and Ronald Graham. * families of at least (tfrac{1}{2}-varepsilon)2^n subsets of an n-element set, for some constant varepsilon>0. History P√©ter Frankl stated the conjecture, in terms of intersection-closed set families, in 1979, and so the conjecture is usually credited to him and sometimes called the Frankl conjecture. The earliest publication of the union- closed version of the conjecture appears to be by .

Specifically, if offered several bundles of goods, the agent will choose the bundle that offers the most X, no matter how much Y there is. Only when there is a tie between bundles with regard to the number of units of X will the agent start comparing the number of units of Y across bundles. Lexicographic preferences extend utility theory analogously to the way that nonstandard infinitesimals extend the real numbers. With lexicographic preferences, the utility of certain goods is infinitesimal in comparison to others. For example, if for a given bundle (X;Y;Z) an agent orders his preferences according to the rule X>>Y>>Z, then the bundles {(5;3;3), (5;1;6), (3,5,3)} would be ordered, from most to least preferred: # 5;3;3 # 5;1;6 # 3;5;3 *Even though the first option contains fewer total goods than the second option, it is preferred because it has more Y. Note that the number of X's is the same, and so the agent is comparing Y's. *Even though the third option has the same total goods as the first option, the first option is still preferred because it has more X. *Even though the third option has far more Y than the second option, the second option is still preferred because it has more X. A distinctive feature of such lexicographic preferences is that a multivariate real domain of an agent's preferences does not map into a real- valued range. That is, there is no real-valued representation of a utility function.Amartya K. Sen, 1970 [1984], Collective Choice and Social Welfare, ch. 3, \\"Collective Rationality,\\" pp. 34-35. Description. In terms of real valued utility, one would say that the utility of Y and Z is infinitesimal compared with X, and the utility of Z is infinitesimal compared to Y. The model of real numbers is always logically ambiguous; one is allowed to adjoin infinitesimal quantities to make a nonstandard model. Standard models of the real numbers exclude infinitesimals, so lexicographic preferences are not precisely described by standard reals. But by assigning a utility to X which is much much larger than the utility of Y, which in turn is much much larger than the utility of Z, the infinitesimal order relation can be approximated arbitrarily closely, which means this is a problem of idealized limits only. Implications If all agents have the same lexicographic preferences, then general equilibrium cannot exist because agents won't sell to each other (as long as price of the less preferred is more than zero). But if the price of the less wanted is zero, then all agents want an infinite amount of the good. Equilibrium cannot be attained with standard prices. The utilities are infinitesimal, but the prices are not. Allowing infinitesimal prices resolves this. Lexicographic preferences can still exist with general equilibrium. For example, *Different people have different bundles of lexicographic preferences such that different individuals value items in different orders. *Some, but not all people have lexicographic preferences. *Lexicographic preferences extend only to a certain quantity of the good. The nonstandard equilibrium prices for exchange can be determined for lexicographic order using standard equilibrium methods, except using nonstandard reals as the range of both utilities and prices. All the theorems regarding existence of prices and equilibria extend to the case of nonstandard utilities, since the nonstandard reals form a conservative extension, meaning that any theorem which is true for reals can be extended to the nonstandard reals and remains true. Lexicographic preferences are the classical example of rational preferences that are not representable by a utility function over the standard reals. If there were such a function U then, e.g. for 2 goods, the intervals [U(x,0),U(x,1)] would have a non-zero width and be disjoint for all x, which is not possible for an uncountable set of x-values. If there are a finite number of goods and amounts can only be rational numbers, utility functions do exist, simply by taking 1/N to be the size of the infinitesimal, where N is sufficiently large, to approximate nonstandard numbers. The relation is not continuous because for a decreasing convergent sequence x_n rightarrow 0 we have (x_n,0)>(0,1), while the limit (0,0) is smaller than (0,1). Origin of term Lexicography refers to the compilation of dictionaries, and is meant to invoke the fact that a dictionary is organized alphabetically: with infinite attention to the first letter of each word, and only in the event of ties with attention to the second letter of each word, etc. Notes  External links  * Lexicographic preference relation cannot be represented by a utility function.

The Spider Queen, Lolth, plots to keep Matron Baenre in power and to ultimately take Mithral Hall. In-house fighting results in the destruction of the 3rd house, House Oblodra, with the exception of their kobold/ goblin army, and the 4th house, House Faen Tlabbar, being left leaderless. Matron Baenre, along with the favor of Lolth, forms a loose house alliance to attack Mithral Hall. Realizing that they cannot possibly stop a drow army, the svirfnebli, the deep gnomes, are forced to abandon Blingdenstone. The battle for Mithral Hall takes place on the surface as well as in the Underdark. The drow were defeated with a little help from an unlikely source, the balor, Errtu. Through trickery, all Baenre wizardry and spells are temporarily interrupted and the heroes take advantage of the opening, killing Matron Baenre and defeating the drow offensive.

The Sea Sprite is indeed a feared force on the Sword Coast, with few pirates choosing to attack its deadly wizard, drow ranger, panther, archer or ballista. They have been hunting pirates for the six years after the Battle of Mithral Hall. The balor, Errtu, who needs Drizzt to break his banishment; takes Deudermont's shape and it is unmasked when it hints to a mysterious island. Deudermont looks for the island to find out who sent the creature. The Sea Sprite crew goes to Mintarn in search of information about the mysterious Caerwich. They are attacked by pirates, but they manage to escape also because of the magical arrival of Harkle Harpell, who joins the crew. After a long and perilous journey, the Sea Sprite reaches Caerwich. There more dangers await the companions, but they eventually find an old hag who gives a riddle message to Drizzt and Catti-brie. The drow believes that the message implies that his father is alive and held by Lolth. The companions look for more information from a fiend of the Abyss, contacting it through a priest. On the journey back, the Sea Sprite is nearly destroyed by a storm and is saved by Harkle, whose spell magically transports the damaged schooner in Impresk Lake, near the residence of the priest Cadderly Bonaduce. The companions go to Icewind Dale where Crenshinibon lies, the place where Errtu will more likely show up. In the meantime the crystal shard itself is found and taken by Stumpet Rakingclaw. Errtu is summoned by a wizard, but he breaks free and flies to Icewind Dale. He takes Crenshinibon from Stumpet, capturing her soul and using her body as a bait to lure Drizzt to him. Stumpet's body leads the companions to the Sea of Moving Ice. There they are attacked by Taers sent by Crenshinibon, and they beat the creatures because of the arrival of Revjak and his warriors. Berkthgar and his men, who were also following the companions, arrive as well and eventually the heroes make the barbarian realize his mistakes. The companions then proceed to their quest and they eventually reach Cryshal-Tirith, where battle with Errtu's minions ensues. Regis infiltrates the tower and, with cunning and willpower, he manages to lock Crenshinibon in a box from where its power can't escape. In the meantime the others are saved by the arrival of Kierstaad, son of Revjak, wielding Aegis-fang, taken from Bruenor's quarters. Errtu's prisoner, Wulfgar, breaks free and joins battle with his warhammer. The companions eventually defeat Errtu. Reception Trenton Webb reviewed Passage to Dawn for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. He commented that \\"Bucking the Prince, Princess and Dragon rescue trend, Passage to Dawn tries to add the extra element of mystery to the adventure by withholding the identity of the victim. So, where more traditional tales focus on the link between rescuer and abductee, this story drags its heroes the length of the Forgotten Realms on a mission to save somebody. They're not exactly sure who, but someone needs rescuing and there's a good chance of a ruck, too.\\" Webb adds: \\"This plotline employs an eclectic cast who seem bound by AD&D; reality when it suits them and liberally free of it when the plot gets out of hand. Drizzit, the star, is a male Ranger with a fondness for sunrises and the open sea, while the wizard Harkle Harpell behaves exactly as described in the Forgotten Realms expansion set The North, but his unbridled power and sudden appearance is, sadly, anything but convincing.\\" He continues: \\"Together with dwarven-raised humans, barbarian friendly halflings and kindhearted pirates, the characters do their damnedest to add gusto. But while this makes individual encounters fun, it begins to pull the weak plot out of shape. What starts out as a pirate chase turns into a treasure hunt, which leads the crew to a far away lake and back up north for a final showdown with a Balor.\\" Webb concludes his review by saying, \\"The result is a vaguely interesting tale which leaps between locales and characters for its own benefit rather than the reader's. All too often, your concentration is shattered by the introduction of Drizzit's essays on life, a sudden change of tack, or the arbitrary introduction of superfluous characters. There are some neat set-pieces but they just don't hold together.\\" Passage to Dawn debuted on The New York Times bestseller list at number 13.

It grew to be a significant Greek company with two factories in the north of Athens. MEBEA ST150 (1970) Used by the Hellenic Postal Service: MEBEA Hermes (1970) Designed for Asia: MEBEA FL (1971) Its most successful products were light three-wheeler trucks with 50 cc Z√ºndapp engines, that became a common sight all over the country for almost three decades and were exported (in commercial and passenger variants) to African and Asian markets. Its mopeds and motorcycles (models including the Junior, Apollon and Hermes) mostly used Z√ºndapp engines as well as MEBEA's own (built under Minarelli licence), and some were used, among others, by the Greek Postal Service and the Telecommunications Organization. Apart from the previously mentioned vehicles that were of its own development (MEBEA technology was also employed by another Greek motorcycle and three-wheeler manufacturer, Mego), the company cooperated with Reliant of Britain, starting licence production of the latter's TW9 heavier three-wheeler truck in 1970 (using a 1.2 l Triumph engine) and Robin three-wheel passenger car in 1974, while the MEBEA Fox automobile was presented as a joint development. In addition to the motorized vehicle construction mentioned above, other activities during MEBEA history included motorbike engine production (on Italian designs) for use in its lighter models as well as for export, and the operation of the bicycle division producing a range of bicycle models.  Development and fate of the Fox model  In 1979 MEBEA introduced the Fox light utility vehicle, in line with contemporary Greek 'fashion' for such vehicles like the Pony by Namco, the Farma by MAVA-Renault, and others that appeared later. The Fox was originally designed and built in prototype form by MEBEA itself on modified Reliant Kitten basis, but the final development for type certification was done in collaboration with Reliant in order to bypass the difficulties imposed by Greek law for a \\"passenger car\\" production permit. The company faced problems in the early 1980s when certain Asian markets were lost, but the final blow came when Greek law stopped 'favouring' light passenger-utility vehicles, essentially killing the Fox (along with about half a dozen similar Greek automobiles) which until then had accomplished modest sales, reaching about 3000 units. In 1983 production of the Fox was terminated (it then started in Britain, though, by Reliant itself), and soon MEBEA, a company associated with a wide variety of light vehicles that had almost become a part of Greek culture, ceased to exist.

It offers associate degree and certificate programs as well as healthcare certificate programs and business and industry programming. History Asnuntuck Community College was established in 1972 as the twelfth institution in the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system (CSCU). Classes began in 1972 with an initial enrollment of 251, and 12 Associate in Science degrees and 20 Associate of Art degrees were awarded to the first graduating class in 1974. The college operated under provisional approval until it was first accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges in 1977. Asnuntuck was subsequently reaccredited after comprehensive reviews in 1980 and 1985; an interim report was submitted to the New England Association in 1990, and accreditation was reaffirmed through 1995. This was followed by a 1995 comprehensive visit and a 2000 interim report that accredited the college to the present. In its infancy, the college was named North Central Connecticut Community College. In 1972, the Board of Trustees officially renamed the college \\"Asnuntuck\\", Native American for \\"fresh water\\", a reference to the Podunk tribe that once resided in the area, to the nearby Connecticut River and Freshwater Brook, and to a strong interest in the environment and ecology. The college has had three homes in its relatively brief life. It began in the former North School building in the Thompsonville section of Enfield, CT. In 1974, the college moved to a leased warehouse on Phoenix Avenue but gradually outgrew that location. The college moved to its current home in 1983, the former Kosciuszko Junior High School at 170 Elm Street. The years between 1989 and 1994 saw extensive renovations to improve classroom and laboratory space, revamp the auditorium, and add an annex to house the Learning Resource Center. The college has been an autonomous institution throughout most of its existence, with the exception of a period from 1985 to 1989. During those years, it was part of the Capital Region Community College District with Greater Hartford Community College and Tunxis Community College in Farmington. In 1992, the Connecticut legislature mandated merging the state's community and technical colleges. While there was no area technical college for an Asnuntuck merger, the legislature also required each community college to complement its general education with a technical focus, bringing about several programmatic changes, as well as the change to the name, Asnuntuck Community-Technical College. The technical focus remains, particularly in a recently established Manufacturing Technology (formerly known as Machine Technology) program, but the state community colleges dropped the word ‚Äútechnical‚Äù from their names in 1999, returning to the simpler name, Asnuntuck Community College. The majority of students focus on completing their studies at Asnuntuck and transferring to a 4-year institution. Another large percentage of the student population is enrolled in curricula that focus on workforce development. The Manufacturing Technology Center (MTC) prepares students for immediate entry into the workforce. 95% of the MTC students are already employed upon graduation. In 2016 Asnuntuck received state bond funding for campus improvements. The College was approved to receive $11.4 million for renovations and improvements including replacement of the roof; construction of a new building entrance; and the construction, renovation and improvement of student senate offices, conference areas, lounge, bookstore, a food service area with indoor and outdoor seating, and a community function area. Location Asnuntuck Community College in Enfield, Connecticut, is located just off Interstate 91, approximately halfway between the metropolitan areas of Springfield, Massachusetts, to the north and Hartford, Connecticut, to the south. Asnuntuck serves the north-central Connecticut communities of East Granby, East Windsor, Ellington, Enfield, Somers, Stafford Springs, Suffield, and Windsor Locks, and also draws students from south-central Massachusetts and the greater Hartford area. Programs Within recent years, Asnuntuck has established its own radio station, WACC-LP (107.7 FM) and opened an on-site welding program. Many area employers use Asnuntuck to train their workers in sophisticated machine technology, welding and Electro-mechanical technologies. The program has an over 90% placement rate and has recently expanded. Students can prepare for careers in allied health professions, the insurance and financial industry, and more. Asnuntuck Community College also has agreements with many four-year institutions, enabling Asnuntuck students who take appropriate courses and maintain the necessary Grade Point Average to enroll without loss of credit in Baccalaureate programs. The Asnuntuck Community College Foundation, the community's vehicle for philanthropic support of the college, offers many scholarships for new and continuing Asnuntuck students. First Amendment controversy Asnuntuck Community College student Nicholas Saucier had a conversation about gun legislation with Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy. The college charged Saucier with harassment and making threats. When Saucier challenged the charges at an official hearing, the college refused to review the video evidence of the incident; as Saucier video taped without permission. Saucier was found guilty of all charges and placed on probation after initially being dismissed from the college. The FIRE wrote a letter in January 2014 asking Asnuntuck Community College to reverse their dismissal of the student and uphold the student's free speech and due process rights. As of April 4, 2014, FIRE had not received any dispute directly from Asnuntuck Community College. During the ensuing controversy, the college hid or deleted critical comments from its Facebook page, and deleted said Facebook page shortly after being directly accused of censorship. Shortly after this, a new generic Facebook page appeared upon which many critical comments were posted. By August 5, 2014, this was merged with a resumed official Facebook page, with all critical comments deleted again. The College posted a social media policy indicating that only college officials would be allowed to post on the page.https://www.facebook.com/Asnuntuck/info According to Asnuntuck's home page, \\"Asnuntuck Community College does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religious creed, age, gender, gender identity or expression, national origin, marital status, ancestry, present or past history of mental disorder, learning disability or physical disability, political belief, veteran status, sexual orientation, genetic information, or criminal record.\\" References External links *Asnuntuck Community College website Enfield, Connecticut Community colleges in Connecticut Educational institutions established in 1972 Universities and colleges in Hartford County, Connecticut 1972 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Asnuntuck Community College"},{"id":"4308569","text":"Kirill Pavlovich Florensky (; 27 December 1915 - 9 April 1982) was a Russian Soviet geochemist and planetologist.

Abuse of power or abuse of authority, in the form of \\"malfeasance in office\\" or \\"official misconduct\\", is the commission of an unlawful act, done in an official capacity, which affects the performance of official duties. Malfeasance in office is often a just cause for removal of an elected official by statute or recall election. Officials who utilize abuse of power are often those who exploit the ability to use corruption in their advantage. In the United States, abuse of power has been cited in the impeachment of at least five federal officials. Two of these (Judge George English and President Richard Nixon) resigned before their trial in the Senate could take place, and two others were acquitted by the Senate. The trial of President Donald Trump concluded with the president being found not guilty. At the state level, Governor Rod Blagojevich of Illinois was impeached and unanimously removed from office by the Illinois Senate in 2009 for offenses including abuse of power. Institutional abuse Institutional abuse is the maltreatment of someone (often children or older adults) by a system of power. This can range from acts similar to home-based child abuse, such as neglect, physical and sexual abuse, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior. Impeachment of U.S. officials =James Peck= Federal Judge James H. Peck was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1830 on a charge of abuse of power. Peck had jailed a man for contempt of court after the man had publicly criticized him. The U.S. Senate acquitted him in 1831, with 21 voting guilty and 22 voting not guilty. =Charles Swayne= Federal Judge Charles Swayne was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1904. He was accused of filing false travel vouchers, improper use of private railroad cars, unlawfully imprisoning two attorneys for contempt, and living outside of his district. He was acquitted by the U.S. Senate in 1905. There was little doubt that Swayne was guilty of some of the offenses charged against him. Indeed, his counsel admitted as much, though calling the lapses \\"inadvertent.\\" The Senate, however, refused to convict Swayne because its members did not believe his actions amounted to \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\". =George English= Federal Judge George W. English was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1926, but resigned before his trial in the U.S. Senate could take place. One of the five articles of impeachment alleged \\"tyranny and oppression, and abuse of the powers of his office.\\" The House voted to impeach by a vote of 306 to 60, but the charges were dismissed following English's resignation. He had been accused of abusive treatment of attorneys and litigants appearing before him. =Richard Nixon= President Richard Nixon resigned from office after the House Judiciary Committee voted to approve articles of impeachment, but before the full House had a chance to vote on impeachment. Of the three articles of impeachment, Article II charged Nixon with abuse of power, alleging in part that: The article also cited five specific examples of alleged misconduct to substantiate this charge against the president. The vote on Article II was bipartisan, with 7 of the 17 Republicans joining all 21 Democrats on the committee in approving impeachment of a U.S. president for abuse of power. =Rod Blagojevich= Governor Rod Blagojevich of Illinois was impeached and removed from office in 2009, on charges of abuse of power and corruption. Blagojevich was accused of several \\"pay to play\\" schemes, including attempting \\"to obtain personal gain ... through the corrupt use\\" of his authority to fill a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate. The Illinois House of Representatives voted 114‚Äì1 (with three abstentions) to impeach Blagojevich for abuse of power,Vote on House Resolution 1671 to impeach Gov. Blagojevich. and the Illinois Senate voted 59‚Äì0 to remove him from office.Chicago Tribune, January 30, 2009, \\"Impeached Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich Has Been Removed From Office\\" by Ray Long and Rick Pearson. =Donald Trump= President Donald Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives on December 18, 2019. The votes for the charge of abuse of power in the House were 230 in favor, 197 against, and 1 present. Voting in favor were all but three House Democrats and one Independent, and voting against were all House Republicans and two Democrats; representative Tulsi Gabbard voted present. During his trial in the Senate on February 5, 2020, he was found not guilty. The votes for acquittal on the charge of abuse of power in the Senate were 48 against (45 Democratic senators, 2 Independent senators, one Republican senator), and 52 in favor (All Republicans). Of the two articles of impeachment, Article I alleges abuse of power.  Other examples  =Lois Lerner/IRS= Lois Lerner used her position as head of the Exempt Organizations Unit of the IRS to deny mainly conservative groups exempt status. In October 2017, the Trump Administration agreed to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of more than four hundred conservative nonprofit groups who claimed that they had been discriminated against by the Internal Revenue Service for an undisclosed amount described by plaintiffs' counsel as \\"very substantial.\\" The Trump Administration also agreed to settle a second lawsuit brought by forty-one conservative organizations with an apology and an admission that subjecting them to \\"heightened scrutiny and inordinate delays\\" was wrongful. =Joe Arpaio= In February 2010, Judge John Leonardo found that Arpaio \\"misused the power of his office to target members of the Board of Supervisors for criminal investigation\\". In 2008, a federal grand jury began an inquiry of Arpaio for abuse of power, in connection with an FBI investigation. On August 31, 2012, the Arizona US Attorney's office announced that it was \\"closing its investigation into allegations of criminal conduct\\" by Arpaio, without filing charges. Arpaio was investigated for politically motivated and \\"bogus\\" prosecutions, which a former US Attorney called \\"utterly unacceptable\\". Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon has called Arpaio's \\"long list\\" of questionable prosecutions \\"a reign of terror\\". =Fa Zheng= Fa Zheng, a Chinese man, was appointed as the Administrator (Â§™ÂÆà) of Shu commandery (ËúÄÈÉ°) and \\"General Who Spreads Martial Might\\" (ÊèöÊ≠¶Â∞áËªç) by Liu Bei.

During this period of time, he abused his power by taking personal revenge against those who offended him before and killing them without reason. Some officials approached Zhuge Liang, another of Liu Bei's key advisers, and urged him to report Fa Zheng's lawless behaviour to their lord and take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, \\"When our lord was in Gong'an (ÂÖ¨ÂÆâ), he was wary of Cao Cao's influence in the north and fearful of Sun Quan's presence in the east. Even in home territory he was afraid that Lady Sun might stir up trouble. He was in such a difficult situation at the time that he could neither advance nor retreat. Fa Xiaozhi supported and helped him so much, such that he is now able to fly high and no longer remain under others' influence. How can we stop Fa Zheng from behaving as he wishes?\\" Zhuge Liang was aware that Liu Bei favoured and trusted Fa Zheng, which was why he refused to intervene in this matter.(‰∏ÄÈ£°‰πãÂæ∑ÔºåÁùöÁú¶‰πãÊÄ®ÔºåÁÑ°‰∏çÂ†±Âæ©ÔºåÊìÖÊÆ∫ÊØÄÂÇ∑Â∑±ËÄÖÊï∏‰∫∫„ÄÇÊàñË¨ÇË´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ≥ïÊ≠£ÊñºËúÄÈÉ°Â§™Á∏±Ê©´ÔºåÂ∞áËªçÂÆúÂïü‰∏ªÂÖ¨ÔºåÊäëÂÖ∂Â®ÅÁ¶è„ÄÇ„Äç‰∫ÆËçÖÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏ªÂÖ¨‰πãÂú®ÂÖ¨ÂÆâ‰πüÔºåÂåóÁïèÊõπÂÖ¨‰πãÂΩäÔºåÊù±ÊÜöÂ≠´Ê¨ä‰πãÈÄºÔºåËøëÂâáÊáºÂ≠´Â§´‰∫∫ÁîüËÆäÊñºËÇòËÖã‰πã‰∏ãÔºõÁï∂ÊñØ‰πãÊôÇÔºåÈÄ≤ÈÄÄÁãºË∑ãÔºåÊ≥ïÂ≠ùÁõ¥ÁÇ∫‰πãËºîÁøºÔºå‰ª§ÁøªÁÑ∂Áø±ÁøîÔºå‰∏çÂèØÂæ©Âà∂ÔºåÂ¶Ç‰ΩïÁ¶ÅÊ≠¢Ê≥ïÊ≠£‰Ωø‰∏çÂæóË°åÂÖ∂ÊÑèÈÇ™ÔºÅ„ÄçÂàùÔºåÂ≠´Ê¨ä‰ª•Â¶πÂ¶ªÂÖà‰∏ªÔºåÂ¶πÊâçÊç∑ÂâõÁåõÔºåÊúâË´∏ÂÖÑ‰πãÈ¢®Ôºå‰æçÂ©¢ÁôæÈ§ò‰∫∫ÔºåÁöÜË¶™Âü∑ÂàÄ‰æçÁ´ãÔºåÂÖà‰∏ªÊØèÂÖ•ÔºåË°∑ÂøÉÂ∏∏ÂáúÂáúÔºõ‰∫ÆÂèàÁü•ÂÖà‰∏ªÈõÖÊÑõ‰ø°Ê≠£ÔºåÊïÖË®ÄÂ¶ÇÊ≠§„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 37. =Police officers= In dictatorial, corrupt, or weak states, police officers may carry out many criminal acts for the ruling regime with impunity. Individual officers, or sometimes whole units, can be corrupt or carry out various forms of police misconduct; this occasionally happens in many forces, but can be more common where police pay is very low unless supplemented by bribes. Police officers sometimes act with unwarranted brutality when they overreact to confrontational situations, to extract a confession from a person they may or may not genuinely suspect of being guilty, .

History Joseph Whitlock had set up his company making coaches and carriages in Holland Park, London in 1778. They must have been successful as by the start of the twentieth century they described themselves as \\"Coachbuilders to the Royal Family\\". =1900s= 1905 Whitlock-Aster In 1903 a move into the car business was made when they started to sell the Whitlock Century. They had not built this themselves however, it was a re-badged car from Century, a manufacturer in Willesden, London, but they may well have built its body. In 1904 the range was expanded with (probably) engines and chassis from the French Aster company again probably with Whitlock's own coachwork. Aster manufactured engines in Saint-Denis, Paris, in single, twin or four cylinder configurations, and in 1904 they also produced a chassis. A separate company was formed in 1905 called The Whitlock Automobile Company which continued to market the Whitlock-Aster cars which, although well received, could not have been a commercial success as the company closed down in 1906. Meanwhile, another coachbuilder had been operating in Liverpool founded in 1870 by Jo Lawton and called J A Lawton and Company. It also turned to car body making and in the early 1900s opened a London works run by William Lawton-Goodman, Jo Lawton's nephew. Lawton died in 1913 and left the company in his will to his brother, leaving William with nothing, so he started a new company, Lawton-Goodman Ltd, and took over the defunct name of Whitlock and moved to new premises in Slade Works, Cricklewood, north London. Two new models were announced, initially called Lawtons but rapidly changing to Whitlock. Before production could be established war broke out. =First World War= During the war years the company concentrated on building ambulances on both its own and other makers' chassis and fuselages for De Havilland DH4 aircraft. =1920s= In 1924, a new range of cars was announced still using bought in mechanical components. The smallest was the 11, 12 or 12/35 built until 1925 and using a Coventry Climax (or Coventry Simplex) engine of 1368 cc or an Anzani engine of 1496 cc. Larger was the 14, also called the 16/50, with a six-cylinder 1755 cc or 1991 cc Coventry Climax built from 1924 to 1926 and bigger still the 20/70 with 6-cylinder 2973 cc Meadows engine made from 1926 to 1930. The latter car had a radiator very reminiscent of their near neighbours Bentley. William Lawton-Goodman died in 1932, but his sons carried on the business, turning to commercial vehicle bodies but continuing some car body work. =Second World War= During the Second World War the company returned again to making ambulances. =Post-war= With peace in 1945, the company seems to have concentrated on making mobile shops and ice cream vans, continuing to the early 1980s, after which it concentrated on repairs. In 1991, the lease on Slade Works ran out and the company closed. One Whitlock car is known to survive.

Most countries have implemented measures to counter terrorism financing (CTF) often as part of their money laundering laws. Some countries and multinational organisations have created a list of organisations that they regard as terrorist organisations, though there is no consistency as to which organisations are designated as being terrorist by each country. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) has made recommendations to members relating to CTF. It has created a Blacklist and Greylist of countries that have not taken adequate CTF action. As of 24 October 2019, the FAFT blacklist (Call for action nations) only listed two countries for terrorism financing: North Korea and Iran; while the FATF greylist (Other monitored jurisdictions) had 12 countries: Pakistan (Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism), Bahamas, Botswana, Cambodia, Ghana, Iceland, Mongolia, Panama, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.FATF nations, Full member nations, Observer nations, Call for action nations (Blacklisted nations), Other monitored jurisdictions (greylisted nations), FATF, accessed 24 October 2019.Clear warning: FATF statement, Business recorder, 22 October 2019.The FATF tribulations, Business recorder, 23 October 2019. In general, the supply of funds to designated terrorist organisations is outlawed, though the enforcement varies. Initially the focus of CTF efforts was on non-profit organizations, unregistered money services businesses (MSBs) (including so called underground banking or ‚ÄòHawalas‚Äô) and the criminalisation of the act itself.  History  = After September 11 attacks = The United States Patriot Act, passed after the September 11 attacks in 2001, gives the US government anti-money laundering powers to monitor financial institutions. The Patriot Act has generated a great deal of controversy in the United States since its enactment. The United States has also collaborated with the United Nations and other countries to create the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. Many initiatives have stemmed from the USA PATRIOT Act such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which focuses specifically on money laundering and financial crimes. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 is a counter-terrorism measure intended to deny financing to terrorist organisations and individuals. Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, also known as USA PATRIOT Act, was also enacted in 2001. In 2009 the act aided in blocking around $20 million and another $280 million that came from State Sponsors of Terrorism. In 2020, Veit Buetterlin, who conducted investigations on-site in more than 20 countries and who was kidnapped in course of his work, explained in an interview with CNN that the fight against terrorism financing will be an ongoing challenge (‚Äúit‚Äôs actually impossible to defeat a concept‚Äù). He noted that the world‚Äôs top 10 terrorist organizations have an estimated annual budget of USD 3.6 billion.https://www.cnnmoney.ch/shows/living-markets/videos/fighting-war- against-terrorist-financing  Methods used for terrorism funding  A number of countries and multinational organisations maintain lists of organisations that they designate as terrorist organisations, though there is no consistency as to which organisations are so designated. In the United States, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains such a list. Financial transactions that benefit the designated terrorist organisations are usually outlawed. Designated terrorist organisations may adopt a variety of strategies to get past efforts to prevent such funding. For example, they may make multiple smaller-value transfers in an attempt to bypass scrutiny; or they may use people who have no criminal backgrounds to complete financial transactions to try to make fund transfers harder to track. These transactions may also be disguised as donations to charities or as gifts to family members. Countries are not able to combat terrorism on their own, as corporate actors are needed to scan financial transactions themselves. If corporate actors do not comply with the state then penalties or regulatory sanctions may be applied. Terrorists and terrorist organizations often use any resource of money they can have access to in order to fund themselves. This can range from the distribution of narcotics, black market oil, having businesses such as car dealerships, taxi companies, etc. ISIS is known to use black market oil distribution as a means of funding their terrorist activity. The internet is a growing modern form of terrorist finance as it is able to protect the anonymity that it can provide to the donor and recipient. Terrorist organizations use propaganda in order to rally up financial support from those who follow them. They are also able to find funds through criminal activity on the internet such as stealing online banking information from people who are not correlated to these terrorist organizations. Terrorist organizations also use the front of being a charity to finance themselves. Al- Qaeda is a known terrorist organization that has used the internet in order to finance their organization, as through this platform they are able to reach a wider audience. = Money laundering = Often linked in legislation and regulation, terrorism financing and money laundering are conceptual opposites. Money laundering is the process where cash raised from criminal activities is made to look legitimate for re-integration into the financial system, whereas terrorism financing cares little about the source of the funds, but it is what the funds are to be used for that defines its scope. An in-depth study of the symbiotic relationship between organised crime and terrorist organizations detected within the United States and other countries referred to as crime- terror nexus points has been published in the forensic literature.Perri, Frank S., Lichtenwald, Terrance G., and MacKenzie, Paula M. (2009). Evil Twins: The Crime-Terror Nexus. Forensic Examiner, 16-29. The Perri, Lichtenwald and MacKenzie article emphasizes the importance of multi-agency working groups and the tools that can be used to identify, infiltrate, and dismantle organizations operating along the crime-terror nexus points. Bulk cash smuggling and placement through cash-intensive businesses is one typology. They are now also moving monies through the new online payment systems. They also use trade linked schemes to launder monies. Nonetheless, the older systems have not given way. Terrorists also continue to move monies through MSBs/Hawalas, and through international ATM transactions. Charities also continue to be used in countries where controls are not so stringent. Said and Cherif Kouachi, before the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris, France in 2015, used transaction laundering to fund their activities. Examples included reselling counterfeit goods and drugs. > \\"This chain of funding shows a clear correlation between transaction > laundering and terrorism, using legitimate marketplaces to conduct illegal > activity (in this case, selling counterfeit shoes) and then using the > proceeds to launder money for terrorists.\\" = Preventing the funding of terrorism = AML and CTF both carry the notion of Know Your Customer (KYC), this entails financial organizations to have in person identification and to observe the lawfulness of the transaction in question. Although this methodology is not favoured by banks, lawyers or other professionals who are able to see the transaction of money or legal aid occurring, because of the business and client relationship that can be hurt through the process of personal identification. This can damage relationships between long term clients who need to prove their identity, and respected members of society do not want to be asked for personal identification every time. The FATF Blacklist (the Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories list) mechanism was used to coerce countries to bring about change. = Suspicious activity = Operation Green Quest, a US multi-agency task force established in October 2001 with the official purpose of countering terrorism financing considers the following patterns of activity as indicators of the collection and movement of funds that could be associated with terrorism financing: * Account transactions that are inconsistent with past deposits or withdrawals such as cash, cheques, wire transfers, etc. * Transactions involving a high volume of incoming or outgoing wire transfers, with no logical or apparent purpose that come from, go to, or transit through locations of concern, that is sanctioned countries, non-cooperative nations and sympathizer nations. * Unexplainable clearing or negotiation of third party cheques and their deposits in foreign bank accounts. * Structuring at multiple branches or the same branch with multiple activities. * Corporate layering, transfers between bank accounts of related entities or charities for no apparent reasons. * Wire transfers by charitable organisations to companies located in countries known to be bank or tax havens. * Lack of apparent fund raising activity, for example a lack of small cheques or typical donations associated with charitable bank deposits. * Using multiple accounts to collect funds that are then transferred to the same foreign beneficiaries * Transactions with no logical economic purpose, that is, no link between the activity of the organization and other parties involved in the transaction. * Overlapping corporate officers, bank signatories, or other identifiable similarities associated with addresses, references and financial activities. * Cash debiting schemes in which deposits in the US correlate directly with ATM withdrawals in countries of concern. Reverse transactions of this nature are also suspicious. * Issuing cheques, money orders or other financial instruments, often numbered sequentially, to the same person or business, or to a person or business whose name is spelled similarly. It would be difficult to determine by such activity alone whether the particular act was related to terrorism or to organized crime. For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorism financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail foreign exchange operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have police records, particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups. The funds may have moved through a state sponsor of terrorism or a country where there is a terrorism problem. A link with a Politically exposed person (PEP) may ultimately link up to a terrorism financing transaction. A charity may be a link in the transaction. Accounts (especially student) that only receive periodic deposits withdrawn via ATM over two months and are dormant at other periods could indicate that they are becoming active to prepare for an attack.  Nation specific actions  =Pakistan= As at 24 October 2019, Pakistan was on the FATF greylist for terrorism financing and has met only 5 of 27 action items, and it has been given four months to comply with the remaining action points for the prevention of terror financing. =Bahrain= Bahrain has been regularly accused of doing very little to prevent the flow of funds for the terrorism financing in other nations. Bahrain accepts Muslim Brotherhood affiliate Minbar as a legitimate political player.Qatar‚Äôs Links to Terrorism: The War of Narratives, Fair Observer, 21 October 2019. =Qatar= Qatar interacts with militants by financing US designated terrorist organisation Hamas and by allowing several designated terrorist units of Taliban to maintain their offices in Qatar. = Saudi Arabia = Saudi Arabia have been regularly accused of doing very little to prevent the flow of funds for terrorism financing in other nations. Saudi Arabia collaborates with the Muslim Brotherhood affiliate al-Islah in Yemen. Saudi Arabia has been pointed out as hypocrite as it too faces accusations of not doing enough to stop terrorism financing. Saudi Arabia has been keen on joining the FATF so as to have an easy access to global financial markets. However, a recent report by FATF highlighted serious deficiencies in Saudi Arabia's efforts to counter terrorism. Terrorism financing budding in Saudi Arabia became an important source of funding for al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. In a leaked classified memo, Hillary Clinton said that in 2009 the kingdom was a crucial source of funds to Sunni terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba. In 2019, the European Commission added Saudi Arabia, along with several other countries, to its blacklist list of states that have failed to control money laundering and terrorism financing. Saudi Arabia has been accused of not making an effort to control the huge amounts of money being transferred to Islamist extremists and terrorist groups. = United Arab Emirates = The United Arab Emirates had been accused of being a financial hub for terrorist organisations. The UAE banking system was found to be involved in the attacks on 11 September 2001 against the United States carried out by al-Qaeda. The 9/11 terrorists had bank accounts in the UAE. Executing the attack cost the terrorist group around $400,000‚Äì500,000, out of which $300,000 was transacted via one of the hijackers‚Äô bank accounts in the US. The movement of funds took place with the help of both public banking systems and the Al Qaeda established Hawala networks. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, in response to concerns that the UAE banking system had been used by 9/11 hijackers to launder funds, the UAE adopted legislation giving the Central Bank in 2002 the power to freeze suspect accounts for 7 days without prior legal authorisation. The report stated \\"banks have been advised to carefully monitor transactions passing through the UAE from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and are now subject to more stringent transaction and client reporting requirements.\\" The UAE government has since affirmed its stance and policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism financing. = Australia = Australian anti terrorism financing laws include: * Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth): ** section 102.6 (getting funds to, from or for a terrorist organisation) ** section 102.7 (providing support to a terrorist organisation) ** section 103.1 (financing terrorism) ** section 103.2 (financing a terrorist), and ** section 119.4(5) (giving or receiving goods and services to promote the commission of a foreign incursion offence). * Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 (Cth): ** section 20 (dealing with freezable assets), and ** section 21 (giving an asset to a proscribed person or entity). These offences sanction persons and entities under Australian and international law. The responsibility of prosecuting these offences in Australia rests with the Australian Federal Police, State police forces and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. =Germany= In July 2010, Germany outlawed the Internationale Humanit√§re Hilfsorganisation (IHH), saying it has used donations to support projects in Gaza that are related to Hamas, which is considered by the European Union to be a terrorist organization, while presenting their activities to donors as humanitarian help. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said, \\"Donations to so-called social welfare groups belonging to Hamas, such as the millions given by IHH, actually support the terror organization Hamas as a whole.\\" According to a research conducted by the Abba Eban Institute as part of an initiative called Janus Initiative, Hezbollah is financed through non-profit organizations such as the ‚ÄúOrphans Project Lebanon‚Äù, a German-based charity for Lebanese orphans. It found that it had been donating portions of its contributions to a foundation which finances the families of Hezbollah members who commit suicide bombings. The European Foundation for Democracy published that the ‚ÄúOrphans Project Lebanon‚Äù organization directly channels financial donations from Germany to the Lebanese Al-Shahid Association, which is part of the Hezbollah network and promotes suicide bombings in Lebanon, particularly among children. In Germany, financial donations to the Orphans Project Lebanon are tax-deductible and thus subsidized by the German State's tax policy.EFD Report: Hezbollah fundraising in Germany tax-deductible, European Foundation for Democracy, July 13, 2009 In 2018, an investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) called ‚ÄúOperation Cedar‚Äù led to the arrest of Hezbollah operatives involved in laundering millions of euros in South American drug money to Europe and Lebanon. One of the operatives arrested was Hassan Tarabolsi, a German citizen who manages a worldwide money laundering business. Tarabolsi represents the close connection between the criminal operation and the leaders of Hezbollah. =India= India has campaign for linking of the IMF's macroprudential regulation and lending policies with key provisions of FATF's anti-money laundering (AML) and countering financing of terrorism (CFT) to significantly enhance its IMF member nation's compliance on these issues which cause threat to the global economy. India also seeks to link these IMF policies with the secrecy jurisdictions, cyber-risks and tax havens.India Seeks Integration of Anti-money Laundering, Counter-terror Financing with IMF Lending Policies, News 18, 19 October 2019. =Spain= In February 2019, the Spanish Treasury, through the Commission for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Monetary Offences (SEPBLAC), published their strategy for preventing the financing of terrorism. = United Kingdom = In the UK, the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, put in place in 1989, helped to prevent the financing of terrorism. This was more so to help shut down the funding of the Republican paramilitary in Northern Ireland. Income sources for the Republic paramilitary came from gambling machines, cab companies and charitable donations and terrorism funding. =Supranational organizations= European Union European Union has undertaken several actions against money laundering and terror funding. This includes production of following reports and implementation of their corresponding recommendations: Supranational Risk Assessment Report (SNRA), Report on publicly known anti- money laundering cases involving EU banks, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) report, interconnection of central bank account registries.Fact Sheet: Commission assesses risks and implementation shortcomings in fight against money laundering and terrorist financing: Questions and Answers, European Commission, 24 July 2019.  United Nations  Article 2.1 of the 1999 Terrorist Financing Convention defines the crime of terrorist financing as the offense committed by \\"any person\\" who \\"by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and willfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out\\" an act \\"intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.\\"United Nations 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (Terrorist Financing Convention), art. 2.1 The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1373 after the 9/11 attacks. This outlined that states were not allowed to provide financing to terrorist organizations, allow safe havens to them and that information regarding terrorist groups had to be shared with other governments. A committee was formed in the United Nations that were in charge of gathering a list of organizations and people who had ties with terrorism or were suspected of terrorism whose financial accounts needed to be frozen and that no financial institutes would be able to do trade with them.  Evasive actions of terrorist organisations  = Al- Qassam Brigades appealing for Bitcoin = In January 2019, the military wing of Hamas, known as the al-Qassam Brigades, began a campaign to get supporters to donate USD. Soon after announcing its intention to crowdfund through Bitcoin, the al-Qassam Brigades provided a Bitcoin address to which donors could send funds and posted infographics and tutorials about Bitcoin on social media.

He is generally depicted as an Egyptian swordsman who is immortal due to an energy called the Quickening, unable to die unless beheaded. Ram√≠rez is notable for being the mentor and friend of Connor MacLeod, the main protagonist of the first three Highlander films. The movie Highlander II: The Quickening gave the character an alternate origin as a sorcerer from the planet Zeist who becomes immortal when exiled to Earth, while the director's cut of the same film said he was still an immortal native to Earth but one born during a lost age of advanced technology that existed before recorded history. Ram√≠rez was portrayed by Sean Connery in Highlander and Highlander II: The Quickening. He is mentioned but never seen in the live-action show Highlander: The Series. Other than James Bond, Ram√≠rez is the only character that Connery has played in more than one film. Fictional history Ram√≠rez's history is largely established by the 1986 movie Highlander and its original screenplay, which adds details that did not make it into the final cut of the film but are treated as canon by later tie- in media. Some details are later added by Highlander: The Series and Highlander III: The Sorcerer. The man who will be called Ram√≠rez is originally born in Egypt in 896 BCE and named Tak-Ne. He lives an average life until he is run down by an out of control cart in the streets of his home. After he revives from his fatal wounds and shows no sign of his injuries, Tak-Ne is banished by the fearful people of his home and wanders the Earth.Gregory Widen, Peter Bellwood, and Larry Ferguson, Highlander film screenplay (1985); J. T. Krul, Highlander: Way of the Sword comic book series (2008), Dynamite Entertainment, Issue #4, pp. 1-5. Ram√≠rez's ancient past is revealed in both sources, including his original Egyptian birth name. Tak-Ne learns he and other rare people were born with an energy called the Quickening that makes them invincible to age, disease, and injury after their First Death, connects them to nature, lets them sense each other, and prevents them from having children. They can only die if beheaded, and immortals can absorb more Quickening energy by killing another of their own kind. For this reason, some hunt each other in \\"the Game\\", where the main rule is to never fight on holy ground. Tak-Ne is told that one day when just a few are left, those immortals will be drawn to a faraway land and fight in the Gathering, the final battle for the Prize: enough power to enslave humanity. According to the Game, \\"In the end, there can be only one.\\" Determined that a corrupt person must not win the Prize, Tak-Ne battles and kills several evil immortals throughout history. One enemy he is never able to defeat is the murderous immortal known as the Kurgan (Clancy Brown). He and Tak-Ne battle each other in Babylonia, Greece, and ancient China. The encounter each other during the Battle of Plataea, when Tak-Ne fights alongside the Spartans. During this fight, Tak-Ne shatters the Kurgan's sword.Highlander film screenplay; Highlander: Way of the Sword comic book series (2008), Issue #3, pp. 2-6. Tak-Ne marries three different times during his life. In Japan, less than six centuries before the beginning of the Common Era, he marries Shakiko, a Japanese princess. Shakiko's father, a great swordsmith named Masamune, gives Ram√≠rez a katana in 592 BC. The sword is unique for the time, forged with a technique that Japan will not see again until the Middle Ages. After Shakiko dies, Ram√≠rez is emotionally shattered and decides he will not form such connections with mortals again. He likewise advises other immortals against forming romantic connections with mortals.Highlander (1986) By the 15th century, Tak-Ne lives in Spain under the name Juan S√°nchez-Villalobos Ram√≠rez and spends time working as the Chief Metallurgist to King Charles V. Ram√≠rez leaves for the Scottish Highlands when he learns the Kurgan is there. After he arrives, he discovers the Kurgan targeted Connor MacLeod, a young Highlander who was banished from his clan after he inexplicably recovered from death in the battlefield. Ram√≠rez tracks down MacLeod and the man's wife Heather, explaining the secrets of immortality and the Game. Wishing to make sure MacLeod can defend himself and hoping he will be an ally against evil such as the Kurgan, Ram√≠rez trains the Highlander for over a year. In 1542, while Connor is away hunting, the Kurgan finds Ram√≠rez and Heather. A duel ensues and Ram√≠rez nearly decapitates his foe. Though he fails, the Kurgan will carry the scar from the wound and a damaged voice for the rest of his immortal life. The Kurgan then kills Ram√≠rez, bringing an end to their centuries-long conflict, and leaves. Connor buries Ram√≠rez in Glencoe, near the home he shares with Heather. Decades later Heather dies of old age. Connor leaves Scotland to wander the Earth, now adopting Ram√≠rez's sword as his own. In 1985, the Gathering takes place and the last two immortals are Connor and the Kurgan. The Highlander wins, earning the Prize and finally avenging Ram√≠rez's death centuries before.Highlander (1986) =Expanded history= The 1994 film Highlander III: The Sorcerer, also called Highlander: The Final Dimension, states that during his time in Japan, Ram√≠rez learns how to use his new katana from the immortal sorcerer named Nakano (portrayed by Mako Iwamatsu). The TV spin-off Highlander: The Series presents an alternate timeline where many more immortals exist on Earth. As a result, the events of the first film still occur in this timeline but Connor's victory over the Kurgan in 1985 is not the final battle and the Prize has yet to be won. The series makes no reference to Highlander III: The Sorcerer but does not contradict it. The series follows the adventures of Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), another immortal from the Clan MacLeod born decades after Connor's banishment. During the fifth season, Ram√≠rez is mentioned in two different episodes and more of his history is revealed. According to Highlander: The Series, soon after being banished from his home in Egypt, Tak- Ne meets and is mentored by Tjanefer, an immortal born in Troy in the 12th century BCE who later adopts the name Graham Ashe.Highlander: The Series - Season 5, \\"The End of Innocence\\" (1996) Another episode says that during his time in Spain, Ram√≠rez trains Otavio Consone, a Spanish noble who discovers he is immortal in 1481.Highlander: The Series - Season 5, \\"Duende\\" (1997) = Alternate History (Highlander II: The Quickening) = The film Highlander II: The Quickening contradicts several parts of the original film, introducing an alien-based origin story for all the immortals and a new history for Ram√≠rez. It is now said that Ram√≠rez and Connor MacLeod were originally mortal men born on the planet Zeist, around the time of Earth's 16th century. They live as revolutionaries against the world's corrupt leadership and General Katana. Ram√≠rez is depicted as a sorcerer and the Quickening is now said to be a \\"kind of\\" magic he uses to create a bond between him and MacLeod that not even death can break. Captured by Katana's forces, Ram√≠rez, MacLeod and the other prisoners are exiled to Earth, somehow becoming immortal in the process. They are told that their unending exile will end after they battle each other and only one remains. The final survivor will become mortal and can choose to remain on Earth to live out their days or return to Zeist with amnesty. The film then takes place in 2024 where Connor MacLeod has mortal since becoming the final winner. Not willing to risk he may ever return to Zeist, Katana sends assassins who become immortal as they arrive on Earth. MacLeod kills them, regaining his immortality and youth in the process. Using the magic of the Quickening, MacLeod summons Ram√≠rez back from death. The two fight alongside each other again, then Ram√≠rez sacrifices his life to allow MacLeod a chance to escape a death trap. In 2000, a director's cut was released called Highlander II: Renegade Version. In this cut, all references to Zeist are removed. Earth's immortals are now said not to be aliens but immortals who were born in an ancient civilization lost before recorded history. Ram√≠rez and MacLeod were still depicted as revolutionaries against Katana, said to be another immortal, and they are still seen forging a bond through magic (though the magic is no longer referred to as the Quickening). When they are captured by Katana, the trial scene has replacement dialogue to explain that the immortal criminals will be exiled into the far future. As before, they will be forced to fight each other for the chance to either become mortal or return to their rightful home in the distant past, their crimes pardoned. The film Highlander III: The Sorcerer (1994), also called Highlander: The Final Dimension, acts as an alternate sequel to the original film and removes Highlander II from its continuity. Similarly, Highlander II cannot exist in the same continuity as Highlander: The Series.  Comic Books  Dynamite Entertainment published a comic book mini-series acting as a prequel to the original Highlander film. The mini-series, entitled Highlander: The Way of the Sword, reveals that the sword Masamune gave to Ram√≠rez was originally meant for his adopted son Ren. Ren later learns he too is immortal and carries a grudge against Ram√≠rez for the next 2,500 years.J. T. Krul, Highlander: Way of the Sword comic book series (2008), Issue #3, pp. 3-4. Ren also trains with the immortal sorcerer Nakano and learns the art of metallurgy. Animated series continuity Highlander: The Animated Series (1994-1996) takes place in an alternate timeline from the films in the 27th century. A character named Don Vicente Marino Ram√≠rez (Benedict Campbell) is an ally of Connor's in the 20th century. He is different than the character Sean Connery portrayed in the film but shares a similar appearance. After a meteorite devastates much of the planet and leads to the downfall of society, this version of Ram√≠rez joins other immortals in taking a vow of non-violence, deciding to help and guide humanity rather than continue the Game. An immortal named Kortan refuses to take this vow and rules much of Earth in the 27th century. His rule is defied by young immortal Quentin MacLeod, last of the Clan MacLeod. Don Vicente Marino Ram√≠rez acts as Quentin's mentor. In other media * Robot Chicken features a parody of Highlander, which is also mentioned at the beginning of the skit with Ram√≠rez saying, \\"As you may have noticed, this is a Highlander parody.\\" In place of Connor, he is training Lindsay Lohan and in place of the Kurgan is Hilary Duff. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore. * The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack episode \\"Highlandlubber\\", features a parody of Ram√≠rez partially based on Ponce de Le√≥n who is an escaped insane asylum inmate who thinks Captain K'nuckles is a fellow Immortal and has him join his mad adventures, the episode concluding with him jumping into a volcano. *In the book Ready Player One, the protagonist Parzival delays revealing his name to another character by jokingly introducing himself himself as Ram√≠rez. *In Paradox Development Studio's newest expansion for the computer game Crusader Kings II, the player can encounter a character named Ram√≠rez, a 1500 year old Spanish-Scotsman who attempts to end your life in personal combat via swordfight.

History The plantation traces its formation to three land grants of 500, 500 and from King George III to Thomas Hepworth, in 1710, 1712 and 1711. The plantation was named \\"Litchfield\\" by Peter Simon, with the first reported statement of its existence occurring in his will. The original mansion or \\"Plantation House\\" was built in 1740. The most celebrated owner of the plantation was the Tucker Family of Georgetown, South Carolina. The Tucker family originally came to South Carolina from Bermuda. Daniel Tucker was a politician and had three sons. The eldest, John Tucker eventually inherited the plantation and perfected growing methods for rice on the property. By 1850 Litchfield Plantation was producing one million pounds of rice per year. John had 9 sons by 4 wives. Upon the death of John Tucker ownership passed to his son Dr. Henry Massingberd Tucker. Dr. Tucker served as a volunteer with the Confederate Army for four years during the American Civil War. He was also a staunch Episcopalian and when a new church was built had the old All Saints Church dismantled and moved to his property. In order to compel church attendance by the slaves who worked the plantation Dr. Tucker withheld weekly rations of food and tobacco from those slaves who did not attend services. Dr. Tucker was also a sportsman and won many tournaments at the Georgetown Rifle Club. List of owners (chronological) Peter Simon, circa 1794 John Simon, circa 1794 (acquired upon the death of Peter Simon and sold to Daniel Tucker prior to 1796) Daniel Tucker, circa 1794-1797 John Hyrne Tucker, 1797-1859 Dr. Henry Massingberd Tucker, 1859-1897 Breslauer, Lachicotte and Company, 1897-1901 Louis Claude Lachicotte, 1901-1904 Col.

Miller, Jr., Howard Hinman, Jr., 1957-1966 Louise Price Parsons, 1966 Litchfield Plantation Company Slavery Little is recorded of the history of slavery at Litchfield plantation, although it is established by many sources that slaves were used to work the plantation. One of the distinguishing characteristics of Litchfield plantation is the existence of a cemetery utilized by slaves of Litchfield plantation and their descendants. According to an archaeological investigation performed by Brockington and Associates in 1989 the cemetery holds approximately 150 possible graves. Only 2 of these graves are marked, with dates in 1888 and 1920. Ghost stories Like much of the low country, Litchfield Plantation boasts a number of ghost stories. These stories center around Dr. Henry Massingberd Tucker. One of the stories involves the ghost of Dr. Tucker returning to the plantation on horseback after performing a midnight house call. It has been anecdotally reported that he rings the bell at the entrance gate to alert the stable hands that he had returned, followed by the sound of a horse trotting down the main lane. The other stories involve the ghost of Dr. Tucker appearing in the plantation house and the sound of a person walking on the back staircase. Today Litchfield Plantation is currently in the process of being developed as a master-planned residential community. The original Mansion is now used as a Country Inn, and the original site of the stables is now occupied by The Carriage House Club, a private dining club. The plantation has given its name to the nearby community of Litchfield Beach.

Both the Spysong Dynasty and the Citadel of Assassins have lost associates at the castle and search for an honest account of the events that took place. Readers are finally told the dark truth behind both Entreri and Jarlaxle's childhoods, as well as a glimpse into the past of their dwarf associate Athrogate. As Entreri's past is revealed and he becomes further involved with the passionate Calihye, a different side of the mysterious assassin is finally shown. Plot summary In the final episode of this series, Jarlaxle and Entreri find themselves having to answer for their actions at Zhengyi's construct. Both the Spysong network and the Citadel of Assassins have lost associates at the castle and search for a hero. Artemis Entreri finds himself uncharacteristically falling in love with the half-elf Calihye, the result of a magical flute given to him by Jarlaxle which forces the owner into a heightened emotional state. Entreri is betrayed by Calihye who still blames him for the death of Parissus. She attempts to stab him in the heart with a dagger while making love to him but is foiled by a kinetic barrier conjured by Kimmuriel. Jarlaxle seizes control of Castle Perilous and is summarily attacked by an army led by King Gareth himself. He immediately surrenders and confesses that he made an open bid for power against the king in order to unite the people of Palishchuk under Gareth's banner, willingly playing the part of a common enemy. Despite the queen's insistence that Entreri and Jarlaxle be executed for treason, they are permitted, along with Athrogate, to leave the city with his life with the promise that they will never again enter the kingdom. The trio head for Memnon, Entreri finally deciding to face his inner demons and confront the city of his birth. Entreri soon discovers that the city is in the iron grip of a corrupt high priest who impoverishes the people through fear demanding they pay indulgences in exchange for the promise that their dead children will go to a pleasant afterlife. Entreri learns that the high priest knew his mother intimately and might even be his biological father. Disgusted by the obscene luxury of the priest's palace and the resulting destitution of the city's non- clerical inhabitants, Entreri kills the high priest and orders the palace's second-in-command, on penalty of a similar fate as his superior, to redistribute the acquired riches among those who need it. In the end, Jarlaxle admits that he gave Entreri the flute in the hope that, in embracing emotions he'd suppressed since his traumatic childhood, he would rediscover his heart and find a purpose in life other than power. The story ends with Jarlaxle and Entreri parting ways, the latter saying he wants nothing to do with him ever again.

He was relieved of his duties as Glentoran manager on Saturday 17 October 2015. Despite winning two Irish Cups in three years, the club highlighted deteriorating league positions and performances as the main reason for his dismissal. Early life Patterson, from the Bruslee Way/Pinkerton Walk area of the New Lodge Road, was brought up in Belfast. He now lives in Glengormley. In the 1970s, he played midfield for Newington Football Club in the Down and Connor League, along with John McAuley, Gary Higgins and Paddy McCoy, all of whom were later to emulate him by playing for Irish League teams. Patterson went on to have a spell playing intermediate football for Chimney Corner under former Cliftonville boss Lawrence Stitt. Cliftonville Patterson took temporary charge of The Reds on 22 July 2005, when former manager Liam Beckett walked out, and was officially confirmed as Cliftonville boss on 11 October 2006. He had been assistant manager the previous season. Patterson starred for the club during his playing days and was also a successful manager of the reserve side, Cliftonville Olympic. = 2005/2006 Season = In his first season in charge of the Cliftonville F.C. Senior side, Patterson led his side to a fifth-place finish, an improvement on the 11th place in the previous year. The season ended in controversy, however, after a registration error involving fellow Irish League side Coleraine F.C.. Had Cliftonville been awarded the extra three points due to this registration error, they would have climbed above Dungannon Swifts F.C. into fourth place and qualification for the UEFA Intertoto Cup the following season. Nevertheless, coming fifth was the club's best performance since winning the title in 1998. The team's biggest victory that season was an 8‚Äì1 hammering of Armagh City F.C. During the January transfer window, Patterson re-signed two former players, Chris Scannell, who had been away in Australia for just over a year, and Barry Johnston, from Coleraine. = 2006/2007 Season = In preparation for his second year in charge, Patterson signed a number of influential players. Defenders David McAlinden, the son of a Cliftonville legend, arrived from Glenavon F.C., and Barry Holland joined his brother Mark after leaving Bangor F.C.. In addition, Goalkeeper John Connolly returned for his second spell at Solitude. Patterson's second season in the job proved even more successful than the first. After the disappointment of losing the CIS Cup final 1‚Äì0 to city rivals Glentoran F.C., his side went on to win the County Antrim Shield in January 2007 by defeating Lisburn Distillery F.C. 2‚Äì1 in the final. Both goals were scored by Mark Holland. Patterson also signed Vincent Sweeney from Limavady United F.C. and Daniel Lyons on loan from Donegal Celtic F.C.. However John O'Loughlin (Finn Harps F.C.) and Conor Downey (Linfield F.C.) both left the club. Patterson's side also reached the semi-final of the Irish Cup but lost a penalty shootout to Dungannon Swifts. Cliftonville finished third in the league, narrowly missing out on second place, but nevertheless qualifying for the Intertoto Cup and the Setanta Cup for the following season. = 2007/2008 Season = Patterson wasted little time in preparing for Europe. With the first leg of the UEFA Intertoto Cup due to be played on 23 June 2007 against Latvian side Dinaburg FC, he signed Francis Murphy from Lisburn Distillery and Kieran O'Connor from Armagh City, and made Daniel Lyons permanent signing. Became the first Cliftonville manager to win a European tie. Cliftonville's performances in the majority of the season had made them genuine title contenders, however a poor run of form towards the end of the campaign ended their hopes of winning the biggest prize in local football. The Reds ended the league campaign in third position fourteen points adrift of Champions Linfield. = 2008/2009 Season = During the 2008/2009 campaign Cliftonville struggled in terms of their league performance but finished strongly to secure a top 6 finish. They won the County Antrim Shield and reached the Irish Cup final, 30 years since their previous victory in the competition. Alas it was not to be a victorious occasion with the Reds losing out to their near neighbours Crusaders FC, 1‚Äì0 who had waited 41 years to taste Irish Cup Success. It was a bitter pill for the Reds to swallow, not only losing but to lose to their near neighbours made the occasion heart breaking for the Red Army. Patterson was sacked in April 2011 . Glentoran Patterson returned to Irish League football after being appointed manager of East Belfast club Glentoran on 22 February 2012. = 2011/2012 = Patterson was appointed manager after the resignation of Scott Young. Glentoran finished sixth in the table later that season. = 2012/2013 = Patterson soon made changes to the squad, he sold a few players, including Leon Knight and Aidan O'Kane. Patterson then brought in new faces, one of them was Jay Magee from Glenavon. Glentoran kicked off the new season with a 3‚Äì1 win over Donegal Celtic, and finished it with a convincing 3‚Äì1 victory over his former club Cliftonville in the Irish Cup final.

The Longhorn Ballroom is a music venue and country western dance hall in Dallas, Texas (USA). It was known in the early 1950s as Bob Wills' Ranch House when the large ballroom was built and operated by O.L. Nelms, an eccentric Dallas millionaire, for his close friend, western swing bandleader Bob Wills. When Wills left, O.L. Nelms leased the sprawling dance club to Jack Ruby who later killed Lee Harvey Oswald, John F. Kennedy's accused assassin. O.L. Nelms then sold the property to his close friend and business partner Dewey Groom. On January 10, 1978 it achieved brief infamy in national music circles when the Sex Pistols appeared there and during their performance taunted the audience, resulting in a woman head-butting Sid Vicious. Before the Sex Pistols, the venue hosted mainly country music artists including Charley Pride, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Ray Price, Conway Twitty, Bob Wills, Loretta Lynn, Hank Thompson, Willie Nelson and Patsy Montana. A famous photo that often circulates on the internet shows the venue's marquee advertising both the Sex Pistols concert and a Merle Haggard concert the following night. The Bob Wills concert album, \\"The Longhorn Recordings\\" featuring the music of Bob Wills and his steel guitar player Gene Crownover was recorded in the early Sixties at Longhorn Ballroom. One of the two music videos for Aerosmith's 1989 single \\"What It Takes\\" was filmed at the Longhorn Ballroom. The Longhorn Ballroom returned to brief infamy in 1991, when 2 Live Crew refused to go on stage for a scheduled show, resulting in fights among their fans and police. Dallas soul stalwart Johnnie Taylor released a live video filmed at the Longhorn in 1997. Bobby Patterson, who claims in the introduction to his KKDA radio show to be \\"able to leap the Longhorn Ballroom in a single bound,\\" recorded a live album there in 2002. From October 1996 to February 2017 it was owned and operated by Raul Ramirez who also operates the restaurant Raul's Corral Mexican Restaurant adjacent to the ballroom. The current owner of the Longhorn Ballroom is Jay LaFrance who has plans to restore it. References * Noel E.

It has primarily been used by workers in areas where air conditioning systems cannot be easily installed, such as tunnels and underground construction sites. Air-cooled clothing on the market does not operate by actually cooling down the air, as a room AC unit does. Instead, it increases the natural body cooling of the wearer by blowing air and sometimes water vapor around the body, decreasing skin temperature by the evaporation of sweat and vapor. Patents for air cooled clothing have been around for years, but few products have actually made it to market. Hiroshi Ichigawa, a former Sony engineer spent 6 years to develop Kuchofuku, or \\"air-conditioned clothing\\" and launched his company in 2004 to manufacture and sell it. He first developed the water cooling system, but changed it to the air cooling system later because it was too uncomfortable to feel wet cloth. Another company that brought air conditioned shirts to market is Octocool, which is an online distributor of air cooled clothes. Attached to the clothing are two lightweight fans that help draw in air and help vaporize sweat. The fans, attached to the back of the clothing near the waist, are about 10 cm wide and run on rechargeable lithium ion batteries that last between 8.5 and 59 hours depending on the speed of the fan. One advantage of air-cooled clothing is that it requires much less energy to cool people down than to cool down their entire environment. For instance, an air cooled shirt uses 4,400 mAh of power for 8.5 hours on the fastest fan setting, while an average central air conditioning unit uses 3000 to 5000 watts of power. In some cases, the purpose of air-conditioning is not to cool down the objects in the room, but the people. Directly ventilating clothing is therefore far more efficient. A 2012 New York Times articleRelief in Every Window, but Global Worry Too June 20, 2012 The New York Times reported that gases commonly used in air conditioning absorb some 2,100 times more infrared radiation per ton than carbon dioxide, and due partly to increasing use of air conditioning in the developing world (particularly in tropical areas like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, and southern China), air conditioning is projected to contribute to some 27% of the overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Although there are some ideas for room air conditioning units that do not significantly contribute to producing greenhouse gases, none of those options are yet on the market.

Location and extent alt=22nd District: Jhargram ; 23rd District: Paschim Bardhaman West Bengal is on the eastern bottleneck of India, stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. It lies between 85 degree 50 minutes and 89 degree 50 minutes east longitude, and 21 degrees 25 minutes and 27 degrees 13 minutes north latitude. The state has a total area of . With Bangladesh, which lies on its eastern border, the state forms the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal. To its northeast lies the states of Assam and Sikkim and the country Bhutan, and to its southwest, the state of Orissa. To the west it borders the state of Jharkhand and Bihar, and to the northwest, Nepal. The capital of the state is Kolkata, the third-largest urban agglomeration and the seventh-largest city in India. Political geography There are 23 districts and 5 divisions in West Bengal. The Burdwan Division consists of Paschim Bardhaman, Purba Bardhaman, Birbhum, and Hooghly, Medinipur Division consists of Purba Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, Jhargram, Bankura and Purulia, the Jalpaiguri Division consists of Alipurduar, Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, and Kalimpong, the Malda Division consists of Uttar Dinajpur, Dakshin Dinajpur, Murshidabad and Malda, and the Presidency Division consists of Kolkata, Nadia, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and Howrah. Each district is governed by a district collector or district magistrate, appointed either by the Indian Administrative Service or the West Bengal Civil Service. Each district is subdivided into Sub-Divisions, governed by a sub-divisional magistrate, and again into Blocks. Blocks consists of panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities Often the districts north of the Ganges i.e., Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur and Malda are together termed as North Bengal. The capital and largest city of the state is Kolkata ‚Äì the third-largest urban agglomeration and the seventh- largest city in India.Asansol is the second largest city & urban agglomeration in West Bengal after Kolkata. Siliguri is an economically important city, strategically located in the northeastern Siliguri Corridor (Chicken's Neck) of India. Other major cities and towns in West Bengal are Howrah, Durgapur, Raniganj, Haldia, Jalpaiguri, Kharagpur, Burdwan, Darjeeling, Midnapore, and Malda. Landforms =Darjeeling Himalayan hill region= Kanchenjungha from Sandakphu A tea garden in Dooars with the background of the Himalayas. Susunia hill Shankarpur beach near Digha is a part of this coastal plain A river in Sunderbans Ganges River Delta, Bangladesh and India Darjeeling Himalayan hill region is situated on the north-western side of the state. This region belongs to the Eastern Himalaya range. The entire Darjeeling district except the Siliguri subdivision and a narrow northern part of Jalpaiguri district constitutes the region. It starts abruptly from the Terai region. The deep gorge of Teesta River, which runs from north to south has divided this mountainous region into two parts: the Singalila range and the Darjeeling range. The Singalila range is located along the border of Darjeeling and Nepal; it has four important peaks ‚Äì Sandakfu, Falut, Sabargram and Tonglu. Among the Himalayan ranges of this region, Singalila range hosts Sandakfu which at is the highest point of West Bengal.Also to mention Sandakfu & Phalut are the only place in West Bengal from where Mt. Everest is visible. Two high peaks, Tiger Hill and Ghoom are seen near the town of Darjeeling. Many ranges branch off in different directions from Tiger Hill. Durpindara is an important mountain in the eastern part of the mountainous region. A few hills also occur in the Terai or Dooars region at the foot of the Himalayas. Some remnants of the Siwaliks can be seen in the Jalpaiguri district, where they are known as the Buxa-Jayanti Hills. =Terai region= The ‚Äò‚ÄòTerai‚Äô‚Äô (\\"moist land\\") is a belt of marshy grasslands, savannas, and forests at the base of the Himalaya range stretching southwards to about 38 km. Above the Terai belt lies the Bhabar, a forested belt of rock, gravel, and soil eroded from the Himalayas. The Terai zone is composed of alternate layers of clay and sand, with a high water table that creates many springs and wetlands. The Terai zone is inundated yearly by the monsoon-swollen rivers of the Himalaya. The Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands is an ecoregion that stretches across the middle of the Terai belt. The Terai-Duar savanna and wetlands are a mosaic of tall grasslands, savannas and evergreen and deciduous forests. The Terai and Dooars region politically constitute the plains of Darjeeling District, whole of Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar district and upper region of Cooch Behar District in West Bengal. The slope of the land is gentle, from north to south. The general height of the land is 80 to 100 m. The entire region is made up of sand, gravel and pebbles laid down by the Himalayan rivers like the Teesta, Torsa, Raidak, Jaldhaka, Sankosh and several other small rivulets. The Teesta has divided the area into two parts- the western part is known as the Terai whereas the eastern part is known as the Dooars or Duars. The Dooars region can be further subdivided into the Siliguri or Western Dooars, the middle or Jalpaiguri Dooars and the eastern or Alipur Dooars. =North Bengal plains= North Bengal plain start from the south of Terai region and continues up to the left bank of the Ganges. The southern parts of the district Jalpaiguri, North Dinajpur baring some extreme northern regions, South Dinajpur, Malda, Alipurduar and southern part of Cooch Behar districts constitute this geographical region. The narrow land mass in the North Dinajpur district is known as Mahananda Corridor. This corridor runs north to south joining Malda with the plains of Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar. The entire part of North and South Dinajpur is silt laden plain. Mahananda River divides the district of Malda into two parts. The eastern part consists of undulating plains and some tilas and is made up of old alluvium and is a part of the Ganges delta. It is also known as Barind or Barendrabhumi. In contrast to the eastern part, the western part is made up of new alluvium and in this part River Kalindi joins the Mahananda River. The part of Malda lying to the north of river Kalindi is known as tal. This is a lowland and covered with swamps and beels (small water bodies). Whereas the area south of the Kalindi is a very fertile land and is known as diara. The plain in the south of Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar district is also made of new alluvium deposited by numerous rivers like the Teesta, Torsa, Raidak, Jaldhaka, Sankosh, Balason, Punarbhaba, Atrai and several other small rivulets. =Rarh region= Rarh is the region that intervenes between the Vajjabhumi and the Ganges Delta. Parts of the districts Murshidabad, Birbhum, Bankura, Purba Bardhaman, Paschim Bardhaman, Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur constitute this region. The region is about 50 to 100 m above the sea level. This region is believed to be created from the soil from the Deccan plateau. The area is formed by the silt brought by the tributaries of Bhagirathi, Mayurakshi River, Ajay River, Damodar and Rupnarayan River which flow over the western plateau region made up of laterite soil make the soil of the area red in colour. The land slope is from west to the south-east and formation of natural levees along the river banks is a common phenomenon. =Coastal plain= A small coastal region is on the extreme south of the state. A part of the district of Purba Medinipur along the Bay of Bengal constitutes the coastal plain. This emergent coastal plain is made up of sand and mud deposited by rivers and by wind. Parallel to the coast are colonies of sand dunes and marshy areas. The Digha dune lies nearest to the Bay of Bengal while the Kanthi dune is the farthest from it. In some areas dunes occur at a distance of 15‚Äì16 km from the coast and are 11‚Äì12 m high. =Sunderbans= The Sundarbans delta is the largest mangrove forest in the world situated in the South 24 Parganas district. It lies at the mouth of the Ganges and is spread across areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. The Bangladeshi and Indian portions of the jungle are listed in the UNESCO world heritage list separately as the Sundarbans and Sundarbans National Park respectively, though they are parts of the same forest. The Sundarbans are intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The general average height of the area is 10 m. This area has been created by deposition of silt by its numerous rivers namely, Hoogly, Matla River, Jamira River, Gosaba River, Saptamukhi River, Haribhanga River and their tributaries. The formation of the delta is an ongoing process and new bars and islands are being created along the rivers and at the river mouth. A large section of the area remains under water during incoming times. The area is known for its wide range of fauna. The most famous among these is the royal Bengal tiger, but numerous species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes also inhabit it. It is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. =Western plateau and high lands= The Western plateau and highlands forms the eastern fringes of the Chota Nagpur Plateau and is made up of igneous rocks of the Archaean era as well as coal-bearing mudstone and quartzite rocks of Carboniferous period. The western part of Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum, Bardhaman and Paschim Medinipur district constitutes this area. Because of long and continuous erosion, the whole region has been transformed into an undulating peneplain. This area is interspersed by small monadnocks locally known as tila. Some of the important hills in the area include Ajodhya Hills (677 m), Panchet (643 m) and Baghmundi of Purulia, Biharinath (452 m) and Susunia (442 m) of Bankura. The area has a slope from the west to the east. The altitude in the area ranges from 500 to 100 m. Gorgaburu in the Ayodhya Hills (677 m) is the highest point in the region. =Ganges delta= The Ganges delta consists of the whole of Nadia, Kolkata, North 24 Parganas, and South 24 Parganas districts and the Eastern half of Murshidabad district. River Ganges passes through this vast area and divides into three distinct parts ‚Äì the old delta, the mature delta and the active delta. The old delta consists of the districts of Murshidabad and Nadia. The formation of delta is complete and the rivers here are heavily silted and many have even dried up in due course of time. Silted rivers, swamps, beels and oxbow lakes forms the area. This area is also known as Bagri region. The districts of Kolkata and North 24 Parganas form mature delta region. The rivers are slow and meandering and frequently shift their courses. Swamps, beels and oxbow lakes characterises the scenery. The district of South 24 Parganas is known to be the active delta of the Ganges, where the formation of delta is still an ongoing process. Agro-climatic groups Agriculture is leading occupation in the state. Shown here are freshly sown saplings of paddy; in the background are stacks of jute sticks Depending on soil and climate variations, West Bengal can be divided into six broad divisions: *The hill region in the north *The terai and Teesta alluvial region of North Bengal *The laterectic, red and gravely undulating region in the west *The coastal alluvial region in the south *The gangetic alluvial region in the east *The Vindhya alluvial region in the centre Rivers Hooghly River viewed over the town of Bally, Howrah. National Highway 31A winds along the banks of the Teesta River near Kalimpong, in the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region. Ganges enters West Bengal near Rajmahal and then flows in a south-easterly direction. It divides into two near north of Dhulian in Murshidabad district. One branch enters Bangladesh as the Padma or P√¥dda, while the other flows through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi and Hooghly River in a southern direction. The Bhagirathi-Hoogly is the main river in West Bengal which flows past some of the important cities like Murshidabad, Baharampur, Nabadwip, Chinsura, Chandannagar, Srirampur, Howrah, Kolkata, Diamond Harbour and Haldia. It empties its water into Bay of Bengal near Sagar Island in the South 24 Parganas. The Mayurakshi, Ajay, Damodar, Kangsabati, Rupnarayan and their tributaries which rise in the Western plateau and high lands flow eastwards through the different districts of West Bengal and joins the Bhagirathi on the right bank. The Mayurakshi, which is fed by tributaries Brahmani, Dwarka, Bakreshwar and Kopai joins the Bhagirathi near Kandi, Murshidabad, the Ajay, which rises in the hills of Bihar, joined by the Kunur, flows down the plateau fringe, marking the boundary between Bardhaman and Birbhum districts joins it near Katwa and Damodar, with its small meandering distributaries, small streams, Khari, Banka and Behula joins the Bhagirathi near Uluberia. The Damodar is known as the sorrow of Bengal, is now controlled by making the Damodar Valley Project. The Dwarakeswar and Shilabati rivers join to form Rupnarayan and the Kangsabati and Keleghai rivers join to form the Haldi. The Rupnarayan and Haldi fall into the Bhagirathi in the East Midnapure district. The Subarnarekha River after flowing for a short distance in West Bengal reenters into Orissa. These rivers carry with them plenty of water thus keeping the Bhagirathi river submerged with water throughout the year. The rivers along with water carry silt and sand eroded from the western plateaus and deposits them in the Bhagirathi and the rivers themselves. This silting is causing great inconvenience for the Kolkata Port and often result flooding in the years of heavy rain. The distributaries of the Padma River like Bhairab, Jalangi, Mathabhanga River and their tributaries enters West Bengal and joins the Bhagirathi on its left bank. The Bhairab and the Jalangi meet and their joined waters known as Jalangi falls into Bhagirathi. The Mathabhanga divides into branches namely; Churni and Ichhamati, while the Churni meets the Bhagirathi while the other flows southwards and joins the Kalindi. The Sunderbans region is covered by numerous estuaries and streams, mainly distributaries of main rivers. The rivers are interconnected and are fed by tidal waters. The major rivers of the area are Hoogly, Matla, Gosaba, Saptamukhi, Haribhanga, Piyali, Thakuran/ Jamira, Raimangal, Kalindi and Ichhamati. The Teesta flows cutting deep gorges from north to south in the mountainous Darjeeling district, it enters the plains at Sevoke and flows in a mighty stream on straight line towards the south east until it pours its waters into the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh. Torsa, Jaldhaka, Kaljani, Raidak, Sankosh and Mahananda rivers are in the northern hilly region which rise in the Himalayas and flow in a southerly direction through the districts of Darjeeling, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and North and South Dinajpur and enters Bangladesh. As most of the rivers are snow fed, so most of the rivers are perennial in nature and often floods during the rainy season. The entire region is made up of sand, gravel and pebbles laid down by these rivers. The Mahananda rises from the Dow Hills forest, near the town of Darjeeling and are fed by similar small rivers like, Mahananda, Balason, and Machi and runs in a zig-zag way through the district of Malda and joins the Padma in Bangladesh. In the central region, the main river is the Mahananda. The Tangon and Punarbhabha, and Atrai arises in the plains, while the former two joins together and flows into Mahanadi, Atrai flows into the Padma. Wetlands The Sundarbans delta is the largest mangrove forest in the world. It lies at the mouth of the Ganges and is spread across areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. The Bangladeshi and Indian portions of the jungle are listed in the UNESCO world heritage list separately as the Sundarbans and Sundarbans National Park respectively, though they are parts of the same forest. The Sundarbans are intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna. The most famous among these is the Bengal tiger, but numerous species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes also inhabit it. It is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. Climate Average Annual Rainfall in West Bengal Many areas remain flooded during the heavy rains brought by monsoon West Bengal's climate varies from tropical savannah in the southern portions to humid subtropical in the north. The main seasons are summer, rainy season, a short autumn, and winter. While the summer in the delta region is noted for excessive humidity, the western highlands experience a dry summer like northern India, with the highest day temperature ranging from to . At nights, a cool southerly breeze carries moisture from the Bay of Bengal. In early summer brief squalls and thunderstorms known as \\"kal-baisakhi\\" often arrive from the north or northwest. Monsoons bring rain to the whole state from June to September. West Bengal receives the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Ocean monsoon that moves in a northwest direction. Winter (December‚ÄìJanuary) is mild over the plains with average minimum temperatures of . A cold and dry northern wind blows in the winter, substantially lowering the humidity level. However, the Darjeeling Himalayan Hill region experiences a harsh winter, with occasional snowfall at places. Natural resources Map showing areas where various minerals are found in West Bengal West Bengal stands third in the country in terms of mineral production. The state contributes about one-fifth to the total production of minerals in the country. Coal constitutes 99% of the minerals extracted in West Bengal; fireclay, china clay, limestone, copper, iron, wolfram, manganese and dolomite are mined in small quantities. There are good possibilities of obtaining mineral oil and natural gas in the areas near the Bay of Bengal, in Purba Medinipur, Sundarbans, South 24 Parganas and North Bengal plains. Research is ongoing in various places to locate natural gas. West Bengal is the third largest state for coal production, accounting for about half of India's total. Coal is extracted from about 228 mines in the Raniganj and Asansol region of Bardhaman district. High grade bituminous coal is mined at Raniganj, Dishergarh, Santaldih, Kulti, Barakar, Ghushik, Kajora. Coalfields stretch over an area of about . The coalfields of Raniganj support the Asansol-Durgapur industrial belt by providing fuel to the industries as well as generation of thermal power. Lignite mined in Darjeeling is used to make briquettes. Coal deposits are also found along the Ajoy river in Birbhum district. West Bengal ranks next to Bihar and Madhya Pradesh in production of fireclay. Most of this mineral is extracted in the Raniganj region along with a small quantity also extracted from Birbhum and Purulia. China clay used in the pottery, paper, textile, rubber and paint industries is unearthed at Mohammad Bazar in Birbhum and Mejia in Bankura. The rest of the production comes from Purulia, Bardhaman, Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri. In 1993‚Äì94 1.24 lakh metric tons of fireclay were produced in West Bengal. Limestone which is used in cement industry is mined in Bankura, Purulia, Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri. There are copper mines in Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. Small quantities of low quality iron-ore are mined in Bardhaman, Purulia, Birbhum and Darjeeling. There is manganese in the Jhargram region of Paschim Medinipur, Purulia and Bardhaman. Wolfram is mined at Jhilimili in Bankura. The state's production of dolomite comes from the Dooars region of Jalpaiguri. 38.5 thousand tonnes of dolomite were raised in 1993‚Äì94.

In 2001 he was nominated as the president of the district unit and continued to hold that post until he was nominated as the party's candidate for the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency in 2004. He defeated his opponent, the Indian National Congress candidate, and became a Member of the 14th Lok Sabha. He was then re-elected to Lok Sabha from Belagavi in 2009, 2014, and 2019. He held the distinction of never having lost an election. In May 2019, Angadi became Minister of State for Railways and served in that position until his death in September 2020. As a minister, he approved the Suburban Commuter Rail project in Bangalore. He also signed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Bangalore International Airport for the building of a railway station near the airport that would provide connectivity to the center of the city. The station was to be built by BIAL and handed over to the Indian Railways for operations and maintenance. Some of the other projects advanced by Angadi as the Minister of State for Railways included the country's first private and the longest 'roll-on, roll-off' freight service for goods trucks along the 682 kilometer route between Bangalore and Solapur. As the Minister of State for Railways, he also introduced the direct recruitment examination to the railways in 2019, with over 4.7 million candidates appearing in the examination that was conducted in 15 languages. In 2019, he had also signed a MoU with the Confederation of Indian Industry to drive energy efficiency and pilot projects aimed at setting up net-zero buildings and mechanisms for sharing of energy management practices between the industry association and the Indian Railways. He had announced a call for 150 railway stations across the country to be green certified by 2020. In his 16-month tenure as the Minister of State for Railways he was credited for introducing over 50 train services just in the South Western division alone. At the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown in India, he introduced special trains across states in India, including 31 pairs of special Rajdhani express trains and 254 pairs of special mail and express trains, aimed at enabling travel of migrant labour. He also headed the Suresh Angadi Education Foundation, which runs educational institutions across Karnataka. Death Angadi tested positive for COVID-19 on 11 September 2020 and was initially asymptomatic. He was later hospitalized at AIIMS hospital in New Delhi and died on 23 September 2020 at the age of 65, making him the first Indian Union minister to die of COVID-19. Given the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions his body was not allowed to be transported to Belagavi and Angadi was buried as per the COVID-19 protocol in the Lingayat-Veerashaiva burial ground at Sector 24, Dwarka in Delhi.

The Far West Village extends from the Hudson River to Hudson Street, between Gansevoort Street and Leroy Street.COMMUNITY BOARD 2 MANHATTAN: STATEMENT OF NEEDS, Fiscal Year 2009 Neighboring communities include Chelsea to the north, the South Village and Hudson Square to the south, and the Washington Square neighborhood of Greenwich Village to the east.Community Board No. 2 (map), accessed July 29, 2018 The West Village is part of Manhattan Community District 2, and is patrolled by the 6th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Residential property sale prices in West Village are among the most expensive in the United States, typically exceeding US in 2017. History The Stonewall Inn at 53 Christopher Street, a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark and National Monument, as the site of the 1969 Stonewall Riots. Beginning in the early 1980s, residential development spread in the Far West Village between West Street and Hudson Street, from West 14th Street to West Houston Street, resulting in the area being given its own name. =Preservation= Historically, local residents and preservation groups have been concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve the architectural and historic integrity of the neighborhood. More than 50 blocks, bordering 14th Street to the north, comprise a historic district established by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The district's convoluted borders run no farther south than 4th Street or St. Luke's Place, and no farther east than Washington Square East or University Place. Redevelopment in this area is severely restricted, and developers must preserve the main facade and aesthetics of the buildings, even during renovation. This district‚Äîwhich was for four decades the city's largest‚Äîwas created in 1969 by the then-four-year-old New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. However, preservationists advocated for the entire neighborhood to be designated a historic district; although it covers most of the West Village, the blocks closest to the Hudson River are excluded. Advocates continued to pursue their goal of additional designation, spurred in particular by the increased pace of development in the 1990s. The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to the architectural and cultural character and heritage of the neighborhood, successfully proposed new districts and individual landmarks to the LPC. Those include: 396-397 West Street at West 10th Street is a former hotel which dates from 1904, and is part of the Weehawken Street Historic District * Gansevoort Market Historic District was the first new historic district in Greenwich Village in 34 years. The 112 buildings on 11 blocks protect the city's distinctive Meatpacking District with its cobblestone streets, warehouses and rowhouses. About 70 percent of the area proposed by GVSHP in 2000 was designated a historic district by the LPC in 2003, while the entire area was listed on the State and National Registers of Historic Places in 2007. * Weehawken Street Historic District, designated in 2006, is a 14-building, three-block district near the Hudson River centering on tiny Weehawken Street and containing an array of architecture including a sailor's hotel, former stables, and a wooden house. * Greenwich Village Historic District Extension I, designated in 2006, brought 46 more buildings on three blocks into the district, thus protecting warehouses, a former public school and police station, and early 19th-century rowhouses. Both the Weehawken Street Historic District and the Greenwich Village Historic District Extension I were designated by the LPC in response to the larger proposal for a Far West Village Historic District submitted by GVSHP in 2004. The Landmarks Preservation Commission also designated as landmarks several individual sites proposed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, including the former Bell Telephone Labs Complex (1861‚Äì1963), now Westbeth Artists Community, designated in 2011; and houses at 159 Charles Street and 354 W. 11th Street, as well as the Keller Hotel, all in 2007. 173 and 176 Perry Street, rare examples of modern architecture in the Far West Village. In addition, several contextual rezonings were enacted in Greenwich Village in recent years to limit the size and height of allowable new development in the neighborhood, and to encourage the preservation of existing buildings. The following were proposed by the GVSHP and passed by the City Planning Commission: * Far West Village Rezoning, approved in 2005, was the first downzoning in Manhattan in many years, putting in place new height caps, thus ending construction of high-rise waterfront towers in much of the Village and encouraging the reuse of existing buildings. * Washington and Greenwich Street Rezoning, approved in 2010, was passed in near-record time to protect six blocks from out-of-scale hotel development and maintain the low-rise character. =Reputation as urban bohemia= Gay Street at the corner of Waverly Place The West Village historically was known as an important landmark on the map of American bohemian culture in the early and mid- twentieth century. The neighborhood was known for its colorful, artistic residents and the alternative culture they propagated. Due in part to the progressive attitudes of many of its residents, the Village was a focal point of new movements and ideas, whether political, artistic, or cultural. This tradition as an enclave of avant-garde and alternative culture was established during the 19th century and into the 20th century, when small presses, art galleries, and experimental theater thrived. Known as \\"Little Bohemia\\" starting in 1916,(nd) Greenwich Village East and West - History and Legacies . Arts and Music Pennsylvania. Retrieved June 17, 2007. West Village is in some ways the center of the bohemian lifestyle on the West Side, with classic artists' lofts in the form of the Westbeth Artists Community and Julian Schnabel's Palazzo Chupi. It is also the site of sleek new residential towers designed by American architect Richard Meier facing the Hudson River at 173/176 Perry Street. The Cherry Lane Theatre is located in the West Village. The annual Greenwich Village Halloween Parade is the world's largest Halloween parade and takes place in the West Village. In 1924, the Cherry Lane Theatre was established at 38 Commerce Street. It is New York City's oldest continuously running Off-Broadway theater. A landmark in Greenwich Village's cultural landscape, it was built as a farm silo in 1817, and also served as a tobacco warehouse and box factory before Edna St. Vincent Millay and other members of the Provincetown Players converted the structure into a theatre they christened the Cherry Lane Playhouse, which opened on March 24, 1924, with the play The Man Who Ate the Popomack. During the 1940s The Living Theatre, Theatre of the Absurd, and the Downtown Theater movement all took root there, and it developed a reputation as a place where aspiring playwrights and emerging voices could showcase their work. On January 8, 1947, stevedore Andy Hintz was fatally shot by hitmen John M. Dunn, Andrew Sheridan and Danny Gentile in front of his apartment on Grove Street. Before he died on January 29, he told his wife that \\"Johnny Dunn shot me.\\" The three gunmen were immediately arrested. Sheridan and Dunn were executed.

The annual Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, initiated in 1974 by Greenwich Village puppeteer and mask maker Ralph Lee, is the world's largest Halloween parade and America's only major nighttime parade, attracting more than 60,000 costumed participants, 2 million in-person spectators, and a worldwide television audience of over 100 million. Street grid Some 18th-century streets, such as Bedford Street (pictured), are narrow. The neighborhood is distinguished by streets that are \\"off the grid\\", being set at an angle to the other streets in Manhattan. These roads were laid out in an 18th-century grid plan, approximately parallel or perpendicular to the Hudson, long before the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 which created the main street grid plan for later parts of the city. Even streets that were given numbers in the 19th century to make them nominally part of the grid can be idiosyncratic, at best. West 4th Street, formerly Asylum Street, crosses West 10th, 11th and 12th Streets, ending at an intersection with West 13th Street. Heading north on Greenwich Street, West 12th Street is separated by three blocks from Little West 12th Street, which in turn is one block south of West 13th Street. Further, some of the smaller east-west residential streets are paved with setts (often confused with cobblestones), particularly in Far West Village and the Meatpacking District. This grid is prevalent through the rest of Greenwich Village as well. Demographics 66 Perry Street was featured in Sex and the City as Carrie Bradshaw's house.

Police and crime NYPD 6th Precinct The West Village is patrolled by the 6th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 233 West 10th Street. The 6th Precinct ranked 68th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. This is due to a high incidence of property crime. The 6th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 80.6% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 1 murder, 20 rapes, 153 robberies, 121 felony assaults, 163 burglaries, 1,031 grand larcenies, and 28 grand larcenies auto in 2018. The Meatpacking District at the north end of this neighborhood, also known as the \\"Gansevoort Historic District\\", is filled with trendy boutiques and nightclubs. It is also the area's most concentrated site of grand larceny. (Grand larceny in New York is legally defined as stealing property worth $1,000 or more or property taken from the person of another without the threat of force.) In February 2013 the NYPD passed out 3,500 fliers to bars and clubs in the Sixth Precinct warning people to guard their valuables, especially at district's clubs, due to the rise in grand larceny rates.

In the late 70's it was one of the biggest Greek companies, operating three factories (in Athens, where its headquarters were located, Thessaloniki and Larissa) and several other auxiliary facilities throughout the country. In addition, BIAMAX became a leading industry in Greece, in areas including Quality Assurance, technical training, process documentation and Research & Development. Although its main activity was vehicle manufacture (in the late 1970s its industrial sector employed more than 2,000), some of its subsidiaries were also involved in areas like tourist services, exports of farm products and shipping.  Early activities  Its origins date back to the 1930s when the Fostiropoulos family became importers of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The company with that name was founded in 1956, the name reflecting its original activity, as it started with production of bus bodies on Mercedes-Benz chassis (BIAMAX, stands for \\"Biomihania Amaxomaton\\", or \\"Vehicle Body Building Industry\\"; the name was retained although the company soon became a complete vehicle producer).  Original developments  The first chassis developed by BIAMAX was introduced in January, 1960. In the same year the famous R series of coaches and inter-city buses was introduced. One of the earliest chassiless bus designs in the world, it was an engineering achievement involving novel approaches in suspension and structure, developed by the engineers Antonios Rizos (who lent his name initial to the series) and Ioannis Dracoulis (who was responsible for its extremely elegant, streamlined design). Models R495 (inter-city bus) and R514 (coach) became common sights in the country, establishing the BIAMAX brand. In 1962 a trolleybus type (also chassiless) was designed and built, with Lancia axles and transmission and CGE electricals; as an imported type was ordered for Athens, only one trolleybus was produced but it nonetheless entered service remaining in operation for more than 15 years.  1960s and 1970s: The \\"Golden Age\\"  The very successful F series of city and inter-city buses (named after Fostiropoulos initial, a designation used earlier as well) was introduced in 1965 employing a ladder-type chassis developed by BIAMAX, and, as most of its products, Mercedes-Benz engines. The most common types produced were the F530 and F580, with several body variations for a variety of end uses. At the same time BIAMAX introduced railway wagons, and kept producing an extended range of bus and truck bodies, assembling 4x4's and tractors etc., with thousands of vehicles coming out of its factories, many of which were exported to a large number of countries, mainly in Europe, Asia and Africa; at times the company exported as much as 50% of its production. One of the most notable models specifically developed for Africa and the Middle East was the \\"Desert Bus\\", an extremely rugged construction whose production started in 1963, for long distance travel with cross-country and extra load capabilities (including the capability to carry tons of load on its roof), optionally with A/C, beds, toilets etc. F580 types can be seen to this date working hard in the Middle East. Indeed, the legendary reliability of BIAMAX buses can be testified by the large number of surviving examples, most of them in excellent working condition. One of the most successful ventures of Biamax was the production of Mercedes-Benz O302 and O303 coaches, including variants like the O302S2 type, which essentially was a \\"blend\\" of both models.  Evolutions after 1980  The company faced difficulties in the early 1980s when some Middle Eastern markets were lost but, mostly, due to the new laws allowing import of used buses in Greece. The entry of Greece to the European Communities canceled the Greek \\"protectionist\\" laws for the local automobile industry and the duties for importing foreign vehicles. In 1986 it ceased production, focusing on vehicle import and distribution. Since 1999, after an attempt by Sfakianakis S.A. to acquire the company was not completed (Sfakianakis acquired only the truck and tractor importing division), all trading activity ceased as well; former parts of the company have focused on shipping and other activities and what is left of BIAMAX operates to date as a real estate management firm. The old industry facilities on Athinon Avenue remain abandoned.  External links  * Greek bus builders in Bus-planet.com  References  *L.S. Skartsis and G.A.

The college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The college's offerings include university transfer, early college, professional certification, workforce development, continuing education and enrichment. Through its nationally acclaimed University Center, which opened in 1991, it offers bachelor's degree completion and graduate level programs. Growing steadily from the first 84 students that showed up for class on September 16, 1954 at Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan, Macomb now serves approximately 59,000 annually. Because of its location in Macomb County, often cited as a political bellwether, and its reputation for workforce training and retraining, Macomb has been a popular stop for presidents launching new educational initiatives and presidential candidates on the campaign trail. It has hosted every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan at least once, including President Donald Trump twice in 2016.  History  South Macomb Community College, as it was first called, was founded by educators from the Van Dyke School District who believed the lack of access to higher education was greatly impeding the success of the county and its residents. The first classes were held after hours in the district's Lincoln High School, with a transfer curriculum developed in collaboration with educators from the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University. Enrollment at Macomb reached 3,000 by 1962. With the college rapidly outgrowing the space allotted to it by the school district, its founders developed a plan to expand its size and scope. The go-ahead was given in 1962 when Macomb County voters approved an operating millage to support the Community College District of Macomb, autonomous of the Van Dyke School District. The 20-year operating millage has been reauthorized twice by voters. After passage of the first millage, an ambitious construction program ensued for the newly named Macomb County Community College. South Campus in Warren opened in 1965, and Center Campus in Clinton Township opened in 1968. East Campus, which houses a training center for police, fire and emergency services personnel, opened in 1996, and M-TEC, dedicated to workforce development, opened in 2002. The college purchased (and later sold) property in Ray Township for a North Campus that never materialized and previously operated a campus and a satellite in Fraser and Washington Township, respectively. The school shortened its name to Macomb Community College in 1981.  Funding  The college offers nearly 200 degree and certificate programs, including those in high-tech and high-demand fields. Because of the generosity of donors to the Macomb Community College Foundation, there are more than 100 private scholarships for Macomb students. In 2009, Macomb became one of the first community colleges to join Achieving the Dream, a national initiative aimed at helping community college students succeed. The Dreamkeepers Emergency Assistance Fund and the Mall at Partridge Creek Student Assistance Fund, coordinated by the College's Student Options for Success office, provide financial assistance to eligible students in the event of a one-time financial emergency that hinders their ability to continue college.

Originally, it operated using steam, and was later converted to use electricity. It was used to power machinery, including lifts, across London. The Tower Subway was used to transfer the power, and steam, to districts south of the river. The surviving complex consists of the engine house, boiler house, water tanks, accumulator tower, reservoir, boiler master's house, seven 1950s throw ram pumps, a 1950s pilot accumulator, a gantry crane, two transformers and switchgear. It is located at Wapping Wall. The building was designated a grade II* listed building in December 1977. After its closure as a pumping station on 30 June 1977, the building was converted by architectural practice Shed 54 and reopened by Jules Wright, as an arts centre (The Wapping Project) and restaurant (Wapping Food). It held its first exhibition in 1993, and opened in a new form in 2000. Exhibitions were mounted across the building including the Boiler House and the Engine House, with most of the original equipment still in place. The Wapping Project sold the building in 2013 to focus on its core mission of commissioning new art. In 2013, the freehold of the building was sold to developers UK Real Estate Ltd.

Allegories Based on what is known of the sources of the Africa map, Hase primary contribution to the maps were adding a cultural explanation in the form of Allegorical cartoons on the map itself, though he may have had a greater role in other maps. On the map of Africa, for example, he added in the lower corner of the map a large allegorical scene showing a finely dressed woman in clothes that are similar to modern-day clothing. The men are either dressed with single piece servants clothes, or an African rulers garbs, or fully dressed European traders. Notably, the indigenous African ruler is sitting on the back of a crouching human prostrating as a stool. Also shown in the allegory are lions and other animals and some semblance of life on the continent. The Asia map also has such allegorical scene.

The Nautilina are derived from the Syringonautilidae, a family in the Centroceratina (Trigonocerataceae), in the Late Triassic and consists of four families, the Nautilidae, Cymatoceratidae, Herocoglossidae, and Aturiidae. The Nautilidae which is the root stock of the suborder includes the living Nautilus The Nautilidae are involute or slightly evolute and generally smooth with straight to sinuous sutures. The Cymatoceratidae which are the most common of the Cretaceous nautiloids are strongly ribbed. The Hercoglossidae are smooth but with differentiated sutures, in some with deep lateral lobes and well- developed saddles. The Aturiidae (Aturia) is similar to the Hercoglossidae except for being more discoidal and having a more complex suture and subdorsal siphuncle. The Nautilidae gave rise to the Cymatoceratidae and Hercoglossidae during the Jurassic while the Herocoglossidae became ancestral to the Aturiidae near the beginning of the Cenozoic. The Cymatoceratidae and Hercoglossidae became extinct near the end of the Paleogene while the Aturiidae reached into the Neogene. Only the Nautilidae remain.
