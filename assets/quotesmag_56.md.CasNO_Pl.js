Founded on April 6, 1866 in Decatur, Illinois on the principles of \\"Fraternity, Charity and Loyalty\\" by Benjamin F. Stephenson, it was dissolved in 1956 when its last member died. Linking men through their experience of the war, the GAR became among the first organized advocacy group in American politics, supporting voting rights for black veterans, lobbying the US Congress to establish veterans' pensions, and supporting Republican political candidates. Its peak membership, at more than 400,000, was in 1890. It was succeeded by the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW), composed of male descendants of Union veterans. The GAR initially grew and prospered as a de facto political arm of the Republican Party during the heated political contests of the Reconstruction era. The commemoration of Union veterans, black and white, immediately became entwined with partisan politics. When the Republican Party's commitment to reform in the South gradually decreased, the GAR's mission became ill-defined and the organization floundered. The GAR almost disappeared in the early 1870s, and many divisions ceased to exist. In the 1880s, the organization revived under new leadership that provided a platform for renewed growth, by advocating federal pensions for veterans. As the organization revived, black veterans joined in significant numbers and organized local posts. The national organization, however, failed to press the case for pensions for black soldiers. Most black troops never received any pension or remuneration for wounds incurred during their service. The GAR was organized into \\"Departments\\" at the state level and \\"Posts\\" at the community level, and military-style uniforms were worn by its members. There were posts in every state in the U.S., and several posts overseas. Commanders-in-Chief were elected by the membership at the National Encampments for one year terms. Several Commanders- in-Chief were re-elected for additional terms.

Li Chen started his career accepting projects from Buddhist shrines to produce traditional Buddha statues. He studied the Buddhist and Taoist classics. In the 1990s he began to focus on a career in art. Li's works are infused with personal sentiment. Early life and career = Youth = When he attended National Dajia Industrial Senior High School, Li studied arts and crafts and during his six years at junior and senior-high school was influenced by such contemporary Taiwanese artists as Chen Hsin-wan, Cheng Chiung-ming, Lee Chin- hsiu and Huang Pu-ching. Before joining Taiwan's mandatory military service, Li Chen took up a position in the workshop of renowned local sculptor Hsieh Tung-liang where he studied body sculpture. = Art career = In 1987, a lay Buddhist bumped into Li Chen working in his studio and said to him: ‚ÄúYoung man I used to paint a little myself, your realist work is really quite good, would you like to try and make a Buddha statue? I have a small Buddhist alter why not try your hand?‚Äù Li agreed right away. It was not until later that he discovered sculpting Buddha was much harder than sculpting a person. His response was to throw himself heart and soul into the study of religious art and the Buddhist classics. In between the different projects he accepted, Li Chen spent as much time as he could pursuing his own creative interests, but soon came to find sculpting Buddha statues too limiting. Li had always sought to express the creative desire that resides in the hearts of all true artists, but there was no place for such subjective thinking in his chosen profession, which is why he does not consider the pieces produced in this period to be his own creations. As a result, Li decided to focus on research. Only then was he finally able to devote his full attention to creating art, making his artistic debut in 1999.  Creative work  = Art Series = Li Chen seeks to convey the spirit and meaning of Eastern culture through sculpture. However, because expressive methods contain ideas novel to a specific time, the forms used by Buddhist sculpture for a Millennia presented a uniquely difficult obstacle, one that Li has been able to identify and overcome. Two of Li Chen‚Äôs early art series The Beauty of Emptiness and Energy of Emptiness were filled with simple minimalist lines that created an aesthetic of emptiness and reinterpreted the semiotic image of Buddha statues. At the same time, the roundness and fullness of the statues combined the Chinese philosophy of the Tao, \\"Qi\\" and energy, creating a visual tension that is both heavy and light.Wang Chiachi. \\"Like a Child.\\" Li Chen 1992‚Äì2002 Sculpture. Taipei: Asia Art Center, 2004: 27. In the Spiritual Journey Through the Great Ether series Li Chen is already far less limited by tradition, inventing an innovative technique that incorporated gold and silver leaf on the exterior of his bronze sculptures. In contrast, Soul Guardians was inspired by the artist's reflections on the occurrence of natural disasters over almost a decade and based on a \\"spiritual and philosophical interpretations of these catastrophes.\\" In this way, Li took the main character of a myth as his creative focus as he discussed the significance of \\"God\\" for humanity. This series conveys Li Chen's genuine concern about the nature of society, culture and humanity, and as a result the pieces are infused with a transcendent quality.Soul Guardians. Taipei: Asia Art Center, 2009. This was followed by The Beacon: When Night Light Glimmers series, which took a ‚Äúspecial light‚Äù as its creative core. From the use of materials to the philosophy behind the work, the idea of a ‚Äúcreative spark‚Äù explains Li Chen‚Äôs fascination with spiritual light and energy, and the way in which after observing culture, life and the world, he found it easier to portray Eastern humanism.Thomas Lee. ‚ÄùOf Spiritual Light and Aesthetic Delight.‚Äù The Beacon Series: When Night Light Glimmers. Taipei: Asia Art Center, 2009: 16‚Äì18. In the near decades, Li Chen has spent most of the time carrying out his reflections on human nature in his creative works, thus started the Ordinary People series in 2010 that further reflected the artist's extensive spiritual contemplation. Once viewers are familiar with the ink black surface and the creative idea of lightness and weight in his works, viewing his sculptures while pursuing spiritual pleasure will become a kind of habitual response. In Ordinary People series exhibited this time, Li turned to characterize all walks of life, which sought to face the weight of reality. While Li takes pleasure in Spiritual Journey Through the Great Ether, he still returned to the most primitive mode of exploring the foundation of human nature, experiencing the virtual and inspecting the real at the same time. The 2011 series Immortality of Fate, which is one of the Li's \\"virtual\\" series, utilized wood, rope and ceramic clay to convey the artist's awareness of the changeability of cause and effect in life. Regardless of whether these bodies are \\"alive\\" or \\"dead,\\" they record the process of corruption and decay. Facing the endless flow of history, viewers feel first hand the rise and fall of powers, cycles and perpetual change. In the same year, Li Chen also produced the Ethereal Cloud series, the first time he showed cast stainless steel pieces, which ingeniously imitated clouds and smoke. For Li, these cyclical phenomena are imbued with their own soul. = Exhibitions and honors = Li Chen has held a number of solo exhibitions; Openasia 2004, 7th International Exhibition of Sculptures and Installations in Venice, Italy; 2007 Venice Biennale; 2008 National Art Museum of China, Beijing; 2009 Singapore Art Museum; 2011 Art Stage Singapore and Greatness of Spirit: Li Chen Premiere Sculpture Exhibition in Taiwan, Taipei; 2012 Frye Art Museum in Seattle; Li Chen 2013 Place Vend√¥me Premiere Sculpture Exhibition in Paris.

The audience had been familiar with the ink black surface and the creative idea of lightness and weight in Li Chen's works were touched by the portrait of human nature with great clarity in this exhibition though. A report in the January 2012 edition of \\"Art.Investment\\" magazine detailed references to Li Chen in an annual report on the international contemporary art market for 2009‚Äì2010 that appeared on \\"ArtPrice,\\" a world leader in art market information.http://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/fiac10en.pdf This provided a detailed analysis and introduction: Based on total global auction house sales figures Li Chen is the sixth best selling artist in the world. In the broader rankings of contemporary artists he ranked 53rd and in the sculpture section for 2009‚Äì2010, Li was one of just two Chinese artists listed in the top 15 world sculptors along with Anish Kapoor, Jeff Koons, Subodh Gupta, Antony Gormley and Matthew Day Jackson.Art Investment.

Taipei: Art Touch. = Discovery Channel's \\"Chineseness\\" = Discovery Channel witnesses the rise of Chinese in the 21st century in terms of economy, culture or even politics. Along with the rise, contemporary Chinese artists have also begun setting trends and become a new force. Discovery Channel gathers some of the most internationally recognized Chinese artists to produce Chineseness, a four-part documentary series. Each one-hour episode in Chineseness is dedicated to a different Chinese artist, who include Yang Chihung (also known as Chihung Yang) and Li Chen from Taiwan and Zhang Huan and Xu Bing from China. In the \\"Li Chen\\" episode, the dialogue between the artist and the hostess Dr. Agnes Hsu reveals Li Chen's life experiences and how it affects his social observation and creative thinking. During the one-year shooting and production the Discovery Channel's team traveled in both Asia and Europe, and the trip to Paris allowed them to document the exhibition at Place Vend√¥me, which is considered a milestone in the East-West cultural exchange. The series started to air from December 2013 in 28 countries or regions, including Taiwan (premiere), China, Hong Kong, Macau, Mongolia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Brunei, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Guam, Fiji. =Solo exhibitions= *2018 Through the Ages - Li Chen Solo Exhibition, Aurora Museum, Shanghai, China *2017 Being: In/Voluntary Drift - Li Chen Solo Exhibition, Museum of Contemporary Art, Taipei, Taiwan *2014-15 Journey of Solitary Existence: Li Chen's ‚ÄúOrdinary People‚Äù Series Debut Exhibition, Asia Art Center, Beijing, China *2013‚Äì14 Discovery Channel's documentary \\"Chineseness\\", Taipei, Taiwan *2013 Li Chen 2013 Place Vend√¥me Premiere Sculpture Exhibition in ParisLi Chen official website: lichensculpture.gaa-software.com *2012 Li Chen: Eternity and Commoner, Frye Art Museum, Seattle *2011 Greatness of Spirit: Li Chen Premiere Sculpture Exhibition in Taiwan, Taipei *2010 The Beacon‚Äì When Night Light Glimmers, ShContemporary 10, Shanghai *2009 Li Chen: Mind‚ÄßBody‚ÄßSpirit, Singapore Art Museum, Singapore *2008 Soul Guardians- Li Chen Solo Show, Asia Art Center, Beijing ::In Search of Spiritual Space, National Museum of China, Beijing *2007 Energy of Emptiness, 52nd International Art Exhibition ‚Äì La Biennale di Venezia, Venice *2005 Li Chen Sculpture, Art Taipei 2005, Taipei *2003 Spiritual Journey Through the Great Ether, Michael Goedhuis Gallery, New York *2001 Delights of Ordinary People, River Art Gallery, Taichung *2000 The Transformation of Emptiness ‚Äì Boundary within Boundary, Art Taipei 2000, Taipei *1999 Energy of Emptiness, Art Taipei, Taipei Selected International Group Exhibitions *2019 BuddhaÔºéChina-Buddhist Objects in the Early Stage from the Gansu Provincial Museum, Suzhou, China *2015 Rest on Water and Gargle with Stone: Chinese Contemporary Literati Art, Beijing, China *2013 Culture.

In this way, they examine and reflect critically on the loss of the soul and morality in the current of material desires in contemporary society.\\"Yin Shuangxi. Li Chen \\"Ordinary People\\" Solo Exhibition Information. 2014. Huang Haiming, Director of Taipei Fine Arts Museum and invited scholar for Li Chen's \\"Ordinary People\\" exhibition once said to the artist: ‚ÄúIt seems that the realities of your living environment and cultural background provided you with exactly the right conditions needed to develop a deep understanding of social truth, power structures and the hardships of life. This allows you to observe, grasp and reflect the distorted nature of contemporary society through art. Huang also compared Li‚Äôs intent to that of realist literary giant Honor√© de Balzac: ‚ÄúClearly your concerns go beyond Taiwan as you have shown an interest in trends in China, including the dramatic contrast in values since the country opened to the outside world, the different conditions in which children are brought up under the one child policy and the strange character distortions to which these have given rise. This can be seen in Li Chen‚Äôs focus on society and the crafting of his major projects around the collective character of ordinary people. In many ways, this is an approach that brings to mind Balzac‚Äôs attempts to depict the diversity of society.‚Äù Jo-Anne Birnie Danzker, Director of the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, United States, once remarked, \\"It has been above all the fascinating and complex cultural and sociopolitical conditions of Li Chen's birthplace, Taiwan, that have enriched his work and imbued it with specific aesthetic characteristics, especially the presence of elements of folk culture and local religion in his work, the easy co-existence of the fine arts and craft.\\"Jo-Anne Birnie Danzker.

Kwok Kian Chow, Director of the Singapore Art Museum stated, \\"Seeing these tensions in the Zen philosophy context, they are about the void that is not the vacuity, and the right balance of what is intrinsic and what is transcendental, which must come into a synthesis in the viewer's mind. \\"Tension\\" is not quite the right description of the kind of push-and-pull tussles in Li Chen sculptures, as they look completely serene and resolved, only because they stimulate the mental processes in the viewer of an animated mass between mass and void.\\"Kwok Kian Chow.

Foster and written by Lewis R. Foster and Daniel Mainwaring. The film stars John Payne, Rhonda Fleming, Dennis O'Keefe, Thomas Gomez, Fred Clark and Frank Faylen. The film was released on May 30, 1950, by Paramount Pictures. Plot In 1863, Governor Lubbock (Grandon Rhodes) of Texas has asked Todd Croyden (John Payne) of the Texas Rangers to spring a Union Army spy from a Confederate camp and bring him back. France is trying to seize Mexico and the governor is aiding the latter's defense effort. Guns and ammo are being stolen in Corales, so the governor wants the Ranger and the spy, Whitney Randolph (Dennis O'Keefe), to investigate. Croyden doesn't much care for Randolph, who wins his horse and harmonica gambling on the trail. While crossing the Rio Grande, they end up held at gunpoint by a woman, Madeline Danzeeger (Rhonda Fleming), whose wagon is stuck. After helping her, they learn that a former German army officer also named Danzeeger, likely her father, is working with a Mexican general, Liguras (Thomas Gomez), for big money. Croyden locates the missing munitions at Basil Danzeeger's (Fred Clark) ranch, but foreman Red Hyatt (Frank Faylen) is suspicious of him. A fire set by Croyden and Randolph destroys the gunpowder, but Madeline turns out to be Basil's wife and takes them prisoner. Red Hyatt tries to kill Croyden by tying him to two wild horses. Randolph dies while saving him. Madeline has a change of heart, having fallen in love with Croyden, and is shot by her husband. Basil and Liguras end up in a fight to the death fatal to both, and, luckily, it appears Madeline will recover. Cast * John Payne as Capt.

It has a height of feet and is over long at its crest, impounding the Lake Fork of the Arkansas River near its headwaters. The earthen dam was one of five reservoir dams completed from 1965 to 1968 by the United States Bureau of Reclamation as part of the larger water diversion project named the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project. The project was authorized in 1962 by President Kennedy and was completed in 1981. The Fry-Ark diverts water across the continental divide from the Colorado River basin. This water is delivered to the more arid plains east of the Rocky Mountains. Although the predominant use is agricultural, some water is available to several cities east of the continental divide, including: Colorado Springs, Pueblo, La Junta, Lamar. Water is diverted from the West Slope's Fryingpan River basin through a series of interconnected tunnels and small diversion dams into the Charles H. Boustead Tunnel. The Boustead runs water underneath the Continental Divide before discharging it into Turquoise Lake. Water then leaves Turquoise Lake via the Mt. Elbert Conduit, which runs nearly to the Mt. Elbert Forebay, then dropped down over in elevation to the hydro-electric Mt. Elbert Power Plant.

Due to civil war that saw South Sudan split from Sudan, he has refused to compete under the flag of the latter, stating that, \\"It would be betraying my people\\". He was one of four athletes competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics under the Olympic flag rather than that of an individual country. A film has been made of his life called ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù. Early life Maker left home at the age of seven to live with his uncle in northern Sudan. In 1994, at the age of nine, he fled from a refugee camp during the Sudanese Civil War. While 28 members of his family were killed during the conflict, he was able to escape to Egypt, and then permanently to the United States. He was granted refugee status by the United States when he was 16, and now lives and trains in Flagstaff, Arizona. Though his parents survived the civil war, at the time of the 2012 Olympics he had not seen them in 20 years. However he returned to South Sudan in 2013 and was reunited with his parents. Eight of his brothers and sisters were killed in the war. He began participating in track and field while attending high school in Concord, New Hampshire,http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/346760/going-the-distance after being encouraged by his gym teacher and also competed in college at Iowa State, where he was an All-American athlete. 2012 Summer Olympics Marial fulfilled the A-qualification standard for the marathon in October 2011, allowing him to participate in the Olympic marathon event at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

He holds permanent resident status in the United States, but not citizenship. According to his interview in Runner's World, He applied for naturalization to become a U.S. citizen in 2011 and had his naturalization interview, but his application remains pending: \\"Technically, I was supposed to be a citizen last June, because I did everything, I did my citizen test, I did my interview, I did my fingerprint, and everything was all set. All I needed to do was go to their office and get my passport and do the ceremony.

It's not right for me to represent the country I refuged from.\\" He went on to say, \\"If I ran for Sudan, I would be betraying my people. I would be dishonoring the two million people who died for our freedom.\\" The IOC-executive board announced its decision on 20 July to allow Marial to participate as an Independent Olympic Athlete. Marial's travel documentation could not reach him in time, and so he could not march in the Opening Ceremony on 27 July. Marial finished 47th in the marathon, with a time of 2:19:32. His personal best is 2:12:55. He competed at the 2012 Olympics using his adopted name of Marial, which was the surname of his uncle, however he has since reverted to his birth name.

Isleta Isleta mission in 1880 In 1612 Juan de Salas came to New Mexico with Ordo√±ez. He became a missionary at the San Agust√≠n de la Isleta Mission in Isleta Pueblo, New Mexico, just south of the modern city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Fray Salas erected the \\"convent\\" of Isleta, in late 1612, early 1613. In 1629 the mission was visited by Jumano Indians from a region further south and east of Albuquerque. The visiting natives reported that they had been visited by a \\"Woman in Blue\\", and she had told them to ask for religious instruction. Some say the Jumanos were mainly interested in gaining protection from Apaches. At that time, the nun Mar√≠a de √Ågreda was living in a convent in √Ågreda, in Spain, and was known for falling into ecstatic trances. Between 1620 and 1623, she often said she was \\"transported by the aid of the angels\\" to settlements of people called Jumanos, and these reported visits continued in subsequent years, although less often. In 1629 the friars at Isleta received an inquiry from Spain about whether the Indians had reported visitations by a nun, and they immediately identified the \\"Woman in Blue\\" with Mar√≠a de Agreda. Jumanos missions Salas and Fray Diego Le√≥n visited the Jumanos country in July 1629, about to the ESE of Isleta, working with them for several months. When de Salas and L√≥pez reached the Jumanos they found that they already had a good understanding of Christian teachings, which they put down to the work of the Lady in Blue. They therefore baptized all the ten thousand members of the tribe without further instruction. They also healed many sick people through the power of their religion. While there, they received requests for teaching from tribes further to the east. In 1632 Salas, Father Juan de Ortega and a small party of soldiers traveled to Jumano country near to what is now San Angelo, Texas. They named the river on which the Jumanas lived the Rio de Nueces because of the nuts that grew beside it. Salas returned to Santa Fe, and Ortega followed him after six months. Later events Fray Salas was recorded as priest at Cuaray in 1643. Later the route into Texas taken by Juan de Salas was to be followed by the Castillo-Martin expedition of 1650 and the Diego de Guadalajara expedition of 1654. The Spanish took an increasing interest in the region. They built missions, and eventually built the town of San Angelo, Texas near the site of Salas's mission.

Kov√°cs (2012 photo) S√°ndor J. Kov√°cs (born August 17, 1947) is a Hungarian-American academic cardiologist and cardiovascular physiologist, best known for his work on the physiological dynamics of the human heart. He is a professor of medicine, physics, physiology, and biomedical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. Early life and education Born in Budapest, Hungary, Kov√°cs, with his parents and sister, fled Hungary at the time of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. His earliest memories are of scarcity and hardship during the communist era. The family was interned in Austrian refugee camps until 1959, when they were allowed to immigrate to Brooklyn, New York. As Kov√°cs recalled in an interview, Kov√°cs graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School and earned a B.S. in engineering at Cornell University in 1969. He then went to Caltech, where he initially studied theoretical and applied mechanics, transferred to physics and worked with Kip S. Thorne, receiving a Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1977. The title of his thesis was \\"The Generation of Gravitational Waves\\".Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, \\"Sandor J. Kovacs\\" While at Caltech, he was influenced by many interactions with Richard Feynman and George Zweig, when the latter was interested in the physics and physiology of human hearing. Determined to change from theoretical physics to medicine, Kov√°cs entered an accelerated Ph.D. to M.D. program at the University of Miami that awarded him a medical degree after 22 months of concentrated study, in 1979. Career Kov√°cs' subsequent career has been entirely at Washington University in St. Louis. After an internship and residency at Barnes Hospital, he became an instructor in medicine in 1985, served as director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the St Louis VA Medical Center (1985-1990) advancing through the ranks to professor of medicine, with also appointments in physiology, biomedical engineering, and physics, in 2007. The Kov√°cs research group is primarily a theory group which has pioneered conceptual frameworks for analyzing diastole by incorporating and kinematically modeling the suction pump role of the heart, and the dynamics of the four-chambered heart in the space of coordinates spanned by P (pressure), V (volume), and their time rates of change dP/dt and dV/dt. They then seek to validate the model predictions using human, in vivo physiologic measurements of pressures (high fidelity transducers) and flows (echocardiography) of masses and volumes of heart chambers (cardiac MRI).Gwen Ericson, \\"How do you measure a broken heart? Researchers find long-sought answer\\", Washington University in St. Louis Newsroom, Sept. 14, 2006 Among the results from this work is that the so-called third heart sound, \\"S3\\", formerly taught to be pathological, is actually produced by all hearts, but is merely below the threshold of hearing of most physicians.Manson AL.

Physiology (Modeling in Physiology) 1997:H1527-H1536. Additional advances include the 'Parametrized Diastolic Filling (PDF) Formalism' wherein the early, mechanical suction-initiated rapid filling portion of diastole (the echocardiographic Doppler E-wave) is modeled kinematically in analogy to the recoil, from rest, of a damped simple harmonic oscillator. The linearity of the model allows solution of the inverse problem of diastole, using the digitized clinical Doppler E-wave contour as input, and obtaining unique values of the PDF parameters, that characterize load, viscosity/relaxation and chamber stiffness for each E-wave analyzed as output.Kov√°cs SJ, Jr., Barzilai B, Perez J.

It was completed in 1891. The once-thriving Jewish community of Helena declined to the point that by the 1930s they could no longer maintain the building, and it was sold to the State of Montana, which added a second floor, converted it to office space and removed most religious symbolism from the building, though kept the unique stained glass windows. Eventually, the building fell into disuse by the state other than storage space, and so it was purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Helena, which owns it today and uses it to house their administrative offices. While the Jewish communities of Montana have always been small, they have become more active and visible in recent decades. Building history Construction of the temple began in 1890, with the cornerstone laid by Montana governor Joseph K. Toole, and was completed in 1891. Architects Heinlein and Mathias used granite, porphyry and sandstone in the construction to create the building, which could hold as many as 500 people. It is built in Neo-Romanesque style with keyhole windows and stained glass. The original building also featured a 30-foot high ceiling in the sanctuary, and two large \\"onion\\"-style domes outside capping the towers placed on either side of the front entrance, making it an example of Moorish Revival architecture. However, after the turn of the 20th century, the congregation fell upon hard economic times, and by the 1930s the Jewish population of Helena was too small to maintain the building. The leader of the remaining congregation, Norman Winestine, arranged to sell off the organ and pews to the Seventh-Day Adventists, and the State of Montana bought the temple itself for $1, promising to use the building for \\"a good and social purpose.\\" The state remodeled the building in 1935-1936, adding a second floor over what had been the sanctuary, removed the onion domes, as well as most of the religious symbols on the exterior, some by sandblasting. The stained glass windows, however, were preserved. The state used the building to house the offices of the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. The temple was not actively used from 1976‚Äì1980, serving as a storage space for the Montana Historical Society. Winestine, still living, feared it would be torn down. But in 1980 the Catholic Diocese of Helena bought it for approximately $83,000, and today it serves as the headquarters for the Diocese offices, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. In 2001, a plaque commemorating the synagogue was placed on the outside of the building, which continues to be well-maintained by the Diocese. History of Helena's Jewish community Cornerstone of the temple, inscribed with the Hebrew calendar year of its founding During the Montana Gold Rush hundreds of Jewish people came to Montana, many of them to Helena. The early Jewish settlers to Helena were mostly of German origin, hailing from Prussia, Bavaria, and Austria, as well some from Poland. Forming a mutual aid organization called the United Hebrew Benevolent Society in 1866, they became a major economic force in the city, owning 17 of Helena's 20 dry goods stores by 1867. In 1871, merchant Jacob Feldberg was nicknamed \\"Helena's Paul Revere for his courage in organizing a bucket brigade that saved his entire neighborhood from a fire. In 1877, twenty percent of Helena's Board of Trade was Jewish, and the owner of the International Hotel, Marcus Lissner, served six terms on the Helena City Council. Lissner's hotel repeatedly burned during the many fires that plagued Helena's business district in the 1860s and 1870s, yet he rebuilt it each time until it was nicknamed \\"The Phoenix.\\" Other members of Helena's Jewish community made significant contributions to the city, such as Josephine Israel, who not only supported the building of the temple, but also was the founder of Shodair Children's Hospital. On a purchasing trip to New York, Helena merchant Herman Gans convinced Rabbi Samuel Schulman to move to Helena. Rabbi Schulman was from Berlin and brought German Reform Judaism along. Rabbi Schulman and Gans were heavily involved in building Helena's temple. The United Hebrew Benevolent Society also developed the Home of Peace Cemetery, which, due to the large numbers of Jewish people who left Helena (and much of Montana) during the Great Depression, now contains more bodies than the current living Jewish population of Helena. In nearby Butte, Montana, the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Butte followed, in 1881. The Butte Jewish community formed Congregation B'Nai Israel in 1897, completing their Temple 1903. Montana's Jewish community today Commemorative marker, placed 2001 by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, showing original building design with domes that were removed in the 1930s remodel of the building Stained glass windows of the Temple were preserved during the Depression-era remodeling of the building Temple B'Nai Israel still holds services in Butte, but the Helena Jewish community does not have a Temple at present. In 2008, there were only about 1,000 self-identified Jews in Montana, a state with a population of about 900,000. The largest number are in Bozeman, where Rabbi Allen Secher was for a long time the only rabbi in the state. He retired in 2008. Other active Jewish communities, mostly Reform Judaism in affiliation, are found in Great Falls, Billings, the Flathead valley and Whitefish, Helena, Missoula, and Butte. They operate under the Montana Association of Jewish Communities, or \\"MAJCO\\". The Bozeman Jewish community includes amongst its membership Franke Wilmer, a state representative who was a Democratic primary election candidate for Congress in the 2012 election. In recent years, there have also been efforts to bring Chabad-Lubavitch has also opened up branches in the state, beginning with the 2006 arrival of Rabbi Chaim Bruk, originally from Brooklyn, in Bozeman and Rabbi Berry Nash in Missoula in 2014. In 2008, local interest in Judaism was revived when the city of Helena bought a surplus bomb-sniffing dog for the price of a plane ticket from the Israel Defense Forces, who had gotten the puppy from an animal shelter in The Netherlands, but upon arrival, the Helena police department discovered the dog only responded to Hebrew commands and, though given a printed vocabulary list of commands, the officer in charge of the dog could not get \\"Miky\\" the German Shepherd to respond. When Rabbi Bruk came to the state capitol for a Hanukkah ceremony, the officer asked him some questions. Bruk taught the officer how to correctly pronounce Hebrew and then Miky began to respond.

In 1963‚Äì1972 the teaching hospital of the university was the Oulu provincial hospital. The hospital serves as the central hospital for Northern Ostrobothnia region. It was previously named as Oulu University Central Hospital (). The hospital is owned and operated by the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District () which is a joint municipal authority responsible for production of specialized medical services in the region. It also owns and operates two other hospitals: Oulaskangas Hospital in Oulainen and Visala Hospital in Ylivieska. At the turn of the 1990s, the Oulunsuu hospital and Heikinharju hospital were attached to the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District and they became OYS Psychiatry. History Before the establishment of the university hospital most of the medical services in Oulu were based in the old provincial hospital, but with new laws being put in place in the 1950s and the university opening with its medical teaching, it was decided to build a new university hospital. The ministry of the interior held a competition for Finnish architects in 1965 and it was won by Reino Koivula. The president of Finland at the time, Urho Kekkonen laid the cornerstone in december of 1968 and the facility was inagurated on september 3, 1976.

His father was Adornino Adorno and his mother Nicolosia della Rocca and his brother, Antoniotto, was elected four times as doge of the Republic. He was born c. 1350 but little is known about his youth except that he married Pietrina Montaldo, daughter of the doge Leonardo Montaldo. With her he had nine children including the future doge Raffaele Adorno. The Mandate In 1396, the Republic of Genoa had joined the French kingdom but regained its independence on March 21, 1413. The short-lived Government of the eight rectors rapidly gave way and Giorgio was elected doge less than a week later. On the diplomatic scene, Giorgio managed to regain some of the territories that had been given away by the French governor during the occupation. In particular, the Republic bought back numerous castles and villages from the Marquesse of Monferat, and the Republic of Florence and regained control of the lower Piedmont and the Riviera. An important step in the effort to stabilize the Republic was the promulgation of the new constitution. The main points of the new regime were the greater influence granted to the doge in the system, and the official allegiance to the Ghibelline fraction. In case of vacancy of the dogeship, the sovereignty of the Republic was to pass to the council of the Twelve Ancients. Genovino minted during the mandate of Giorgio Adorno.  The Civil War  Noble families had been locked in a series of conflict for several decades. The crisis came to an acme when Isnardo Guarco organized a revolt in the newly reconquered territories near Tuscany. But the rebellion was quickly sedated. In December 1414, Battista Montaldo led a strong Guelph faction constituted of the Spinola, Vivaldi, Grilli, Negroni, Da Mare and Imperiali families against the Ghibelline families (Fregoso, Giustiniani, Promontorio, Soprani) who supported the Adorno dogeship. Street battles and homicides unfolded despite the calls for peace by the Archbishop. Noble families that owned large tract of land along the Rivieras as well as the Apennines and the Oltregiogo (e.g. Fieschi and Doria), took part in the street riots according to their own interests. Even the communities in these regions participated in the conflict, siding with factions such as the Doria- Campofregoso and Spinola-Adorno in Savona. Finally, in the early months of 1415 a truce was reached but to avoid being ousted, the doge demanded help from the Duke of Milan who sent 300 soldiers. In retaliation, the Guelph fraction asked help from the Marquesse of Monferrat. Faced with the collapse of the city, Barnaba di Guano, Giacomo Giustiniani and Antonio Doria gathered in the cathedral of Saint Lawrence and called for the end of the conflict. Finally, they managed to convince Giorgio to renounce the dogeship. He resigned on March 1415. The rule of the Republic was left to the Government of the Two Priors, Tommaso di Campofregoso and Jacopo Giustiniani. Once ousted, Giorgio Adorno obtained the governorship of Caffa and a yearly stipend of 300 ducats.

Biography Mangold was born in Darmstadt and received his initial musical education from his father. In 1831 he entered the orchestra of the ducal chapel at Darmstadt. A journey to London in 1834 acquainted him with the work of Handel. From 1835 he appeared in Darmstadt not only as a violinist, but also as a singer. Between 1836 and 1839 he studied at the Paris Conservatory and made the acquaintance of Berlioz, Chopin, Meyerbeer, Liszt, and Clara Wieck. After his return to Darmstadt in 1839 he became the director of the local \\"Musikverein\\", which in the course of the following years performed all of his major oratorio and cantata works. In 1848, he was made \\"Hofmusikdirektor\\" (court music director) at Darmstadt Castle. His second opera, Tannh√§user (1845), was written at the same time as Wagner's work of the same title, but without mutual knowledge. Apparently, performances of Mangold's work beyond Darmstadt were hampered out of consideration for Wagner.Ursula Kramer: \\"Mangold (Familie)\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part, vol. 11, cc. 973‚Äì5.

Directed by Nils Gaup, it was written by Sergio Donati and loosely based on Henry Wilson Allen's 1956 Western novel The North Star. Lambert executive produced the film. Plot summary At the beginning of the Nome Gold Rush in 1899, Sean McLennon (Caan), a Scots-Irish- American land baron, owns the majority of property titles surrounding Nome and declares that only American citizens are legally entitled to placer claims. He uses power, influence and nationalism to make local politics and law enforcement work in his favor. Unbeknownst to those outside of McLennon's gang, the original owners of the land were all killed on McLennon's orders. The gang's latest target, Hudson Santeek (Lambert) narrowly escapes the attempt on his life but not before witnessing McLennon's right-hand thug, Reno (Burt Young) murder Santeek's adoptive father - an elderly Athabaskan tribal chief - in cold blood. Santeek, who is half white and half American Indian, had \\"purchased\\" his surrogate family's land in a bid to keep miners away. Santeek returns to Nome to confront McLennon at knifepoint in his bedroom, but Sarah (McCormack) McLennon's young Irish immigrant trophy wife, intervenes at gunpoint; McLennon disarms Santeek and the two engage in a fight. After Santeek floors McLennon, he kidnaps Sarah, steals a dogsled and rides off into the Alaskan wilderness. Without the permission of the local sheriff, McLennon forms a posse and treks out into the tundra to kill Santeek and rescue his wife. On the course of the journey, Santeek talks to his captive about her husband's murderous property deed scams, but she does not immediately believe him and re-avows her loyalty to her husband. However, when McLennon and his men locate Santeek's cabin hideout and shoot at it indiscriminately, Sarah pleas for her husband not to kill her abductor. McLennon notices that she is wearing a shirt made of animal skin that Santeek had given to her earlier to keep her warm. He erroneously assumes that she betrayed him and had an affair with Santeek. Calling her a \\"whore,\\" he disowns her and orders his men to continue firing at Santeek's cabin. Santeek escapes while his pet wolf fatally lunges at the throat of one of the posse gunmen. Santeek's wolf then attacks the gang's sled dogs, but Reno shoots and kills the animal. With no clear objective and unfamiliarity with the freezing, unpredictable terrain, members of McLennon's posse begin to turn on one another, but McLennon kills the burnouts in his gang and sets out to finish the job he started. Meanwhile, back in Nome, Col. Henry Johnson (Jacques Francois) and the U.S. Marshals begin their own investigation of McLennon's land seizures, noticing that all of the original trustees are mysteriously deceased and that Santeek (the most recent disseisee) was witnessed in town alive. On the basis of this discrepancy, the federals declare Martial Law on Nome and accompany the town's top lawman, Sheriff Lamont (Nicholas Hope) to bring McLennon and Santeek back for questioning. The enforcers locate McLennon and his gang, but McLennon refuses to obey their orders and the posse shoot Lamont and the other officials to death. McLennon and the surviving members of his gang eventually track and corner Santeek in a glacier cave. While Santeek scuffles with Reno, McLennon tips over a wood totem and Reno and Santeek slide down and fall through the sheath of a frozen lake. Reno drowns during the struggle, while Santeek, with his naturalist survival skills, makes it out of the icy water alive. Once again thinking that Santeek is dead, McLennon returns to Nome alone and conducts another town speech, reaffirming his mining policies to the chagrin of immigrant prospectors and the delight of his cronies. However, Johnson and the U.S. Marshals interrupt the huddle and arrest McLennon for the murder of sheriff Lamont and the other constables. Sarah, McLennon's disillusioned wife, had witnessed the massacre and ultimately informed on him. Soon after, Santeek returns to town to settle scores with the incarcerated McLennon, but finds the former had escaped from his cell and slit the throats of the jailguards in the process. McLennon breaks into his loft apartment (above the saloon which he had owned) and attempts to kill Sarah for turning on him, but Santeek appears behind McLennon and plunges a dagger into his back.

History The first school in Liskeard was founded in 1550 on Castle Hill, later site of a Civil War battlefield. For a time it was maintained by the Earls of St Germans, but it closed around 1834 due to a decline in numbers and financial difficulties. From 1835 a series of private schools existed in the borough, until 1908 when the Cornwall Education Committee built the County School at Old Road. From 1945 it was known as Liskeard Grammar School until September 1978 when it became the Lower School site of Liskeard School, following amalgamation with the town's secondary modern school. Liskeard County Secondary School received its first pupils on Monday 12 September 1960, and was formally opened by the Minister of Education, Sir David Eccles on 7 July the following year. Costing ¬£100,000, it was built to accommodate around 500 pupils on the site of the current school at Luxstowe. Its glass and steel structure made \\"free use of fresh air and sunlight\\" according to local newspaper reports, whilst other modern features included a well-equipped gymnasium, automated central heating and synchronised clocks across the school, operated from the secretary's office. A new block was opened by the Right Honourable Margaret Thatcher, Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1974, following the raising of the school leaving age from 15 years to 16, two years earlier. Like many similar secondary schools in Cornwall, from the late 1970s it housed the Upper School (3rd Year / Year 9 upwards), when it merged with the town's grammar school to create a split-site comprehensive school. Today, with increased pupil numbers requiring many to be taught in temporary buildings, the need for improvements to Liskeard's secondary and primary schools was being raised in Parliament. By the late 1990s, Liskeard School and Community College had been extended at Luxstowe Site, and the Old Road site closed and redeveloped for housing. A further multi-million pound technology facilities were added in 2002, and the original buildings were completely updated by 2011. Formerly Cornwall's only school with an engineering speciality, it now caters for approximately 1100 students aged between 11 and 19, and employs around 200 teaching and non-teaching, full- and part-time staff. It also has an advice and information service, a centre for children with autism and a Sixth Form College offering A-Levels and Level 3 Qualifications. The current headteacher is Alex Lingard, who took over from Donna Bryant in 2014. In 2017 the school began the process of establishing a Multi-Academy Trust with other schools in South East Cornwall. They will convert to an academy trust on 1 April 2017.

It was located just to the west of Flagler Beach, Florida.  History  Built in the early 1930s on the narrow barrier island almost directly on the Atlantic coast. It consisted of 2 marl runways 3,200' northwest/southeast & 3,000' north/south. It appears there may have been a small hangar and a building, located directly next to the beach with a parking ramp. During World War II, the airport was initially used by the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command which flew light observation planes over the Atlantic looking for Nazi U-Boats. In 1943, the Navy took over the anti-submarine mission and the Civil Air Patrol operated observation aircraft from the field. After the war ended, the airport was closed sometime in 1945 or 1946. It remains abandoned to this day, the land being owned by the Flagship Harbor Preserve. The outlines of the runways are clearly delineated in aerial imagery.

Hogan was a member of the Republican Party, and previously sat on the Colorado House of Representatives between 1975 and 1977. Early life and career Hogan was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, on May 31, 1948. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Denver in 1970. In 1970 and 1971, he went to the University of Nebraska College of Law.http://data.denverpost.com/election/candidates/steve- hogan/City Mourning Loss of Mayor Hogan Specializing in transport management, Hogan was the executive director of the E-470 Public Highway Authority from 1991 to 1998, leaving that year to run the Northwest Parkway Authority until 2008. Political career Elected in 1974, Hogan was a one-term legislator in the Colorado House of Representatives representing the 40th district, which covered most of the Arapahoe County portion of Aurora. At this stage a member of the Democratic Party, Hogan made a run in 1979 for the Aurora City Council, winning in what he described as 'the most competitive council election in decades'. His victory marked the first of six non-consecutive terms as a councilman (1979‚Äì1983, 1985‚Äì1997, 2001‚Äì09). Outside of the city council, Hogan has twice been a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives; the first in 1982, when he was the Democratic nominee in the 6th district against Republican Jack Swigert of Apollo 13 fame, emphasizing his political experience compared to political novice Swigert. Swigert emerged victorious, but died from cancer before he could assume office, and Hogan once more represented the Democrats in the 1983 special election that followed. He ran on a campaign criticizing the economic and defense policies of President Ronald Reagan, whilst advocating higher taxes to reduce the federal deficit, and lost to Republican state senator Dan Schaefer. At some stage becoming a Republican, Hogan made a second run for the Aurora mayoralty (the first being a failed attempt in 1987) in 2011. He took advantage of his image as an adept budget manager, and was described in The Denver Post as a man with a 'reputation as problem-solver and capable manager' in its endorsement. In the 6-person race, Hogan was seen as the establishment candidate, enjoying bipartisan support, including from the local branch of the AFL-CIO, and won the November election with 37% of the vote. His mayoralty received international attention when twelve people were killed during the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting. Awards and recognition Hogan has been the recipient of several awards, including: the Martin Luther King Jr. Award from the City of Aurora; Outstanding Legislator from the Colorado Chapter of Disabled American Veterans; the Community Leadership Award from the Aurora Chamber of Commerce; and the Circle of Life Award from the Northern Aurora Business Association. An extension of East 6th Avenue from SH 30 to just west of the 6th Parkway/E-470 interchange that opened on September 26, 2019 was named ‚ÄúStephen D. Hogan Parkway‚Äù in his honor. Personal life and death Hogan served on the Aurora Chamber of Commerce and the Aurora Economic Development Council. He lived in the High Point neighborhood with his wife, Becky.

The monument was created in 1998 by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal State of Berlin. It is located on Bernauer Stra√üe at the corner of Ackerstra√üe and includes a Chapel of Reconciliation, the Berlin Wall Documentation Centre, a section of the former border, a window of remembrance and a visitor center. History The idea of a memorial was suggested by the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historical Museum) on behalf of the federal government of Berlin, and architects Kohlhoff & Kohlhoff were commissioned to design it. The cost of the competition and completion was 2.2 million Marks. The federal government took over the construction costs, while the state covers the maintenance costs. On 11 September 2008 the Berlin House of Representatives approved the opening of the memorial on the anniversary of the day that the Berlin Wall fell. By 2013, an extension was to be completed. Original relics of the border were to be shown, with missing parts marked in steel on the ground. The memorial was to be divided into four areas: *The wall and the Todesstreifen (death strip) *Destruction of the city *Building of the wall *\\"Es geschah an der Mauer\\" (It happened at the wall) At the corner of Gartenstra√üe and Bernauer Stra√üe, a visitor centre was opened. The outdoor area of the memorial west of Berlin Nordbahnhof was transformed into an Erinnerungslandschaft (memorial landscape). In 2006 there were over 220,000 visitors to the documentation centre, which is part of the memorial. Part of the memorial is located on Ackerstra√üe. Description =Original wall= Part of the remaining section of the Berlin Wall The memorial includes a long section of the wall as it was when the Wall fell. Seen from the west, a wall built from L-elements was lined by a sandy section, a lighted \\"Kolonnenweg\\", a signal fence, and an inner wall. Finally a tower was built within the complex. The area is not accessible to visitors; both ends of the original wall are closed by stainless steel. The northern wall bears the inscription \\"In Erinnerung an die Teilung der Stadt vom 13. August 1961 bis zum 9. November 1989 und zum Gedenken an die Opfer kommunistischer Gewaltherrschaft\\" (\\"In memory of the city's division from 13 August 1961 to 9 November 1989 and of the victims of communist tyranny\\"). =Documentation centre= The documentation centre is located on the other side of Bernauer Stra√üe. It contains seminar rooms and exhibitions. The building includes a five-story observation tower. =Chapel of Reconciliation= The Chapel of Reconciliation was designed by architects Peter Roth and Rudolph Sass as a church and is oval in shape with a fa√ßade of wooden rods. The chapel includes a prayer room and materials from the former Vers√∂hnungskirche (reconciliation church), which stood on the site until it was destroyed in 1985 because it was inside the border strip.

Each of the cores had 40 residential units. The floor plans are organized so that each floor could have either two 4-bedroom apartments (front facing) and two 1-bedroom apartments (rear facing) or two 3-bedroom apartments (front facing) and two 2-bedroom apartments (rear facing) side by side. There are four balconies at each entrance of the entrance opposite side. Depending on the type of apartment they are the 2/3/4 assigned room apartments. The bathrooms are of the smaller type taken from the P2 building type, and could be used at any of the risers in the plan. The kitchens share a back-to-back plumbing riser with the baths, and are accessible only through the living room.

Part of the chordophonic lute family of instruments, the Swarabat body is made of wood on which a skin is stretched. On top of this skin, a bridge is placed upon which silk strings pass, which are plucked with a plectrum carved out of horn. There is a resonator and a stem, both made of wood. The resonator is covered with animal hide. The frets were made from animal gut (usually a goat). The head resembles a parrot or peacock. The tuning pegs are fixed to the neck. Sound Although the Swarabat features a unique construction, the range of sound delivered by it is relatively limited. It produces a timbre similar to a bass rubab and bass guitar. Use and history The Swarabat is today a very rare string instrument used in Carnatic music, that once featured prominently as an original staple in the Katcheri and Harikatha stage ensembles of royal carpet composers. Musicians in the royal courts of Mysore, Travancore, Thanjavur kingdom and the Thondaman dynasty of Pudukottai favoured its unique bass tone accompaniment; students of the Saraswati veena were often proficient in playing the Swarabat. Old manuscripts, photographs and Swarabat instruments themselves have been preserved at museums worldwide. Prolific musicians who have played it have been Palghat Parameswara Bhagavathar, Baluswami Dikshitar, the Raja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, Veene Sheshanna, and Krishna Iyengar.

Early life and stage career Wieth was born as Carl Andersen in Copenhagen to Marius Hans Lindegaard Andersen, who was a judge, and his wife Jacobine Kirstine Wieth Andersen.Det Danske Film Database He would begin his acting career after adding an \\"o\\" to his given name of Carl and taking his mother's maiden name. He was educated at the Royal Danish Theatre from 1903 to 1905 and made his stage debut in 1905. He was an actor at the Danish Royal Theatre from 1905 to 1907, 1908 to 1909 and again from 1923 to 1943. From 1907 to 1908 and 1909 to 1910, he was engaged as an actor at the Dagmar Theatre, from 1911 to 1922 at the Folketeatret, and spent a year at the Betty Nansen Teatret beginning in 1922 before traveling abroad. Film career Wieth made his film debut in 1910 for Kinografen before spending nearly the entirety of his film career at Nordisk Film. In 1911, he appeared in the controversial August Blom-directed Mormonens offer (A Victim of the Mormons). The film was controversial for demonizing the Mormon religion, and its box-office success is cited for initiating a decade of anti-Mormon propaganda films in America.Wollheim, Peter Latter-day screens: a history of Mormons and the movies, AfterFile: The Journal of Media Arts and Cultural Criticism, Issue 33, 2006, pp. 26-29Astle, Randy A Victim of the Mormons Mormon Literature & Creative Arts, Brigham Young University, 2003 The film tells the story of an attractive young woman who is seduced and kidnapped by a Mormon missionary, then forced to accompany him to Utah to become one of his wives. The film became a hit, in part due to the publicity from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' objections and its failed campaign to ban the film.Wollstein, Hans J. Mormonens Offer (1911) New York Times 2008 Between 1912 and 1914, he appeared in approximately nine Swedish silent films for such directors as John Ekman, Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sj√∂str√∂m before returning to Denmark and appearing in such films as Gunnar Sommerfeldt's 1918 drama En Lykkeper in 1918 and in Carl Theodor Dreyer's popular 1921 silent drama Leaves from Satan's Book, which tells the tale of Satan's banishment from heaven. Leaves Out of the Book of Satan would be Wieth's last silent film before returning to the stage. He wouldn't return to the screen until appearing in his first talkie; P√°l Fej√∂s's 1935 Det gyldne smil (The Golden Smile) opposite Bodil Ipsen. He would appear in approximately ten sound films before his death. His last film was in the 1943 romantic comedy Vi kunde ha' det saa rart, opposite Bodil Kjer. Personal life Wieth was at various times a member of the Danish Arts Council, the International Union of Actors, and Vice President of the Danish Actors' Union. Carlo Wieth was married twice; his first marriage was to Danish stage and screen actress Clara Pontoppidan from 1906 to 1917. The pair had appeared in several films together. Wieth and Pontoppidan divorced and produced no offspring. His second marriage was to actress Agnes Thorberg Wieth (n√©e Sommer) in 1917. The couple had a son, actor Mogens Wieth. Carlo and Agnes would remain married until Wieth's death. Death On 30 June 1943, Wieth was on a bicycle excursion in the Gribskov forest in the Hovedstaden region on Zealand when he collapsed from a fatal heart attack, aged 57. He was interred at the Vestre Cemetery in Copenhagen.

Early life Edward Francis Anhalt was born to Jack and Sadye (n√©e Moskol) Anhalt. Anhalt earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a Master of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and a doctoral degree from Rutgers University. Anhalt taught at Muhlenberg College, and also taught as a professor of business at Cardinal Stritch University and presently is Dean of Education at International University for Graduate Studies. Career =Banking on Kids= Anhalt is the president of Banking On Kids, a company that helps K-8 students become fiscally prudent by opening student-run-banks in their schools. Founded in 1995 by Anhalt, his initiatives represented an example of local banks becoming involved in elementary and middle school education: In 1999, the organization started programs in 75 schools with the help of 15 banks in the Milwaukee area. The program, which is curricular- driven, sets many goals for students, such as opening their own savings account. Anhalt believes the program is beneficial because it helps students set financial habits early on.Turning Kids Into Good Consumers and Employees, b3:Build Better Business, pp. 18-19, January/February 1999 Anhalt has also stated that another goal of the organization is to reduce the use of check- cashing services, which he called \\"legalized loan sharking.\\" Such services take a significant percentage cut from the value of the check, and Anhalt argues that more emphasis needs to be placed on individuals saving money and using banks. =Event promotion and coordinating= Under his organization, Just Like Downtown, Anhalt marketed, promoted, and coordinated several promotional events in the Milwaukee area. For instance, he promoted several \\"best of\\" contests featuring local foods such as frozen custard, fish frys, and pizza. He also organized and promoted the idea for the Park-it Market at County Stadium in 1982, which was a flea market described as \\"Milwaukee's biggest rummage sale ever.\\" The event attracted 600 sellers and an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 attendees. Anhalt was noted for his atypical promotional strategy, such as using WBCS radio as a method to advertise the event. Anhalt is also responsible for orchestrating or promoting numerous events in the Milwaukee area: *Selling sod from the Milwaukee County Stadium following the 1982 World Series, *The Milwaukee Amusement Players Expo, a video game convention, * Originating the annual Milwaukee Math Game events in 1993 while a consultant at the Greater Milwaukee Education Trust. * Originating the annual Milwaukee Reading Promise Game in 1999 while a consultant at the Greater Milwaukee Education Trust. He previously served as the development manager for the Milwaukee County Department of Parks, Recreation, and Culture, Marketing Director for the King Solomon Mines in Eilat, Israel, and Education Consultant for the Greater Milwaukee Education Trust.

Plot  The play features two parallel plots dealing with rivalries in love. It contains disguises, duels and complex intrigues. The main plot revolves around Do√±a Ana de Contreras who is courted by both Don Juan and Don Mendo. While the latter is portrayed as handsome and dashing, his tricks and calumnies directed at his rival point to his negative side. Don Juan, on the other hand, is an impoverished nobleman, who depicts himself as unattractive and not worthy of Ana's Diana-like beauty. As the action advances, Juan proves himself to be forthright and persevering. At first, Do√±a Ana intends to marry Don Mendo, not realizing his many flaws, but she slowly begins to suspect that he is not what he seems. In Act II, after undertaking some devotional rituals in honor of San Diego, she returns home early to hear Don Mendo disparage her in front of Don Juan, who defends her. In Act III don Mendo decides to counter her growing indifference and even dislike, by forcing himself upon her. This turns her completely against him. The secondary plot involves Don Mendo's mendacity as he tries to hide from Lucrecia the fact that he is scheming to marry Ana. Lucrecia is also courted by a Count who seeks to enlighten her about Mendo. While the action begins with a passionate and irrational love on the part of both Ana and Lucrecia, it ends with rational love based on the qualities of the men they eventually choose to marry: Juan and the Count.WHICKER, Jules, The Plays of Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n, London: Tamesis, 2003. p. 80. The denouement of the main plot shows how don Mendo's predilection for slanderous remarks cause him to lose the love of Ana and Lucrecia as well as the friendship and patronage of the Duke of Urbino.\\" Adaptations In 1974, a French adaptation was created by Eduardo Manet, and titled L'Autre Don Juan.

The bog straddles the German/Czech border; the part lying in the German state of Saxony has been protected since 1930, whilst the Czech part (6.02 hectares) was declared a nature reserve in 1962. Winter at the Kleiner Kranichsee near Johanngeorgenstadt  Location  The raised bog is located at an elevation of 930 metres above sea level (NN) in a clearing in the highland forest southwest of the town of Johanngeorgenstadt. The border between Germany and the Czech Republic runs through the bog and continues over the mountain of Buchschachtelberg.  Name  The name of the raised bog is linked to the Czech word granica \\"meaning border\\". The Kleiner Kranichsee was first mentioned in historical records in 1551.  Significance  It is a watershed- and krummholz raised bog that is drained towards the north by the Steinbach stream, to the west by the Gro√üe Bockau, to the south through the Buchschachtel ditch and to the east by the Lehmergrundbach stream. To the west lies the Gro√üer Kranichsee (\\"Great Kranich Lake\\"), a bog whose heart lies on the Czech side of the border.

They are often used by quantitative investors to make best estimation of the movement of equity prices, such as stock prices, options prices, or other types of derivatives.  History  The early history of financial signal processing can be traced back to Isaac Newton. Newton lost money in the famous South Sea Company investment bubble. The modern start of financial signal processing is often credited to Claude Shannon. Shannon was the inventor of modern communication theory. He discovered the capacity of a communication channel by analyzing entropy of information. For a long time, financial signal processing technologies have been used by different hedge funds, such as Jim Simon's Renaissance Technologies. However, hedge funds usually do not reveal their trade secrets. Some early research results in this area are summarized by R.H. T√ºt√ºnc√º and M.

It is also known as Kokna, Kokni, and Kukna. There are various opinions regarding the origin of this tribe since no adequate research has been made. They are recognized as a scheduled tribe in the Indian states of Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.Demographic Status of Scheduled Tribe Population of India, Minitry of Tribal Affairs, India  Social Life  Kokna-Kokni tribal society is an important society of ancient primitive culture and its social, economic, cultural and political life is characteristic. Considering the total population of the Kokna tribe, it can be seen that Kokna is the major tribe in Maharashtra. Although there are few historical references available regarding the origin of tribe from socio- cultural point of view, their current social customs and cultural practices confirm their primitiveness. Interest and improvements in agriculture has resulted in prosperity and social stability of the tribe. Apart from this, the social status of the Koknas has remained high due to land ownership. Due to their high socio-economic status, the Kokna tribes consider themselves superior to other tribes.  Religion and Cultural Life  The religious beliefs and practices practiced by the tribals are also seen in the Kokna tribe i.e. religion is the belief in supernatural powers and divine beings. Along with God of water, God of fire and God of animals, the Kokna also believe in demons. Koknas are mostly nature worshipers. Therefore, their deities and places of worship are also subject to the nature. Since the Kokna has been settled in agriculture for many years, they believe that rain is the supreme god. Their deities are based on daily life relationships such as 'Dhantari' which gives grain, 'Gavkari' which is used for farm work and 'Kansari' which makes a living. Worship rituals are performed to please the deities at the beginning of any auspicious work or financial activity. Since nature is the foundation of the socio-economic life of the Konkan, their conceptions of religion and theology have also developed on the basis of nature. = Dongaridev Festival = The God of mountains (Dongaridev) is worshiped in the belief that God resides in a mountain cave and that his happiness and sadness affect the life's joys and sorrows. Dongaridev festival is celebrated by the whole villages and at least one person from each family in the village has to participate in this festival. 70-80 young and old people come together and dance in a circular motion and sing songs their dialect. Various instruments are used for worship in this festival viz. flags, ghoongru kaathi (stick with bells), pawri, tapra, many marigold flowers, nachani and rice grains. The festival usually lasts for eight to ten days and finally, on the night before the full moon, they go at the foot of the mountain, dance all night, sing kokni songs, and descend from the hill in the morning after worshiping the mountain. During this festival all the virtues of kindness, cordiality, generosity, honesty, discipline, community life, purity of mind are discovered. The efforts of the Kokna to inculcate human values in this way through festivals and traditions are incomparable.

Alongside Donald Carr, the school's captain, he was the school's main bowler, taking 43 wickets in 1944. No school side Repton played against during this period managed to make a score of at least 100 against them. After leaving Repton, he spent two years in the Royal Marines. After two years in the Marines he began his studies at the University of Cambridge. He made his first-class debut for Cambridge University Cricket Club against Sussex at Fenner's in 1949. He made eleven further first-class appearances for the university, the last of which came against Oxford University in The University Match at Lord's in 1950. In twelve first-class matches for the university, he took 26 wickets at an average of 35.46, with best figures of 3/24. With the bat, he scored 55 runs at a batting average of 9.16, with a high score of 25. In what was a strong Oxford University side of the time, no fewer than eight members of it would go on to represent England in Test cricket. He later briefly played first-class cricket for Sussex, making three appearances against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1951 and Worcestershire and Essex in the 1952 County Championship, with both matches played at The Saffrons, Eastbourne. However, he was not successful in these matches, taking just a single wicket, as well as scoring 17 runs. He then went into teaching, after which he never appeared in first-class cricket again.

In 1996 and 2000/01 he was Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Swissair and President of the SAir Group Executive Committee in the period from 1997 to 2001. The growth strategy pursued by him, which had aimed at establishing an own aviation alliance was largely responsible for the bankruptcy of Swissair in October 2001.  Biography  = Training and career = After attending primary school and the district school in Wohlen, he attended a seminary in Wettingen from 1964 to 1969, interrupted by a one- year stay as a visiting student in the United States. He then studied economics at the University of Basel as well as business and law at the University of Geneva. His professional career began in 1976 as Assistant Director-General of the Swiss Bank Corporation. In 1979, Bruggisser joined Swissair and worked as a controller. In 1984, he was appointed chief financial officer of the Swissair North America sector, and from 1987 to 1990 he was head of the controlling department. After a short stint as project manager of a profit improvement program, he took over the directorate chairman's post of Swissair Holdings AG in 1991, a position he held until 1995. In addition, from 1992 to 1994, he was a member of Swissair's management. Under Bruggisser's leadership Swissair acquired the catering section of SAS Scandinavian Airlines. In 1995 he was a member of the Swissair Group Executive Committee. = Swissair chief = In 1996, Bruggisser took over as chief operating officer for the operational management of the Group and also served as Deputy Chief Executive Officer. The following year, he undertook a comprehensive restructuring of the Group, the SAirGroup was created with Swissair now being one of several subsidiaries. In 1997, Bruggisser assumed the post of Executive President, the operational management of Swissair. After the project \\"Alcazar\\" - a group of Swissair, KLM, SAS and Austrian Airlines - had failed in 1993, he followed the advice of the management consultant McKinsey to up SAir's own alliance. This risky \\"Hunter Strategy\\" provided for the purchase of airline companies and investments. The first step in 1996 was a stake in Belgium's Sabena. Under the leadership of Swissair, the airline alliance Qualiflyer Group was founded in 1998. Other interests in the Italian Volare, Air Littoral of France and the German LTU were added. Initially positive annual results in 1997 and 1998 spurred the board to continue the strategy. The crash of Swissair Flight 111 overshadowed the fiscal year 1998. Delta Air Lines announced in 1999 the interruption of the cooperation with Swissair and Austrian Airlines and left the Qualiflyer Group. Despite these setbacks, Bruggisser held steadfastly to the Hunter strategy. It was followed by investments in the South African Airways, the French companies AOM, Air Littoral and Air Libert√©, the Italian Air Europe and the LOT Polish Airlines. He also initiated the purchase of interests in the Portuguese companies TAP and Portug√°lia. Most of these companies were in need of recapitalisation, so in addition to the purchase price, capital for restructuring had to be invested. In July 2000, Bruggisser temporarily took over the operational management of Swissair. He then came under public pressure, when the ailing financial situation of the SAir Group became known. On average, the daily loss of Swissair and Sabena Swiss Francs one million each, with another million going every day into LTU and the French interests. The administrative board began to order exit scenarios from the received shares in other airlines and dismissed Bruggisser in January 2001 with immediate effect. His successors, Moritz Suter and Mario Corti could not prevent the collapse of the Group in October 2001 and its liquidation in March 2002. = Aftermath = As a result, the press published that Bruggisser was primarily responsible for the expansion and the demise of Swissair. Bruggisser initially largely withdrew from public life. In November 2006, he failed in his attempt to be elected to the Board of the South African Airways. The prosecutor of the Canton of Zurich brought charges against Bruggisser and another 18 people in March 2006 in connection with the Swissair bankruptcy case. They were accused of forging documents, mismanagement and damage to creditors among other things. Bruggisser was charged with false certification. From 2009 to 2010 Brugisser was again active in the aviation industry as CEO and chairman of VistaJet.

The wife of the house begged the King for the life of her husband who was one of those to be tried by the King. The others were hanged, but the King dismissed the husband with the admonition \\"to be a better bairn.\\".

It is believed to have replaced an earlier chapel where the Senior Common Room now is, and includes items of silverware from around the date of foundation. The chapel is in a mixture of architectural styles - Gothic, neoclassical, and baroque - and has not proven uncontroversial for this reason. The current chaplain is The Reverend Julia Baldwin. Radcliffe having failed to start work during his lifetime, his will set aside money and instructions for the construction of the new chapel on the south side of the college. For this purpose materials were taken from college properties - particularly from St Mary's College, which provided the hammerbeam roof and other materials for the project. The chapel and library cost together ¬£4,000 at a time when college income was ¬£600 a year. Disputes over the will and other problems meant that work on the construction did not begin until 1656 (eight years after Radcliffe's death), and was managed by the college bursar. An \\"overseer\\" called John Jackson took control of the project, and is believed to be the chapel's primary designer. The chapel was consecrated in 1666, and must have been almost complete at that date. Various alterations were made to the chapel after completion. Although repairs were undertaken in the meantime, the interior of the chapel was renovated (having fallen into a poor state) in 1819, and the exterior beginning in 1841. In 1892-3 a new organ was purchased and fitted, paid for by the then Principal Charles Buller Heberden; the current organ was installed in 1973, and rebuilt in 2002-3\\\\. Early history Sketch from 1578, before the new chapel was built The original buildings took some time to finish; only the original gateway was lavished upon from the beginning. The buildings were only of a modest splendour: the hall was not completed until the end of the seventeenth century; the rooms economically decorated without wood panelling; the main quadrangle only of one story and garrets.Buchan (1898). p. 14.Crook (2008) p. 18‚Äì19. Although an earlier chapel is suspected, the area above Staircase I ‚Äì now the Senior Common Room ‚Äì was in use by 1521. It appears that the ecclesiastical furnishings promised by Smyth never arrived, and have been presumed taken by the college's first Visitor, Cardinal Wolsey. Although the chapel (or perhaps oratory) was plain, two chalices and two patens survived from the original three of each and have been identified as older than those of Corpus or Trinity, dating to the late fifteenth century. The college successfully navigated through the reformation period, despite the fact that the college retained strong Catholic tendencies, and support for the reforms of Henry VIII and Edward VIII was minimal. The chapel's dean, Thomas Hawarden, was opposed to the reforms, and was once called to the King's Privy Council to answer for his actions. Eventually, though, the continuing reforms were carried through; in particular, despite an exception for the University from the Act of Uniformity in 1549 for services other than mass, the enforcement of the Book of Common Prayer severely limited the ability of the college to maintain the old Catholic services whilst outwardly adopting the new reforms. The careful, and generally slow, path trod was exposed under Queen Mary, when five Fellows the left the college over its failings to reinstate the full Catholic mass quickly enough.Crook (2008) pp. 27‚Äì29. Under Thomas Blanchard and Richard Harris the college finally accepted the reglious reforms, and, moving into the later sixteenth century the college was responsible for housing several important figures of Protestantism: John Foxe, publicist, Christopher Goodman, prot√©g√© of Peter Martyr, Nicholas Grimald and Alexander Nowell.Crook (2008) pp. 30‚Äì31. Despite producing several Anglican and evangelical sympathisers, the college retained many Catholic sympathisers. Six Brasenose fellows were executed for their loyalty to the pope: John Shert, Thomas Cottam and Laurence Johnson at Tyburn in 1582, and Robert Anderson, Francis Ingleby and George Nichols thereafter, only smaller in number than St. John's.Crook (2008) pp. 32‚Äì35. Next to the Hall, westwards, and on the first floor, was the original chapel, now the Senior Common Room, entered from Staircase I through an ante-chapel, or \\"Outward Chapel\\" as it is called in the list of Room Rents. It had tracery windows both on the north and south sides, the marks of which may still be seen. Those towards the quadrangle have been replaced by sash windows, those to the south are now blocked up.Allfrey (1909). p. 8. From 1604 to 1612, ¬£173 19s. 2d. on chambers over the library, seats in the chapel and other things, part of a system of works.Allfrey (1909). p. 11. Construction The seventeenth century saw a second wave of building at Brasenose, started under the Principalship of Samuel Radcliffe. Under his leadership an attic story was added to Old Quad in the 1630s, and a new chapel and library both constructed between 1656 and 1666.Crook (2008). p. 45.Buchan (1898). p. 81. The work totalled some ¬£4,000, achieved eventually despite Brasenose's previous money problems; in comparison, in 1680 college income was a sustainable ¬£600 a year.Crook (2008). p. 81. =Preliminary= Map of the college in 1900 (shaded) overlaying the approximate boundaries of the halls it expanded into, including Little St. Edmund Hall. Having failed to achieve all his aims during his lifetime, in his will, read 24 April 1648, Radcliffe directs his executors:Allfrey (1909). p. 15. > to sell Piddington within 1 year, give one years profits to the poor of > Rochdale. This should return ¬£1500, of which ¬£1000 to the Chapel, & the > material of the Coll. tenement by the Starre, to make the south side of the > Quadrangle, ¬£600 for a building on pillars betw. Mr. Sixsmiths Chamber & the > Small Hall of Edmund; this will make a walk under cover the great want of > Brasenose. \\"The Coll. tenement by the Starre\\" refers to St. Mary's College, situated to the west of Cornmarket Street, on the site of which Frewin Hall now stands; \\"the Starre\\" is now the site of the Clarendon Centre (once the Clarendon Hotel). The college, accordingly, set to work to carry out the Principal's wishes. The sale of Piddington realized ¬£1,850, two other legacies of ¬£66 13s. 4d. and ¬£15 respectively came in, and a subscription list shows that money continued to be given from time to time up to November 1671, when the total sum subscribed amounted to ¬£4,775 4s. 4d. As well these legacies and subscriptions in cash, the college possessed a very valuable asset in the shape of the old buildings of St. Mary's College, which helped to keep costs down. This property was acquired in 1580 and in 1584 was let with the proviso that any unroofed buildings might be pulled down whenever required. In 1628, two masons and two carpenters viewed the buildings and other accessories which had been erected since it came into the hands of the college, and valued them at ¬£1,480. Whether the college had any designs as to the ultimate fate of the chapel belonging to St. Mary's College before 1649 is unclear, but by this time its destruction was certainly planned, for the site was let to one John Kinge of the Inner Temple, reserving the right to \\"enter in with workmen and labourers, carts and horses, to pull down the old Chapel, and to carry away the materials to build the new Chapel according to the intencion of the last will and testament of Samuel Radcliffe\\". Even if a site for the new buildings had not been prescribed in the will, there would have been no difficulty in finding one.Allfrey (1909). pp. 15-16. The college had rented since 1530 and now finally acquired both Little St. Edmund Hall and the large piece of garden separating it from William Smyth's buildings, a plot well suited for the formation of a small quadrangle, with a \\"covered walk\\" on one side. The chapel could very well take the place of St. Edmund Hall itself, then to be pulled down, and be connected with the rest of the college by the cloister or covered walk, to which the Principal attached so much importance.Allfrey (1909). p. 16. Samuel Radcliffe (d.1651), Principal. Arms: Argent, a bend engrailed sable with a mullet for difference. He failed to start work on the chapel during his lifetime; construction began eight years after his death. Screen, displaying arms of Samuel Radcliffe (similar to the screen in All Souls College, Oxford, showing the arms of Portman) Both money and land, then, being provided, there seemed no reason why the work should not begin at once. Owing to various delays however, caused by disputes over the will, the sale of Piddington, the transfer of the site, and for various other reasons, an actual start was not made until 1656, so that eight years elapsed after the Principal's death before the preliminaries were all finally settled and operations could commence. The interval was employed in collecting timber and other material; when once begun, work went steadily forward without intermission until the chapel was close to complete. Preparations began soon after Principal Radcliffe's death, in 1651, when the selection and felling of timber in Mynchery Wood, the property of the college, was undertaken. The Bursar saw to this himself, and records his expenses: \\"given [that] day when I went to viewe [the] tymber to [the] 2 woodmen for their care 4s. and to [the] 6 workmen to drink 3s.\\" Further items are given for felling and carting, and for sawing up at the college. By 9 July 1651 the last load of timber was drawn in, and all the carters received a \\"dinar and beverage bringing home [the] last timber from [the] woods to [the] college\\". Workmen's compensation is not forgotten: \\"to [the] poore man [that] had his leg broken in plucking down a tree 5s.\\" In addition to all this, ¬£84 was paid to Sir George Stonehouse for timber bought outright from him.Allfrey (1909). pp. 16-17. =Work begins= It was not until 1656 that a real start on the chapel was made, when building operations began in earnest. The historical record of the construction, and the various problems that presented themselves, were recorded in a book entitled \\"The Book of Accounts for the New Buildings, in Brasenose College, in Oxford, begun Anno Dm 1656\\". Discovered in the Victorian era among the college's documents, it was originally the work of the then Bursar, Mr. Houghton, who seems to have had the entire management of the business side of the undertaking in his hands. His powers were formally recognized by the college on 4 November 1657, when it is decreed that Mr. Houghton to have sole charge of \\"finishing the new Chappell, and building a new Library upon a cloyster with buttresses ace. to ye modell and to receive such sumes of money as shall be issued out for that purpose out of the common chest for which he is to give an account to the Society once every month.\\"Allfrey (1909). p. 17. There was no contractor. The Bursar laid out the money thus entrusted to him in the purchase of materials, payment of wages, and so forth, and of all this the book is a complete and detailed record. Amounts paid for scaffold poles, stone, timber if required, tools, and all necessaries and materials for carrying out the work are put down. The names of all the workmen are entered, with their daily and weekly wages, notes are made of the important events during the progress of the works, such as the laying of the foundation stone of the chapel, the commencement of the cloister or library, and so on. Each page is totalled up, and signed by \\"Dan. Greenwood Pr[incipal]\\".Allfrey (1909). pp. 17-18. The practical part, the superintendence of the building operations, and all that now falls to the architect and his clerk of the works, were in the hands of a Mr. John Jackson, the \\"overseer\\" as he is called in the book. Jackson was the overseer of the buildings, receiving wages of 20s. per week, undertaking the work on 24 March 1655. He was seemingly important, responsible for the model for the chapel roof, and he subsequently gave evidence in court as to the cost of the building.Allfrey (1909). p. 18. Preliminaries being settled, pulling down began in earnest, and the first entry in the accounts is for 22 March 1656, when baskets for the slatters, ladders, mattocks, and boards are bought, and 1s. 6d. a day and bevers (i.e. \\"lunch\\") are paid to the men for taking the slates off the old chapel at St. Mary's College. Then comes a very important item: > \\"P[ai]d ye sd Redheads & Quatermen (3 carts) in bringing ye Roofe of ye Old > Chapple to ye Coll: & alsoe ye Scaffoldinge 2 days a piece at 6d. a cart & > 3d. Bevers in all paid ytn 1l. 17s. 6d.\\" The workmen received 3s. extra in all, on account of the dangerous character of the work.Allfrey (1909). pp. 18-19. Subsequently we get an item \\"for building ye sheds for ye Roof of ye Chapple\\". Then comes \\"Rowling ye timber into ye church yard of S. Mary's\\", and by 26 April all the old roof was down. Then follows the pulling down of Little St. Edmund Hall.Allfrey (1909). p. 19. On 24 May the first lot of freestone is brought, and very soon after this the foundations are begun: > \\"Foundacon of ye Chappie was layd on Wednesday ye 18 of June, 1656\\", this > being the first stone, for shortly after comes Mdum yt on Fryday [the] first > of August: 1656 ye foundacon of our Chapple being 20 ft. deep one place with > another, was then fully brought up and finisht.\\" Walling stone, \\"Scapeld Burr\\" at 12d. a load at the pit, lime, and Burford stone, are continually purchased, and from fourteen to twenty labourers at 12d. a day each and bevers, and from six to ten masons at 18d. a day and bevers, are regularly employed. The number of labourers, however, is shortly reduced, as soon as the digging for the foundations is completed. The work must have gone forward at a good pace, for in October the carver gets ¬£1 for carving \\"two lonick capitals\\" in Burford stone, also 7s. for the spandrels, probably those of the North doorway of the ante-chapel. In October ¬£1 13s. 6d. is spent on \\"straw to thatch the chapel\\", and a load of clay is procured \\"to be dawbed upon the thatch\\", as a temporary roof, no doubt. One important item with regards to the design and style of the architecture was \\"[the] window james [jambs] from ye old Chapel\\" which appear in the records at this time. In March 1657, \\"The Little Cloyster begun to be diggd\\", and at digging a foundation for \\"ye little lobby\\" the workmen receive 5s. at several times \\"to make them drink and continue their work longer than ordinary, by reason of ye often colting of ye mould\\", from which it appears that the trenches were in soft ground and had to be got out and filled in quickly. \\"Plancking stone\\" is mentioned, and some boards and poles are bought in London by Jackson, and conveyed by water to Oxford.Allfrey (1909). pp. 19-20. A great deal of stone is used at this time, so the work must have been going on fast. In June 1657 the lead for the side cloister is bought, and in August old iron bars for the windows are worked up. Two cartloads of moss are drawn in for the chapel and some boards come from London by water to \\"ye High Bridge\\" (Hythe Bridge).Allfrey (1909). p. 20. =Approaching completion= By March 1658 when work commenced on the library, the chapel was probably well forward, as evidenced by the purchase of \\"Bottle creasts\\" from Burford, probably the urns over the buttresses. It is, however, difficult to arrive at the rates of progress of the work in any detail, from the fact that an entry in the book of payments for various materials does not necessarily mean that they were built into the work at the date of the entry. The smiths' work and ironwork came from Birmingham to Banbury by water, and thence to Oxford. In December 1657, when the last payment for ironmongery is made, Nathaniel Brokesby, the schoolmaster of Birmingham, who took great pains to secure these materials for the college, received two pairs of gloves with black fingers, and a pair of white \\"kid's leather\\" gloves. The carving seems to have been completed by December 1658, for Symon White (who is evidently a superior workman, receiving 22d. a day, the highest wage paid to anyone, and who was the master carver) is no longer employed. No other carvers are mentioned, and as there is not a great deal of ornament, he may have done all the work himself, with the aid perhaps of his apprentices. Very probably he designed it also, and was, no doubt, trained in the new school of classic design, after the manner of Nicholas Stone, or any of the other carvers of that date, whose work could then be seen on St. Mary's Church porch, or elsewhere. Whether for temperance' sake or for other reasons bevers are now abated, and after this date John Jackson is not paid as overseer.Allfrey (1909). p. 21. The college was now in the midst of the lawsuit with Ralph Reniger, and the Book of Accounts was shown to John Jackson and John Hopkins at their examination before the commissioners. The total amount paid over to Bursar Houghton at this time seems to have been ¬£2,260, made up as follows, according to the entry, but Houghton having disbursed ¬£2,341 0s. 6d. the remainder is stated as still due to him. Illustration from 1675, showing the completed Chapel Some long timbers are bought for the \\"new Roofe of the Chapel\\", and plastering to the roof began on 14 June 1659. The design of the chapel ceiling must have been decided before now, and it would seem to have required considerable elaboration and contrivance, for Jackson, on 5 November 1659, gets ¬£20 \\"for his modell of the Roof of ye new Chapple, & his paynes taken about it, according to the agreement made before the undertaking of it\\". From this it is probably that some entirely new work was added to the old timbering, otherwise an elaborate model, costing ¬£80 or so, would not have been necessary.Allfrey (1909). p. 22. Jackson was also entrusted with monies to pay for certain work done, including \\"the frontispiece over the cloister door being of Burford Stone, with [the] Kings arms on a shield\\" - the door being the one leading out into School Street (now Radcliffe Square). Between the middle of June 1659 and August 1661 there are few entries in the records, indicative of only a little work taking place. By August 1661 the roof had been completed, and was then whitened. The interior of the building, however, had stood in the rough all this time, the ground had now to be levelled up, timber removed, and preparation made for the internal finishings. The panelling does not appear to have been put in till June 1662, when the joiners (who came from London) are paid and forty wainscots added at a cost of ¬£63. Work went on for the rest of the year, ¬£42 was spent on marbles, and the last item in the book is one of ¬£23 for \\"wyre for the east, west, and north Windows\\", probably nettings to protect the glass. At the end of April the book is balanced up, and signed by Thomas Yate, Principal; Radol. Rawson, Vice-Principal and others. The interior of the chapel, however, was not yet completed. A further payment was made to John Wyld, the joiner, of ¬£50 in 1664, also ¬£30 to Simon White, the carver, for marbles, in 1665. In 1666, White gets ¬£52 for laying the marbles, and in the same year there is the account for fittings, cushions, and similar. All these bills were paid by the Bursar, but do not come into the Book of Accounts, and amounted to ¬£81 18s. 11d. Everything must have been practically completed, however, by 1666, for in that year Walter, Lord Bishop of Oxford, performed the solemn act of consecration. History post-completion =Mid-Victorian and before= By the end of 1666, the new chapel and library were complete, fitted up, and in use by the college, and from now onwards very little change in the fabric itself is recorded. Various accessories and fittings have, however, been added by the college, or by various donors from time to time. The first of these was an extremely fine brass eagle, which now stands in the middle of the floor, given by Thomas Lee Dummer of Swatheling, Hants, in 1731. It is commemorated in an inscription on the globe on which the eagle stands, with Dummer's coat of arms and motto. It seems to have taken three days to fix, and stood on a stone slab 9 feet square. It was sent to London in 1734, possibly to be engraved, and on its return some new ironwork was put to the \\"aegle\\", and four men employed to fix it. In 1733 Sir Darcey Levir, of Accrington, Lancashire, gave ¬£50 towards a marble altar piece, of which there is no further record at the time, but which is believed to be the most recent and which was restored in the late Victorian period. In 1748-9 some very elaborate furniture of crimson velvet, crimson damask curtains and a Wilton carpet, were provided for the communion table, costing ¬£140 13s. 4d. in total. At this time the altar was railed off, and the item of \\"painting and gilding the ironwork to the altar rail ¬£12 10s.\\" suggests that the railings were of the elaborate scrollwork which was common at that date, as in All Saints Church, Oxford, or in the iron gates at All Souls College. They were taken down at some time before 1850, and apparently used to form the front of the seats against the north and south walls.Allfrey (1909). p. 29. The two gilt chandeliers, now hanging, were given by William Drake of Shardeloes, in 1749, but for twenty-three years (from 1865 to 1887) were in Coleshill Church. The building had by this time been exposed to the trying atmosphere of Oxford for nearly one hundred years, and consequently sundry external repairs were necessary from time to time to keep the fabric in proper condition. ¬£350 is spent in new slating, timber, and lead, in 1779. Fourteen years later one of the ends is scaffolded, and the vases taken down. Decay seems to have gone on gradually, and in 1817 the east end is reported to be very perishable, having decayed to the depth of 3 or 4 inches from its former surface.Allfrey (1909). p. 30. In 1819 the interior of the chapel was very extensively overhauled and done up, ¬£201 being spent on cleaning and painting the ceiling and walls, and staining and twice varnishing the oak. The capitals of the reredos were re- gilt. A considerable sum was spent on repairs to the roof, and there is a note on the estimates for painting, that the \\"colour is so much injured by damp that it will require in many places to be painted four times over\\". Various repairs to the wainscot were also carried out, so it would seem that the building had suffered considerably from neglect. A bill was sent in at this time for \\"a flight of three oak steps carved at the sides, the top forming a platform, with carved balusters, the arms of the College on each side, the founder's arms in front, with a rich carved foliage ornament of vine leaves and wheat with ribbands\\". This elaborate stage was used for reading essays and declamations from, and was intended for the ante-chapel. It did not give satisfaction, apparently, for there is a note on the account: \\"?Will he take back his flight of steps, cumbersome and disproportionate to the chapel, and without anything to recommend it but the beauty of the carving below.\\" Apparently he would not, as it had been ordered by the college and carried out, for the bill was paid in 1820. At the same time, new hangings and fittings are provided, crimson cloth, a new altar table, with turned and carved legs, a new carpet, cushions, kneelers, and covers costing over ¬£610, so that the interior now must have been in perfect order.Allfrey (1909). pp. 30-31. A sketch of the chapel in around 1835, showing the screen as it was before the addition of the organ near the end of the century The exterior next demanded attention. The original stone used for ordinary facing work is not known, but it seems to have been a very unsatisfactory kind, probably from Headington. By 1841 it was in a very bad state of decay, and Philip Hardwick, the architect, who had contributed a design for the High Street front in his earlier days, was called in to report on the general condition of the chapel and library, as well as the rest of the college.Allfrey (1909). p. 31. His report said:Allfrey (1909). pp. 31-32. > \\"The principal trusses of the roof of the Chapel are sound, of oak, and > moulded. The queen posts have moulded bases, and have the appearance of > having been used in a more ancient building. The roof was once stripped of > stone slates, and new rafters and Welsh slates put. These are lighter, and > thus the weight, which has pressed the walls outwards has been relieved. The > groined ceiling, of wood and plaster, seems sound. Brackets and corbels are > decayed. The walls are much perished, especially the south wall. Part of the > cornice has been removed and wet has got in. The upper part of the wall is > nearly 7 inches out of centre. Pinnacles and battlements are much > perished... The Chapel to be done as soon as possible. The interior decayed > work to be taken out, and the cornice, between the battlements, done in > cement.\\" An estimate was prepared for all this work and amounted, including restoration of part of the old front up to the Tower, to ¬£3,200. It was carried out in sections, with the east end of the chapel and library in 1845. The old tracery of the chapel and library windows, renewed during the restoration, was taken over to Denton House near Cuddesdon, where some alterations were made by a relative of the then Warden of All Souls. It was built into the wall surrounding the garden, the east window being set up entire. The south wall was left till 1848 and the ante-chapel until 1869, when plans were sent for refacing it in stone, and for restoring the pinnacles in Tainton stone, at the cost of ¬£940 16s. This work was then carried out.Allfrey (1909). p. 32. Previously to this, in 1859, a committee had been appointed to report on the internal condition and fittings of the chapel. Whether disrepair or the aversion of the Gothic Revivalists to the old Georgian fittings prompted this movement is not apparent, but Buckler's report would suggest that his leanings are certainly in the direction of reform, though he does not advise any very drastic change. The walls and roof were to be painted the same colour, the panels of the roof painted brilliant blue, the edges of the ribs to be gilded, and the sides coloured vermilion. One bay, over the altar, was to be coloured in this manner, as a trial. The marble screen at the east end was to be re- polished and re-gilded. The altar dais and steps and also the rest of the chapel floor was to be paved with Minton's tiles, using for the latter as much of the black and white marble as remained, and the panelling to be darkened and varnished.Allfrey (1909). pp. 32-33. The Portland stone paving of the ante-chapel was to be renewed, leaving the gravestones, and the platform on which the eagle stood altered.Allfrey (1909). p. 33. The ante-chapel must have been then seated throughout, as it was proposed to remove the seats, leaving only the seat along the wall at the south end. A new altar was also suggested, and new furniture and gas standards. How much of this proposed work was actually carried out is unclear. =Late Victorian and onwards= The present glass in the windows is considered of no great antiquarian or artistic interest; the east window, completed in the nineteenth century, is a possible exception. It was with this in mind that the decoration of the interior and the stained glass in the windows were considered in 1886 in a report on the Wordsworth Memorial. The report suggested that the glass was dark and heavy; that elaborate decoration was of no use owing to the darkness of the building, and more light should be let in. It suggested a wall decoration of arabesques and a new and complete scheme of windows, with figures on a clear ground, like those in Trinity College Chapel. A complete series of windows on one comprehensive scheme in harmony with the architecture and decoration is no doubt what every building wants for its artistic completion, but sentiment is apt to intervene when the removal of the memorials of past worthies is suggested. In 1892-3, a new organ was purchased for the chapel by then- Principal Charles Heberden.Crook (2008). p. 311. Heberden's own personal commitment to the church came despite being Brasenose's first lay Principal. After the possibility of placing it in a recess to be formed in the north wall of the sanctuary had been considered, it was eventually placed over the existing screen. Pillars in the ante-chapel were added to support the organ gallery. Principal Heberden was also largely responsible for the restoration and repair in 1902 of the marble reredos, which had fallen into a bad condition.Allfrey (1909). pp. 33-34. The whole was carefully taken down as far as the surbase and thoroughly overhauled. As much of the old work as it was possible to save was used again, some of the pilasters being rubbed down and repolished. Panels, frames, the columns next the centre, and all defective parts, were replaced with new. The panelling and seats, now stripped of their varnish, are the original work, except that a third row was added in 1884, though an addition to the screen was made when the organ was erected. The ceiling was recoloured in 1895 by Charles Eamer Kempe,Allfrey (1909). p. 34. a move which has been both extensively praised and criticised; one commenter in the 1970s remarked that \\"anything as strange and curious as Arts and Craft aestheticism overlaid on seventeenth-century fake Gothic, which in turn disguises a genuine fifteenth-century hammer-beam roof is certainly worth keeping - if only for the sheer zaniness of it all\\". =Modern= The chapel in 2015 The current organ was originally installed in 1973, although it is still housed in the old late Victorian organ case. It was rebuilt in 2002-3, with additions and re-fittings. The current chapel is open to members of all denominations. The current chaplain is Reverend Dr Dominic Keech, who also serves in a pastoral capacity. The chapel also houses a portrait and a painting of one hand of the Childe of Hale, described in contemporary sources as man of 9 foot 3 inches in height. This recalls a visit to the college on his return from a visit to London in 1617. Design style The chapel, in particular, was a mix of architectural styles ‚Äì Gothic revival and baroque.Crook (2008). p. 79. The chapel is mixture of late Gothic tracery, Renaissance swags of fruit and foliage, cherubs and cusps, fan-vaulting and Corinthian capitals. In the first place there was the old chapel of St. Mary's College, the roof and window jambs of which were used up again in the new building.Allfrey (1909). p. 25. The date of this chapel is not quite certain. It may have been as early as 1440, or even before that date; it was certainly completed by 1536. It would in any case have been in late Perpendicular Gothic, with tracery windows, and had the hammer-beam roof, now over the new chapel. Gothic traditions lingered on in Oxford longer than anywhere else: Trinity College Hall, with its Perpendicular windows was built in 1610; Wadham College also in 1610; Thomas Bodley's additions to the Bodleian Library, and the old Schools, were finished in 1613. At the same time the new school of the Renaissance was emerging, in its later and more classical phase, with its carvers trained in the school of Inigo Jones, Nicholas Stone, and others, who had already done work in Oxford, at St. Mary's porch, the Oxford Botanic Gardens, and elsewhere. At the time of the chapel's construction there were thus competing styles. It is the mixture of styles that has attracted most of the criticism. During the period that Brasenose Chapel was being constructed, the old Gothic or early Renaissance master craftsman, or master builder, was disappearing and the architect, planner and designer was beginning to take his place. The role of the architect, pioneered by Inigo Jones, did not attain his full strength in the United Kingdom until the time of Sir Christopher Wren and his successors. With regards the Brasenose project, there is no appointed architect; instead John Jackson gets ¬£1 a week as an \\"overseer\\". In the absence of an alternative, it is probable that the design is his. On the one he was trained in the new school, but on the other was hampered by the necessity of using up the materials of the old chapel and he had not the authority, if he had the strength of conviction, to throw aside the old manner.Allfrey (1909). pp. 25-26. The plan of the chapel holds to the Gothic tradition of the T form, but the proportions of the interior, the arrangement of bays and buttresses outside, and the carving, are distinctly classical. Perhaps it was difficult owing to the disturbed state of the country to get carvers outside Oxford; in any case he had to use up old material.Allfrey (1909). p. 26. For some reason or other, perhaps because it contains swags and Classic capitals, it has been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren. Certainly he was in Oxford in 1656, not being elected to the Gresham Professorship till 1657, but from then onwards he spent most of his time in London, and probably did not return till his election to the Savilian Professorship in 1661. It is possible that he was interested in the matter, as an amateur: his father had very strong architectural leanings, and may have imbued his son with like interests: but there is absolutely no evidence in support of the theory, nor is there anything to show that he had any interest in architecture before his appointment to the post of Assistant Surveyor General in 1662, when the chapel was practically completed. Beyond details of carving, there is little resemblance to his work, and the building lacks the unity and feeling for proportion and scale which are the chief characteristics of Wren's style. Several works in the Classic manner, attributed to Inigo Jones, or to his carver, Nicholas Stone, had been executed twenty years before in Oxford, and the chapel has much more in common with the Porch of St. Mary's Church than with anything that Wren ever did. One historian, T. G. Jackson, in his book on St. Mary's Church, reviewing the question of the authorship of the Porch, quotes an entry by Wood to the effect that a \\"Mr. Jackson\\" received ¬£22 more than his bargain for the erection of the porch, and suggests that Mr. Jackson was the \\"builder\\". It is therefore possible this was the same designer as Brasenose chapel.Allfrey (1909). p. 27. The ceiling in 2017 The Interior, except for its screen, has more congruity; the tracery of the windows and the Gothic network of the roof bear one another company, and are only disturbed by the proportions of the whole, which have more of Trinity Chapel than is in keeping with the interior of a building in the Perpendicular style. This same roof, or rather ceiling, has given rise to much speculation, and in almost every book on the chapel you find it stated that it came from St. Mary's College, and that it does not fit the building. This, however, is true only in part. The facts appear to be these. The old chapel of St. Mary's College possessed a fine open-timbered hammer-beam roof. When this was pulled down the roof was transported and housed, not in St. Mary's Churchyard, but in the college, under sheds, till the walls were ready to receive it. It was then put up over the new chapel, one of the hammer-beams being secured with irons. The trusses were carefully spaced out to suit the windows and the length of the antechapel, which is so proportioned that it is equal, from east to west, to two bays of the chapel itself, there being a very narrow strip over the organ, with a pair of brackets on either side, instead of one. This is not due to a misfit, but is intentional, otherwise the key of the vault at the centre of the bay would not come opposite the centre of the window. The brackets, which are all that can be seen of the old roof, do not come exactly in the centre of the piers between the windows, possibly because the windows are not opposite one another, or more probably because the old trusses had become distorted in moving. But, for some reason or other, an open-timbered hammer beam roof was not wanted, probably a decision made from the first, since the trusses are spaced to suit the existing vault exactly.Allfrey (1909). pp. 27-28. Jackson was therefore instructed to prepare a model for the new roof, for which he received ¬£20, and he accordingly designed a fan-vaulted ceiling, of wood and plaster, to be put up beneath the old hammer-beam roof, and securely fixed to it.Allfrey (1909). p. 28. And very ingeniously he did it. The points of the hammerbeams gave him the line for his pendents, the great feature of the later fan-vaulted roofs. From these the ribs of the vaulting spring, and between them he shaped his ceiling in the ordinary way, after the manner of that at Windsor, for example. The hammer-beams themselves gave him a springing for short, low pitched tunnel vaults, running north and south, to connect the wall above the window heads with the rest of his vaulting. These are stepped, so to speak, and in two levels. If he had run his tunnel vault through at one level, the crown of it would have run out high above the head of the windows, and necessitated a gable over each window. The hammer-beams and the brackets below them are left to show below the new vault, and are ingeniously worked into the design. All the rest of the old roof is up above, and out of sight. The effect of the whole is successful, and not out of keeping with the windows. A glance at the photograph of the interior will explain the arrangement, which is very difficult to make clear with words only. The design is almost identical with that of the stone vault over the Choir of the Cathedral, the great stone bracket pieces there taking the place of the hammer-beam supports, while the tunnel vaults run through at one level. This ceiling was done at the time the new chapel was built. It would not have been possible to remove a wood and plaster ceiling entire, or even in pieces, and re-erect it, and there would have been no need for an expensive model if the old vaulting had been in the college, ready to put up again. Also, the entry of 18 June 1659, \\"began to plaster the Chapel roof\\" which, doubtless, refers to the panels of plaster between the wood ribs. It may be objected that this is very late for a fan- vaulted roof, and so it would be anywhere but in Oxford.Allfrey (1909). pp. 28-29. The fan-vaulting in St. Mary's Porch was done in 1637, and the great fan-vaulted staircase at Christ Church was not done until 1640. So there is no reason at all why it should not have seemed quite the natural thing to cover even a partially Renaissance building in this manner, especially one with so much Gothic feeling about its windows.

Early life and education Vivion Brewer was born Vivion Lenon to Warren and Clara (Mercer) Lenon, in Little Rock on October 6, 1900. She graduated from what is now Little Rock Central High School in 1917, and attended Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, graduating in 1921 with a major in sociology. In 1926, she enrolled in the Arkansas Law School in Little Rock while working for her father‚Äôs bank in Little Rock. She graduated in 1928. Desegregation Work During the Little Rock Crisis in 1957, Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out the Arkansas National Guard to prevent nine African-American students from entering Central High School. In the fall of 1958, Little Rock‚Äôs citizens voted to close the city‚Äôs high schools rather than desegregate all of the city‚Äôs schools. Brewer joined with Adolphine Fletcher Terry to organize the WEC in September 1958. Brewer initially suggested working with African- American women to help better understand race relations in the city, but the WEC members decided that they needed to focus solely on reopening the schools in order to deflect segregationist criticism. Brewer took the lead in dealing with the media for the WEC and, because of her highly visible position in the WEC, quickly became the target of segregationists, often receiving threatening and offensive telephone calls and mail. In her memoir, she recalled some reluctance serving as the WEC‚Äôs chairperson on account of the fact that she did not reside in Little Rock and her only child had not lived to school age. The schools reopened in the fall of 1959, and Brewer resigned as chairperson of the WEC in 1960. Later Life and Death Smith College awarded Brewer an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 1961 for her work during the school crisis. She died on June 18, 1991, in Sierra Madre, California, where she lived for the last three years of her life. She is buried in Roselawn Memorial Park in Little Rock. Personal Life In 1930, she married Joseph Brewer, nephew of Arkansas Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson, and moved to Washington D.C. with her husband, where he held positions in the federal government; she also acted as a secretary to his uncle for a time.

She was a member of the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives and of the Alaska State Senate. She was instrumental in the creation of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which helped insure state revenue from oil and gas exploration done by outside entities. Ryan was involved with the creation of the Anchorage International Airport. She was the first female pilot to solo in the Territory of Alaska, and the first woman to earn a geology degree from New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. She was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2011. Background and early life Irene Esther Irvine was born in Boston, Massachusetts on September 10, 1909. Her parents were Leonard Laukki Irvine and Esther Neiminen Irvine. While working in Texas, she heard stories about Alaska from an aviator uncle based in the territory. Aged 22, she relocated to Anchorage. She began flying lessons at Merrill Field east of Anchorage. On June 23, 1932, she was certified as the first female aviator in the territory to solo. She briefly left Alaska to study at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in geology, the first woman to do so at that institution. On February 19, 1938, she married fellow student John Edward \\"Pat\\" Ryan. In February 1941, she gave birth to their first child Marcella. A month later, the couple relocated back to Alaska, where the couple's other daughter Patricia was born. Career Her civilian career was largely as a consultant to Alaskan industries tied to her field of expertise. She was involved with development of the oil and gas exploration in the state, and the Skagway to Fairbanks pipeline. Ryan was responsible for the design of seventeen airports in Alaska, including Anchorage International Airport. In 1952 she invested her money in a housing project in Anchorage. In 1955, Ryan was elected to the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives. In 1959, she became a member of the Alaska State Senate. It was during her years in the legislature when Ryan used her educational and professional background to benefit the welfare of her state. She used her influence to get the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission created in 1955, insuring the state's revenues from oil and gas exploration by outside entities.

It is the area where the relics of St. Peter were venerated in early medieval times, before his skull was removed to be housed at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. Open today for pilgrims, the site venerates the original pavonazzo marble monument placed there by Emperor Constantine, and was used in early medieval times to house the skull of St. Peter History Before the Clementine chapel was constructed, the skull of St. Peter was housed in its original resting place in the graffiti wall below the large tomb-like structure commissioned by emperor Constantine. The structure is visible behind the altar of the chapel. The Clementine chapel was constructed by the order of Pope Gregory, due to the original Constantinian monument not having a high altar, thus a new structure was constructed around the Constantinian monument, and a more traditional high altar was constructed above it in order to celebrate Divine Liturgy, and the clementine chapel was constructed at the back to be used as a place for the veneration of the skull of St. Peter. The chapel is named in honor of Pope Clement VIII, who used the chapel as his burial place and donated funds to install various religious mosaics that have been preserved to this day. It is one of the two main untouched areas of Old St. Peter's Basilica, along with the chapel of the Niche of the Pallia. A notable feature of the chapel are the ornate bronze sculptures located in the chapel commemorating certain biblical scenes, along with its gilded cage in the central altar. According to a direct tour and interview granted to History Channel by the Archpriest of the Basilica, Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the chapel is the holiest site in the archaeological basilica. The chapel itself is directly behind the present niche which is above the relics of St. Peter, thereby the site correlates to the present high altar of St. Peter's Basilica today. The place where the recently discovered Bones of St. Peter are presently housed is not in the niche of the pallia, nor the clementine chapel but in their original resting place in the graffiti wall. The skull of St. Peter which was first venerated in the clementine chapel, (after being moved there by pope Gregory during its construction), is now housed in the golden reliquary above the high altar of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, after being moved there in late medieval times.

It served as a major defensive fortification and checkpoint. It is located at the western end of Neuhauser Stra√üe, a portion of Munich's down-town pedestrian zone, which was part of the salt road and the east-west thoroughfare of the historic old town. Thus it separates the historic centre from a 19th-century extension called Ludwigvorstadt (Vorstadt meaning 'suburb'). Karlstor receives its name from Karlsplatz (better known under its local nickname \\"Stachus\\"), which is now part of the Altstadtring circular road and has been one of the busiest points of Munich for centuries. The building is the westernmost of three remaining gothic town gates out of originally five. The other two are Isartor in the east (the only one that is still complete in its basic structure) and Sendlinger Tor in the south-west. Missing nowadays, after the whole fortification system had to be laid down on prince-electoral order at the turn from the 18th to the 19th century, are Angertor in the south and Schwabinger Tor in the north, as well as all \\"minor\\" or side gates and the entire double walls. Architecture Between 1285 and 1347 the existing first town walls were supplemented with a new, second, double-ring fortification for and around fast-growing Munich, significantly extending the populated and protected area. The gate must have been created during an early stage of that building process, because it was mentioned in documents in 1302 for the first time already. Back then it was named Neuhauser Tor after the very next village to be reached when having left town. Over time it was extended and fastened. Munich's main gates could only be reached as follows: Via an open wooden runway visitors first had to cross a side arm of the moat surrounding a barbican, semi-circle shaped in the Karlstor's case, that had to be entered through one narrow orifice near one of its corners and with its courtyard forming an outer, wider bailey. Then, passing the outlet at the barbicans backside, they would enter an open stone bridge that crossed a wide moat. The eventual main gates that would be reached at the end of the respective bridges all had a ground plot either rectangular or triangular, with two sturdy, lower front towers looking towards the bridge and barbican on the outside, the passage being in the center of the front wall, and a strong, taller main gate tower on the inside, oriented towards the town. Those respective three towers were interconnected with walls, thus creating another, small, inner bailey. The whole concept created narrow, winding paths following the given, special architectural conditions that improved defensive and checkpoint functions and gave the guards overall control over who and what was to leave or enter the town. Beginning in the 16th century, the structures of the first, inner town wall were gradually removed, except form the five old gate towers. During the Thirty Years War, when the prince-elector ordered a new system of fortifications meeting the necessities of baroque time's, modern artillery warfare to be laid around the town, the second double-ring's old walls and gates remained, but all structures outside, like the forementioned barbican, were either integrated or laid down and substituted by new bastions. Count Rumford, then commander of the Bavarian army under Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, ordered to alter the edge towers in 1791. That same year, Neuhauser Tor was renamed Karlstor after the Elector. In 1857 the gunpowder stocks that were stored in an inbound annex to the main tower exploded and damaged annex and main tower so much that soon after both had to be demolished. The two remaining flanking towers were redesigned and later connected with a new bridge (Gothic Revival). In 1861/62 Arnold Zenetti redesigned the Karlstor to the Neo-Gothic style. It was later integrated in the roundel buildings on both sides next to the gate (constructed by Gabriel von Seidl 1899‚Äì1902). What visitors see nowadays, is these two outside- oriented side towers and its connecting arch, with only little resemblance of the late medieval originals. The eventual old gates used to be a lot narrower and even lower than what is on display now: To reach the necessary improvements in the accessibility of a fast-growing metropolis of the industrial ages, above all considering exploding private traffic and increasing modern public transport (coaches, horse drawn and electrical tramways!), from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries gate tower passages were gradually extended ‚Äì both in width and height ‚Äì and sometimes even side walls had to be broken through. When ‚Äì prior to the 1972 Summer Olympics and in connection with the erection of the central pedestrian zone as well as the implementation of a newly designed system of public transport ‚Äì the underground shopping centre Stachus-Einkaufszentrum was constructed in 1970, an escape tunnel with brick masonry was found, which soldiers and perhaps even civilians could use to escape or enter the town and to get behind enemy lines.

The picture of Caradog Roberts (as above) is on the reverse of this postcard. Rachie, frequently sung to the hymn I Bob Un Sydd Ffyddlon, is a Welsh hymn tune.

Composer  The composer of the hymn tune was Dr Caradog RobertsCaradog Roberts: https://biography.wales/article/s-ROBE- CAR-1878 (born in Rhosllannerchrugog, near Wrexham; 1878-1935) and the tune was named after Rachel Williams (married name Rachel Jenkins) of Resolven, near Neath. \\"Rachie\\" was composed in the first world war, and Roberts says that \\"The committee of the Resolven Music Festival requested me to write a new tune for the festival. I went at it straight away and wrote two tunes the same morning. I rejected tune No.1 and sent No.2. The following year the same committee sent me a similar request for a new tune and said how much they had enjoyed the tune I had sent them the previous year... I was extremely busy then and had no time to compose, so I looked up some old mss. [manuscripts] of mine and found \\"Rachie\\", the tune I had rejected the previous year. I sent it simply to oblige the friends at Resolven. \\"Rachie\\", notwithstanding the fact that it had been turned down by me, turned out to be the most popular of my tunes. It is named after the daughter - then a child - of the pastor of the Congregational Church at Resolven and is pronounced ‚ÄòRay-chee‚Äô, which is short for ‚ÄòRachel‚Äô.\\"  Name  The name of the tune derives from a visit in 1918 by Caradog Roberts to the Jerusalem ChapelJerusalem Chapel, Resolven: http://eclecs.blogspot.co.uk/2006/07/jerusalem-chapel-1875-1999.html in Resolven. This visit was to conduct a Cymanfa Ganu (a Welsh hymn singing festival) in a large chapel that seated 970 people. Caradog Roberts stayed with the minister of the chapel for that event. The minister of the Jerusalem chapel was Parchedig (Rev) Robert Enoch Williams (often known as Rev. R.E. Williams), and minister of that chapel from 1902 to 1934. His daughter was popularly known as Rachie, although christened Rachel. (\\"Rachie\\" was pronounced by the family as \\"Ray-chee\\" and not as \\"Ratch-ee\\" which sometimes now occurs). Dr Caradog Roberts introduced his new tune to the Cymanfa Ganu in Jerusalem Chapel (7 April 1918). Subsequently, he wrote to the Rev R.E. Williams and asked if he could name the tune after the minister‚Äôs 12-year-old daughter Rachie. Her father agreed. However, this new tune had a surprising origin. Dr Caradog Roberts wrote the above honest account about his hymn tune \\"Rachie\\" taken from a booklet of cuttings kept by Rachel Jenkins (Rachie) and now owned by her family.This derives from two interviews with Menna Leyson, the niece of Rachel Jenkins (n√©e Williams), by Professor Colin Baker on 22 April and 20 May 2013. During the interviews, Menna Leyson shared the correspondence that Rachel Jenkins had bequeathed her, including Rachel's notebook containing paper clippings regarding the tune. Menna Leyshon gave permission in that interview for the three pictures above to be made publicly available. Menna Leyson is the current owner of Rachel Jenkins' archives. Menna also became a professional accompanist of the highest repute, not least to Rachie.Further evidence of the origins of the hymn tune derives from a church service in 1982 when a major contributor to this article was present. In 1982, when Professor Colin Baker was an organist at St James' Church in Upper Bangor (Gwynedd, North Wales), Rachie, in person, came to a service, along with her sister-in-law (Morwen) and her niece, Menna Leyshon. The vicar, Rev E.T. Roberts, announced the hymn Who is on the Lord's side? and that the tune would be \\"Rachie\\". He then explained to the congregation that this would be a special moment as Rachie was present in the congregation, along with her sister-in-law and Menna Leyson (who herself was an organist of that church and a much loved accompanist in Wales).  Publication and usage  \\"Rachie\\" was first published in 1921 in a Welsh Independents (Congregationalist) hymn book (Y Caniedydd Cynulleidfaol Newydd), which was co-edited by Roberts. The words sung in Welsh to \\"Rachie\\" are typically I Bob Un Sydd Ffyddlon,Hymn words: Bob Un Sydd Ffyddlon is Morrison Orpheus Choir singing \\"Rachie\\" and the accompanying text contains, in full, the Welsh words of I Bob un sydd ffyddlon and an English language translation. and were written by Henry Lloyd (1870-1946), who is better known by his bardic name Ap Hefin.Henry Lloyd (bardic name: Ap Hefin) : https://biography.wales/article/s2-LLOY-HEN-1870 The lyrics are a call to battle, this can also be seen in the English translation. The words express a similar call to arms as does the hymn \\"Onward, Christian Soldiers\\". In 1931, the Salvation Army published the tune \\"Rachie\\" being sung to the words: \\"Hark! the sounds of singing, coming on the breeze. Notes of triumph winging, over lands and seas\\"Hark the Sounds of Singing: http://www.hymnlyrics.org/lyricsh/hark_the_sounds_of_singing.html (Charles Collier, 1915).http://www.heilsarmeemuseum- basel.ch/E/salvation_army_records.php has some further details about the first Salvation Army recording of \\"Rachie\\" and a short excerpt from the 78rpm record. The tune was published in The Salvation Army Tune Book for Congregational Singing. Later, the tune became the perfect accompaniment for the words of the hymn \\"Who is on the Lord's side?\\".\\"Hymn words: Who is on the Lord's side?\\": http://www.hymnlyrics.org/newlyrics_w/who_is_on_the_lords_side.php This pairing was popularised in various hymn books from the 1960s onwards (e.g. Baptist Hymn Book, 1962; Hymns of Faith, 1964), sometimes transposed to the key of G major rather than the original A flat major. The first recording of the tune \\"Rachie\\" appears to be on 23 June 1934 by the Salvation Army, recorded at a large Territorial Congress Salvation Army event at the Crystal Palace. The old 78rpm recording was one of the first to be made by a mobile recording van; previously all recordings being made in a studio. The 78rpm disc went on sale just three months later. This first recording of \\"Rachie\\" started with the then General of the Salvation Army, General Edward Wiggins, who introduced the hymn, followed by a musical introduction from the united bands. The single microphone is suddenly moved around‚Äìfirst to record General Wiggins singing, then a soprano cornet, followed by the congregation singing. The well-known male voice choir version of \\"Rachie\\" to the words I Bob Un Sydd Ffyddlon is an arrangement by Alwyn Humphreys (published by Curiad in North Wales in 1996) and has popularised an extra ending to \\"Rachie\\". This arrangement finishes with Haleliwia, Haleliwia, Moliant iddo byth, Amen (roughly translated as \\"Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Praise to him forever, Amen\\") that musically derives from the finale of the Welsh hymn tune: Mawlgan (J.H.

Note: The opening chord of the tune \\"Rachie\\" does not follow the standard harmonisation of hymn tunes. Wyn Thomas, Senior Lecturer in Music at Bangor University, Wales (UK), comments as follows: \\"This tune is exceptional amongst Welsh hymn tunes, in that it begins with a tonic chord in its first inversion (i.e. a Ib chord or a I 6/3 chord). This is unheard of in the Welsh hymn tune repertoire because all other hymn tune composers establish the fundamental tonic (root-position) chord (i.e. chord Ia or I 5/3 chord) at the outset, with the tonic note in the bass part. Though Dr Caradog Roberts opens \\"Rachie\\" with a tonic chord, the 3rd of the chord appears in the bass part. This chordal arrangement gives rise to tonal ambiguity and can cause difficulty during unaccompanied performances.\\"Correspondence between Wyn Thomas and Colin Baker, 18 and 21 May 2013.

Picturesque Views of Seats of Noblemen & Gentlemen of Great Britain & Ireland, London, 1880 The ivy-covered ruins of Stevenstone House in 2012. Hoskins described it in 1954 as \\"A villainously ugly house whose present dereliction need bring no tears\\",Hoskins, p.278 and \\"An ugly ruin in a naked and devastated park\\".Hoskins, p.296 To the left is the Palladian Library Room and behind it the Orangery, built c. 1715-30 Stevenstone is a former manor within the parish of St Giles in the Wood, near Great Torrington, North Devon. It was the chief seat of the Rolle family, one of the most influential and wealthy of Devon families, from c. 1524 until 1907. The Rolle estates as disclosed by the Return of Owners of Land, 1873 (corrected by Bateman, 1883) comprised 55,592 acres producing an annual gross income of ¬£47,170, and formed the largest estate in Devon, followed by the Duke of Bedford's estate centred on Tavistock comprising 22,607 with an annual gross value of nearly ¬£46,000.Hoskins, p.88. 3rd was the Earl of Devon with 20,589 acres worth ¬£31,000, 4th was the Fortescue family of Castle Hill with 20,171 acres, worth over ¬£17,000 p/a, 5th was the Duchy of Cornwall with 48,457 acres, much of it moorland, with an annual value of under ¬£5,000 From the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Reform Act of 1832 the county parliamentary representatives were chosen effectively from only ten great families, mostly territorial magnates. The three most dominant of these were the Bampfyldes of Poltimore House and North Molton, the Courtenays of Powderham Castle, and the Rolles of Stevenstone and Bicton.Hoskins, p.183 The Rolles were not from the mediaeval aristocracy as were the Courtenays, but were descended from an able lawyer and administrator of the Tudor era, as were the Russells, later Earls and Dukes of Bedford. Both Russells and Rolles acquired much former monastic land in Devon following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Indeed, the Rolles were in the opinion of Hoskins (1954) \\"second only to the Russells in the extent of their monastic and other lands and in time were to surpass them\\".Hoskins, p.84 In 1669 Sir John Rolle (died 1706), KB of Stevenstone had an annual income of ¬£6,000 making him \\"one of the richest gentlemen in the country\\".Quoted from \\"Tour of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1669\\", quoted in Hoskins, p.86 He died in 1706 seized of more than 40 manors in Devon.Hoskins, p.87, Quoting Lysons, Magna Britannia, 82,b The family built several different houses on the same site known as Stevenstone House, the last Victorian version of which was built between 1868 and 1872. It was significantly reduced in size soon after 1912 and then after 1931 it was gradually demolished piecemeal for building materials. Descent of the manor Arms of Stefenston as given by Tristram Risdon in his \\"Notebook\\" (c. 1630): Sable, a chevron between three dexter hands clenched couped at the wrist in each a purse (should be flintstone or stone) argent. Risdon was uncertain of the charge and placed a question mark against the word \\"purse\\". These appear to be canting arms, the act of a grasping hand suggests possession and if the owner of the hand be given the name \\"Steven\\" this suggests \\"Steven's stone\\". If the spirit of rebuses be followed, the higher the absurdity of the device the more acceptable. George Rolle (died 1552), the 16th-century purchaser of the estate, adopted this charge as his crest, extended to a cubit arm vested, as can be seen on the Library Room at Stevenstone built by John Rolle Walter (died 1779). John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1842) changed the stone into a canting roll of parchment, as is shown in the stained glass window on the grand staircase at Bicton House, and the monument of Samuel Rolle (1669‚Äì1735) of Hudscott in Chittlehampton Church shows a baton. The badge of the hunt class destroyer HMS Stevenstone named after the Rolle family's fox-hunt substituted in the hand a hunting horn John Prince in his \\"Worthies of Devon\\" gives the descent of Stevenstone as follows, based on the work of the Devon topographer Tristram Risdon, himself born within the parish of St Giles, at Winscott House. The earliest recorded holder of the manor was Michael de Stephans, who granted it to Richard Basset, the father of Elias Basset, who granted it to Walter de la Lay, or Ley. His descendant John de Lay changed his name to John de Stephenston. The overlord who was then a later Elias Basset, lord of the manor of Beaupier in Wales, released all his interest in Stevenstone to John de Stevenstone. He was followed by another John, Walter and John de Stephenston. The latter left a daughter Elizabeth de Stephenston his sole heiress, who brought the manor by marriage to her husband Grant of Westlegh, near Bideford. Grant was himself also lacking in male progeny and left two daughters joint heiresses, one of whom married Monk of Potheridge, whilst the other married a member of the Moyle family, who received Stevenstone as his wife's share of the inheritance. He made it his chief residence, and Prince suggests, on the basis of Tristram Risdon's assertion, that his descendant Sir Walter Moyle, a Justice of the King's Bench in 1454, was born here. =Rolle= lion rampant of the first three bezants Various forms of the Rolle crest, the standard form of which is: A cubit arm erect vested or charged with a fess indented double cotised azure in the hand a flint-stone proper.

One of his most prominent clients was Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle (died 1542), whom he served as legal counsel until the latter's death. He served as MP for Barnstaple in 1542 and again in 1545. The male descendants up to 1842 of George Rolle included about twenty Members of Parliament. In 1842 died the last of the male line, John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (1750-1842), descended from George Rolle's second son George Rolle (died 1573) of the manor of Marrais in the parish of Week St Mary in Cornwall, which manor had been procured for him by his father who had obtained the wardship of Margaret of Marrais and bequeathed the same in his will to his son George, who became her husband. The descendants of George Rolle the patriarch's eldest son John Rolle (died 1570) failed in the male line in 1642 on the death of the infant John Rolle (1638-1642). Stevenstone and several other manors which had by then been accumulated by purchase and inheritance from heiresses, passed eventually to Sir John Rolle (1626-1706), the grandson of George Rolle (died 1573) of Marrais. Some of the estates of the patriarch's fourth son Henry Rolle of Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe, also reverted to the line of George Rolle of Marais on the failure in the male line in 1747 on the death of Samuel Rolle of Hudscott, Chittlehampton.

The ivy- covered ruins of Stevenstone House are visible in the background =Trefusis, Baron Clinton= Following the death of Mark Rolle in 1907, the Rolle estates, extending to about 55,000 acres, which had been held by him as life tenant under the will of his aunt's husband John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (1750-1842), descended to his heir male his nephew Charles John Robert Hepburn-Stuart- Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton (1863‚Äì1957), of Huish =Clemson= Lord Clinton sold Stevenstone by auction in 1912 to Captain John Oliver Clemson (1882-1915) and his wife Mary McKinnon, a wealthy heiress.Lauder, pp.10‚Äì11 Clemson was born 30 May 1882 in Crumpsall, Manchester the elder son of John Henry Clemson (1856-1889) of Parkside, Altrincham, Cheshire by his wife Sara Jane Oliver (b. 1855). He had one brother and four sisters. In 1891 aged 8 he was living with his widowed mother at Brookfield House, Bury Old Road, Broughton, Salford. He attended Windermere College Preparatory School, in the parish of St Mary's Church Applethwaite, Windermere, in which church his name appears on a memorial tablet \\"Boys of the Old College who fell in the Great War\\". He later attended Sedbergh School between 1897 and July 1900. In the 1901 census he was residing at Red House, Windermere, as a boarder in a preparatory school with three other pupils. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1901. He described himself in about 1909 as a \\"Gentleman farmer of Peagham (Barton), Torrington\\", which was one of the farms of the Stevenstone estate, about 3/4 mile north of Stevenstone House. On 10 July 1909 he applied for a commission in the Royal North Devon Hussars, and was commissioned as Second Lieutenant on 17 July 1909. In 1911, unmarried and aged 28, he was staying at Bydown House, Swimbridge, near Barnstaple, as a guest of Robert Jameson and his wife Margaret (n√©e McKinnon), who was the brother-in-law of Mary McKinnon, also then residing in the house, aged 28 and born in Calcutta, Clemson's future wife. Includes information from the 1911 census. In 1912 at Paddington, London, he married Mary McKinnon, 3rd daughter of the late John McKinnon of 10 Hyde Park Gardens, London. They had one daughter. The new owners demolished about half of the east front of the house including the main tower and one corner tower, to make it more manageable, presumably due to the war-time lack of domestic staff. He was Master of the Stevenstone Foxhounds. Captain Clemson was mobilised on 4 August 1914 and sailed for Gallipoli on 24 September 1914, as part of the South Western Mounted Brigade, during which campaign he died from wounds on 9 December 1915. He is remembered by a monument in St Giles' Church inscribed as follows: \\"In Loving Memory of John Oliver Clemson, of Stevenstone, Captain Royal North Devon Hussars, who was killed in action in Gallipoli 9th December 1915, aged 33. A great and glorious thing it is to die for one's country\\". He is recorded on the Exeter College, Oxford Roll of Honour, and also on the Altrincham & District Roll of Honour. His widow Mary erected a bronze memorial tablet in the church naming the twelve men of the parish who had lost their lives in World War I, reported on in the local press thus: \\"Following the unveiling by Mrs. Clemson, and the dedication by the Vicar (Rev. C. Walker), the \\"Last Post\\" and Reveille were sounded on cornets, and the effect was grand in its solemnity. Special hymns and psalms were sung by the choir, and the Vicar based his address on the significance of the memorial\\". His grave is in the Lala Baba Cemetery in Turkey. Mrs Clemson remarried to Col. B.C. James, 8th Devon Regiment, awarded the DSO on 1 January 1917, and remained at Stevenstone. =Piecemeal disposal= On 26 September 1930 the estate of Stevenstone was offered for sale by auction, including 665 acres. The property was auctioned again in May 1931, but with only 17 acres and was then described as comprising four reception rooms, 27 bed and dressing rooms and eight bathrooms.Western Times, 29 May 1931, quoted in Lauder, pp.12-13 It failed to sell at ¬£3,000. A further 300 acres were sold separately. In the summer of 1931 the house and some of the parkland was purchased by Mr George Millman, the tenant of Winscott Barton (the ancient home of Tristram Risdon), by then part of the Stevenstone estate, within the parish of St Giles.The Millman family purchased the freehold of Winscott at the dispersal sale of the Rolle Estate He immediately offered it for sale as building materials prior to complete demolition, split into 609 lots. Lot 609 was the residual shell of the house itself after all else had been sold in the previous lots. Mr Millman however changed his intention against selling, but by then the auction could not be stopped. He bought-in as many lots as he could, and the house continued for a few more years, reduced in size again by the demolition of the servants' wing which connected the house to the stable block. The house was still habitable during World War II as troops were stationed there, namely the Warwickshire Regiment and later American troops. After the war Mr Millman finally sold the house to Mr Melville, who contrary to his stated intention at the time of purchase, proceeded to demolish it. He used much of the stone to convert the stable block into terraced housing and built several smaller houses and bungalows around it and in the former walled kitchen garden. In 1970 the vestigial ruins of Stevenstone House were purchased by Mr Parnell, who had purchased the Deer Park in the 1931 sale and had built a bungalow next to the ruins. Although the adjacent detached Library Room and the Orangery were granted Grade II* Listing on 4 October 1960, the ruins of Stevenstone House received much later on 16 February 1989 a Grade II Listing, offering them protection from demolition, but they have continued to deteriorate from adverse weather and are as at 2012 totally covered in ivy. Stevenstone today Around the ruined house exists in 2012 a hamlet of settlement, comprising the terraced houses of the former stable block, several bungalows within the walled kitchen garden, other new houses and the Torrington Farmers Hunt Kennels, previously the Stevenstone Hunt in the days of Mark Rolle. The Palladian outbuildings of the Library Room and the Orangery were purchased in July 1978 by the Landmark Trust and were restored and converted into revenue-producing rental accommodation.

In 2008, Koschischek reached the semifinals of the freestyle and butterfly (both 100 m) at the European Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands, with respective times of 56.15 and 59.61. Having cleared FINA B-cuts in both events, she guaranteed a spot on the Austrian swimming team for the Olympics. Koschischek represented Austria at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where she qualified for two swimming events. On the first night of the Games, Koschischek won the third heat of the 100 m butterfly, by 0.28 of a second ahead of Hong Kong's Hannah Wilson in an Austrian record of 59.07, but she missed out the semifinals by 0.58-second deficit, as she placed twenty-sixth out of 69 swimmers in the preliminaries.

It formed at temperatures of by the hydrothermal alteration of sedimentary and metamorphic manganese ores. Crystallization occurred in fault planes and lenticular bodies in the ore bed or by filling veins and vugs. Manganvesuvianite has been found in association with calcite, manganese-poor grossular, hydrogrossular-henritermierite, mozartite, serandite-pectolite, strontiopiemontite-tweddillite, and xonotlite.Armbruster 2002, pp. 139‚Äì40. Manganvesuvianite is a member of the vesuvianite group and is the manganese analogue of vesuvianite. History In 1883, Arnold von Lasaulx made the first detailed description of vesuvianite containing up to 3.2 wt% MnO from Lower Silesia in Poland.Armbruster 2000, p. 571. Studies in the 1980s and 1990s revealed that the vesuvianite group was more complex than previously assumed, necessitating the definition of new minerals. In 2000, vesuvianite was found containing up to 14.3 wt% MnO from the Kalahari manganese fields of Northern Cape Province, South Africa.Armbruster 2000, p. 570. Manganvesuvianite proper was discovered in the Wessels () and N'Chwaning (shaft II; ) mines of the Kalahari manganese fields and described in 2002 in the journal Mineralogical Magazine. It was named manganvesuvianite for the significant manganese in its formula and its relation to vesuvianite.

Also known as the Gibraltar \\"A\\" Head Lighthouse, it has a cast- iron, skeletal tower which is painted black and features two galleries. The lighthouse remains operational and is positioned west of the Rock of Gibraltar, on the South Mole at Gibraltar Harbour. It is operated by the Gibraltar Port Authority. History Gibraltar Harbour (pictured on map), also referred to as the Port of Gibraltar, is on the west side of the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, at latitude 36¬∫09'N, and longitude 5¬∫20'W. In addition to the protection provided to the port by the Rock of Gibraltar on the east, there is a system of manmade defences on the west. These include a trio of breakwaters: the North Mole (formerly the Commercial Mole) including its Western Arm, the Detached Mole, and the South Mole. The South Mole includes an extension which was added later, and was formerly known as the New Mole and New Mole Extension. The harbour has both north and south entrances. The northern entry is bordered by the Western Arm of the North Mole and the (middle) Detached Mole. The southern entry is between the Detached Mole and the South Mole. The Gibraltar South Mole Lighthouse (shown on map) is located at the north end of the South Mole of Gibraltar Harbour. It is positioned at the \\"A\\" head of the South Mole (formerly specified as the extension), from which it derives its alternate name. The lighthouse and port are to the north of the east end of the Strait of Gibraltar, the entryway to the Mediterranean Sea, and west of the Rock of Gibraltar. The South Mole Lighthouse comprises a black, octagonal tower built of cast iron, with a height of . This description correlates with the photograph from The Online List of Lights. The skeletal tower has a central cylinder and has retained its original gallery. The lamp was exchanged for a square skeletal tower and new lantern, with a second gallery platform, to elevate the plane of the light. (A similar tower at the south end of the Western Arm of the North Mole of the port differs in that it lacks the original gallery platform.) Publication 113 gives a different physical description of the lighthouse as a round, white tower, 56 feet in height. The Gibraltar \\"A\\" Head Lighthouse continues to be active and is utilised as an aid to navigation, in and near the harbour. Its light characteristic is a flashing white light, with one flash every two seconds, and the range is fifteen nautical miles. The operational lighthouse has a focal plane of 18 metres (60 feet). The lighthouse tower and the site are both closed to the public. The South Mole Lighthouse is operated by the Gibraltar Port Authority. The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office Admiralty number for the lighthouse, which originates from Volume D of the Admiralty List of Lights and Fog Signals, is D 2442. The United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) number is 4224. Its Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society (ARLHS) number is GIB-002, and the lighthouse has been listed in the World List of Lights since 2006.

During World War II, he served as the Vice President of the Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia. Early life D≈æafer Kulenoviƒá was born to a Bosniak family in the village Kulen Vakuf near Bihaƒá, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary. He was the son of Muhamed-beg Kulenoviƒá and his wife Meleƒáa. He had an older brother, Osman (1889‚Äì1947), a politician and lawyer. Kulenoviƒá attended gymnasium in Sarajevo and Tuzla, and he was expelled from school in 1905 just two months before graduation due to a clash with Serbian students; because of that he transferred to school in Mostar and graduated there in 1909. In the same year, he entered the University of Vienna, but because of health issues he went to Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb from which he graduated. Kulenoviƒá was active in Vienna's Party of Rights' youth organization of pro-Croat Muslims, Svijest (The Awareness), and was elected its president. Kingdom of Yugoslavia In 1919, after the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established, Kulenoviƒá joined the Yugoslav Muslim Organization, a political party of Bosnian Muslims. For every election held in Yugoslavia, he was elected to the National Assembly as a representative of the Brƒçko municipality. When the Vidovdan Constitution was voted on, his party ordered its members in the National Assembly to support the new constitution; however, Kulenoviƒá boycotted the voting as he was against the Constitution and thus didn't violate his party's orders. In 1921, he protested to the Assembly the massacre of 200 Muslims carried out by Serbs in northern Montenegro. When his party divided into the Centralist (pro-Serb) and the pro-Autonomy list, Kulenoviƒá supported the pro-Autonomy. In the 1923 election, the Autonomists defeated the pro-Serbian faction. Kulenoviƒá was also among those who made the Sarajevan Punctations, in which the YMO condemned the Serbian nationalist policy over Bosnia and Herzegovina and demanded Bosnian autonomy. After Mehmed Spaho, the President of the YMO, died, Kulenoviƒá was elected as the organization's new president on 29 June 1939. Uzeir Had≈æihasanoviƒá who was influential amongst the Muslims, helped him win this post. At this time, the YMO was in a coalition called the Yugoslav Radical Union (YRU); the coalition was led by Milan Stojadinoviƒá. The YMO's membership in the YRU threatened YMO's existence, and Kulenoviƒá tried to save the party. His actions led to the division in the YRU. During the tenures of prime ministers Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá and Du≈°an Simoviƒá, Kulenoviƒá was a minister without portfolio and Minister of Forestry and Mining. In 1939 Kulenoviƒá opposed the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina when the Banovina of Croatia was created, and he also opposed the idea of Serbian nationalist ministers and politicians that the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were not included in the Croatian Banovina, should be included in Serbian lands. During the German Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Kulenoviƒá didn't leave the country as most ministers did; he secretly left Belgrade and went to U≈æice, from where he went to Sarajevo and later to Brƒçko, where his family lived. Independent State of Croatia He became the Deputy Prime Minister of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in November 1941 and held the position until the end of the war. He had succeeded his older brother Osman Kulenoviƒá in this position. At the end of the war he fled to Austria. He was apprehended by British forces and sent to their detention centre at Spittal an der Drau on 17 May. He arrived one day after a group of NDH government officials had been sent back to Yugoslavia. In September he escaped from a military hospital in Villach. Emigration Kulenoviƒá lived in Italy until 1948, then immigrated with his family to Syria. He lived there until his death on 3 October 1956 in Damascus. While in Syria, the expatriate Croat community in Argentina published a collection of his journalistic writings. In 1950, the Bosnian Muslim Community in Chicago published a speech he wrote for the Muslim Congress following World War II in Lahore, Pakistan. A few months before Kulenoviƒá's death, the Croatian Liberation Movement was formed, with Kulenoviƒá as a founder and signatory. His son, Nahid continued working with this Movement, but was assassinated by the UDBA in Munich in 1969.‚ÄúExiles Speak of Yugoslav Death List‚Äù, The Times of London, 2 July 1969.

Humphrey advances a hypothesis about consciousness that has been criticised as speculative. Summary Humphrey describes his book as \\"a partial history of a part of what constitutes the human mind: an evolutionary history of how sensory consciousness has come into the world and what it is doing there.\\" He discusses the views of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the philosophers Colin McGinn and Daniel Dennett, and the phenomenon known as blindsight, in which people who are blind in a large part of the visual field nevertheless retain \\"certain perceptual faculties\\" and apparently have \\"perception without sensation\\". Publication history A History of the Mind was first published by Chatto & Windus in 1992. In 1993, it was published by Vintage Books. Reception A History of the Mind received positive reviews from the science journalist Marek Kohn in New Statesman and Society, Francisca Goldsmith in Library Journal, and from Publishers Weekly, mixed reviews from the biologist Lewis Wolpert in New Scientist and the psychologist George Armitage Miller in The New York Times Book Review, and negative reviews from John C. Marshall in The Times Literary Supplement and McGinn in the London Review of Books. Kohn described the book as \\"absorbing and stimulating\\". It referred to Humphrey's style of writing as \\"personal and informal\\". Goldsmith wrote that the book would appeal to both \\"interested lay readers\\" and scholars. Publishers Weekly described the book as \\"highly stimulating\\" and \\"unorthodox\\". It credited Humphrey with \\"Lightening his often technical discussion with thought experiments, drawings and illustrative examples\\". Wolpert considered the book's title misleading, arguing that its primary subject was consciousness. Though he found the book clever and well-written, he believed that, like similar books by other authors, it failed to \\"illuminate what consciousness is about.\\" Miller described the book as \\"readable and entertaining\\" and \\"stimulating\\", but wrote that it might leave readers wondering why the problem of consciousness had been considered so difficult. He questioned Humphrey's account of blindsight and his treatment of mental imagery, maintaining that its shortcomings undermined his arguments. He compared A History of the Mind to the physicist Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time (1988), though he considered it unlikely to enjoy similar success. Marshall criticised Humphrey's style of writing and wrote that his \\"account of the evolutionary development of consciousness\\" was \\"highly speculative\\" and so lacking in precision and detail that it was questionable whether it could be considered a theory. He added that Humphrey's comparison of the senses of vision and hearing to those of touch, pain, smell and taste was contradicted by physiological evidence. McGinn described the book as \\"bold and speculative\\", and credited Humphrey with making interesting observations about topics such as the \\"affective dimensions of colour\\" and blindsight. Nevertheless, he dismissed his theory of consciousness as a \\"dismal failure\\", arguing that explaining consciousness was so difficult as to be impossible. He also believed that Humphrey's theory suffered from a \\"mixture of obscurity and circularity\\" and that he failed to \\"give any account of the representational character of sensory experience.\\" A History of the Mind received a positive review from The Lancet, which described the book as an \\"entertaining and well- thought out work\\" and Humphrey's attempt to \\"solve the riddle of perception, sensation, and consciousness\\" as brave. It considered his ideas a possible basis for \\"a new neurophysiology\\", but criticised him for misinterpreting Coleridge. The author Richard Webster called A History of the Mind one of the most interesting attempts to solve the mind‚Äìbody problem. He suggested that Humphrey succeeded in eliminating mind-body dualism entirely, although he noted that details of Humphrey's hypothesis remain speculative and open to criticism and that the hypothesis was rejected by McGinn. The paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, writing with Blake Edgar, noted that Humphrey's hypothesis about consciousness places a different emphasis on feeling and thinking than the hypothesis about consciousness put forward by Dennett in Consciousness Explained (1991).

The castle was built by the earls of Lechsgem√ºnde beginning in the late 12th century, and came under the control of the Archbishop of Salzburg in the 13th century. During the 15th century, a second storey was added to the structure by Austrian noble Virgil von Graben from the Meinhardiner family. In 1485, the castle's chapel was completely rebuilt, and was consecrated by the Bishop of Caorle, Pietro Carlo, in October of that year. Both the addition of the second storey and the chapel construction were recorded by Paolo Santonino, an Italian humanist known for his travel diaries. The area was ceded to the Kingdom of Bavaria during the Napoleonic Wars and was returned to Austrian control after the Congress of Vienna. Lengberg Castle passed into private ownership beginning in 1821. It was used as a hospital during an 1831 cholera epidemic. Purchased by a Dutch businessman in the early 20th century, it was extensively renovated to return it to an inhabitable state. A reconstruction project in 2008 uncovered a hidden vault on the second floor ‚Äì likely built during the addition of the upper level ‚Äì containing debris from the 15th century.

The screenplay was written by Andrew Davies, who revealed that the aim of the series was to make viewers forget Ang Lee's 1995 film Sense and Sensibility. The series was \\"more overtly sexual\\" than previous Austen adaptations, and Davies included scenes featuring a seduction and a duel that were absent from the feature film but are included in Austen's book. Sense and Sensibility was directed by John Alexander and produced by Anne Pivcevic. Hattie Morahan and Charity Wakefield starred as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who go on \\"a voyage of burgeoning sexual and romantic discovery\\". The series was shot on location in the English counties of Berkshire, Surrey, Buckinghamshire and Devon for two months from April 2007. Sense and Sensibility was co-produced by the BBC and American studio WGBH Boston. It was aired in three parts from 1 January 2008 in the United Kingdom and attracted an average of 6 million viewers per episode. The first episode also became one of the top ten most streamed programmes on the BBC iPlayer. Sense and Sensibility garnered mostly positive reviews from television critics, while the cast and crew earned several award nominations for their work. It was released on a two-disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008. Plot When Henry Dashwood (Simon Williams) dies, he leaves his entire fortune and his home, Norland Park, to his son John (Mark Gatiss). John promises that he will provide for his stepmother, Mary Dashwood (Janet McTeer), and half-sisters Elinor (Hattie Morahan), Marianne (Charity Wakefield), and Margaret (Lucy Boynton). However, John's wife, Fanny (Claire Skinner), convinces him to make a much smaller provision than he had originally intended. In addition, they will have to leave Norland Park as it now belongs to John Dashwood. Fanny's brother, Edward Ferrars (Dan Stevens), comes to visit, and he quickly befriends Elinor. While Mrs. Dashwood hopes they will become engaged, Fanny informs her that his mother will not approve the match. Mrs. Dashwood receives a letter from her cousin, Sir John Middleton (Mark Williams), offering her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters decide to leave Norland immediately. During a welcome dinner at Barton Park, Sir John introduces the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton (Rosanna Lavelle); her mother, Mrs. Jennings (Linda Bassett); and their family friend, Colonel Brandon (David Morrissey). Brandon instantly falls in love with Marianne, but she believes that he is too old for her. While out walking with Margaret, Marianne falls and twists her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as John Willoughby (Dominic Cooper), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on whether they have become secretly engaged. Brandon invites the Dashwoods and the Middletons to a party on his estate at Delaford, but before the trip can take place, he is called away on urgent business. Willoughby requests a private audience with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne, leading them both to expect that he will propose. However, Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London, and he may not be able to return to Devonshire for at least a year. Shortly after Willoughby's departure, Edward comes to visit, and the Dashwoods notice that he appears to be unhappy and distant. Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy (Anna Madeley) and Anne Steele (Daisy Haggard), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news which devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby there. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters. During a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but he barely acknowledges their acquaintance. Marianne later learns that he is engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced and then abandoned when pregnant Brandon's young ward, Eliza Williams, who has subsequently given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter on the way back to Devon, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her back indoors, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, but he had to marry a rich woman because his aunt had disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon. Production =Conception and adaptation= On 5 October 2005, a reporter for the BBC News revealed that writer Andrew Davies was planning to adapt Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility into a major television drama due to be broadcast on the BBC in two years. Davies commented, \\"When they are great stories, you keep on coming back to them and doing them in different ways with different people at different lengths.\\" Davies explained that his script was in the early stages and that no actors had yet been cast. The writer later expressed his delight at adapting the novel during an interview with Paul Carey from the Western Mail, calling Austen his \\"favourite novelist\\". He also admitted that due to the acclaim he received for his adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, there was pressure on him to get Sense and Sensibility right. Davies later stated that the aim of the miniseries was to make viewers forget about Ang Lee's 1995 film adaptation of the novel. The opening episode of Sense and Sensibility features the moment Willoughby seduces Eliza, who is still a schoolgirl. Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the Western Mail that he wanted \\"to do justice\\" to Willoughby's back story, saying that it is \\"quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that goes on and is just talked about. I want to put it on the screen.\\" Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent's Peter Chapman, saying that the seduction and abandonment of a schoolgirl which features in the novel needed dramatising. He believed readers of the novel \\"hardly notice\\" the moment, which he felt was very important. The writer noted that the series was \\"more overtly sexual\\" than previous adaptations of Austen's works and added, \\"The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions.\\" Davies also included a duel between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby in his screenplay, an event that was absent from Lee's film adaptation of the novel, but is mentioned in the original novel. Davies believed that Lee's film did not overcome \\"the problem of the guys who get the girls not seeming quite good enough\\", and set out to try to find a way of making them into heroes in his script. He said that Austen should have made the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how Marianne falls in love with Colonel Brandon, after having her heart broken by Willoughby. The writer added more weight to the male roles, so they could be turned into stronger characters. Davies told Hill that the team \\"worked very hard\\" on the men. Brandon is seen rescuing people and doing a lot of fast horse riding, while Edward was given a wood-chopping scene where he vents his frustrations about his engagement. Davies also made the Dashwood sisters younger and \\"more vulnerable\\" than they were portrayed in Lee's film. Hattie Morahan, who portrayed Elinor in the drama, stated, \\"We are trying to play the story as it was written. In the novel the girls are 19 and 17, so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them.\\" =Casting= Davies commented that he would have liked to have been in charge of the casting. He revealed that he had initially objected to Hattie Morahan being cast in the role of the eldest Dashwood sister, Elinor. However, he was glad that his objections were ignored, because he fell in love with her performance. Morahan told The Daily Telegraph's Jasper Rees that she deliberately chose not to watch the 1995 film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility or think about Emma Thompson's portrayal of the character. She explained that she had not \\"[b]ecause you would go mad. It would distort your work. I thought, it'll be original by virtue of the fact that it's me doing it and there is only one me.\\" Charity Wakefield successfully auditioned for the role of Marianne Dashwood. The actress said, \\"Marianne is the embodiment of youth and hope. I was so excited to be offered the part because I felt that it was a role which I could really attack. I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common.\\" Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars, Elinor's love interest. The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series. David Morrissey portrayed Colonel Brandon. The actor was sent the script by his agent, and he initially questioned whether another Austen adaptation was needed. However, he then read the script and thought it was \\"just brilliant\\", especially as Davies had added more scenes featuring the male characters. Dominic Cooper took on the role of John Willoughby, Brandon's rival for Marianne's affections. Describing his character, Cooper said \\"The way I tried to persuade myself he wasn't too bad was that he's a 25-year-old young guy and he genuinely falls in love with Marianne ‚Äì he's not just doing it for one moment in time.\\" Cooper said that he had fun working on the project. Janet McTeer and Lucy Boynton were cast as Mrs Dashwood and Margaret Dashwood respectively. Mark Gatiss portrayed John Dashwood. Claire Skinner received the role of John's wife, Fanny, while Mark Williams was cast as Sir John Middleton. Linda Bassett and Jean Marsh were given the roles of Mrs Jennings and Mrs Ferrars respectively. Robert Bianco from USA Today commented that both women were \\"wonderfully cast\\". Actresses Anna Madeley and Daisy Haggard portrayed Lucy Steele and her sister Anne, a character who was omitted from the 1995 film. =Filming= Loseley Park served as the exterior of Barton Park, home of the Middleton family. Sense and Sensibility was shot entirely on location within England, mostly in the counties of Berkshire, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, and Devon. Filming began in April 2007 and lasted until early June. Blackpool Mill, a fifteenth-century cottage in north Devon, was turned into Barton Cottage, the home of the Dashwood girls. The art director for the series, James Merifield, had walked past the cottage in 2006 and thought it would be an ideal setting for a film. He was later sent back to the cottage by the location manager for Sense and Sensibility, and he decided the place would be right for the production. The owners of Blackpool Mill, Sir Hugh and Lady Stucley, were contacted in February 2007 by the BBC who inquired about the possibility of filming there. Caroline Gammell from The Daily Telegraph reported that \\"camera crews, production assistants, directors and actors swarmed over Blackpool Mill, turning the rustic four-bedroom home into the romantic hub of Jane Austen's novel. Set designers took the cottage more firmly into the 19th century, adding a porch at the front as well as dormer windows, fake shutters and an extra chimney.\\" The interior of cottage was \\"a little scruffy\\" for Mrs Dashwood's status, so scenes featuring the inside of the cottage were filmed in a studio. Filming took place at the cottage over eight days in May. Wakefield revealed that it rained constantly during filming, often soaking the cast and crew. However, the bad weather led to Davies writing in a scene featuring Edward in a wet shirt chopping logs in the rain, which rivalled the famous lake scene in Pride and Prejudice. Cooper told The Birmingham Post's Georgina Rodgers that the bad weather affected his first scene, in which Willoughby carries an injured Marianne home. He explained that the scene was shot on a vertical slope with a rain machine, as the natural rain does not show up on camera. His cloak also kept getting caught under his foot, which made picking up Wakefield even harder. Cooper added, \\"I couldn't move and I just kept falling head over heels.\\" Wrotham Park served as the exterior to Norland, the Dashwood family's home. Ham House in Richmond was used for Norland's interior shots, while the grounds were used for exterior scenes. The National Trust was asked not to cut the grass for several weeks before filming began. Ham House also doubled for Cleveland. Loseley Park was chosen for the exterior shots of Sir John Middleton's home, Barton Park. The library doubled for Colonel Brandon's own, while the entrance was used for scenes featuring a gathering of guests for a day out. The Oak Room was also used for the scenes involving Marianne, after she falls sick. Other filming locations included Dorney Court, Hall Barn, Lincoln's Inn and Clovelly Pier. =Costumes and make-up= The costume designer for Sense and Sensibility was Michele Clapton. She and assistant costume designer Alex Fordham undertook a large amount of research looking for inspiration. They spent hours looking at paintings and books from the time period, while also visiting art galleries and the Victoria and Albert Museum. During an interview for the drama's BBC Online website, Fordham revealed that they tried to find references from every area, including eighteenth-century cartoons. Clapton stated that the team wanted to make a lot of the costumes, rather than re-use what was already available from other productions. To get the sense of colour that they wanted, they had to dye and create a lot of the pieces. The wardrobe team worked closely with the make-up department and the production designer. After their first meeting, they came up with a colour palette for the whole show. Clapton chose to give Elinor and Marianne contrasting wardrobes. The \\"flighty\\" and \\"artistic\\" Marianne wears strong colours compared to Elinor, who has a different personality and complexion. Fordham revealed that with Marianne being younger and a \\"wild child\\", her wardrobe contains a lot of Buttercup yellows, which suited Wakefield's complexion and her character's freshness. Willoughby's wardrobe was designed to reflect his \\"poetic\\" and \\"fashionable\\" nature, while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth-century rural colours. With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed to be out of date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, \\"Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home.\\" She added that the director had wanted the characters to \\"feel more human.\\" Morrissey commented that the period costumes were \\"slightly uncomfortable\\" for modern life, but as soon as the cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made that way. He added, \\"When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture ‚Äì posture was different then, and that's important. But they give you a feel for the character which is really an advantage to you as an actor.\\" Karen Hartley-Thomas was the hair and make-up designer for the production. She began prepping a couple of months before filming began, and she met with the director and producer early on to discuss the whole look of the film. Like the costumers, she read books and went to art galleries during her research. The female characters in Sense and Sensibility wear a \\"no make-up look\\" because in the time period in which the film is set, only the lower classes would have worn white and pink make-up. The Dashwood sisters wore no mascara and only a little corrective and blush. Hartley-Thomas also used very little make-up on the men, as she does not like them looking made up. Discussing the hair, Hartley-Thomas said \\"Elinor's hair is always quite neat and done, where Marianne, being a freer character and more rebellious, she has lots of different looks and lots of wild looks with the hair loose.\\" She also explained that some of the male actors wore wigs because the men in those days would have had a lot more volume to their hair, whereas the modern styles tend to be shorter and clippered. John Dashwood and his son were given red hair, as Hartley-Thomas wanted them to stand out amongst the more natural colours of the other male characters. Broadcast Sense and Sensibility was aired in the UK in three parts, with the first shown on 1 January 2008. The other two episodes were broadcast on 6 and 13 January. The first episode of Sense and Sensibility became one of the top ten streamed programmes on the BBC iPlayer following its broadcast. In the United States, Sense and Sensibility was broadcast on PBS, as part of their Austen Masterpiece Theatre series. The drama was split into two episodes, which aired on 30 March and 6 April 2008. Sense and Sensibility began airing from 26 June 2008 on the UKTV channel in Australia. =Home media= Sense and Sensibility was released on a two-disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008. The Region 1 DVD was released a few days after its premiere on PBS. The two-disc set also included the BBC's Miss Austen Regrets, as well as commentary and interviews from the cast and crew. Reception =Ratings= The first episode of Sense and Sensibility attracted 5.54 million viewers upon its first broadcast in the United Kingdom, giving it twenty per cent of the audience share for its broadcast time. The second episode posted a small increase of 5.74 million viewers, while the concluding part attracted an audience of 6.76 million. =Critical response= Sense and Sensibility received mostly positive reviews from critics. Melinda Houston, writing for The Age, called Sense and Sensibility \\"a gorgeous adaptation of her most frivolous work\\" and added, \\"It's all beautifully made, beautifully cast, and the script snaps and crackles. Maybe isn't quite as flawed as originally drawn but that's unlikely to detract from your enjoyment.\\" Lenny Ann Low from The Sydney Morning Herald stated, \\"The locations, costumes and acting are excellent, with a particularly striking use of light ‚Äì cold and grey skies foretelling doom through to rich candlelight signalling new passions.\\" The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante said, \\"There's nothing glaringly wrong with this new Sense and Sensibility, the last in Masterpiece's winter-long homage to Austen; it is both lush and tidy. But it alters the emotional chemistry, and the result is an adaptation that feels more arid than Mr. Lee's effort.\\" Nancy Banks-Smith from The Guardian called Sense and Sensibility \\"a charmingly domestic and spontaneous treatment of the story\\", adding that it had become \\"a younger sister\\" of Lee's 1995 film. Variety's Brian Lowry commented, \\"this latest Sense & Sensibility has done a splendid job casting its various roles, despite an inevitable wattage deficit compared with the most recent theatrical version. Davies and director John Alexander have also taken some liberties by crafting scenes of the men together (something Austen herself never did) ‚Äì having the steely Brandon, for example, pull Willoughby aside to question his intentions toward Marianne. Featuring a top-drawer cast, the filmmakers create several delicate moments ‚Äì from Willoughby's elegant seduction of Marianne to the stoic Elinor's pining for the elusive Edward who, as played by Stevens, adorably stammers in a Hugh Grant-like way.\\" Serena Davies from The Daily Telegraph praised the first episode, calling it \\"faithful to the spirit of the book\\" and stating that the series \\"deftly stepped out of the shadows of two formidable predecessors: Ang Lee's gorgeous 1995 film version of the novel, and scriptwriter Andrew Davies's own masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice.\\" Davies enjoyed Morahan's \\"luminous\\" performance as Elinor, as well as Williams and Morrissey's turns as Sir John and Colonel Brandon respectively, although she thought the opening scene was \\"misconceived\\". Davies' colleague, James Walton, proclaimed, \\"In the end, this Sense and Sensibility was perhaps brilliantly competent rather than surpassingly brilliant. Nevertheless, it still proved easily good enough to get the costume-drama year off to a hugely enjoyable start.\\" =Awards and nominations= The crew of Sense and Sensibility garnered several award nominations for their work on the drama. At the 14th Shanghai Television Festival, the series was nominated for Magnolia Award for Best Television Film or Miniseries, Alexander won the Best Television Film Director award, while Morahan won Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Film for her turn as Elinor Dashwood. Davies was nominated in the Writer's Award category at the 35th Broadcasting Press Guild Awards for his screenplay, and Clapton received a nomination for Outstanding Costume Design for a Television Movie or Mini-Series at the Costume Designers Guild Awards. For his work on the score, Phipps earned nominations for a BAFTA Television Craft Award for Best Original Television Music and a Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie or Special. Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt was also nominated for an Emmy Award in the Cinematography for a Miniseries, Movie or Special category.

His style of work has been referred to as \\"Armageddon-like blood-and-guts crime reporting\\".Bayens \\"Who is That Man?\\" Christopher has filed stories across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, with most of his journalistic career focused on Western Canada, often reporting on criminal justice. During the two decades that he worked for The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and for 630 CHED, he won national awards for both his print and radio journalism. He is known for his ability to secure exclusive interviews with convicted criminals, and is sometimes the only media source that high-profile criminals will contact. His investigation into alleged illegal activity by Calgary-based Talisman Energy was reported worldwide, and eventually forced the company to suspend its operations in Sudan. Biography =Early life= Christopher was born in Campbellton, New Brunswick, Canada. He began his broadcasting career in 1965, working as a sports reader for a local radio station, CKNB, while he was attending high school in Campbellton. After graduating in 1967, Christopher worked for a year and a half as a disc jockey at CKMR Radio in Newcastle, New Brunswick. After working with CKMR, Christopher was hired to work as a DJ at CFOM Radio in Quebec City. Christopher later commented that he was surprised to have been hired to work in Quebec, \\"since [his] French vocabulary at the time consisted [only] of the word 'Chevrolet'\\".McNally After working in Quebec, Christopher worked as a radio and television news announcer in Dawson Creek, British Columbia. In 1970 Christopher moved to South Australia, where he worked for two Australian media outlets, Radio 5AU and GTS Television. Christopher returned to Canada in 1972, and has since pursued news assignments in the United States, Poland, Germany, Austria, England, Scotland, Wales, Nepal, and Nicaragua. Most of his subsequent reporting has been focused on Western Canada. =Work with the CBC= Christopher worked from 1981 to 1995 for CBC Radio News and CBC Radio Current Affairs, in Edmonton, Alberta. Over the course of his first decade in Edmonton, Christopher established himself as a criminal justice reporter, and for working with subjects convicted of serious crimes. Throughout his career, Christopher has had exclusive interviews with many locally and nationally well-known criminals, including Michael White, Colin Thatcher, Wiebo Ludwig, Leo Teskey, Anton Rapati, and Karl Toft. In 1984 Christopher was one of the first reporters to investigate a small commuter plane crash in northern Alberta, in which six people were killed. By developing a rapport with survivors and local residents he was one of the few investigating reporters present to succeed in interviewing those related to the incident. He was later interviewed as a primary source for author Carol Shaben's book on the crash, Into the Abyss.Shaben pp.173, 204-207 In 1991 Christopher received a national award from the Canadian Association of Journalists for \\"outstanding investigative journalism\\", recognizing his work uncovering new details concerning a double homicide in Saskatchewan. In 1992 Christopher became the first reporter to interview David Milgaard when Milgaard was released from prison after serving twenty-two years for a wrongful murder conviction. Christopher's interview with Milgaard was the inspiration for the line \\"and a late-breaking story on the CBC\\" in the song \\"Wheat Kings\\" by The Tragically Hip.Bayens \\"Thomas George Svekla ‚Äì Trial ‚Äì 3\\" After leaving the CBC, Christopher taught journalism briefly at Grant MacEwan Community College. In 1997 Christopher accompanied a group of four First Nations students from Grant MacEwan on a fact-finding tour of Germany and Austria, meeting with local groups interested in the culture of North American Native peoples.Sweetgrass Staff =Work with 630 CHED= From 1996 to 2008 Christopher worked as a news reporter for CHED, an Edmonton-based talk radio station. In 2001 he taught a course in journalism at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology,NAITline p.1 and in the same year wrote a story for the Pakistan News Service about how the War in Afghanistan was perceived by the Canadian news community. He deferred his payment for the story to \\"a needy Pakistani journalism student\\". In 2002 Christopher discovered that a Calgary- based oil company, Talisman Energy, had been accused of complicity in the rape, bombing, kidnapping, enslavement, and execution of local people while operating in South Sudan. Talisman executives made it clear that they were uncomfortable with Christopher investigating the story, and sent a letter to CHED threatening to sue the company for libel if the story was ever reported. After Christopher filed the story the station refused to report it. Christopher attempted to have the story carried by other local media companies, including Global TV and The Edmonton Journal; they refused to run the story.Ende After being rejected by a number of local media companies, Christopher succeeded in having his Talisman story published by a small online magazine that specializes in publishing un- and under-reported news stories, rabble.ca. About a week later Christopher's article on Rabble was noticed by the Financial Times of London. After the Financial Times ran the Tailsman story, it was noticed by other news services and was circulated globally via the Associated Press, Canadian Press, and Reuters. The negative publicity caused by Christopher's article forced Talisman to suspend its operations in Sudan within about a year, but local media never carried the article. In 2007 Christopher spoke on a panel to a group of international journalists in Toronto on the subject of how to respond when targeted by police search warrants. He once joked with an interviewer about his having been subject to half-a-dozen search warrants, \\"more than the average drug-dealer in Detroit\\". Christopher left 630 CHED in 2008, and is now working as a freelance journalist in Edmonton. =Correspondence with Richard Lee McNair= Richard Lee McNair is a convicted American murderer, serving a life sentence for a homicide that he committed in 1987. He has escaped from a number of prisons over the period of his incarceration; and, after his second recapture in 1993, McNair was deemed problematic and transferred to a federal prison near Pollock, Louisiana. In 2006 McNair successfully shipped himself out of prison, convinced a police officer searching for him that he was a roofer working in the area, and escaped to Canada.America's Most Wanted McNair lived as a fugitive in Canada for over a year, travelling across the country before being apprehended in Christopher's hometown of Campbellton.CBC News In 2008 Christopher began a correspondence with McNair via mail. In his first letter, Christopher included a picture that he had taken of the town, taken near the place that McNair was arrested. He told McNair that he hoped the Campbellton Chamber of Commerce would write a cheque to McNair for all the publicity he had brought to the town, and wrote to McNair about the recent World Series and federal election. Christopher included three American dollars in order to cover the cost of paper and postage; the prison returned his money.Bayens \\"Richard Lee McNair\\" When McNair wrote back to Christopher, it was his first response to the media. The letter revealed many personal details about McNair's most recent escape which had previously been unknown. Campbellton's local newspaper, The Tribune, covered their continuing correspondence in detail, publishing Christopher's award-winning series of articles on McNair under the title \\"The Running Man\\".Atlantic Community Newspapers Association p.22 In subsequent letters to Christopher, McNair revealed details about his escape and travels through Canada, providing most of what the public knows about McNair's time as a fugitive. Christopher compiled his correspondence, conducted additional research on the story, and eventually produced a book on McNair, The Man Who Mailed Himself Out of Jail.

It campaigns against homosexuality and Islamic-American relations. The organization is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. In 2013 the New York Times noted FFA was a one-man Christian fundamentalist organization. History David Caton founded the organization now known as the Florida Family Association in 1987, which at the time, was operating as the American Family Association. In 1990, he authored the book, Overcoming the Addiction to Pornography. Bill Dedman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist wrote an article about the AFA in 1992 titled \\"Bible Belt Blowhard\\" that chronicled the group, and wrote that Caton had \\"been hooked for years on liquor, marijuana, cocaine, Quaaludes, Ativan, and masturbation.\\"Bill Dedman, \\"Bible Belt Blowhard\\", Mother Jones, November‚ÄìDecember 1992 Caton eventually broke off from the AFA and set up the FFA where he is Executive Director. The AFA, also labeled a hate group, is considered to be more mainstream than the FFA according to The New York Times.Samuel G. Freedman, \\"Waging a One-Man War on American Muslims\\" , New York Times (December 17, 2011). According to the New York Times, the FFA operates with Caton serving as the only employee. The newspaper reported in December 2011 that Caton \\"aimed almost entirely at homosexuals\\" for 15 years, but that in the previous two years had \\"largely dropped the anti-gay banner in favour of a new villain: American Muslims\\". Anti-gay activities The Florida Family Association compared gay children to murderers in a 1998 protest of the Gay-Straight Alliance, a club formed at Largo High School in Florida for children being harassed. Principal Barbara Thornton said the FFA had \\"launched a vicious attack against our students.\\" Thornton also noted that despite their protest, the FFA was unsuccessful as the student population rallied behind the club. In August 2012, Caton created a derogatory term for transvestites, combining the word with homosexual to create \\"transmo.\\" =Legislation= The FFA unsuccessfully opposed an Orlando city ordinance to provide job and housing protection to gays, and an anti-bullying bill aimed at banning bullying based on a student's sexual orientation. The group has also opposed the passage of a human rights ordinance that would expand protection to gays, lesbians and bisexuals, while also opposing a measure that would protect transgender people from discrimination. =Entertainment= The FFA also targeted the television series \\"Degrassi: The Next Generation\\" and asked advertisers to pull their ads. After the FFA claimed victory in Kodak stopping their ads, Kodak said in a statement that their ads were stopped as part of a \\"planned pause\\" and would continue the following week. The FFA has flown banners by airplane over Walt Disney World that state: \\"WARNING GAY DAY AT DISNEY,\\" and did so similarly prior to a Lady Gaga concert, with the banner reading \\"NOT BORN THIS WAY.\\" Anti-Muslim activities In 2011, the Florida Family Association campaigned against advertisers of the TLC show \\"All- American Muslim.\\" The reality show stars five Muslim families in Dearborn, Michigan. The FFA claimed that the absence of radical Muslims actually advances Islamic fundamentalism, citing the fact that the show did not portray Muslims as terrorists. Caton compared Muslims to snakes in an interview with the Associated Press. The FFA emailed advertisers demanding they stop advertising during the show. Lowe's pulled their ads and then faced nationwide protests due to their decision and issued an apology. In their statement, Lowe's said it has \\"a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion.\\" The FFA has also called on schools to stop visits from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an organization that facilitates speaking engagements to educate on stereotypes, human rights and women in Islam. An Orlando reverend, Joel Hunter, voiced opposition to intolerance against Muslims and subsequently received hundreds of emails and letters from the FFA, one of which said, \\"I hope your family dies in a fire.\\" In September 2013, the FFA flew a banner before a Cincinnati Bengals football game that targeted Procter & Gamble due to their advertisements airing on television network Al Jazeera America.

According to United Nations officials, soldiers of the Croatian Army (HV) and Croatian police killed nine Croatian Serb villagers, all of whom were between the ages of 60 and 85. After the war, six former Croatian soldiers were tried for committing crimes in the village, but were all eventually released due to lack of evidence. In 2012, the Supreme Court of Croatia ruled that the Republic of Croatia was responsible for the killings, dubbing the massacre an \\"act of terrorism,\\" and the following year the municipal court in Knin announced that the Government of Croatia must provide compensation to the children of a couple who were murdered. Background Following the 1990 electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. This was followed by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency's approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991. After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency declare a state of emergency and grant the JNA wartime powers. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came under control of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Milo≈°eviƒá, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than preservation of Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents, and preventing Croatian police from intervening. In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede. In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde ‚Äì ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. On 25 June, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, officially severing ties on 8 October and a month later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV). Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the Croatian War of Independence, culminating in the Siege of Dubrovnik and the Battle of Vukovar. A campaign of ethnic cleansing then began in the RSK, expelling 170,000 to 250,000 Croats and non-Serbs with hundreds of Croats killed. In January 1992, an agreement to implement the peace plan negotiated by UN special envoy Cyrus Vance was signed by Croatia, the JNA and the UN. As a result, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) deployed to maintain the ceasefire, and the JNA was scheduled to retreat to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite the peace arrangement requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA remained on Croatian territory for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually withdrew, the JNA left their equipment to the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK), which Serbia continued to support. A state of stalemate ensued, lasting the next three-and-a-half years. In August 1995 the Croats launched Operation Storm, recapturing most Serb-controlled territory in Croatia and leading to as many as 200,000 Croatian Serbs to flee the country in fear or part of evacuation by the RSK. Killings On the night of 28 September 1995, Croatian soldiers entered the village of Varivode and killed nine elderly Serb villagers. The civilians that were killed were Jovan Beriƒá, Marko Beriƒá, Milka Beriƒá, Radivoje Beriƒá, Marija Beriƒá, Du≈°an Dukiƒá, Jovo Beriƒá, ≈†piro Beriƒá and Mirko Pokrajac. After the executions occurred, the bodies were buried in a cemetery near the village without the knowledge of the families of the victims. There were no witnesses to the massacre, although the survivors and relatives of the victims stated that people in military uniforms arrived in the village days before the attack, and robbed and abused the remaining Serb residents who had not left following Operation Storm. Aftermath After the massacre, Croatian authorities denied reports of widespread atrocities targeting Serbs and said that they were propaganda. Later, the government blamed the atrocities on uncontrollable elements within the Croatian Army and Croatian police. Christiane Amanpour's report from October 1995 said that the \\"United Nations believes 12 Serb civilians were massacred.\\" In the first one hundred days following Operation Storm, at least 150 Serb civilians were summarily executed, and many hundreds disappeared as part of a widespread campaign of revenge against Croatia's Serb minority. The bodies of the killed Serbs were never exhumed, autopsies were never performed and much of the evidence that could have been used against the perpetrators of the crime was discarded.Vesti online / Vesti / Ex YU / Hrvatska priznala masakr nad devetoro Srba u Varivodama Despite this, six Croatian soldiers were tried for committing crimes in the village. The soldiers were Ivan Jakovljeviƒá, Pero Perkoviƒá, Neƒëeljko Mijiƒá, Zlatko Ladoviƒá, Ivica Petriƒá and Nikola Ra≈°iƒá. All six were acquitted for the Varivode massacre as well as for killings in the village of Go≈°iƒá, although Petriƒá was found guilty and sentenced to six years for the murder of a civilian in the village of Zrmanja and Ra≈°iƒá was sentenced to a year in prison for attempted robbery and the attempted murder of a civilian in the municipality of Knin. The acquittal part of the verdict was quashed and a re-trial was ordered which ended in the dropping of charges and release of the accused in 2002 for lack of evidence. =Legal proceedings= The Varivode massacre was listed in the ICTY's indictment of Croatian wartime general Ante Gotovina. The Trial of Gotovina et al brought the convictions of Gotovina and Markaƒç and acquittal of ƒåermak in April 2011. Gotovina and Markaƒç were subsequently acquitted on appeal in November 2012, with the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY reversing the earlier judgement, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to prove the existence of a joint criminal enterprise to remove Serb civilians by force. The Appeals Chamber further stated that the Croatian Army and Special Police committed crimes after the artillery assault, but the state and military leadership had no role in their planning and creation. In July 2012, the Supreme Court of Croatia ruled that the Republic of Croatia was responsible for the deaths of the nine Serb villagers who were killed in Varivode. The Supreme Court declared, \\"two months after the conclusion of Operation Storm, an act of terrorism was committed against the Serb inhabitants of Varivode for the purpose of causing fear, hopelessness and to spread feelings of personal insecurity among the citizens.\\"Vrhovni sud: Hrvatska je odgovorna za zloƒçin u Varivodama! - Hrvatska / Novi list On 23 January 2013, the municipal court in Knin upheld that the Croatian government of the time was responsible for the killings in Varivode, and reiterated that the killings were an act of terrorism against the Serb inhabitants of the village. Furthermore, the court announced that the Croatian government must pay 540,000 kuna (‚Ç¨ 72,000) to the children of massacre-victims Radivoje and Marija Beriƒá. The European Commission welcomed the court's ruling, stating that the court had \\"addressed for the first time a long-standing grievance.\\" =Commemoration= President Ivo Josipoviƒá condemned the killings in 2010. A wooden monument was erected to commemorate the victims of the massacre. In April 2010, the plaque was destroyed by a Croatian war veteran and had to be rebuilt. The monument's destruction was condemned by then-Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor. \\"The Prime Minister called on the Interior Ministry and other institutions to launch an immediate investigation and to solve the case immediately, in order for the perpetrators to be found and punished for this act of vandalism,\\" the Croatian government stated. The rebuilt monument was unveiled by Croatian President Ivo Josipoviƒá on 10 May 2010. The new monument is built out of stone, has the names of the victims inscribed in both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, stands ten meters tall and cost the Croatian government 60,000 kuna to construct. The Croatian President stated, \\"retaliation, robbery and crime are impermissible, and the blood and shame cannot be washed away.\\" The nine Serbs were killed at a time when there was no war and they were innocent victims of retaliation, Josipoviƒá said while addressing the crowd of several hundred people after laying flowers at the monument. Milorad Pupovac, a Croatian Serb MP and president of the Serb National Council, stated, \\"We have decided to erect this monument for those who have been forgotten, for those whose suffering has gone unrecognized. We hope that the individuals responsible for this crime will be brought to justice and that the ones who tolerated it will show themselves. The possibility is open that we all, the Orthodox and Catholics, Croats and Serbs, after the erection of this monument to the ethnic Serbs civilians who suffered in the 1991‚Äì1995 war, can motion away from these things so that they no longer divide us so that we can all feel a mutual-responsibility to ensure that these crimes never happen again.\\" References 1995 in Croatia Mass murder in 1995 Croatian war crimes in the Croatian War of Independence Massacres in Croatia History of the Serbs of Croatia Massacres of Serbs September 1995 events in Europe ","title":"Varivode massacre"},{"id":"36503591","text":"The Literary London Society is a scholarly society based in the United Kingdom which promotes the study of the literature of London.

Early life  Diamanski, son of a marine engineer, graduated from community school, and went to sea from 1924 to 1935, working on German ships traveling between Germany, England, and the Soviet Union. At age 16, Diamanski became a member of the Young Communist League of Germany and in 1929 a full member of the Communist Party of Germany, KPD. In 1931, he went to the Reichsparteischule Rosa Luxemburg, a school run by the KPD in L√ºneburg. In 1932, at age 23, he married his first wife, Helene Schmidt, who, according to Diamanski's personal account, was shot later in the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, as he said to have heard from female prisoners of the concentration camp.Heiko Haumann: Hermann Diamanski: √úberleben in der Katastrophe: Eine deutsche Geschichte zwischen Auschwitz und Staatssicherheitsdienst (1910-1976), B√∂hlau Verlag, K√∂ln 2011, , p.18 After Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists seized power (Machtergreifung), Diamanski emigrated to England to avoid persecution of communists by the Nazis. From there he went to Spain in October 1937 to fight in the Spanish Civil War against the Nationalists around general Francisco Franco. Diamanski was a member of the XI International Brigade and later fought in the 3rd artillery battalion. After the defeat of the Republicans, Diamanski fled to Belgium, then France and returned to Spain, where he was arrested in Barcelona in 1940 by German agents and deported to Germany, where he was handed over to the Gestapo.  Concentration camps  The first stop on his journey through many German prisons and concentration camps was the Welzheim concentration camp (KZ Welzheim), where he spent several weeks in the most miserable living and human conditions. Probably because they were hoping for some significant information, the Gestapo moved him soon to its prison in the Gestapo headquarters in Berlin, located at the Reich Main Security Office at Prinz- Albrecht-Stra√üe 8. During his imprisonment in Berlin, Diamanski had to endure constant questioning and torture. He reports that one night, he was pulled out of his cell, put up against a wall and shot at - albeit with blanks as he realized after the first shock and thoughts of dying. In subsequent weeks he shared a cell with Wilhelm Boger, a Hauptsturmf√ºhrer of the SS who was imprisoned for atrocities that according to Diamanski, were \\"even too much for the SS\\"Hermann Diamanski: Vernehmungsprotokolle des Auschwitzprozesses, Vernehmungen vom 9.12.1958 und 21.4.1959, Fritz-Bauer-Institut, Frankfurt am Main (Translation: Daniel Schwizer) at the time. While in the same cell, he shared some of his Red Cross Christmas packets with Boger, which later benefitted Diamanski, when Boger was the head of the Auschwitz concentration camp. In February 1941, Diamanski was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp where in the fall of that year, he was assigned to forced labor groups (Forced Labor in Germany during World War II) in a steel plant and later in a Gestapo school near Dr√∂gen. In May 1942, Diamanski was transferred to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was interned at Auschwitz-Monowitz, also known as Auschwitz III. Because he was suspected of having contracted typhus, he was moved to Auschwitz-Birkenau, together with other prisoners. In the men's prison of Auschwitz-Birkenau he became a privileged prisoner, because he saved the SS camp warden Erna Hermann and her child from drowning when he was in Dr√∂gen the year before. He also knew the supervisor of the Schutzhaftlager (protective custody camp), Johann Schwarzhuber from Sachsenhausen, and as a result, became block leader of Block 9 in the men's camp. Later, he became camp leader of the men's camp and eventually camp leader of the gypsy camp (Zigeunerlager Auschwitz) within Auschwitz-Birkenau, used to imprison and kill members of the Sinti and Roma people. Rather than abuse his privileges in the camp, as many of the Kapos and camp leaders did, Diamanski used them to help fellow prisoners and participate in the organization of prisoner resistance. According to his own account, he participated in a conspiracy against the brutal Rapportf√ºhrer Gerhard Palitzsch, that eventually led to Palitzsch being removed from his post. Diamanski, according to camp jargon called \\"Zigeunerbaron\\"Heiko Haumann: Hermann Diamanski: √úberleben in der Katastrophe: Eine deutsche Geschichte zwischen Auschwitz und Staatssicherheitsdienst (1910-1976), B√∂hlau Verlag, K√∂ln 2011, , p.138 (gypsy baron), supported his fellow prisoners, for example, by organizing food supplies, or even saving other communists from the gas chambers. \\"Because of his humanitarian attitude, he gave many thousands in the Auschwitz camp the courage to survive. Countless people are still alive today, because of his personal efforts and dedication.\\"Fritz Hirsch: Vernehmungsprotokolle des Auschwitzprozesses, Vernehmungen vom 13., 17., 24., 27.2., 2.3.1959, Fritz-Bauer-Institut, Frankfurt am Main (Translation: Daniel Schwizer) Because of his support and participation in the resistance, he was removed from his position as camp leader during summer of 1944, and moved to the Strafkompanie, the penal work division of the concentration camp. From there, he returned to Auschwitz-Birkenau and worked in the pump station. After the evacuation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, Diamanski walked in a death march via Gleiwitz to the Buchenwald concentration camp (almost 700 km, 420 miles). About 60,000 prisoners were marched out of Auschwitz at that time, of which at least 15,000 died on the journey.Yad Vashem, The Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority: Death Marches http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206260.pdf Retrieved on July 26, 2012 From Buchenwald, Diamanski was freed on April 11, 1945 by members of the US military.  After the war  = East Germany = After the end of the war, Diamanski worked as an interpreter for the US military as well as in a transportation company. In 1946, he was married a second time, for a few months, and in 1947, he married his third wife. In June 1947, after having been unemployed for almost a year, he and his wife moved to the Soviet occupation zone, where Diamanski joined the Schutzpolizei, the state level police of Thuringia. After several promotions he joined the Volkspolizei, the federal police, in 1947, and later, in September 1948, the Grenzpolizei. Because of accusations that later proved unsustainable, Diamanski was suspended for a few months, but in June 1949 he was reinstated into the police service, and transferred to the Wasserschutzpolizei in Schwerin, in the north of the Soviet occupation zone. Because of \\"western lifestyle\\" of his wife and being suspected of collaboration with the Counter Intelligence Corps he was removed from police service in December 1950. He became a teacher and temporarily deputy director of the Marine Navigation College in Wustrow. Because of an accusation that Diamanski was in West-Berlin without official permission, he was transferred to Magdeburg where was given a position of cultural director for the Deutsche Schiffahrts- und Umschlagszentrale the socialist organization owning and operating all previously private inland waterway vessels in East Germany.DDR Binnenschiffahrt - Historie und Verbleib: http://www.ddr-binnenschifffahrt.de/index.htm Retrieved on July 25, 2012 = Back in the West = In spring of 1953, Diamanski and his family illegally moved to West-Berlin, where he started working for the US Central Intelligence Group, the precursor to the CIA.History of the CIA https://www.cia.gov/about- cia/history-of-the-cia/index.html Retrieved on July 25, 2012 Until 1970, Diamanski was under surveillance from the East German Ministerium f√ºr Staatssicherheit, also known as the Stasi. In December 1953, Diamanski and his family moved to the Bundesrepublik Deutschland, West Germany. Since then, he lived in Frankfurt and, after some temporary jobs, became shipping clerk for a group of local newspapers. Due to the torture and mistreatment suffered during his imprisonment, Diamanski suffered from memory loss, unrest and panic attacks. On March 19, 1964, Diamanski was a witness during the first Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial. He gave witness in particular about Wilhelm Boger and the liquidation of the gypsy camp in Auschwitz. Although he said about Boger that he left him unharmed in Auschwitz due to their joint imprisonment in Berlin, he still incriminated Boger heavily.Hermann Langbein: People in Auschwitz, Published in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, University of North Carolina Press, 2004, , p.417  See also  This article is in part based on the same article on the German Wikipedia site, extended by using additional independent references, especially Heiko Haumann's book Hermann Diamanski: √úberleben in der Katastrophe: Eine deutsche Geschichte zwischen Auschwitz und Staatssicherheitsdienst (1910-1976).

Over time, the use of clearinghouses such as ICE Trust [ICE Clear Credit LLC since July 16, 2011] is expected to reduce the volume of settlement payments among members of the clearinghouse and, in theory, reduce counterparty credit risks that arise under CDS. However, trading CDS through clearinghouses may not effectively address concentration risk given that, at least initially, the clearinghouse members will be the major dealers currently involved in most trades. In order to address counterparty risk, members must provide collateral to ICE Trust [ICE Clear Credit LLC since July 16, 2011] to cover their obligations under cleared CDS. Members must also make initial and ongoing contributions to a guaranty fund that can be used by ICE Trust in the event of a member default (Forrester et al 2009).\\" ICE Clear Credit LLC is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) and by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a Securities Clearing Agency (SCA).

History In 2009 ICE Trust became a New York chartered bank for purposes of Federal Reserve Act and was therefore eligible for membership in the Federal Reserve System. By 2010, Intercontinental Exchange had cleared more than $10 trillion in credit default swaps (CDS) (Terhune Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29) through its subsidiaries, ICE Trust CDS (now ICE Clear Credit) in March 2009 and at ICE Clear Europe in July 2009 in New York, launched in 2008, (which also handles soft commodity futures/options) and ICE Clear Europe Limited in London, UK, launched in July 2009, (which also trades in energy futures) clearing entities for credit default swaps (CDS)(Terhune Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29). Intercontinental Exchange's closest rival as credit default swaps (CDS) clearing houses, CME Group (CME) cleared $192 million in comparison to ICE's $10 trillion (Terhune Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29). (CME Group comprises the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange and New York Commodities Exchange). Bloomberg's Terhune (2010) explained how investors seeking high- margin returns use Credit Default Swaps (CDS) to bet against financial instruments owned by other companies and countries. Intercontinental's clearing houses guarantee every transaction between buyer and seller providing a much-needed safety net reducing the impact of a default by spreading the risk. ICE collects on every trade.(Terhune Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29). Brookings senior research fellow, Robert E. Litan, cautioned however, \\"valuable pricing data will not be fully reported, leaving ICE's institutional partners with a huge informational advantage over other traders. He calls ICE Trust [now ICE Clear Credit] \\"a derivatives dealers' club\\" in which members make money at the expense of nonmembers (Terhune citing Litan in Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29). (Litan Derivatives Dealers‚Äô Club 2010).\\" Actually, Litan conceded that \\"some limited progress toward central clearing of CDS has been made in recent months, with CDS contracts between dealers now being cleared centrally primarily through one clearinghouse (ICE Trust) [ICE Trust [now ICE Clear Credit] in which the dealers have a significant financial interest (Litan 2010:6).\\" However, \\"as long as ICE Trust [now ICE Clear Credit] has a monopoly in clearing, watch for the dealers to limit the expansion of the products that are centrally cleared, and to create barriers to electronic trading and smaller dealers making competitive markets in cleared products (Litan 2010:8).\\" The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted an exemption for IntercontinentalExchange to begin guaranteeing credit-default swaps. The SEC exemption represented the last regulatory approval needed by Atlanta-based Intercontinental. Its larger competitor, CME Group Inc., hasn‚Äôt received an SEC exemption, and agency spokesman John Nester said he didn‚Äôt know when a decision would be made. On March 4, 2009, ICE announced that ICE US Trust, LLC (ICE Trust), a New York limited liability trust company, received regulatory approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to become a member of the Federal Reserve System and to serve as a clearing house and central counterparty for credit default swap (CDS) transactions, initially for North American CDS indexes and later adding liquid single-name swaps. Now known as ICE Clear Credit LLC it is subject to direct regulation and supervision by the CFTC and the SEC. Also in March 2009 ICE acquired The Clearing Corporation (TCC). This acquisition provided the risk management framework, operational processing and clearing infrastructure for CDS clearing. ICE paid TCC's cash on hand at the close, $39 million more in cash and gave profit participation of less than 35% of the total to be paid to the 10 initial clearing members of TCC. ICE Clear Credit LLC received temporary no-action assurances from CFTC to exempt ICE swap market participants from various requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), that would otherwise apply to certain swap transactions as a result Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The exemption was based on the premise that the Dodd-Frank Act reflected an \\"underlying policy to facilitate the central clearing of CDS transactions to reduce systemic risk in the global financial markets, while also minimizing unnecessary disruption and costs to the markets.\\" In an article published in the New York Times (December 11, 2010) Louise Story argued that members of ICE Clear Credit LLC powerful risk committee drawn from banks like Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, \\"helps oversee trading in derivatives ... [and also] share a common goal: to protect the interests of big banks in the vast market for derivatives, one of the most profitable ‚Äî and controversial ‚Äî fields in finance,\\" a system with \\"costly implications\\" for customers and smaller banks. \\"The marketplace as it functions now 'adds up to higher costs to all Americans,' said Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates most derivatives. More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he said.\\" In the same month, ICE said it was \\"well positioned\\" to establish a Swap Execution Facility (SEF), having met with Commissioner Gensler or his staff four times in the past year to discuss SEF registration. An SEF or multiple SEFs will be the derivatives-trading platform(s) newly required under Dodd-Frank financial-markets reform.

Cupio dissolvi is a Latin locution used in the Vulgate translation of the Paul's epistle to Philippians . The phrase, literally meaning \\"I wish to be dissolved\\", expresses the Christian desire to leave the earthly life and join Christ in eternal life. It has played an important role in discussions on the topic of suicide from the Middle Ages to the early Modern period. Over time, however, especially where national idioms derive from Romance languages, the phrase has acquired more secular and profane meanings and uses, expressing such concepts as the rejection of existence and the masochistic desire for self-destruction. Quote and interpretation The Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible translates: The phrase occurs in one of Paul's ecstasies, the loosening of the soul from the body being a prerequisite to joining Christ. A traditional use is found, for instance, in The Seven Modes of Sacred Love, by Brabantian mystic Beatrice of Nazareth (1200‚Äì1268): a complete release of the soul into eternal love. A similar use is found in a twelfth-century Old English homily on St. James from Trinity College, Cambridge, MS.B.14.52: \\"Hateful to me is this earthly life, and I long for Christ\\". For medieval theologians, the concept was unproblematic; Rabanus Maurus (780-856) clarifies that this desire is an example of an acceptable cupiditas or greed. Not until the eleventh century is a note of warning struck, by Peter Lombard (1096‚Äì1164): it does not mean that one should only tolerate earthly life instead of loving it, suggesting that the locution had been read to mean that hastening one's end is preferable over living out one's life (as a notion deriving from Seneca, for instance), a misreading offered in Hildebert's Querimonia. Michel de Montaigne (1533‚Äì1592) and contemporary theologians read the phrase also as \\"giv[ing] the lie to those who say that the desire to die means sinful despair\\"; cupio dissolvi is a frequently cited locution in the ongoing discussion on suicide, which often took the semi-Platonic character of the reputed suicide Cleombrotus of Ambracia as a case study. =Among English authors= The locution is cited in important texts from all stages of the English language. In the Old English homily of Trinity MS.B.14.52, it occurs in Latin (spelled \\"cupio dissolui\\") surrounded by Old English prose. In Middle English, it occurs for instance in the Lambeth Homilies, translated as \\"ich walde thet ich ded were, for me longeth to criste.\\" It was frequently quoted by Thomas More (1478‚Äì1535) especially as he got older, and by John Donne (1572‚Äì1631) in many of his sermons. Wider meaning In Donne, the use of this phrase is taken as indicative of the strength of his \\"desire to believe himself among God's elect\\", while, for the exegesis influenced by Freud, of his being \\"possessed not only by the 'death wish' but also by a lifetime's struggle against it that this consideration should powerfully, even finally, determine our sense of the overall direction and significance of his work.\\" The Latin biblical locution occurs in alchemist Heinrich Khunrath's Von hylealischen [...] Chaos, 1597, p. 204 (205?). Carl Jung, founder of the analytical psychology, quoted him to describe the process of dream interpretation and individuation: \\"Soul and spirit must be separated from the body, and this is equivalent to death: 'Therefore Paul of Tarsus saith, Cupio dissolvi, et esse cum Christo'.\\" The cultural theorist Dominic Pettman explained the twentieth century and the postmodern contemporary society, swung violently between the poles of anticipation and anticlimax, citing a statement expressed by Mario Praz in 1930: Citing Translation of  See also  * Death drive * List of Latin phrases  References   External links  * New Testament Latin words and phrases Vulgate Latin words and phrases Christian terminology ","title":"Cupio dissolvi"},{"id":"36504627","text":"Areum may refer to: * Areum (name) * Areum-dong ","title":"Areum"},{"id":"36504659","text":"The VL85 () is a Soviet (and later Russian) built electric mainline freight locomotive manufactured at the Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant (NEVZ) and designed under the management of V.Ya.Sverdlov (ru:–í.–Ø.–°–≤–µ—Ä–¥–ª–æ–≤).

All VL85 locomotives operate on the East- Siberian Railway and the Krasnoyarsk Railway, from depots at Ilanskaya, Taishet, Nizhneudinsk, and Ulan-Ude. Technical Characteristics The VL85 is twin-section electric locomotive consisting of two identical units, resting on three two axle bogies, and powered by twelve NB-514 traction motors delivering a continuous output of . The VL85 operates on single-phase alternating current. The locomotives are equipped for regenerative braking and are designed to operate in temperatures from , and at altitudes up to . The minimum radius of curvature it can negotiate is . Total weight is . Traction and braking forces are transmitted to the body via inclined rods. The end bogies on each unit have a cradle suspension, while the center bogie has a set of swinging compressed elastic rods to allow for lateral movement through curves. To provide current collection there is a pantograph above each cab of the locomotive. Each unit has a 7,100 kVA traction transformer, model ONDTSE-10000/25-82UHL2. Each transformer has a high voltage winding and three traction windings. Each section also has three VIP-4000 rectifiers. Each is powered by its own traction winding and provides power to two parallel connected traction motors on a bogie. These rectifiers use thyristor control and also convert power back to alternating current during regenerative braking. The first two prototypes used the same NB-418K6 traction motors as the VL80 series. Production units use the NB-514 model. Improvements in the aerodynamics of the ventilation ducts reduced the number of cooling fans for this motor by half. A new feature of the cab is a single large control panel in the center, replacing separate panels for the driver and assistant. In service these locomotives are nicknamed 'Ox' because of their size. Despite the theoretically greater adhesion that should be provided by the new suspension system (the point of transfer is below the axles) these units are noted as being slightly less 'grippy' than their VL80R predecessor, possibly due to difficulty in attaining perfect weight distribution across the three bogies.

() is a 1991 book by the philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the psychoanalyst F√©lix Guattari. The two had met shortly after May 1968 when they were in their forties and collaborated most notably on Capitalism & Schizophrenia (Volume 1: Anti-Oedipus (1972); Volume 2: A Thousand Plateaus 1980) and Kafka: Towards a Minority Literature (1975). In this, the last book they co-signed, philosophy, science, and art are treated as three modes of thought. Background and concepts Deleuze commented in a letter to one of his translators that his purpose in writing What is Philosophy? was to address \\"the problem of absolute immanence\\" and to explain why he considered Baruch Spinoza the \\"prince of philosophers.\\" What is Philosophy? is concerned with, among the concepts that the book explores, the plane of immanence, conceptual personae, geophilosophy, functives, prospects, affects, percepts and chaos, as well as concepts in themselves understood as basic components of philosophy. In a review of the translation of Fran√ßois Dosse's biography of Deleuze & Guattari, Adam Shatz writes that while it was Deleuze alone who wrote their final collaboration, the ideas of his longtime friend were still very much present in this \\"uncharacteristically sombre and subdued[,]\\" but \\"lyrical\\" book. Mathias Sch√∂nher holds that What is Philosophy? is Deleuze and Guattari's last book jointly written. As evidence he cites the drafts and working notes from the Guattari Collection at the archives of the Institute for Contemporary Publishing Archives (IMEC). Reception =Mainstream media= What is Philosophy? received a mixed review from Leon H. Brody in Library Journal. The book was also reviewed by John Rajchman in Artforum, Christopher Stanley in The Times Higher Education Supplement, and the philosopher Paul R. Patton in The Times Literary Supplement, and discussed by Adam Shatz in a review of a biography of the two men. Brody credited Deleuze and Guattari with \\"singular insights\\" into the nature of philosophy and the distinction between it and other disciplines, but believed that because of the way the book was written it was unclear whether their conclusions were correct or their views were fully intelligible. =Academic reception= What is Philosophy? was reviewed by M. R. Loudon in the British Journal of Educational Studies. Other discussions include those by Stephen Arnott in Philosophy Today, Isabelle Stengers in Angelaki, Vikki Bell in Theory, Culture & Society, Hanneke Grottenboer in Oxford Art Journal, Daniel W. Smith in Parallax, Ted Striphas in Text and Performance Quarterly, David R. Cole in Educational Philosophy & Theory, Henning Schmidgen in Theory, Culture & Society, and Mathias Sch√∂nher in Theory, Culture & Society. Stuhr, writing in The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, described the book as important, highly original, and challenging. He praised Deleuze and Guattari's discussions of the nature of concepts and the relationship of philosophy to science and art. Plotnitsky defended the book against criticism from Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont in Paragraph. Smith wrote that Deleuze and Guattari's definition of philosophy was famous. Schmidgen argued that philosophy and science did not have such clearly distinct purposes as Deleuze and Guattari maintained. =Criticism= In a chapter of Fashionable Nonsense, Sokal and Bricmont object to the use of scientific terms such as \\"chaos\\" in meaningless or misleading ways. They list a number of occurrences of what they deem to be \\"pseudo-scientific language\\".

The eighth named storm and third typhoon in the 2012 Pacific typhoon season, Vicente began life as a tropical depression on July 18, 2012 north east of the Philippines. Vicente soon steadily moved into the South China Sea, and began to intensify above warm sea waters, and began explosive intensification early on July 23, and started to charge toward the Guangdong region prompting the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) to issue the Hurricane Signal, No. 10, the first since York in 1999. The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau also hoisted the Signal No. 9 for the first time since York and after the transfer of sovereignty over Macau. Late on the same day, Vicente made landfall over Taishan in Guangdong, China. Meteorological history After Khanun became a tropical storm on July 16, its large area of convection associated with a tropical wave in the south began to split, and it was transformed into a tropical disturbance on July 17.Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression on July 18. On July 20, the tropical depression became more organized; however, due to moderate vertical wind shear, and dry air coming from the north of the system, the low level circulation center became exposed, as it developed three multiple circulation centers. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system; soon, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Ferdie. The JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression late on the same day. After the system moved into the South China Sea on July 21, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Vicente, while the storm moved out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility. As the system's convection began wrapping around the circulation center, the JTWC upgraded Vicente to a tropical storm late on July 21. On July 22, Vicente slowed down and looped, for the subtropical ridge northeast to the storm suddenly weakened. Late on the same day, the JMA upgraded Vicente to a severe tropical storm. On July 23, because of weak vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperature, Vicente's structure became better organized, and it started to form an eye when it moved towards Guangdong, China, prompting the JTWC upgrading Vicente to a category 1 typhoon. As system continued to strengthen, it developed a few Hot towers, reaching 9.3 miles (15 km) high. Soon after, Vicente began a phase of rapid intensification near the Pearl River Delta, leading the JTWC to amend their advisory at 12Z from a 70-knot (80.5 mph/129.6 kmh) category 1 typhoon to a 115-knot(132.3 mph/213 kmh) category 4 typhoon in six hours, and the JMA upgraded Vicente to a typhoon around the same time. When Vicente was located about 110 kilometres south- southwest of Hong Kong at 16:45 UTC on July 23, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued the Hurricane Signal, No. 10, the first since York in 1999 and the farthest from Hong Kong on record. Then, Typhoon Vicente made landfall over Taishan in Guangdong, China at 20:15 UTC, 111 kilometers west of Hong Kong, as a category 4 typhoon with winds of 213 km/h. On July 24, Vicente was still holding typhoon strength, even over land, as a category 3 typhoon, with winds of 185 kmh, and the JMA downgraded Vicente to a severe tropical storm. Later, the JMA downgraded Vicente to a tropical storm and even downgraded it to a tropical depression late on the same day. Preparations and impact =Philippines= The depression caused widespread rains and gusty winds in Luzon and Visayas region due to the enhancement of southwest monsoon. On July 20, classes were suspended from pre-school to high school level due to heavy rain and severe flooding. Some were stranded to their offices and residents were advised to seek in higher ground.Kids welcome class suspension, play in the rain, GMA News About eleven provinces in Luzon were hoisted the signal warnings as the depression crossed extreme northern Luzon. Rainfall exceeding 40 mm/h was recorded under the 400 diameter of the depression. On the same time, Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration released a red warning throughout Metro Manila and nearby provinces as the depression is expected to pour down a 3 - 4pm equivalent rainfall of Typhoon Ketsana of 2009. Classes in tertiary level were cancelled. Airports and seaports were advised to not engage with the weather as zero visibility in air and sea was expected. Gale warnings were also released.Tropical Depression Ferdie Soaks Luzon Stays in PH till Monday At least 2 people died and 6 others were officially missing.2 killed, 6 missing as floods hit Manila =Hong Kong= On July 21 at 15:40 Hong Kong Time (HKT) (07:40 UTC) after Tropical Depression 09W had come to within 800 km (500 mi) of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory, issued the Standby Signal Number 1 for the Special Administrative Region. The Standby Signal Number 1 was kept in force for the next 37 hours, before as Vicente started to move towards the Southern China coast, it was replaced with the Strong Wind Signal Number 3 at 05:20 HKT on July 23 (21:20 UTC, July 22). During that day, as the system moved closer to the Former British colony local winds gradually strengthened and reached gale force offshore and on high ground, before the HKO issued the Northeast Gale or Storm Signal Number 8 at 17:40 HKT (09:40 UTC). Local winds continued to strengthen after the Northeast Gale or Storm Signal No. 8 was issued with gales recorded generally in Hong Kong and were reaching storm force over waters in southern Hong Kong. The Increasing Gale or Storm Signal No. 9 was subsequently hoisted at 23:20 HKT (15:20 UTC), when Vicente was located about to the south-southwest of Hong Kong, and had just intensified abruptly into a severe typhoon. Fallen tree branches and debris in Sha Tin Park, near Sha Tin Centre, Hong Kong. During that night after Signal No. 9 had been issued, Vicente continued to move closer to Hong Kong and its eyewall came close to the south-western part of Hong Kong during the early hours. Local winds also turned and became southeasterly with storm force winds over many places of the Special Administrative Region, reaching hurricane force in the southwestern part of Hong Kong and on high ground. As a result, for the first time since Typhoon York in 1999, the HKO issued its highest TC warning signal: the Hurricane Signal Number 10 at 00:45 HKT (16:45 UTC). Typhoon Vicente's centre subsequently passed about to the southwest of the Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters between 01:00 ‚Äì 02:00 HKT (17:00 ‚Äì 18:00 UTC), which marked a direct hit and signifies that Vicente is the farthest TC that necessitated the issuance of Signal No. 10. The 10-minute wind speed of Cheung Chau automatic weather station peaked at 1:25am with a maximum of 140 km/h, proving that the highest TC warning signal was necessary. As Vicente moved away and local winds gradually subsided, the Southeast Gale or Storm Signal Number 8 was issued at 03:35 HKT (19:35 UTC) to replace Signal No. 10. The Southeast Gale or Storm Signal Number 8 was then replaced by the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10:10 HKT (02:10 UTC), which allowed business and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to reopen and trade again. The Signal No. 3 was replaced by Standby Signal No. 1 subsequently at 14:40 HKT (06:40 UTC). Vicente moved further away during the rest of the day and after its circulation was no longer affecting Hong Kong, all tropical cyclone warning signals were cancelled at 23:15 HKT (15:15 UTC). However, a monsoon trough continued to bring strong winds to Hong Kong, thus requiring the issuance of Strong Monsoon Signal immediately afterwards, until 5:20am on the next day. The weather in Hong Kong remained poor for 3 more days because of Vicente's outer rain bands and the monsoon trough. The Observatory had to issue the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal several times, until the weather became fine on 28 July. A fallen Leucaena leucocephala tree in Hong Kong, after being battered by Typhoon Vicente. During July 23 and 24, Typhoon Vicente's rainbands brought heavy squally showers to Hong Kong, during which over of rainfall was recorded over many parts of the territory, while a maximum storm surge of about was recorded at Tsim Bei Tsui. In Hong Kong, at least 138 people were injured during the passage of Vicente. The number of fallen trees amounted to about 8 800. There were two reports of landslip and 7 reports of flooding. Dangerous signboards or fallen scaffoldings were reported in many parts of the territory, resulting in closure of some roads and damage to many vehicles. A wooden board was blown up by strong winds in Connaught Road Central, hitting a number of passers-by and knocking one of them unconscious. During the storm, the East Rail line of the Mass Transit Railway had to halt service because of damage of overhead cables by toppling trees. As a result, hundreds of commuters were forced to spend the night in trains or at the MTR stations. Crops were damaged by flood waters in some farmlands in Sheung Shui. A small craft ran aground in Deep Water Bay and was damaged. At the Hong Kong International Airport, at least 90 flights were cancelled, over 446 flights delayed and 50 flights were diverted because of Typhoon Vicente on July 23‚Äì24. 8,800 trees were destroyed (which set a new record) and much debris crashed into downtown streets as people made their way home from work, being told to take shelter. Ferry, bus and train services were suspended or ran at reduced capacity. The ports and schools were closed, and at least 60 passenger flights were cancelled, while more than 270 flights were delayed. The stock exchange was also closed in the morning. Almost 140 injured people sought medical treatment and 268 people took refuge in storm shelters in Hong Kong. Hong Kong local media also reported that more than 100 people stayed in the Tai Wai train station overnight, unable to get home after services were suspended. There were no deaths. =Hong Kong plastic disaster= The Hong Kong plastic disaster resulted after seven containers fell overboard from a freighter in waters nearby and about 150 tons of plastic pellets drifted over the sea towards Macao or were washed ashore. =Macau= On July 21 at 18:00 Macao Standard Time (MST) (10:00 UTC) after Vicente had come to within of Macau, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, issued the Signal No.1 for the Special Administrative Region. Signal No.3 was hoisted at 6:30am on 23 July in response to the sudden turn of Vicente after a day of stalling. After Vicente intensified into a typhoon and moved further to the north, the Bureau hoisted Signal No. 8 NE at 7:00pm on the same day. Vicente posed a threat of direct hit with its northwest track, but the Bureau did not consider issuing higher signals until the next day. By then, storm-force winds were all over the region, with 10-minute sustained winds reaching hurricane on the 3 bridges. As Vicente started its direct hit on Macau, and the 3 bridges recorded hurricane, the Bureau finally announced at 1:12am on 24 July, that the bureau would switch for a higher signal in 2 to 3 hours. The Bureau hoisted the Signal No. 9 at 2:15am, which was the first one since Typhoon York in 1999, as well as the first issuance after the transfer of sovereignty over Macau. Vicente skirted at 40 km south-southwest of Macau at 3:00am, which marked the closest point of approach to the region, and proved that Vicente was closer to Macau than Hong Kong. Despite recording hurricane in the region, as well as Vicente being closer to Macau, Signal No. 10 was not hoisted, which led to controversy along with the late issuance of Signal No. 9. As Vicente made landfall at Taishan, Guangdong, Signal No. 9 lasted for less than 3 hours, and was changed to Signal No. 8 SE at 5:00am, which was subsequently switched to Signal No. 3 at 9:30am. All signals were lowered at 4:20pm on the same day. =China= Striking Guangdong Province as a severe typhoon, according to China Meteorological Agency, Vicente caused considerable damage in the region. Strong winds from the storm destroyed 500 homes and damaged 13,600 hectares (33,600 acres) of crops. Approximately 500,000 people were affected by the storm, of which 75,000 were evacuated and in need of assistance. In Shenzhen, high winds from the typhoon damaged about 115,000 trees, of which 30,000 were downed. Many of these fell on buildings and cars, causing additional damage. According to post-storm surveys, at least 2,770 cars were damaged or destroyed in the city, with losses amounting to ¬•13.2 million (US$2.1 million). Eight hundred properties reported storm-related damage with total losses exceeding CNY 50 million yuan (US$7.82 million). Throughout the province, three people were killed and economic losses reached ¬•1.08 billion (US$169 million). Although the storm had weakened considerably by the time it moved into Guangxi Province, heavy rains associated with it triggered damaging floods. A total of 1,886 homes were destroyed and 18,690 hectares (46,100 acres) of crops were damaged. Losses throughout the province reached ¬•92.1 million (US$14.4 million). In neighboring Guizhou Province heavy rains exacerbated ongoing floods and resulted in four fatalities. More than 400 homes were destroyed, 17,800 hectares (44,000 acres) of crops were damaged, and economic losses reached CNY 130 million (US$20.3 million). In all, 11 people were killed in China, and the total economic losses were counted to be ¬•2.05 billion (US$321 million). =Vietnam= The remnants of Typhoon Vicente moved into northeastern Vietnam and caused heavy rain within the area, with various areas recording storm rainfall totals off between . This resulted in landslides and significant flash floods within the Red and Thai Binh rivers and landslides. Throughout the country, 21 people were killed and 15 others were left injured. 342 homes were destroyed and 10,436 homes were partially damaged. Total damage were amounted to be 642 billion ƒë·ªìng (US$29.9 million).

Sixty thousand people marched chanting \\"Sayonara nuclear power\\" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon nuclear power, following the Fukushima disaster. Long one of the world's most committed promoters of civilian nuclear power, Japan's nuclear industry was not hit as hard by the effects of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident (USA) or the 1986 Chernobyl disaster (USSR) as some other countries. Construction of new plants continued to be strong through the 1980s and into the 1990s. However, starting in the mid-1990s there were several nuclear related accidents and cover-ups in Japan that eroded public perception of the industry, resulting in protests and resistance to new plants. These accidents included the Tokaimura nuclear accident, the Mihama steam explosion, cover-ups after accidents at the Monju reactor, and the 21 month shut down of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant following an earthquake in 2007. Because of these events, Japan's nuclear industry has been scrutinized by the general public of the country. The negative impact of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has changed attitudes in Japan. Political and energy experts describe \\"nothing short of a nationwide loss of faith, not only in Japan‚Äôs once-vaunted nuclear technology but also in the government, which many blame for allowing the accident to happen\\". Sixty thousand people marched in central Tokyo on 19 September 2011, chanting \\"Say≈çnara nuclear power\\" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon nuclear power, following the Fukushima disaster. Bishop of Osaka, Michael Goro Matsuura, has called on the solidarity of Christians worldwide to support this anti-nuclear campaign. In July 2012, 75,000 people gathered near in Tokyo for the capital's largest anti-nuclear event yet. Organizers and participants said such demonstrations signal a fundamental change in attitudes in a nation where relatively few have been willing to engage in political protests since the 1960s. Anti-nuclear groups include the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, Stop Rokkasho, Hidankyo, Sayonara Nuclear Power Plants, Women from Fukushima Against Nukes, and the Article 9 group. People associated with the anti-nuclear movement include: Jinzaburo Takagi, Haruki Murakami, Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, Nobuto Hosaka, Mizuho Fukushima, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Tetsunari Iida. As of September 2012, most Japanese people support the zero option on nuclear power, and Prime Minister Yoshihiko and the Japanese government announced a dramatic change of direction in energy policy, promising to make the country nuclear-free by the 2030s. There will be no new construction of nuclear power plants, a 40-year lifetime limit on existing nuclear plants, and any further nuclear plant restarts will need to meet tough safety standards of the new independent regulatory authority. The new approach to meeting energy needs will also involve investing $500 billion over 20 years to commercialize the use of renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power. The current Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe, who was elected in 2012, has put nuclear energy back on the political agenda, with plans to restart as many reactors as possible. In July 2015, the government submitted its ideas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations, and the proposal included a target for nuclear power to meet at least 20% of Japan's electricity consumption by 2030. Renewable energy sources, such as hydropower but also solar power, would contribute 22% or more. On 11 August 2015, the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant broke a four-year lull when it restarted one of its reactors. The restart is the first since Japan's nuclear power industry collapsed, following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster.Davide Castelvecchi, \\"Japan‚Äôs nuclear revival won‚Äôt lower carbon emissions enough\\", Nature, 11 August 2015. As of March 10, 2020, out of Japan‚Äôs 56 nuclear reactors, 24 are due to be decommissioned, 9 are currently working and 7 are ready to be restarted. 3 new reactors are under construction, in order to meet Japan's Fifth Energy Basic Plan (20%‚Äì22% nuclear energy by 2030). History The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, a nuclear plant with seven units, the largest single nuclear power station in the world, was completely shut down for 21 months following an earthquake in 2007.The European Parliament's Greens-EFA Group - The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2007 p. 23. The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident since 1986, displaced 50,000 households after radiation leaked into the air, soil and sea. Radiation checks led to bans of some shipments of vegetables and fish. The use of nuclear power (in yellow) in Japan declined significantly after the Fukushima accident The first nuclear reactor in Japan was built by the United Kingdom's GEC. In the 1970s, the first light water reactors were built in cooperation with American companies. Robert Jay Lifton has asked how Japan, after its experience with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, could \\"allow itself to draw so heavily on the same nuclear technology for the manufacture of about a third of its energy\\". He says: > There was resistance, much of it from Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. But > there was also a pattern of denial, cover-up and cozy bureaucratic collusion > between industry and government, the last especially notorious in Japan but > by no means limited to that country. Even then, pro-nuclear power forces > could prevail only by managing to instill in the minds of Japanese people a > dichotomy between the physics of nuclear power and that of nuclear weapons, > an illusory distinction made not only in Japan but throughout the world. Japan's nuclear industry was not hit as hard by the effects of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident (USA) or the 1986 Chernobyl disaster (USSR) as some other countries. Construction of new plants continued to be strong through the 1980s and into the 1990s. However, starting in the mid-1990s there were several nuclear related accidents and cover-ups in Japan that eroded public perception of the industry, resulting in protests and resistance to new plants. These accidents included the Tokaimura nuclear accident, the Mihama steam explosion, and cover-ups after an accidents at the Monju reactor. More citizens subsequently became concerned about potential health impacts, the absence of a long-term nuclear waste storage facility, and nuclear weapons proliferation. The more recent Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant was completely shut down for 21 months following an earthquake in 2007. While exact details may be in dispute, it is clear that the safety culture in Japan's nuclear industry came under greater scrutiny. Research results show that some 95 post-war attempts to site and build nuclear power plants resulted in only 54 completions. Many affected communities \\"fought back in highly publicized battles\\". Co-ordinated opposition groups, such as the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center and the anti-nuclear newspaper Hangenpatsu Shinbun have operated since the early 1980s. Cancelled plant orders included: *The Maki NPP at Maki, Niigata (Kambara)‚ÄîCanceled in 2003 *The Kushima NPP at Kushima, Miyazaki‚Äî1997 *The Ashihama NPP at Ashihama, Mie Prefecture‚Äî2000 (the first Project at the site in the 1970s where realized at Hamaoka as Unit 1&2) *The H≈çhoku NPP at H≈çhoku, Yamaguchi‚Äî1994 *The Suzu NPP at Suzu, Ishikawa‚Äî2003 Genpatsu-shinsai, meaning nuclear power plant earthquake disaster is a term which was coined by Japanese seismologist Professor Katsuhiko Ishibashi in 1997.Genpatsu-Shinsai: Catastrophic Multiple Disaster of Earthquake and Quake- induced Nuclear Accident Anticipated in the Japanese Islands (Slides), Katsuhiko Ishibashi, 23rd. General Assembly of IUGG, 2003, Sapporo, Japan, accessed 2011-03-28 It describes a domino effect scenario in which a major earthquake causes a severe accident at a nuclear power plant near a major population centre, resulting in an uncontrollable release of radiation in which the radiation levels make damage control and rescue impossible, and earthquake damage severely impedes the evacuation of the population. Ishibashi envisages that such an event would have a global impact and a 'fatal' effect on Japan, seriously affecting future generations.Genpatsu-Shinsai: Catastrophic Multiple Disaster of Earthquake and Quake-induced Nuclear Accident Anticipated in the Japanese Islands (Abstract), Katsuhiko Ishibashi, 23rd. General Assembly of IUGG, 2003, Sapporo, Japan, accessed 2011-03-28 Groups The Citizens' Nuclear Information Center is an anti-nuclear public interest organization dedicated to securing a nuclear-free world. It was established in Tokyo in 1975 to collect and analyze information related to nuclear power, including safety, economic, and proliferation issues. Data compiled by the CNIC is presented to the media, citizens' groups and policy makers. The CNIC is independent from government and industry.Introducing CNIC In 1995, Jinzaburo Takagi, the late former director of the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, \\"warned about the dangers posed by the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Station and other old atomic plants\\", and also \\"cautioned the government and utilities about their policy of not assessing the safety risks for nuclear power stations beyond their assumed scenarios\\". No Nukes Plaza Tokyo was established in 1989, after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, and is one of the oldest groups opposing nuclear power in Japan. Green Action Japan is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that was established in 1991 and works to create a nuclear-power-free Japan. In May 2006, an international awareness campaign about the dangers of the Rokkasho reprocessing plant, Stop Rokkasho,Stop Rokkasho was launched by musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. Greenpeace has also opposed the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant under a campaign called \\"Wings of Peace ‚Äì No more Hiroshima Nagasaki\\",Wings of Peace ‚Äì No more Hiroshima Nagasaki since 2002 and has launched a cyberaction to stop the project. In 2008, members of hundreds of opposition groups demonstrated in central Tokyo to protest the building of the Rokkasho Plant, designed to allow commercial reprocessing of reactor waste to produce plutonium. In July 2011, the Hidankyo, the group representing the 10,000 or so survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan, called for the first time for the elimination of civilian nuclear power. In its action plan for 2012, the group appealed for \\"halting construction of new nuclear plants and the gradual phasing out of Japan‚Äôs 54 current reactors as energy alternatives are found\\". The movement of \\"Women from Fukushima Against Nukes\\" (Genptasu iranai Fukushima kara no onnatachi) expresses views against nuclear power. Women's groups have been critical of the government's handling of the Fukushima aftermath‚Äîthey object to the raising of the allowed radiation exposure rate from 1 to 20 mSv, poor identification of radiation \\"hotspots\\", calculation only of external radiation while omitting internal radiation, and patchy food supply arrangements. Fukushima has also highlighted earlier research showing a much greater risk of radiation-induced cancer for women and children. The women say the government should evacuate children from areas with consistently elevated radiation levels. Hundreds of women, from Fukushima and elsewhere, organized a sit-in protest at the Ministry of Economy headquarters from October 30 to November 5. Women have helped to follow through on the September 19 Tokyo protest where 60,000 marched. Some women have long participated in protest against the Fukushima TEPCO nuclear plants, but there were also many newcomers. Now, in the wake of March 11, 2011, they are airing their views nationwide. Greenpeace has reported on their activities in a blog entry. The founders of the Article 9 group advocate the removal of nuclear power from the nation's energy policy in light of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution and the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Article 9 says that Japan forever renounces war, stating, \\"Land, sea and air forces as well as other war potential will never be maintained.\\" Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, one of the nine founders of the Article 9 Association, spoke at the group's national rally in Tokyo in November 2011, which drew about 700 people. The Sayonara Nuclear Power Plants group will deliver the petition to local governments hosting nuclear plants or located near them to help pursue a society independent of nuclear energy. The group says it has many supporters, including Minamisoma Mayor Katsunobu Sakurai in Fukushima Prefecture and Tokai Village Mayor Tatsuya Murakami in Ibaraki Prefecture, in addition to film director Yoji Yamada, actress Sayuri Yoshinaga and other high-profile personalities. The group will hold a rally in Koriyama, Fukushima, on March 11, the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and a rally in Tokyo on July 16, which the group hopes will draw 100,000 people. The National Network of Parents to Protect Children from Radiation is a Japanese anti- nuclear organization with over 275 member organizations from Hokkaido to Okinawa. Mainly made up of mothers, the Tokyo area has the most groups, followed by the Osaka/Kyoto region and then the prefectures near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Michael Banach, the Vatican representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told a conference in Vienna in September 2011 that the Japanese nuclear disaster created new concerns about the safety of nuclear plants globally. Auxiliary bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said this serious nuclear power incident should be a lesson for Japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects. He called on the worldwide Christian solidarity to provide wide support for this anti-nuclear campaign. Statements from bishops‚Äô conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power. Columban priest Fr Se√°n McDonagh's forthcoming book is entitled Is Fukushima the Death Knell for Nuclear Energy?. Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe has said Japan should decide quickly to abandon its nuclear reactors. The National Confederation of Trade Unions, which has about 1.14 million members, wants nuclear power to be eliminated and its members have attended protests at the prime minister's office. Campaigns Kaminoseki NPP in Kaminoseki, Yamaguchi. The proposed Kaminoseki Nuclear Power Plant is to be built on landfill in a national park in Japan's well-known and picturesque Seto Inland Sea. For three decades, local residents, fishermen, and environmental activists have opposed the plant. The Inland Sea has been the site of intense seismic activity, yet the utility involved continues with its plans. In January 2011, five Japanese young people held a hunger strike for more than a week, outside the Prefectural Government offices in Yamaguchi City, to protest site preparation for the planned Kaminoseki plant. The possibility of a magnitude 8-plus earthquake in the Tokai region near the Hamaoka plant was \\"brought to the public's attention by geologist Ishibashi Katsuhiko in the 1970s\\". On 10 April 2011 protesters called for the Hamaoka nuclear-power plant to be shut down.\\"Thousands Protest Nuclear Power in Japan\\" On 6 May 2011, Prime Minister Naoto Kan ordered the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant be shut down as an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 or higher is likely to hit the area within the next 30 years.Story at BBC News, 2011-05-06. retrieved 2011-05-08Story at Digital Journal. retrieved 2011-05-07Story at Bloomberg, 2011-05-07. retrieved 2011-05-08] Kan wanted to avoid a possible repeat of the Fukushima disaster. On 9 May 2011, Chubu Electric decided to comply with the government request. Kan later called for a new energy policy with less reliance on nuclear power. In July 2011, a mayor in Shizuoka Prefecture and a group of residents filed a lawsuit seeking the permanent decommissioning of the reactors at the Hamaoka nuclear power plant. In 1982, Chugoku Electric Power Company proposed building a nuclear power plant near Iwaishima, but many residents opposed the idea, and the island's fishing cooperative voted overwhelmingly against the plans. In January 1983, almost 400 islanders staged a protest march, which was the first of more than 1,000 protests the islanders conducted. Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011 there has been wider opposition to construction plans for the plant. Protests Public opposition to nuclear power existed in Japan before the Fukushima disaster. But it was not as strong and visible as it has been post-Fukushima, when demonstrators turned to the streets in the thousands to protest the use of nuclear power. Worldwide, the traumatic events in Japan in 2011 revitalised the anti-nuclear movement. On January 27, 2008, Consumers Union of Japan together with 596 organisations and groups, including fishery associations, consumer cooperatives and surfer groups, participated in a parade in central Tokyo against the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.http://www.nishoren.org/en/?p=35 The next day, over 810,000 signatures had been collected and were handed in by representatives to the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. =2011= Anti nuclear rally in Tokyo on Sunday 27 March 2011.

Peaceful anti-nuclear protest in Tokyo, Japan, escorted by policemen, 16 April 2011. Anti-Nuclear Power Plant Rally on 19 September 2011 at Meiji Shrine Outer Garden Several large protests occurred on April 10, 2011, a month following 3.11: 15,000 people marched in a \\"sound demonstration\\" organized by Shir≈çto no Ran (Revolt of the Laymen), a used-goods shop in K≈çenji, Tokyo, while thousands also marched in Shiba Park, Tokyo and other locations. One protester, Yohei Nakamura, said nuclear power is a serious problem and that anti-nuclear demonstrations were undercovered in the Japanese press because of the influence of TEPCO.\\" Three months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters marched in Japan. Company workers, students, and parents with children rallied across Japan, \\"venting their anger at the government's handling of the crisis, carrying flags bearing the words 'No Nukes!' and 'No More Fukushima'.\\" In August 2011, about 2,500 people including farmers and fishermen marched in Tokyo. They have incurred heavy losses following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and called for prompt compensation from plant operator TEPCO and the government. In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, marching to the beat of drums, \\"took to the streets of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March earthquake and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant\\". Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward renewable energy sources. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike in an effort to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy. Sixty thousand people marched in central Tokyo on 19 September 2011, chanting \\"Sayonara nuclear power\\" and waving banners, to call on Japan's government to abandon nuclear power, following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Author Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe and musician Ryuichi Sakamoto were among the event's supporters. These were the largest set of demonstrations in Japan since the US-Japan security treaty protests of the 1960s and 1970s. Female protest leaders helped to maintain the momentum of the September 19 protest in Tokyo. Hundreds of women, many of them from Fukushima, organized a sit-in protest at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry from October 30-November 5. Women's groups have been particularly scathing and effective in condemning the government's casualization of radiation exposure ‚Äì \\"the increase of the permissible exposure rate from 1 to 20 mSv, its inadequate attention to \\"hotspots\\" outside of the official evacuation areas, its calculation only of external radiation while ignoring internal radiation, and its spotty food supply oversight\\". More than 1,000 people formed a candle- lit human chain around Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry on the evening November 11, 2011, the eight-month anniversary of the Fukushima crisis. On November 18 at the site of another nuclear power plant on the southern island of Kyushu, some 15,000 people demonstrated to call on the government to abandon all of the nation's reactors. People have also been protesting in other parts of the country. =2012= Thousands of demonstrators marched in Yokohama on the weekend of January 14‚Äì15, 2012, to show their support for a nuclear power-free world. The demonstration showed that organized opposition to nuclear power has gained momentum in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The most immediate demand was for the protection of basic human rights for those affected by the Fukushima accident. On the 2012 anniversary of the 11 March earthquake and tsunami all over Japan protesters called for the abolishing of nuclear power, and the scrapping of nuclear reactors. * Tokyo: a 15,000-strong demonstration was held in the Ginza and the Kasumigaseki districts of Tokyo, marching by TEPCO headquarters and ending with a human chain around the Diet Building. * Koriyama, Fukushima: 16,000 people were at a meeting, they walked through the city calling for the end of nuclear power. * Shizuoka Prefecture: 1,100 people called for the scrapping of the Hamaoka reactors of Chubu Electric Power Co.. * Tsuruga, Fukui: 1,200 people marched in the streets of the city of Tsuruga, the home of the Monju fast-breeder reactor prototype and the nuclear reactors of Kansai Electric Power Co. The crowd objected the restart of the reactors of the Oi-nuclear power plant. Of which NISA did approve the so-called stress-tests, after the reactors were taken out of service for a regular check-up. * Saga city, Aomori city: Likewise protests were held in the cities of Saga and Aomori and at various other places hosting nuclear facilities. * Nagasaki and Hiroshima: Anti-nuclear protesters and atomic-bomb survivors marched together and demanded that Japan should end its dependency on nuclear power.The Mainichi Shimbun (12 March 2012) Antinuclear protests held across Japan on anniversary of disaster By March 2012, one year after the Fukushima disaster, all but two of Japan's nuclear reactors had been shut down; some were damaged by the quake and tsunami. Authority to restart the others after scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments, and in all cases local opposition prevented restarting. According to The Japan Times, the Fukushima nuclear disaster changed the national debate over energy policy almost overnight. \\"By shattering the government's long-pitched safety myth about nuclear power, the crisis dramatically raised public awareness about energy use and sparked strong anti-nuclear sentiment\\". In June 2012, a Pew Research Center poll showed 70% of Japanese surveyed wanted nuclear power use reduced or eliminated. It also found 80% distrustful of the government's ability to properly manage the safety and environmental issues associated with the nuclear industry. Meanwhile, protests every Friday had begun in front of the prime minister's residence (kanteimae) in late March 2012 ; between late June and early August, about 150,000-200,000 gathered every week. 170,000 gathered in Yoyogi park for a Sayonara-Genpatsu demonstration in mid-July 2012, while about 200,000 marched around the government district and surrounded the Diet on July 29, 2012. Organizers and participants said recent demonstrations signal a fundamental change in attitudes in a nation where relatively few have been willing to engage in political protests since the 1960s. Groups and activists websites, such as the Frying Dutchman'sFrying Dutchman (more than 1 million views) gathered notable audience. In July 2012, Ryuichi Sakamoto organized a concert entitled \\"No Nukes 2012,\\" featuring performances by 18 groups including Yellow Magic Orchestra, Kraftwerk, Asian Kung-Fu Generation, Saito Kazuyoshi, Akihiro Namba, and others. The concert attracted 17,000 people over two days; its U-Stream simulcast was accessed 542,000 times. These protests against nuclear power were never as large as the anti-nuclear weapons protests in 1982 in Hiroshima (200,000) and Tokyo (400,000). As of September 2012, most Japanese people supported the zero option on nuclear power, and Prime Minister Yoshihiko and the Japanese government announced a dramatic change of direction in energy policy, promising to make the country nuclear- free by the 2030s. There will be no new construction of nuclear power plants, a 40-year lifetime limit on existing nuclear plants, and any further nuclear plant restarts will need to meet tough safety standards of the new independent regulatory authority. The new approach to meeting energy needs will also involve investing $500 billion over 20 years to commercialize the use of renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power. =2013= On March 10, 2013, 40'000 protesters marched in Tokyo calling on the government to reject nuclear power.Thousands in Japan anti-nuclear protest two years after Fukushima Reuters More than 60,000 people marched on June 2 near the Diet building in Tokyo against the government's plan to restart nuclear power plants. Nobel laureate Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe attended the march. Marchers had gathered more than 8 million signatures in a petition against Japan's plan to restart nuclear power plants after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. People Mizuho Fukushima is the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, which has an anti-nuclear platform, and she has been referred to as a prominent anti-nuclear activist. For three decades, she was at the forefront of an often futile fight against the utilities that operated Japan's nuclear reactors, the corporations that built them and the bureaucrats who enabled them. That situation changed with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011. Kobayashi Yoshinori is an influential conservative who has criticized his pro- nuclear colleagues and supported the anti-nuclear movement. In August 2012 Kobayashi wrote a detailed assessment of the nuclear option and its problems. He argues that the risks of nuclear power are great and that the Fukushima nuclear disaster could have \\"cascaded out of control and left Tokyo uninhabitable\\". He compares TEPCOs actions to the Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas release in Tokyo's subways in 1995. The Sankei and Yomiuri newspapers are criticised for supporting nuclear power and he says nuclear power is just not necessary.Jeff Kingston, \\" Japan's Nuclear Village,\\" The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol. 10, Issue 37, No. 1, September 10, 2012. Jinzaburo Takagi was a Japanese assistant professor in nuclear chemistry. He wrote several books on environment protection, and on the nuclear wastethreat. He received the Yoko Tada Human Rights Award in 1992, and the Ihatobe Award in 1994. He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1997, jointly with Mycle Schneider. Koide Hiroaki began his career as a nuclear engineer forty years ago, when he believed that nuclear power was an important resource for the future. Quickly, however, he \\"recognized the flaws in Japan‚Äôs nuclear power program and emerged as among the best informed of Japan‚Äôs nuclear power critics\\". His most recent book, Genpatsu no uso (The Lie of Nuclear Power) became a bestseller in Japan. Award-winning novelist Haruki Murakami has said that the Fukushima accident was the second major nuclear disaster that the Japanese people have experienced, but this time it was not a bomb being dropped. According to Murakami, the Japanese people should have rejected nuclear power after having \\"learned through the sacrifice of the hibakusha just how badly radiation leaves scars on the world and human wellbeing\\". Nobel laureate Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe has been involved with pacifist and anti-nuclear campaigns and written books about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In September 2011, he urged Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to \\"halt plans to restart nuclear power plants and instead abandon nuclear energy\\". Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe said that Japan has an \\"ethical responsibility\\" to abandon nuclear power in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, just as the country renounced war under the postwar Constitution. During a 2012 press conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, ≈åe called for \\"an immediate end to nuclear power generation and warned that Japan would suffer another nuclear catastrophe if it tries to resume nuclear power plant operations\\". On March 12, 2011, after the Fukushima disaster, Naoto Kan flew in a helicopter to observe the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and was heavily involved in efforts to effectively respond to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.Yoshida, Reiji, \\"Kan hero, or irate meddler?\\", Japan Times, 17 March 2012, p. 2. Naoto Kan took an increasingly anti-nuclear stance in the months following the Fukushima disaster. In May, he ordered the aging Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and he said he would freeze plans to build new reactors. In July 2011, Kan said that Japan must reduce its dependence on nuclear energy, breaking with a decades-old Japanese government drive to build more nuclear power plants in the country. \\"We must scrap the plan to have nuclear power contribute 53 percent (of electricity supply) by 2030 and reduce the degree of reliance on nuclear power,\\" Kan told a government panel. Kan said Japan should abandon plans to build 14 new reactors by 2030. He wants to \\"pass a bill to promote renewable energy and questioned whether private companies should be running atomic plants\\". In 2012, Kan said the Fukushima disaster made it clear to him that \\"Japan needs to dramatically reduce its dependence on nuclear power, which supplied 30 percent of its electricity before the crisis, and has turned him into a believer of renewable energy\\". Kan announced his intention to resign on August 10, 2011. Nobuto Hosaka is the mayor of Setagaya, Tokyo. He campaigned and won the mayor's job on an anti-nuclear platform in April 2011, just over a month after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. According to The Wall Street Journal, Hosaka \\"is determined to turn this city ward of 840,000 people, the largest in Tokyo, into the front-runner of a movement that will put an end to Japan‚Äôs reliance on atomic power and accelerate the use of renewable energy\\". Tetsunari Iida is director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Japan. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, he is calling for a decrease in Japan's reliance on nuclear power and an increase in renewable energy use. Setsuko Thurlow, a survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing, has spoken about the Fukushima nuclear disaster and questioned the world's reliance on nuclear energy at a United Nations meeting in New York in 2011. Thurlow, who has become a strong advocate of nuclear non-proliferation, spoke at the meeting alongside Kazu Sueishi, another Hiroshima A-bomb hibakusha. Madarame Haruki, as Chairman of the Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission (2010-2012), was an ardent pro-nuclear advocate. However, his inquiry testimony in the Diet in February 2012, showed that he had become critical of the Commission's approach. He said that \\"Japan's atomic safety rules are inferior to global standards and left the country unprepared for the Fukushima nuclear disaster last March\\". There were flaws in, and lax enforcement of, the safety rules governing Japanese nuclear power companies, and this included insufficient protection against tsunamis. He said the nuclear power industry had strenuously opposed adopting stricter international safety standards. He spoke of officials ignoring nuclear risks and said, \\"We ended up wasting our time looking for excuses that these measures are not needed in Japan\\". Madarame also asserted that Japan's safety monitoring technology is outdated, while acknowledging that the Nuclear Safety Commission had, \\"‚Ä¶succumbed to a blind belief in the country‚Äôs technical prowess and failed to thoroughly assess the risks of building nuclear reactors in an earthquake-prone country\\". Regulators and the utilities missed many opportunities to improve operating safety standards and warned that safety regulations are fundamentally inadequate and minimally enforced. He also asserted that regulatory capture was an issue, where regulators had little power and were often subsumed by utility interests. In Madarame's view, there has been a collective heedlessness about safety and inadequate risk management.

Komekurayama Solar Power Plant owned and operated by TEPCO in Kofu, Yamanashi Prefecture Price of PV modules (yen/Wp) in Japan Solar power in Japan has been expanding since the late 1990s. The country is a leading manufacturer of solar panels and is in the top 5 ranking for countries with the most solar photovoltaics (PV) installed. In 2009 Japan had the third largest solar capacity in the world (behind Germany and Spain), with most of it grid connected.National survey report of PV Power applications in Japan 2006 retrieved 16 October 2008Global Market Outlook for photovoltaics until 2013 retrieved 22 May 2009 The solar insolation is good at about 4.3 to 4.8 kWh/(m¬≤¬∑day). Japan is the world's fourth largest energy consumer, making solar power an important national project. By the end of 2012, Japan had installed 7,000 MW of photovoltaics, enough to generate 0.77% of Japan's electricity. Due to the new feed-in tariff (FIT), Japan installed more than 5,000 MW in 2013.Japan set to top solar power market Retrieved 30 June 2013 The current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who came to power in 2012, has put nuclear energy back on the political agenda, with plans to restart as many reactors as possible. In July 2015, the government submitted its ideas for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to the United Nations, and the proposal included a target for nuclear power to meet at least 20% of Japan's electricity consumption by 2030. Renewable energy sources, such as hydropower and solar power, would contribute more than 22%.

Portrait of Antoine, 'Grand B√¢tard' of Burgundy (or Portrait of Anthony of Burgundy) is an oil panel painting by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden portraying Anthony of Burgundy, the bastard son of Philip the GoodCampbell, 116 and one of his mistresses, Jeanne de Presle. The panel is dated to about 1460 and held in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Belgium. He wears the livery collar of Order of the Golden Fleece, a chivalric order established January 10, 1430, by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. In 1456 Anthony was inducted into the prestigious Order, held by only 29 others at that time. The exact significance of the arrow held in the bastard's hand is unknown, although the fleece is thought to refer to either the Greek mythological hero Jason or the Hebrew warrior and judge Gideon. The work is one of three high-profile van der Weyden portraits commissioned by the Dukes of Burgundy around 1460. The other two are his portraits of Philip the Good and Charles the Bold.Allmand, 444 In common with most of van der Weyden's male portraits, Antoine is shown half profile, staring aloofly into the middle distance. Portrait of Antoine attributed to Hans Memling, 1467‚Äì70 In his later commissioned portraits, van der Weyden typically flattered his sitters. He often idealised or softened their facial features, allowing them a handsomeness or beauty, or interest or intelligence they might not have been blessed with in life. If this portrait is compared to the unromantic portrait of Antoine attributed to Hans Memling, painted 8‚Äì10 years later, one can see the liberties taken by van der Weyden. Even allowing for aging, the artist seems to have enlarged the eyes, defined the contours of the face, and given a much stronger jaw than seen in Memling's portrait.Campbell, 15 The physical dissimilarities from other portraits of Anthony of Burgundy has made some critics tentatively identify the sitter of this portrait as John of Coimbra, Prince of Antioch, knight of the Golden Fleece who was sent into exile in Burgundy after his father Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra was killed in action in the Battle of Alfarrobeira when an arrow pierced his heart (thus providing a plausible explanation for the meaning of the arrow held by the sitter).

The team finished with a record of 47-35 (.573), and finished the season as the number-six seed, clinching a playoff berth for the first time since 2007. The team had a winning record for the first time since 2008. This season included the first playoff series victory for the first time since 2007, as most of the squad experienced postseason play for the first time. The season began a streak of 7 straight winning records. The Warriors had four draft picks in the 2012 NBA Draft, a decisive draft year that was vital for a potential future for the team. The picks included Harrison Barnes with the 7th pick, Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick. With Brandon Rush and his season-ending injury, Barnes was placed in the starting lineup and became crucial in bringing the team back to the playoffs for the first time in six years. Another injury mid-season from Andrew Bogut also affected the team with the lack of a true center for a majority of the season. Notable highlights from the season included Stephen Curry breaking the record for three-point field goals made in a single season with 272, thus eclipsing Ray Allen's then-seven-year-old record of 269 made, and Curry and Klay Thompson's rise to NBA dominance as one of the greatest three-point- shooting duos in history, coining the term \\"Splash Brothers\\" for their abilities to shoot beyond the arc in record-breaking numbers. A seven-game Eastern Conference road trip featured a 6-1 record, including a close win against the defending champion Miami Heat. David Lee was named as an All-Star in the 2013 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, and thus became the first Warrior since Latrell Sprewell in 1997 to be named an All-Star. Lee also led the league in double-doubles. The Warriors returned to the playoffs for the first time in six years; for most players the first time experiencing postseason play except Bogut. After a 4-2 series win against the number-three seed Denver Nuggets in the first round, the Warriors won a playoff series for the first time since 2007. In the Conference Semifinal, the Warriors faced the number two-seed San Antonio Spurs. Curry scored 44 points in a double-overtime loss in Game 1, but the team pulled off a 100-91 Game 2 win, which was the first Warriors victory, playoff or regular season, in San Antonio since February 1997, to tie the series at one game apiece. However, despite the willingness to fight, the inexperience and youth of the Warrior squad resulted in defeat as the Warriors lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion Spurs in six games.

Kennedy II, eldest son of Robert Kennedy. Joseph handed the flag to his mother, Ethel. Kennedy's coffin was lowered into the grave after family and friends had departed, and his body buried at 11:34 PM. Arlington National Cemetery officials claimed in 2011 that Robert F. Kennedy's burial is the only one ever to have taken place at night in the cemetery.\\"Robert F. Kennedy Grave Site.\\" Arlington National Cemetery. 2011. Retrieved 2012-07-22. However, in 1963, there was another night burial in the cemetery. Shortly after John F. Kennedy's burial, his two infant children were buried next to him in Arlington at night.John and Jacqueline Kennedy had a stillborn daughter, Arabella, in 1956. They also had a son, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, who was born in August 1963 but who lived only a few days. See: Raymond, Jack. \\"Arlington Assigns Plot of Three Acres to Kennedy Family.\\" New York Times. December 6, 1963; Pottker, 2001, p. 229-231. Senator Edward M. Kennedy's burial in 2009 also occurred at night.Barry, Dan. \\"Kennedy Mourners Memorialize 'Soul of the Democratic Party'.\\" New York Times. August 30, 2009. Accessed 2012-07-22. As with John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's first grave was a temporary one, about upslope from its current location.The Washington Post said the grave was originally about downslope from its permanent location. See: \\"Kennedy in Arlington.\\" Washington Post. February 9, 1969. This report appears to be incorrect, as the newspaper eight months later reported that Robert Kennedy's grave was \\"next to\\" the John F. Kennedy grave site. See: \\"Kennedy Gravesite Funds Remain in Bill.\\" Washington Post. October 11, 1969. Photography scholar Francisca Fuentes says Robert F. Kennedy was initially buried north-northeast of the John F. Kennedy grave site. She cites Philip Bigler's In Honored Glory (4th ed.) for this claim, but Bigler (4th ed.) does not mention the exact location of the grave. See: Fuentes, p. 202, fn. 3; Bigler, p. 89-90. A map in the New York Times showed the location of the temporary burial to be very near the permanent site. See: Madden, Richard L. \\"Kennedy Will Be Buried a Few Steps From the Arlington Grave of His Brother.\\" New York Times. June 8, 1968. A simple white wooden cross stood at the head of the grave, while a spray of flowers marked the foot of it. About 50,000 people (7,000 in the first three hours alone) visited the grave the day after the burial, while another 20,000 visited it the second day.\\"RFK Grave Is Visited By 20,000.\\" Washington Post. June 11, 1968. More than 7 million people visited both Kennedy grave sites between June 10, 1968, and June 6, 1969. Permanent grave site and memorial Looking down from Custis Walk at the Robert F. Kennedy memorial. The grave is out of sight just below the hill. The design of a permanent grave and memorial for Robert F. Kennedy was undertaken by the United States Army in full consultation with the Kennedy family.Special Subcommittee on Cemeteries, p. 4320. The family decided to build a memorial in the early fall of 1968. In late 1968, Ethel Kennedy chose I. M. Pei as the architect.\\"Memorial for RFK Is Left Up to Nixon.\\" Washington Post. February 1, 1969. Pei had worked with Robert F. Kennedy in 1966 as a consultant for a rejuvenation project of the Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn.Morrone and Iska, p. 252. and had been chosen by the Kennedy family as the architect for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.Wiseman, p. 99. Pei's design for the grave and memorial strongly reflected that of the nearby John F. Kennedy grave site designed by John Carl Warnecke, but on a much smaller scale. It was clear from the outset that the grave itself would not receive any special treatment. When John F. Kennedy was buried, Robert Kennedy had argued for a simple white cross for a burial marker. He was overruled by Jacqueline Kennedy.Isaacson, p. 301. Bowing to Robert Kennedy's previously expressed thoughts on the matter, the Kennedy family chose to adorn his grave with only a cross and a stone.Coonerty and Highsmith, 2007, p. 45.Thomas, p. 9. Pei's plan called for an informal grove of trees to surround the grave. The design for the memorial included a small semicircular plaza, a low grey granite wall inscribed with quotations from Robert Kennedy's speeches (similar to the wall at the John F. Kennedy site), and a small reflecting pool.Special Subcommittee on Cemeteries, p. 4319. The reflecting pool was designed to be only a few inches deep and about wide, and to extend the length of the wall. A straight granite pathway lead from the terrace at the John F. Kennedy grave to the semicircular plaza. The original plan called for a grove of trees to be planted between the two Kennedy grave sites (to screen them from one another), another grove to be planted close by, and a large American Beech to be grown south of the plaza. Pei's design for the grave and memorial took only a few weeks to complete. Using the same agreement reached by the government and the Kennedy family during the construction of the John F. Kennedy memorial, the Kennedy family agreed to pay 58 percent of the total cost of the Robert F. Kennedy site. This covered the grave and the memorial, with the total cost estimated at US$1,016,000. The government's share covered the construction of access roads and pathways, landscaping, and utilities. The plan for the grave site and memorial were approved by the Kennedy family, the U.S. Army, the United States Commission of Fine Arts, and the National Capital Planning Commission.Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of Representatives, 1972, p. 149. Using public funds for the grave and memorial proved contentious. Some members of the public expressed anger that the federal government was spending several hundred thousand dollars on a memorial to a private citizen. Others asked why a mere U.S. Senator was receiving special treatment when other senators buried at Arlington were not so honored.\\"Kennedy in Arlington.\\" Washington Post. February 9, 1969. Some of these arguments appeared in letters to the editor of the Washington Post. An angry Charles H. Percy, a Republican senator from Illinois, defended the expenditure, arguing that not making the improvements would lead to significant harm to the cemetery grounds as large numbers of people visited the grave.Percy, Charles H. \\"The Funds for the Kennedy Gravesite.\\" Washington Post. February 9, 1969. The Washington Post also strongly editorialized in favor of the expenditure. The United States Army Corps of Engineers submitted a budget request of $431,000 to cover its share of the costs in 1969. But President Johnson, for reasons which were not made clear, deleted the request from the Army's budget submission to Congress. Johnson added the request to the president's contingency fund budget submission instead, which effectively left the decision to build the memorial to the next president, Richard M. Nixon (who took office in January 1969). On February 1, 1969, Nixon approved the expenditure from the presidential funds, and placed presidential aide Bryce Harlow in charge of seeing construction through.\\"RFK Site Approved By Nixon.\\" Washington Post. February 2, 1969. The Army formally announced on June 6, 1969, that the memorial would be built for a total cost of US$677,000, with the Kennedys picking up about 62 percent of the total cost (and agreeing to pay for any cost overruns). The memorial would be due south of the John F. Kennedy grave site. The Army said, however, that construction would not begin until funds had been appropriated by Congress.\\"Family Leads Homage to Robert Kennedy.\\" Washington Post. June 7, 1969. As the presidential contingency fund budget request wound its way through Congress, some members of Congress also concluded that the federal government should not pick up the cost of the memorial's access roads and improvements. In the House of Representatives, Representative William J. Scherle (a Republican from Iowa) sponsored an amendment to strip the memorial funds from the president's budget request. The House defeated his amendment, 74-to-27, but the vote showed that there was at least some support for Scherle's position.\\"Kennedy Gravesite Funds Remain in Bill.\\" Washington Post. October 11, 1969. The cost of the grave and memorial were estimated again in 1970 and found to still be US$677,000, of which 62 percent would still be borne by the Kennedys. On October 21, 1970, Roubin and Janeiro, Inc. (a construction company based in Fairfax, Virginia) was awarded a contract to construct the new grave and memorial. The value of the contract was US$527,914.Subcommittee on Public Works, p. 1247. The total cost for the project was now US$747,000, with the Kennedy family now paying about 75.8 percent of the total cost.\\"Contract Let for Construction Of $747,000 Gravesite for RFK.\\" Washington Post. November 5, 1970. Construction began on November 9, 1970, and was expected to take a year.Subcommittee on Public Works, p. 1247. The approaches to both Kennedy graves were altered when the Robert F. Kennedy memorial was built. Previously, the approaches to the John F. Kennedy site consisted of a series of long steps. But several individuals in wheelchairs appealed to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and the steps were replaced by long ramps in June 1971. The design for the Robert Kennedy memorial, too, was changed to feature ramps rather than stairs.McCardle, Dorothy. \\"Paths for the Handicapped at Kennedy Grave Sites.\\" Washington Post. June 27, 1971. =Final site design= Aerial view of the John F. Kennedy (left) and Robert F. Kennedy graves in 2005, showing the relationship between the two sites. Robert F. Kennedy was disinterred on December 1, 1971, and his body moved to the new grave site.\\"Robert Kennedy's Body Now at Permanent Site.\\" United Press International. December 2, 1971. The disinterment, witnessed by Ethel Kennedy and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, began at 5:30 PM. Reburial was complete at about 9:00 PM.\\"RFK's Vault Moved to New Grave.\\" Washington Post. December 2, 1971. The final grave site and granite plaza were dedicated on December 6, 1971. Robert F. Kennedy's final resting place is about southwest of the terrace of the John F. Kennedy grave site.Reed, Roy. \\"Mourners Mark the Death of Robert Kennedy.\\" New York Times. June 7, 1969. Robert Kennedy is buried upslope from the plaza, his burial vault marked by a white wooden cross at its head and a slate headstone set flush with the earth at its foot. A low granite wall at the rear (straight, southeast side) of the plaza contains quotations from two famous Robert F. Kennedy speeches, with a small reflecting pool at the base of the wall. The granite for the plaza came from Deer Isle, Maine, which was also the source for the granite for the terrace at the John F. Kennedy gravesite. One quotation, which inspired the reflecting pool, is from a speech Kennedy delivered to students in South Africa in 1966. It reads: The second quotation is from an impromptu address Kennedy gave to an angry crowd of African Americans in Indianapolis, Indiana, the night Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. It reads: The final cost of the grave and memorial were US$747,000. Journalist Evan Thomas later wrote that the overall impression left by the Robert F. Kennedy grave and memorial plaza is one of loneliness and sadness. =Vandalism and theft= On January 4, 1970, vandals uprooted the white cross at the head of Kennedy's grave. Arlington National Cemetery officials quietly placed it back into position the same day.\\"Vandals Uproot Kennedy Cross.\\" Washington Post. January 5, 1970. The cross and the footstone marking Robert F. Kennedy's grave were stolen in 1981 and never recovered.\\"Robert Kennedy's Grave Loses Marker to Thieves.\\" Associated Press. December 28, 1981.

It stands in front of the Fenice Theater and adjacent to the Ateneo Veneto (the former Scuola grande di San Fantin). This parish church was first erected in the 10th century under the patronage of the patrician families from Barozzi, Aldicina, and Equilia. Reconstruction was undertaken by the Pisani family, who installed in the church a miraculous icon of the Virgin they had obtained from the East. The church of San Fantin by the 15th century came to be called the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie di San Fantino. Ten thousand ducats were willed for the church's reconstruction by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Zeno who died in 1501. A number of relics were transferred to this church including the body of Saint Marcellina and an armbone of the martyred Saint Trifone, Protector of Cattaro.Notizie storiche delle Chiese e Monasteri di Venezia e di Torcello By Flaminius Corner, Padova 1758, p. 218. Work on the church has been assigned or attributed to many architects, from Pietro Lombardo, Sebastiano Mariani, and later Jacopo Sansovino. Over the door of the sacristy is conserved the funeral urn of Vinciguerra Dandolo, a work by Tullio Lombardo. In 1908, the church was documented to hold two Piazzetta paintings: Liberation of Venice from the Plague and a Pieta.

Built in 1876 to cross Cedar Creek, the bridge is long and is made of pine with oak lattices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and is now used only for pedestrian traffic. History The Covered Bridge in 1937 The bridge was built in 1876, the result of a petition by area farmers. It was constructed to serve as a permanent replacement for previous bridges that had washed out on various occasions. In 1927, an abutment was added under the center of the bridge to support heavier vehicle traffic, such as cars and trucks, which were not present at the time of the original construction. The Ozaukee County Board took over the bridge's preservation and maintenance in 1940. In 1960, Ozaukee County bought the bridge and surrounding land for $7,500 and developed the area into Covered Bridge County Park. After nearly a century of continuous use, the bridge began to suffer, with the heavy traffic loosening the planks. It was decided that the only way to preserve the bridge was to alleviate the burden. In 1962, the Park Commission made the choice to relocate the bridge by moving it off the abutments to a location approximately east of where it was. It was also restricted to pedestrian traffic. A second, modern bridge was built beside it to the west, only a few yards away. This new bridge is now used for vehicular traffic on the adjacent Covered Bridge Road. The original bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 14, 1973. In 2009, the county planned to spend over $19,000 on capital improvements for the Covered Bridge County Park, with part of the money to be used for new decking and railings for the bridge. Construction and specifications Historic American Buildings Survey sketch The Covered Bridge is situated in a north-south orientation over Cedarburg Creek. It is a timber lattice truss bridge, and was originally long. It is wide, and has a height of about from the top of the abutments to the tip of the roof. The interior, from the deck to the top of the knee braces is approximately .April 1937 survey drawing legend by report by Clarence W. Jahn, Historic American Buildings Survey team Interior It was built using oak and pine timbers, wood that was prepared at a site near Baraboo, Wisconsin. The lattices are very large, made of oak, and were assembled without the use of bolts or nails. Instead, the trusses, consisting of planks, are secured at the joints using oak pegs measuring in diameter, and having rounded ends. The boards used at the sides and ends measure , and have joints covered by battens. There are diagonal braces that measure , and are tenoned to fit into cross tie beams, and fitted with oak wedges. The roof is shingled with cedar over rafters spaced apart. The cross tie beams at the floor are notched and bolted at each end. The floor joists, measuring , are decked with wood laid on edge forming the deck. The interior walls were lined with a protective wheel guard about one foot above the deck. The abutments are made of fieldstone set in white mortar. They are wide where they meet the deck of the bridge, widening toward the ground to about . The center abutment was originally also made of fieldstone, but sometime before 1937 was replaced with concrete.

It is an unincorporated community. History German settlers first immigrated to the area in the 1840s. Schumansville was named for the original landowner and settler of the community, August Wilhelm Schumann. Schumansville is located on the banks of the Guadalupe River in western Guadalupe County. The location on which Schumansville sits is on the Ignatius S. Johnson survey. Texas President, Anson Jones, issued a patent for the property in 1846, which consisted of 18 labors of land. August Wilhelm Schumann (1791-1858) immigrated from Kothen, West Prussia and arrived in Texas with his family in 1846. He purchased 3,188.5 acres of land from Ignatius S. Johnson. He received a wagon train of immigrants from West Prussia a few months later and agreed to sell them strips of land near the Guadalupe River. 350 acres were divided into 15 one mile long parcels of land. The settlers built their houses about 200 feet apart and then built a communal fence around their properties to protect their crops from local livestock. In those days, the residents found it a difficult trip fording the river to get to the county seat in Seguin, Texas. Because of this difficult travel to Seguin, they petitioned the Texas Legislature in 1849 to change the county lines, placing their German community with other Germans in Comal County. Their request was denied and they remained a part of Guadalupe County and made the trek to file for deed of their lands in September, 1850.Vivian Elizabeth Smyrl, \\"Schumansville, Texas,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed July 21, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Education was important in Schumansville and a school was built to service the community in 1851. Entrepreneurial individuals from Schumansville ventured to the east side of the Guadalupe river and established the town of Geronimo, Texas in 1860.Vivian Elizabeth Smyrl, \\"Geronimo, Texas,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed July 25, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. By 1904, the Schumansville educational facilities had doubled and two one-teacher schools served forty-nine students. A post office was constructed and operated from 1904 to 1906. The population declined in 1933, but after WWII the population had doubled and has steadily continued to climb through the present day. The Schumannsville Cemetery is located one and a half miles away, in the northern part of Schumann's land. The first loss of the community was the schoolteacher, Carl Blumberg, who died of yellow fever in 1853. The second burial was that of founder August Schumann who died in 1858. The rectangular shaped cemetery contains 2.75 acres of land and is the final resting place of at least 31 of the old German immigrants from Prussia. Their tombstones bear their German inscriptions. Geography Schumannsville is located at (29.6452268, -98.0766740. This is about northeast of downtown San Antonio and southwest of Austin. Schumansville is off FM 725, about northwest of Seguin, in western Guadalupe County.

She grew up in Kenya, before attending college in the United States. In college, she won three Division II national championships and was named an All-American eight times. She became eligible to compete for the United States in 2011. In 2012, she made the U.S. Olympic team in the 10,000 meters and placed 12th. Early life and college Cherobon-Bawcom was born as Janet Cherobon on August 22, 1978 in Kapsabet, a small village in Kenya, to a single mother. She is the oldest of eight children. At the age of 19, she was walking to the bus stop when a stranger offered her a ride. She accepted, and the man turned out to be 1988 gold medalist Peter Rono. He told her that running could serve as a route to gaining a scholarship to an American college. Intrigued, Cherobon took up running, with Rono as coach. After two years, Rono was able to secure her a scholarship to Harding University in Arkansas. Cherobon left Kenya in 2000. Upon arrival at Harding, she discovered that the school had been given false information about her running ability. Fearful that her scholarship would be pulled, she trained hard all summer to improve her times. Cherobon's training paid off. Over the next four years, named an All-American eight times, and set multiple school and national records in the process. In 2005, she won the Division II championship in the indoor 5,000 meters, the outdoor 5,000 meters, and the outdoor 10,000 meters. For her exploits, she was inducted into the Division II Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2010 and the Harding Athletic Hall of Fame in 2012. Cherobon graduated from Harding in 2005 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in health care management and nursing. Of her college experience, Cherobon later remarked: \\"I don't think I ever really became interested [in running.] I ran to get a scholarship so that I could get my education. My goal was to come here, learn as much as I can, and then go back. So if you had asked me my goal then ‚Äì that was my goal.\\" During college, she met future husband Jay Bawcom. Upon graduation, Janet Cherobon-Bawcom enrolled at Georgia Highlands College to obtain a license as registered nurse. She gave up running, having met her goal of using the sport to get a college education. Athletic career The competitive desire soon returned, and Cherobon-Bawcom began to enter, and win, regional road races. She added the half-marathon and marathon to her repertoire for the first time. Inspired by her success, she decided to seek out a top-notch coach, settling on Jack Daniels in 2011. His training style worked well for Cherobon-Bawcom and she quickly improved. In 2011, Cherobon-Bawcom was a three-time U.S. road champion, winning the 20 km (with a time of 1:08:31), the 10 mi (54:15), and the 10 km (32:47) races. In August, the IAAF declared her eligible to represent the United States in international competition. At the end of the year, she was declared the women's champion of the 2011 USA Running Circuit. =2012= At the January 2012, U.S. Olympic marathon trials, Cherobon-Bawcom finished fifth with a time of 2:29:45, besting her personal record by nearly eight minutes. For the first time in her career, she began to think of herself as a potential Olympian. \\"I thought, 'huh, maybe I have a chance,'\\" she later recalled. \\"I never thought I would be number five at the Olympic trials. I never dreamt of even running in an Olympic trials. I'm still discovering myself.\\" Later in 2012, she set a new American record in the 25 km, turning in a time of 1:24:36 at the U.S. road championship in the Fifth Third River Bank Run. She also won the 15 km road championships with a time of 49:41. In April, Cherobon-Bawcom ran a 31:33 10,000 meters at the Payton Jordan Cardinal Invitational, her first track race in seven years. Before the race, she was only hoping to qualify for the Olympic Trials. \\"I thought I might qualify for the trials and go run them just for fun, but making the team didn‚Äôt really cross my mind\\", she said. The time met the Olympic A standard, meaning she would be eligible to represent the United States at the 2012 Olympics. \\"Suddenly I had to change my thinking about the trials\\", she remarked. Heading into the June track and field Olympic Trials, only four American women had met the Olympic A standard. Shalane Flanagan opted to concentrate on the marathon, making Cherobon-Bawcom's qualification very likely. During the Trials, Cherobon-Bawcom was battling an upper respiratory ailment. She finished seventh in the 10,000 meters with a time of 32:17.06. However, no additional competitors made the A standard, so she still made the team. Afterwards she commented, \\"It's a terrible way to get on the team, but that's the way I got in. I'm so excited.\\" She later remarked \\"I've never even dreamt of going to the Olympics. If you had asked me that about a year ago I would have said 'you are out of your mind.'\\" Bawcom was the first ever Harding University alumna to compete at the Olympic Games. At the Olympics, Cherobon- Bawcom placed 12th in the 10,000 meter event. Her time of 31:12.68 improved her personal best by more than 20 seconds. \\"It was fantastic,\\" she remarked of the experience. \\"I couldn‚Äôt be any [more] proud to represent such a country with so much support. It‚Äôs a great opportunity for me to wear the uniform and do the best I can.\\" =2014= Janet Cherobon-Bawcom won the CU Cherry Blossom / USA 10 Mile Championships 2014 and set a women's only start American Record and championship record in 52:12. Janet's championship record stood a year when Molly Huddle won the USA 10 Mile Championships 2015 in 51:44, but the course is not certified for American Record. Personal life Janet Cherobon- Bawcom is married to Jay Bawcom. Bawcom, an American citizen from Searcy, Arkansas (home of Harding University), was volunteering in Kenya when he met Cherobon's mother. She asked him to bring her daughter a care package of tea and spices when he returned to the States, and he agreed. Janet and Jay subsequently fell in love and were married. As a result, Janet became a U.S. citizen in November 2010. The couple currently maintains two residences - one in Rome, Georgia, where Janet is pursuing her R.N. license, and one in Flagstaff, Arizona where Jay is enrolled at Northern Arizona University. Remarking on her unusual life journey, Cherobon-Bawcom said \\"I think God has a plan, and I think this is His plan ‚Äì my plan was different. But it's been through His guidance and the help of my family that I got to where I am today.\\" References External links * (archive) * Living people 1978 births American female long-distance runners Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Athletes (track and field) at the 2012 Summer Olympics Sportspeople from Rome, Georgia People from Nandi County Harding University alumni Kenyan female long-distance runners ","title":"Janet Cherobon-Bawcom"},{"id":"36506008","text":"Rear Admiral Charles Carroll Carpenter (February 27, 1834 ‚Äì April 1, 1899) was an officer in the United States Navy.

The EAAJAF espoused a radical Anti-Japaneseism ideology of revolution against the Japanese state, corporations, and symbols of Japanese imperialism, and was classified as a far-left illegal group inspired by anti-Japanese anarchism.Asahi Shimbun 4 September 1974 evening edition The EAAJAF committed a series of bombings as three cells during the early 1970s, including the 1974 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bombing, until it was disbanded when most of its membership were arrested by Japanese authorities. Some members joined the Japanese Red Army.  Origins and history  = L-Class Struggle Committee of Hosei University = The roots of the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front lie in the L-Class Struggle Committee, which was formed in the spring of 1970 by Masashi Daid≈çji, at that time enrolled in history courses at the department of humanities of Hosei University in Tokyo. The L-Class Struggle Committee's name comes from the university class that Daid≈çji was affiliated with, and factionally it was classified as \\"non-sect radical\\", a Japanese New Left movement who refused to align with the communists or any other established group. Daid≈çji called upon the philosophy and literature students of other departments to participate and membership briefly swelled to more than 100 people. However, along with the demise of the influential Zenkyoto (or All Campus Joint Struggle Committee) movement, the L-Class Struggle Committee also naturally came to an end and Daid≈çji then dropped out of Hosei University. = The Research Group = In August 1970, a \\"Research Group\\" was set up centering on Daid≈çji and the principal members of the L-Class Struggle Committee. This Group did intensive studies on the \\"evil deeds\\" of Japanese imperialism in Asia which fomented among them extreme anti-Japanese ideas. They used books such as Park Kyung Sik's as their then current study material. At the same time they also had an interest in urban guerrilla warfare and studied material on resistance movements, and before long these two topics converged into the idea that they had to build an armed anti-Japanese movement. In January 1971, the Research Group began undertaking their first experiments with homemade bombs. = Start of the \\"campaign struggle\\" = To start off it was decided that they would blow up structures that were symbols of Japanese imperialism as part of the so-called \\"campaign struggle\\" making an appeal to the masses. They undertook three attacks, the bombing at the Koa Kannon temple on 12 December 1971, the bombing of the Soji-ji Ossuary on 6 April 1972, and the bombing of the Fusetsu no Gunzo and Institute of Northern Cultures on 23 October 1972. They considered these targets to be associated respectively with Japan‚Äôs participation in World War II, the Japanese colonization of Korea, and the subjugation of the Ainu of Hokkaido. After these three attacks, they decided to shift to full-blown terrorist bombings. = Birth of the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front = In December 1972, the group decided on the name East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front (EAAJAF) but were aware that this was a name that could be used generically by any anti-Japanese group. The EAAJAF decided they needed individual names for their own cells, with Daid≈çji and his team settled on the name to express an image of proud independence. In 1973, the EAAJAF were preparing for their attacks, developing bombs and saving up a war chest to fund their operations. They constructed the bombs with the tools and basic necessities that they had on hand, but there were also members who dug under the floor of their own apartments and created underground bomb-making cellars. In addition, to bring their messages to the public they set about writing their own tract, the Hara Hara Tokei, which they published in March 1974. On 14 August 1974, they tried to blow up the iron bridge over which Emperor Hirohito's royal train was travelling, which they code-named the \\"Rainbow Operation\\". However, the plot was aborted because a member was spotted shortly before it was to be put into action. The following day, an assassination attempt on the life of President Park Chung-hee of South Korea was made by Mun Segwang, a member of Chongryon and a militant who hailed from the \\"Armed Front of High School Students for Violent Revolution\\", an organization affiliated with the Proletarian Army that in turn had a number of ties with anarchists. The EAAJAF's Wolf cell was spurred into new terrorist bombings in sympathy with Mun Segwang. On 30 August 1974, the EAAJAF committed the 1974 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bombing when they exploded a bomb at the Tokyo head office of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, killing 8 people and wounding 376 others. The bombing caused destruction that far surpassed EAAJAF's expectations, and from there they launched serial bombings against Japanese corporations with the newly joined and cells until May 1975. = Mass arrests = At first Ryu Ota, who, like the EAAJAF, advocated an \\"Ainu revolution\\" at that time, was suspected as a member. Before long Ota's innocence was proven, but the Japanese police presumed that there were EAAJAF operatives somewhere in his ideological circle and, as a result of deciding to target the \\"Revolt Society\\" and the \\"Contemporary Thought Society\\" that Ota was involved with, the members Nodoka Saito and Norio Sasaki floated to the surface. While tailing these two, the other members of the group were deduced one after another. Sasaki joined Soka Gakkai and though he pretended to be an enthusiastic member doing things like giving the lotus sutra every day, he was not able to escape the eyes of the law. On 19 May 1975, seven key members: Masashi Daid≈çji and his wife Ayako, Saito, Ekida, Sasaki, Masunaga, and Kurokawa, were arrested as well as a nursing student who was considered a collaborator. Saito committed suicide soon after his arrest, and two members who escaped the roundup, Ugajin and Kirishima, were put on the national wanted list.  Developments since the EAAJAF's demise  On 4 August 1975, the Japanese Red Army took hostages at the United States consulate in Kuala Lumpur and the Japanese government gave in to their demands to release Norio Sasaki among others. The trials of the remaining terrorists were started from 25 December 1975, but on 28 September 1977 a team of Japanese Red Army operatives including Sasaki hijacked Japan Airlines Flight 472 and two days later forced the release of Ayako Daid≈çji and Yukiko Ekida. They both joined the Japanese Red Army. In 1979, Hara Hara Tokei Special Issue #1 was published underground by a group called East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front KF Unit, named after the codenames of two members who committed suicide. It was believed that the book, which reaffirmed the anti-Japanese armed struggle, was created by the still- jailed members because the address of the publisher was the Tokyo Detention House. Masashi Daid≈çji and Toshiaki Masunaga were given the death penalty, and Yoshimasa Kurokawa was given life imprisonment with hard labor. In July 1982, Hisaichi Ugajin was arrested and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with hard labor. On 24 March 1995 Yukiko Ekida was detained while in hiding in Romania on suspicion of forging a private document. She was deported, arrested on the plane to Japan, and at trial was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment with hard labor. She was released on March 23, 2017, after completing her sentence. Today, Norio Sasaki and Ayako Daid≈çji are still wanted internationally. The statute of limitations on Satoshi Kirishima's crimes has elapsed. Daid≈çji died in prison on May 24, 2017, due to complications from multiple myeloma. Masunaga, who is still on death row, is requesting new trials while undertaking a \\"struggle behind bars\\" which includes writing revolutionary essays and books from his prison cell. Daid≈çji also engaged in this \\"struggle\\" up until his death.  Distinguishing characteristics  Perhaps because they were originally classmates, the EAAJAF was known for rejecting the , of which manifested as sometimes violent self-criticism sessions popular within Japanese New Left groups, in order to expose those among their members who were not ideologically pure. The United Red Army for example murdered 14 of its 29 members in less than a year through such sessions. By contrast, there were no bloody purges in the EAAJAF and those members who had family commitments or were unable to mentally endure the struggle were permitted to leave without penalty. Nahoko Arai, who helped write Hara Hara Tokei, and Yoshimi Fujisawa, who was part of the group's early trainings with explosives, both left the group without incident after raising personal issues. The EAAJAF did not have any centralized systems or leadership such as a central committee. The leaders of EAAJAF's three cells were in contact with one another and nothing more. There was no mingling among fellow members and even their ideological positions were different in subtle ways. EAAJAF members also did not disassociate from the public sphere. They adopted the policy of working by day as normal corporate employees or servers at cafes and preparing their operations by night. This policy was also set out in Hara Hara Tokei and the idea was that by not engaging in activism and pretending to be completely upstanding citizens they would not arouse the mistrust of those around them. Because of that, EAAJAF members did not participate in labor movements at their workplaces or social movements in their neighborhoods. Whereas other groups such as Red Army Faction of the Communist Alliance, a precursor to the Japanese Red Army, raised funds through illegal means including bank robberies, EAAJAF operatives received wages working at regular jobs and secured a legal source of revenue by investing half of their earnings into their operations. Even though the EAAJAF recognized self-funding as a core principle, on the other hand they declined to completely rule out robberies following a full examination of their targets and methods. = Ideology = As they studied the history of aggression by Japan against Korea and the Ainu, the EAAJAF acquired its personal \\"anti-Japanese ideology\\". They considered not only those in power, but also Japanese corporations and laborers as \\"perpetrators of imperialist aggression\\" and believed that they were acceptable targets for attack. Hara Hara Tokei refers to the Japanese people with a name of their own creation, as , meaning \\"people born of Japanese imperialism\\", and condemns all ordinary citizens who did not support the \\"anti-Japanese struggle\\" as active members of the empire. In their claim of responsibility released after the 1974 bombing of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries they justified the indiscriminate terrorist attack by saying \\"People who were wounded or who died in the bombing are not uninvolved normal citizens. They are colonialists\\". Because of these dangerous and overly self-righteous ideas, even with the influence of the then New Left the number of people who supported the EAAJAF was few. Even the Front's leader, Masashi Daid≈çji, eventually apologized for his tactics. Since the 1970s, most Japanese New Left organizations had undertaken cautious \\"situational analyses\\" and based on those they acted in a planned manner to \\"start the revolution in Japan\\" from their own prepared blueprints, even if they didn't always directly confront their own gradual alienation from the Japanese masses. In contrast to this, organizations like the EAAJAF that advocated \\"anti-Japanese ideology\\", even if they did have the ambitious goal of \\"destroying Japan\\", did not have a concrete plan to achieve it. On the basis of their ideology, the EAAJAF undertook ad hoc terrorist attacks as \\"payback for the historical sins of Japanese imperialism\\", and they tended to not pay much heed to whether or not they had popular support, though they did argue that the day laborers of Sanya were true revolutionary warriors. = Membership = The EAAJAF divided itself into small terrorist cells symbolically named after animals to represent the nature of their organization and the themes of its ideology: *The Wolf cell likened the 'oppressed masses' who were being 'tormented by capitalists' to the extinct Honshu wolf. Its members were the founder Masashi Daid≈çji, his wife Ayako Daid≈çji, as well as Toshiaki Masunaga and Norio Sasaki. *The Fangs of the Earth cell made its goal an ideal world without nation-states or capitalists and likened itself to fangs rising from the Earth to oppose them. Its members were Nodoka Saito and his wife Yukiko Ekida. *The Scorpion cell likened itself to a scorpion that will topple big capital and big buildings with the deadly poison of its own small organization. Its members were Yoshimasa Kurokawa, Hisaichi Ugajin, and Satoshi Kirishima.  Copycat crimes  In the latter half of the 1970s there was a succession of terrorist bombings seen as having been caused by anti-Japanese ideologues influenced by the EAAJAF or Ryu Ota. There were instances where the terrorist attacks were caused by people who called themselves sympathizers of or successors to the EAAJAF. Although it was acknowledged that they had no direct relation to the imprisoned EAAJAF members, claims of responsibility in the name of the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front were put out in a series of terrorist bombings in Hokkaido between 1975 and 1976 including the bombing of a police station on 19 July 1975 that wounded four and the bombing of a government building on 2 March 1976 in which two were killed. Katsuhisa Omori was given the death sentence by the Sapporo District Court for the crimes in 1983, reaffirmed in 1994 and 2007, and is currently on death row, though he proclaims his innocence and admits only to sympathizing with the ideas contained within the claims of responsibility. Another sympathizer is Saburo Kato, who wounded 6 in his bombing of the Association of Shinto Shrines in Tokyo on 27 October 1977. A case occurred near the end of March 1985 in which threatening letters were placed in several large supermarkets near JNR's Yokohama Station that read \\"I will blow up this store with plastic explosives. ‚ÄîEast Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front\\". In a series of incidents 40 such letters were placed and threatening phone calls were made including demands for money, but on March 30 when police were on the lookout they caught in the act a third-year male middle school student from Midori-ku Yokohama. He said that his motive was to extort money as in the Glico Morinaga case and that he also copied a tactic of the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front which he learned about at a library.Asahi Shimbun 31 March 1985 Tokyo evening edition  See also  *Anti-Japaneseism *Japanese Red Army * New Left in Japan *United Red Army *Hara Hara Tokei *Tori Kudo * Revolutionary Communist League, National Committee * Japan Revolutionary Communist League (Revolutionary Marxist Faction) * Anti-Germans (political current)  References   Bibliography  * Andrews, William Dissenting Japan: A History of Japanese Radicalism and Counterculture, from 1945 to Fukushima.

It was undertaken by a group which would soon be known as the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front, though this name was not decided on until later in the same year.  Origin and history of the target  The remains that were laid in Joshoden, the ossuary of Soji-ji in Yokohama, are those of about 5,000 Japanese who lived in Korea under Japanese rule originally buried in the cemeteries of Keijo, the then capital of Korea which is now Seoul. After the end of colonialism these remains were left unattended so at the behest of Mayor Kim Hyonok an ossuary was built in 1970 at a civilian cemetery in Seoul. However, a series of anti-Japanese attacks damaged this ossuary and finally on 15 August 1971 it was destroyed. The remains, which were out of necessity incinerated, were returned to Japan and it was decided that they would be entrusted to Soji-ji, the main temple of the Soto school.  Attack  The East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front decided to blow up the ossuary where \\"the bones of the invaders\\" laid in the name of \\"a resistance campaign for the Korean people\\". The date 1 March 1972 was chosen as the day to act due to its association with the March 1st Movement. However, because the staff at the temple saw the face of one of the members while doing advance inspection of the target, the plotters split into a group that sought to go ahead as planned and a group that wanted to play it safe and postpone the attack. The former group suffered its own internal split and disbanded. The remaining faction moved forward with their preparations and on 6 April detonated a bomb disguised as a fire extinguisher on the headstone. Although it made a deafening noise and opened a large hole in the ground, it did not cause serious damage to the ossuary.

Masashi Daidoji in particular, the Hokkaido-born leading member of the plotters, had a special interest in the Japanese-Ainu conflict. They set 23 October as the date of the bombing.

History  The East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front was planning the publication of a book to make their ideas widely known in Japanese society. In the autumn of 1973 they bought a Japanese typewriter and made use of it heavily in implementing this plan. The leader of their ‚Äúwolf cell‚Äù Masashi Daidoji wrote the text and collaborators who were not members typed it with the typewriter.Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition. One of the collaborators was a nursing student. The other was her elder sister who committed suicide after her younger sister was arrested. It was printed at a printing company in Kushiro, Hokkaido where Daidoji‚Äôs high school senpai was working. At first members of the EAAJAF were about to settle on the title of ‚ÄúGuidebook for the Urban Guerrilla Soldier Volume 1‚Äù, but some suggested that a different name that left more to the imagination would be better, just like How to Raise Flower Bulbs, the publication used by the old Mountain Village Operation Unit. Because of this ‚ÄúA Soldier‚Äôs Handbook Volume 1‚Äù was relegated to the subtitle and they decided to go with a different motif. Because there was a description of timing devices in the book, they went with a name related to clocks, or tokei in Japanese. In the end, they decided on ‚ÄúHara Hara Tokei‚Äù. ‚ÄúHara Hara‚Äù carries a double meaning of heart-pounding suspense (hara hara) from an explosive device, and the hara command form used in the Korean language for written instructions. The suggested retail price of the manual was said to be 100 yen,Asahi Shimbun 24 May 1975 morning edition. and on the back cover of the original print edition they put as an inset image the cover of a South Korean magazine which was banned by the regime of Park Chung-hee because the printing company published the anti-war poems of Kim Chi-ha.Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition Thanks to this book, the EAAJAP‚Äôs ‚Äúwolf cell‚Äù, led by Daidoji, attained members for the ‚Äúscorpion cell‚Äù and ‚Äúfangs of the Earth cell‚Äù. Because restrictions on publishing itself were impossible due to constitutional guarantees on freedom of speech, the investigating authorities issued arrests for instigating and abetting the creation of explosive devices under Section 4 of the Explosives Control Act.Asahi Shimbun 16 October 1974 morning edition It became clear to the police that the text and contents of their statements at the start of the book were tantamount to written confessions of the crimes and thus, through use of them to deduce the identities of the members, the organization was annihilated.  Contents of the book  Within Hara Hara Tokei is an overview of the anti-Japanese ideology in which the EAAJAP believed and also detailed explanations of methods of waging guerrilla war and of making and setting up bombs. Concerning bomb-making, the manual explains with illustrations that ‚ÄúAnyone with a middle-school level knowledge of chemistry can do it‚Äù. As ingredients, the manual recommends a mixed explosive making use of sodium chlorite-based herbicides which, if one goes to rural communities where weeds are a problem in summer, can be bought in great quantity without being noted as anything suspicious.Specific brand names were also written down, but as a result of their terrorist attacks, manufacture of sodium chlorite-based herbicides has fallen into disuse. Furthermore, Hara Hara Tokei also includes guidelines for blending in with ordinary citizens and not arousing suspicion which were published as a way to circumvent ‚ÄúHow to Spot an Extremist‚Äù, which was Chapter 5 of an appeal for cooperation made around the year 1971 by the investigating authorities to the Japanese people to expose members of extremist groups like the Japanese Red Army. Media reports describe the following guidelines that members of the EAAJAP put into practice.Asahi Shimbun 28 October 1974 evening edition * Extreme obsession with secrecy at your home and not associating with others are, on the contrary, just digging your own grave. Exchange a minimal number of greetings and show that you have regular daily habits. * There is no particular need to cut ties with family members. * Don‚Äôt at all flaunt your left-wing political views. * Don‚Äôt associate with the ‚Äúlegal left‚Äù. Because they are fickle and can‚Äôt keep secrets they cannot be trusted. Incidentally, the investigative authorities thought that Hara Hara Tokei‚Äôs sole flaw was that it didn‚Äôt give lessons on destruction of evidence.Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition The Public Security Bureau were keeping their suspects under surveillance and they said that what led to the mass arrest of the entire group was the discovery of envelopes with rough drafts of their claims to responsibility in the trash outside their hideout immediately after the simultaneous bombing of Oriental Metal and the Korean Industry Economic Research Institute on 19 April 1975.  Influence of the book  There were also many among other factions of the Japanese New Left who were critical of the anti-Japanese ideology of the EAAJAF itself, but even their militant members made the parts of Hara Hara Tokei dealing with techniques of bomb construction into their textbook. Hara Hara Tokei even transcended ideology and spread among the far-right and ultranationalist militants. There was an incident in May 1985 where letter bombs were sent to the headquarters of the left-wing Japan Teachers Union and its affiliate in Mie Prefecture and at the latter a female staff member‚Äôs hair was burned. A copy of Hara Hara Tokei was confiscated from the arrested perpetrator who belonged to an ultranationalist group in Shimane Prefecture.Asahi Shimbun 13 July 1985 evening edition. Having said that, because it was a letter bomb the structure of the explosive wasn‚Äôt the same as those in Hara Hara Tokei.

The Mountain Village Operation Unit emulated Mao Zedong‚Äôs strategy of forming a base of operations in rural villages, but it achieved no successes.  Background and history  In November 1949 China‚Äôs Liu Shaoqi urged spreading China‚Äôs methods of armed struggle across Asia including in Japan. He proposed this on the basis of his talks with Joseph Stalin. On 6 June 1950 Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, ordered a purge of 24 members of JCP‚Äôs Central Committee and forbade them from engaging in any political activities. General Secretary Kyuichi Tokuda and his allies saw this repression as a perfect opportunity to take personal control of the party and, through an informal process that did not involve convening the Central Committee or the Politburo, he named the Interim Central Directorate. Tokuda excluded seven Central Committee members, including Kenji Miyamoto, who held dissenting points of view, and went underground. Following the red purge, Tokuda and his group went into exile in China and on 23 February 1951, at the JCP‚Äôs 4th National Conference, they decided on a policy of armed resistance against the American occupation of Japan, issuing orders to form a ‚Äúliberated zone‚Äù in the rural villages across the country, particularly among peasants in mountain villages, just like the tactics employed by the Chinese Communist Party in the Second Sino-Japanese War. At the 5th National Conference of October 16 a new manifesto-like document was adopted called ‚ÄúPresent Demands of the Japanese Communist Party‚Äù which included clauses on waging guerrilla war in the villages. Then clandestine organizations were created including the , for weapons' procurement and training, the Dokuritsu Yugekitai, for offensive guerrilla operations, and the Mountain Village Operation Unit. The armed struggle was activated throughout the country, including terrorist attacks on police officers, arson against police boxes and bombing trains. Then in July 1952 the Subversive Activities Prevention Law was enacted and enforced to clamp down on the JCP‚Äôs attacks. Direct attacks with Molotov cocktails, the preferred weapon of the insurgents, abated from about the summer of 1952 but the JCP‚Äôs militant policy did not change and operations in the countryside were continued. These campaign tactics also drew the ire of popular opinion and they suffered a setback in the elections of October 1952 in which all their candidates were defeated. On 1 January 1955 the Japanese Communist Party engaged in self-criticism, labeling the insurgency ‚Äúadventurism of the extreme left‚Äù, and at the 6th National Conference of 29 July 1955 the policy of armed struggle was renounced. After the 6th National Conference the JCP adopted a policy of not excluding any party members who, though they had made mistakes, recognized the errors of the armed struggle and party split and intended sincerely to make effort in supporting the new party line.„ÄéÊó•Êú¨ÂÖ±Áî£ÂÖö„ÅÆÂÖ´ÂçÅÂπ¥ 1922ÔΩû2002„Äè Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Publishing Bureau, 2003, page 126 People who didn‚Äôt accept this shift by the party to peaceful accommodation formed the nucleus of a variety of Japanese new left movements. Currently, the Japanese Communist Party‚Äôs official evaluation is that ‚ÄúThe policy of the 5th National Conference was not officially adopted by the party but rather was born from the breakup and subsequent takeover of the party apparatus by Tokuda‚Äôs Shokanha faction and the imposition of armed struggle on us by the Soviet Union and China. The division of the party and the extreme-left adventurism orchestrated by the Shokanha were a serious mistake.‚Äù  How to Raise Flower Bulbs  ‚ÄúHow to Raise Flower Bulbs‚Äù was the secret publication setting out concepts relating to the party‚Äôs military policy such as construction and use of Molotov cocktails. It was actually an official bulletin called ‚ÄúInternal and External Critiques‚Äù, but took the title of ‚ÄúHow to Raise Flower Bulbs‚Äù in order to disguise that. It was published several times through mimeograph.The publication is reprinted in the following two books. Yutaka Haniya Ed, „ÄéÊà¶ÂæåÊó•Êú¨ÊÄùÊÉ≥Â§ßÁ≥ª-6-Èù©ÂëΩ„ÅÆÊÄùÊÉ≥„Äè Chikuma Shobo„ÄÅ1969.

Participation in the Mountain Village Operation Unit  The policies of the Mountain Village Operation Unit were out of touch with the real situation in the countryside and they were not supported at all by the locals. The exception was the travelling clinics operated by deployed medical teams who were greeted warmly in many of the villages they visited without local doctors. However, their arts and culture-based campaign, including such thing as kamishibai attacking ‚Äúfeudalistic‚Äù landlords, was not accepted by locals and their newspapers and propaganda leaflets were quickly handed over to the police. Without achieving any of its aims, the operations of the Mountain Village Operation Unit were extinguished by a police crackdown. In deference to the policy of the JCP, there were also students who had quit their studies and joined the Mountain Village Operation Unit. It is said that these participants were in deep despair at the change in policy of the 6th National Conference. Some of the members who escaped exposure in the police crackdown holed up in the mountains and aimed to support themselves but, being neglected and unsupplied by the JCP, they naturally dissolved. The recollections of participants are published in certain new left bulletins, and the Mountain Village Operation Unit at the time of the 6th National Conference is the backdrop for Sho Shibata‚Äôs Akutagawa Award-winning 1964 novel Saredo Warera ga Hibi (\\"Those Were the Days, However...\\"). On the other hand, it is thought that there were differences in the directive and goals of ‚ÄúY Organization‚Äù on the one hand, the JCP‚Äôs Military Affairs Committee including the Chukaku Jieitai and Dokuritsu Yugekitai which were purely in the armed struggle, and the Mountain Village Operation Unit on the other hand where armed struggle coexisted with appeals to the masses. There were also people among the members of Mountain Village Operation Unit who thought that the policy of armed struggle was an absurd idea and remained active in the Unit without supporting the policy. Participation in the Unit was by the appointment of the JCP Directorate which supported Kyuichi Tokuda‚Äôs Shokanha faction, and there are some who testified that service was assigned as a punishment to students who had belonged to the former faction of Kenji Miyamoto.Chikai Yui „ÄéÁî±‰∫ïË™ìÈÅ∫Á®ø„ÉªÂõûÊÉ≥„Äè Êñ∞Âà∂‰ΩúÁ§æ„ÄÅ1987.Noriaki Tsuchimoto „Äå„ÄåÂ∞èÊ≤≥ÂÜÖÂ±±ÊùëÂ∑•‰ΩúÈöä„Äç„ÅÆË®ò„Äç„ÄéÊò†Áîª„ÅØÁîü„Åç„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„ÅÆ‰ªï‰∫ã„Åß„ÅÇ„Çã„Äè„ÄÅMiraisha„ÄÅ1974.

The book is a companion piece to her earlier work Fun Home, which deals with her relationship with her father. The book interweaves memoir with psychoanalysis and exploration of various literary works, particularly Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. Its title alludes to the 1960 children's picture book Are You My Mother? by P. D. Eastman. Synopsis Are You My Mother? is composed of seven chapters, each introduced by a description of a dream that Bechdel had. The dream is then interpreted and explained in the context of various events in Bechdel's life, jumping backwards and forwards in time in doing so. The book covers events that occurred before she was born all the way up to the process of editing Are You My Mother? itself. The book is Bechdel's attempt to come to grips with her relationship with her mother, an unaffectionate amateur actor trapped in a marriage to a closeted homosexual. In exploring her mother's lack of warmth, Bechdel supplements her own recollections with insights from the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, particularly with reference to his notion of the true self and the false self and his theory on transitional objects. While various scenes depicting visits to psychologists later in life make it clear that Bechdel's childhood left a troubling mark on her adult life, the book ends on an uplifting note, concluding with the lines, \\"There was a certain thing I did not get from my mother. There is a lack, a gap, a void. But in its place, she has given me something else. Something, I would argue, that is far more valuable. She has given me the way out.\\" Much like Fun Home, Are You My Mother? folds various other works into the story to help illuminate the narrative. As well as the writings of Donald Winnicott, Bechdel pulls from the works of the feminist poet and essayist Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse and A Room of One's Own, the works of Sigmund Freud, the 1967 television adaption of The Forsyte Saga, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Moli√®re's The Miser, and many other works. Reception In her book review for The New York Times, Katie Roiphe wrote that Are You My Mother? is \\"as complicated, brainy, inventive and satisfying as the finest prose memoirs.\\" Laura Miller's review for The Guardian called the book profound, but stated that the book's heavy focus on psychoanalysis weighs it down. The book won the 2013 Judy Grahn Award for Lesbian Non-Fiction, and was a shortlisted finalist for the 2013 Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Memoir or Biography.

Pound uses this anecdote to emphasize an empirical approach for learning about art, in contrast to relying on commentary rooted in abstraction. While the parable is based on students' recollections of Louis Agassiz's teaching style, Pound's retelling diverges from these sources in several respects. The parable has been used to illustrate the benefits of scientific thinking, but more recent literary criticism has split on whether the parable accurately reflects the scientific process and calls into question Pound's empirical approach to literature. The Parable Ezra Pound in 1920 The text of the parable below is excerpted from Pound's ABC of Reading. > A post-graduate student equipped with honors and diplomas went to Agassiz to > receive the final and finishing touches. The great man offered him a small > fish and told him to describe it. Post-Graduate Student: \\"That's only a > sunfish.\\" Agassiz: \\"I know that. Write a description of it.\\" After a few > minutes the student returned with the description of the Ichthus > Heliodiplodokus, or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from > vulgar knowledge, family of Heliichtherinkus, etc., as found in textbooks of > the subject. Agassiz again told the student to describe the fish. The > student produced a four-page essay. Agassiz then told him to look at the > fish. At the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of > decomposition, but the student knew something about it. Context =ABC of Reading= Pound opens ABC of Reading with the following pronouncement: > The proper METHOD for studying poetry and good letters is the method of > contemporary biologists, that is careful first-hand examination of the > matter, and continual COMPARISON of one 'slide' or specimen with another. No > man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of > Agassiz and the sunfish. Louis Agassiz In the parable, a graduate student is sent to noted biologist Louis Agassiz to complete his education, and Agassiz asks the student three times to describe a sunfish specimen. The student replies with, in turn, the common name of the fish, a brief summary of the species, and a four-page essay on the species. Agassiz finally tells the student to \\"look at the fish\\" and \\"[a]t the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it.\\" The text of the parable itself spans 131 words over sixteen lines and is often reproduced in full when cited. Pound contrasts this empiricism against knowledge gained through increasingly abstract definitions. As an example, Pound relates what might happen if a European is asked to define \\"red\\". After the initial response that red is a color, Pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it described in terms of vibration, with vibration then defined in terms of energy, and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power. Returning to empiricism, Pound reminds the reader that the progress of science increased rapidly once \\"Bacon had suggested the direct examination of phenomena, and after Galileo and others had stopped discussing things so much, and had begun really to look at them\\". Pound provides several other examples of the same contrasting ideas throughout the first chapter, ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry, Chinese writing, and Stravinsky. At the end of the chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge. =Literary essays= Pound subsequently refers to the parable in two essays: \\"The Teacher's Mission\\" and \\"Mr Housman at Little Bethel\\". Both were republished in The Literary Essays of Ezra Pound and reference Agassiz without including details of the parable. \\"The Teacher's Mission\\" in particular provides a straightforward explanation of how Pound wished the parable to be interpreted. \\"Mr Housman at Little Bethel\\" In January 1934, Pound published a critique of A. E. Housman's The Name and Nature of Poetry in the Criterion. As part of the critique, Pound offers an emendation to Housman's claim that \\"the intelligence\\" of the eighteenth century involved \\"some repressing and silencing of poetry\\". Pound replies that the root cause was the tendency towards abstract statements, which came about in part because eighteenth century authors \\"hadn't heard about Professor Agassiz's fish.\\" \\"The Teacher's Mission\\" Also in 1934, Pound published an essay critiquing existing methods for teaching literature in general and university-level instruction methods in particular. He identifies the root of the problem as abstraction and uses the word \\"liberty\\" as an example of a term where a specific, concrete meaning has been lost. Pound finds this situation \\"inexcusable AFTER the era of 'Agassiz and the fish'\\" and demands an approach to general education that \\"parallels ... biological study based on EXAMINATION and COMPARISON of particular specimens.\\" Sources Louis Agassiz was a Swiss-born scientist at Harvard University who, by 1896, had established a reputation for \\"lock[ing] a student up in a room full of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not let[ting] him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained.\\" Several students of Agassiz who went on to prominence recorded this rite of passage, including Henry Blake, David Starr Jordan, Addison Emery Verrill, and Burt Green Wilder. American literary critic Robert Scholes traces the parable's source to two narratives in particular: those of former students Nathaniel Southgate Shaler and Samuel Hubbard Scudder. Their anecdotes were reprinted in Lane Cooper's Louis Agassiz as a Teacher: Illustrative Extracts on his Method of Instruction. Their separate accounts differ markedly from Pound's: both students provide oral reports with a wealth of detail after being initially forbidden from consulting outside sources. =Shaler's Autobiography= Nathaniel Southgate Shaler Nathaniel Shaler left his humanist studies and joined Agassiz's lab at Harvard University, having already read Agassiz's introductory essay on classification. His autobiography details his initial interactions with Agassiz. With regard to his first assignment, Shaler recorded that Agassiz brought him a small fish to study with the stipulation that Shaler not discuss it with anyone or read anything on the topic until Agassiz had given him permission. When Shaler asked Agassiz for more explicit instructions, Agassiz replied that he could not be more explicit than saying \\"[f]ind out what you can without damaging the specimen\\". After the first hours, Shaler thought he had \\"compassed that fish,\\" but despite Agassiz always being \\"within call\\" he was not asked to present his conclusions. During the course of the following week, Shaler recorded the details of \\"how the scales went in series, their shape, the form and placement of the teeth, etc.\\" > At length on the seventh day, came the question \\"Well?\\" and my disgorge of > learning to him as he sat on the edge of my table puffing his cigar. At the > end of the hour's telling, he swung off and away, saying \\"That is not > right.\\" Shaler concluded Agassiz was testing him to see if he was capable of \\"doing hard, continuous work without the support of a teacher\\" and redoubled his efforts, starting from scratch and, over the course of seven ten-hour days, managed to describe the specimen to Agassiz's satisfaction. =Scudder's \\"Look at your fish!\\"= Samuel Hubbard Scudder Samuel Hubbard Scudder recorded a similar experience, first published in 1874 as \\"Look at Your Fish\\" in Every Saturday magazine. Agassiz again starts his new student off with a fish preserved in alcohol and instructs the student to \\"look at it\\", and promises \\"by and by I will ask what you have seen\\". As opposed to Pound's decomposing sunfish, Scudder's account emphasizes the care taken to keep the specimen in good condition: > I was to keep the fish before me in a tin tray, and occasionally moisten the > surface with alcohol from the jar ... In ten minutes I had seen all that > could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor ‚Äì who > had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over > some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry > all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast > from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal > sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to > return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion. Scudder provides the additional detail that \\"instruments of all kinds were interdicted\\", including any magnifying glass. After several hours Agassiz asks for a report and Scudder describes \\"the fringed gill-arches and moveable operculum; the pores of the head, fleshy lips and lidless eyes; the lateral line, the spinous fins and forked tail; the compressed and arched body\\". Disappointed, Agassiz informs his student that he has failed to observe \\"the most conspicuous features of the animal\\" and commands him to \\"look again, look again!\\" The mortified Scudder is eventually asked to consider overnight what he has seen, and is able to report to Agassiz the following morning that \\"the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs\\", which was the observation Agassiz was looking for. However, when Scudder then asked what he should do next, Agassiz replied, \\"Oh, look at your fish!\\" which Scudder did for another two full days. =Cooper's Louis Agassiz as a Teacher= In 1917, English professor Lane Cooper from Cornell University published a collection of reminiscences of Agassiz. The book included notes from several notable contributors, including Scudder and Cooper, William James, Professor Addison Emery Verrill (\\"[Agassiz's] plan was to make young students depend on natural objects rather than on statements in books\\"), and Professor Edward S. Morse, who wrote that Agassiz's method was \\"simply to let the student study intimately one object at a time.\\" Cooper prefigures Pound's interest by remarking on the \\"close, though not obvious, relation between investigation in biology or zoology and the observation and comparison of these organic forms which we call form of literature and works of art\\", concluding that \\"We study a poem, the work of man's art, in the same way that Agassiz made Shaler study a fish.\\" Critic Robert Scholes concludes that Pound had access to this book and used the material within it as the source for the parable that opens ABC of Reading. Interpretation and criticism =Agassiz= Science historian Mary P. Winsor provides extensive commentary on Agassiz's initial assignments for his students. The solution to the \\"riddle\\", as she calls it, lies in a similar anecdote given by Agassiz in his Essay on Classification: > Suppose that the innumerable articulated animals, which are counted by tens > of thousands, nay, perhaps by hundreds of thousands, had never made their > appearance upon the surface of the globe, with one single exception: that, > for instance, our Lobster (Homarus americanus) were the only representative > of that extraordinarily diversified type,--how should we introduce that > species of animals in our systems? Agassiz provides several potential solutions: the species of lobster could have a single genus \\"by the side of all the other classes with their orders, families, etc.\\", or a family with one genus and one species, or a class with one order and one genus, etc. Agassiz concludes a single species is sufficient to derive the entirety of the hierarchy: at the time, this would have been \\"a distinct genus, a distinct family, a distinct class, a distinct branch.\\" The point of the sunfish is not observing characteristics that distinguish individuals, species and genus, but rather characteristics that are held in common higher up the taxonomic hierarchy. Scudder's observation that finally satisfies Agassiz is that the sunfish has bilateral, paired organs; a characteristic that Winsor notes is common to all vertebrates. =Pound= Pound, echoing Cooper, opens ABC of Reading by stating that the correct method for the study of poetry is \\"the method of contemporary biologists\\" and that \\"No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the fish.\\" Commentators have summarized Pound's position with the term empiricism, but have divided over whether the parable endorses or indicts the idea. The simplest interpretations in scientific writing, history of science, and literary criticism take the parable at face value, accepting empiricism and observation as legitimate techniques. For example, when writing about stellar atmospheres, Dimitri Mihalas states that \\"it is specimens, not facts, that are the ultimate empirical currency that we must use if we wish to purchase a valid theory\\" before beginning a discussion of Pound's sunfish. Moving from acceptance of empiricism to an understanding of its limitations, Christopher Tilley emphasizes in his comments on \\"scientific archeology\\" that Pound's student \\"was not simply learning about 'reality', the sunfish, but a way of approaching that reality ‚Äì a discourse bound up in a particular thought tradition (empiricism)\\". Robert Scholes reaches a similar conclusion, noting that the student \\"seems to be reporting about a real and solid world in a perfectly transparent language, but actually he is learning how to produce a specific kind of discourse, controlled by a particular scientific paradigm\\". Author Bob Perelman takes the suspicion of empiricism one step further in his 1994 The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky. Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in ABC of Reading that frame Pound's discussion of Chinese ideograms. The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts: one of Debussy and another of Ravel. Pound states that a person who attended both concerts knows more about the composers than someone who has only read \\"ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both\\". Perelman considers the contradiction between \\"everyone\\" and \\"knowledge\\" to be the key to Pound's thinking: only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth (whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen); the rest can only make do with \\"a fog of clich√©s, received ideas, second-hand and second-rate opinions, written darkness.\\" With regard to the parable, Perelman observes the lack of \\"scientific institutions, pedagogic procedures, or communicable terminologies\\" where any mediating written descriptions (\\"sunfish\\", \\"diplodokus\\") only serve to obscure knowledge. Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world, and \\"[w]hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism.\\" Two critics have also commented on the parable's implications in describing the nature of knowledge in terms of the decay of Pound's fish. Celeste Goodridge notes that Marianne Moore's 1934 review of Pound's Cantos uses a detailed metaphor of a grasshopper wing to describe the conversations therein. In Goodridge's opinion, Moore's \\"microscopic examination\\" both undercuts the work as well as \\"pays homage, in its precision, to Pound's reverence for 'the applicability of scientific method to literary criticism.'\\" Goodridge then reproduces the parable in full and comments, \\"Agassiz teaches Pound that all knowledge is necessarily fragmented and does not constitute a whole.\\" Knowledge of the fish cannot begin until decay has commenced, reducing the specimen to its constituent parts. Peter Nicholas Baker reaches a fundamentally different conclusion. He begins the discussion of the parable by first quoting Pound on the topic of genius: > The genius can pay in nugget and in lump gold; it is not necessary that he > bring up his knowledge into the mint of consciousness, stamp it either into > the coin of conscientiously analyzed form-detail knowledge or into the paper > money of words before he transmit it. Baker finds the most striking feature of the parable to be the absence of description of the fish. Baker asks: \\"Do readers of this anecdote learn about the fish, or rather about a certain kind of authoritarian teaching practice?\\" Baker claims that Pound's images of coining metal are just as unrealistic as his ideas regarding science and the scientific method. The reader, following Pound's student, reaches knowledge through intuition alone; the decomposing fish, so far as epistemology is concerned, has become \\"transparent\\".

It separates Gr√∂den (to the north) and the Fassa valley (to the south), as well as the Sella massif (to the east) and the Rosengarten (to the west). Northwest of the Langkofel is the Seiser Alm. The highest point in the range is the eponymous Langkofel with a height of 3,181 metres. Taken together, the summits of the Langkofel form an arc which is only open towards the northwest. Within this arc there is only one small mountain, the Langkofelkarspitze, so that the group surrounds a kind of \\"inner courtyard\\".  Geology  The region was formed in the early Triassic period (about 230 million years ago) as a coral reef in a shallow tropical sea. Hard limestone was able to form on the outside of the reef, whilst the rock in the interior remained brittle and was quickly eroded away following the uplifting of the range. This left a garland of mountains which, in a clockwise direction, are the Langkofel, Langkofeleck, F√ºnffingerspitze, Grohmannspitze, Innerkoflerturm, Zahnkofel and Plattkofel.

History The score of Colorines was completed in May 1932 (; ). Although Otto says it was composed in 1933, this cannot be correct, because it was performed on 4 November 1932 at the New School for Social Research, PAAC Chamber Orchestra, Nicolas Slonimsky, conducting . Deane Root, however, gives the year of composition as 1930 (apparently quoting from the programme for that 1932 performance), and also cites a programme given on 30 April 1933 in Havana (Conciertos de la Filarm√≥nica, La Habana, Dos Conciertos de Musica Nueva, Teatro Nacional.) also conducted by Slonimsky, that included Colorines . Programmatic content Color√≠n Color√≠n (plural colorines) is the name of a type of tree, Erythrina americana, or Coral Tree, also called TzompƒÅmitl. The word color√≠n means color chill√≥n‚Äîa ‚Äúgaudy‚Äù or ‚Äúloud‚Äù color . The score of Colorines \\"not only evokes the deep color that the trees of this name give to the landscape, but also the feelings of the Indian women wearing necklaces made of the red and black fruit of this tree, or of children playing with them\\" . Instrumentation The work is scored for a chamber orchestra of piccolo, oboe, E clarinet, B clarinet, one or two bassoons, horn, trumpet, trombone, xylophone, drum, cymbal, bass drum, sonajas (maracas), violins I, violins II, and contrabasses. Analysis Colorines, like most of Revueltas's single-movement works, is constructed in a ternary ABA form, with a fast-slow- fast tempo structure. The arrangement of tempos is a natural consequence of the lyrical development of melodic thematic materials as they progressively unfold the narrative of the work . Reception By the early 1930s it was clear that Mexican audiences preferred compositions in which nationalism was represented not by the pre-Columbian element of Mexican culture, but rather by mestizo, popular music. By this time, Revueltas had developed a style in which, in a collage-like texture, disparate musical elements from Mexico‚Äôs cultural soundscape (the popular, the modern, the urban, the peasant, the Indian, the military, the street life, the market, or the dance) were often juxtaposed so that they often collided. Revueltas did not mean these materials to coexist peacefully. Although the music sometimes celebrates the plurality and vitality of Mexican society, there is audible violence of conflict of cultures, and between premodern and modern social structures. This style was sometimes manifested in a harsh, abstract, and modernist style, and these works, such as Esquinas and Ventanas (both of 1931) were not well received by audiences, but the more lyrical and tonal examples such as Colorines were warmly praised .

Etymology  Kumaon is believed to have been derived from Kurmanchal, meaning land of the Kurmavatar (the tortoise incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the preserver according to Hinduism). The region of Kumaon is named after as such. During the time of the British control of the region, between 1815 and 1857 it was also known as Kemaon.James Prinsep (Editor)John McClelland John Forbes Royle History =Ancient= Kumaon finds mention in the early Hindu scriptures as Manaskhand, according to Skanda Purana the region is believed to be the Birth place of Kurma avtar of Hindu god Vishnu. Prehistoric dwellings and Stone Age implements have been discovered in Almora and Nainital districts. Initially settled by Kol tribals, the region witnessed successive waves of Kiratas, Khasas and Indo-Scythians. Kunindas were the first rulers of the region. =Katyuri dynasty= Around 700CE. Katyuri dynasty established by Vasudev in the region They called their state Kurmanchal, the land of Kurma, the second avatar of Vishnu, from which the present name is derived. capital was Kartikeypura(morden day-Baijnath) and the Gomati Valley came to be known as the Katyur Valley after the ruling dynasty. during their reign they dominated lands of varying extent from the \\"Katyur\\" (modern-day Baijnath) valley in Kumaon, between 7th and 11th centuries C.E., and established their capital at Baijnath in Bageshwar district; which was then known as Kartikeyapura and lies in the centre of \\"Katyur\\" valley. Brahmadev mandi (a trading and business center in a flat area of the then Katyuri dynasty) in the Kanchanpur District of Nepal was established by Katyuris king Brahma Deo. Brahmadeo Mandi still exists by this name. At its peak, the Katyuri dynasty of kumaon extended from Nepal in the east to Kabul, Afghanistan in the west, before fragmenting into numerous principalities by the 12th century. it is believed that from king Dham Deo and Vir Deo the downfall of this powerful dynasty began. Virdeo used to collect heavy taxes and forced his people to work as his slaves, King Virdeo teased his subjects by his tyranny to the extent that he forcibly married his own maternal aunt Tila(Tilottama Devi). It is said that the Kumaoni folk song 'Mami tile dharo bola' became popular from that very day. =Chand dynasty= Fort of chand kings in Champawat the capital of Kumaon kingdom Sometime in the 10th century, the Chand dynasty was established by Som Chand, by displacing the Katyuri Kings. He continued to call his state Kurmanchal, and established its capital in Champawat in Kali Kumaon. The Baleshwar and Nagnath temples were built in this city during the 11th and 12th centuries.History Of Kumaon - Brahmins From Kumaon Hills During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the pahari school of art ) developed.Pande, B. D. (1993). History of Kumaon: English version of \\"Kumaon ka itihas\\". Almora, U.P., India: Shyam Prakashan: Shree Almora Book Depot. =Conflicts and battles= Towards the end of the 17th century, the Kumaon kings attacked Garhwal. In 1688, Udyot Chand, erected several temples at Almora, including Tripur Sundari, Udyot Chandeshwar and Parbateshwar, to mark his victory over Garhwal and Doti. The Parbateshwar temple was renamed twice, to become the present Nanda Devi temple. Gyan Chand, the king of kumaon ascended the throne in 1698. In 1699 he invaded Garhwal, which was under the king Fateh Shah . He crossed Ramganga river and plundered Sabli, Khatli, and Sainchar. In 1701, Fateh shah entered in Chaukot (now Syalde region with 3 part, Talla Chaukot (lower), Malla Chaukot (Upper) and Bichla Chaukot (middle)) and Gewar valley (region of Chaukhutiya, Masi, and Dwarahat) as reply. The Kumaonis defeated the Garhwalis in the battle of Duduli (near Melchauri in Garhwal). In 1707, the Kumaon forces annexed Juniyagarh in Bichla Chaukot (Syalde), and razed the old fort at Chandpur. During the reign of Baz Bahadur Chand the Kumaoni forces invaded Tibet and captured hindu pilgrim Kailash Manasarovar along with several forts.he also built the Golu Devata Temple, at Ghorakhal, near Bhimtal, after Lord Golu, a general in his army, who died valiantly in battle, Few years Later, Jagat Chand (1708‚Äì20), invaded Garhwal, defeated the ruling king of Garhwal and expelled him from Srinagar. After ruling for few years he bestowed the kingdom on a Brahmin. =Nepalese invasion and its defeat= In the latter half of the 18th century, the power of Kumaon was on decline, as the king Mahendra Chand was unable to properly administer the country and conflicts with other neighbouring kingdoms,natural calamities,intrigues and dissensions further weakened the kingdom. Seeing this opportunity, in 1791 the Gorkhas invaded over Kumaon. Gorkha army led by the Gorkha commanders Bahadur shah , kazi Jagjit Pande, Amar Singh Thapa and Sursingh Thapa set to attack kumaon from doti, One regiment went from Kali to Sor, another set out to capture Visung. When the news of the sudden invasion reached Almora, King Mahendra Chand summoned his troops and taking a contingent with him moved towards Gangoli. contingent advanced towards Kali Kumaon. Amar Singh Thapa with his troops attacked the Kumaoni contingent but the forces of king Mahendra chand defeated him and compelled him to turn towards Baitadi, however few hours later gorkha army in large numbers surrounded kumaon from all the direction of west, king mahendra chand fled thus gorkhas finding their path clear reached and captured almora and Kumaon was annexed to Gorkha Kingdom. The Gorkha rule over Kumaon lasted for 24 years, and has been termed as \\"Cruel and Oppressive\\" in a number of texts. The only architectural advancements during the period was a road connecting kali river to Srinagar via Almora. =Kumaon Province= Kumaon as a part of North- Western Provinces in British India, 1857 The Gorkhas were defeated by the East India Company in Anglo-Nepalese War and were forced to cede Kumaon to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816. The Kumaon region was joined with the eastern half of the Garhwal region and was governed as a chief- commissionership, also known as the Kumaon Province, on the non-regulation system.Robert Montgomery Martin, History of the Possessions of the Honourable East India Company, Volume 1, pg. 107 In seventy years it was governed by three successive administrators: Mr. Traill, Mr J. H. Batten and Sir Henry Ramsay. The British set up a small administrative unit to govern the region, known as Patwari Halka.Brief History of the Kumaon Regiment from the official site of the Indian Army Culture =Language= The Kumaoni language is one of the Central Pahari languages. For a number of reasons, Kumaoni usage is shrinking rapidly. UNESCO's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger designates Kumaoni as a language in the unsafe category which requires consistent conservation efforts.

They are found mainly in Bou Sa√¢da, M'Sila and Djelfa, but there is also a significant number of them in Gharda√Øa Origins The oral lore of the Ouled Na√Øl people claims ancient Arab descent from tribes that arrived in the area about a thousand years ago. Some traditions trace their ancestry to the Banu Hilal of Hejaz, who came to the highlands through El Oued, Ghardaia,Nouvelle g√©ographie universelle: la terre et les hommes, Volume 11 Par Elis√©e Reclus (1830-1905), p.552 while others claim that they are direct descendants of Idris I. Traditional lifestyle Traditional women dress of the interior side of Algeria The Ouled Na√Øl are seminomadic or nomadic people living in the highlands of the range of the Saharan Atlas to which they gave their name. The town of Djelfa has been traditionally an important market and trade centre for the Ouled Na√Øl, especially for their cattle. The town has cold and long winters with temperatures averaging 4 ¬∞C. In recent years Djelfa Province has become one of the most populated provinces of Algeria with a population of 1,164,870. Young Ouled Na√Øl woman The Ouled Na√Øl have traditionally reared cattle as nomads in their mountain grasslands, as well in the northern Hodna region and the Dayas in the south. When they are nomadic they live in black-and-red striped tents, but they also used to live in dechra, or non fortified villages, or in ksour, fortified ones. Cereal cultivation is possible in the mountain heights, although with rather irregular results. They rarely were able to cultivate date palms in the heights but obtained dates from other areas by trading, especially in Bou Sa√¢da located at the feet of the northern end of the mountain range. Despite the harsh conditions of the dry and cold highlands where they live, this ethnic group has managed to fare fairly well in their traditional environment along the centuries. However, the odd years of drought and years with prolonged, cold winters are disastrous for the Ouled Nail; in 1944, and again in 1947, when weather conditions were especially rough, about 50% of their livestock died and famines followed. =Dances and songs= The Ouled Na√Øl tribe originated a style of music, sometimes known as Bou Sa√¢da music after the town near their homeland. In belly dancing, the term refers to a style of dance originated by the Ouled Na√Øl, noted for their way of dancing. Although their primary roles and activities in their rural milieu were connected with animal farming, most women trained in the art of dance and song from childhood. Thus for Ouled Na√Øl females the practice of leaving their ancestral home and settling in a nearby desert town as entertainers was common. This was especially so in times of disaster and famine, when a woman had relative freedom to fend for herself in order to survive, save money and improve her future economic status. \\"Exotic\\" representations Painting of the Ouled Na√Øls by L√©on Cauvy (Mus√©e des Ann√©es Trente) The 1956 edition of the Michelin Guide devotes only a few lines to the Ouled Na√Øl mountain region; Djelfa is not even mentioned and the Ouled Na√Øl people are \\"mere courtesans and Oriental dancers\\". French colonialist representations of the Ouled Na√Øl concentrated almost exclusively on women who temporarily left their home and settled in some nearby town.Marnia Lazreg, The Eloquence of Silence: Algerian Women in Question. p. 30-31 However, none of the highland tribes to which they belonged were specialised in prostitution and only some Ouled Na√Øl women became dancers. A British traveller, Lawrence Morgan, gave an account of his experiences living with the Ouled Na√Øl which focuses on the lives of the dancers. title= Flute of Sand, by Lawrence Morgan, publisher=Odhams Press, London, 1956. Still, the exuberance of their ornaments and the exoticism of their costumes added to the general fascination. Auguste Maure, an orientalist photographer that lived in Biskra was active from 1860 to 1907 and took many photographs of landscapes and cities of south Algeria (El Kantara, Sidi Okba, Chetma, Tilatou, Tolga, Touggourt). The female members of the Ouled Na√Øl tribe, wearing the traditional colorful costumes and covered by jewels, were often represented on Maure photographs which were appreciated by tourists.

Since April 6, 2013, he is appearing in a television drama series called Bad Boys J. Personal life On July 31, 2008, the September issue of the tabloid magazine BUBKA published a paparazzi article about Ryosuke Hashimoto spotted at the cinema with Kanna Arihara from the girl group Cute. They went to see the movie Hana Yori Dango: Final. The publication might become the reason for Kanna's disappearance from Cute's activities in early 2009 and her subsequent retirement from the entertainment industry to \\"return to the life of a normal girl\\". Cute fans thought that she was pressured to leave by her talent agency. According to a women's weekly tabloid magazine reporter, the publication itself would not lead to Kanna's retirement, but she continued to date Ryosuke in secret after that. Instead of being punished after the scoop in BUBKA as rumors expected, on August 29, 2008 Ryosuke Hashimoto was added to the Johnny's Jr. group A.B.C., renamed to A.B.C-Z when he joined.

The mountain is known as one of the most important ski centres of the Eastern Ore Mountains. The windswept beech forest on the northeast side of the summit, an area of 3.26 hectares, has been placed under protection since 1979 as a natural monument.  History  The foundation stone for the mountain hut was laid on 15 July 1928. It was built by the Czech Tourist Club (KƒåT). It was used by the Wehrmacht in the Second World War.  Origin of the name  The German and Czech name of the mountain comes from the severe storms (Czech bou≈ôe, German Sturmer) that occur here.  Views  The views are very rewarding. To the north it is somewhat obscured by the crest of the Ore Mountains, but the views to the south, east and west are impressive.

Location and surrounding area  The Bou≈ô≈à√°k lies in the eastern Ore Mountains, 10 kilometres northwest of Teplice and 10 kilometres southwest of Altenberg on a prominent escarpment of the Ore Mountains. At the foot of the mountain is the mining town of Mikulov and the village of Hrob. Immediately next to the shoulder of the mountain, on the crest of the Ore Mountain ridge, is the small settlement of Nov√© Mƒõsto, today purely a resort.  Routes to the summit  * The shortest way to the top runs along the road from Neustadt. Formerly the Old Freiberg to Teplitz Post Road ran along here. * The Bou≈ô≈à√°k offers an extensive range of cross- country skiing trails and downhill runs in winter. There are several prepared trails and lifts. Since 2005 there has been a snowboard fun park.

His attention was drawn to American Jazz an especially the music of John Coltrane, Tal Farlow, Wes Montgomery, Jimmy Raney and Jim Hall was important for his early musical development. Stub√∏ started playing the guitar in an environment of flowering jazz music in Narvik, but moved to Oslo to get his education in the 1960'es. He studied philology at the University of Oslo and got a masters with the German languish as main subject.

Early publications Raskin began writing about technology in the 1980s. Her first technology piece appeared in a 1984 issue of InfoWorld. The article, True Confessions, documented her attraction to technology as an equalizer for women because ultimately it would provide them freedom without shackling them to an office. Raskin became a frequent contributor to Family Computing, a Scholastic publication popular throughout the ‚Äò80s. She frequently tested products, writing stories about raising kids in a digital world, including attempts to empower the younger generation with technology. In 1986, Raskin began contributing to PC Magazine, then a bi-monthly magazine that had been recently purchased by Bill Ziff. Under the tutelage of Editor in Chief, Bill Machrone, Raskin began creating feature stories, including a major comparison of statistical software packages. In 1990, after her three children reached school age, Raskin accepted the job of Senior Editor at PC Magazine and ran the First Looks section of the magazine. From there she became Executive Editor and finally Editor serving under Michael Miller, Editor in Chief. In 1995 Raskin became the Editor in Chief of FamilyPC Magazine, a joint venture between the Disney Publishing Company and Ziff Davis Corporation. Along with founder of Family Fun Magazine, Jake Winebaum, Raskin developed the concept of family-tested products, where real families would live with, review technology and earn the product a family-tested seal of approval. FamilyPC went on to become the premier publication for the technology savvy family. At its height, the magazine grew to a circulation of more than 700,000 readers and was supplemented with exhibits at Disney World‚Äôs Innovations. In 1999 Raskin was named Best Columnist by the Computer Press Association, and also that year she was recognized as one of the top ten tech journalists by MC (Marketing Computers) Magazine. Media appearances and books Over the years, Raskin has appeared regularly on CBS Up to the Minute, CBS This Morning, MSNBC, Fox TV and others as a technology spokesperson, often featured as an expert on kids and technology. Raskin has also authored several book on raising digital Kids including Parents, Kids and Computers (Random House, 1992) with co-author Carol Ellison, Your Child‚Äôs Education (Ziff Davis PR, May 1995) with co-author Kaare Christian, and a series of books based on the FamilyPC family-tested reviews, including the FamilyPC Guide to Cool Projects (Hyperion, September 1996) with co-authors Samuel Mead and Richard Kot, and the Family PC Guide to Homework (Hyperion, September 1996) with co-authors Greg Keizer and Richard Kot. Internet safety Raskin has testified at the COPPA Commission hearings, and has served on the National Academy of Sciences committee investigating kid‚Äôs online safety. The panel was chaired by former attorney general, Dick Thornburgh. Raskin represented the findings in a syndicated media tour for the Academy. Speaking Raskin has made numerous speaking appearances, including at the 2011 SXSW Interactive and InPlay. She also acts as the emcee for her own events: Last Gadget Standing and Mobile Apps Showdown.

Life  Petrus Albinus was born on 18 June 1543 in Schneeberg in the Ore Mountains of central Europe. His father was Peter Weis, who built the Hospital Church in Schneeberg. He was married to Magdalena H√ºbsch, daughter of a Ratsk√§mmerer and mining entrepreneur, who had moved to Schneeberg from Nuremberg. In keeping with the common practice of the day he Latinized his name to Petrus Albinus. After attending grammar school in Schneeberg and princely school at Meissen, Albinus studied in Leipzig, received his bachelor's degree in 1553 and worked in Lauban. In 1559 he moved to the University of Viadrina in Frankfurt/Oder, and in 1564 the Leucorea in Wittenberg. He focused mainly on legal and historical research. Title page of Mei√ünischen Bergk-Chronica, 1590 Illustration from the Mei√ünischen Bergk- Chronica, 1590 In Wittenberg he took over the task of completing the history of Upper Saxony and the House of Wettin begun by Georg Fabricius. For example, in 1579, he indexed the letters and documents of the Bishopric of Meissen. From 1579 to 1588 he was a dean of the University of Wittenberg; in 1586 he took over as Rector and worked until 1588 in Wittenberg. In 1588, Albinus was called to Dresden to be appointed as secretary to Prince-Elector Christian I of Saxony, where he took oversight of all the documents of the Saxon royal house. During his time at Wittenberg, he wrote, in manuscript, a history of his native town of Schneeberg; parts of it were printed as the Chronicle of the Meissen Region and Mountains (Mei√ünische Land- und Bergchronik, 1580‚Äì89), but some parts remained unfinished. Other chronicles were left by him as manuscripts in the archives, for example, those of Altzelle Annaberg, Crimmitschau and Torgau. Several volumes of unpublished collections are preserved in the Dresden Library. Although his research does not meet current scientific standards, his works qualify him as the father of Saxon local history, local history research and historiography. Albinus was married twice. First, in 1576 to Ludmilla Fritsch and, later, in 1584 to Magdalena, a daughter of Samuel Selfisch, with whom he had eight children. He died on 31 July 1598 in Dresden.

Background  The village of Naria is situated in Upper Kagabala Union, in the western end of Maulvibazar Sadar Upazila, 10 km to the west of Maulvibazar, the district headquarters of Maulvibazar District. In 1971, the Maulvibazar District was a sub-division of Sylhet District. The village is surrounded by numerous haors, which makes the village inaccessible during the rains. Country boats remain the sole form of transport to and from the village during the rains. In 1971, the village was inhabited mostly by poor and backward Hindus who made their livelihood through menial labour. On 26 March, the Pakistani occupation army launched the Operation Searchlight and targeted the Hindus for extermination. Thousands of Hindus were killed in the months of March and April and hundreds of thousands of Hindus had taken refuge in India. During this time the local Razakars led by one Madrichh Ali proposed to the villagers of Naria, that they convert en masse and then marry their girls with Muslim boys. The village would thus be saved from the attack of Pakistani occupation army. When the villagers refused, the Razakars asked them to hand over all their cows, to which the villagers refused again. At that, the Razakars threatened them to teach a lesson.  Events  On 5 May, 12 Pakistani soldiers from the Sherpur camp arrived at the village on foot, via the nearby Sadhuhati village. They were accompanied by the President of the Peace Committee of Maulvibazar. Some of the villagers already taken refuge in the nearby Farchha Beel and the others started running for their life, when the Pakistani soldiers arrived in the village. The local collaborators of the Pakistani occupation army, belonging to the Razakars and the Al Badr prevented the villagers from escaping. More than a hundred men, women and children were caught and then brought to the house of Kamini Kumar Deb, a Hindu resident of the village. The women and children were separated from the men and confined to a room. The men, including Kamini Kumar Deb himself, were made to stand in a line and killed by burst fire. After killing the men, the women were raped by the Pakistani soldiers. The local collaborators belonging to the Razakars and the Al Badr set fire to 19 houses and 6 granaries in the village. After the massacre, Naria became a deserted village and the dead bodies lay there without cremation. The skeletons of Kamini Kumar Deb and his wife were recovered from their burnt homestead two days later. As the stench from the dead bodies became unbearable, the Razakars threatened the relatives of the dead to bury the bodies or get killed. After the threats, five or six Hindus from nearby Abdalpur, Noagaon and Khagrakandi villages came and buried the dead bodies in the premises of Kamini Kumar Deb's residence.  Aftermath  After the liberation of Bangladesh, the freedom fighters exhumed the skeletons and brought them to Maulvibazar. After counting the bodies, their skeletons were buried in the bed of the Manu river. After the assassination of Mujibur Rahman, a pre-planned dacoity took place in the house of Kamini Kumar Deb. His descendants sold their house and other properties, except the mass killing site. On 24 May 2011, the International Crimes Tribunal completed their investigations related to the massacre.

His parents were Henry De Meillon (place and years of birth and death are unknown) and Anna Sophia Watts (28 November 1776 ‚Äì 15 June 1863 London). Almost nothing is known about De Meillon's early life, except that his family were from the village of Meillon. This has also not been confirmed. His arrival at Simonstown in the Cape in April or May 1823 was as a result of malaria contracted in Mo√ßambique while serving as second master under Captain Owen aboard , together with the brig Barracouta, 'an expedition for surveying the Eastern Coasts of Africa'. When the expedition returned in 1826, with some 300 new charts, detailing some of coastline, over half the original crew had succumbed to tropical diseases. One of the first references to him was on 21 January 1824 when the South African Commercial Advertiser mentioned him as an 'able draughtsman' who had been commissioned to paint the portraits of Pedu and Teysho, two Bechuana chiefs who were visiting Cape Town. These portraits were included as engravings in the traveller George Thompson's (1796‚Äì1889) book \\"Travels and Adventures in Southern Africa\\" published in 1827. De Meillon tutored the Cloete children at Groot Constantia from May 1825 until August 1825. He was appointed as English teacher in Swellendam. He married twice ‚Äì first to a Miss Grobbelaar/Grobler, the marriage producing two sons, and secondly to Barbara Enslin, producing a second large family. He left the Cape Town area in 1832 and for a while worked as a clerk in Fort Beaufort, and is also recorded in 1842 as being part of the Commissariat in Grahamstown, and working in Port Elizabeth in 1851.

In 2010 Nic was selected for the North Harbour development team and played for the side in that year's ITM Cup. In 2011 he left New Zealand and, with a recommendation from former All Black and current North Harbour forwards coach Craig Dowd, joined Harlequins. Nic broke his ankle in 2011/12 preseason training, but eventually debuted for Quins in the second round of the LV Cup against Sale. He had limited opportunity for first team rugby in his first year with Quins, but was dual-registered to Championship side Esher to gain experience. As his father was born in England, Nic is qualified to play for both England and New Zealand. His brothers, Richard and Mike, both play for Newcastle Falcons and Mike started against Quins in their home fixture against Falcons when Nic made his Aviva Premiership debut from the bench. After three seasons with the Harlequins, Nic returned to Auckland in 2014 and signed with Super Rugby team the Blues, and provincial team North Harbour in the ITM Cup. In 2016, North Harbour won the Mitre 10 Cup Championship final against Otago in Dunedin.

It is listed as category A, the highest grade. History In June 1978 the Highland Regional Council asked Ove Arup & Partners Scotland to prepare a feasibility study for a bridge, in their capacity as consulting civil engineers, and was prepared by March 1979. Construction for the approach roads, costing ¬£4 million, began in summer 1981. Construction of the bridge began in August 1982, with Morrison Construction and Lehane, Mackenzie and Shand the chief contractors. It was constructed by building out the supporting legs and then lifting into place the central span, which had been constructed on land and then moved onto a barge by rail and weighed . The cost of the bridge was ¬£4 million, although was earlier budgeted at ¬£2.75 million. The bridge opened to traffic in July 1984, and was formally opened by the Queen on 8 August 1984. In 2019, the bridge was classified by Historic Environment Scotland as a Category A structure, recognising it as \\"visually striking and technically innovative\\". It was also officially renamed to the Gaelic translation of its name, Drochaid a' Chaolais Chumhaing. Geography The bridge crosses water which is approximately wide and up to deep, leading to fast tidal currents. It replaced the ferry between Kylesku and Kylestrome, which was 400 metres to the east. Design The bridge is 275 metres (902 feet) long with a 79 metre long main span. The bridge deck is at a height of above high water to provide navigation for ships. The bridge deck is supported by V-shaped inclined piers, with eight inclined legs, in order to reduce the length of the main span. The lateral forces from each leg balance, so the total force on the foundations is vertically downwards. The spread of legs supports the bridge in winds which can exceed , and also loads resulting from the curvature of the bridge. There is no joint between the legs and the deck of the bridge, with the expansion joints and bearings being located at the abutments to facilitate straightforward maintenance. The legs are formed from reinforced concrete and the deck from prestressed concrete using cables tensioned at up to 52200 kN. The bridge is designed to be sympathetic to the surrounding country, and the approaches were chosen to minimise changes to the landscape.

She was a pioneer of the use of radioactive isotopes in biology and medicine, notably the techniques of radiocarbon dating and autoradiography. In later life she became a scientific historian, and published a biography of George de Hevesy. Born into a non-religious Jewish family in Frankfurt, Germany, Levi entered the University of Munich in 1929. She carried out her doctoral studies at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem, writing her thesis on the spectra of alkali metal halides under the supervision of and Fritz Haber. By the time she completed it in 1934, the Nazi Party had been elected to office in Germany, and Jews were no longer allowed to be hired for academic positions. She went to Denmark where she found a position at the Niels Bohr Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen. Working with James Franck and George de Hevesy, she published a number of papers on the use of radioactive substances in biology. When the Nazis began rounding up Danish Jews in September 1943, Levi fled to Sweden, where she worked for the biologist John Runnstr√∂m at the Wenner-Gren Institute for Experimental Biology in Stockholm. After the war ended, she returned to Denmark to work at the Zoophysiological Laboratory in Copenhagen. She spent the 1947‚Äì48 academic year in the United States learning about the recently discovered techniques of radiocarbon dating and autoradiography, which she introduced to Europe. She retired from the Zoophysiological Laboratory in 1979, but became involved with the Niels Bohr Archive, where she collected papers of de Hevesy, eventually publishing his biography. Early life Hilde Levi was born in Frankfurt, Germany, on 9 May 1909, the daughter of Adolf Levi, the sales director of a metal company, and his wife Clara (n√©e Reis), the daughter of a printer. Hilde had an older brother called Edwin. She was a gifted musician who learned to play the piano at a young age. During the summers, she would listen to performances at her cousins' summer house in Bavaria by musicians including Elisabeth Schumann and Richard Strauss. Although Jewish, Levi's family did not practise their religion, and were not part of the Jewish community, but when she was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her religion was listed as Jewish. Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she did not wish to attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion. While at high school, Levi decided that she would become a scientist. Her final year was devoted to a physics project on spectra and photography, which became her Oberreal Abiturium. She was the only girl in her class to major in physics that year. After her graduation in April 1928, her father sent her to England for six months to learn English. She entered the University of Munich in 1929, where she listened to lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld. For her doctorate, she was accepted into the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem, where she wrote her thesis on the spectra of alkali metal halides, under the supervision of Peter Pringsheim and Fritz Haber. Nazi period By the time Levi received her doctorate in 1934, the Nazi Party had been elected to office in Germany. Her supervisors had gone into exile, and Jews were no longer allowed to be hired for academic positions. The Danish branch of the International Federation of University Women helped Levi find a position at the Niels Bohr Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Niels Bohr asked James Franck, another refugee from Germany, if he knew Levi, and would be willing to have Levi as his assistant. Franck replied that he did not know her personally, but he knew her thesis, and rated it highly. She became engaged to the physicist Hans Bethe in 1934. The two had known each other since 1925. However, his mother, although herself Jewish, was opposed to her son marrying a Jewish girl, and he broke off the engagement a few days before the wedding was to take place. Bethe's action shocked Franck and Bohr. Although an eminent physicist, Bethe would not be invited to visit the Niels Bohr Institute until after the Second World War. Levi never married, but became friends with many of the physicists who did visit the Institute, including Otto Frisch, George Placzek, Rudolf Peierls, Leon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller and Victor Weisskopf. Levi worked as Franck's assistant, publishing two papers with him on the fluorescence of chlorophyll, until he left Denmark for the United States in 1935. She then became assistant to the Hungarian physical chemist George de Hevesy. The recent discovery of induced radioactivity and the consequent creation of short-lived radioactive isotopes opened up a number of new uses for radioactive substances in biology which she explored with de Hevesy, publishing a number of papers with him. The University of Berlin cancelled Levi's doctorate in 1938. In April 1940, the Germans occupied Denmark. When the Nazis began rounding up Danish Jews in September 1943, Levi was one of the thousands of Jews who fled to Sweden. For the rest of the war she worked for the biologist John Runnstr√∂m at the Wenner-Gren Institute for Experimental Biology in Stockholm. Later life When the war ended, de Hevesy elected to stay in Sweden, and Bohr decided to drop biological research at the Institute and return to concentrating on physics. Levi accepted a position at the Zoophysiological Laboratory in Copenhagen, under August Krogh, who, like Bohr, had won a Nobel Prize. She spent the 1947‚Äì48 academic year in the United States as a Fellow of the American Association of University Women. While there, she learned from Willard Libby at the University of Chicago about his recently discovered technique of radiocarbon dating. She developed the new technique of autoradiography while working for the United States Atomic Energy Commission at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. On returning to Denmark, she worked with the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen to develop radiocarbon dating equipment. This was put to the test in 1951, dating the Grauballe Man. Autoradiography was then used by the Finsen Institute to investigate the effects of the radiocontrast agent thorotrast. Levi was a consultant at the Danish National Board of Health from 1952 to 1970. Levi retired from the Zoophysiological Laboratory in 1979, but became involved with the Niels Bohr Archive, where she collected papers from de Hevesy. The result of this work was a biography of Hevesy, which was published in 1985. That year she organised the Niels Bohr Centennial Exhibition at the Copenhagen Town Hall. In 2001 she was honoured by Humboldt University of Berlin, along with other students who had been dismissed in 1933. She died in Copenhagen on 26 July 2003.

It was similar to the geographical area now encompassed by the current provinces of West Java, Banten and Jakarta. A Pasundan Republic () was declared on 4 May 1947 but was dissolved later that year. On 26 February 1948, the State of West Java (Negara Jawa Barat) was established and, on 24 April 1948, the state was renamed Pasundan. Pasundan became a federal state of the United States of Indonesia in 1949 but was incorporated into the Republic of Indonesia (itself also a constituent of the USI) on 11 March 1950.http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/id-4550.html In 2009, there was a proposal to rename the present West Java province Pasundan (\\"Province of the Sundanese\\") after the historical name for West Java.\\"Tokoh Jawa Barat siapkan deklarasi Provinsi Pasundan.\\" Okezome.com News. 29 October 2009.  Background  =Indonesian developments= On 17 August 1945, Sukarno proclaimed the independence of Indonesia, which had been a Dutch colony, and then had been occupied by the Japanese since 1942. The Dutch wished to retain control, and an armed conflict broke out. In November 1946, following international pressure, the Indonesians and Dutch signed the Linggadjati Agreement, in which the Dutch recognized Indonesian de facto authority over Java and Sumatra and both sides agreed to cooperate in the establishment of a United States of Indonesia comprising the Republic, Borneo and eastern Indonesia. However the Dutch began creating federal states unilaterally, beginning with the State of East Indonesia in December 1946. By July 1947, the cost to the Dutch of maintaining military forces in Indonesia and the desire to regain access to the resources of Java and Sumatra led the decision to attack the Republic. At midnight on 30 July 1947, the Dutch launched a \\"Police Action\\", and took control of West Java and Madura as well as the areas around Semarang, Medan and Palembang. = Suriakartalegawa's State of Pasundan = The first attempt at establishing an independent State of Pasundan was by a Sundanese aristocrat named Musa Suriakartalegawa, who later claimed that it was at the suggestion of the political adviser to Dutch East Indies Lieutenant Governor Hubertus van Mook. He began laying the foundations of the state by establishing the Pasundan People's Party (Partai Rakyat Pasundan, PRP) on 18 November 1946, with Raden Sadikin as the chairman of the party. The party itself was established as a response to the lack of Sundanese representation in the Malino Conference and Pangkalpinang Conference. Using the party as the base of support, Suriakartalegawa established the State of Pasundan in the small areas of West Java still controlled by the Dutch. Independence was proclaimed on 4 May 1947. Dutch military forces provided trucks to transport people to the proclamation site and during the ceremony, Dutch military police officers presented attendees with Pasundan flags and bread to encouragement them to parade in support of the state. Suriakartalegawa appointed himself as the president and Koestomo as the prime minister in a provisional government. The Dutch supported Suriakartalegawa by providing facilities such as the press and radio, while the Enlightenment Service of the Dutch helped to spread propaganda pamphlets of the PRP. The establishment of the state was denounced by Sundanese aristocrats and commoners and did not lessen people's support for the Republic of Indonesia. Wiranatakusumah and his family sent out a wire to Sukarno on 6 May 1947 that opposed the establishment of the State of Pasundan. Public meetings were held throughout West Java to oppose the formation of the state, and the Indonesian army in Garut announced IDR 10,000 bounty for the capture of Suriakartalegawa, either dead or alive. Suriakartalegawa's son and mother spoke out against the formation of the state on the Indonesian Radio Republik Indonesia. Following press reports of the farcical nature of the state, and noticing the lack of support for it, the Netherlands Government Information Service withdrew its support. Suriakartalegawa's state practically disappeared after the July 1947 Dutch \\"Police Action\\". The establishment of Pasundun convinced the Republican side of the Dutch intention to \\"divide and rule\\" and maintain their control over Indonesia. = West Java Conferences = Following the \\"Police Action\\", the Dutch authorities established an organization to administer the areas they had gained control over. This was headed by Government Commissioners for Administrative Affairs (). The West Java Recomba organized a series of conferences involving various groups in West Java establish a new State of Pasundan. Three conferences were held, all in the city of Bandung. The first conference was held from 13 until 18 November 1947. It was attended by 50 delegates from all of the regions of West Java and discussed matters regarding the government of the State of Pasundan, the integration between Dutch and Indonesian officials, and efforts to restore peace and security in West Java. The conference managed to form a liaison committee between the Dutch and the Indonesian officials, headed by Hilman Djajadiningrat (then Governor of Jakarta). The next conference was held a month later, from 16 until 20 December 1947. A larger number of delegates (170 delegates) attended. Instead of representing the Sundanese people only, the delegates also came from minorities in West Java (Chinese, Arabic, Europeans, Indo people). Five more people were appointed to the liaison committee, three of which represented minorities. The liaison committee was renamed the preparatory committee. There were three opinions regarding the formation of the State of Pasundan. The majority of the delegates opted to establish a definitive government, while the others (mainly pro-Indonesian) opted for transitional government or refused to form a government until a referendum was held. Three motions were submitted to the conference by the delegates. Even though these motions had differences, they were seen as all having a common aim, and following negotiations, they were combined in the form of a resolution stating that the next conference should form a provisional government for West Java with a parliament. In January 1948, following international pressure, Indonesian Republicans and the Dutch signed the Renville Agreement, which recognized Dutch authority over Indonesia pending the handing over of sovereignty to a United States of Indonesia (USI), of which the Republic of Indonesia would be one component. Regions would be given the option to decide whether to join the USI or the Republic of Indonesia. The agreement also led to the division of Java into areas of Dutch and Republic of Indonesia control separated by a ceasefire line known as the van Mook Line. The Pasundan region was within the Dutch-controlled area. The final West Java conference, the third, was held from 23 February until 5 March 1948. Of the 100 delegates, 53 were chosen by indirect election, and 43 appointed by the Dutch. Most of these delegates were pro-Indonesia, and a particularly vocal nationalist minority expressed its opposition to the establishment of a separate state without a referendum - as specified in the Renville Agreement. At this conference, republican R. A. A. Wiranatakusumah, who had served in Indonesia's first cabinet, was narrowly elected head of state, or wali negara, and the head of the pro-republican faction, Adil Poeradiredja, was elected prime minister. The delegates to the conference subsequently became the Pasundan parliament. Establishment of the State of Pasundan On 26 February 1948, the Dutch East Indies government expressed approval of the resolution establishing a provisional West Java government, subsequently renamed Pasundan, and the state came into being. The cabinet was sworn in on 8 May. The Indonesians supporting the state were those dissatisfied with their positions within the Republic of Indonesia or who believed that the republic would not survive and wanted to protect the interests of the ethnic Sundanese people within a Sundanese state in a Dutch-supported federal state. However, support for the Indonesian Republic was so strong among the members of the parliament and the cabinet, that the Dutch authorities in Batavia felt obliged to control many aspects of Pasundan life and restrict civil liberties, including the right of assembly. Some powers were transferred to the Pasundan government, but these were severely limited, and the Dutch even kept control of secondary and higher education, as well as the radio, newspapers and information offices. On 19 December 1948, the Dutch launched a second \\"Police Action\\" against the areas controlled by the Republic. Dutch forces captured the republican capital, Yogyakarta and detailed President Sukarno. In protest, the Padundan cabinet, along with the cabinet of the largest federal state, the State of East Indonesia, resigned, to the embarrassment of the Dutch, who had planned a conference to discuss the form of the federal Indonesian state. Prime Minister Adil Poeradiredja refused to form a new cabinet, and its 6-member replacement was formed by Djumhana Wiriaatmadja. However, the new cabinet's anti-Dutch stance angered the Batavia administration, which threatened to arrest key members of the government and install a military government. Four members of the cabinet subsequently resigned, as did Djumhana on 28 January 1949. He then formed a cabinet more acceptable to the Dutch. In early March 1949, Prime Minister Djumhana was part of the Federal Consultative Assembly delegation, representing the non-Republican Indonesian states, that took part in negotiations with Indonesian president Sukarno and other senior officials on the island of Bangka, where Sukarno had been exiled by the Dutch. Both parties to these negotiations, together with the Dutch, then took part in the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference in the Hague from August to November. This conference led to the Dutch transferring sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia, with Pasundan as one component of it, on 27 December. Dissolution The Dutch-sponsored Pasundan government was never in control of the entire area that officially constituted the state. At the time of its establishment, around 25 percent of the area was in the hands of Islamic anti-Dutch groups, including Darul Islam. Even following the second Dutch \\"police action\\" launched against the Republic in December 1948, only one third of the state was controlled by the Dutch. On 23 January 1950, Raymond Westerling's Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA) launched a coup attempt. They occupied key locations in Bandung and then headed for Jakarta to attack the United States of Indonesia Cabinet. The coup failed, but the fact that the it had been launched from Pasundan, and that several Pasundan leaders were arrested for their involvement severely damaged the credibility of the state. On 9 February, a day after the USI cabinet passed an emergency law transferring the authority of the Pasundan government to a State Commissioner for Pasundan, Wiranatakusumah handed over his powers. The following month, Pasundan and a number of other states requested they be merged into the Republic of Indonesia. On 11 March 1950 the state of Pasundan became part of the Republic and ceased to exist as a separate entity.

From 1560 to 1580, he was co-monarch along with his father and from 1580 to 1614, he ruled on his own. His reign is generally regarded as one of peace and stability.  Personal life  Achuthappa Nayak was the eldest son of Sevappa Nayak, the Vijayanagar feudatory of Arcot who founded the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty. His principal queen was Murtimamba.  Names  Achuthappa Nayak was named by Sevappa Nayak after the Vijayanagar Emperor Achyuta Deva Raya. During his lifetime, Achuthappa Nayak was also known as Chinna Seva Achyutha and Sevappa Achyutha.  Reign  Achuthappa ruled for a total of 54 years during which Thanjavur experienced architectural and cultural development. While the earlier part of his reign was peaceful, there was warfare with Muslim and Portuguese invaders towards the end. He maintained peaceful relations with the Vijayanagar kings and assisted them in their campaigns. Achuthappa was assisted by his minister, the legendary Govinda Dikshitar. = Battle of Vallamprakara = In 1579, the Madurai Nayak king Virappa Nayak declared his independence from Vijayanagar. Achuthappa fought Virappa along with the Vijayanagar Emperor Venkata II at Vallamprakara (the present-day Vallam near Thanjavur) and defeated him. This battle is not mentioned in any of Achuthappa's own inscriptions and the only references to this war are found in the Pudukkottai plates of Adivirarama Srivallabha and Varathungarama, both dated 1583. The validity of these plates have since been questioned as Venkatapathi did not ascend the throne till 1586. = Campaign against the Portuguese = The Sahityaratnakara describe Achuthappa's victory over Parasikas at Nagapattinam. Ramabadramba too refers to the campaign but names Achuthappa's enemies as \\"Parangi\\", the Tamil word used for colonial Europeans. During the early 17th century, the Portuguese were waging a concentrated campaign to conquer Jaffna and Achuthappa's attack on Nagapattinam might have been launched to assist the king of Jaffna. To supplant the Portuguese, Achuthappa also maintained friendly relations with the Dutch towards the end of his reign. = Art and architecture = On the whole, however, the kingdom progressed during Achuthappa's reign. Achuthappa built the Thiraikattuvar Mandapam in the Vilanagar temple in 1608 and made generous land grants to the Margasahayeshwara Temple at Muvalur near Mayiladuthurai, Thirumulasthana Temple at Chidambaram and Panaipakkam Temple. The Sangitha Sudha says that Achuthappa Nayak was an ardent devotee of the Hindu god Ranganatha right from his boyhood. Achuthappa constructed the golden vimana and gopuras around the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam and constructed the flight of steps leading to the Cauvery. He constructed Pushyamantapas to feed poor Brahmins in the towns of Mayiladuthurai, Thiruvidaimarudur, Kumbakonam and Tiruvadi. He also constructed a dam across the Cauvery near the town of Tiruvadi in order to facilitate irrigation and endowed agraharas all over the kingdom. Literature flourished during his reign. The works Sahityaratnakara and Raghunathabyudayam give a detailed picture of life in the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom. They describe the whole kingdom as a \\"paddy forest\\" (Salivanam).  Later life  According to sources, Achuthappa abdicated following the death of the Vijayanagar Emperor Venkatapathi in 1614 and anointed his son Raghunatha Nayak as the next ruler. According to the Sahityaratnakara, Achuthappa retired to Srirangam upon abdication spending the rest of his life discoursing with Hindu scholars. The Raghunathabyudayam says that Raghunatha Nayak approached Achuthappa to seek his blessings after the Battle of Toppur in 1617. It is assumed that Achuthappa must have died after that date.

History The field was discovered in 1982 and it was named after Russian geologist Vladimir Beregovoi. It was to be developed by Sibneftegaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom. However, in late 1990s Gazprom lost control over Sibneftegaz and the main shareholder became Itera. The second largest shareholder became the Russian fertilizer producer Acron Group. The field was ready for production in 2003; however, commercial production started only in 2007 after change in its ownership structure as Gazprom did not allowed produced gas to enter into the gas transportation system. In 2006, Gazprom through its banking arm Gazprombank bought back controlling stake (51%) in Sibneftegaz from Itera and commercial production started after that. In 2009, Itera bought Acron Group 21% stake in Sibneftegaz. In December 2010, Novatek bought a 51% stake in Sibneftegaz from Gazprombank. Reserves It has reserves of of natural gas, 0.991 million tonnes of gas condensate, and 9.035 million tonnes of crude oil.

Shape Arts partners with major cultural institutions to create positive change for disabled people by improving access, exposure and opportunities in contemporary art. History Shape was founded by Gina Levete MBE in 1976 with project funding from the Gulbenkian Foundation. Tony Heaton OBE was CEO from 2008-2017, the current CEO is David Hevey Shape was informed by the political activism of the 60s. Disability arts grew out of the disability rights movement, and the wider struggle by disabled people for equality and the right to participate in all aspects of society. Activities Their mission is to remove barriers to creative excellence by providing skills, opportunities and support for disabled artists, individuals and cultural organisations; and help build a more inclusive cultural sector. It does this through a variety of programmes: *The Shape Open: an annual exhibition of artwork by disabled and non-disabled artists created in response to a disability-centred theme. Usually held in a high-profile, artist-led spaces. *Unlimited: an arts commissioning programme offering talented disabled artists funds and mentoring support to develop, produce and show ambitious work. Delivered in partnership with Artsadmin. *NDACA the 'National Disability Arts Collection and Archive': a ¬£1-million digital archive chronicling the history of disability arts in the UK. *Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary: flagship art award, designed to support a mid- career disabled artist or artists, looking to develop their practice and build their profile by offering funds and a three month residency at a high-profile arts venue. *Shape Collection: an expanding collection currently holding over 20 works on long term or permanent loan, it includes sculptural pieces by the late Adam Reynolds, and the Incarnate photographic series by Tom Shakespeare. Other artists include Jason Wilsher-Mills, Caroline Cardus, James Lake and Tony Heaton OBE. Shape Arts arranges exhibitions, awards bursaries to promising disabled artists and provides training in media and marketing skills.

Notable artists *Yinka Shonibare CBE, now Patron of their annual Shape Open, is a disabled artist who worked as an arts development officer at Shape in the 90s. Shonibare acknowledges the role that Shape Arts played in his early career: \\"I worked for Shape three days a week, running workshops on singing, dancing or visual arts for disabled and older people in day centres and hospitals. The job meant I could afford to rent a studio and it gave me organisational and fundraising skills.\\" In 2013, Shonibare was announced as patron of the annual Shape 'Open' exhibition where disabled and non-disabled artists are invited to submit work in response to a disability focused theme. *Guy Evans, a founding member of Echo City, is a progressive rock drummer with Subterraneans who worked at Shape Arts in an administrative role and as a workshop leader. *Kelly Knox, one of Britain's leading disabled fashion models, worked at Shape Arts for a number of years as a programme co- ordinator. Financial Support Renowned British contemporary artists have donated artworks to Shape to raise money for the charity through an auction at Bonhams. Funds raised from the sale were matched by the Arts Council‚Äôs Catalyst Arts Fund and went towards supporting new arts activities and opportunities for disabled people. Works by Jake and Dinos Chapman, Mat Collishaw, Angela de la Cruz, Tacita Dean, Sir Antony Gormley, Marc Quinn and David Shrigley were auctioned at Bonhams London on 4 March 2014.

Nayak was a feudatory of the Vijayanagar Empire and the governor of Thanjavur who founded the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom. He reigned from 1532 to 1560.  Ancestry and personal life Sevappa was the successor of his father was a Thimappa Nayak (Or) called Thimmabuban. The family hailed from Nedungundram near Thiruvannamalai. Sevappa is also Worked as to be a Vaasal Karar of the Vijayanagar Emperor, Achyuta Deva Raya, the younger brother of Krishnadeva Raya for the Telugu histories Tanjavuri Andhra Rajula Charitramu and Tanjavuri Vari Charitram claim that Sevappa got Thanjavur as stri-danaor dowry. However, this opinion is not universally held by scholars.  Campaigns  Records indicate that Sevappa was a loyal vassal of the Vijayanagar kings and assisted them in their campaigns. Sevappa was the honorary \\"betel-bearer\\" (Adappam in Tamil and Tambula Karandavahin in Sanskrit) of Achyuta Deva Raya.  Reign  Sevappa's epigraphs are very few and there exist scarcely any record of his reign or campaigns outside the Chola country. One of the earliest events of his reign was the transfer for Tiruchirappalli to the Madurai Nayak kingdom in exchange for Vallam. When the Vijayanagar general Ramaraja Vithala stationed himself and his army in Tiruchirappalli during his wars against the king of Tiruvadi and the Paravas of the south in 1545, Sevappa provided him with men and support.  Grants and public works  Sevappa constructed a number of Hindu temples, repaired tanks and endowed agraharas. Sevappa repaired the outer walls of the Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur and ensured regular supply of water to the neighbouring Sivaganga Tank (now within the premises of the Sivaganga Park). In 1572, Sevappa Nayak constructed the gopuraof the Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram and embellished the temples at Thirumala and Srisailam with gold. He also granted seven velis of land to the Samusarupalli mosque near Nanjikottai in 1550 and a village to the Madhva saint Vijayendra Tirtha in 1574. In 1579, he grant vast lands to the Buddhist temple at Thiruvilandurai. Sevappa also patronized Portuguese merchants. A biography of Francis Xavier from Nagapattinam says that the Portuguese \\"were greatly favoured by the lord of the country who is a very powerful captain of the king of Bisnaga\\".  Later life  In his later days, Sevappa appointed his son Achuthappa Nayak as co-ruler. In about 1563, Sevappa handed over authority in administrative matters to him and concentrated on acts of charity. Sevappa died in 1580 and was succeeded by Achuthappa.

Synopsis  The play is set in Venice in 1355. Marino Faliero, recently elected Doge of Venice, offends one of the chief officers of state, Michele Steno. Steno retaliates by writing on the Doge's throne an indecent libel on Faliero's wife. For this he is tried by the Council of Forty and convicted, but is only sentenced to a month's imprisonment. Faliero is so outraged by this, as he believes it to be an inadequate punishment for such an affront to the ruling Doge, that he secretly joins in the conspiracy of a group of malcontents to abolish the constitution of Venice, thinking thereby to gain revenge on his enemies. The plot is discovered and Faliero is executed.  Composition and publication  Byron was inspired to take on this subject when, on examining the portraits of the Doges in the Palazzo Ducale in Venice, he discovered that the portrait of Faliero had been blacked out. The main historical source he drew on was Marino Sanuto's Vite dei Dogi (published posthumously 1733). He completed the play in July 1820, by which time he was living in Ravenna, and published it in April 1821, along with his The Prophecy of Dante. He intended to dedicate it to Goethe, but delays in the post between Italy and England resulted in the play being published without a dedication. The posthumous 1832 edition of Byron's collected works included a later dedication of the play by Byron to his friend Douglas Kinnaird. Marino Faliero was translated into French in 1830 and into Italian in 1838.  First performance  Byron intended his play to be read rather than acted, and when he heard that the actor-manager Robert William Elliston intended to stage it he caused his publisher, John Murray, to obtain an injunction to prevent him. Elliston nevertheless performed it, in a version cut almost by half, at Drury Lane four days after the play was published. The reaction from both audiences and critics was lukewarm; perhaps, as Byron thought, because of the play's neoclassical form and lack of sensationalism and love interest.  Influence  Delacroix, 1825‚Äì26) The subject of Eug√®ne Delacroix' painting The Execution of the Doge Marino Faliero (1825‚Äì26), now in the Wallace Collection in London, was suggested by Byron's play. A tragedy by Casimir Delavigne on the same subject is believed to have drawn on Byron, as well as on a story by E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Delavigne's play itself inspired Donizetti's opera Marino Faliero. Swinburne was impelled to write his own Marino Faliero by what he considered shortcomings in Byron's play.

Thin boundaries are associated with open-mindedness, sensitivity, vulnerability, creativity, and artistic ability. People with thin boundaries may tend to confuse fantasy and reality and tend to have a fluid sense of identity, so that they tend to merge or lose themselves in their relations with others. People with thick boundaries differentiate clearly between reality and fantasy and between self and other, and tend to prefer well-defined social structures. The concept was developed by psychoanalyst Ernest Hartmann from his observations of the personality characteristics of frequent nightmare sufferers. The construct has been particularly studied in relation to dream recall and lucid dreaming. Thin and thick boundaries Dr. Ernest Hartmann observed that people who suffer frequent nightmares had distinctive personality characteristics he described as \\"unguarded\\", \\"undefended\\", \\"vulnerable\\", \\"artistic\\", and \\"open\\". People with these characteristics seem unable to screen out frightening images and feelings originating in their dreams. They also lack barriers between their own identity and those of others, or between their own beliefs and unconventional ideas. Hartmann proposed that such people have \\"thin\\" boundaries between their mental processes and argued that thinness or thickness of boundaries was \\"a broad dimension of personality and an aspect of the overall organization of the mind.\\" He considered the concept to be similar to William James' concept of \\"tender-mindedness\\" and to Blatt and Ritzler's \\"permeable ego boundaries\\". The construct is measured with the Boundary Questionnaire which assesses thinness of boundaries in relation to a variety of areas, including boundaries between sleeping and waking, thoughts and feelings, and persons, places, and values. People with thick boundaries tend to see the world in \\"black-and- white\\" terms, whereas those with thin boundaries tend to be more aware of \\"shades of gray\\". Women tend to have thinner boundaries than men, and boundaries tend to become thicker with age. Measurement The Boundary Questionnaire consists of 145 five-point scales covering the following 12 areas: Additionally, a total score (SumBound) reflecting boundary thinness was derived by summing the ratings of 138 items. Relationship to other personality traits The Boundary Questionnaire has been related to the Five Factor Model of personality, and \\"thin boundaries\\" are mostly associated with openness to experience, particularly the facets of openness to fantasy, aesthetics, and feelings, although some of the content was correlated with neuroticism, extraversion, and low conscientiousness. Scores on the questionnaire are also positively correlated with absorption, transliminality, hypnotisability, and suggestibility. Thin boundaries are also associated with the Feeling and Intuition scales of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. Psychopathology Persons diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder or with borderline personality disorder tend to have thinner boundaries than the rest of the population, whereas people with obsessive-compulsive disorder tend to have thicker boundaries. On the MMPI thin boundaries are associated with high scores on the paranoia scale, and in males with high femininity and low defensiveness. Thin boundaries in males are therefore associated with willingness to accept \\"feminine\\" aspects of the self, whereas men with thick boundaries recognize that \\"men are men, women are women\\". Dreaming One study has found that people with thin boundaries have more frequent dream recall, have more nightmares, and may also have longer, more intense dreams, with more bizarre content. Additionally, people with thin boundaries tend to value their dreams more, especially their meaningfulness and creative aspects. People with thin boundaries are more likely to report having had childhood nightmares, suggesting that boundary thinness may be relatively stable across the lifespan. New age beliefs Adherence to new age beliefs and practices, such as yoga, reiki, divination, and astrology, is positively correlated with thin boundaries as well as with measures of schizotypy and magical thinking. New age beliefs and thin boundaries may be related through such shared factors as a sense of \\"connectedness\\", holism and emotional sensitivity, as well as a thinking style defined by looseness of association.

At the end of the school term (usually in July), local pupils and adult citizens take part in many Rutenfest events including a parade watched by tens of thousands of spectators. Rutenfest is generally considered the high spot of Ravensburg's city life. Alumni of local schools flock back to their hometown, to meet family and friends at the events officially organized by the Rutenfest Commission, and at hundreds of private parties.  Etymology  Rutenfest on an 1873 painting Rutentheater in 2006 The Rutentrommler drumming group Champion marksman at the Adlerschiessen in 2004 There are several folk festivals in South Germany that bear the name \\"Rutenfest\\", notably those in Ravensburg and Landsberg am Lech (the latter spelled Ruethenfest), and a smaller festival in Bopfingen. Several explanations of the name have been brought forward over the years. Most likely, birch whips used for beating the pupils were a symbol of mastering Latin grammar, and pupils were solemnly awarded with such a birch at the end of each school term. Those birches were cut in the woods around town in some sort of a school outing before the festival.  Traditions  Rutenfest Ravensburg goes back to the 17th century, the custom of \\"going (to/with) the birches\\" being first mentioned in a municipal law in 1645. Rutenfest is celebrated from the last Friday of school term (\\"Ruten Friday\\") over a long weekend until Tuesday (\\"Ruten Tuesday\\"). On \\"Ruten Monday\\", most shops and offices in Ravensburg are closed. Schools are closed on Monday and Tuesday. During all Rutenfest days, funfair attractions (including a large mobile ferris wheel), beer gardens, beer tents and food stands are open to the public in an area north of the old town called Kuppelnau. While Rutenfest Ravensburg features several elements of Volksfests with beer gardens and funfairs like the much larger Munich Oktoberfest, it boasts a lot of local traditions that distinguish it from other German town festivals. The citizens of Ravensburg celebrate their town with thousands of flags (in blue and white, the town's colors) that can be seen all over the town, and with a lot of local patriotism. The local anthem Mein Ravensburg im Schwabenland (My Ravensburg in the country of Swabia) is sung at all official events, and often spontaneously in beer gardens. All official events are heralded with three cannon salutes from the town's highest watchtower, the medieval Mehlsack. These salutes can be heard across the whole town. = Award ceremonies = The oldest tradition still performed at today's Rutenfest is the solemn presentation of an award for the best female and male pupils. The tradition can be traced back to the 17th century. The awards are presented during the second of two large events at the multi-purpose hall Oberschwabenhalle that also feature dance, sport and music performances by local schools. The laureates are called \\"Oberstk√∂niginnen‚Äú and \\"Oberstf√§hnriche\\" and take part in the Monday Parade. In 2013, the tradition was changed: not only pupils of elementary secondary schools, but students of all schools are now eligible for these traditional honors. The pupils are no longer those with the best grades but those that have the best record in extracurricular activities and involvement in school life.http://www.schwaebische.de/region/oberschwaben/ravensburg/stadtnachrichten- ravensburg_artikel,-Wie-die-Politik-das-Rutenfest-veraendert- _arid,5425767.html The tradition that the pupils wear 18th-century style dresses and uniforms during the ceremony and at the parade was abolished. Hence the group has been the only one in the 2013 parade that was not wearing historical costumes but rather unsightly T-shirts and sweaters. = Rutentheater = Occasional theatre performances have been held during Rutenfest from at least 1697. Since 1821, local schools have been presenting plays and declamations, which means that Rutentheater has one of the longest traditions in German amateur theatre. Since 1898, Rutentheater is held at the sumptuous Konzerthaus theatre. , two casts of 50 pupils (plus a pupils' wind orchestra and ballet dancers) present a fairytale production in a total of 17 performances (with c. 500 patrons each) starting one week before \\"Ruten Friday\\". The performances are usually sold out well in advance. = Drumming groups = Over the Rutenfest days (from Friday until Tuesday), several bands in historic costumes are marching through the city playing drums and fifes, pipes or fanfares. The groups play two or three pieces at the homes of dignitaries, former group members, and friends (a custom called Antrommeln). In return, the groups are rewarded with donations to compensate their expenses, and are sometimes invited to food and drink. Around these short performances, many citizens organize garden or street parties where their friends and old classmates are also invited. Since the drumming starts as early as 7am and stops only at 10pm, some drumming can nearly always be heard at any point in town during Rutenfest. Some of the drumming groups are formed by pupils to represent their schools and can only be seen during the Rutenfest days: *Rutentrommler, drumming group of pupils of lower secondary schools (Hauptschule), first mentioned in the 17th century. The Rutentrommler are the only drumming group that consists of both boys and girls (since 1994).http://www.rutentrommler.de/geschichte.html *The Trommlerkorps der Gymnasien is a drumming group of male grammar school (Gymnasium) pupils founded c. 1865. Twelve drummers and twelve flag bearers (called Charge) are elected by their male classmates a couple of months before the Rutenfest. Three senior officers are elected by last year's members: the Rutenhauptmann delivers several public speeches at official events and organizes the Trommlerball dance ball, the Adjutant organizes the Adlerschiessen competition, and the Tambourmajor is responsible for the drumming. These three seniors also appoint four Vortrommler (senior drummers) and three Zugf√ºhrer (responsible for the marching order) from the members of last year's group. *The Landsknechte, a drum and fife group of male 11th grade grammar school pupils, were founded in 1900. Three drummers, nine fifers and thirteen Tross members are elected by their male classmates. Three senior officials are elected by last year's members: the Fahnenschwinger (standard bearer/flag spinner) and two Begleiter (adjutants). The Landsknechte wear colorful Renaissance-style Landsknecht costumes. *Sch√ºtzentrommler, drumming group of male Realschule secondary school pupils, founded in 1967 *Fahnenschwingertruppe St. Konrad, drum and fife group of male pupils of the Catholic School Centre St. Konrad, founded in 1979. The group features ten flag spinners who bear flags with the coats of arms of Ravensburg and other former Imperial cities. Former members of the pupils' drumming groups (Ehemalige) usually keep the hat of their costumes and wear this hat lifelong during the festival. Ehemalige are organized in clubs and organize various parties and events during the Rutenfest and at other times of the year. There are also several drumming groups of male grown-up citizens that are exclusively heard at Rutenfest: *Altentrommler (\\"senior drummers\\"), a drumming group that only performs every five years when the Altenschiessen takes place (the years known as Altsch√ºtzenjahr). The origins of the group can be traced to 1906 when a group of respected citizens that called themselves Protesttrommler protested against the decision of the local grammar school headmaster to hold classes on Ruten Monday and Ruten Tuesday. They borrowed drums from a local sports club, marched to the school and started to drum, which made it impossible to continue with the teaching. In 1907, they repeated this demonstration. From 1908, both days were holidays for the pupils again. From 1910, several of the Protesttrommler members formed the new Altentrommler. Since then, the group has been a part of every Altsch√ºtzenjahr. Members have to be 40 years old and are elected by the existing members.Alfred Lutz, in: Klaus Thommel (ed.): 100 Jahre Ravensburger Altentrommler. 1906-2006. Eine historische Dokumentation. Ravensburg 2006, http://www.altentrommler.de *Neue Spohngruppe, a drumming group founded in 1965 *Mehls√§cke, a pipe band founded in 1990 The following fanfare bands play not only at Rutenfest, but take part in Rutenfest events including the Antrommeln custom: *Fanfarenzug Tell, founded in 1958 *Fanfarenzug Rauenspurg *Fanfarenzug St. Florian = Parade = On \\"Ruten Monday\\" morning, a big parade called Historischer Rutenfestzug with roughly 6,000 participants winds its way through the old town of Ravensburg. 4,500 pupils and adults parade in historical costumes presenting the town's history from medieval times, when Ravensburg was an international trading centre, to the 19th century. The three-hour-long parade also includes 120 horse-drawn carriages, all Rutenfest drumming groups, and many wind and brass bands from Upper Swabia with c. 1,200 musicians in total. In 2012, c. 50,000 spectators lined the streets along the parade.Sommer, Sonne, Rutenfest ‚Äì 50 000 Zuschauern geht das Herz auf, in: Schw√§bische Zeitung, July 24th, 2012 = Shooting competitions = Adlerschiessen eagle The festival features several annual shooting competitions where local pupils compete for the title Sch√ºtzenk√∂nig (champion marksman). All these open-air competitions are held in the Kuppelnau area. * The oldest Rutenfest shooting competition is the Adlerschiessen (de), a crossbow Popinjay shooting on a wooden Imperial Eagle (from the old German coat of arms), with the Imperial Orb in the eagle's left claw as highest trophy. Other trophies are the sceptre, the crown and the eagle's head and heart. All feathers can also be shot and entitle to prizes. The first Adlerschiessen took place in 1823. As of 2012, 816 male pupils of local grammar schools took part in the competition. In 2003, a similar competition for female pupils was launched (with 618 participants in 2012). Both competitions are held simultaneously on \\"Ruten Tuesday\\" afternoon. Der Reichsapfel f√§llt mit dem ersten Schuss, in: Schw√§bische Zeitung, July 25th, 2012 Especially the members of the Landsknechte and those of the Trommlerkorps (who organize the event) rival each other in the hunt for the title of Sch√ºtzenk√∂nig. * In the 1960s, Bogenschiessen, a bow and arrow shooting for Realschule pupils (male and female) was introduced. The wooden target depicts the towers and gates of the old town of Ravensburg, with the Mehlsack tower as the highest trophy. The shooting is held on \\"Ruten Monday\\" afternoon. * In 2001, the Wappenschiessen crossbow shooting was introduced for Hauptschule pupils (male and female). The target depicts the town's coat of arms, with the cross from the coat of arms as the highest trophy. The shooting is held on \\"Ruten Saturday\\" afternoon. Every five years, thousands of local grammar school alumni from all over the world gather to the Altenschiessen (roughly translated as \\"shooting by seniors\\") on \\"Ruten Sunday\\". Targets and rules are the same as those of the Adlerschiessen. Participants shoot in reverse age order, with the oldest participant starting the event (in 2015 this was Guido Erb, born in 1920). The champion is called Altsch√ºtzenk√∂nig. The first Altenschiessen was held in 1900. In 2015, the competition had over 2,300 participants. Realschule alumni organize a similar alumni shooting with bows and arrows (Bogenschiessen aller ehemaligen Realsch√ºlerInnen) that has taken place every five years since 1996.Freundeskreis aller ehemaligen Realsch√ºlerInnen = Other events = On \\"Ruten Friday\\" afternoon in a ceremony in the Schw√∂rsaal hall, the \\"Trommlerkorps\\" is presented with school flags and other insignia by the mayor of Ravensburg. After that, the festival is officially opened by the mayor on the central Marienplatz square, followed by a performance of all pupils' drumming groups. On \\"Ruten Saturday\\" night, Ravensburg's central square, the Marienplatz, is populated by some 20,000 people at the Fr√∂hlicher Auftakt (roughly translated as \\"blightful beginning\\"). This event has continually grown since its first instalment in the 1960s. Wine (and increasingly beer) is served. On \\"Ruten Sunday\\" morning, an ecumenical open-air church service is held by the local Catholic and Protestant parishes on Marienplatz. Public fireworks on \\"Ruten Tuesday\\" night mark the end of the five days of Rutenfest. In the aftermath, two further events take place: *Trommlerball (\\"drummers' ball\\") on the following Thursday night is a dance ball and society event organized by the Trommlerkorps der Gymnasien, roughly comparable to a d√©butante ball. All Trommlerkorps members take part in social dances with their Trommlerbraut (\\"drummer's bride\\"). Initially held at the Konzerthaus until ca. the 1960s, the ball was held in the congress centre in the neighbouring town of Weingarten until 2017.Trommler tanzen bis zum Morgen, in: Schw√§bische Zeitung, 26 July 2008 Since 2018, the ball takes place in the Oberschwabenhalle multi-purpose hall in Ravensburg. The Trommlerball attracts c. 1,000 guests; the hall is usually sold out early in advance.http://www.troko.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=6&Itemid;=12 *Rutenvergraben (birch burying) is celebrated on Saturday night at the Veitsburg, the castle that towers above the town. The name of this event is purely symbolical (hence nothing is actually buried). Citizens meet once again in a large beer garden, and the Rutenfest drumming groups play for the last time.

In 1953 he was killed, test flying a prototype Gloster Javelin. Lawrence's total flying experience amounted to more than 3,000 hours on over 80 different types. Early life and Fleet Air Arm career Peter Godfrey Lawrence was born in late 1920 in Leeds. He entered the aircraft industry as a Handley Page apprentice in 1937 and in 1939 joined the Fleet Air Arm in on a seven-year short-service commission. He flew Fairey Swordfish from 1940 to 1942, operating from HMS Eagle, HMS Illustrious and HMS Argus, and also from bases in the Western Desert. In 1942 he was posted to the Naval Service Trials Unit, and from 1942 to 1944 he made 450 deck landings by day and night on 25 different aircraft carriers. In 1944 he was appointed to the Firebrand Tactical Trials Unit to develop the use of single-seat torpedo bombers, which had just been brought into service. He was awarded an MBE in recognition of this work in the 1946 new year honours. Test Pilot In 1945 he was demobilised and joined Blackburn Aircraft as an experimental test pilot. After taking the (No. 4) Empire Test Pilots School course, he was appointed Blackburn's chief test pilot in 1948. He was promoted to Commander in the Royal Naval Reserve in January 1951. Lawrence's passion for flying was not confined to work hours. From 1948 he was a participant in major UK air-races, flying aircraft such as Firebrands, a Blackburn B.2, and a Percival Proctor. He won the Kemsley Trophy and was third in the King's Cup in the summer of 1952. In June 1952 he left Blackburns and joined English Electric Aviation as a test pilot on the Canberra programme. However six months later, at the beginning of 1953 he transferred to Glosters, with the aim of replacing Bill Waterton as chief test pilot. On 11 June 1953, Lawrence was flying the second Javelin prototype (WD808), which had recently been fitted with a modified wing. He had been flying for half an hour when he radioed to his home base, Moreton Valence, that he was in trouble. At he had entered an unrecoverable flight condition (deep stall). Rather than abandon the prototype, he elected to crash-land with the intention of minimising damage to the aircraft and avoiding homes and people on the ground. He descended in a glide, but realised he was over playing-fields where teams of boys were playing cricket. He stayed with the aircraft all the way down to , put it into straight slow run in, and ejected. Unfortunately, he was too low and he was killed on impact with the ground.

V. S. N. Prasad under Sri Venkateswara Cine Chitra. The film features Ram Pothineni and Kriti Kharbanda in the lead roles. The soundtrack was composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, Mani Sharma also scored one song for the film and given the background score. The film was released on 1 February 2013 to negative reviews from critics and commercial failure at the box office. The film was later dubbed into Hindi as Mahaveer No. 1 in 2014. Plot The film opens with Narayana (Prabhu) and his son escaping from a gangster Durga (Abhimanyu Singh), who intends to kill them. The film then shifts to 2001 where a young boy named White, an orphan, enters the Ongole market. He manages to catch the attention of many people including the market chairman Adikeshavulu (Prakash Raj), who is god to the people of the market, with his tactical ways of business and establishes him as a businessman there. Years later, White (Ram Pothineni), still a leading merchant in the market is the owner of 4 shops. On the inaugrational event of his fourth shop, he meets Sandhya a.k.a. Sandy (Kriti Kharbanda), Adikeshavulu's daughter and falls for her. The MLA (Ahuti Prasad) wants to buy the market so he can shift it to a land on the outskirts of the city. During this, it is also revealed that Adikeshavulu is not a good man but is pretending to be a good one. Whenever he returns home after difficultly pretending to be a good person, he stands in front of the mirror and removes his clothes. Out of anger for Adikeshavulu not giving him the market, the MLA makes White the market chairman. Adikeshavulu beats the MLA and makes him announce Adikeshavulu the chairman. White agrees on the condition that Sandy must marry him. Out of greed for the market, Adikeshavulu agrees and gets White and Sandy engaged. On the night after their engagement, White goes to Sandy's house to meet her. But she escapes from him and reaches outside the house with her grandmother (Rama Prabha) and mother and complains on White. Just then, Adikeshavulu comes in drunk but controlled but White understands and goes away but his fatherlike business partner in a drunk mode reveals that White has a father who lives in Tripura. Adikeshavulu uses this information and sends Durga to find White's father. But at Tripura, Durga bumps into White while trying to kill an old enemy. It is now revealed that the 'old enemy' (Narayana) is White's father and White's real name is Dorababu. White's partner finds out and blames White of being the son of the person who murdered his family. It is now that White reveals his past. Years back, Narayana used to be the chairman of the Ongole market. Adikeshavulu was the son of another man (Jaya Prakash Reddy), who envied Narayana and wanted his post. The man commits suicide as he could not get the post and taking pity, Narayana appoints Adikeshavulu his man and the market continues to prosper with Adikeshavulu pretending to be good. One day, Adikeshavulu starts collecting money from the sellers as the funds for building shelter and giving food for the sellers were insufficient. Narayana comes there, stops Adikeshavulu and tells him that he will give the money. Another man in the market who envies Narayana blames him of acting in front of the people and accuses him of telling Adikeshavulu to collect the money. But nobody believes him and continue to trust Adikeshavulu. Adikeshavulu kills the man along with Durga and it is revealed that it is he who killed his brother. White (Dorababu), decides now to take revenge. Adikeshavulu kidnaps Narayana and puts him in a sack in the market and burn the market to ashes as he will get the insurance as profit. The market is burnt that night but White comes to save it and chases Adikeshavulu into the announcement office. There, Adikeshavulu reveals everything about himself, including the fact that he was the one who killed his brother, which White accidentally catches on the announcement mike. Everybody outside hears everything and charges at Adikeshavulu, who ends up being killed by their beatings. The people welcome Narayana back in the market, and he gets his post as market president back.

He ruled from 1600 to 1634 and is considered to be the greatest of the Thanjavur Nayak kings. His reign is noted for the attainments of Thanjavur in literature, art and Carnatic music.  Early life  Raghunatha Nayak was the eldest son of Achuthappa Nayak and was born after intense penance by his father. The Raghunathabhyudayam and Sahityanatyakara give a detailed account of his childhood. As a boy, Raghunatha was taught the shastras, the art of warfare and administration. He had multiple queens, chiefly Kalavati, who is referred to in the Raghunathabhyudayam as Pattampurani. Ramabhadramba, who wrote a history of the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty, was one of his concubines. In his early days Raghunatha won acclaim fighting the Golconda Sultanate. Raghunatha ascended the throne in 1600 and ruled with his father from 1600 to 1614 and as sole monarch from 1614 to 1634.  Campaigns and wars  In 1614, Sriranga II, the Raja of Vijayanagar, was killed by a rival claimant, Jaggaraya. Raghunatha proceeded against Jaggaraya to avenge the murder. Different accounts give varying versions of the events. According to Ramabhadramba, Raghunatha first fought a rebellious regional chieftain called Solaga, pursuing him to Kumbakonam and then besieging him in his island-fortress on the Kollidam before turning his attention to the Portuguese and attacking Jaffna. After his victory over the Portuguese, Ramabhadramba claims, Raghunatha returned to the Indian mainland, where he pursued Jaggaraya to Toppur and defeated him. He later constructed a pillar of victory and took possession of Bhuvanagiri near Chidambaram. According to Yagnanarayana Dikshita, the campaign was preceded by a council held by Achuthappa Nayak in which Raghunatha, Govinda Dikshita and the exiled king of Jaffna participated. The whole campaign against Jaggaraya and the Solaga was the outcome of this conference. The Battle of Toppur was dated to 12 December 1616 based on the Raghunathabyudayam, which states that Raghunatha was camping at Pazhamaneri in August 1616. Portuguese chroniclers dated Raghunatha's victories in Jaffna to the beginning of 1616. The campaign against the Solaga must have also taken place at this time. = Campaign against the Solaga = The Raghunathabyudayam says that Solaga was the ruler of an island (Antaripagataha) and a feudatory of Krishnappa Nayak of Gingee. He is described as a highwayman who attacked passers-by and stole their belongings. Raghunatha's campaign was a punitive expedition to put an end to his activities. Raghunatha attacked Solaga's headquarters near Kumbakonam. Supported by Krishnappa Nayak, the Portuguese and Muslim mercenaries, Solaga put up stiff resistance but was finally defeated by Raghunatha's artillery. He was captured and imprisoned along with his family. = Invasion of Jaffna = Following the victory over Solaga, Raghunatha attacked Jaffna, possibly to punish the Portuguese, who had aided Solaga in the war against him. While according to Nayak chronicles, Raghunatha himself led the expedition, according to Portuguese records, the campaign was led by one Khem Nayak, a general in service of Raghunatha. The Thanjavur Nayak forces were victorious and the Portuguese were evicted from Jaffna. Cankili II of the Aryachakravarti Dynasty was placed on the throne. However, Cankili II ruled for barely two years before being overthrown and killed in 1619. = Battle of Toppur = On his return to India, Raghunatha Nayak personally led an army against Jaggaraya, who had usurped the throne of Vijayanagar after killing Sriranga II. Jaggaraya was assisted by the Nayak of Madurai. Yagnanarayana Dikshita mentions that Jaggaraya was supported by Yavanas and Parasikas, whose identities remain unclear. Raghunatha's army consisted of strong infantry and cavalry divisions, elephant corps and gunmen. The Vijayanagar claimant Rama Deva Raya fought alongside him. The two armies met at Toppur. Raghunatha was completely victorious; Jaggaraya was captured and killed and Rama Deva Raya was placed on the throne. = Later campaigns = Raghunatha also conducted minor campaigns. Though he was not able to prevent the Aryachakravarti dynasty from being overthrown, he kept up pressure against the Portuguese by supporting rebellions. The Karaiyars‚Äîa class of fishermen along the Gulf of Mannar‚Äîmade six attempts between 1620 and 1621 to overthrow Portuguese rule. Raghunatha, himself, sent five armies between 1619 and 1621 to conquer Jaffna, but all of them ended in failure.  Patronage of arts and music  Raghunatha patronized Carnatic music in his kingdom. The Nayak himself composed a number of Yakshaganas and was a good veena player. Kshetrayya, the composer from Muvva, visited Thanjavur and composed padas during his reign. Raghunatha also renovated a number of Vaishnavite temples. He constructed the Ramaswamy Temple in Kumbakonam, the popular Saraswathi Mahal Library in Thanjavur and the gopura of the Adi Kumbeswarar Temple in Kumbakonam. He expanded the Uppiliappan Temple and the Rajagopalaswamy Temple, Mannargudi. The car festivals of Thiruvaiyaru and Pasupatikoil were conducted on a lavish scale. During the time of Raghunatha the structure of the veena also evolved and he invented the raga Jayantasena and the tala Ramananda. He also composed a number of kavyas in Telugu, important ones being Parijatapaharanamu, Valmikicharitram,Rukminiparinaya Yakshaganam and Ramayanam. He wrote the Sanskrit plays Sangita Sudha and Bharatha Sudha. The Telugu poets Ramabhadramba, Madhuravani, Chemakura Venkataraju and Krishnadhwari were active during his reign. Raghunatha was also an expert sword-fighter and horse rider. Raghunatha's biographies note his generosity towards Brahmins. Raghunatha constructed a number of agraharas and gave costly gifts to poor Brahmins and the disabled. A 1604 inscription from Narattampoondi records Raghunatha's gift of the village of Kailasapuram for the upkeep of the Srirangam temple. He also gave lavish gifts to the Madhva pontiff, Vijayendra Tirtha, and the Sri Mutt in Kumbakonam.  Relationship with European powers  Raghunatha maintained cordial relations with the Danes and the English. The Portuguese had established factories at San Thome and Nagapattinam on the eastern coast prior to the accession of Raghunatha, while the Dutch founded a settlement at Tegnapatnam in 1610. South Indian rulers patronized and supported the Dutch in order to neutralize the belligerent Portuguese. Ove Gjedde of the Danish East India Company founded the settlement of Tranquebar on 19 November 1620. Following a visit to Raghunatha's court, the English captain John Johnson and Brockedon, the President of the English settlements, tried to convince the directors of the East India Company to send a mission to Thanjavur. Johnson wrote home: Johnson's proposal was approved; a mission landed at Karaikal on 23 May 1624 and proceeded inland to Thanjavur to seek an audience with the king, reaching the capital in June. Raghunatha received the visitors warmly and granted them permits to trade freely in Karaikal. However, Raghunatha later withdrew his concessions and demanded an annual rent of 7,000 riyals. This volte-face has been attributed to pressure from the Portuguese and the Danes. Nevertheless, Johnson rejected the Nayak's offer and returned to England, where his action was severely censured. The English also tried to get Pondicherry from the Gingee Nayaks and failed.  Extent of Raghunatha's kingdom  Raghunatha's empire extended far beyond the confines of Thanjavur district. His inscriptions have been found in Thirukkoshtiyur in Ramanathapuram district, Lalgudi in Tiruchirappalli district, Govindavadi in Kanchipuram district, and Nedugunram and Narattampoondi in Vellore district.

In 2009 when militants again challenged the writ of government, and provincial governments failed, the army was again called in. The army launched Operation Rahe-e-Rast in 2009 to curtail militancy in the region and apprehended a number of militants. Before the operation, the militants used to collected money from the people of valley. Those who couldn't give money had to surrender their children, some of whom were used as suicide bombers after brainwashing them.  Objective  Sabawoon was set up for the recuperation of militants (mostly juvenile) apprehended during Operation Rah-e-Rast so they can be helpful to the society in a fruitful manner. The objective of the institute is to de- radicalize youngsters who were indoctrinated by the militants. Militants after indoctrinating them used them for suicide bombing and fighting against the government institutions. Students are provided all basic necessities of life and a healthy environment. Muhammad Farooq Khan a religious scholar observed that most of the young militants and suicide bombers captured during the military operation were teenagers and belonged to poor families.  Academics  As of 2010, 34% children inducted into the institute are turned in by their parents, 39% are apprehended by the security force while 25% surrendered themselves. Local residents also have the opportunity to point out children they believe are militants and should be arrested. The children are divided in three group: High-risk, Medium-risk and Low-risk based on the degree of indoctrination they received while among militants. Students are to remain inside the campus during the training, while their parents are allowed to meet them, once in two weeks. Studies are divided in modules, that include regular education up to secondary level, technical education and de-radicalization education. The participants are also taught about ethics, patriotism and Islam's true meaning.

It houses an image of the Infant Jesus which originally came from Acapulco, Mexico and was handed over by a wealthy merchant to the Archbishop of Manila at that time, who later turned it over to the parish priest of Tondo, Manila. Since 1572, the image of Santo Ni√±o has been enshrined in this church. Tondo Church is one of the most visited churches in the Philippines.  Church history  Tondo Church is one of the earliest churches established by the Spanish friars in Luzon and was recognized as a Provincial Chapter on May 3, 1572 and Fray. Alonzo Alvarado, OSA was the first minister who directed the church. In 1572, Tondo Church has its visitas in northern suburbs of Tondo, namely Calumpit and Malolos thru Fray Diego Ordo√±ez de Vivar (Conquistas delas Islas). In 1575, Bulakan town together with Lubao, Betis Macabebe was added and in 1599 Tambobong (now Malabon). Tondo also extends its ecclesiastical territory to Morong. It is believed that the construction of the first stone monastery started in 1611 under the term of Fr. Alonso Guerrero, then minister of Tondo. The convent of Tondo was relieved from its ten percent contribution to Manila in 1620 because of the needed costly repair of the convent and the church. This resolution was repeated the following year because of the needed assistance to be provided for the father provincial who was then staying in Tondo. During 1625, Fr. Antonio de Ocampo pawned the convent for 800 pesos, the sum to be spent during a three-year term improvement of the house facilities like the cenador, the staircase, etc. It is believed that the construction of the church and convent was finalized at around this time. In 1641, the prior was authorized to repair the church due to the turmoil caused by the Sangleys and in addition, water cisterns were installed to save budget for purchasing. Four years after, the church was in need of immediate repair because it was devastated again by an earthquake. The repairs and restoration were done and the \\"church looked magnificent and strong in its full masonry construction.\\" This magnificence was short-lived because in 1661, Governor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara who feared Koseng (Koxinga), a Chinese pirate from Hermosa Island (Formosa, Taiwan) might fortify himself inside the structure. He commanded that the structure be pulled down. According to a clause of the Chapter of 1661, \\"the convent suffered so much during the war of the Sangleys that now it cannot be sufficient by itself.\\" The income of Sangley stores, the alms for the souls in purgatory, some donations and tax exemption were utilized for the rebuilding of the church and the convent. In 1714, the Private Definitory proposed that the church and convent of Tondo pay back from their own properties the funds that were spent for the reconstructions of the church. In 1728, the convent used 2,000 pesos from the provincial funds to renovate and enlarge the church. The facade and the two towers that were about to fall were reconstructed in 1734. This rebuilding was done during the term of Fr. Diego Berga√±o. The building was damaged again by the earthquake of 1740 and was repaired the next year. The church was heavily damaged again by another earthquake in 1863 and was rebuilt for the third time by Fr. Manuel Diez Gonzalez. The restoration was completed by Fr. Casimiro Herrero, parish priest of Tondo from 1874 to 1880, who followed the plans of Architect Luciano Oliver in 1873. For the first time in the country, steel framing was used for the media naranja dome and iron sheets for the roofing. Condrado Gregorio took over the construction from Architect Oliver and used aramadura de hierro, which came from England. Fr. Mariano Gil led the construction of the cemetery during his priorship from 1889 to 1898. The fence was designed by Architect Gregorio N. Santos. Walls made of stone were imported from Guadalupe and Meycauayan. The entire construction project costed 2,150 pesos. The organ was imported from the renowned Amezua Organeros of Barcelona, Spain and was installed in 1893. It had one main keyboard with 56 keys and a peladier with 19 keys and four combinations. In 1898, Fr. Pablo Alvarez bought a molave door for 1470 pesos to be used as the main entrance door. Church services came to a halt when it was used as a cuartel during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. The services were held in the house of Primo Arambulo at Santiago de Vera Street. During the last days of the Japanese occupation, the church was reopened for thousands of refugees. In 1997, aside from major repairs, Carillon bells were installed under the term of Msgr. Emmanuel Sunga as Parish Priest.  Architectural style  The structural envelope is characterized by minimal ornamentation with Ionic rectangular pilasters attached at the main facade. Massive buttresses also support the unproportional domes of the bell towers. There are also blind arched openings that contrast with the rectangular voids and a triangular pediment. The neoclassical architectural style has its big influence the construction of the church and convent. In its interiors, It is composed of a main central nave that is flanked by two aisles that are linked by solid columns. The internal space spans 65 meters in length, 22 meters in width and 17 meters in height. Feast Day of Sto. Ni√±o de Tondo The feast day of Sto. Ni√±o in Tondo is celebrated in the third Sunday of January. The fiesta in Tondo has the biggest participation in Manila, not only because Tondo is the most populous district in the city and poorest but perhaps because of the many anecdotes connected with the Sto. Ni√±o of Tondo. According to Philippine Historical Commission, the peoples of Tondo celebrated the feast day with a fluvial procession that ‚Äúattracted thousands of visitors.‚Äù Tondo's terrain at that time consisted of waterways and tributaries which were connected to Manila Bay, a probable reason why the present stone church of Tondo was constructed on elevated ground (several meters above sea level) to prevent sea waters from inundating the Church. Nick Joaquin, in his book entitled Almanac for Manile√±os (Published in 1979) describes the previous celebrations of the fiesta: Gallery File:Tondo Church 21.JPGNorthern Facade File:Tondo Church 19.JPGPortico File:Tondo Church 23.JPGMain Portal File:Tondo Church 02.JPGHistorical Marker File:Tondo Church 01.JPGOne of the Bell Towers File:Tondo Church 05.JPGMonument of Pope Leo XIII References Roman Catholic churches in Manila Buildings and structures in Tondo, Manila Cultural Properties of the Philippines in Metro Manila ","title":"Tondo Church"},{"id":"36508096","text":"Felix Dausend (born 1 November 1988) is a German footballer who plays as a striker for R√∂chling V√∂lklingen.

Hertzog and the South African Party under Jan Smuts merged to form the United Party, which won 111 of the 150 seats in the South African general election, 1938 with Hertzog as prime minister. Dissident National Party members formed the Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party under D.F. Malan. When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany in 1939, Hertzog proposed to his party and parliament that South Africa remain neutral. This was defeated and Hertzog left the government to be replaced by Smuts with South Africa joining the Allies. Following the rupture of the United Party, Hertzog and his supporters negotiated with the Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party in an attempt to reunify the Afrikaner parties. Initially, the differences between the more moderate Hertzog group and Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party seemed insurmountable and so the Volksparty was formed with Ben Schoeman elected as the chairman of the party on 9 December 1939.Schoeman, Ben.

But further disagreements led to another split in 1941 with Hertzog and Nicolaas Havenga forming the Afrikaner Party and Malan the Herenigde Nasionale Party (Re-united National Party).

It was active from 1962 to 1991, and in 1992 it was re-established as Mizlou Television Network, Inc., which is now based in Tampa, Florida. Mizlou later branched out into cable sports channels. Operation The network was not a full-time network, but produced sports and entertainment television shows offered to a set of affiliates set up event by event. It was seen on affiliates of NBC, ABC, and CBS, and on independent television stations and cable channels. Mizlou utilized the AT&T; system to distribute signals to television stations nationwide via land lines and microwave facilities. Mizlou produced the first \\"live\\" coast-to-coast satellite feed, of a New York Cosmos soccer game, from San Jose, California to WOR-TV in New York in the late 1970s. History =Unisphere Broadcasting System= In mid-1965, radio businessman Vincent C. Piano proposed the Unisphere Broadcasting System. The service would have operated 2.5 hours each night. However, Piano had difficulty signing affiliates; a year later, no launch date had been set, and the network still lacked a \\"respectable number of affiliates in major markets.\\" =Mizlou TV Network= Mizlou began syndicating college football bowls in 1968. Maryland sold Mizlou rights to two of its Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball games along with the women's basketball Maryland versus Immaculata game on January 26, 1975. This was the first national broadcast of a women‚Äôs college basketball game with 100+ stations signing on to the telecast. Mizlou broadcast the first three Fiesta Bowl starting in 1971 and lost money on the first broadcast. In 1979, the Network broadcast the Miss Black Universe USA and International beauty pageants. The network carried the 1975 Blue-Gray Football Classic, angering the all-star game's committee by convincing the game clock operator to cut three minutes off the clock in the first quarter. Mizlou was hired by U.S. Tobacco to broadcast the College National Final Rodeo in 1981. In 1985, Mizlou decided not to renew the Holiday Bowl broadcast contract. In 1986, the network signed a three-year deal with the Freedom Bowl adding them to their bowl line up of Bluebonnet, Cherry, Independence and Hall of Fame Bowls for that year. In August 1989, Mizlou Communications announced the November launch of Sports News Network, a 24-hour sports news and interview basic channel. Mizlou in February 1990 made a private placement of securities to keep SNN going. Mizlou made another attempt before July 1990 and attempted a third placement of $15‚Äì$20 million in July 1990 for the network. SNN went dark on December 17, 1990 as parent Mizlou Communications filed for bankruptcy. Mizlou was in talks with Landmark Communications and Telecable Corporation as a potential buyer of the channel and other assets. In January 1991, Landmark dropped plans for a sport news channel and its discussions with Mizlou for the purchases of Sports News Network due to Tele-Communications Inc.'s planned launch of Prime Sports News, an all-sports news cable channel.

Hinksey was an English football club located in Oxford. The club last played in the Hellenic Football League Division One East, and folded in 2014. History AFC Hinksey started life as a pub team when The Shelley Arms F.C. were formed in the 2006‚Äì07 season, by Gavin Preston. The team was entered into the RT Harris Football League, made up of teams from within the City of Oxford. The first season saw The Shelley Arms complete an historic treble which included the Doug Hobbs Cup, the RT Harris Senior Cup and the RT Harris First Division, gaining promotion to the Premier Division of The RT Harris Football League. The second season saw another treble in the bag with the RTH Premier Cup, retaining RTH Senior Cup and winning the RT Harris Premier Division, and in the process gaining promotion to the Oxfordshire Senior League. Oxfordshire Senior League guidelines stated that 'pub teams' were not to compete in their competition and so AFC Hinksey were born, moving to the Hinksey area of Oxford to play at Brasenose College. Starting in Division 2 of the Senior League, Hinksey again achieved promotion at the first attempt, The following season (2009/10) saw Hinksey win the Oxfordshire Senior League First Division claiming yet another promotion. By now, Hinksey had gained promotion in every season they had been in existence and in their first season in the top division of the Senior League, Hinksey bagged a double, winning the Premier Division and the Oxfordshire Senior League President's Cup. The next season saw Hinksey again finish top of the Premier Division table only to be deducted 9 points. The club finished as runners up but were still eligible for promotion to the Hellenic Football League. The rise up the football pyramid stalled slightly as Hinksey found their feet in the Hellenic League Division One East but finished in mid table.

Bus Projects is dedicated to supporting the critical, conceptual and interdisciplinary practices of Australian artists. In addition to its core gallery-based program of exhibitions, events and residencies, Bus Projects collaborates with a range of artists and arts organisations to produce projects off-site and within the public realm. Bus Projects has been operating for over 10 years, during which time it has presented new work from more than 700 artists, hosted live performances and professional development workshops for artists, and produced a series of CDs called Outer, featuring the work of national and international sound artists.  History  Founded as Bus by Tim O'Donoghue and Kade McDonald in August 2001, it was originally located at 117 Little Lonsdale St. Bus began as a design collective whose members held a shared interest in art \\"...it was just a collective of people that decided that a gallery, as something that joined onto everybody else's practices, was a good idea.\\"Mooney, C & O'Donoghue, T BUS, Heagney, D ed. Making Space VIA-N 2007, p. 78, The first exhibition held at Bus the work of the advisory board to the gallery, featuring the artists Nick Mangan, Jo Scicluna, Renee So as well as Selina Ou, Luke Adams, Chad Chatterton, Julian Oliver and Mark Harwood. The gallery had three exhibition spaces known as the Skinny Gallery, Main Gallery and the Sound Gallery. It also had a project space that hosted artist residencies and performances. In 2007, the artist, Claire Mooney replaced Tim O'Donoghue as the gallery director and in February 2008, Bus incorporated and became officially known as Bus Gallery Inc. In November 2008, the artist Tim Webster became the gallery director and in December 2008, Bus Gallery Inc. formally changed its name to Bus Projects Inc. in order to reflect the group's focus on spatial arts practice. In 2009, a new exhibition space dedicated to video projections was opened in the renovated stairwell of the building. Throughout 2009, Bus Projects was also home to the bookshop, Sunshine and Grease, operated by Patrick O'Brien. In January 2010, Bus Projects was notified of the building owner's intention to use the gallery as temporary offices until a full redevelopment of the site. In March 2010, Bus Projects moved out of the building at 117 Little Lonsdale Street. Throughout 2010, Bus Projects presented a series of off-site events, including The Sound Playground and Play With Your Food in conjunction with other arts groups until relocating to Donkey Wheel House in early 2011. In 2013 the organisation relocated to new gallery premises in Collingwood, located on the ground floor of 25 ‚Äì 31 Rokeby Street, Collingwood, a former paint factory that has been transformed & redesigned by John Wardle Architects. In 2020, Bus Projects moved into Collingwood Yards, a new, permanent and affordable home for scores of artists and independent arts organisations working across music, visual arts, performance, digital media, creative industries and beyond. Situated across the former Collingwood Technical School campus, Collingwood Yards spans over 6500sqm. The site consists of three buildings and a leafy central courtyard and is located in one of Australia‚Äôs most diverse, rapidly transforming and dense inner city neighbourhoods.

The Histoire ancienne jusqu'√† C√©sar (\\"Ancient history until Caesar\\") is the first medieval French prose compilation of stories of antiquity, mostly consisting of the so-called Matter of Troy and of Rome, besides text from the Bible and other histories. Composed in the early 13th century in northern France, it told the history of the world from the creation to the time of Julius Caesar. Often copied, it underwent an important redaction in Italy in the 14th century; its influence extended into the Renaissance. In manuscripts from the 14th and 15th centuries it was frequently found together with the Faits des Romains, which continued the history of the Roman Empire. History Jean Fouquet, \\"Caesar Crossing the Rubicon\\", 15th-century MS of Histoire Ancienne jusqu'√° C√©sar and Faits des Romains in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. The text was written for Roger IV, the ch√¢telain of Lille; the earlier suggestion that Wauchier de Denain was its author is no longer held. There is some debate about the dating of the text; the range of possible dates is 1208 to 1230. The Histoire ancienne is usually illuminated; the cycles of illustrations are described by Oltrogge, Die Illustrationszyklen zur 'Histoire ancienne jusqu'√† C√©sar. The author had included moralizing passages in verse, left out in subsequent versions in which they were \\"progressively suppress[ed]\\". The so-called second redaction came into being in Naples c. 1340, in which the version of the legend of Troy based on Daretis Phrygii de excidio Trojae historia was replaced by a prose adaptation of the Roman de Troie by Beno√Æt de Sainte-Maure. The Faits des Romains may have been \\"composed with the intent of seeing a contemporary Caesar in the person of the French king\\", Philip II of France. The function of such anachronistic accounts of the past, according to scholars such as √âtienne Gilson, was to create an \\"eternal present\\" in which the classical past and the medieval present were joined. One of the consequences of elevating \\"past and present ... into a kind of atemporal equivalence\\" is that historical accuracy or even faithfulness of translation is not an objective; texts are freely translated and adapted to allow a \\"wholesale recreation of the past in the image of the medieval world\\". The removal of the prologue, the moralizing passages, and of appeals to the audience (all of which help establish an authorial presence and an individual voice) in later revisions has been argued to make the Histoire Ancienne a more general version of classical history, whose applicability exceeds that of the context of Roger de Lille. A general account of antiquity in the vernacular also served (according to historians such as Jacques Le Goff) to allow the nobility (generally untrained in Latin) to read of a glorious past in which it could inscribe itself without clerical intervention. One notable author who used it extensively, particularly for its account of the Trojan War, was Christine de Pizan.

His father, with the same name and also a sculptor, was born in Mallorca and was a resident of Zaragoza. The first record of the artist is a contract dated 18 March 1515 for entry as an apprentice with the sculptor Dami√°n Forment, to learn the trade of \\"ymaginer√≠a\\". According to historian Jos√© Mar√≠a Azcarate, by 1518 he was carving images for his master in wood and alabaster, being paid based on the size of the work. Although his main production of sculptures was done in the Aragon region, he undertook several jobs in the cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, where he spread the influence of Forment. Between 1521 and 1523 he worked at the altar of the Chapel of St. Michael at the Cathedral of San Pedro de Jaca, where Juan de Moreto directed the execution while the sculpture was done by Gil Morlanes el Joven, Gabriel Yoly and Juan de Salas. Salas executed the base of the altar and the sculptures of the epistles. In collaboration with the sculptor Yoly he was involved, although to a lesser extent, in carrying out the work of the high altar of Tauste in San Pedro and one of San Cosme and San Damian in Teruel.

It operated from 1856 to 1957, remaining open as a ventilation shaft for Mardy Colliery until 1989. Development =Bwllfa No.1= In 1853, Sam and Joseph Thomas began sinking a pit shaft within the remote farming community at the top of the Dare Valley. The two shafts were deep, and initially operated by water balance winding, with ventilation from a furnace. Production commenced in 1856, but by 1857 business partner Ebenezer Lewis was the sole owner. =Nantmelyn Colliery= In 1856, Mordecai Jones began sinking the shaft of the Nantmelyn Colliery (). After opening in 1860, by 1864 the Bwllfa Colliery Company were the owners. In 1867 they sunk a second deep shaft, ventilated by Guibal fan. Brogden and Sons took over the colliery in 1873. Operations In 1876, the two pits were merged under the combined Bwlfa and Merthyr Dare Coal Company. After a series of accidents criticised by the HM Inspectorate of Mines, seeking new investment the company reformed as the Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries (1891) Ltd., allowing opening of the Gorllwyn level in 1891. By 1896, No.1 pit employed 1,128, while renamed Nantmelyn now Bwllfa No.2 employed an additional 231. In 1907, the company took over the mineral rights to the old Powell's pit (also known as Pwll Troedrhiwllech and Cwmdare Pit), opened By Thomas Powell 1851, which it reopened as Bwllfa No.3. Like many mines, the company lost some of its workforce during World War I, but by the end of 1918 this had recovered to: 1,054 at No.1; 931 at No.2/new drift No.4; 423 at No.3. Due to its ease of access, in 1922 the first electric powered coal cutting machines to be used in the South Wales coalfield were installed at Bwllfa No.3. By 1923, producing both ironstone and steam coal: *No.1: employed 1,166 men producing from the Gorllwyn, Two Feet Nine, Four, Six and Nine Feet, Four Feet Upper and Lower, Yard and Seven Feet seams *No.2: employed 388 producing from the Yard, Gellideg and the New seams. A further 147 men were employed on the surface, shared with No.4 *No.3: employed 690 producing from Seven Feet, Lower Yard, Gellideg and the New seams *No.4: employed 202 producing on the New drift, and 139 producing on the Gorllwyn level Taken over by the Bwllfa and Cwmaman Coal Co. in 1928, part of Welsh Associated Collieries, in 1935 WAC merged its mining investments with those of Powell Duffryn. The new company decided to cease production from No.3, which became a ventilation shaft. Post World War II, by the time of nationalisation under the National Coal Board, Powell Duffryn had also ceased production at No.1, equipping it as a ventilation shaft and pumping station. Coal was now only raised from No.2 and No.4, with a total below and above ground workforce of 572. Housing and amenities The influx of miners to what had been up to this point an isolated farming community necessitated the construction of housing to support them. Between 1853 and 1859, the first streets were laid down on the west side of the Dare Valley, which would become the centre of the village of Cwmdare. At the same time, a small collection of houses were constructed on the east side of the valley, near the Merthyr Dare Colliery, which became known as Pithead. As the collieries grew over the next century, Cwmdare grew with it, with rows of terraced miners' cottages being built to the north-west of the original hamlet to create homes for the expanding workforce. Merthyr Dare closed in 1884, and Cwmdare Colliery in 1936. Transport Two separate railway lines operated in the area operated by rival companies. The Dare and Aman Branch of the Vale of Neath Railway reached Bwllfa Colliery in 1857. This railway reached Cwmdare from Gelli Tarw near Llwydcoed, crossing the Gamlyn Viaduct at Penywaun and Dare Viaduct, both designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.Cwmdare In 1866, an extension by the Taff Vale Railway followed a route near the River Dare from a junction close to Aberdare. Closure With coal being mined from under the Maerdy mountain from both sides, it was only a matter of time before the economics of production dictated the closure of one of the two mines. In 1949 the NCB had made a ¬£7-million investment in Mardy Colliery, creating capacity for No.3 and No.4 shafts to access 100 million tons of coal in the 5 ft seam, estimated sufficient to last for one hundred years. It had been transformed into one of the most modern pits in the United Kingdom, with fully electric winding, new extended railway sidings and a coal washing plant on the surface. In 1957, further investment in Mardy created new underground roads linking the mine directly to Bwllfa. At this point the decision was made to stop raising coal from Bwllfa which would be kept open only for ventilation and water extraction. By 1977, workings at Mardy had moved further north and east, and the decision was made to close the last shaft at Bwllfa. Northern view of Dare Valley Country Park, showing the former pit winding gear of Nantmelyn Colliery Present-day usage In 1970, a country park was proposed for the area. After planning and two years of land reclamation work, involving the clearing of coal tips and re-routing of the River Dare, Dare Valley Country Park was opened in December 1973. It includes many historical remnants of the coal mining past, including coal trams and the pit winding gear from Nantmelyn Colliery which forms part of the monument. Legal principle Sometimes courts and tribunals need to speculate on what might have happened when making a determination of damages or compensation due in response to the loss of some facility. In a 1903 decision in the case of Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries (1891) Ltd v. Pontypridd Waterworks Co.,[1903] AC 426 the House of Lords formulated a principle known as the Bwllfa principle, which states that where the court has knowledge of what actually happened, it need not speculate as to what might have happened, but should base its decision on the known facts.Reynold F., Palmer A.

Besides the standard edition there is also a \\"deluxe campaign edition\\" containing a bonus DVD with a feature-length documentary called Making Sounds. A 5.1 channel surround version of the album was released as part of the A Sunday Night Above the Rain Blu-ray set released on Racket Records in 2014.  Political activism  The 17-minute opening track, \\"Gaza\\", is perhaps the most overtly political song Marillion have done since 1989. Its lyrics take the perspective of a boy growing up in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. Singer Steve Hogarth explained, \\"This is a song for the people ‚Äì especially the children ‚Äì of Gaza. It was written after many conversations with ordinary Palestinians living in the refugee camps of Gaza and the West Bank. I spoke also to Israelis, to NGO workers, to a diplomat unofficially working in Jerusalem, and took their perspectives into account whilst writing the lyric. It is not my/our intention to smear the Jewish faith or people ‚Äì we know many Jews are deeply critical of the current situation ‚Äì and nothing here is intended to show sympathy for acts of violence, whatever the motivation, but simply to ponder upon where desperation inevitably leads. Many Gazan children are now the grandchildren of Palestinians BORN in the refugee camps - so called \\"temporary\\" shelters. Temporary for over 50 years now. Gaza is today, effectively, a city imprisoned without trial.\\" Like David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Chris Martin and others, Marillion support the \\"HOPING Foundation\\",http://www.hopingfoundation.org/ an NGO that supports Palestinian children and adolescents in the refugee camps, and encourage their fans to do the same.  Promotional activities  Like with several previous albums, Marillion used pre-ordering for Sounds That Can't Be Made to finance the album. In return, pre-order buyers received the special edition deluxe campaign edition box-set. The band had previously used the same approach successfully with the albums Anoraknophobia (2001), Marbles (2004) and Happiness Is the Road (2008). Before the release of Sounds That Can't Be Made, two promotional songs were released on YouTube: \\"Power\\" on 17 July 2012NEW SONG POWER and \\"Gaza\\" on 4 September 2012.POSTING SOUNDS  Cover  The cover was designed by Simon Ward.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is notable for its associations with the poet, William Wordsworth and his family, and for its annual ceremony of rushbearing. History The first church in Grasmere was founded by Oswald of Northumbria, King of Northumbria, in 642. The present church stands on or near the same site, and is dedicated to him. It dates from the 14th century, and was doubled in size by the addition of a parallel nave to the north of the original nave between 1490 and 1500. The roof was rebuilt in about 1562, which involved adding a second tier of arches to the arcade. The windows and doors were restored in 1840 by George Webster. Architecture St Oswald's is constructed in roughcast stone with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a double nave, with a south porch and a southeast tower. The tower is battered (its walls incline inwards as the tower rises), it has lancet windows, and plain corner pinnacles. Interior showing the two tiers of arches and the remarkable roof beams Inside the church, the arcade has five arches rising from ground level, and four arches above. The arcade does not reach the ridge of the roof, but ends in the upper tie beams of the open timber roof. In the church is a poor box dated 1648, and a balustered altar rail of 1725. The pulpit is in Arts and Craft style, and carved with fruits and flowers. The font is medieval, and consists of an octagonal bowl on a stepped base. The stained glass includes a window on the north side of the church from about 1926 by Shrigley and Hunt, and two windows on the south side from the 1890s by Henry Holiday. There is medieval glass in windows on the south side of the chancel. Monuments William Wordsworth lived in Grasmere from 1799, and was buried in the churchyard of St Oswald's. Inside the church, the monuments include one to Wordsworth by Thomas Woolner, with an epitaph by John Keble. There is also a wall tablet in the chancel in Doric style to the antiquary Daniel Fleming who died in 1701. The church has a sculpture of the Madonna and child by Ophelia Gordon Bell, who lived and worked in Grasmere. Organ In the 1870s the church acquired an organ by Wilkinson of Kendal. The instrument was moved to Lancaster after the present organ by Binns of Leeds, was installed in 1923 as a memorial to nurse Nellie Taylor. It is proposed to renovate the organ for its centenary. Churchyard =Wordsworth graves= Wordsworth graves In the southeast corner of the churchyard is a group of twelve graves surrounded by railings.

Their live shows were notorious for sparking civil disobedience (including the occasional riot) and causing serious damage to venues at which they performed. The group was also infamous for their \\"The Party's Over\\" graffito of an upside-down martini glass, and was heavily involved in the Tompkins Square Park Riot in August 1988. While the band disbanded in the early 1990s, a small anarchist social movement continued to exist under the same name for several years thereafter. History Party's over logo The earliest incarnation of the group, which was founded in Hamburg in 1984 by Peter Missing, included Sascha Konietzko and En Esch of industrial act KMFDM, who were only with Missing Foundation briefly before going their own way. After Missing moved back to New York City in 1985, he started a new version of the group, and the line-up became more stable, with a core group of Missing, Florian Langmaack, Chris Egan, and Mark Ashwill. The band's second album, 1933, was released in 1988, when the band's social unrest fomenting activities began to increase dramatically. The group's upside-down martini logo had been spray painted all over the East Village that year. At a show in mid-1988 in New York, the group doused oil barrels in kerosene and set them on fire, then rolled them into the audience, causing major damage to C.B.G.B.'s, the club where they were performing. In a July 31 protest, one of the band members was arrested. A week later, Missing helped organize another initially peaceful protest at Tompkins Square Park, which grew violent after the band performed a concert. The group's biggest cultural impact, other than their disruptive live performances, was the creation of their infamous \\"The Party's Over\\" image of an upside-down martini glass, which became a symbol for political and social dissent. The logo was part of a major graffiti campaign in New York's Lower East Side during the band's existence. An accompanying phrase, 1933-1988, was added as a way to draw comparisons between contemporary New York and the Weimar Republic. The group was accused of Satanism by a WCBS-TV news during the height of their influence. After releasing a total of five albums, the group disbanded in 1992, and Missing initially moved to Berlin, then relocated to Copenhagen. In 2013, Dais Records reissued the first two Missing Foundation albums, Missing Foundation and 1933 Your House Is Mine in a limited edition vinyl format. Musical style Missing Foundation patterned itself after early industrial acts such as Throbbing Gristle and Einsturzende Neubauten. The group used a variety of found metal objects to create its percussion, and only rarely used traditional instruments such as guitars. Lead vocalist Missing often shouted through a bullhorn, on many occasions because the club owners had turned off the in house speaker system. Missing and his cohorts were once described as \\"a scattered collection of anarchists and antigentrification militants\\".

In a career which lasted from January 1990 until January 1995 she ran forty-four times and won fourteen races. Although she won two races on the flat, Flakey Dove was a specialist hurdler who competed mainly in National Hunt races. She ran in some races restricted to mares in the early part of her racing career, but was mainly campaigned against geldings and entire horses in open competition. In 1994, her best year, she became the third mare to win the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham Racecourse. Her other important wins included the Cleeve Hurdle and the Champion Hurdle Trial. The Racing Post rated her one of the ten best jumping mares of the 20th century. Unlike the majority of modern racehorses, Flakey Dove was not a Thoroughbred. Background Flakey Dove was a bay mare with a small white star, bred and owned by the Price family of Herefordshire. Shortly after the Second World War, Tom Price paid ¬£25 for a broken down point-to-point mare of uncertain parentage named Cottage Lass. She became a successful broodmare, becoming the ancestor of three generations of racehorses, all of whom included the word \\"Dove\\" in their names. As Cottage Lass's pedigree could not be traced to any of the Foundation mares recorded in the General Stud Book, her descendant could not be registered as Thoroughbreds. Tom Price's grandson, Richard, who ran a 400 acre livestock farm near Leominster, trained Cottage Lass's great-granddaughter Flakey Dove throughout her racing career. Flakey Dove was sired by the Oats, a successful National Hunt stallion whose other progeny included the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Master Oats. Racing career =1990-1992: early career= Flakey Dove began her racing career in early 1990 by contesting three National Hunt flat races (also known as \\"bumpers\\"). She won on her debut at Ludlow Racecourse in February, running on gamely to win by a head and then finished second at Haydock Park and Hereford. In the 1990/1991 season, Flakey Dove was campaigned in Novice hurdle races. She fell in her first hurdle race in February and was well beaten in her next two races before winning a Novice handicap race at Newbury Racecourse in March under a light weight (for jump racing) of 142 pounds. She was beaten when favourite in her next race at Exeter Racecourse and ended the season with a rating of 102, suggesting that she was well below top class. As in her first two seasons, Flakey Dove did not run until February of the 1991/1992 season, but she then ran eight times in less than three months. Racing in handicaps, she won four times and finished second twice as her official rating rose to 140. On her last appearance of the National Hunt season, she started favourite for the Grade III Swinton Handicap Hurdle at Haydock Park in May and finished third to Bitofabanter. Later in the month she made her first appearance in a flat race and finished unplaced in a Listed race at Newbury. =1992/1993 season: hurdle racing= Flakey Dove's next season began in February when she finished second in a race at Stratford and then ran fifth in the Tote Gold Trophy at Newbury. In the same month she recorded her first success at Graded level when beating Lift and Load by five lengths in the Grade II Regency Hurdle at Warwick, but the form was reversed ten days later when Lift and Load beat the mare in the Grade II Berkshire Hurdle at Newbury. In March, Flakey Dove appeared for the first time at the Cheltenham Festival. She started a 50/1 outsider for the Champion Hurdle and finished seventh of the eighteen runners behind Granville Again. She then finished second in a handicap hurdle at Ascot and fourth in a flat race at Nottingham. On 1 May, Flakey Dove recorded her best win up to that time when she defeated the former Champion Hurdler Beech Road in the Staffordshire Hurdle at Uttoxeter Racecourse. Two days later she finished unplaced in the Swinton Hurdle before ending the season by finishing eighth in a flat race at Bath. =1993/1994 season: hurdle racing= Flakey Dove ran thirteen times in her championship season: according to Price the mare thrived on a busy racing schedule. She began by recording her first win in a flat race when she won a maiden event at Nottingham. She was beaten in her next four races over hurdles but never finished worse than fourth. In January 1994, Flakey Dove entered contention for the Champion Hurdle with a win in the Champion Hurdle Trial at Haydock Park. Ridden for the first time by Richard Dunwoody, she took the lead two hurdles from the finish and drew clear to win by twenty lengths from the Irish-trained favourite Tiananmen Square. Dunwoody was in the saddle again a week later when Flakey Dove ran in the Grade I Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham. She confirmed her improvement by overtaking Sweet Duke at the last hurdle and winning by six lengths. She then started favourite for the Tote Gold Trophy but finished third behind Large Action and Oh So Risky. In this race she carried 154 pounds and was ridden by Norman Williamson. Dunwoody reclaimed the ride in the Berkshire Hurdle on 5 March and the mare won the Grade II event very easily by twenty lengths. On 15 March, Flakey Dove, ridden by Mark Dwyer, contested the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. The mare started the 9/1 third favourite behind Oh So Risky (9/4) and Large Action (8/1). The field of fifteen runners also included the previous champions Granville Again and Morley Street. Dwyer restrained the mare in the early stages before moving up to join the leaders four hurdles from the finish. Approaching the final hurdle, Flakey Dove overtook the leader, Large Action, and ran on in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths from Oh So Risky. She became the first mare to win the race since Dawn Run in 1984 and the first British- trained mare to win since African Sister in 1939. The mare's win was enthusiastically received by the Cheltenham crowd and Richard Price admitted that \\"I had a tear in my eye\\" as he led Flakey Dove into the winner's enclosure. On her next appearance, Flakey Dove won a flat race at Haydock on 2 April before running in the Grade I Aintree Hurdle a week later. She was made favourite for the race but ran poorly and finished tailed off behind Danoli. On her final run of the season, Flakey Dove returned to the flat and finished unplaced in the Group Three Sagaro Stakes at Ascot. =1994/1995 season: hurdle racing= Flakey Dove failed to win in her final season although she ran some good races in defeat. She finished third to Oh So Risky in the Ascot Hurdle in November and in the following month she ran second to Large Action in the Bula Hurdle, pleasing her connections with a \\"determined\\" effort. At Kempton Park in late December she started favourite for the Christmas Hurdle and finished a close fifth to Absalom's Lady. The mare's last two runs came in January 1995. She was runner-up to Relkeel in the Champion Hurdle Trial and fifth to Mudahim in the Cleeve Hurdle. Retirement Flakey Dove retired to become a broodmare. She produced at least three minor winners: Minella Lodge, Just Smudge and Dovecote Lodge. Another of her foals, the unraced mare Bay Dove, was sired by Alderbrook and was therefore the offspring of two Champion Hurdle winners. She was retired from breeding in 2010 and was euthanised in February 2016 at the age of 30. Richard Price said \\"She took us all to the big places and always ran with credit wherever we took her... She couldn't go on any longer and was put to sleep. It's sad but we're left with great memories.\\" Pedigree References 1986 racehorse births 2016 racehorse deaths Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Champion Hurdle winners Cheltenham Festival winners National Hunt racehorses Non-Thoroughbred racehorses ","title":"Flakey Dove"},{"id":"36508644","text":"Musarna is an Etruscan settlement located approximately 10 km west of Viterbo, Italy.

On February 18, 2019, the Vatican Information Service announced that the Pope Francis has appointed Borys Gudziak as Archeparch of Philadelphia for Ukrainians and Metropolitan for the Ukrainian Catholic Church in USA and thus concurring with the recommendation of the appointment offered by the Synod of Ukrainian Catholic Bishops, which met in September 2018 in Lviv, Ukraine. He was installed on June 4, 2019.http://catholicphilly.com/2019/02/news/local-news/paris-based- ukrainian-catholic-bishop-to-head-u-s-archeparchy/ Early life and education Gudziak was born in Syracuse, New York US. His parents, both Ukrainian Greek Catholics, had come to New York from western Ukraine in the early 1950s . After completing his pre-university studies at Christian Brothers Academy, he graduated from Syracuse University, obtaining a dual degree in philosophy and biology in 1980. He entered the College of Saint Sophia in Rome where, as a student of the Lviv Archeparchy under Cardinal Josyf Slipyj, he attended the Pontifical Urban University. In 1983 he graduated in theology and began doctoral studies in an interdepartmental program of Slavic and Byzantine Cultural History at Harvard University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1992. His thesis, Crisis and Reform: The Kievan Metropolitanate, the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and the Genesis of the Union of Brest, was published by the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute in 1998. From October 1994 until July 1995 he attended the Pontifical Oriental Institute, examining in particular the synthesis of neopatristic Orthodox theologian Georges Florovsky. Priest In 1992, he moved permanently to Lviv, where he founded the Institute of Church History (ISC), becoming its director until October 2002. In 1993 he was appointed chairman of the Commission for the Renewal of the Lviv Theological Academy by Archbishop Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky. From 1995 until 2000 he served as vice rector of the Lviv Theological Academy, then as rector from 2000 to 2002. In that year, Gudziak became rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University (founded on the basis of the academy), and later its president. He was ordained on 26 November 1998 in the Cathedral of St. George in Lviv by Bishop Sofron (Mudry) and incardinated in the Major Archeparchy of Lviv of the Ukrainians. He is the author of over 50 studies on the history of the Church, theological training and on different topics of cultural relevance. Bishop On 21 July 2012 it was announced that Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation of Michel Hrynchyshyn from the pastoral Apostolic Exarchate for Ukrainians of the Byzantine rite in France, and appointed Borys Gudziak apostolic exarch for the Ukrainian faithful of the Byzantine rite in France, at the same time appointing him Titular Bishop of Carcabia. He was ordained a bishop on 26 August 2012 and installed in a Divine Liturgy on 2 December 2012. On January 19, 2013, Benedict XVI elevated the Apostolic Exarchate of France, Benelux and Switzerland for the Ukrainians to the status of a full apostolic eparchy (the equivalent of a diocese), and named it after Saint Vladimir. Gudziak, though already an ordained bishop, is now an eparch (the ordinary, or head, of a fully established Eastern diocese), instead of exarch. He ceased to be a titular bishop since he is now a full eparch. Gudziak is the 49th member of the Synod of Bishops of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Besides France, the eparchy also includes Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, and Switzerland. In May 2018, Gudziak received an honorary doctorate of humane letters degree during the 164th commencement of Syracuse University.

It is named after C√∂lln, one of the two cities which came together to form Berlin; the park location was originally just outside it. Approximately in area, the park came into existence in the 18th and 19th centuries on the site of fortifications. It was redesigned as a public park in 1869-73 and was further modified in the 20th century with the addition of first a bear enclosure, the B√§renzwinger, and later a permanent exhibition of sculpture, the Lapidary. The park is a registered Berlin landmark.K√∂llnischer Park, Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt , retrieved 30 July 2012. The park contains five buildings, the first of them being the M√§rkisches Museum, a complex of buildings. The complex was built between 1907 and 1907, and was designed by Ludwig Hoffmann. The second was the B√§renzwinger, next to the south entrance to the park. This was built between 1938 and 1939 on the site of a former sanitation depot, and was designed by Ludwig Hoffmann. The B√§renzwinger has contained up to five bears at once, however no longer contains any following the death of Schnute, Berlin's last official city bear in 2015. At the east end of the park there is the Landesversicherungsanstalt building, a large office building designed by Alfred Messel, to be the headquarters of the Landesversicherungsanstalt, an insurance company. The fourth building is the AOK building, a six-storey steel-framed office building built from purplish brick, on the south side of the park, opposite the B√§renzwinger. The final building is the Volksbadeanstalt, on the western side of the park. It was built in 1888 as a public bath. Location and name The park lies between Wallstra√üe on the north side, the Stra√üe am K√∂llnischen Park on the east side, Rungestra√üe on the south side and Inselstra√üe on the west side.K√∂llnischer Park, Ausgew√§hlte Gr√ºnanlagen in Mitte, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt , retrieved 30 July 2012. Its boundaries are not clearly delimited; on the west side there are some buildings between the park and the street, including the former building of the K√∂llnisches Gymnasium, built in 1865-68 and now used as a music school, and on the north side, facing the river, is the M√§rkisches Museum. The western edge is dominated by a large office building built in 1903/04 as the headquarters of the Landsversicherungsanstalt, which has been used for the past few years by the Department of Urban Development of the Senate of Berlin, and the southern by the 1931/32 building of the German health insurance group Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse, which under the German Democratic Republic was the Parteihochschule Karl Marx. The park is accessible via the M√§rkisches Museum U-Bahn station on line U2 and bus number 147.Street plan at Berlin.de. It is also close to the promenade which has been created along the bank of the Spree south of the Jannowitzbr√ºcke. History alt=View of K√∂llnischer Park in Berlin-Mitte with the M√§rkisches Museum in the background The site of K√∂llnischer Park was just outside C√∂lln in the Middle Ages. Until the mid-17th century, it was undeveloped low-lying, swampy land prone to flooding by the Spree.Karl Seidel, \\"Zur Geschichte des K√∂llnischen Parks\\", Berlinische Monatsschrift 7.2, 2001, pp. 146-60, p. 146 Following the decision by Frederick William, the 'Great Elector' to encircle Berlin with fortifications, this became the location of Bastion VII, which was known at the time as \\"the bulwerk in the morass'. The work required the creation of large embankments and lasted until 1683; the swampland around the bastion was not fully drained until 1687. After such lengthy construction, the works were already out of date militarily, and after 1700 served only to control the comings and goings of visitors and residents, prevent desertion, and enable the collection of tolls on those entering the city.Seidel, p. 148. By 1700, Mulberry trees had been planted on the walls, but only 'persons of rank' were permitted to promenade along them. After Berlin had grown considerably and the Customs Wall had been built around it, King Frederick William I (1688-1740) ordered the defensive walls to be demolished. Civilian buildings had already grown up on the bastions; a windmill and a house for the miller were built on Bastion VII, and these caused the eastern portion to be left standing longer than other parts of the fortifications. Some of the rubble from the demolished fortifications was used to build up Wilhelmstra√üe; the rest was thrown into the defensive ditch outside the walls. In 1736, Frederick William I gave the site of the park and the M√§rkisches Museum to one of his generals, Friedrich Sebastian Winnibald Truchse√ü, Count of Waldburg, who built a house there and laid out an extensive garden.Seidel, p. 150. After his death in the Battle of Hohenfriedberg, David Splitgerber, a merchant and banker, bought the land and was also given the remaining eastern bastion section; from 1750 onwards, he operated Berlin's first sugar processing plant on the site, and also enlarged and improved the garden. In 1779, the baroque garden was mentioned by the bookseller and author Friedrich Nicolai: \\"It has very charming areas, in particular it includes an open pavilion on a rise, which is small, but has tall trees growing upon it\\".\\"Er hat sehr reizende Partien, dazu geh√∂rt besonders ein offenes Lusthaus, auf einer kleinen, aber mit hohen B√§umen bewachsenen Anh√∂he\\", quoted in Seidel, p. 150. The sugar plant was forced to close in 1788. The buildings on the site were then used in succession as tobacco storage, a hospital, a workhouse, and a men's lunatic asylum.Seidel, p. 151. The M√§rkisches Museum was later built there.Seidel, p. 155. Splitgerber's heirs sold the garden and in 1799 it was acquired by a Freemason lodge, the Gro√üe National-Mutterloge zu den drei Weltkugeln (Grand National Mother Lodge of the Three Globes). The Freemasons built a lodge building which opened in December 1800, and developed the remainder into a landscape garden, one of the most attractive gardens in Berlin. In 1858/59 Inselstra√üe was extended through the garden to connect K√∂penicker Stra√üe to the city centre, and the Lodge was forced to sell the larger, eastern portion of the site to the city. The K√∂llnisches Gymnasium was then built there.Seidel, p. 152. How to use the remainder of the site was discussed for years; a desire to preserve the trees led to the rejection of several commercial proposals. On 15 April 1869, the Assembly of City Deputies (Stadtverordnetenversammlung) decided to establish a public playground (probably one of the first in the city) and 'promenade location' there on plans drawn up by the first city director of gardens, Gustav Meyer, dedicated the necessary funds, and urged rapid execution of the plan.Seidel, pp. 152-53. The plan involved some new plantings, fencing, and benches. This renovation was completed in 1873. The park reached its current dimensions in 1883 after the ditch was filled in.Seidel, p. 153. Ludwig Hoffmann, the architect of the M√§rkisches Museum (completed in 1907), then made some changes including creating views across the park to the new museum. The last major modification of the park took place in 1969-71 to designs by Eberhard Jaenisch, Stefan Rauner and Roswitha Schulz: a mound which remained on the site of the bastion was levelled, a children's playground was added, a terrace was built behind the museum, and the Lapidary was created. Attractions =Lapidary= The Lapidary is an open-air museum of primarily stone artworks, both originals and copies, which formerly decorated buildings that no longer exist. Some are set into the walls around a 1969 terrace, while others are freestanding at various locations in the park.Lapidarium, Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt , retrieved 22 July 2012. For example, in the walls of the terrace there are fragments of five carved heads from the keystones over windows, supposed to be from the Old City Hall of Berlin in Spandauer Stra√üe and attributed to Georg Gottfried Weiyhenmeyer; two allegorical reliefs; 17th- and 18th-century building signs; a late Gothic vault keystone; and a 16th-century sandstone relief from the Stadtschlo√ü.Seidel, p. 154. Hercules Fighting the Nemeian Lion, by Gottfried Schadow The freestanding sculptures include amongst others: * a larger-than-life sandstone sculpture of Hercules fighting the Nemean Lion, at the eastern entrance to the park, was modelled in 1787 by Gottfried Schadow and executed in 1791 by Conrad Nicolas Boy. The work originally decorated a bridge over the K√∂nigsgraben, was moved in 1891 to the Herkulesbr√ºcke (Hercules Bridge) over the Landwehr Canal, was placed in storage in 1934 and was installed in the park in 1971. * two groups of putti, also in sandstone, from the balustrade of the New Palace in Potsdam. * a mid-19th-century terracotta fountain in Italian Renaissance style from the garden of a villa in the Hirschgarten section of Friedrichshagen * an oversize sandstone vase with bulls' head handles created after a classical model by an artist in the school of Friedrich Christian Glume (1714-1752) for the attic course of the colonnades at Sanssouci. Wusterhausener B√§r, a small round tower with tiled walls =Zille Memorial and Neo-Renaissance Fountain= Modern and thus atypical of the sculptures in the park is the bronze statue of the artist Heinrich Zille, which was created in 1964-65 by Heinrich Drake for an exhibition in the Treptower Park and afterwards moved to K√∂llnischer Park. It is listed as a landmark by the City of Berlin.Standbild Heinrich Zille, Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt , retrieved 22 July 2012. At the Rungestra√üe corner of the park there is a historic fountain from a private garden in Hirschgarten. Moved to the park in 1971, it was made in about 1860 and is known as the Neo-Renaissance Fountain.Neorenaissance-Brunnen, √ñffentliche Brunnen in Berlin: Mitte, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt , retrieved 22 July 2012. It is currently enclosed for repairs. =Wusterhausener B√§r= The Wusterhausener B√§r (or Wusterhausischer B√§r) is a small round tower, with tiled walls and a helmet-shaped sandstone cupola topped with a carved trophy display of weaponry, which was formerly part of a weir regulating the water level in the ditch that formed part of the wall defences. B√§r in this case derives from the Latin berum, meaning \\"weir\\", and it was apparently named for Wusterhausen because the road to that town passed by its original location at Bastion VII.Seidel, p. 158. It was moved to the park in 1893 and is now incorporated into the Lapidary. It is listed as a Berlin landmark.Wusterhausener B√§r, Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt , retrieved 22 July 2012. Buildings =M√§rkisches Museum= The M√§rkisches Museum was built between 1901 and 1907. It was designed by Ludwig Hoffmann as a complex of buildings representing architecture of the Mark Brandenburg and North Germany in general in the Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance periods.M√§rkisches Museum, Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt , retrieved 30 July 2012. One of the Berlin bears in the B√§renzwinger =B√§renzwinger= Next to the south entrance to the park is the B√§renzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 1938-39 on the site of a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears,Bernd D.W. Unger, Der Berliner B√§r: Ein Streifzug durch Geschichte und Gegenwart, M√ºnster: Waxmann, 2000, , p. 67 and a public lavatory,Seidel, p. 159; according to Unger and the city parks site, the bear house is the former sanitation depot. and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city.Andrea Schulte-Peevers and Jeremy Gray, Germany, Footscray, Victoria: Lonely Planet, 2007, , p. 109.Joanna Egert-Romanowskiej and M√°lgorzata Omilanowska, Germany, DK eyewitness travel guides, London: Dorling Kindersley, , p. 80. The impetus for building the B√§renzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day after the end of the celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II.Seidel, pp. 158-59. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms.Seidel, p. 159.Berlin's Bear-Pit, Berliner B√§ren, 1999, archived February 2011, retrieved 30 July 2012. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo.Unger, p. 78.Marcus Hochstadt, \\"K√∂llnischer Park ‚Äî You Knew The Bears Had To Be Somewhere\\", BerlinDude.com 2012, retrieved 22 July 2012.

Built in 1923 to house a bank, the building became the city hall in 1939, and it has remained Astoria's seat of government for more than 75 years. History The three-story building was constructed in 1923, as the Astoria Savings Bank,\\"Astoria Bid Low on Two City Jobs: Remodeling of Buildings to Cost $39,309\\" (December 18, 1938). The Sunday Oregonian, p. 18. to replace that bank's previous building on the same site, destroyed by fire. The bank went out of business in 1929, as a result of the stock-market crash of that year. Clatsop County acquired the building in 1936,\\"Plans Shaping Up Rapidly for Big Salt Lake City‚ÄìAstoria Air Derby: Public to Share in Prize Awards\\" (July 19, 1936). The Sunday Oregonian, p. 8. and in 1938 the city of Astoria used a Public Works Administration grant to fund the conversion of the building into a new city hall,\\"PWA Projects Finished at Astoria\\" (June 8, 1939). The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon), p. 21. to replace the Old Astoria City Hall, built in 1904‚Äì05. The city offices, as well as those of the Astoria School District, moved into the new city hall at the end of March 1939.\\"School Offices To Be Moved\\" (March 27, 1939). The Oregonian, p. 4. The move put Astoria's city hall in downtown, an improvement in public access over the \\"isolated\\" previous location at the edge of downtown. A major modification made in the 1970s was the addition of a second floor, through extension of a mezzanine level. That addition was a new \\"middle floor\\", between the original two floors. The city council chambers are located on that second floor, and what then became the third floor is occupied by most of the city staff's offices. In 1998, the building was designated a contributing property in the Astoria Downtown Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 22 of that year. 2011 remodeling The building's north end, above what is now the public entrance, in late 2011, during the temporary closure for remodeling A $1.2 million remodeling of the building began in late summer 2011 and was completed in April 2012. During the work, the city offices were temporarily moved to space at the Astoria Yacht Club. Along with restoration of the building's entrance and open lobby, the work included the addition of fire sprinklers and other safety and lighting improvements. Installation of a new, ADA-compliant elevator was also included in the project, replacing a small, non-compliant elevator. The council chambers were changed from an L-shape, which had made it difficult for people in part of the room to see and hear the activities, to a square shape, expanding the room's capacity from around 60 people to around 80. The chambers were also reoriented to face the Columbia River (north). Windows along that portion of the building's east side, formerly used for a staff lounge, were made part of the council room. The old bank vaults are still in place, their locks disabled, and the 2011 remodeling included refitting one of them as an office and copy room. Certain period features were restored. These included the return, from the Flavel House Museum, of a vintage chandelier in the lobby. It had adorned that space during the building's years as a bank and remained until 1949, but had hung in the music room of the Flavel museum since then. See also *Albert W.
