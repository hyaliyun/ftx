Seitz, from a screenplay by James Ashmore Creelman. It stars Louis Wolheim, Robert Armstrong, and Jean Arthur. The plot concerns railroading on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road), and the movie was largely filmed along that railroad's lines in Montana. The railway yard in Miles City, Montana was a primary setting, while rural scenes were shot along the railway line through Sixteen Mile Canyon, Montana. Additional footage was shot in Chicago, Illinois (where the Milwaukee Road was headquartered until 1986 when it went out of business.) The film was the first ever shot in the new Spoor-Berggren Natural Vision Process. Plot Screenshot from the film. Louis Wolheim plays the boss of the railroad yard in Miles City, Montana. The film opens with a landslide across the tracks in Montana, and a repair crew is dispatched to clear the tracks. Several hobos are lounging nearby and are put to work helping the repair crew. One of the hobos, played by Robert Armstrong, is discovered to have been a former railroad engineer who lost his job due to insubordination. He is given a new job for the railroad by the yard boss, but quickly falls in love with the boss's fianc√©e, played by Jean Arthur. Jealousy grows between the two over the affections of Arthur with both of them attempting to win her in marriage. Things come to a head during a fight in the railroad yard between the two, during which Wolheim is hit by a train and injured. To save his life, Armstrong must transport him in record time to Chicago for surgery.

Burt as Chief Dispatcher * James Farley as Joe Geraghty (Cast list as per AFI database) Notes Danger Lights was filmed during a period when some movie studios were experimenting with various widescreen film formats. As part of this trend, two versions of the film were created. One used standard 35mm film and Academy ratio, the other used an experimental 65mm widescreen format at a 2:1 aspect ratio. This latter process was called \\"Natural Vision\\" and was invented by film pioneers George Kirke Spoor and P. John Berggren. The Natural Vision print of the film was reportedly screened at only two theaters (the only two with the equipment necessary to show the film), the State Lake Theater in Chicago and the Mayfair Theater in New York, and no copies of it are known to exist today. Danger Lights would be the only film created using this process, and the entire effort to move to wide screen would be shelved for several decades due to the increased costs of both production and presentation. =Historically significant footage= Danger Lights features rare footage of a tug of war between two steam locomotives, actual documentary footage of the activities in the Miles City yard, and what is believed to be the only motion picture footage of a dynamometer car from the steam railroad era in the USA. Similar footage may have existed in MGM's Thunder (1929), with Lon Chaney but that film now only exist in fragments making it partly a lost film.Thunder (1929) - LouChaney.org In 1958, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.

As archbishop, he had a difficult relationship with King Offa of Mercia, who at one point confiscated lands from the archbishopric. By 787, some of the bishoprics under Canterbury's supervision were transferred to the control of the newly created Archbishopric of Lichfield, although it is not clear if J√¶nberht ever recognised its legitimacy. Besides the issue with Lichfield, J√¶nberht also presided over church councils in England. He died in 792 and was considered a saint after his death. Early life J√¶nberht was a monk at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury before being selected as abbot of that monastic house.Costambeys \\"J√¶nberht\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He came from a prominent family in the kingdom of Kent, and a kinsman of his, Eadhun, was the reeve of King Egbert II of Kent. J√¶nberht himself was on good terms with Egbert.Yorke Kings and Kingdoms p. 43 Archbishop of Canterbury J√¶nberht was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on 2 February 765,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 214 at the court of King Offa of Mercia; this location implies that his election was acceptable to the king. In 766, he received a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority given by the papacy. At this time, Kent had been subjected by Offa; in 776, perhaps at the urging of J√¶nberht, Kent rebelled and secured its freedom.Keynes \\"J√¶nberht\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England In 780 and 781, J√¶nberht attended church councils at Brentford that were led by King Offa. Although initially on good terms with Offa, J√¶nberht's ties to Egbert were also strong: after the Battle of Otford, Egbert granted a number of estates to Christ Church. When Offa reasserted control over Kent, which occurred by 785 at the latest, he confiscated these lands and regranted to some of his thegns.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 113‚Äì120 Elevation of Lichfield During J√¶nberht's term of office, a dispute arose between the see of Canterbury and Offa which led in 787 to the creation of the rival Archdiocese of Lichfield under Hygberht. Originally, Offa attempted to bring the southern archbishopric of Canterbury to London, but when the papacy refused permission, Offa secured the creation of a third archbishopric in the British Isles. Lichfield was the main Mercian bishopric, and thus the new archbishopric was under Offa's control.Yorke Conversion of Britain p. 151 There were several reasons for the conflict between J√¶nberht and Offa. J√¶nberht's opposed Offa's deposition of the Kentish dynasty. They conflicted over land which they both claimed as theirs, and J√¶nberht refused to crown Offa's son Ecgfrith.Yorke Kings and Kingdoms pp. 116‚Äì117 Problems were also caused by the archbishop minting his own coins at Canterbury.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 106 Matthew Paris, writing in the thirteenth century, stated that J√¶nberht conspired to admit Charlemagne to Canterbury if he invaded Britain. This story may reflect a genuine tradition recorded at St Albans Abbey, where Paris was based, or it may be a fabrication to fill in details of J√¶nberht's life where Paris had no other information. A rumour during J√¶nberht's reign also falsely claimed that Offa was plotting with Charlemagne to depose Pope Hadrian I; at least one modern historian, Simon Keynes, believes it possible J√¶nberht was behind the rumour. Offa's eventual successor later admitted to the papacy that Offa's actions had been motivated by hatred of J√¶nberht and the Kentish people.Witney \\"Period of Mercian Rule in Kent\\" Arch√¶ologia Cantiana p. 89 In 787, Pope Hadrian sent a pallium to Hygberht of Lichfield, elevating Lichfield to an archbishopric, and Ecgfrith was crowned. There is no extant contemporary evidence, however, that J√¶nberht ever recognised Hygberht as an archbishop. Canterbury retained as suffragans the bishops of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 144 Later life J√¶nberht presided at a council held at London, sometime after the elevation of Lichfield, attended by most of the bishops from southern Britain.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 143 J√¶nberht died on 12 August 792. J√¶nberht was buried in the abbey church of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. J√¶nberht has since been revered as a saint, with a feast day of 12 August.

She was known as a warrior princess and was said to be able to enter battle on horseback with a sword with an army of female horseriders. It was said that she and her adopted daughter, Puteri Saadong had mystical powers. A pair of muntjacs ‚Äî being the queen's favourite pet ‚Äî is depicted in Kelantan's state emblem to represent her prominence in the state's rich history. Kelantan state emblem Background According to certain historical records, Cik Siti Wan Kembang was born in 1585. Her parents were Raja Ahmad and Cik Banun, both of royal lineage. Raja Ahmad was crowned Ruler of Kelantan in 1584. However, Raja Ahmad died in 1589, when the princess was only 4 years old. Therefore, Raja Hussein of Johor was made Regent of Kelantan. Cik Siti Wan Kembang ascended to the throne of Kelantan in 1610 AD upon the death of Raja Hussein. She was said to have resided in Gunung Chinta Wangsa, Ulu Kelantan, located approximately 40 km from Kuala Krai. Cik Siti never married, and therefore never had children of her own. She adopted Puteri Saadong as her daughter. Puteri Saadong was the princess of the ruler of Jembal, whom Cik Siti had close ties with. Kijang Coins Differing views are given regarding the origin of the Kijang gold coins. Kijang means \\"muntjac\\" in the Malay language and derives its name from the engravings of said animal on the coin. The Kijang coins are generally associated with Cik Siti. Myth of the Kijang Coins According to Kelantanese folklore, the kijang is her favorite pet and has always fond of it since young while some stories suggest that there are once an Arab trader come to her country and seeking permission to trade presented a muntjac to the Queen as a gift. She became very fond of the muntjac and taking it as her pet to the point she ordered its image to be inscribed on the gold coins of her country. Another version was linked to the influence of Saivite Hinduism. The connection was based on the fact that the earliest issue of Kijang coins resembled the Indian humped-back bull and the bull motif was depicted on ancient Hindu coins which were circulated in the northern Malay states. Myth of the Kijang Coins Jelasin Fort Jelasin fort (Malay: Kota Jelasin) is situated in the southern suburbs of Kota Bharu, the state capital of Kelantan. The site is approximately 4 to 8 kilometres from the town centre, in the ward of Wakaf Che Yeh. It was built in 1563 for Cik Siti Wan Kembang, her adopted daughter Puteri Saadong and Puteri Saadong's husband, Raja Abdullah. Jelasin Fort Believed to be located on the eastern banks of the Kelantan River, the fort was made from thick wood with beautiful carvings and was very famous during the reign of Che Siti. It was used to defend Kelantan from outside attacks. According to history, Jelasin Fort was attacked by the King of Siam and Puteri Saadong disappeared after that. The condition of the fort soon deteriorated after her disappearance and the ruins of the fort is hardly noticeable nowadays as not much effort has been taken to conserve it. Jelasin Fort Succession Legend has it that Che Siti never died but instead \\"disappeared\\" into the mystical world, and reappears from time to time. After her \\"disappearance\\", she was succeeded by her adopted daughter, Puteri Saadong, who was the youngest daughter of Raja Jembal.

On 15 September 1940, Holmes saved Buckingham Palace from being hit by German bombing, when he used his Hawker Hurricane to destroy a Dornier Do 17 bomber over London by ramming.'Those Other Eagles', Shores, (2004) He was feted by the press as a war hero for his saving of Buckingham Palace. The British pilot became a King's Messenger after the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005. Early life Raymond Towers Holmes was born on August 20, 1914 in Wallasey, Cheshire to Mabel Annie Holmes (n√©e Latham) and journalist Christopher Holmes. He attended Wallasey and Calday Grange Grammar School and worked as a crime journalist at the Birkenhead Advertiser before joining the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1936 as their 55th volunteer. Second World War =Battle of Britain= In June 1940 he joined No. 504 Squadron RAF. He became known among his flight comrades as ‚ÄúArty‚Äù which was taken from the initials of his name R.T. Rudolf Heitsch's Dornier Do 17 in Castle Farm Shoreham. The flame throwing device is just visible on the aft fuselage.Goss 2000, p. 152. The device had not been tested at high altitude and when used, squirted black oil over Holmes' windshield and attracted the attention of British fighters. The Do 17 was shot down by John Dundas and his wingman. On 15 September 1940, known as Battle of Britain Day, Sergeant Holmes was flying a Hawker Hurricane fighter when he spotted a formation of three Dornier Do 17 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 76 heading for central London, to make a bombing attempt. As he made an attack on one of the bombers, the bomber fired a flamethrower at him, and Holmes' windscreen was covered in oil.Battle of Britain: July‚ÄìOctober 1940 - An Oral History of Britain's 'Finest Hour', Matthew Parker, p. 292. The flamethrower, obviously intended for use on the ground, was not working properly at 16,000 feet, giving a jet of flame only some 100 yards long. The oil had not caught fire, and it was this that had found its way onto the Hurricane. Knowing that the airflow would clear the oil away, Ray Holmes waited for his view to be restored. As his windscreen cleared Ray realised that he was dangerously close to the Dornier, and ramming the stick forward, passed beneath the bomber. > I made my attack on this bomber and he spurted out a lot of oil, just a > great stream over my aeroplane. blotting out my windscreen.

Robert Zehbe's Dornier falling on Victoria Station after being rammed by Ray Holmes, 15 September 1940. Holmes then spotted the third Dornier still heading onwards, making directly for Buckingham Palace. Avoiding the bomber's machine gunfire, Holmes quickly climbed ahead of it, then swung around to make a head- on attack on the Dornier. However upon firing discovered his machine guns failed. Holmes decided to ram the bomber hoping his plane could withstand the impact and cut through it. He flew his plane into the top-side of the German bomber, cutting off the rear tail section with his wing. > As I fired, my ammunition gave out. I thought, Hell, he's got away now.

On the ground, the event was captured on film, and witnessed by a large group of people in nearby Hyde Park. Jimmy Earley was playing football at the corner of Ebury Bridge Road, near Victoria station. The air-raid siren had gone off, but as usual he and his friends ignored it. Suddenly they heard gunfire. Earley recalled, \\"We ran up to the Ebury Bridge and I can remember the Hurricane seemed to go underneath the Dornier, which split and all of sudden - wallop! - it came down in no time. Obviously the Hurricane pilot had no care for his own safety, he couldn't have done. He just hit it and the back of it came off.\\" Holmes' own plane began to dive to the left, and was no longer responding to the controls. As the Hurricane went into a vertical dive, Holmes bailed out. As he climbed out, the air-stream caught him and smacked him down on to the roof of the Hurricane. Then, as he was thrown backwards, his shoulder hit his own tail fin. When he finally managed to pull his ripcord, the jolt shook off his flying boots and he found himself swinging violently about. He could see the Dornier dive out of control and crash near Victoria tube station. The pilot of the Dornier, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. The Observer of the aircraft, Unteroffizier Hans Goschenhofer, and Gunner, Unteroffizier Gustav Hobel, did not survive the crash. However, Radio Operator, Gefreiter Ludwig Armbruster, bailed out over Syndenham, and Flight Engineer, Unteroffizier Leo Hammermeister, bailed out over Dulwich. Jim Earley watched Holmes' Hurricane crash twenty yards from where they had been playing football, near the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Earley recalled, \\"As soon as it hit the road, it went straight down and burst the water main. Water was all over the place, my feet were soaked.\\" Holmes came down in a narrow back garden, and ended up dangling inside an empty dustbin.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this- britain/unearthed-story-of-the-ww2-pilot-who-saved-the-palace-562669.html > I got hold of the guy ropes and stopped the spinning and looked down.

Calmly, Holmes undid the parachute harness and dusted himself down. In the next garden were two girls who had seen him come down. Holmes recalled, \\"I went over the fence and we all kissed each other\\". Jim Earley recalled the ecstatic crowd that greeted the downed pilot as he made his way out into the street. \\"The blokes were shaking his hand, but it was mostly women gathered around him. I wish it had been me, they all cuddled him and kissed him. Then he was carried over their heads towards Chelsea Barracks. Everybody was touching him as he was taken over the bridge. You know, I don't think he wanted to go to Chelsea Barracks, I think he wanted to stay where he was being made a fuss off!\\" Holmes was feted by the press as a war hero for his saving of Buckingham Palace. As the RAF did not practice ramming as an air combat tactic, this was considered an impromptu manoeuvre, and an act of selfless courage. This event became one of the defining moments of the Battle of Britain and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who had witnessed the event.\\"Alfred Keith Ogilvie Battle of Britain Pilot with 609 Squadron.\\" lycos.co.uk. Retrieved: 25 July 2009. The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. =Later activities= When recovered, he became part of No 81 Squadron, and was sent to the Northern Front near Murmansk in Soviet Russia to help train the Russian air force in flying the Hawker Hurricane. Here he claimed a further kill; a Bf 109 F. He married Elizabeth Killip in April 1941 and was commissioned as a Pilot Officer on 10 June 1941, promoted to Flying Officer on 10 June 1942, and Flight Lieutenant on 10 June 1943. Returning from Russia, Holmes served as an instructor with 2 FIS, Montrose, from 1942 until 1944. He then flew PR Spitfires with 541 Squadron from February 1945. Post-war =Personal life= After the war, he was a King's Messenger, personally delivering mail for British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. After leaving the RAF in late 1945, he returned to journalism, joining his father's news agency covering Liverpool Crown Court for local and national newspapers. He had two daughters with his wife, Elizabeth, who died in 1964. He later married Anne Holmes in 1966, with whom he had two children: a son and a daughter. In 1989, he published his autobiography entitled Sky Spy: From Six Miles High to Hitler's Bunker. 65 years later, the wreckage of Holmes' Hurricane was discovered and successfully excavated from the streets of London. The discovery was featured on the National Geographic Channel documentary, \\"The Search for the Lost Fighter Plane\\". He was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Wirral in January 2005. He died on 27 June 2005, aged 90 at Hoylake Cottage Hospital, following a two-year battle with cancer. He was buried in Rake Lane Cemetery, Wallasey. In popular culture The Edward Fox character \\"Pilot Officer Archie\\", in the film Battle of Britain, was based on Holmes. Holmes also was mentioned in an episode of Battlefield Britain.

She had an international career as a guest singer on the opera houses of Europe and was a member of the Bavarian State Opera from 1961 to 1973. Her signature roles were the Queen of the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te and Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos by Richard Strauss. She created roles including Scolatella in Henze's K√∂nig Hirsch. Early career Born in Munich, Hallstein studied with her mother, Elisabeth Hallstein, and debuted at the opera house in Passau, Germany, in 1957 as Musetta in Puccini's La boh√®me. After engagements at the Theater Basel and the Staatstheater am G√§rtnerplatz in Munich she made her Salzburg Festival debut in 1960 as Rosina in Mozart's La finta semplice. The same year she joined the Bavarian State Opera, a full member there from 1961 to 1973. She created the role of Scolatella in the revised version of Henze's K√∂nig Hirsch in Kassel in 1963, and Autonoe in his Die Bassariden at the 1966 Salzburg Festival. International career In the following years, Hallstein appeared as a guest to important opera houses in the world, including Deutsche Oper Berlin, Hamburg State Opera, La Fenice in Venice, and the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. She also sang at the Royal Opera House in London with Otto Klemperer and first sang one of her signature roles for the reopening of the Theater an der Wien, the Queen of the Night in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te, conducted by Herbert von Karajan. Her voice was well focused and she was capable of commanding dramatic phrasing and emotional expression. In opera, she sang some of the most demanding roles in the coloratura Fach. Her signature role was Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos by Richard Strauss. Her repertoire of around 60 roles included Mozart's Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro and the title role in his Zaide, Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto and the title role of his La traviata, and Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss. She also devoted herself to the lied, giving recitals in Germany and abroad. Teaching In 1979, Hallstein was appointed professor at the Musikhochschule W√ºrzburg where she taught until 2006. After initial doubts, teaching became her new passion and she decided to retire from stage and concentrate on the young talents. She has given master classes in Germany and abroad and is a sought-after juror for international singing competitions. Recordings, films and television An exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon resulted in numerous recordings of operas, operettas and songs. These recordings display an artist who had an uncanny sense of sophistication in terms of ornamentation and a fearless bravura approach to the most daring virtuoso pieces. Besides her very successful stage career, she also achieved great popularity during the 1960s and 1970s when she appeared in many operetta films such as Die Zirkusprinzessin or Wiener Blut, and musical television shows. Awards She received the title of a Bavarian Kammers√§ngerin and the Federal Cross of Merit in 1979, that order's First Class in 1996, and the Bavarian Order of Merit in 1999.

It operated by the Cassiar Asbestos Corporation, which also operated the asbestos mine in Cassiar, British Columbia, from 1966 to 1978, when it was closed and the buildings auctioned off. Road access was available via a road that joined with Yukon Highway 3, known since 1978 as Yukon territorial highway 9, the Top of the World Highway. Mining product was transported across the Yukon River at Dawson City by ferry in summer, ice road in winter, and by a tram system in the spring and fall. At the time, at least some Dawson City residents demanded that a bridge be built. The community was fairly well served, with dial telephone service, and it was one of the only six communities in Yukon with television service before 1973. Clinton Creek had a population of 500, a main building housing the post office, grocery store, cafeteria (used mainly for mine workers), and the remaining rooms served for community social gatherings like a projector set up for weekly reel movies, and a snack bar. Upon the closing of the townsite, many residents dispersed to other mining towns like Cassiar, British Columbia, and Faro, Yukon. Although the townsite is now abandoned, the road is passable to allow access to the historic ghost town of Fortymile, which was itself abandoned around 1898 when Dawson City boomed. Fortymile was the location of a mining office where the Klondike gold strike claim was registered by George Carmack and his two relatives, Dawson Charlie and Skookum Jim Mason.

Lucas. See was a Filipino revolutionary and statesman. Pre-war life √Ålvarez was born in Noveleta, Cavite. He received formal schooling at the San Jos√© College in Manila, and obtained a teacher's diploma. He returned to Cavite and worked as a schoolteacher in Naic and Maragondon. In 1871, he was incarcerated and tortured by the colonial authorities after insulting a Spanish soldier. The following year, he was accused of involvement in the Cavite Mutiny and was hauled to Manila in chains for detention. Upon his eventual release, he returned to Noveleta, and in 1881, was elected capitan municipal, a position he held until the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896. Revolutionary general √Ålvarez and his son Santiago were active members of the Katipunan, the anti-Spanish secret society founded by Andr√©s Bonifacio in 1892. Mariano was the uncle of Bonifacio's wife, Gregoria de Jes√∫s. In early 1896, √Ålvarez was elected president of the Magdiwang, one of two Katipunan branches in Cavite along with Magdalo. The two branches evolved into separate factions with their own local governments, through their provincial councils. √Ålvarez helped facilitate growing membership of the Katipunan in Cavite. When the revolution started in August 1896, Bonifacio at least planned to give him overall command of all the revolutionary forces in Cavite. A draft of the appointment order survives but whether it was dispatched is uncertain. He led Filipino forces in several battles against the Spanish army in Cavite and held the rank of general. His efforts helped liberate most towns in Cavite from Spanish control within weeks from the start of the revolt. He was recognized as the instigator of the revolution in Cavite. Rivalry and tension existed between the Magdiwang and Magdalo factions over jurisdiction and authority, and √Ålvarez, as Magdiwang head, invited Bonifacio, as Presidente Supremo (\\"Supreme President\\") of the Katipunan, to meditate over them. Bonifacio was seen as partial to the Magdiwang probably due to his kinship ties with √Ålvarez. In their memoirs, Emilio Aguinaldo and other Magdalo personages claim that Bonifacio became the head of the Magdiwang, receiving the title Hari ng Bayan (‚ÄúKing of the People‚Äù) with √Ålvarez as his second-in-command. However, no documentary sources have been found substantiating these claims. Instead it has been suggested that these claims stem from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of one of Bonifacio‚Äôs titles, Pangulo ng Haring Bayan (‚ÄúPresident of the Sovereign Nation‚Äù). In his own memoirs, Santiago √Ålvarez clearly distinguishes between the Magdiwang government and the Supreme Council of the Katipunan headed by Bonifacio. The dispute between the Magdiwang and Magdalo soon involved the issue of command of the revolution. The Magdalo called for the abolition of the Katipunan and the establishment of a revolutionary government. Bonifacio and the Magdiwang maintained the Katipunan was already their government. After losing the internal power struggle to Aguinaldo, Bonifacio was executed in 1897. √Ålvarez was aggrieved by Bonifacio's death, and, like Emilio Jacinto, refused to join the forces of Aguinaldo, who had then retreated to Biak-na-Bato in Bulacan. Personal life In May 1863, he married Nicolasa Virata y del Rosario; their only child, Santiago, also a revolutionary general, was born on July 25, 1872 in Imus. Later life The United States of America soon gained control over the Philippines following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. √Ålvarez affiliated himself with the pro-independence Nacionalista Party and was among the signatories of the party's constitution. He won election as municipal president of Noveleta. √Ålvarez joined the nationalist-oriented Philippine Independent Church founded by Isabelo de los Reyes and Gregorio Aglipay in 1902. He retired to his farm following his term as municipal president, and died on August 25, 1924 from chronic rheumatism at the age of 106. The municipality of Gen. Mariano Alvarez, Cavite, established in 1981, was named in his honor.

Operating in New York City in the late 1840s, a genteelly dressed Thompson would approach an upper- class mark, pretending they knew each other, and begin a brief conversation. After initially gaining the mark's trust, Thompson would ask whether he had the confidence to lend Thompson his watch. Upon taking the watch, Thompson would depart, never returning the watch. Thompson used various aliases including Samuel Thompson, James Thompson, Samuel Thomas, Samuel Powel, Samuel Williams, William Evans, Samuel Willis, William Davis, and William Brown.

In phonology In phonology, segments are categorized into natural classes on the basis of their distinctive features. Each feature is a quality or characteristic of the natural class, such as voice or manner. A unique combination of features defines a phoneme. Examples of phonemic or distinctive features are: [+/- voice ], [+/- ATR ] (binary features) and [ CORONAL ] (a unary feature; also a place feature). Surface representations can be expressed as the result of rules acting on the features of the underlying representation. These rules are formulated in terms of transformations on features. In morphology and syntax In morphology and syntax, words are often organized into lexical categories or word classes, such as \\"noun\\", \\"verb\\", \\"adjective\\", and so on. These word classes have grammatical features (also called categories or inflectional categories), which can have one of a set of potential values (also called the property, meaning, or feature of the category).Kibort, Anna & Corbett, Greville G. Grammatical Features - Feature Inventory For example, consider the pronoun in English. Pronouns are a lexical category. Pronouns have the person feature, which can have a value of \\"first\\", \\"second\\", or \\"third\\". English pronouns also have the number feature, which can have a value of either \\"singular\\" or \\"plural\\". As a result, we can describe the English pronoun \\"they\\" as a pronoun with [person:3] and [number:plural]. Third person singular pronouns in English also have a gender feature: \\"she\\" is [gender:feminine], \\"he\\" [gender:masculine] and \\"it [gender:neuter]. Different lexical categories realise or are specified for different grammatical features: for example, verbs in English are specified for tense, aspect and mood features, as well as person and number. The features that a category realises can also differ from language to language. There is often a correspondence between morphological and syntactic features, in that certain features, such as person, are relevant to both morphology and syntax; these are known as morphosyntactic features. Other types of grammatical features, by contrast, may be relevant to semantics (morphosemantic features), such as tense, aspect and mood, or may only be relevant to morphology (morphological features). Inflectional class (a word's membership of a particular verb class or noun class) is a purely morphological feature, because it is only relevant to the morphological realisation of the word. In formal models of grammar, features can be represented as attribute- value pairs. For example, in Lexical functional grammar, syntactic features are represented alongside grammatical functions at the level of functional structure (f-structure), which takes the form of an attribute-value matrix. In semantics In semantics, words are categorized into semantic classes. Intersecting semantic classes share the same semantic features. Semantic features can include [¬±human] and [¬±animate]. These features may in some instances be realised morphologically, in which case they may also be called morphosemantic features.

The female lays her spherical eggs under the tips of the vine's leaves, one egg per leaf. = Larva = Early instar larva of Troides minos The caterpillars are voracious eaters but move very little; a small group will defoliate an entire vine. If starved due to overcrowding, the caterpillars may resort to cannibalism. Fleshy spine-like tubercles line the caterpillars' backs, and their bodies are dark red to brown and velvety black. Some species have tubercles of contrasting colours, often red, or pale \\"saddle\\" markings. Like other members of their family, birdwing caterpillars possess a retractable organ behind their heads called an osmeterium. Shaped like the forked tongue of a snake, the osmeterium excretes a fetid terpene- based compound and is deployed when the caterpillar is provoked. The caterpillars are also unappealing to most predators due to their toxicity: the vines which the caterpillars feed upon contain aristolochic acid, a poisonous compound known to be carcinogenic in rats. The feeding caterpillars incorporate and concentrate the aristolochic acid into their tissues, where the poison will persist through metamorphosis and into adulthood. = Pupa = Pupa of Ornithoptera victoriae Birdwing chrysalids are camouflaged to look like a dead leaf or twig. Before pupating, the caterpillars may wander considerable distances from their host plants. In O. alexandrae, it takes about four months to get from egg to adult. Barring predation, this species can also survive up to three months as an adult. = Imago = Birdwings inhabit rainforests and adults are usually glimpsed along the forest periphery. They feed upon--and are important long-range pollinators of-- nectar-bearing flowers of the forest canopy, as well as terrestrial flowers, such as lantana. They are strong flyers and seek sunlit spots in which to bask. Breeding behaviour varies little between species; the female's role is relatively passive, slowly fluttering from perch to perch while the male performs an elaborate, quivering yet stationary dance 20-50 cm above her. Copulating pair of Ornithoptera euphorion (female above, male below). The sexes are quite dissimilar in appearance, as is typical of species in the genus Ornithoptera. Birdwings are typified by large size (up to a maximum body length of 7.6 cm or 3 inches and a wingspan of 28 cm or 11 inches in O. alexandrae), showy colouration (in contrasting shades of green, yellow, black, white, and sometimes blue or orange), and slender, lanceolate forewings. With few exceptions (i.e., the New Guinean O. meridionalis and O. paradisea), the hindwings lack tails. Sexual dimorphism is strong in Ornithoptera species only, where males are black combined with bright iridescent green, blue, orange, or yellow while the larger and less colourful females are overall black or dark brownish with white, pale brown, or yellow markings. Males and females of most Troides birdwings are similar and have jet black to brown dorsal forewings, often with the veins bordered in grey to creamy white. At least one of these darkly-coloured species (T. rhadamantus) possesses thermoreceptors on the anal veins (A2 and A3) of the wings and on the antennal clubs. The antennal receptors of the clubs--which also possess hygroreceptors that measure atmospheric humidity--are known as sensilla basiconica. The thermoreceptors are sensitive to sudden increases in temperature; they are thought to help the butterfly thermoregulate and avoid overheating while basking. The colours of most species are pigmentary (via papiliochrome); but two species, Troides magellanus and the much rarer T. prattorum, are noted for their use of limited-view iridescence: the yellow of the dorsal hindwings is modified by bright blue-green iridescence which is only seen when the butterfly is viewed at a narrow, oblique angle. This \\"grazing iridescence\\" is brought about through diffraction of light (after back-reflection) by the wings' extremely steeply-set, multilayered rib-like scales (rather than the ridge-lamellae of most other iridescent butterflies, such as Morpho species). Such limited-view iridescence was previously only known from one other species, the riodinid Ancyluris meliboeus. In A. meliboeus, however, the iridescence is produced by ridge-lamellar scales and features a wider range of colours. The close evolutionary relationship between Troides and Ornithoptera butterflies is well demonstrated by the fact that commercial breeders have produced numerous hybrids between the two. The final and smallest genus is Trogonoptera with just two species. They resemble each other, being overall black with iridescent green markings and a red head. Females are duller than males.  Distribution  Birdwings are generally found from Southeast Asia to northern Australasia. Trogonoptera brookiana inhabits the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Natuna, Sumatra, and various surrounding islands.The World of Birdwing Butterflies. Trogonoptera brookiana. Accessed 20 May 2012ARKive Rajah Brooke‚Äôs birdwing. Accessed 20 May 2012 Trogonoptera trojana is endemic to Palawan in the Philippines. Troides species are distributed widely across the Indomalayan realm, but may be found as far east as New Guinea in the case of Troides oblongomaculatus. Some species may be found as far west as India, and are the westernmost distributed of all birdwings. All Ornithoptera species are found in the northern portion of the Australasian realm, east of Weber's line; the Moluccas, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and northeastern Australia.Ngypalnet An outlier is Ornithoptera richmondia, which may be found in far northeastern New South Wales, Australia in the southernmost area of its range; the southernmost distribution of all birdwings.  Status and protection  O. alexandrae has a very small distribution and is the only birdwing on Appendix I of CITES With the exception of Queen Alexandra's birdwing (O. alexandrae), all birdwings are listed in Appendix II of CITES, and accordingly their trade is restricted in countries that have signed the CITES convention. Exceptions are made for captive-reared specimens, which mainly originate from ranches in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (2007). Review of trade in ranched birdwing butterflies. European Commission, 2008. Most species of all three genera have now been reared in captivity, though with significant differences in the quantities reared of each species. O. alexandrae is listed on Appendix I and therefore cannot legally be traded internationally. At the 2006 meeting of the CITES Animals Committee some suggested O. alexandrae should be moved to Appendix II, as the conservation benefits of sustainable management perhaps are higher than those of the trade ban.CITES (2006). Earth Negotiations Bulletin. Summary of the 22nd Meeting of the CITES Animals Committee. Three Troides and eight Ornithoptera species have been given assessments by the IUCN Red List, with classifications ranging from \\"least concern\\" to \\"endangered\\".IUCN Red List , entries for Troides and Ornithoptera. Richmond birdwings (O. richmondia) depend on the plant Aristolochia praevenosa which they need for their caterpillars. However, the very similar Aristolochia elegans (Dutchman's pipe) which can be found in many Australian backyards, kills the caterpillars. Reproduction Ornithoptera, or the genus of birdwing butterflies, usually reproduce sexually and are oviparous.Straatman, R. Hybridisation of Birdwing Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) In Papua New Guinea. The Lepidopterological Society of Japan. Ty√¥ to Ga (Transactions of the Lepidopterological Society of Japan) Vol. 27, No, 4 1976 156-162. In butterflies sex is determined by a WW/WZ system, with a heterogametic female, reverse of that found in mammals and many other insects, which have a heterogametic male.Nielsen, J. (2010). A Review of Synandromorphism in the Genus Ornithoptera Boisduval, (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). Australian Entomologist, 37(3): 105-112. During copulation males will transfer an ejaculate containing both sperm and accessory substances that can make up to fifteen percent of a males body mass. Mating systems Mating systems, first explored in evolutionary terms by Darwin, includes all behaviours associated with sexual reproduction.Emlen ST, Oring LW. (1977). Ecology, sexual selection, and the evolution of mating systems. Science 197:215-223. Mating systems include all costs and benefits, pre- and postcopulatory competitions, displays and mate choice. Butterfly mating systems have great variation, including strict monandry, one male and one female, to polyandry, having many mates of the opposite sex. Typically Ornithoptera tend to be polygamous, mating with more than one individual. =Female choice= Female choice can have a serious impact on mate selection and successful reproduction. Several species of Ornithoptera have been known to create hybrids if they have no access to their own species. Troides oblongamaculatus females have been known to choose to mate with other species such as Ornithoptera priamus poseidon, which will attempt mating if their own species is not to be found near by. The females will typically resist mating attempts by covering their abdomen with their forewings or dropping to the ground, making mating near impossible. Although the females usually resist these mating attempts, they have been noted to be more susceptible if they have not had previous encounters with males of their own species. =Male courtship= Some male Ornithoptera species demonstrate courtship behaviour. Ornithoptera priamus posedion males will approach a female carefully, and examine the female for several minutes. After consideration, the male may choose to hover twenty to thirty centimeters above the female, displaying the bright yellow marking on its hindwings. Meanwhile, the forewings will move forward, exposing the abdomen and androconial hair tufts. Mating is only attempted when the female has ceased to flap her wings.Orr, A. (1999). Possible Postcopulatory Mate Guarding in Ornithopter Euphorion (Gray) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). Australian Entomologist, 26 (3): 71-76. After about thirty seconds of the display, the male will attempt copulation. =Cryptic choice: sperm competition and postcopulatory guarding= In many animals, females often mate with more than one male.Satoh, Y. Yano, S. Takafuji, A. Mating strategy of spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) males: postcopulatory guarding to assure paternity. (2001). Applied Entomology, 36 (1): 41-45. Males who are able will adapt strategies such as postcopulatory guarding to ensure the paternity of the offspring. Following insemination, it is common for the male Ornithoptera to produce a mating plug, which will seal the ostium bursae and prevent remating by the female, as new sperm is unable to enter the opening. The plug does not impede oviposition and may stay in place for the duration of the female's life. =Sexual dimorphism= Sexual dimorphism is very prominent in Ornithoptera species, the males being black with brightly colored markings of blue, green, orange or yellow and the females are overall black or dark brown.Wilts, B. D., Matsushita, A., Arikawa, K., & Stavenga, D. G. (2015). Spectrally tuned structural and pigmentary coloration of birdwing butterfly wing scales. Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 12(111), 20150717. http://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0717 The sexual dichromatism functions in mate recognition by the use of photoreceptors. Due to the protected nature of Ornithoptera it has been difficult to study the spectral sensitivities of the sexes although this difference in coloration alludes to the idea of sensory exploitation of the female's photoreceptors. The sensory bias of females to select for males with brighter wings has yet to be studied in Ornithoptera. Gyanandromorphism is a very rare condition in which an organism simultaneously expresses both male and female phenotypes. It is only observed in species that express strong sexual dimorphism. Gynandromorphs are suspected to be due to genetic errors associated with cell division such as nondisjunction, as well as fertilization of binucleate ova and fertilisation of multiple sperm that may fuse and act as a second nucleus. Ornithoptera is known to commonly exhibit this phenomenon, but little to no research has been successful in determining why. Those who experience this phenomenon, usually females, show male-pigmented tissues on their wings.  See also  * List of largest insects  Cited references   Other references  * d'Abrera, Bernard.

Zimmermann studied composition in Germany with Werner Heider and Mauricio Kagel, the theory of musical intelligence at the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht (now located in The Hague), and computer music at Colgate University in New York. Zimmermann's works are infused by a personal adaptation of minimal technique. Whereas many early American minimalist composers were influenced in their works by rock, jazz, and world musics, Zimmermann has drawn a great deal of inspiration from his Franconian heritage. A number of his works, particularly his groups of pieces known as Lokale Musik, use the traditional music of this area as source material. These works frequently begin with melodic material derived from Franconian folk songs, which are rearranged and transformed in novel ways. In 1976, Zimmermann published a collection of interviews with American musicians and composers entitled Desert Plants: Conversations With 23 American Musicians.

He was chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist- Leninist) (CPA(ML)) from 1964 to 1986.  History  Hill was born on 23 April 1915 in Mildura, Victoria to James and Alice Hill. He attended school at Hamilton High School, where his father was head teacher. After leaving school he worked as a clerk for Bill Slater a local barrister who was also the local Labor Member of Parliament. In 1933 he moved to Melbourne to study law at the University of Melbourne. Despite being awarded for his academic knowledge he did not finish his legal degree until 1981. It was during his time at the university that he joined the Communist Party of Australia (CPA). He was admitted to practice as a barrister and solicitor in 1938 and soon became well known as the CPA's leading legal figure, defending the party and its members in several well-known trials. In 1951 he advised Frank Hardy in his prosecution for criminal libel over his novel Power Without Glory. Hill also represented the CPA before the 1947 Royal Commission into Communism and the 1954 Royal Commission into alleged Soviet espionage in Australia (see Petrov Affair). = Split = Ted Hill (holding book) meeting with Mao Zedong during his visit to China in 1968. In the 1950s, Hill was Victorian State Secretary of the CPA. When the Sino-Soviet split developed in the early 1960s, Hill supported the position of the Communist Party of China, while the CPA majority, led by National Secretary Lance Sharkey supported the Soviet Union. Hill was expelled from the CPA in 1963 and in March 1964 formed the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) (CPA(ML)), taking many militant members from the Victorian CPA with him. Among ordinary Australian voters, the attraction of Hill's party was negligible. Ted Hill had broken with the Moscow-oriented Communist Party of Australia, to found the rival, Peking- backed Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist). Among ordinary Australian voters, the attraction of Hill's party was negligible Hill fully supported the \\"line\\" of the Chinese Communists until Mao Zedong's death in 1976, but after the 1972 change in Chinese policy away from world revolution and towards an alliance with the United States, the CPA(ML) lost many of its adherents, particularly among radical students. Hill traveled to Democratic Kampuchea and met with Pol Pot. After the rise of Deng Xiaoping in China the CPA(ML) no longer supported Chinese policies, and became a supporter of \\"Australian independence.\\" This led to a split in the CPA(ML) in 1978. Despite his prominence as a Communist, Hill was able to pursue a long and distinguished legal career, as one of the best known and highly regarded workers compensation lawyers in Australia. He was widely praised by trade unions, judges and other lawyers, most of whom did not share his political views, on his death in 1988.

It is famous for the Highland Bowl, which provides what some consider some of the most intense skiing in the state. The Aspen Skiing Company operates Aspen Highlands. History Aspen Highlands was founded and the land developed in 1958 by Aspen resident Whip Jones. In 1993 Jones donated it to his Alma Mater, Harvard University. Harvard sold the resort to Houston, Texas developer Gerald D. Hines for $18.3 million. It later became part of the Aspen Skiing Company. The mountain Aspen Highlands has become most famous for the Highland Bowl and other experts only terrain. However, the Bowl wasn't completely opened until 2002. Most of the mountain's terrain flows off of the narrow ridge extending from Highland Peak. =Mid and lower mountain terrain= View of Cloud Nine Rolling wide intermediate trails through thick lodgepole pine forest constitute most of the mid-to-lower mountain terrain. The very bottom of the mountain is dominated by the Thunderbowl, an expansive steep intermediate run that normally hosts most of the ski competitions on the mountain. The lower mountain also contains challenging expert runs such as Lower Stein, Golden Horn Woods, and The P-Chutes. It is served by the Exhibition and Thunderbowl lifts. The Mid-Mountain area is anchored by the 60s era Merry-Go-Round restaurant, with a large, south-facing deck. The Merry-Go- Round also serves as the hub of the major chairlifts on mountain. The Cloud Nine lift serves primarily intermediate and difficult runs on the mid-mountain as well as Scarlett's, a mogul run. The summit of Cloud Nine lift is the location of Cloud Nine Bistro, with views of the Maroon Bells. As of December 2017, Aspen Highlands has changed its trail map so that there is no more beginner terrain. This is presumably to encourage novice skiers to go to Buttermilk or Snowmass. =Upper mountain terrain= What attracts most skiers to Highlands is the dramatic, just-above-timberline summit of the mountain. The upper mountain is primarily served by the Loge Peak high speed quad originating at the Merry-Go-Round. The ridge that extends down from Loge Peak (the lift-served summit) has only one intermediate run, Broadway, which follows the ridge spine. On the skiers right side is Steeplechase, an area of long and steep terrain with some runs reaching upwards of 45 degrees. Farther down is the Olympic bowl which contains steep slopes in and out of glades. Views of the Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak, Hayden Mountain, and the Highland Bowl greet skiers at the summit. =The Highland Bowl= Since 2002, the Highland Bowl has been the crown jewel of Aspen Highlands. Most of the terrain is accessed only by hiking from the top of Loge Peak, although a snowcat can cut the distance by a third. Including the hike-to terrain in Highland Bowl, Highlands' skiable vertical descent increases to . The Highlands ski patrol monitors the Bowl and conducts avalanche control for skier safety. The Bowl faces primarily east, towards Aspen Mountain. Generally, the best snow to be found is in the north-facing G-Zones (\\"G\\" corresponds to green ski wax, for the coldest temperature snow). The B-Zones (for blue wax) face east and descend down the center of the bowl from the summit of Highland Peak. The south-facing Y-Zones (yellow wax), are the steepest, with slopes as steep as 48 degrees, according to Aspen Highlands trail maps. These can be skied without hiking. Prior to the construction of the Deep Temerity lift in 2005, a run down the Highland Bowl required then taking the Grand Traverse, a long, flat catwalk, to get back to the Loge Peak lift. The Highland Bowl also offers access from the summit into the steep and highly avalanche prone backcountry Five Fingers Bowl. On March 31, 1984, ski patrolmen Chris Kessler, Tom Snyder, and Craig Soddy were completing avalanche control work in Highland Bowl. The three set off explosive charges near the top of the Bowl. Their bombs yielded no sign of danger and they continued to do explosive work. Their second explosion triggered a slide and before the three could escape an avalanche fell from above them. All three died. A monument in their memory has been erected near the top of the Loge Peak lift above the ski runs named in their honor (Kessler's Bowl, Snyder's Ridge, and Soddbuster). =Terrain aspects= * North: 50% * West: 15% * East: 35% New terrain Just before the 2005-2006 season The Aspen Skiing Company completed work on the new fixed grip triple lift \\"Deep Temerity\\".

The novel is about a writer named Sidney Orr (a short, Americanized version of the Polish surname Orlovsky), who, after making a miraculous recovery from near fatal illness, buys a new notebook and starts writing a story about a man who completely changed his life when he realised how much his existence was ruled by randomness. The base premises for the book is this, Sidney Orr trying to come back to his life and begin writing again, but a lot of things happen in his life at the same time, and the reader gets introduced not only to Sidney's work and personal life, but also in some extent to the life of the person in his work-in-progress novel. Before the end of this period in Sidney's life, events will take place that are truly life-altering, and Sidney will, much like the fictional character he writes of, have to deal with issues and questions he has previously (perhaps unconsciously) been avoiding for several years. Biographical The main character, Sidney Orr, is in many ways quite similar to Paul Auster. They are both residents of Brooklyn, middle-aged, married, and, of course, writers. Some similarities between Auster and a supporting character in Oracle Night‚ÄîJohn Trause‚Äîare also apparent. Trause, an anagram of Auster, also lived in Paris for a period of his life.

State and private media operators provide services in the main languages Sinhala, Tamil and English. The government owns two major TV stations, radio networks operated by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), and newspaper titles in Sinhala, Tamil, and English. After the growth of Sri Lankan economy, many satellite TV channels were introduced. However, there are over a dozen privately owned radio stations and more than 30 privately operated television stations. They often engage in political debates. The use of the internet is a growing force within Sri Lanka, many of the newspapers now have online editions. Because of the limited circulation for the daily and weekly newspapers, they are heavily dependent on advertising. As a result of this it is very rare to see Sri Lankan newspapers engage in investigative journalism or daring expos√©s of big business. Press freedom Press freedom is a major concern in Sri Lanka. Both sides in the war make efforts to silence inconvenient reporters. Around 15 reporters received death threats from one faction or the other in 2004. The assassinated reporter Aiyathurai Nadesan, correspondent in Batticaloa for several Tamil media stated just prior to his assassination in 2005: > We are caught between a rock and a hard place. It is very difficult for us > to check reports either with the security forces or the Tamil Tigers. And > when a news item on local events is datelined Colombo, it puts us at risk of > reprisals on the ground. In 2005, the Tamil newspaper Thinakkural was threatened by Karuna. Copies of the newspaper were burned in the Eastern provinces. On the other hand, distribution of the Tamil weekly Thinamurasu is blocked by the LTTE because it is close to another armed group, the EPDP. BBC World Service stopped its broadcast in Sinhalese and Tamil for fear of reprisal against its reporters. During the Rajapaksa administration, press freedom in Sri Lanka became the \\"worst in any democratic country\\", according to the Reporters without borders index, ranking 165th among 173 countries in the index. On 21 November 2008, a twelve-member group of masked men, forcibly entered the printing press of Sunday Leader, Morning Leader and Irudina Sinhala weekly and set fire damaging printing machines and copies of newspapers printed ready for distribution. The state jammed transmission of BBC programs which contained content the government disliked.http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2008/12/081212_rsf_bbc.shtml The main private TV network Sirasa was repeatedly threatened by minister Mervyn Silva, attacked by a petrol bomb on 2.1.2009 and raided by gunmen on 6.1.2009, who set on fire the main control room. This was in response to SLBC criticizing Sirasa's coverage of the capture of Kilinochchi. According to the head of the company, Chevaan Daniel: \\"It's either that the citizens of Sri Lanka are able to drive around attacking institutions armed with weapons and grenades, or there is a hand behind it.\\" Lasantha Wickrematunge, the chief editor of the English Weekly Sunday Leader and Sri Lanka's most influential journalist, was assassinated on the Thursday January 8, 2009 by unknown gunmen. The newspaper and its editor as well as the editor of Morning Leader have been harassed and threatened continuously during the preceding three years. All Leader publications are very critical towards the government and exponents of opposition political views.http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2009/01/090108_lasantha.shtml According to Reporters without Borders, the Rajapaksa administration blocks investigations into the murder of journalists. Defence minister Gotabhaya Rajapaksa threatened to chase Chris Morris, a BBC journalists, out of the country, if he does not act responsibly. Local reporters in the country continue to be threatened, as was the case with 54-year-old M.I. Rahmathulla, who was beaten in April 2009 for reporting on political corruption in the Batticaloa region of Sri Lanka's Eastern Province.Risking Lives for Information Exchange Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting Print media =Newspapers= Important English language newspapers are the Sunday Leader Daily FT, Daily Mirror, the Daily News, Sunday Observer and The Island. Sinhalese newspapers are Dinamina, Lankadeepa, Lakbima, and Divaena. Tamil newspapers are Uthayan, 'Tamil Mirror Thinakaran, Thinakkural, Sudar Oli, Metro and Virakesari. =Magazines and other periodicals= Broadcasting =Radio= Radio broadcasting in Sri Lanka dates back to 1923. Radio broadcasting, like other forms of media in the country, is generally divided along linguistic lines with state and private media operators providing services in Sinhala, Tamil, and English language. =Television= The first Television network of Sri Lanka was launched on 13 April 1979. The ITN channel, owned by the Independent Television Network Limited (ITN) became the first terrestrial television channel of Sri Lanka.ITN Sri Lanka, About Us On June 5, 1979 ITN was converted to a government owned business and was later brought under the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Act of 1982 along with the newly created Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC).Press reference, SRI LANKA Press, Media, TV, Radio, Newspapers Significant changes occurred in 1992 as the government permitted the establishment of private television networks. Subsequently, the Maharaja Television Network (MTV) was launched in collaboration with Singapore Telecommunications Limited (SingTel). Since then many new television networks have come into existence within Sri Lanka. There are also a number of Satellite networks and pay per view television networks in Sri Lanka such as Dialog TV which boasts over one million subscribers in the country. The national telecommunications provider Sri Lanka Telecom also launched an IPTV service in 2008. Film Sri Lankan cinema is a fledgling industry that has struggled to find a footing since its inauguration in 1947. Sri Lankan films are usually made in the Sinhalese language, the language of the majority Sinhala people. In the first nine years most films were made in South India and followed the conventions of Indian cinema. Studio shooting was the norm, with Indian style sets erected in film studios. Even though it is popularly held that Rekava, made in 1956 by pioneer director Lester James Peries, was the first Sinhala film to be shot completely out of studio, it was really the film \\"Gambada Sundari\\", made in 1950 which was the first film shot outside studios. It was also the first Sri Lankan film where, like in \\"Rekawa\\", the dialog was recorded on the spot. This was because the film was shot on 16mm, using an Auricon sound-on-film camera which recorded the sound on the 16mm film optically, unlike in the case of where the sound was recorded on a Kinevox 35mm magnetic recorder. The film was later 'blown-up' to 35mm and was screened in Colombo in 1950. Though \\"Rekawa\\" was acclaimed by local and international critics, the film failed to find an audience in the country and was a box office failure. Films continued to follow formulaic storylines borrowed from India up through the early 60s despite such efforts as Sandesaya and Kurulu Bedda. Artists such as Tissa Abeysekara, Dr. D.B.Nihalsingha, Prasanna Vithanage and Vimukthi Jayasundara have attempted to breathe new life into the industry. Nihalsingha was an accomplished cinematographer as well as an editor: so his films has an input which was special and brought a viewpoint to all his films, most of which focused on the exploited women. Vithanage's film Purahanda Kaluwara is widely considered one of the best movies made in Sri Lanka as is Jayasundara's Sulanga Enu Pinisa which won the coveted Camera d'Or for best first film at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. In recent years, films have begun to tackle gritty subjects such as family relationships, abortion and results of the conflict between the military and Tamil Tiger rebels in the north. Director Asoka Handagama especially has drawn criticism for pursuing such material in his work. Internet Numerous websites covering a wide range of topics, in addition to news and current affairs, exists. While all major newspaper have a web presence, many Sri Lankans turn to independent web publishers for their digital media needs.

It is found in these states of Brazil: Alagoas, Bahia, Esp√≠rito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Para√≠ba, Pernambuco, Paran√°, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, S√£o Paulo, and Sergipe. Common names include Brazilian peppertree, aroeira, rose pepper, broadleaved pepper tree, wilelaiki (or wililaiki), Christmasberry tree Schinus terebinthifolius at Instituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Florestais and Florida holly. The species name has been very commonly misspelled as \\"terebinthifolius\\", due to considerable historic confusion as to the correct gender of the genus name; as of 2015 this has been resolved with the determination that the correct gender of Schinus is feminine (rather than masculine), and adjectival names within the genus must be spelled accordingly.Zona, S. (2015). The correct gender of Schinus (Anacardiaceae). Phytotaxa, 222(1), 75‚Äì77. doi:https://doi.org/10.11646/phytotaxa.222.1.9 Description Brazilian peppertree is a sprawling shrub or small tree, with a shallow root system, reaching a height of 7‚Äì10 m. The branches can be upright, reclining, or nearly vine-like, all on the same plant. Its plastic morphology allows it to thrive in all kinds of ecosystems: from dunes to swamps, where it grows as a semi-aquatic plant.Paulo Backes & Bruno Irgang, Mata Atl√¢ntica: as √°rvores e a paisagem, Porto Alegre, Paisagem do Sul, 2004, page 102 The leaves are alternate, 10‚Äì22 cm long, pinnately compound with (3‚Äì) 5‚Äì15 leaflets; the leaflets are roughly oval (lanceolate to elliptical), 3‚Äì6 cm long and 2‚Äì3.5 cm broad, and have finely toothed margins, an acute to rounded apex and yellowish veins. The leaf rachis between the leaflets is usually (but not invariably) slightly winged. The plant is dioecious, with small white flowers borne profusely in axillary clusters. The fruit is a drupe 4‚Äì5 mm diameter, carried in dense clusters of hundreds. The two varieties are: *S. terebinthifolia var. acutifolia, leaves to 22 cm, with 7‚Äì15 leaflets, fruit pink *S. terebinthifolia var. terebinthifolia, leaves to 17 cm, with 5‚Äì13 leaflets, fruit red File:Schinus terebinthifolius leaves.jpgLeaves File:Schinus terebinthifolius flowers.jpgFlowers File:Schinus terebinthifolius stem.jpgStem File:Pink Peppercorns (Schinus terebinthifolius).JPGDried berries Cultivation and uses left Brazilian pepper is widely grown as an ornamental plant in frost-free regions of South America for its foliage and fruit. It is considered as a melliferous flower and is the main source of food for the bee Tetragonisca angustula, which is an important honey producer. Although it is not a true pepper (Piper), its dried drupes are often sold as pink peppercorns, as are the fruits from the related species Schinus molle (Peruvian peppertree). The seeds can be used as a spice, adding a pepper-like taste to food. They are usually sold in a dry state and have a bright pink color. They are less often sold pickled in brine, where they have a dull, almost green hue. In the United States, it has been introduced to California, Texas, Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada, Louisiana and Florida. Planted originally as an ornamental outside of its native range, Brazilian pepper has become widespread and is considered an invasive species in many subtropical regions with moderate to high rainfall, including parts or all of Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, southern China, Cuba, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Malta, the Marshall Islands, Mauritius, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norfolk Island, Puerto Rico, R√©union, South Africa and the United States. In drier areas, such as Israel and southern California, it is also grown, but has not generally proved invasive. In California, it is considered invasive in coastal regions by the California Invasive Plant Council.http://www.cal-ipc.org Brazilian pepper is hard to control because it produces basal shoots if the trunk is cut. Trees also produce abundant seeds that are dispersed by birds and ants. This same hardiness makes the tree highly useful for reforestation in its native environment, but enables it to become invasive outside of its natural range. Toxicity Like many other species in the family Anacardiaceae, Brazilian pepper has an aromatic sap that can cause skin reactions (similar to poison ivy burns) in some sensitive people ‚Äì although the reaction is usually weaker than that induced by touch of the closely related Lithraea molleoides, known in Brazil as \\"wild\\" aroeira (aroeira brava). Conversely, Schinus terebinthifolia is commonly known as \\"tame\\" aroeira (aroeira mansa). In a paper on triterpenes, the ingested fruits are noted to have a ‚Äúparalyzing effect‚Äù on birds.Campello, J.P. and A.J. Marsaioli. 1974. Triterpenes of Schinus terebinthifolius. Phytochemistry 13: 659-660 The narcotic and toxic effects on birds and other wildlife has also been noted by others, e.g., Bureau of Aquatic Plant Management. The AMA Handbook of Poisonous and Injurious Plants reports that the triterpenes found in the fruits can result in irritation of the throat, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and vomitingLampe, K.F. and M.A. McCann. 1985. AMA Handbook of Poisonous and Injurious Plants. American Medical Association, Chicago. Like most other members of the Anacardiaceae, Brazilian pepper contains active alkenyl phenols, e.g., urushiol, cardol, which can cause contact dermatitis and inflammation in sensitive individuals.Lampe, K.F. and R. Fagerstrom. 1968. Plant Toxicity and Dermatitis. Williams & Wilkins Co., BaltimoreTomlinson, P.B. 1980. The Biology of Trees Native to Tropical Florida. Harvard University Printing Office, Allston. Contact with the ‚Äúsap‚Äù from a cut or bruised tree can result in rash, lesions, oozing sores, severe itching, welts and reddening and swelling (especially of the eyes).Morton, J.F. 1978. Brazilian pepper - Its impact on people, animals and the environment. Econ. Bot.32: 353-359. The burning of plant matter releases many airborne irritants, so it is not an effective means of control. It is said to have a \\"mace-like\\" effect upon nearby people and is highly advised against. History Also known as \\"Florida holly\\", Schinus terebinthifolia was introduced to Florida by at latest 1891, probably earlier, where it has spread rapidly since about 1940,Ewel, J. J. 1986. Invasibility: Lessons from south Florida. in H. A. Mooney and J. A. Drake, eds. Ecology of biological invasions of North America and Hawaii, pp. 214‚Äì230. Springer-Verlag, New York. replacing native plants, like mangroves, with thousands of acres occupied. It is especially adept at colonizing disturbed sites and can grow in both wet and dry conditions. Its growth habit allows it to climb over understory trees and invade mature canopies, forming thickets that choke out most other plants. As an invasive pest The species, including the seed, is legally prohibited from sale, transport, or planting in Florida, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Noxious Weed List. It is classified as a Category I pest by The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (FL EPPC). To keep the plant from spreading into native plant communities and displacing them, local regulations and environmental guidelines require eradication of Brazilian pepper wherever possible. The plant and all parts are also illegal for sale or transfer in Texas. As one of the two species sold as pink peppercorn, the other being Schinus molle, it lacks generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status with the FDA. Several biocontrols are being studied for use in Florida. It is a declared weed in several states of Australia. In South Africa, it is classified as a category 1 invader in KwaZulu-Natal province, where any plants are to be removed and destroyed, and a category 3 invader in all other provinces, meaning it may no longer be planted. Control Two herbicides are approved for use in the United States to exterminate Brazilian pepper: Triclopyr, using the basal bark method; and glyphosate. Picloram can be used if the stump has been freshly cut, but this is neither the preferred nor most effective means of eradication. Medicinal uses Peppertree is the subject of extensive folk medicinal lore where it is indigenous. Virtually all parts of this tropical tree, including its leaves, bark, fruit, seeds, resin and oleoresin (or balsam) have been used medicinally by indigenous peoples throughout the tropics. The plant has a very long history of use and appears in ancient religious artifacts and on idols among some of the ancient Chilean Amerindians. Throughout South and Central America, Brazilian peppertree is reported to be an astringent, antibacterial, diuretic, digestive stimulant, tonic, antiviral and wound healer. In Peru, the sap is used as a mild laxative and a diuretic and the entire plant is used externally for fractures and as a topical antiseptic. The oleoresin is used externally as a wound healer, to stop bleeding and for toothaches and it is taken internally for rheumatism and as a purgative. In South Africa, a leaf tea is used to treat colds and a leaf decoction is inhaled for colds, hypertension, depression and irregular heartbeat. In the Brazilian Amazon, a bark tea is used as a laxative and a bark-and-leaf tea is used as a stimulant and antidepressant. In Argentina, a decoction is made with the dried leaves and is taken for menstrual disorders and is also used for respiratory and urinary tract infections and disorders. Brazilian peppertree is still employed in herbal medicine today in many countries. It is used for many conditions in the tropics, including menstrual disorders, bronchitis, gingivitis, gonorrhea, gout, eye infections, rheumatism, sores, swellings, tuberculosis, ulcers, urethritis, urogenital disorders, venereal diseases, warts and wounds. In Brazilian herbal medicine today, the dried bark and/or leaves are employed for heart problems (hypertension and irregular heart beat), infections of all sorts, menstrual disorders with excessive bleeding, tumors and general inflammation. A liquid extract or tincture prepared with the bark is used internally as a stimulant, tonic and astringent and externally for rheumatism, gout and syphilis. Recently, the fruit of the plant has been studied and shows promise as a treatment for MRSA. A chemical in the berry appears to stop bacteria from producing a toxin which breaks down tissue. It also appears to suppress the way the bacteria communicate. pdf References  External links * Species Profile ‚Äì Brazilian Peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolius), National Invasive Species Information Center, United States National Agricultural Library.

Since June 1, 2006, it has been operated by Jefferson Science Associates, LLC, a limited liability company created by Southeastern Universities Research Association and PAE Applied Technologies. Until 1996 it was known as the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF); commonly, this name is still used for the main accelerator. Founded in 1984, Jefferson Lab employs more than 750 people, and more than 2,000 scientists from around the world have conducted research using the facility. History https://www.jlab.org/visitors/history/index.html The facility was established in 1984 (first initial funding by DOE, Department of Energy) as the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF); the name was changed to Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in 1996. The full funding for construction was appropriated by US Congress in 1986 and on February 13, 1987, the construction of the main component, the CEBAF accelerator begun. First beam was delivered to experimental area on 1 July 1994. The design energy of 4 GeV for the beam was achieved during the year 1995. The laboratory dedication took place 24 May 1996 (at this event the name was also changed). Full initial operations with all three initial experiment areas online at the design energy was achieved on June 19, 1998. On August 6, 2000 the CEBAF reached \\"enhanced design energy\\" of 6 GeV. In 2001, plans for an energy upgrade to 12 GeV electron beam and plans to construct a fourth experimental hall area started. The plans progressed through various DOE Critical Decision-stages in the 2000s decade, with the final DOE acceptance in 2008 and the construction on the 12 GeV upgrade beginning in 2009. May 18, 2012 the original 6 GeV CEBAF accelerator shut down for the replacement of the accelerator components for the 12 GeV upgrade. 178 experiments were completed with the original CEBAF. In addition to the accelerator, the laboratory has housed and continues to house a free electron laser (FEL) instrument. The construction of the FEL started 11 June 1996. It achieved first light on June 17, 1998. Since then, the FEL has been upgraded numerous times, increasing its power and capabilities substantially. Jefferson Lab was also involved in the construction of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in Oak Ridge. Jefferson built the SNS superconducting accelerator and helium refrigeration system. The accelerator components were designed and produced 2000‚Äì2005. Accelerator The laboratory's main research facility is the CEBAF accelerator, which consists of a polarized electron source and injector and a pair of superconducting RF linear accelerators that are 7/8-mile (1400 m) in length and connected to each other by two arc sections that contain steering magnets. As the electron beam makes up to five successive orbits, its energy is increased up to a maximum of 6 GeV (the original CEBAF machine worked first in 1995 at the design energy of 4 GeV before reaching \\"enhanced design energy\\" of 6 GeV in 2000; since then the facility has been upgraded into 12 GeV energy). This leads to a design that appears similar to a racetrack when compared to the classical ring-shaped accelerators found at sites such as CERN or Fermilab. Effectively, CEBAF is a linear accelerator, similar to SLAC at Stanford, that has been folded up to a tenth of its normal length. The design of CEBAF allows the electron beam to be continuous rather than the pulsed beam typical of ring shaped accelerators. (There is some beam structure, but the pulses are very much shorter and closer together.) The electron beam is directed onto three potential targets (see below). One of the distinguishing features of Jefferson Lab is the continuous nature of the electron beam, with a bunch length of less than 1 picosecond. Another is Jefferson Lab's use of superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) technology, which uses liquid helium to cool niobium to approximately 4 K (‚àí452.5 ¬∞F), removing electrical resistance and allowing the most efficient transfer of energy to an electron. To achieve this, Jefferson Lab houses the world's largest liquid helium refrigerator, and it was one of the first large- scale implementations of SRF technology. The accelerator is built 8 meters below the Earth's surface, or approximately 25 feet, and the walls of the accelerator tunnels are 2 feet thick. The beam ends in four experimental halls, labelled Hall A, Hall B, Hall C, and Hall D. Each hall contains specialized spectrometers to record the products of collisions between the electron beam or with real photons and a stationary target. This allows physicists to study the structure of the atomic nucleus, specifically the interaction of the quarks that make up protons and neutrons of the nucleus. With each revolution around the accelerator, the beam passes through each of the two LINAC accelerators, but through a different set of bending magnets in semi-circular arcs at the ends of the linacs. The electrons make up to five passes through the linear accelerators. When a nucleus in the target is hit by an electron from the beam, an \\"interaction\\", or \\"event\\", occurs, scattering particles into the hall. Each hall contains an array of particle detectors that track the physical properties of the particles produced by the event. The detectors generate electrical pulses that are converted into digital values by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), time to digital converters (TDCs) and pulse counters (scalers). This digital data is gathered and stored so that the physicist can later analyze the data and reconstruct the physics that occurred. The system of electronics and computers that perform this task is called a data acquisition system. =12 GeV upgrade= , construction began on a $338 million upgrade to add an end station, Hall D, on the opposite end of the accelerator from the other three halls, as well as to double beam energy to 12 GeV. Concurrently, an addition to the Test Lab, (where the SRF cavities used in CEBAF and other accelerators used worldwide are manufactured) was constructed. , the upgrade achieved a new record for beam energy, at 10.5 GeV, delivering beam to Hall D. , the CEBAF accelerator delivered full-energy electrons as part of commissioning activities for the ongoing 12 GeV Upgrade project. Operators of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility delivered the first batch of 12 GeV electrons (12.065 Giga electron Volts) to its newest experimental hall complex, Hall D.https://www.jlab.org In September 2017, the official notification from the DOE of the formal approval of the 12 GeV upgrade project completion and start of operations was issued. By spring 2018, all fours research areas were successfully receiving beam and performing experiments. On 2 May 2018 the CEBAF 12 GeV Upgrade Dedication Ceremony took place.https://www.jlab.org/ir/archives/ , the CEBAF accelerator delivered electron beams to all four experimental halls simultaneously for physics- quality production running. Physics program Jefferson Lab conducts a broad program of research using the electromagnetic interaction to probe the structure of the nucleon (protons and neutrons), the production and decay of light mesons, and aspects of the interactions of nucleons in the atomic nucleus. The main tools are the scattering of electrons and the creation and utilization of high energy real photons. In addition, both electron and photon beams can be made highly polarized, allowing exploration of so-called spin degrees of freedom in investigations. The four experimental halls have distinct but overlapping research goals, but with instrumentation unique to each. = Hall A = Matching high resolution spectrometers (HRS) have been used to study deep-inelastic electron scattering. Using very well controlled polarized electron beams, parity violation in electron scattering has been studied. = Hall B = The CLAS detector was the mainstay of the Hall B experimental program from 1998 to 2012. Physics Working Groups in the areas of Deep-Inelastic Interactions, Hadron Spectroscopy, and Nuclear Interactions exist. See the article related to the spectrometer itself and physics program at the link CLAS. Polarized real photons and electron beams were used. Physics targets included liquid hydrogen and deuterium, as well as massive nuclear materials. In the era of 12 GeV beams at Jefferson Lab, the Hall B program has been restructured to include a new detector called CLAS12, as well as several other experiments using more specialized hardware. = Hall C = Multiple spectrometers and specialized equipment has been used to study, for example, parity-violating electron scattering to measure the weak charge of the proton and hypernuclear production with the electromagnetic interaction. = Hall D = This experimental hall was built for the beginning of the 12 GeV beam- energy program starting in 2014. This hall houses the GlueX experiment, which is designed to map out the light unflavored meson spectrum in detail in the search for explicit gluonic excitations in mesons. Free electron laser JLab houses the world's most powerful tunable free electron laser, with an output of over 14 kilowatts. CODA Since CEBAF has three complementary experiments running simultaneously, it was decided that the three data acquisition systems should be as similar as possible, so that physicists moving from one experiment to another would find a familiar environment. To that end, a group of specialist physicists was hired to form a data acquisition development group to develop a common system for all three halls. CODA, the CEBAF Online Data Acquisition system, was the result.coda.jlab.org CODA is a set of software tools and recommended hardware that facilitates a data acquisition system for nuclear physics experiments. In nuclear and particle physics experiments, the particle tracks are digitized by the data acquisition system, but the detectors are capable of generating a large number of possible measurements, or \\"data channels\\". Typically, the ADC, TDC, and other digital electronics are large circuit boards with connectors at the front edge that provide input and output for digital signals, and a connector at the back that plugs into a backplane. A group of boards is plugged into a chassis, or \\"crate\\", that provides physical support, power, and cooling for the boards and backplane. This arrangement allows electronics capable of digitizing many hundreds of channels to be compressed into a single chassis. In the CODA system, each chassis contains a board that is an intelligent controller for the rest of the chassis. This board, called a ReadOut Controller (ROC), configures each of the digitizing boards upon first receiving data, reads the data from the digitizers, and formats the data for later analysis.

They are herbivorous, smaller relatives of rabbits and hares. Description American pikas, known in the 19th century as \\"little Chief hares\\",Mearns, B & R. John Kirk Townsend: Collector of Audubon‚Äôs Western Birds and Mammals. Page 108. Retrieved from on 2009-10-06. have a small, round, ovate body. Their body lengths range from . Their hind feet range from 25 to 35 mm (1‚Äì1¬Ω in). They usually weigh about . Body size can vary among populations. In populations with sexual dimorphism, males are slightly larger than females. The American pika is intermediate in size among pikas. The hind legs of the pika do not seem to be much longer than its front legs and its hind feet are relatively short when compared to most other lagomorphs. It has densely furred soles on its feet except for black pads at the ends of the toes. The ears are moderately large and suborbicular, and are hairy on both surfaces, normally dark with white margins. The pika's \\"buried\\" tail is longer relative to body size compared to other lagomorphs. It has a slightly rounded skull with a broad and flat preorbital region. The fur color of the pika is the same for both sexes, but varies by subspecies and season. The dorsal fur of the pika ranges from grayish to cinnamon-brown, often colored with tawny or ochraceous hues, during the summer. During winter, the fur becomes grayer and longer. The dense underfur is usually slate gray- or lead-colored. It also has whitish ventral fur. Males are called bucks and females are called does like rabbits. This individual was at above sea level in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Distribution and habitat The American pika can be found throughout the mountains of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and New Mexico. Of the 30 existing species of pika, it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika (O. collaris). In relation to the distribution of the American pika, the collared pika is located farther north of those regions and is separated by a gap of about extending across British Columbia and Alberta.MacDonald, Stephen O. and Jones, Clyde. 1987. ‚ÄúMammalian Species: Ochotona collaris.‚Äù https://www.jstor.org/stable/3503971 Pikas inhabit talus fields that are fringed by suitable vegetation on alpine areas. They also live in piles of broken rock.Hafner, D.J. (1993) \\"North American pika (Ochotona princeps) as a late Quaternary biogeographic indicator species\\". Quaternary Research, 39:373‚Äì380. Sometimes, they live in man-made substrate such as mine tailings and piles of scrap lumber. Pikas usually have their den and nest sites below rock around 0.2‚Äì1 m in diameter, but often sit on larger and more prominent rocks. They generally reside in scree near or above the tree line. Pikas are restricted to cool, moist microhabitats on high peaks or watercourses. Intolerant of high diurnal temperatures, in the northern portion of their range, they may be found near sea level, but in the south they are rare below . Pikas rely on existing spaces in the talus for homes and do not dig burrows. However, they can enlarge their homes by digging. Diet The American pika is a generalist herbivore. It eats a large variety of green plants, including different kinds of grasses, sedges, thistles, and fireweed. Although a pika can meet its water demand from the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.Martin, J. W. 1982. Southern pika (Ochotona princeps) biology and ecology: a literature review. Pikas have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying). They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer. Since they do not hibernate, pikas have greater energy demands than other montane mammals. They also make 13 trips per hour to collect vegetation when haying, up to a little over 100 trips per day. The timing of haying seems to correlate to the amount of precipitation from the previous winter. Pikas start and then quit haying earlier in years following little snow and early spring. In areas at lower elevations, haying begins before the snow has melted at high altitudes; at higher elevations, haying continues after it ends in lower elevations. When haying, pikas harvest plants in a deliberate sequence, corresponding to their seasonal phenology. They seem to assess the nutritional value of available food and harvest accordingly. Pikas select plants that have the higher caloric, protein, lipid, and water content. Forbs and tall grass tend to be hayed more than eaten directly. Haypiles tend to be stored under the talus near the talus-meadow interface, although they may be constructed on the talus surface. Males generally store more vegetation than females and adults usually store more than juveniles. Pikas deposit two kinds of fecal droppings: Hard, brown, round pellets and pellets that are soft black shiny strings that form in the caecum. Caecal pellets have more energy value than stored plant food and the pika may consume them directly or store them for later. Life history cryptic coloration helps it blend in with its environment in the Sierra Nevada. The American pika is diurnal. The total area of land that an American pika uses is known as a home range. About 55% of its home range is territory that the pika defends against intruders. Territory size can vary from 410‚Äì709 m¬≤ and is dependent on configuration, distance to vegetation, and quality of vegetation. The home ranges of pikas may overlap, with the distances of the home ranges of a mating pair being shorter than that of the nearest neighbors of the same sex. Spatial distances between adults of a pair is greatest during early and midsummer and reduces during late summer and early autumn. Pikas defend their territories with aggression. Actual aggressive encounters are rare and usually occur between members of the same sex and those unfamiliar with each other. A pika may intrude on another‚Äôs territory, but usually when the resident is not active. During haying, territorial behavior increases. Adult pikas of the opposite sex with territories adjacent form mated pairs. When more than one male is available, females exhibit mate choice. Pikas are reflex ovulators; ovulation only occurs after copulation, and they are also seasonally polyestrous. A female has two litters per year and these litters average three young each. Breeding takes place one month before the snow melts and gestation lasts around 30 days. Parturition occurs as early as March in lower elevations, but occurs from April to June at higher elevations. Lactation significantly reduces a female's fat reserves and they only nurse the second litter if the first does not survive, despite exhibiting postpartum estrus. Pikas are born slightly altricial, being blind, slightly haired, and having fully erupted teeth. They weigh between 10 and 12 g at birth. At around nine days old, they are able to open their eyes. Mothers forage most of the day and return to the nest once every two hours to nurse the young. Young become independent after four weeks, around the same time they are weaned. Young may remain in their natal or an adjoining home range. When in their home range, young occupy areas away from their relatives as much as possible. Dispersal appears to be caused by competition for territories.MM Peacock. 1997. \\"Determining natal dispersal patterns in a population of North American pikas (Ochotona princeps) using direct mark-resight and indirect genetic methods\\". Behavioral Ecology 8:340‚Äì350 Pikas are vocal, using both calls and songs to communicate among themselves. A call is used to warn when a predator is lurking nearby, and a song is used during the breeding season (males only), and during autumn (both males and females). Predators of the pika include eagles, hawks, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, and weasels. Taxonomy The American pika was described in the scientific literature by John Richardson in Fauna Boreali-Americana in 1828. The original scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps. Lepus (Lagomys) princeps print from original scientific text Conservation and decline As they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems for detecting global warming in the western United States. Temperature increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. American pikas, however, cannot easily migrate in response to climate change, as their habitat is currently restricted to small, disconnected habitat \\"islands\\" in numerous mountain ranges.http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/finder/americanpika/americanpika.html Pikas can die in six hours when exposed to temperatures above if individuals cannot find refuge from heat. In warmer environments, such as during midday sun and at lower elevation limits, pikas typically become inactive and withdraw into cooler talus openings. Because of behavioral adaptation, American pikas also persist in the hot climates of Craters of the Moon and Lava Beds National Monuments (Idaho and California, respectively). Average and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are , respectively.Dept. of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, 12-month Finding on a Petition to List the American Pika as Threatened or Endangered Recent studies suggest some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming. A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled populations of American pika had disappeared in the Great Basin, leading biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as a whole is vulnerable. In 2010, the US government considered, then decided not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act; in the IUCN Red List, it is still considered a species of least concern. The Pikas in Peril Project,http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/ucbn/monitor/pikas_in_peril.cfm funded through the National Park Service Climate Change Response Program, began data collection in May 2010. A large team of academic researchers and National Park Service staff - from three universities and eight national parks - worked together to address questions regarding the vulnerability of the American pika to future climate change scenarios projected for the western United States. The project concluded in 2016.https://www.researchgate.net/project/Pikas-in-Peril References External links * View the Pika genome in Ensembl.

He was best known for his highly detailed paintings of hamburger stands, pick-up trucks, and California banks, portrayed in a deliberately objective manner.  Biography  = Early life = Goings was born to a working-class family in Corning, California and grew up during the Great Depression. He was exposed to art and painting in a freshman high-school art class, and inspired by his discovery of Rembrandt at his local library. His aunt encouraged him to draw, and bought him books and instructional materials. He began painting using paint from the local hardware store, and old bed sheets when canvas was unavailable. = Education = After he served in the military, he enrolled in Hartnell College, in Salinas, California and was approached and encouraged to attend art school by Leon Amyx, who was the head of the art department at Hartnell at that time and a well-known painter. Goings studied art at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. During his studies at California College of the Arts, he studied along other painters from the Photorealist Movement including Robert Bechtle and Richard Mclean as well as other artists including Nathan Oliveira He received his MFA in painting from Sacramento State College in 1965. He was inspired by artists such as Wayne Thiebaud, Johannes Vermeer, Thomas Eakins. His interest in Photorealism sparked after being thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the pop art imagery at the time, he felt that if something was to represent an object then why not make it resemble a photograph as closely as possible. = Work = Goings helped to define the Photorealist Movement along with Robert Bechtle, Robert Cottingham, Audrey Flack, Don Eddy, and Richard Estes. \\"In 1963 I wanted to start painting again but I decided I wasn't going to do abstract pictures\\". It occurred to me that I should go as far to the opposite as I could. ... It occurred to me that projecting and tracing the photograph instead of copying it freehand would be even more shocking. To copy a photograph literally was considered a bad thing to do. It went against all of my art school training... some people were upset by what I was doing and said 'it's not art, it can't possibly be art'. That gave me encouragement in a perverse way, because I was delighted to be doing something that was really upsetting people... I was having a hell of a lot of fun...\\" (edited quote from Realists at Work) Realists at Work by John Arthur.

It replaced the former Six Flags Wild Safari drive-through safari park, which closed on September 30, 2012 in order for it to become its own standalone ride experience. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the attraction has returned to being a drive- through experience for private vehicles, with tickets that can be bought separately from the main park. History An African bush elephant on safari in May 2014. Wild Safari was opened to the public on July 4, 1974, along with its theme park neighbor, Great Adventure. On August 20, 2012, Six Flags announced that the park would be closed to private vehicles from September 30, 2012, and that the animals would remain in the preserve. On August 30, 2012, Six Flags announced that they would open the Safari Off Road Adventure in 2013. Following Wild Safari's closure on September 30, 2012, construction began to renovate it to become the Safari Off Road Adventure. Safari Off Road Adventure opened May 25, 2013. In March 2020, Six Flags suspended all operations across all their properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the continuation of the pandemic in May, Six Flags Great Adventure announced that they plan on reopening the first Six Flags attraction, Safari Off Road Adventure, while keeping the rest of the park closed. This comes after the Governor of New Jersey signed an executive order to allow drive-thru venues to resume operations on May 13. Safari Off Road Adventure reopened on May 30, with the attraction going back to its historic routes and becoming once again a drive-through safari. A month later, Six Flags Great Adventure announced their new opening date for the season on July 3, 2020. Plans were in place for Safari Off Road Adventure to return with the theme park operations, but park officials stated that the safari will continue its own operations, due to the popularity and the ability for guest to continue social distancing while in their own vehicles. Overview The former Wild Safari park covered with the main road being long. It contained 11 themed sections, and was a home to 1200 animals from six different continents. When the safari attraction was joined with Great Adventure to form one park in 2013, it made Six Flags Great Adventure the second-largest theme park in the world at , after Disney's Animal Kingdom. The park also added an up-charge zip line attraction. Since its renovation, Safari Off Road Adventure retains the themed areas from Wild Safari. Additionally, midway through the tour passengers are able to disembark from the vehicles at an area called Camp Aventura. This section of the park contains much of Great Adventure's bird and reptile collection, while also offering guests an opportunity to feed giraffes.

A large altarpiece on panel. The outer wings are hinged, and painted on both sides. A panel painting is a painting made on a flat panel made of wood, either a single piece, or a number of pieces joined together. Until canvas became the more popular support medium in the 16th century, it was the normal form of support for a painting not on a wall (fresco) or vellum, which was used for miniatures in illuminated manuscripts and paintings for the framing. History Greco-Roman Boy, 2nd century CE (a Fayum mummy portrait). Encaustic on wood‚Äînote the cracks. Panel painting is very old; it was a very prestigious medium in Greece and Rome, but only very few examples of ancient panel paintings have survived. A series of 6th century BC painted tablets from Pitsa (Greece) represent the oldest surviving Greek panel paintings. Most classical Greek paintings that were famous in their day seem to have been of a size comparable to smaller modern works ‚Äì perhaps up to a half-length portrait size. However, for a generation in the second quarter of the fifth-century BC there was a movement, called the \\"new painting\\" and led by Polygnotus, for very large painted friezes, apparently painted on wood, decorating the interiors of public buildings with very large and complicated subjects containing numerous figures at least half life-size, and including battle scenes. We can only attempt to imagine what these looked like from some detailed literary descriptions and vase-paintings that appear to echo their compositions.Boardman, 103-104 (illus. 105) The first century BC to third century AD Fayum mummy portraits, preserved in the exceptionally dry conditions of Egypt, provide the bulk of surviving panel painting from the Imperial Roman period ‚Äì about 900 face or bust portraits survive. The Severan Tondo, also from Egypt (about 200AD) is one of the handful of non-funerary Graeco-Roman specimens to survive. Wood has always been the normal support for the Icons of Byzantine art and the later Orthodox traditions, the earliest of which (all in Saint Catherine's Monastery) date from the 5th or 6th centuries, and are the oldest panel paintings which seem to be of the highest contemporary quality. Encaustic and tempera are the two techniques used in antiquity. Encaustic largely ceased to be used after the early Byzantine icons. Although there seem from literary references to have been some panel paintings produced in Western Europe through the centuries between Late Antiquity and the Romanesque period, and Byzantine icons were imported, there are next to no survivals in an unaltered state. In the 12th century panel painting experienced a revival because of new liturgical practices‚Äîthe priest and congregation were now on the same side of the altar, leaving the space behind the altar free for the display of a holy image‚Äîand thus altar decorations were in demand. The earliest forms of panel painting were dossals (altar backs), altar fronts and crucifixes. All were painted with religious images, commonly the Christ or the Virgin, with the saints appropriate to the dedication of the church, and the local town or diocese, or to the donor. Donor portraits including members of the donor's family are also often shown, usually kneeling to the side. They were for some time a cheaper alternative to the far more prestigious equivalents in metalwork, decorated with gems, enamels, and perhaps ivory figures, most of which have long been broken up for their valuable materials. Painted panels for altars are most numerous in Spain, especially Catalonia, which is explained by the poverty of the country at this time, as well as the lack of Reformation iconoclasm.Dodwell, 263 The 13th and 14th centuries in Italy were a great period of panel painting, mostly altarpieces or other religious works. However, it is estimated that of all the panel paintings produced there, 99.9 percent have been lost. The vast majority of Early Netherlandish paintings are on panel, and these include most of the earliest portraits, such as those by Jan van Eyck, and some other secular scenes. However, one of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French Madonna with angels of about 1410 in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin, which is very early indeed for oil painting also. In these works the frame and panel are sometimes a single piece of wood, as with Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?) by van Eyck (National Gallery, London), where the frame was also painted, including an inscription done illusionistically to resemble carving.Campbell, 216 The Frankfurt Paradiesg√§rtlein, a German panel painting from circa 1410 By the 15th century with the increased wealth of Europe, and later the appearance of humanism, and a changing attitude about the function of art and patronage, panel painting went in new directions. Secular art opened the way to the creation of chests, painted beds, birth trays and other furniture. Many such works are now detached and hung framed on walls in museums. Many double-sided wings of altarpieces (see picture at top) have also been sawn into two one- sided panels. Canvas took over from panel in Italy by the first half of the 16th century, a change led by Mantegna and the artists of Venice (which made the finest canvas at this point, for sails). In the Netherlands the change took about a century longer, and panel paintings remained common, especially in Northern Europe, even after the cheaper and more portable canvas had become the main support medium. The young Rubens and many other painters preferred it for the greater precision that could be achieved with a totally solid support, and many of his most important works also used it, even for paintings over four metres long in one dimension. His panels are of notoriously complicated construction, containing as many as seventeen pieces of wood (Het Steen, National Gallery, London). For smaller cabinet paintings, copper sheets (often old printmaking plates) were another rival support, from the end of the 16th century, used by many artists including Adam Elsheimer. Many Dutch painters of the Golden Age used panel for their small works, including Rembrandt on occasion. By the 18th century it had become unusual to paint on panel, except for small works to be inset into furniture, and the like. But, for example, The National Gallery in London has two Goya portraits on panel. Many other painting traditions also painted, and still paint, on wood, but the term is usually only used to refer to the Western tradition described above. Panel construction and preparation Russian icon by Andrey Rublev, early 15th century, on a three piece panel. The raised edges are probably gesso rather than wood The technique is known to us through Cennino Cennini's The Craftsman's Handbook (Il libro dell' arte) published in 1390, and other sources. It changed little over the centuries. It was a laborious and painstaking process: *A carpenter would construct a solid wood piece the size of the panel needed. Usually a radial cut piece was preferred (across rather than along the length of the tree; the opposite of most timber cuts), with the outer sapwood excluded. In Italy it was usually seasoned poplar, willow or linden. It would be planed and sanded and if needed, joined with other pieces to obtain the desired size and shape. *The wood would be coated with a mixture of animal-skin glues and resin and covered with linen (the mixture and linen combination was known as a \\"size\\"); this might be done by a specialist, or in the artists studio. *Once the size had dried, layer upon layer of gesso would be applied, each layer sanded down before the next applied, sometimes as many as 15 layers, before a smooth hard surface emerged, not unlike ivory. This stage was not necessarily done after the 16th century, or darker grounds were used. Painting techniques Once the panel construction was complete, the design was laid out, usually in charcoal. The usual ancient painting technique was encaustic, used at Al-Fayum and in the earliest surviving Byzantine icons, which are at the Saint Catherine's Monastery. This uses heated wax as the medium for the pigments. This was replaced before the end of first millennium by tempera, which uses an egg-yolk medium. Using small brushes dipped in a mixture of pigment and egg-yolk, the paint was applied in very small, almost transparent, brushstrokes. Thin layers of paint would be used to create volumetric forms. By the beginning of the 15th century, oil painting was developed. This was more tolerant, and allowed the exceptional detail of Early Netherlandish art. This used a very painstaking multi-layered technique, where the painting, or a particular part of it, had to be left for a couple of days for one layer to dry before the next was applied. Conservation and scientific analysis Landscape with rainbow 94 x 123 cm, 1636‚Äì8. A large Rubens panel painting, with a panel made out of many pieces Wood panels, especially if kept with too little humidity, often warp and crack with age, and from the 19th century, when reliable techniques were developed, many have been transferred to canvas or modern board supports. Wood panel is now rather more useful to art historians than canvas, and in recent decades there has been great progress in extracting this information. Many fakes have been discovered and mistaken datings corrected. Specialists can identify the tree species used, which varied according to the area where the painting was made. Carbon-dating techniques can give an approximate date-range (typically to about a range of about 20 years), and dendrochronology sequences have been developed for the main source areas of timber for panels. Italian paintings used local or sometimes Dalmatian wood, most often poplar, but including chestnut, walnut, oak and other woods. The Netherlands ran short of local timber early in the 15th century, and most Early Netherlandish masterpieces are Baltic oak, often Polish, cut north of Warsaw and shipped down the Vistula, across the Baltic to the Netherlands.Campbell, 29 Southern German painters often used pine, and mahogany imported into Europe was used by later painters, including examples by Rembrandt and Goya. In theory, dendro- chronology gives an exact felling date, but in practice allowances have to be made for a seasoning period of several years, and a small panel may be from the centre of the tree, with no way of knowing how many rings outside the panel there were. So dendro-chronological conclusions tend to be expressed as a \\"terminus post quem\\" or an earliest possible date, with a tentative estimate of an actual date, that may be twenty or more years later. The so-called Panel Paintings Initiative is a multi-year project in collaboration between the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Foundation, and the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Panel Paintings Initiative is a response to the growing recognition that significant collections of paintings on wood panels may be at risk in coming decades due to the waning numbers of conservators and craftspeople with the highly specialized skills required for the conservation of these complex works of art.More information on the objectives of the project can be found on The Getty website Types of wood Artists would typically use wood native to the region. Albrecht D√ºrer (1471‚Äì1528), for example, painted on poplar when he was in Venice and on oak when in the Netherlands and southern Germany. Leonardo da Vinci (1452‚Äì1519) used oak for his paintings in France; Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5‚Äì1545) and Hans Holbein (1497/8‚Äì1543) used oak while working in southern Germany and England. In the Middle Ages, spruce and lime were used in the Upper Rhine and often in Bavaria. Outside of the Rhineland, softwood (such as pinewood) was mainly used. Of a group of twenty Norwegian altar frontals from the Gothic period (1250‚Äì1350) fourteen were made of fir, two of oak, and four of pine (Kaland 1982). Large altars made in Denmark during the fifteenth century used oak for the figures as well as for the painted wings. Lime was popular with Albrecht Altdorfer (ca. 1480‚Äì1538), Baldung Grien, Christoph Amberger (d. 1562), D√ºrer, and Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472‚Äì1553). Cranach often used beech wood‚Äîan unusual choice. In Northern Europe, poplar is very rarely found, but walnut and chestnut are not uncommon. In the northeast and south, coniferous trees such as spruce, and various types of fir, and pine have been used. Fir wood is shown to have been used in the Upper and Middle Rhine, Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Saxony. Pinewood was used mainly in Tirol and beech wood only in Saxony. However, in general, oak was the most common substrate used for panel making in the Low Countries, northern Germany, and the Rhineland around Cologne. In France, until the seventeenth century, most panels were made from oak, although a few made of walnut and poplar have been found. The oak favored as a support by the painters of the northern school was, however, not always of local origin. In the seventeenth century about four thousand full-grown oak trees were needed to build a medium-sized merchant ship; thus, imported wood was necessary. Oak coming from K√∂nigsberg as well as Gda≈Ñsk is often found among works by Flemish and Dutch artists from the 15th through the 17th centuries; the origin can be established by the patterns of growth rings. In the last decade of the seventeenth century, Wilhelmus Beurs, a Dutch writer on painting techniques, considered oak to be the most useful wooden substrate on which to paint. However, exceptions are seen rather early in the seventeenth century: sometimes walnut, pearwood, cedarwood, or Indian woods were used. Mahogany was already in use by a number of painters during the first decades of the seventeenth century and was used often in the Netherlands in the nineteenth century. Even so, when canvas or copper was not used, the main oeuvre of the northern school was painted on oak panels.Wadum pp.149-177 See also *Cradling (art restoration) *Gothic art *Medieval art Notes References *Boardman, John ed., The Oxford History of Classical Art, 1993, OUP, *Campbell, Lorne.

As such, these reform policies are in the tradition of laissez faire, emphasizing the distortions caused by government, rather than in ordoliberalism, which emphasizes the need for state regulation to maximize efficiency. Microeconomic reform in Australia Microeconomic reform dominated Australian economic policy from the early 1980s until the end of the 20th century. The beginning of microeconomic reform is commonly dated to the floating of the Australian dollar in 1983. The last major policy initiatives associated with the microeconomic reform agenda was the package of tax reforms centered on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) which came into force in July 2000, and the privatization of Telstra which began in 1998 and was completed in 2006. There were, however, some instances of microeconomic reform before the 1980s, notably including the Whitlam government‚Äôs 25 percent tariff cut. Similarly, the consequences of some microeconomic reforms initiated in the 1990s, such as National Competition Policy are still being worked through. The policy agenda associated with microeconomic reform included: * reductions in and eventual removal of tariff protection * corporatisation and privatisation of government business enterprises. * deregulation of industries including airlines * new forms of regulation in industries subject to privatisation and corporatisation * tax reform Microeconomic reform in the People's Republic of China The Chinese economic reform () refers to the program of economic changes called \\"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\\" in the People's Republic of China (PRC) that were started in 1978 by pragmatists within the Communist Party of China (CPC) led by Deng Xiaoping and are ongoing as of the early 21st century. The goal of Chinese economic reform was to generate sufficient surplus value to finance the modernization of the mainland Chinese economy. Neither the socialist command economy, favored by CPC conservatives, nor the Maoist attempt at a Great Leap Forward from socialism to communism in China's agriculture (with the commune system) had generated sufficient surplus value for these purposes. The initial challenge of economic reform was to solve the problems of motivating workers and farmers to produce a larger surplus and to eliminate economic imbalances that were common in command economies. Economic reforms started since 1978 have helped lift millions of people out of poverty, bringing the poverty rate down from 53% of the population in 1981 to 8% by 2001.Fighting Poverty: Findings and Lessons from China‚Äôs Success (World Bank). Retrieved August 10, 2006..... Microeconomic reform in India The economic liberalization of 1991, initiated by then Indian prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and his finance minister Manmohan Singh, did away with investment, industrial and import licensing and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors. Since then, the overall direction of liberalization has remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has yet tried to take on powerful lobbies such as the trade unions and farmers, or contentious issues such as reforming labor laws and reducing agricultural subsidies. The effect of these reforms has been positive, and since 1990, India has had high growth rates and has emerged as one of the wealthiest economies in the developing world. During this period, the economy has grown constantly with only a few major setbacks. This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates, and food security since then. Economic Reform in Iran Economic reform in New Zealand After the snap election of 1984 in New Zealand, the new Finance Minister, Roger Douglas, began a speedy reform of the New Zealand economy. The speed of the reforms can be partially attributed to the currency crisis that resulted from the former government's refusal to devalue the New Zealand dollar. The policies included cutting subsidies and trade barriers, privatising public assets and the control of inflation through measures rooted in monetarism. These policies were regarded in some quarters of Douglas's New Zealand Labour Party as a betrayal of traditional Labour ideals. The Labour Party subsequently retreated from these policies, but it became the core doctrine of the New Zealand ACT party. The reforms created a very business-friendly regulatory framework. A 2008 study ranked New Zealand 99.9% in \\"Business freedom\\", and 80% overall in \\"Economic freedom\\", noting amongst other things that it only takes 12 days to establish a business in New Zealand on average, compared with a worldwide average of 43 days. Other indicators measured were property rights, labor market conditions, government controls and corruption, the last being considered \\"next to non-existent\\" in the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal study. Economic reform in the USSR and Russia Economic reforms began in the Soviet Union when Perestroika was introduced in June 1985 by the then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Its literal meaning is \\"restructuring\\", referring to the restructuring of the Soviet economy. During the initial period (1985‚Äì1987) of Mikhail Gorbachev's time in power, he talked about modifying central planning, but did not make any truly fundamental changes (uskoreniye, acceleration). Gorbachev and his team of economic advisers then introduced more fundamental reforms, which became known as perestroika (economic restructuring). Economic reform in Africa Economic reform began in Africa throughout Africa in the mid-1990s. Before that, the two decades of donor-sponsored reform efforts to Africa failed to help most sub-Saharan economies to overcome the fiscal and balance of payments deficits. During the mid-1990s, several civil wars ended and a wave of democratization started. The growth rate reached 1.2 percent a year between 1994 and 1997 which is the highest rate during that generation. However, the growth is a result of a donor-led process of structural adjustment as compatible with the survival of the status quo. The growth rate started to decline after 1998 and civil wars reactivated again by then. The two-decade failure reform leaves many African countries incapable of leading another economic reform.Van de Walle, Nicolas. 2004. ‚ÄúEconomic Reform: Patterns and Constraints‚Äù.  Economic reform in North Korea  North Korea is a communist country with the central economic planning system. With the ongoing nuclear issue, North Korea is politically and economically isolated from other countries. Therefore, several tries for economic reforms did not appear to be successful. Its economy relied heavily on the defense industry and the consumer goods industry had been overlooked according to the juche policy. Under the Third Seven-Year Economic Plan (1987‚Äì93), DPRK aimed to focus on technology-based industry and to solve their scarcity of electricity. Nevertheless, it did not give a satisfiable result. One of the causes was its relationship with trading partners and losing supportive allies. In response, North Korea tried to attract foreign investors by endorsing joint venture and opening some free-trade zones. Unluckily, with other factors, this policy was not practical. In addition, it also had to encounter a massive military expenditure to secure its leader with both internal and external threat. Later in 2002, there was another attempt to make a market liberalization reform, which the government tries to let the demand and supply determine the price level, which used to be controlled by the central government. It also gave some authority to local producers to make some economic decisions by themselves. Other than the decentralization policy, North Korea also kept trying to induce foreign investors in several ways, including depreciation of its currency and the initiation of Sinuiju Special Administrative District. Still, its solution to successfully reform its economy appears to be contradicting with its leader security regimes. Kim Jong-il's goal, ‚Äúkangsong taeguk‚Äù or ‚Äúrich nation/strong army,‚Äù appears to be unachievable. It caused him facing a reform dilemma. Opening up the country likely to facilitate the reform to be successful, while it would also make its dictatorship insecure.

Stone studied composition at the California Institute of the Arts with Morton Subotnick and James Tenney and has composed electro- acoustic music almost exclusively since 1972. As an undergrad at CalArts, he had a work-study job in the Music Library, which had many thousands of LP records in the circulating collection (this was 1973). The collection included a lot of western classical music of course but also a really comprehensive world music collection, avant-garde, electronic music, jazz and more. Because the librarians were concerned that the LPs, many of which were rare, would soon become unlistenable at the hands of the students and faculty, his job was to take every disc and record it onto cassette, a kind of back-up operation. He soon discovered that he could monitor the output of any of the recordings he was making and even mix them together without disturbing the recordings. So, he began to experiment, making musical collages, and started to develop habits of combining disparate musical materials. In addition to his composition and performance schedule, he is a faculty member in the Department of Information Media, School of Information Science and Technology at Chukyo University in Japan. Stone utilizes a laptop computer as his primary instrument and his works often feature very slowly developing manipulations of samples of acoustic music, speech, or other sounds. Because of this, as well as his preference for tonal melodic and harmonic materials similar to those used in popular musics, Stone's work has been associated with the movement known as minimalism. Prior to his settling on the laptop, in the 1980s, he created a number of electronic and collage works utilizing various electronic equipment as well as turntables. Prominent works from this period include Dong Il Jang (1982) and Shibucho (1984), both of which subjected a wide variety of appropriated musical materials (e.g. Okinawan folk song, European Renaissance music, 1960s Motown, etc.) to fragmentation and looping. In this way his work paralleled innovations being made in the early days of rap and hip hop (e.g. Grandmaster Flash, of whose work he was unaware at the time). It was during this period that he began naming many of his works after his favorite restaurants (often Asian ones). His first residency in Japan, sponsored by the Asian Cultural Council, was from November 1988 to April 1989. While living in Tokyo he collected more than 50 hours of recordings of the city's urban soundscape, which he later used as the basis for his radio composition Kamiya Bar, sponsored by Tokyo FM radio, and released on a CD of the same name by the Italian label NewTone / Robi Droli. Stone has collaborated frequently with Asian performers, including traditional instrumentalists such as Min Xiao-Fen (pipa), Yumiko Tanaka (shamisen), Kazue Sawai (koto), Michiko Akao (ryuteki), and those working with modern instruments, such as Otomo Yoshihide (turntables, guitar), Kazuhisa Uchihashi (guitar, daxophone), Yuji Takahashi (computer, piano), and vocalists such as Reisu Saki and Haco. He has also collaborated on an album with Hirohito Ihara's Radicalfashion and recently with Alfred Harth who partly lives in Korea. Beginning in the early years of the 21st century, Stone began to compose more frequently for acoustic instruments and ensembles, completing a new work for the San Francisco Bay Area-based American Baroque. Stone served as president of the American Music Center from 1992 to 1995, and was director of Meet the Composer/California from 1981 to 1997. He also served as music director of KPFK-FM in Los Angeles from 1978 to 1981. For many years, Stone has divided his time between San Francisco and Japan. Stone received a 1999 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.

Lindalino successfully revolted against the flying island of Laputa. The name Lindalino is a play on words of Dublin. Laputa had several methods of enforcing obedience from its subject towns. The island could be made to hover over a city indefinitely, depriving them of sunlight and rain. In more extreme situations, this would be combined with dropping large rocks on the inhabitants. Finally, the Laputans had the ability to lower their island directly onto a town, utterly destroying it. This was exceedingly rare, due to the risk it would pose to the integrity of Laputa itself. As a result of oppressions and tribute demanded from them by Laputa, the Lindalinians rebelled against their governor and constructed tall towers at each of the four corners of the city. On top of these, they placed powerful lodestones, or magnets. The result of this was that when Laputa approached them, it was pulled toward these towers more swiftly than the king had expected. As a test, the Laputans then dropped several pieces of adamant, the substance from which their island was constructed. These were violently drawn to the towers. Realizing the situation, the king of Laputa had no choice but to give in to Lindalino's conditions. If he had not, the island would have been fixed in place and overthrown. The story of Lindalino is an allegory for Great Britain's impositions on Ireland. Swift had earlier written a series of pamphlets, known as Drapier's Letters, to rouse public opinion on the matter. Lindalino represents Dublin, and the impositions of Laputa represent the British imposition of William Wood's currency. Early publications of Gulliver's Travels, including those by Benjamin Motte and George Faulkner, did not include the passage relating to Lindalino, for fear of political reprisal. It was not until 1899 that the passage was finally included in a new edition of the Collected Works. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.

In forewords which are personally delivered by Maryland's lame-duck Governor Lane and by Virginia's and North Carolina's Governors Battle and Scott, respectively, these eminent and honorable officials convey the solemn idea that what you are about to see is something that will prove to you how profitless crime is ... However, the whole thing, concocted and directed by Andrew L. Stone, is a straight exercise in low sadism. And the reactions at the Strand yesterday among the early audience, made up mainly of muscular youths, might have shocked and considerably embarrassed the governors mentioned above.\\" Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"Andrew Stone (Julie/Cry Terror!/The Steel Trap) effectively directs this enjoyable action-filled B film crime drama that wants us to know that 'crime doesn't pay.'\\" References External links  Highway 301 informational site and DVD review at DVD Beaver (includes images) * Category:1950 films Category:1950 crime drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American crime drama films Category:American drama road movies Category:English-language films Category:Film noir Category:Films about bank robbery Category:Films directed by Andrew L.

It is a major teaching hospital for tertiary health care with a reputation in clinical research. The hospital is managed as part of Melbourne Health which comprises the Royal Melbourne Hospital, North West Dialysis Service and North Western Mental Health. The Melbourne Health Chief Executive is Christine Kilpatrick AO. The emergency department is at the City Campus, 300 Grattan Street, Parkville. History 1868 wood engraving of the Melbourne Hospital in its original location. Established in 1848 as the Melbourne Hospital, it was one of Melbourne's leading hospitals. Originally located on the corner of Swanston and Lonsdale Streets, Melbourne in 1935 the hospital was renamed the Royal Melbourne Hospital and, in 1944, it moved to Grattan Street, Parkville by provision of lands in the Royal Melbourne Hospital Act. The old buildings then became home to the Queen Victoria Hospital. The Royal Women's Hospital was previously located in Carlton, Melbourne. The hospital moved in late 2008 to a new building, the new Royal Women's Hospital, co-located on the Royal Melbourne Hospital site in Parkville. =World War II= During World War II, the Parkville hospital, which was under construction, was occupied by the US Army 4th General Hospital between 1942 and 1944. While the hospital was under construction a temporary tent hospital was set up by the US Army in Royal Park just north of the hospital. Upon completion of the Parkville hospital the patients were moved progressively into the new accommodation which catered for 2,900 beds. Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1943 Then-modern interior of Parkville's Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1945. The Royal Melbourne Hospital continued to operate from their old premises on the corner of Lonsdale and Swanston Streets until the 4th General Hospital moved to Finschhaven in New Guinea in 1944. The Parkville buildings were reconditioned and the Royal Melbourne Hospital finally moved into their \\"new\\" premises in December 1944. Services and specialties provided The Royal Melbourne Hospital provides acute tertiary referral services at its main site on Grattan Street between Flemington Road and Royal Parade and ancillary services such as aged care, rehabilitation, ambulatory care and residential and community services through its Royal Park site. It has one of the largest Emergency Departments in Victoria and is, with the Alfred Hospital, one of Victoria's two major trauma referral centres. The emergency facilities include: 2 trauma bays, 7 resuscitation cubicles, 25 general cubical beds and 17 short-stay beds. There is also a helipad on top of the hospital so that urgent cases that need to be airlifted from regional areas can be transferred to the Royal Melbourne. Most medical and surgical specialties are available at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. It is one of very few public hospitals in the Australasia that routinely performs robotic surgery.

As a major specialist paediatric hospital in Victoria, the Royal Children's Hospital provides a full range of clinical services, tertiary care, as well as health promotion and prevention programs for children and young people. The hospital is the designated statewide major trauma centre for paediatrics in Victoria and a Nationally Funded Centre for cardiac and liver transplantation. Its campus partners are the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and The University of Melbourne Department of Paediatrics, which are based onsite at the hospital. The hospital is surrounded by the parkland of Royal Park, with views of trees and much natural light. History The hospital was established in 1870 and moved to its present site in Parkville on the corner of Flemington Road and Gatehouse Street in 1963. The Royal Children's Hospital was founded by Doctors John Singleton and William Smith, in response to their serious concerns about infant mortality in the fledgling city of Melbourne. The original \\"Free Hospital for Sick Children\\" was set up in a small house at 39 Stephen Street (now 49 Exhibition Street) and treated more than 1,000 children in its first year of operation. New RCH site In 2005, the Victorian State Government announced plans to build a brand new 340 bed home for RCH adjacent to the current site. The winning bid of the redevelopment is led by Babcock & Brown with architects Billard Leece Partnership and Bates Smart Architects. HKS Inc. Architects of Dallas, Texas provided Pediatric Design and Planning Services and consulting engineers Norman Disney & Young. Work commenced on the site in late 2007, and was complete in late 2011, opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on her Royal Tour. Demolition of the old site was complete by December 2012, after the transition to the new facility. Patients were moved into the new hospital in November 2011. After the move, much of the old site was turned back into parkland, creating a new gateway to Royal Park. Landscaping of the park was complete by 2015. Good Friday Appeal The Good Friday Appeal is held annually to raise money for the hospital. It has been broadcast on the Seven TV network for 52 years. The goal of the Appeal is to ensure that children with life-threatening illnesses receive the best possible medical and clinical care. The 2009 Appeal raised $13,862,734. The 2010 Appeal raised $14,462,000. The 2011 Appeal raised $15,156,000. The 2012 Appeal raised $15,820,640. The 2013 appeal raised $16,405,534.65.Victorians raise $16.4m for the kids as part of Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal, Brigid O'Connell, March 30, 2013, Herald Sun The 2016 Appeal, raised $17,445,624. The 2017 Appeal, raised $17,605,662. A new record was set in 2018, with the appeal raising $18,043,25. Centre for Adolescent Health, Gender Service The RCH Centre for Adolescent Health, Gender Service provides a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment, care and treatment of Gender Dysphoria for children aged 3 to 17 years. In 2003 it received 1 referral, increasing to 7 referrals in 2007. In 2015 it was expected that there would be more than 150 referrals, with a one-year waiting list. The Andrews government said it will spend an extra $6 million over four years to reduce waiting times. During 2016 the gender clinic is expecting to receive at least 250 referrals. A joint study by the Royal Children's Hospital and the Monash Medical Centre, found that in a cohort of children with gender identity disorder, the condition persisted into adolescence and adulthood in only 16% of cases.

The unfinished, ruined mansion, was built by a Scottish planter named William Kellie-Smith. According to differing accounts, it was either a gift for his wife or a home for his son. Kellie's Castle is situated beside the Raya River (Sungai Raya), which is a small creek to the Kinta River.  Background  William Kellie-Smith (1870‚Äî1926) was born in 1870 in Kellas, Moray Firth, Scotland. In 1890, at the age of 20, he arrived in Malaya as a civil engineer. He joined Charles Alma Baker's survey firm, who had won concessions from the state government to clear 9,000 hectares of forests in Batu Gajah, Perak. With the substantial profits made from his business venture with Baker, Kellie-Smith bought 1,000 acres (405 ha) of jungle land in the district of Kinta and started planting rubber trees and dabbled in the tin mining industry. In time, he named his estate \\"Kinta Kellas\\" after his home farm \\"Easter Kellas\\". Kellie-Smith went on to own the Kinta Kellas Tin Dredging Company as well. With his fortune made, he returned home to marry his Scottish sweetheart, Agnes, and brought her over to Malaya in 1903. They had a daughter named Helen the following year. In 1909 Kellie-Smith built his first mansion, \\"Kellas House\\", which was so unique that it was even mentioned in the London Financier newspaper on 15 September 1911. (Kellie-Smith's mansion is accessible from the main road across a bridge over a stream.) History In 1915, with the birth of his son and heir Anthony, Kellie-Smith started planning for a huge castle with Scottish, Moorish, and Tamilvanan Indian architecture. Kellie-Smith brought in 70 craftsmen Tamilvanan from Madras, India. All the bricks and marble were imported from India, too. Included in the plan for the 6-storey tower was Malaysia's first elevator, an indoor tennis court and a rooftop courtyard for entertaining. During construction, a virulent strain of Spanish flu struck his workmen. When his workmen approached him to build a temple nearby, Kellie- Smith readily agreed. In return for his generosity, they built a statue of him beside the other deities on the lord murugan temple wall. It is believed that a tunnel was built to the temple from the castle. (Descendants of the Tamil labourers brought over to Malaya to work on the mansion still live nearby even now.) William Kellie-Smith died at the age of 56 of pneumonia during a short trip to Lisbon, Portugal in 1926. William's wife was devastated and decided to move back to Scotland; construction on the castle was never completed by Tamilvanan workers. In the end, Kellas House, later known as \\"Kellie's Folly\\" or \\"Kellie's Castle,\\" was sold to a British company called Harrisons and Crosfield. Kellie's Castle today Kellies Castle and the landscape in 2018 Kellie's Castle is now a popular local tourist attraction, with some believing it to be haunted. It was used as a setting in the 1999 film Anna and the King and 2000 film Skyline Cruisers.Thiedeman, Roger (3 December 2000). \\"Kellie's Castle: Fantasy or folly?\\". The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka).

People with myosarcoma often wake up with the feeling as if they had a cramp during their sleep. Leiomyosarcoma is sarcoma of smooth muscle, and rhabdomyosarcoma is sarcoma of striated muscle. However, the term myosarcoma itself still appears in the literature.

A benign tumor originating from the same tissue is termed leiomyoma. While it has been believed that leiomyosarcomas do not arise from leiomyomas, there are leiomyoma variants for which classification is evolving. About 1 in 100,000 people get diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma (LMS) each year. LMS is one of the more common types of soft-tissue sarcoma, representing 10 percent to 20 percent of new cases. (Leiomyosarcoma of the bone is more rare.) Sarcoma is rare, consisting of only 1 percent of cancer cases in adults. Leiomyosarcomas can be very unpredictable. They can remain dormant for long periods of time and recur after years. It is a resistant cancer, meaning generally not very responsive to chemotherapy or radiation. The best outcomes occur when it can be removed surgically with wide margins early, while small and still in situ. Mechanism Smooth muscle cells make up the involuntary muscles, which are found in most parts of the body, including the uterus, stomach and intestines, the walls of all blood vessels, and the skin. It is therefore possible for leiomyosarcomas to appear at any site in the body. They are most commonly found in the uterus, stomach, small intestine and retroperitoneum. Uterine leiomyosarcomas come from the smooth muscle in the muscle layer of the uterus. Cutaneous leiomyosarcomas derive from the pilo-erector muscles in the skin. Gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas might come from smooth muscle in the GI tract or, alternatively, also from a blood vessel. At most other primary sites‚Äîretroperitoneal extremity (in the abdomen, behind the intestines), truncal, abdominal organs, etc.‚Äîleiomyosarcomas appear to grow from the muscle layer of a blood vessel (the tunica media). Thus, a leiomyosarcoma can have a primary site of origin anywhere in the body where there is a blood vessel. The tumors are usually hemorrhagic and soft and microscopically marked by pleomorphism, abundant (15‚Äì30 per 10 high power fields) abnormal mitotic figures, and coagulative tumor cell necrosis. There is a wide differential diagnosis, which includes spindle cell carcinoma, spindle cell melanoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and even biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma. Diagnosis Histopathology of leiomyosarcoma shows variable atypia, often with cytoplasmic vacuoles at both ends of nuclei, and frequent mitoses. Topic Completed: 1 November 2012. Revised: 11 September 2019 Diagnosis of LMS is made by performing a soft tissue biopsy and examining its histopathology. Treatment Surgery, with as wide a margin of removal as possible, has generally been the most effective and preferred way to attack LMS. If surgical margins are narrow or not clear of tumor, however, or in some situations where tumor cells were left behind, chemotherapy or radiation has been shown to give a clear survival benefit. While LMS tends to be resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, each case is different and results can vary widely. For metastatic (widespread) disease, chemotherapy and targeted therapies are the first choices. Chemotherapy regimens are: doxorubicin/ ifosfamide and doxorubicin combination/gemcitabine and docetaxel/ trabectedin pazopanib is the targeted therapy used in metastatic leiomyosarcoma as second line and is well tolerated. LMS of uterine origin often respond to hormonal treatments. As of 2020, there are several active clinical trials for uterine LMS. Notable cases People who have had leiomyosarcoma include: * Leicester City footballer Keith Weller who made over 300 appearances for the Foxes, scoring 47 goals. Also made four appearances for England, scoring one goal * Katie Price. * Canadian public health physician Sheela Basrur (1956‚Äì2008), who developed uterine leiomyosarcoma in 2006. * American actress Diana Sands * Canadian comedian Irwin Barker, who was featured in a documentary, \\"That's My Time\\", which chronicled his battle with leiomyosarcoma. * E.

It is sometimes (incorrectly) called Slim the Lineman. The picture is a film adaptation of the 1934 novel Slim by William Wister Haines, which concerns linemen in the electric power industry. The supporting cast features Margaret Lindsay and Jane Wyman. Plot Slim, a farmer from southeastern Ohio, becomes fascinated by a crew of linemen erecting transmission towers across his uncle and aunt's property. He asks Pop (J. Farrell MacDonald) for a job, but there are no openings. When a man is fired, however, Red (Pat O'Brien), Pop's best lineman, takes a liking to Slim and persuades Pop to give him a chance as a \\"grunt\\", an assistant on the ground who sends up tools and parts. Red and Stumpy (Stuart Erwin), another grunt, teach Slim what he needs to know. Slim wins the respect of Red and Pop when he spots cheating during a poker game and pitches in during the ensuing brawl. When hungover lineman Wyatt Ranstead falls and is killed, Slim is promoted to lineman. The company sends a vice president to investigate the death. To save Pop's job, Red deliberately antagonizes the executive and is fired. Slim gets himself dismissed out of loyalty, and the two go on the road. They head to Chicago to see Red's girlfriend, Cally (Margaret Lindsay) a nurse. The three set out to have a good time (though Red insists on paying for everything). Slim finds himself falling for Cally, and she for him. When Red's money runs out, he and Slim head off to New Mexico for work. Red knows and dislikes one of their fellow linemen, Wilcox (Joe Sawyer). When Red is later offered the job of foreman at another camp, he initially turns it down, but changes his mind when Slim offers to be his \\"straw boss\\" (assistant). Wilcox, who had been hoping for the promotion himself, tries to sabotage Red's rope, but Slim stops him. Later, on the ground, Wilcox pulls out a knife and stabs Slim. While Slim is recovering in the hospital, Cally comes to nurse him. They admit they love each other and tell Red they are going to get married. When Slim is offered stable, safe maintenance work, Cally accepts for him. Slim, however, refuses to give up his dangerous profession, and when Pop sends for Red, goes with him. They arrive during a terrible blizzard, and are called out to a substation to restore power, even though there are \\"hot\\" wires all around. Red and another man fall to their deaths when a line breaks. Cally joins Slim and once again tries to talk him out of line work.

Presentation Presentation varies from person to person. Some people have discrete attacks, which can last between 10 and 120 minutes while others are symptomatic almost constantly due to atmospheric humidity levels and/or sweating. Itching most frequently occurs on the legs, arms, chest, back, and abdomen, though it can also occur elsewhere. Itching on contact with water that also includes hives is known as Aquagenic Urticaria. Pathogenesis The exact mechanism of the condition is unknown. Some studies have suggested the itching occurs in response to increased fibrinolytic activity in the skin, inappropriate activation of the sympathetic nervous system, or increased activity of Acetylcholinesterase. Diagnosis No definitive medical test is known for aquagenic pruritus. Rather, diagnosis is made by excluding all other possible causes of the patient's itching, including polycythemia vera. Since pruritus is a symptom of many serious diseases, it is important to rule out other causes before making a final diagnosis. Treatment Since the cause of the condition cannot be fully avoided in all cases, treatment is usually focused on topical itch management. This can be effected by the application of antipruritic lotions or creams, using phototherapy, or the application of hot or cold packs to the skin after water contact. Paradoxically, hot baths or showers help many patients, possibly because heat causes mast cells in the skin to release their supply of histamine and to remain depleted for up to 24 hours afterward. H1 and H2 blockers, such as loratadine, doxepin, or cimetidine, have historically been the first line of pharmacological treatment, but not all sufferers find relief with these medications. When antihistamines do work, loratadine seems to be the most effective for mild cases and doxepin most effective for more severe cases. Naltrexone, hydrocortisone, or propranolol may relieve itching for some people. Sertraline or other Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is also a line of treatment. Beta-Alanine has been found to suppress or reduce the symptoms experienced by some individuals and is shared anecdotally in support groups, there is yet to be a study conducted. Etymology The name is derived from Latin: aquagenic, meaning water- induced, and pruritus, meaning itch.

According to the Bible, Naaman was a commander of the army of Syria. He was a good commander and was held in favor because of the victory that God brought him. Yet Naaman was a leper. Naaman's wife had a servant girl from Israel who said that a prophet there would be able to heal him. Naaman tells his lord this and he is sent to Israel with a letter to the king. The king of Israel didn't know what to do, yet Elisha (Eliseus) sent a message to the King, advising that the King tell Naaman to come to see him. Elisha then told Naaman to go bathe in the Jordan seven times and he would be clean. Naaman was angry and would have left, but his servant asked him to try it and he was healed. A servant of Elisha, Gehazi, seeing Naaman being turned away from offering God offerings ran after him and falsely asked for clothing and silver for visitors. And the leprosy from Naaman fell on Gehazi and would remain in his descendants. Tanakh Naaman is mentioned in of the Tanakh in Hebrew as \\"◊ï÷∞÷†◊†÷∑◊¢÷≤◊û÷∏◊ü ◊©÷∑◊Ç◊®÷æ ◊¶÷∞◊ë÷∏÷®◊ê ◊û÷∂÷Ω◊ú÷∂◊ö÷∞÷æ ◊ê÷≤◊®÷∏÷ú◊ù\\" or \\"Naaman captain of the army of the King of Aram\\". According to the narrative, he is called a mezora (◊û÷∞÷º◊¶÷π◊®÷∏◊¢), a person affected by the skin disease tzaraath (◊¶÷∏÷º◊®÷∑◊¢÷∑◊™, tzara'at).Often translated as leprosy, this illness or affliction, was not today's leprosy. Leprosy as known today did not come to Ancient Israel until Alexander the Great came back from a trip to India in the mid-300s BCE. When the Hebrew slave-girl who waits on his wife tells her of a Jewish prophet in Samaria who can cure her master, he obtains a letter from King Ben-Hadad II of Aram to King Joram of Israel in which the former asks Joram to arrange for the healing of his subject Naaman. Naaman proceeds with the letter to King Joram. The king of Israel suspects in this ‚Äì to him ‚Äì impossible request a pretext of Syria for later starting a war against him, and tears his clothes. When the prophet Elisha hears about this, he sends for general Naaman. But rather than personally receiving Naaman when the latter arrives at Elisha's house, Elisha merely sends a messenger to the door who tells Naaman to cure his affliction by dipping himself seven times in the Jordan River. Naaman, a man of heathen faith who is unfamiliar with the Jewish mezora, who had expected the prophet himself to come out to him and perform some kind of impressive ritual magic, angrily refuses, and prepares to go home unhealed. Only after Naaman's slaves suggest to their master that he has nothing to lose by at least giving it a try since the task is a simple and easy one, he takes his bath in the Jordan river as a mikveh as told and finds himself healed. The mikveh is a bath used for ritual immersion in Judaism. Naaman returns to Elisha with lavish gifts, which Elisha flatly refuses to accept. Naaman also renounces his former god Rimmon after being cured by Elisha and accepts the God of Israel. He does, however, ask that the God of Israel pardon him when he enters the temple of Rimmon as part of his obligations to the king of Syria. New Testament Naaman is also paraphrased in of the New Testament, in Greek as \\"ŒùŒ±ŒπŒº·Ω∞ŒΩ ·ΩÅ Œ£œçœÅŒøœÇ\\" or \\"Naaman the Syrian\\", a leper. Christian theology depicts Naaman as an example for the will of God to save people who are considered by men as less than pious and unworthy of salvation. The Septuagint, the Greek Old Testament, uses the word baptizein for the dipping that heals the heathen Naaman from the skin disease called tzaraath. The new baptism takes place in the Jordan River where Jesus of Nazareth, also called the Christ by his followers, was baptized many centuries later. Christians have often interpreted the Naaman story as prefiguring the Christian church rite of baptism.

It is based at the Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal, England. History In 1984, Christina Hardyment had written an account of her own investigations into the real-life places and real-life people in Arthur Ransome's stories. As a direct result of this book, Arthur Ransome and Captain Flint's Trunk, people interested in forming a society dedicated to Arthur Ransome had been leaving their contact details at Abbot Hall, where, following his death in 1967, his widow Evgenia had donated various articles, including his writing desk. In 1989, Christina followed up on these contact details by sending an appeal for funds to restore the dilapidated Mavis, the supposed prototype for Arthur Ransome's Amazon. The response to this appeal was overwhelming and in June 1990 The Arthur Ransome Society was formed. A particularly large sum came from the Arthur Ransome Club (ARC) of Japan. The ceremony was attended by Christina Hardyment, Tamami Nakayama of ARC and Brigit Sanders (n√©e Altounyan), a prototype of the character Bridget Walker. Brigit Sanders subsequently became President of TARS. In 1997, the society was incorporated as a Company Limited by Guarantee. TARS now TARS produces several regular publications, holds many recreational and scholarly events and maintains a Ransome-themed website . TARS has a wide international membership base which includes branches in Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand. In the UK there are 6 different regions: Scottish, Northern, Midland, Eastern, South Western and Southern, each with its own leadership committee. They also organize local events which are open all members. Every year one region in the UK takes its turn to host the International Annual General Meeting (IAGM).

In the sixties and throughout the seventies, Reed was one of the highest-paid and most in-demand writers of celebrity profiles. His writing style was considered an exemplar of The New Journalism and his profile of the aging Ava Gardner was included and praised in Tom Wolfe's anthology, The New Journalism. After Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1992 for her work in My Cousin Vinny, Reed said publicly that she had not actually won the award and that presenter Jack Palance had accidentally read the wrong name off of the card he was reading. When it was pointed out that the card only had one name on it, Reed changed his theory to say that Palance had actually read the wrong name off the Teleprompter and claimed that the Academy went along with it because they would have been embarrassed to admit that mistake in front of a huge viewing audience. Reed was publicly rebutted by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse, who said that if a presenter ever announced the wrong winner a PwC representative would go on stage and state that the wrong result had been announced and then either state the correct result himself or give the information to someone on stage to correct it. Roger Ebert said that Reed's conspiracy theories were false and unfair to Tomei and that Reed owed her an apology. In a 2005 review of the South Korean movie Oldboy, Reed wrote: The Village Voice, which stated that \\"online forums erupted in protest\\" at the review, then mocked Reed by imagining him applying similar logic to films from other countries. In a 2013 review of Identity Thief, Reed made several references to Melissa McCarthy's weight, referring to her as \\"tractor-sized\\", \\"humongous\\", \\"obese\\", and a \\"hippo\\". Film critic Richard Roeper said, \\"This just smacks of mean-spirited name-calling in lieu of genuine criticism.\\" The review was referenced at the 85th Academy Awards on February 24, 2013, by the host, Seth MacFarlane, who joked that Reed would review Adele for singing \\"Skyfall\\" at the ceremony. In a column for The Huffington Post, Candy Spelling likened Reed's review to bullying. Reed stood by his comments and stated his objection to the use of serious health issue such as obesity as comedy talking points. He dismissed the outrage as being orchestrated for publicity, but praised McCarthy for not getting involved in the matter, calling her \\"completely classy\\". In 2016, Reed published a review of The Whole Truth in which he obsesses over star Ren√©e Zellweger‚Äôs face. He wrote In the same review, he also mocked actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw‚Äôs name, calling her: In a 2017 review of The Shape of Water, he referred to people with disabilities as \\"defective creatures\\" and Sally Hawkins' mute character as \\"mentally handicapped\\". =Factual errors in reviews= Reed's 2012 review for The Cabin in the Woods contained significant factual inaccuracies in his summary of the film, and exhibited a dismissive attitude towards anyone who disagreed with his negative opinion. L Magazine's Henry Stewart noted: \\"his review is literally about 50 percent inaccurate‚Äîfactually, objectively wrong.\\" His professionalism was also called into question when, in addition to the factual inaccuracies, many felt he was needlessly insulting and mean-spirited towards those who enjoyed the film. In 2013, Reed reviewed V/H/S/2, despite walking out of the film within its first 20 minutes. As a result, his review was brief and incorrectly summarized Jason Eisener's segment of the horror anthology. Many felt that Reed was unprofessional, with journalist Sam Adams stating that Reed was \\"making a mockery of a noble profession while intelligent critics scramble for crumbs all around him\\". In 2017, Reed's review of The Shape of Water mistook the film's writer and director Guillermo del Toro for actor Benicio del Toro (the two are not related; he also misspelled Benicio as Benecio). Reed's review was criticized and ridiculed for referring to Hawkins' mute character as \\"mentally handicapped\\" and for erroneously crediting Benicio del Toro as the film's director. Reed also described Guillermo del Toro's native country as Spain, despite him coming from Mexico, and Benicio del Toro himself coming from Puerto Rico. The same year he included the film Get Out on his list of 10 Worst Films of 2017, and later sardonically stated in a CBS Sunday Morning interview, \\"I didn't care if all the black men are turned into robots.\\" A writer on Sunday Mornings website noted that there were no actual robots in the film. Personal life Reed lives in a two-bedroom apartment at The Dakota apartment building in New York City,Tribune Media Services via The Buffalo News, June 9, 2006 which he bought for $30,000 in 1969. In 2018, Reed stated: =Shoplifting arrest and clearing= In February 2000, Reed was arrested for shoplifting after leaving a Tower Records in Manhattan with compact discs by Mel Torm√©, Peggy Lee, and Carmen McRae in his jacket pockets. Reed, who had just purchased two other CDs, says he forgot about the other three CDs and his offer to pay for them was refused. The charges were later dropped.\\"Rex Reed blames his arrest on fever of forgetfulness\\", USA Today, February 17, 2000 According to Reed, several days after the arrest Peggy Lee sent him her entire catalog of CDs, because \\"she was so thrilled I wanted one of her CDs enough to put myself through so much hell\\".St. Louis Post-Dispatch, February 26, 2000 Bibliography   References External links * Rex Reed's New York Observer movie review archive * New York Film Critics Circle biography * Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:American film critics Category:Film theorists Category:Louisiana State University alumni Category:Male actors from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Journalists from Texas Category:The New York Observer people Category:American male film actors Category:20th-century American male actors Category:New York Daily News people Category:New York Post people Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male non-fiction writers ","title":"Rex Reed"},{"id":"2134558","text":"The Party of Bulgarian Social Democrats (, Partiya Balgarski Sotsialdemokrati, PBSD) is a social-democratic political party in Bulgaria. It is a member of the Socialist International and the Party of European Socialists. History The party was launched on 26 November 1989 under the name Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party (United). It sees itself as the historical successor to the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party of 1894. In January 1990 it adopted the name Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and in February Petar Dertliev was elected chairman. Subsequently, the party joined the Union of Democratic Forces. After a rift in the relations the BSDP left the Union and founded the \\"SDS-Centre\\" along with the movement Ekoglasnost. The coalition received 3.2% of the vote in the legislative elections in 1991 and failed to enter the National Assembly. Until 1994 BSDP participated in the coalition \\"Democratic Alternative for the Republic\\", which also failed to overcome the 4% threshold in the elections in the 1994 election. Since 1995 a process of returning to the SDS began and so the party contested the next elections in 1994 within the United Democratic Forces. Since autumn 1997 a part of the leadership seek a rapprochement with other social-democratic parties in Bulgaria. In March 1998 the Movement for Social Humanism separated from the party. An extraordinary party congress at the end of 1998 caused another split. A right wing, dissatisfied with the policies pursued by Dertlijev, split from the party and held the ties with the United Democratic Forces. The BSDP entered the centre-left Coalition for Bulgaria and in 2002, changed its name to Party of Bulgarian Social Democrats.

The TV series, produced by P Productions, Seven Arts Television and Krantz Films, was aired on Fuji TV from July 4, 1966, to June 26, 1967, lasting a total of 52 episodes. It is the first color tokusatsu TV series in Japan, beating Tsuburaya Productions' Ultraman to the air by six days. The show later aired in the US, dubbed in English, as The Space Giants. Digital Manga crowdfunded the manga, and it is currently available for digital purchase on their Emanga site. Basic plot The alien invader Goa plots to conquer Earth. He first warns the Murakami family (father Atsushi, mother Tomoko, and son Mamoru) of their invasion, and demonstrates his powers by transporting them to a prehistoric jungle and destroying a Giant Dinosaur (in reality, Agon, the title monster of a Godzilla-like TV series) before their very eyes. But they will not agree to surrender to Goa, so hope comes in the form of Magma, an armored, golden giant with long hair and antennae. He and his human-sized wife Mol, both of whom were created by the wizard Earth (who indeed lives deep beneath the Earth), are sent to defend our world against Goa. They befriend Atsushi and Mamoru; the latter has touched Magma emotionally, as he wanted to have a child with his wife Mol, so Earth creates a duplicate of Mamoru, whom he names Gam, and who wears a white helmet, with built-in antennae, on his head. Earth gives Mamoru a whistle, with which he can call Gam (when blown once), Mol (when blown twice) and Magma (when blown thrice) in times of crisis. So when Goa unleashes his various daikaiju, chances are that Magma, Mol, and/or Gam will fly to the rescue. Ambassador Magma Ambassador Magma, despite his robot-like appearance, is not a true robot, but actually a living giant forged from gold. In fact, true to his original manga appearance, in the series pilot opening, Tetsuya Uozumi, the actor who played Magma, actually wore gold make-up on his face. But such difficulties as Uozomi's own face turning beet-red, drowning out the gold makeup, quickly arose. The solution proved to be an easy one; in all the show's subsequent episodes, Uozumi wore a golden human-like mask. Magma, just like his human-sized wife Mol and son Gam, transforms into a giant rocketship. Indeed, he is considered one of the earliest transforming mecha, even before the anime super robot, Brave Raideen, which set the standard for the genre. He also shoots rockets out of a panel located in his chest, and (as do Mol and Gam) shoots electrical bolts from his antennae. US version (The Space Giants) The Space Giants is the English title of this series. The show is most notable for its humanoid robot heroes who responded to crises by transforming into rockets to combat a wide variety of dinosaur-like space monsters, and faceless, ninja-like villains called Lugo men (‰∫∫Èñì„É¢„Éâ„Ç≠ ningen- modoki literally mock-human) whose corpses melted into oozing blob-like slime whenever they were killed. The main conflict of the story involved an evil space villain named Rodak who continually tried to conquer Earth by sending a new dinosaur-like monster from deep space to attack Japan. The stories were generally resolved in two to four episodes,https://firebreathingdimetrodon.wordpress.com/2016/12/25/what-were- not-watching-the-space-giants/ much like the BBC's Doctor Who, and a new monster would be found by Rodak to begin another two- to four-part struggle. Rodak's efforts were opposed by an ancient white-bearded wizard named Methusan (sometimes called Methuselah or Mathusem), aided by a trio of humanoid robots who were all capable of transformations from humanoid form into rocket forms. The human interest in the story was a family of three: a boy named Mikko, his mother Tomoko, and his journalist father Ito Mura. The family became involved in the story due to the villain Rodak's desire to publish news of his presence to world media. The Mura family found themselves continually caught in the crossfire of monster attacks and harried by the Lugo men and Rodak's spies. A major sub-plot in the series developed when Mikko's mother was kidnapped by the Lugo men and held in uncertain conditions for a number of episodes. In the first episodes, the robot team were a duo consisting of a gold robot aptly named Goldar and his companion, a silver-clad humanoid female named Silvar. It was implied that they had been created by the wizard Methusan. Early in the series, the wizard Methusan completed the team to mirror the Mura family by creating a humanoid rocket-boy named Gam, in the image of Mikko Mura, complete with his trademark red-and-white sweater vest. All members of the robot team were capable of transforming into rockets identified respectively by gold, silver, and red-and-white color schemes. Each had bulb-tipped antennae protruding from their heads, capable of discharging directed blasts of gamma rays. Goldar and Silvar were capable of firing missiles from their chest cavities, but Silvar was only shown doing this once. A regularly featured plot device was Mikko's ability to summon the robots by blowing a special high- frequency whistle: once to summon Gam, twice to summon Silvar and three times to summon Goldar. The show first aired in Japan on July 4, 1966, and its international title was Space Avenger (one episode was dubbed for international markets). Originally intending to title it Monsters from Outer Space, the entire series was dubbed into English by Bernard H. Schulman's Lakeside Television Company and syndicated to a limited number of US television stations in early September 1970 (such as WSNS-TV Channel 44 in Chicago and WTAF-TV Channel 29 in Philadelphia), under the title The Space Giants. The show was not distributed widely to US television stations until the late 1970s, when it became a staple of fledgling Superstation TBS afternoon programming. 52 episodes were made, each running 25 minutes. It was known in Spanish as Monstruos del Espacio and in some English-speaking countries as Space Avenger. As of late January and early February 2017, Bernard Schulman still owned the North American television and home video distribution rights to The Space Giants, under his Lakeside Television banner. At that time, rumors continued to circulate that the series would be issued in Blu-ray and Digital HD format for the 50th Anniversary in 2016, exclusively produced and distributed through AnimeImages and Lakeside Television Company in a joint partnership for production and distribution. Ambassador Magma makes a cameo appearance in the 2004 Astro Boy: Omega Factor game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, along with a number of other characters created by Osamu Tezuka. =U.S. version name changes= *Magma ‚Äì Goldar *Mol ‚Äì Silvar *Gam ‚Äì (same) *Goa ‚Äì Rodak *Atsushi Murakami ‚Äì Ito \\"Tom\\" Mura *Tomoko Murakami ‚Äì Tomoko Mura *Mamoru Murakami ‚Äì Mikko Mura *Earth ‚Äì Methusan *Atsuya Sekita ‚Äì Kita *Modoki Men ‚Äì Lugo Men =Japanese cast= *Toru Ohira ‚Äì Goa (both suit actor and voice actor) *Toshio Egi ‚Äì Mamoru Murakami *Tetsuya Uozumi ‚Äì Ambassador Magma (suit actor, voice actor in episode 1/pilot) **Yoshio Kaneuchi ‚Äì Ambassador Magma (voice actor) *Masumi Okada ‚Äì Atsushi Murakami *Machiko Yashiro ‚Äì Tomoko Murakami *Shigeko Mise ‚Äì Mol *Hideki Ninomiya ‚Äì Gam **Masako Nozawa ‚Äì Gam (voice actor in episodes 41 and 42) *Gen Shimizu ‚Äì Earth =English cast= *Paul Hecht ‚Äì Goldar the Space Avenger, Rodak, the Narrator (first voices) **Ray Owens ‚Äì Goldar the Space Avenger, Rodak, the Narrator (second voices) *Paulette Rubinstein - *Larry Robinson ‚Äì Tom/Ito Mura *Peter Fernandez ‚Äì Kita, Additional Voices *Earl Hammond - 1993 OVA series A 13-episode OVA anime remake was produced in 1993.

With an enrollment of more than 56,000 students annually, Central Piedmont is one of the largest community colleges in the North Carolina Community College System. The college has six campuses and three centers and offers nearly 300 degree, diploma and certificate programs. The college was founded in 1963, the year the North Carolina General Assembly passed the state community college bill. It is the result of a merger between Mecklenburg College and the Central Industrial Education Center. History CPCC Central Campus From 1923 to 1959, Central High School was located on Elizabeth Avenue at Kings Drive, where Central Piedmont Community College is now located. In 1959 its students moved into the new Garinger High School. With the building vacant Charlotte College (later UNCC) used the space. Starting in 1959, the Central Industrial Education Center shared the old high school. As a result of the 1963 N.C. Community College Act, the Central Industrial Education Center and the black Mecklenburg College combined to become Central Piedmont Community College.Tom Bradbury, \\"The CPCC Story,\\" The Charlotte Observer, February 25, 1995. The three-story Central High building is now the oldest building on the CPCC campus.

The campus is set up more like a traditional university campus, housing many buildings on many different blocks. Currently, certain buildings on campus are being expanded and renovated, while others are being replaced all together. There are street car rails in the pavement of Elizabeth Avenue, which bisects through the heart of campus. The rails are for the proposed Center City Corridor. =Cato Campus= Cato campus, building III Originally named \\"Northeast Campus,\\" it is located near Reedy Creek Nature Reserve and was opened in Summer of 2002 with two buildings totaling 50,000 sq/ft. Built to relieve overcrowding at Central Campus, this location's focus area is horticulture due to its hilly and shady terrain, close proximity to local parks and ease of access to the rest of the county. It is also located in the University City section of Charlotte, the campus is only 3 miles from University of North Carolina at Charlotte, providing close proximity for students of both institutions to take classes at either campus. In the Summer of 2005, the campus was renamed after Wayland H. Cato, a retailer who donates to the College. The campus also saw expansion and has since added another building, however the main focus of the Cato Campus is still horticulture and turf management. =Harper Campus= Opened in Winter of 1998 as the Southwest Campus, this satellite campus is located on Hebron St. off of Nations Ford Rd. in Southwest Charlotte. The campus focuses on construction technologies, welding, HVAC systems, graphic design and arts, and general studies. =Levine Campus= Opened as the 'South Campus' in the fall of 1998, this satellite campus is located in southeast Mecklenburg County, in Matthews, North Carolina. The campus opened with a 116,000 sq/ft building on a 32 acres, aimed at relieving the overcrowding at the Central Campus. The campus features a book store, computer lab and a food court in a three-story building. The campus was renamed and increased to 220,000 sq/ft with the aim to make the new Levine Campus into a full-fledged college campus. In late 2005 the Levine Campus grew again, when NASCAR owner Rick Hendrick donated money to build the $4 million, 25,000 sq/ft facility, 'Joe Hendrick Center for Automotive Technology'. With the construction of I-485 right next door, the college has expanded the role for the campus, particularly for computer and information technology, as the Levine Campus houses the largest enrollment of this kind of all Central Piedmont campuses. =Merancas Campus= The first of Central Piedmont's satellite campuses, it was opened in 1990 as the North Center, eventually growing with the addition of the Public Safety building in 1996 and being renamed the North Campus. The campus is located north of Charlotte, in Huntersville, North Carolina. This campus is home to the College's Public Safety and Transportation Systems programs. In 2011 the College renamed the campus to the Merancas Campus, after longtime donor's Casey and Anke Mermans and their Merancas Foundation. =Harris Campus= Harris Campus opened in the West Charlotte area in 2001.

In his best-selling book The Damage Done, Fellows describes the violence and harsh conditions he experienced in Thailand prisons. Biography =Early life= Fellows was born in Sydney, Australia. His father Bill Fellows, was a champion jockey and horse trainer who won the 1949 Melbourne Cup on Foxzami. He was the youngest of three children, but his two-year-old sister Gail, died in 1950 from a \\"bowel complication\\". His older brother Gary died when he was 36 years old. Gary was living with his wife Carole and two sons Brett and Rodney. He also had a son named Adrian Simon who wrote \\"Milk-Blood\\". Fellows was educated at De La Salle College, a Catholic school for boys in Ashfield, New South Wales. Fellows claims he was nearly expelled from the school when he was caught running a horse betting operation from his school desk. Warren \\"left\\" De La Salle College and went to Randwick North High School. =Drug trafficking= Fellows worked in various jobs, including as a barman and an apprentice hairdresser in Double Bay. It was through his bar work that he first became involved with drug trafficking, successfully importing hash from India with a friend. On his return to Australia he married and had a child. Word got out about the successful drug run and a customer in the bar where Fellows worked employed him to travel to Los Angeles, Hawaii and South America to smuggle cocaine into Australia. Fellows came to know drug dealer William Sinclair, who took him to Bangkok, Thailand where he was introduced to Neddy Smith and made his first successful attempt at smuggling heroin into Australia. After returning to Australia, Neddy Smith who was impressed with his smuggling skills, contacted Fellows and offered him a job. Smith did not have the notoriety he had later, but was already a major and feared figure in the Sydney criminal world. Fellows claims he became involved with Smith because he was \\"young and impressionable\\" and flattered that he \\"was liked by a man most people were terrified of\\". Fellows worked for Smith as a drug courier, domestically and internationally. =Thailand= In October 1978, Smith instructed Fellows to again travel to Bangkok, this time in the company of Smith's brother-in-law Paul Hayward. Hayward played professional rugby league with the Newtown Jets and had been selected to represent Australia as a boxer at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Hayward had done \\"favours\\" for Smith, but this was his first international job. Fellows and Hayward became best friends. Prior to leaving Australia, Fellows was tipped off by a friend with a police contact at Manly, that the Commonwealth Police believed he was involved in a large drug importation operation and had him under surveillance. Fellows reported this to Smith who dismissed it, claiming that he would have been informed if it were true. Smith insisted they continue with the job. Hayward and Fellows became increasingly apprehensive, but after Smith lost his patience with them and made implied threats, they reluctantly agreed to go through with the trip. Fellows was particularly anxious about returning to Bangkok. During his last trip in February 1978, he had been forced to abandon a package of heroin he had been attempting to ship back to Australia and feared that Thai police may have found it and been able to trace the drugs back to him. So Fellows procured a false passport through a friend, in the name of a deceased child Gregory Hastings Barker. Smith later said that Fellows got done because he booked his flight using Smith's telephone, although Fellows says that he can not remember whether he booked it with Smiths phone or not. On arriving in Thailand, Fellows and Hayward met William Sinclair by chance. Sinclair now lived in Bangkok and owned the Texas Bar. Sinclair took them to his bar, and in a drunken state, attempted to obtain information from them about their trip. Unbeknown to them, the trio were under surveillance and the meeting appeared to police to incriminate Sinclair, even though according to Fellows, he was not involved. Fellows claims that there were many warning signs and that the night before they were arrested he had a \\"moment of clarity\\" and resolved to wash the heroin down the bath drain. But he fell asleep and was woken in the morning by police. =Arrest= On 12 October 1978, the rooms occupied by Fellows and Hayward at the Montien Hotel in Bangkok were raided by Thai police. The pair were arrested when 8.5 kilograms of heroin was found in a suitcase in Hayward's room. Fellows alleges they were subjected to physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Thai Narcotics Suppression Unit officers who demanded they sign statements which they could not read because they were written in Thai. The officers demanded Fellows and Hayward make statements incriminating Sinclair. Fellows claims they resisted because Sinclair was innocent, but he eventually relented when officers informed them they were to be executed without trial under Article 27 of the military law and dragged Hayward outside for execution. Fellows and Hayward agreed to sign the statement and Sinclair was arrested and charged. The three men were sent to Bambat remand centre at Klong Prem Central Prison, but after plotting an escape attempt were moved to \\"Maha Chai\\" the Special Bangkok Metropolitan Prison on Maha Chai Road (now the Bangkok Corrections Museum). They spent three years in Maha Chai before they were convicted of heroin trafficking. Sinclair and Fellows were sentenced to life imprisonment and Hayward was sentenced to 30 years' jail. They were sent to the Lard Yao prison but after five days there when Sinclair attempted to bribe the wrong guard, they were transferred to Bangkwang. Two years later, Sinclair's conviction was overturned on appeal in 1983. Hayward was later returned to Lard Yao, and later received a royal pardon and was released from Lard Yao on 7 April 1989. Fellows received a royal pardon and was released from Bangkwang on 11 January 1990. Whilst imprisoned in Thailand, Fellows attempted suicide several times, one he recalls was when he was locked into a darkroom he wrapped a sarong around his neck and tied it to a hook on the ceiling; however, he claimed as he felt his bowels fall the sarong snapped, causing him to fall, saving him. Fellows became addicted to heroin. He claimed that heroin was easily available in Thai prisons and was the only form of escape from the appalling conditions. In his autobiography The Damage Done, he expressed great sympathy for those afflicted by addiction to drugs. He writes that it was \\"an outstanding case of poetic justice\\" that he should become addicted himself. =Return to Australia= On his return to Australia, he spent two weeks in a hospital being treated for malnutrition and pneumonia. He expressed concern regarding his and Paul Hayward's ability to adapt back into society, an issue which he claims played a part in Hayward's death in 1992 from a heroin overdose. Fellows explains how he still has hallucinations of strange abnormal creatures hovering over him and watching him. Furthermore, Fellows claims that he has the same nightmare once a month, regarding him lying on a beach with two beautiful women feeling free and happy, however as he begins to walk off into the sunset he turns around and notices that the two girls have disappeared and that he is back in the Thailand Prison where a guard is calling his name telling him to go in his cell. Fellows says that although he is released from Bangkwang he will never be free from the tortures in his mind. In the late 2000s, Fellows commented in the media on the cases of the Bali Nine and Schapelle Corby. Popular culture Sheffield four-piece band Harrisons penned a song entitled Simmer Away after reading The Damage Done.

The plot details a New York City detective investigating a series of mysterious deaths connected to a disturbing website. Director Malone's second feature for Warner Bros. after the release of House on Haunted Hill (1999), FeardotCom was an international co-production between companies based in the United States, Luxembourg, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The film was shot on location in Luxembourg and Montreal, Canada. FeardotCom was released in the United States on August 30, 2002. FeardotCom received overwhelmingly negative reviews. Critics praised its cinematography, but criticized its script and performances. FeardotCom was also one of the 19 films to receive an 'F' rating from audiences polled at CinemaScore. It grossed $18.9 million worldwide against its $40 million budget.  Plot  Mike Reilly is an NYPD detective who is called to the scene of a mysterious death in the subway system. The victim, Polidori, exhibits bleeding from his eyes and other orifices and, by the frozen look on his face, appears to have seen something horrifying before being hit by a train. Department of Health researcher Terry Huston is intrigued by the find as well, particularly when several more victims show up with identical symptoms. When a contagious virus is ruled out, Terry and Mike team up to discover what might be killing these people. Initially they are unable to find anything to connect the deaths together; after some more digging for clues, they eventually discover that all of the victims' computers crashed shortly before their passings. They send each of the victims' hard drives to Mike's friend, Denise Stone, who is a forensic specialist. Denise discovers that all of the victims had visited a website called Feardotcom.com, which depicts voyeuristic torture murder. Upon looking at the site herself, Denise is subjected to various sights and sounds of torture that eventually drive her insane, resulting in her falling to her death from her apartment window. Mike feels guilty, thinking that he should have never gotten Denise involved in the case. Terry figures out that people who visit the website die within 48 hours, apparently from what they feared most in their lives. Despite such dangerous knowledge, both she and Mike visit the site in order to figure out what is happening. As they begin to experience paranoia and hallucinations (like the deceased), including that of a young girl and her inflatable ball, they race against time to figure out if any of it has any connection to an extremely vicious serial killer, Alistair Pratt, who has been eluding Mike and the FBI for years. It is revealed that Feardotcom is, in fact, a ghost site made by one of Pratt's first victims, who is seeking revenge because people watched her being tortured and murdered. She was tortured by Pratt for 48 hours before she begged him to kill her, which explains why the victims have 48 hours to live. Mike and Terry track down Pratt and release the spirit of the murdered girl from the website, which kills Pratt. However, Mike is also killed. The ending scene shows Terry lying in her bed with her cat. The phone rings but she hears no one on the line, only online static. She hangs up and hugs the cat.  Cast  Production Malone stated that his goal when agreeing to direct was to make the entire film look \\"basically like a nightmare.\\" Stephen Dorff was cast as the lead in the film, while Stephen Rea was cast as the villain based on Malone's appreciation of him as one of his \\"favorite actors.\\" Natascha McElhone was cast as the lead female role, and Malone stated in retrospect that he felt she had been miscast: \\"I mean, I love[d] having her in the film, don't get me wrong, but the film should have been rewritten for her, instead of being written for somebody who was showing off how good she is at her job. Natascha has this sort of competence and elegance, so you just don't buy that with her.\\" Jeffrey Combs, who had appeared in Malone's previous feature, House on Haunted Hill, was cast in a supporting part as a detective. Though set in New York City, the film was shot in Montreal, Qu√©bec, Canada, and in Luxembourg. Director William Malone had not intended to shoot the film in Luxembourg, but stated that the producers had scouted locations there which they believed \\"looked like\\" New York; as a result, Malone said the film ended up being a \\"weird take on New York rather than being New York.\\" Some scenes, such as those in the subway stations, were shot on constructed sets built on sound stages.Malone & Sebaldt 2003 (0:05:02) Malone stated in an audio commentary that the majority of the interiors scenes were also shot on sets.Malone & Sebaldt 2003 (0:15:01) The website featured in the film was designed by a Berlin-based digital design company.Malone & Sebaldt 2003 (0:06:49) Release The film was released on August 9, 2002 in South Korea and on August 30, 2002 in the United States. It would receive subsequent theatrical releases in numerous countries throughout the ensuing months, debuting in the United Kingdom on June 27, 2003. The film was released on DVD in January 2003. =Rating= The film was originally rated NC-17 due to extreme violence. After multiple trims and appeals, the film was finally re- rated R by the MPAA for \\"violence including grisly images of torture, nudity and language\\". =Box office= The film opened at number 5 at the US box office, grossing $5.7 million its opening weekend showing on 2,550 screens. It earned an additional $2.3 million the following weekend (September 6‚Äì8), and $982,450 the subsequent weekend (September 13‚Äì15). The film screened in US theaters until Halloween, though by the weekend of October 25, the number of screens it was showing on had reduced to 92 in total. The film's total domestic gross was $13.3 million, and $5.6 international, totaling $18.9 million worldwide. =Critical response= As of 2018, it holds a 3% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 101 reviews and has a weighted average of 2.65/10. The critics' consensus reads: \\"As frustrating as a 404 error, Fear Dot Com is a stylish, incoherent, and often nasty mess with few scares.\\" At Metacritic, the film holds a 16/100 rating based on 20 reviews, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Roger Ebert criticized the film for its lack of originality, specifically, and its overt violence. Mark Kermode of The Observer and Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters wrote of the premise's similarity to the Japanese film Kairo and David Cronenberg's Videodrome, as well as Hideo Nakata's Ringu. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \\"F\\" grade on an A+ to F scale; , it is one of only 19 films to receive such a rating. Empire magazine gave the film one out of five stars, calling it \\"arguably the least imaginative, most pathetic horror of the decade.\\" The Guardian called it a \\"nasty, badly acted horror film [...] like Marc Evans' My Little Eye or Olivier Assayas' execrable Demonlover, it manages to be both prurient and very, very naive about the internet.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, \\"strange, how good FeardotCom is, and how bad. The screenplay is a mess, and yet the visuals are so creative this is one of the rare bad films you might actually want to see\\" and praising the last 20 minutes as something which, if it \\"had been produced by a German impressionist in the 1920s, we'd be calling it a masterpiece.\\" He added, \\"The movie is extremely violent; it avoided the NC-17 rating and earned an R, I understand, after multiple trims and appeals, and even now it is one of the most graphic horror films I've seen.\\" Jami Bernard of The New York Daily News said, \\"The story is a mess, some of the images offensive, the acting under par and the dialogue silly.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today said, \\"Feardotcom is the cinematic equivalent of spam in your e-mail inbox.\\" Furthermore, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie. In other words, it's badder than bad,\\" while Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that it \\"is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense.\\" Writing for The Globe and Mail, Liam Lacey wrote of the film's potential for cult status, adding: \\"but the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase \\"fatal script error.\\"\\" Andrew Manning of Radio Free Entertainment stated, \\"Of all the trash I had to watch in 2002, the insipid FearDotCom easily ranks among the worst,\\" and Oz of eFilmCritic.com stated: \\"In a year that has given us some of the worst films of all time, this must surely rank as the worst -- and that's a hard thing to do opposite Master of Disguise.\\" In his book The Cinema Dreams Its Rivals: Media Fantasy Films from Radio to the Internet, film scholar Paul Young praised the film's dark cinematography, writing: > FearDotCom refuses to let CG penetrate its mise-en-sc√®ne... FearDotCom is > set in New York, but instead of providing digitized skylines and enhanced > locales to fudge the differences, FearDotCom simply plunges the city into > the dark... In effect, [it] manages to incarnate a sense of what film \\"was\\" > before CG, a sense it underscores by building its Monogram B-film > environment around the Internet.  Accolades  FeardotCom won \\"Worst Film\\" at the 2003 Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Awards and 'Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver' at 2003 Fantafestival.

The terms shell dwellers or shelldwellers, shell-breeding, or ostracophil are descriptive terms for cichlid fish that use the empty shells of aquatic snails as sites for breeding and shelter. The terms have no taxonomic basis, although most shell-dwelling cichlids are from Lake Tanganyikas lamprologine lineage.Loiselle PV. (1994) The Cichlid Aquarium, Voyageur Press, Many shell dwelling cichlids are popular with fishkeepings and are frequently kept in aquaria. Shell origins In Lake Tanganyika the shells inhabited are from the genus Neothauma, while shells used by Pseudotropheus lanisticola in Lake Malawi are from genus Lanistes.Konings A (2001) Malawi cichlids in their natural habitat Cichlid Press, USA. Shell-dwelling cichlids Around 24 species of lamprologine cichlids use abandoned shells for shelter and breeding in Lake Tanganyika. Most, however, are not obligate shell-breeding cichlids and will spawn in other caves or crevices. Types of shell dwellers There are several groups the shell dwellers can be placed into: *Colonial shell dwellers. Quite popular for their familial behavior, these fish are native to or, in some cases, create their own shellbeds, with piles of dense shells. Species include Neolamprologus multifasciatus, Neolamprologus similis and Neolamprologus callipterus *The ocellatus group has the most attractively patterned and many of the most aggressive of the shell-dwelling species, which share a similar body shape and territorial behavior. It has been said that if sharks behaved as this group does, the world's beaches would be abandoned. Species include Lamprologus ocellatus, Lamprologus stappersi, Lamprologus speciosus, and several species much more rare to the hobby. *The Lepidiolamprologus group, now considered Neolamprologus species. These are larger shell dwellers and some may prefer mud-dwelling in the wild. They include Neolamprologus boulengeri, Neolamprologus hecqui, Neolamprologus variostigma and Neolamprologus meeli. *The Altolamprologus varieties include Altolamprologus compressiceps \\"Sumbu\\" and other locational varieties that remain smaller than the normal A. compressiceps in order to use shells. *The genus Telmatochromis contains one definite shell dweller, Telmatochromis sp \\"temporalis shell,\\" and many species that will shell-dwell in captivity. *The brevis group contains a number of species with heavy bodies and gentle temperaments, including Neolamprologus brevis and Neolamprologus calliurus. *The signatus group contains slim, reflective species, including Neolamprologus signatus, Neolamprologus ornatippinnis and Neolamprologus kungweensis. *The Malawi shell dwellers, which may comprise several species but as yet only Pseudotropheus lanisticola is certain, one of the smallest mbuna in Lake Malawi at a bare 7 cm. Range Shell dwellers are found throughout Lake Tanganyika, along the coasts of Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Tanzania. Diet Shell dwellers are carnivores that primarily feed on zooplankton and other microscopic and near-microscopic foods. Cichlids' distinctive pharyngeal teeth, in the throat of the fish, are present in shell dwellers, though small. Armed with those and the usual teeth along with the typical dissolving qualities of water shell dwellers can eat a variety of foods in the wild and in captivity. Many species have been known to pull small snails from their shells to eat, to catch and devour the fry of other fish, and to go after small crustaceans. A shell-dwelling male Lamprologus stappersi displays his dominance. Reproduction As with other cichlids they protect their young, and the distinctive shell-dwelling provides them with a defensible nursery. Generally eggs are laid by the female within the shell and fertilized as she lays them or immediately after by the male. The female will protect the shell, fanning her pectoral fins to keep the internal water oxygenated, and often rearranging the substrate to create barriers or to hide the shell from predators. Eggs hatch within 48 hours, dependent primarily on temperature, and the yolk sac is absorbed within five days. Fry typically emerge from the shell a week after spawning, although they remain quite benthic for days or weeks after their emergence. Shell dwellers as aquarium fish The Malawi shell dweller, Pseudotropheus lanisticola, was first identified in 1964 along with many other mbuna in that lake, but the Tanganyikan shell dwellers were found primarily in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Altolamprologus compressiceps was identified in 1958 but the shell- dwelling varieties were found much later. The shell-dwelling species' needs are very similar. The basic aquarium setup and equipment are appropriate with a few changes. First, the substrate should be sand. Many of the species are very accomplished diggers and for security may bury all or part of a shell, use sand as a territorial barrier, or generally amuse the owner by spitting, sifting, or throwing it. Second, hard, alkaline water must be provided, which should also be kept free of ammonia and nitrites and with low nitrates. Finally, appropriate shells must be provided. Common shells used for shell dwellers include authentic Neothauma shells, ocean turbo shells, escargot shells, whale eye shells, and Ampullariidae-family shells. Shells must be of an appropriate size for the species, have a round opening, and have open coils. Numbers of shells will vary; for colonial species, hundreds may be ideal. For brevis types, a single shell per pair is often representative.

Roman Ghirshman (, Roman Mikhailovich Girshman; October 3, 1895 - 5 September 1979) was a Ukrainian-born French archeologist who specialized in ancient Persia. A native of Kharkiv in the Sloboda Ukraine (present-day Ukraine) Ghirshman moved to Paris in 1917 to study Archeology and Ancient Languages. He was mainly interested in the archeological ruins of Iran, specifically Teppe Gian, Teppe Sialk, Bagram in Afghanistan, Bishapur in Fars, and Susa. In the 1930s, Girshman, together with his wife Tania Ghirshman, was the first to excavate Teppe Sialk. His studies on Chogha Zanbil have been printed in 4 volumes, and he also led excavation teams at Kharg Island, Iwan-i Karkheh, and the Parthian platforms in Masjed Soleiman, near Izeh, Khuzestan. With 300 papers and 20 books published, Ghirshman was one of the most prolific and respected experts on ancient Iran. Some of his works on Susa have not even been published yet, but have served other archeologists such as Jean Perrot and Hermann Gasche in subsequent follow-up studies in the 1960s and 1970s in Iran.

He was known as a player of great technique, great vision, and lethal in the penalty area. Despite his reputation for drinking, smoking and not going to training, Moreno was also known for his formidable heading ability and fine physical qualities. Club career Moreno was born in the neighbourhood of La Boca, in Buenos Aires, and grew up in the surroundings of the club Boca Juniors' stadium, La Bombonera. At the age of 15, he tried out for the lower divisions of Boca Juniors, but did not make the selection. According to the Argentine Football Association archives, he said, frustrated: \\"some time you will regret it\\". Moreno then became part of the lower divisions of River Plate, Boca Junior's arch-rival, in 1933, having been recommended by Bernab√© Ferreyra, a notable forward for River Plate.

At the age of 18, Moreno was selected along with other young players from the club by manager Em√©rico Hirschl to make a tour in Brazil. His first competitive appearance was against Brazilian side Botafogo. He debuted in Primera Divisi√≥n on March 17, 1935, in a 2‚Äì1 win against C.A. Platense, scoring one goal. Quickly become the greatest figure of Argentine soccer, he was part of the squad that won league titles in 1936 and 1937, and went on to become a key player among Adolfo Pedernera on the River Plate squad known as La M√°quina, famous for his line of attack composed by Moreno, Pedernera, √Ångel Labruna, Juan Carlos Mu√±oz, and F√©lix Loustau, and which dominated Argentine football during the first half of the 1940s decade, winning with Moreno two national titles (1941, 1942) and many Aldao Cups. =Mexico (1944-1946)= In 1944, Moreno was transferred to M√©xico Primera Divisi√≥n club Espa√±a, who had finished runner up to Asturias, first Mexican league champions in the 1943‚Äì44 season. With Espa√±a, Moreno won the national title in the 1945‚Äì46 season. His time and success in Mexico earned him the nickname Charro, which is also the term used to refer to the traditional cowboy of Mexico. =Return to South America (1946-1961)= Moreno returned to his homeland and River Plate for the latter part of 1946. His second tenure at River lasted three seasons. Champion again in 1947, already with Alfredo Di St√©fano as center forward, he returned to emigrate after the strike of 1948 players. He was transferred to Universidad Cat√≥lica of Chile, where in the same year he helped the team win its first league title. He returned to Argentina in 1950, this time to play for Boca Juniors, and the following year, he played again for Universidad Cat√≥lica.

Moreno was a member of the Argentina national team from 1936 to 1950, earning 34 caps and scoring 19 goals. Moreno was part of the winning squads at the South American Championships (now Copa Am√©rica) of 1941, 1942 and 1947. He scored the tournament's milestone goal number 500 in an atypical match against Ecuador: he scored five goals in that match, a Copa Am√©rica record which he shares with H√©ctor Scarone (Uruguay), Juan Marvezzi (Argentina) and Evaristo (Brazil). That day, Argentina beat Ecuador 12‚Äì0, which is also the largest goal difference in a single Copa Am√©rica match. Moreno was the top goalscorer of the 1942 South American Championship with seven goals, along with Herminio Masantonio, and was chosen best player of the 1947 edition. He is also tied for third place among the Copa Am√©rica's all-time top scorers, with 13 overall goals. Managerial career Moreno had a brief spell as manager of Argentina in 1959.

It is one of the most photographed peaks in the country and the highest mountain in the world to emerge directly from the sea floor. Etymology The distinctive shape of the peak in southern New Zealand gives the mountain its name, after the mitre headwear of Christian bishops. It was named by Captain John Lort Stokes of HMS Acheron. The MƒÅori name for the peak is Rahotu. Geography Part of the reason for its iconic status is its location. Close to the shore of Milford Sound, in the Fiordland National Park in the southwestern South Island, it is a stunning sight. The mountain rises near vertically to , i.e. just over a mile, from the water of Milford Sound, which technically is a fjord. The peak is actually a closely grouped set of five peaks, with Mitre Peak not even the tallest one, however from most easily accessible viewpoints, Mitre Peak appears as a single point. Milford Sound is part of Te Wahipounamu, a World Heritage Site as declared by UNESCO. The only road access to Milford Sound is via State Highway 94, in itself one of the most scenic roads in New Zealand. Climbing Mitre Peak is difficult to reach and as a result ascent attempts are relatively infrequent. The first known attempt of the peak was in 1883 by Invercargill artist Samuel Mereton, and Donald Sutherland. The pair took a boat to Sinbad Bay on 6 February and camped at the head of the valley. The next day with little equipment, no coats and one biscuit each they climbed to the crest of the Mitre Range, from where they could see Mitre Peak over 3 km away to the east. With it being too late in the day to descend, they were forced to sleep where they were overnight, before the next day abandoning the attempt to avoid an approaching storm. After a difficult descent they were forced to sit out two more days in bad weather at the head of Sinbad Gully before rowing back across Milford Sound to the hotel operated by Sunderland's wife. In 1911, Jim Dennistoun walked in to Milford Sound from Lake Te Anau over Mackinnon Pass, and inquired among the track porters in the hope of finding someone to climb the peak with him. None of the porters had any climbing experience, but one of them, Joe Beaglehole (1875‚Äì1962), had read Scrambles among the Alps by noted climber Edward Whymper and was thus chosen by Dennistoun to accompany him. During a sea voyage in the area with brother George in HMS Pioneer in 1909 Dennistoun had identified what he thought was a possible route but as he wasn't able to reconnoitre it he instead decided to take a route recommended by Donald Sutherland. After rowing across in a boat to the mouth of Sinbad Gully at the base of the peak they starting climbing at 7.30am on 13 March 1911. Dennistoun and Beaglehole climbed via the south east-ridge through the bush until 300 metres short of the summit Beaglehole decided it was too difficult to continue and stopped. Dennistoun continued on alone up steep, smooth slabs of granite, to reach the summit at 1.15pm.Hall-Jones, page 167. Descending back down Dennistoun rejoined Beaglehole and they continued with the descent. Unfortunately to avoid climbing back over the Footstool, they decided to descend straight into Sinbad Gully, which meant they had to resort to using a rope to lower themselves down bluffs. They eventually reached the valley floor in darkness, and it soon commenced to rain. With no camping equipment, they had no choice but to continue on until they reached the boat at 9.45pm, cold, wet and exhausted. They then rowed back across to spend the night at the hotel operated by Elizabeth Sunderland. Dennistoun's claim to have reached the top was disputed by Donald Sutherland who had bluntly claimed that Mitre Peak could not be climbed. In 1914 Dennistoun's handkerchief was found in a small cairn on the top of the peak by Jack Murrell (1886‚Äì1918) and Edger Williams (1891‚Äì1983) when they completed the second ascent of the peak.Ede, page 26. When J.H. Christie and G. Raymond completed the third ascent in 1941 they found remains of the handkerchief, as well as two halfpennies left by Murrell and Williams. =Climbing routes= There are six routes up to Mitre Peak, and most climbers start by getting a boat to Sinbad Bay.

T. deformans is found in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.Gray, William D.. The Relation of Fungi to Human Affairs. New York: Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1959. Print. Peach leaf curl reduces the amount of leaves and fruit produced by peach and nectarine trees.Chester, Kenneth Starr. Nature and Prevention of Plant Diseases. 2nd. Philadelphia: The Blakiston Company, 1947. Print.  Affected species  Peach leaf curl can mainly affect peach, nectarine, and to a lesser extent almond trees. In an isolated case in Hungary in 2011, peach leaf curl was also identified in apricot trees.Kovics, Gyorgi Janos. An unusual occurrence of Taphrina deformans on apricot trees in Hungary. University of Debrecen, Oct 2011.  Symptoms  Peach leaf curl is a distinctive and easily noticeable fungal disease, and the severity of the symptoms depends on how early infection has occurred. Diseased leaves can usually be identified soon after they emerge from the bud, due to their red color and twisted shape. As the leaves develop, they become increasingly distorted, and ultimately thick and rubbery compared to normal leaves. The color of the leaves changes from the normal green to red and purple, until a whitish bloom covers each leaf. Finally, the dead leaf may dry and turn black before it is cast off. Changes in the bark are less noticeable, if at all. Fruit may fail to develop from diseased blossoms. Any fruit that does develop from a diseased tree is usually normal, but sometimes may also be affected, showing a reddish color. Infected leaves fall early. The tree usually produces a second flush of leaves that is rarely diseased, except in an unseasonably cool and wet spring, because the fungus is not infectious at the normally higher temperatures in late spring and early summer.  Cause of peach leaf curl  The fungus T. deformans causes deformed young leaves, red blisters, and ultimately the whitish bloom that covers the leaf as the infection progresses. This white color is made of asci that break through the cuticle of the leaf. One ascus consists of eight ascospores that create conidia, which are ejected in early summer and spread by rain and wind. The fungus survives the winter on the surface of the host plant, such as on bark or buds. In late winter or early spring, rainwater washes spores into the buds as they burst. Once this happens, no treatment is effective. In the spring, about two weeks after blossom, new leaves emerging from the infected buds are infected by the conidia. The disease may not occur every year due to variation in temperature and rainfall. Specifically, for successful infection, the fungus requires wet winters, where rain (not fog or dew) wets the tree for more than 12.5 hours at temperatures below .Rossi, V. et al. (2006). Influence of Environmental Conditions on Infection of Peach Shoots by Taphrina deformans. Phytopathology 96:155-163. The fungus cannot grow at temperatures below .  Control of the disease  Various methods are applied. *The most effective methodRoyal Horticultural Society. Peach Leaf Curl. is to plant peach trees against a house wall under an overhanging roof, possibly covered by a mat during the winter, to keep winter rain from the buds before they burst (and incidentally to delay blossoming until spring frosts are over), until the temperature exceeds in the spring, deactivating the fungus. *Commercially, spraying the leaves with fungicides is the most common control method. The toxicity of these fungicides means they are not legally available to noncommercial growers in some countries. Spraying should be done in the winter well before budding. If trees are not sprayed early enough, treatment is ineffective. Copper-based mixtures (such as Bordeaux mixture) and lime sulphur are two fungicides commonly used.. *Peach cultivars can be planted which show some resistance to peach leaf curl, or at least regenerate rapidly, such as the white-fleshed Peach 'Benedicte'.LWG [Bavarian State Institute for Viticulture and Horticulture]. Field trials on peach and nectarine trees regarding peach leaf curl.<> For nectarines, the cultivar Kreibich is reported to have some resistance. If a tree has peach leaf curl in a particular year, the disease will inexorably take its course, but measures can be taken to sustain the tree or maximize crop yield: protecting the tree from further rain at temperatures below , providing nitrogen and excess water to minimize stress on the tree; applying greasebands around the trunk to protect from insect infestation; and thinning the fruit. It is unclear whether removal of infected leaves from the tree is beneficial.University of California (2012) Integrated Pest Management Program - Peach leaf Curl. Removing the infected leaves and fruit after they fall to the ground is sometimes also suggested but superfluous if, in the following winter, fungicides or rain protection are applied.  History  Peach leaf curl was first introduced in America in 1852 and has now spread all over the country. By 1947, the disease was costing the United States $2.5 to 3.0 million annually.

He also had two brothers, 12 Earthquake ‚ÄúBloody Jaguar‚Äù and 9 Flower ‚ÄúCopalball with Arrow‚Äù who were both faithful war companions of 8 Deer. He also had a half-sister 6 Lizard ‚ÄúJade- Fan‚Äù. First the fiancee and lover of 8 Deer himself, she was finally married to 8 Deer's archenemy 11 Wind ‚ÄúBloody Jaguar‚Äù, the king of the city \\"Xipe's Bundle\\", also known as Red and White Bundle. The lords of Xipe's Bundle had rights to the throne of Tilantongo and were therefore the most important rivals to 8 Deer's power. Codex Zouche-Nuttall, Mixtec pictorial codex which is the main source of knowledge about Eight Deer Jaguar Claw. Lord 8 Deer is remembered for his military expansion. The Codex Zouche-Nuttall counts 94 cities conquered during his reign. Almost always pictured wearing a jaguar helmet, he supported the powerful Toltec ruler of Cholula, Lord 4 Jaguar ‚ÄúFace of the Night‚Äù in his attempts at expansionism, and was thus awarded a turquoise nose ornament, a symbol of Toltec royal authority.Pohl (n.d.) The Codices also tell of his several marriages which seem to have been part of a political strategy to achieve dominance by marrying into different Mixtec royal lineages. He married 13 Serpent, daughter of his own stepsister and former fiancee of 6 Lizard. In 1101 8 Deer finally conquered Xipe's Bundle, killed his wife's father and his stepsister's husband 11 Wind and tortured and killed his brothers-in-law, except the youngest one by the name of 4 Wind. In 1115 4 Wind led an alliance between different Mixtec kingdoms against 8 Deer who was taken prisoner and sacrificed by 4 Wind, his own nephew and brother- in-law. Legacy 8 Deer was the only Mixtec king ever to unite kingdoms of the three Mixtec areas: Tilantongo in the Mixteca Alta area with Teozacualco of the Mixteca Baja area and Tututepec of the coastal Mixteca area. His reputation as a great ruler has given him a legendary status among the Mixtecs; some aspects of his life story as it is told in the pictographic codices seem to merge with myth. Furthermore, actual knowledge of his life is hindered by the lack of complete understanding of the Mixtec codices, and although the study of the codices has advanced much over the past 20 years, it is still difficult to achieve a definitive interpretation of their narrative. The narrative, as it is currently understood, is a tragic story of a man who achieves greatness but falls victim to his own hunger for power. The above biography of 8 Deer is based on the Codex's interpretation by Mixtec specialist John Pohl.See Pohl (2002); Byland and Pohl (1994) Notes References   Category:1115 deaths Category:Mixtec people Category:1063 births Category:Medieval kings Category:Indigenous military personnel of the Americas Category:Executed military leaders Category:Executed monarchs Category:11th-century monarchs in North America ","title":"Eight Deer Jaguar Claw"},{"id":"2134698","title":"Southwest Oregon Regional Airport"},{"id":"2134702","text":"Joanna ≈ªubr (ca. 1770‚Äì1852) was a Polish soldier of the Napoleonic Wars, a veteran of the Polish‚ÄìAustrian War, and the first woman to receive the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military decoration. After the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars and creation of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1808, Joanna ≈ªubr with her husband, Micha≈Ç, left Austrian-ruled Volhynia. Both joined the army of the new Duchy, with Joanna initially a camp-follower. Soon she enlisted in the 2nd Infantry Regiment (4th company, 2nd battalion) as a private, hiding that she was a woman from both her superiors and fellow soldiers. In 1809, Joanna took part in the Galician Campaign, distinguishing herself in the Battle of Zamo≈õƒá on May 19 of that year. For her bravery, Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski awarded her the medal of Virtuti Militari; Joanna was the first female soldier to be awarded the decoration and one of the first women in the world to receive a military award for bravery in battle. After the campaign, she joined the 17th Infantry Regiment in DƒÖbrowski's Division, under Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski. Her husband was an ensign in the same regiment and Joanna ≈ªubr was promoted to sergeant, as the first woman in the Polish Army. Their division, renamed the Greater Polish Division, took part in Napoleon's invasion of Russia and his campaign in present-day Belarus. During the battles and Napoleon's retreat, she was separated from her division, but she managed to escape from Russia on her own. In the summer of 1813, weeks after Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski's forces had abandoned Krak√≥w, she reached Polish units in Saxony and served with distinction until the signing of the Treaty of Fontainebleau and the end of the war. Joanna and her husband returned to Poland. Because she could return to neither Austrian-occupied nor Russian-held parts of Poland, they settled at Wielu≈Ñ. She died there during a cholera epidemic in 1852, at the age of about eighty. Sources * Encyklopedia Wojen Napoleo≈Ñskich ‚Äì R.

It is used by general aviation, military aviation and a few airline flights. In 2013 the Airport changed its name to Crater Lake-Klamath Regional Airport. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015 categorized it as a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings (enplanements) per year. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 15,856 enplanements in 2011, a decrease from 21,353 in 2010. As Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base, the airport is the home of the Oregon Air National Guard's 173d Fighter Wing (173 FW) flying the F-15 Eagle. An Air Education and Training Command (AETC)-gained unit, the 173 FW specializes as an advanced air-to-air combat training center for Regular Air Force and Air National Guard F-15 pilots, as well as hosting joint and combined air combat exercises for all US military services and those of Canada. Kingsley Field is home to a USAF flight surgeon training school. The 173d Fighter Wing is currently under the command of Colonel Jeff Smith. History In 1928 the citizens of Klamath Falls approved the sale of $50,000 worth of bonds to build Klamath Falls Municipal Airport. It had gravel runways and one Fixed-Base Operator; in 1942 it was selected for a Naval Air Station later named NAS Klamath Falls. In 1945 the airport transferred back to civil use; the January 1952 C&GS; diagram shows runway 7 (5258 ft long), 14 (7134 ft) and 18 (5164 ft). In 1954 the airport was selected as a site for U.S. Air Force installation under a joint civil-military arrangement supporting Air Defense Command, later Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) aircraft and squadrons. In 1957 the airport was dedicated as Kingsley Field in honor of 2nd Lieutenant David R. Kingsley, USAAF, an Oregonian killed in action on June 23, 1944 after a B-17 bombing mission over the oil fields of Ploesti, Rumania. In 1976 ADC was inactivated and control of the military installation passed to Tactical Air Command (TAC). In 1978 the Department of Defense closed Kingsley Field as a regular Air Force installation, transferring all military facilities to the Air National Guard.Kingsley Field (ANG) Facilities Crater Lake - Klamath Regional Airport covers 1,166 acres (472 ha) at an elevation of 4,095 feet (1,248 m). It has two runways: 14/32 is 10,301 by 150 feet (3,140 x 46 m) asphalt and concrete; 7/25 is 5,258 by 100 feet (1,603 x 30 m) asphalt. In 2011 the airport had 39,004 aircraft operations, average 106 per day: 43% general aviation, 41% military, 14% air taxi, and 2% airline. 170 aircraft were then based at the airport: 62% single-engine, 19% jet, 15% military, 3% multi-engine, and 1% helicopter. Airline history Until 1959 United Airlines Douglas DC-3s and Convair 340s served Klamath Falls; later West Coast Airlines flew Fairchild F-27s to cities in Oregon and California. West Coast merged with Bonanza Air Lines and Pacific Air Lines to form Air West which changed its name to Hughes Airwest and merged into Republic Airlines. Air West and Hughes Airwest continued to serve the airport with F-27s. Hughes Airwest introduced the first jets, Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s; successor Republic DC-9s continued to serve the airport until 1983. In the late 1970s - early 1980s Air Oregon Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners flew direct to Portland, Seattle and other cities. In the mid 1980s Pacific Express BAC One-Elevens flew to San Francisco via Redding, California and to Portland via Redmond. Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska Airlines, flew de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8s to Portland and Seattle. WestAir (United Express) flew BAe Jetstream 31s to San Francisco while Reno Air Express (Mid Pacific Air for Reno Air) flew BAe Jetstream 31s to San Jose, California. United Express (SkyWest Airlines) pulled out of Klamath Falls in the late 1990s but resumed flights when Horizon Air quit the airport. SkyWest (United Express) Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias were the last airliners at Klamath Falls. In late 2010 SkyWest dropped one flight to Portland. Passenger count dropped in 2011, but passengers per flight increased.Cith of Klamath Falls Annual Report 2011, page 6. United Express, operated by SkyWest, terminated service to Portland and San Francisco on June 5, 2014. PenAir started Saab 340B flights from Klamath Falls to Portland on October 6, 2016. Initially, the proposed service by PenAir was on hold from 2015 due to federal Transportation Security Administration (TSA) refusal to station security personnel at the terminal. As of August 2017, this service has ended, following PenAir filing for bankruptcy. Airlines and destinations =Cargo= Funding The Airport City Fund operates the airport's civilian and military interest. Revenue mainly is from city property taxes, transient room taxes and the rental activities in the airport itself. Because of the commercial flights at the airport, the Federal Aviation Administration contributes funds to keep the runways and taxiways in good conditions.

They all represented Eton in the Eton v Harrow annual needle match and represented Cambridge at cricket. These three brothers dominated the Cambridge cricket scene in the early 1880s. Kynaston, George and CT were still at Eton when their father, Edward Studd, became a born-again Christian and they were far from pleased by his efforts to interest them in the gospel. However, all three themselves converted when a visiting preacher went to stay with the Studd family during the summer holidays of 1878, an event that was to have a profound influence on the rest of their lives. The three boys were the oldest sons of their father's second wife, Dora Sophia n√©e Thomas, and were brought up at Spratton Hall in Northamptonshire, Hallaton Hall in Leicestershire, and Tedworth House in Wiltshire. The family also had a residence in Hyde Park Gardens. They excelled at cricket initially at Cheam School, then at Eton, and later at Trinity College, Cambridge, where the brothers achieved a remarkable record of each captaining the university cricket team in successive seasons from 1882 to 1884. The exceptional skills shown by CT gained him a place in the England team in 1882 which lost the match to Australia which originated the tradition of \\"the Ashes\\" between the two countries. The following winter he toured Australia with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team who recovered the trophy. Their father Edward Studd, who had 11 children in all, was born in Bombay and made his fortune in indigo manufacture. The famous Ashes The Ashes urn Charles played in the original test against Australia, where the Ashes were first named, and was one of the last two batsman in. The match was low scoring and had been affected by recent rain. Australia batted first and scored 63; England only managed 101 in reply. In their second innings the Australians scored 122, so on the second day, England needed only 85 to win. When England's last batsman went in the team needed only 10 runs to win, but the final batsman Edmund Peate scored only 2 before being bowled by Boyle. The astonished crowd fell silent, not believing that England could possibly have lost by 7 runs. When what had happened had sunk in, the crowd cheered the Australians. When Peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by the captain WG Grace for not allowing his partner at the wicket, CT Studd, to get the runs. Despite Studd being one of the best batsman in England, Peate replied, \\"I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best.\\" By now the damage was done and The Sporting Times next headlined with the following famous phrase: Longer-lasting fame continues for the brothers in the form of the inscription on the Ashes' urn, which reads: Studd family Articles relating to the famous three brothers: * *Kynaston Studd *George Studd =The minor brothers= Four more Studd brothers were competent cricketers, and all played for MCC, but did not rise to the fame of their siblings: *Edward John Charles Studd :Born 13 February 1849, Tirhoot, India :Died 1 March 1909, Folkestone, Kent, England :Cricket teams: Eton, Cheltenham (1866), MCC :Cricket record *Reginald Augustus Studd :Born 18 December 1873, Tedworth House, Wiltshire :Died 3 February 1948, Northampton :Cricket teams: Eton, Blue at Cambridge in 1895, Hampshire, MCC :Cricket record *Arthur Haythorne Studd, known as a painter and art collector :Born 19 November 1863, Hallaton Hall, Hallaton, Leicestershire :Died 26 January 1919, Marylebone, London :Cricket teams: Eton, MCC :Cricket record *Herbert William Studd, army officer :Born 26 December 1870, Tedworth House, Wiltshire :Died 8 August 1947, Bayswater, London :Cricket teams: Eton, Middlesex, MCC, Hampshire :Cricket record A great-nephew Peter was also a notable cricketer, and Lord Mayor of London in 1970.

It was introduced in 1997, updated in 1998, and then discontinued. It was an OEM BEV variant of Chevrolet's S-10 pickup truck. The S-10 Electric was solely powered by electricity, and was marketed primarily to utility fleet customers. Design General Motors started with a regular-cab, short-box ( bed) S-10 pickup, with a base-level trim package plus a half-tonneau cover. In place of a typical inline four cylinder or V-6 internal combustion engine, the Electric S-10 EV was equipped with an three-phase, liquid-cooled AC induction motor, based on GM's EV1 electric coupe. The EV1 had a 100 kW motor; GM reduced the S-10EV's motor because of the additional weight and drag of the truck so as not to overstress the batteries. Other than the reduced motor size, most of the EV1 power electronics were carried over directly to the S-10 EV, which mandated that the Electric S-10 use a front-wheel-drive configuration, unlike the rear-wheel-drive setup of the standard S-10, and in the competing Ford Ranger EV. =Batteries= Similar to the Gen 1 EV1's, there were lead acid battery and nickel‚Äìmetal hydride battery options. The 1997 Chevrolet S-10 EV used a lead acid battery pack. Manufactured by Delco Electronics, the battery pack consisted of 27 cells, with one being designated as an \\"auxiliary\\" cell. These reportedly offered 16.2 kilowatt-hours for propulsion. In 1998, an Ovonic nickel‚Äìmetal hydride battery (NiMH) pack was also available; these batteries were lighter () and had a combined 29 kilowatt-hours of storage for a longer range. NiMH also has longer life but costs more than the lead acid option. The battery pack was located between the frame rails, beneath the pickup bed. On all battery types, a passive battery monitoring and management system was used; this meant that excess energy was wasted from cells with a higher charge, while the remainder of the cells reach the same state of charge. =Charging= The S-10 EV charges using the Magne Charger, produced by the General Motors subsidiary Delco Electronics. The inductive charging paddle is the model J1773 or the 'large' paddle. The small paddle can also be used with an adapter to properly seat it. The standard charger is a 220 V 30 A (6.6 kW); there is also a 110 V 15 A 'convenience' charger, and a high-power fast-charge version. The vehicle's charging port is accessed by flipping the front license plate frame downwards. The system is designed to be safe even when used in the rain. Efficiency Depending on the load and driving conditions the range can vary greatly: For the 1997 model with lead-acid battery pack, city range was ; the mixed city/highway range was ; the highway range was if operating constantly at or less. The acceleration time (0 to 50 mph) was listed as 13.5 seconds (at 50 percent battery charge - the published literature stated that acceleration time was \\"even less\\" when the truck had a full charge). Like the EV1, the top speed of the S-10 EV was governed, albeit to , less than its coupe sibling. The performance is much better for the 1998 model year with the nickel‚Äìmetal hydride battery, at an approximately range and an acceleration time of 10.9 seconds at 50% charge. *1997 MY GM S10 EV lead acid: 29.2 kWh/100 miles *1998 MY GM S10 EV lead acid: 45 kWh/100 miles (city driving), and 41 kWh/100 miles (highway driving, with maximum speed 45 mph or less). *1998 MY GM S10 EV NiMH: 94 kWh/100 miles (city driving), and 86 kWh/100 miles (highway driving, with maximum speed 45 mph or less).Model Year 1999 EPA Fuel Economy Guide Note: 1998 GM S10 EV NiMh numbers above are apparently wrong. This page lists the NiMH S10 with a 29-kilowatt-hour battery and range of (EPA) which corresponds to 40.3 kWh/100 miles (403 Wh/mile). This corresponds to the NiMH version of the vehicle having a lighter battery pack than the lead-acid model. *1997 MY GM S10 EV lead acid: 292 Wh/mile (J1634) *1998 MY GM S10 EV NiMH: 276 Wh/mile (J1634) 1998 updates While the standard S-10 moved to a redesigned front fascia in 1998, the S-10 Electric kept the same front fascia as the '94-'97, with the exception of composite headlamps in 1998 versus the previous year's sealed- beam headlamps. The interior was also updated in 1998 along with internal combustion models, adding a passenger side airbag. Aside from this header panel, a unique lower bumper valance, and a stylized 'Electric' decal on the bottom of the doors, there is little difference externally between the appearance of an Electric and a stock S-10. Any changes, however minimal, were reported to have had a positive influence on reducing the truck's aerodynamic resistance. These changes included a closed grille and a front air skirt, belly pans beneath the front suspension, a seal between the cab and the pickup bed, and a half-length tonneau cover over the rear of the pickup bed. Instruments Internally, the instrument cluster was exclusive to the Electric S-10, and featured only four gauges - a speedometer, a large \\"charge\\" gauge which reads from 'E' to 'F' like a fuel gauge, a voltmeter ranging from 220 to 440 volts, and a \\"power use\\" meter, which acts as an ammeter of sorts showing discharge during acceleration and charge during regenerative braking. The LCD display for the shifter was shortened to display only park, neutral, reverse, and drive, since the S-10 EV does not have the usual transmission. Additional features Although the S-10 EV was developed from a \\"base\\" trim package, the Electric S-10 still came standard with dual airbags in 1998, a heat pump for both air conditioning and heating, power four-wheel ABS brakes, regenerative braking, power steering, AM/FM radio, and daytime running lamps, among other items. For colder climates, a fuel-fired heater was standard, which runs on diesel fuel from a tank. The heater will operate when ambient temperature falls below . Because battery performance varies greatly with temperature, the heat pump supplies cooling to the batteries during charging when necessary. Passive air recirculation is used during the driving cycle to equalize variations in battery temperature. The heat pump can be activated during the driving cycle under extreme battery over-temperature conditions over , typically as a result of extreme battery discharge. Sales Unlike the EV1, of the 492 S-10EVs assembled about 60 were sold to fleet customers, rather than just leased through restrictive programs, mostly due to the prior Department of Transportation crashworthiness evaluations done on stock S-10 pickups. As a result, a few Electric S-10s can still be found in use today. The fleet life of many of these ended in 2007 and 2008. The vehicles (around 440) that were not sold were eventually scrapped, similar to the fate of their EV1 siblings. Recent uses In 2004 GM converted an S-10 EV to rear-wheel drive, using prototype in-wheel electric motors instead of an under-hood motor.

At Eton, Kynaston was never on the losing side in the needle matches against Harrow and Winchester. In 1879 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge,STUDD, Sir (John Edward) Kynaston, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2016 (online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014, accessed 12 Nov 2016) and was four years in the XI without ever excelling in the annual University match; things moved on in 1882 when he and his brothers took an important role in defeating by six wickets the great Australian side (which later in the season beat England at Kennington Oval) by seven runs. In the match, Kynaston scored 6 and 66, G B. 42 and 48, C. T. 118 and 17 not out; when Cambridge batted a second time requiring 165 runs for victory, the two elder brothers put up 106. =Olympics= Studd (center) at the 1908 Olympics in London With the 1908 London Games being the first true Summer Olympics to feature a parade of nations, Studd can be said to be the first person to carry the flag for Great Britain at an Olympic event. However, cricket was only played at the 1900 Olympic Games and Studd was therefore not a competitor.Williamson, Martin (9 August 2008). The ignorant Olympians. Cricinfo. ESPN. Accessed 26 October 2011.Great Britain. sports-reference.com University and beyond While still at university, Kynaston was president of Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union and was involved in helping his brother Charles set up and become one of the famous Cambridge Seven missionaries to China. After leaving Cambridge, where he was a member of the Pitt Club, Kynaston played occasionally for Middlesex, but spent most of his time on business and at the Royal Polytechnic Institute where he was President from 1903 until his death. He was awarded the OBE in the 1919 New Year Honours. After serving as Sheriff of London for 1922‚Äì23, he was knighted in 1923 and became Lord Mayor of London for 1928‚Äì29. He was created Baronet at the end of his official year. While President of MCC in September 1930 he gave a banquet at Merchant Taylors' Hall to the Australian team captained by W. M. Woodfull. His great-nephew Sir Peter Malden Studd was also Lord Mayor of London, from 1970 to 1972.  Legacy  Canon F. H. Gillingham, the former Dulwich College and Essex batsman, in his address at the Studd's memorial service in St. Paul's Cathedral said that after coming down from Cambridge, Kynaston realised that games were only a preparation for sterner duties, and in his presence it was easier for men to be good and harder to be bad. \\"Everything he touched he lifted up.\\" The Studd Trophy for athletic achievement at the Royal Polytechnic Institution is named for him.

Located on the edge of Gastown (207 West Hastings St), it was Vancouver's first steel-framed high- rise. At 53 m (175 ft), the thirteen-storey, Second Empire style building was the tallest commercial building in the British Empire upon its completion in 1910.City of Vancouver's plaque on the building, photo visible here Its architect was John S. Helyer,Helyer was in partnership with his son, Maurice, as J.S. Helyer & Son (Blue Plaque; the firm also erected the building housing the Vancouver Stock exchange at 148 West Hastings Street (1908) (now \\"Regal Place\\"), the ten-storey Metropolitan Building on Hastings Street (1911-12), and the Board of Trade building at Homer and Cordova, (1909), using poured-in- place concrete; Maurice Helyer built the Medial Arts Building on Granville Street (1922-23), according to Au Petit Chavignol in another Maurice Helyer building, at 845 East Hastings. who is said to have died after falling off the staircase in the front of the building, though this is an urban legend.Emporis Building Database The financiers of the structure were the Counts von Alvensleben from Germany, who were active in Vancouver's financial scene at the time. It was generally held at the time that they were a front for the Kaiser's money, which carried the suggestion that the Empire's tallest building had been built by its greatest rival. Today it is a provincially designated Class \\"A\\" heritage structure. Owned by Newton Investments Limited, it was restored by restoration expert Read Jones Christofferson. The building's current tenants include a film production company (Haddock), a law firm, clothing designers, record labels, antiquarian booksellers, Kokoro Dance, professional web developers, marketing agency, Bowery Creative, the office of the Green Party of Vancouver, a dentist, non-profit organizations such as Living Oceans Society and Fair Trade Vancouver, an artist's supply store, Opus, and a Lebanese restaurant, Nuba. The Dominion Building sits across the street from Victory Square, site of the former provincial courthouse, which was relocated to Georgia Street in 1913. The Dominion Building was at the hub of the city's financial and legal district until that move. The backside of the building (containing the emergency staircases) and Cambie Street was filmed during the street scenes of The Neverending Story. It can be seen from Water Street. The Dominion Building, as well as other elements of Victory Square, were filmed for scenes in an abandoned city in Battlestar Galactica. The initial rooftop chase scene from Blade: Trinity was shot at the Dominion building. The 2012 TV show Alcatraz also used this as a location in the opening episode, although the program was set in San Francisco, a lot of the location work was done in Vancouver. The Dominion building can also be seen in the background later in the series when a landmine is found in Victory Square. Can Lit. author Timothy Taylor. maintains a writing office in this building.

The official name being Raideen the Brave, it is mainly known as \\"Brave Raideen\\" or \\"Heroic Raydeen\\". A series called was broadcast from 1996 to 1997 on TV Tokyo, and another series called Reideen was broadcast in 2007 on WOWOW. Story After a slumber of twelve millennia, the Demon Empire awakens to seize control of the Earth. Raideen, the giant robot- like protector of the lost continent of Mu, senses the evil presence and awakens within its golden pyramid. A young Japanese boy, Akira Hibiki, is alerted about the Demon Empire by a mysterious voice and rushes to the pyramid. It is soon revealed that Akira is a descendant of the ancient people of Mu who must help Raideen save the Earth. Akira enters the robot by accelerating his motorcycle to a high speed and then throws himself upward, allowing a beam from the robot to pull him into the robot's head and into an internal cockpit from where he assumes control of Raideen. Akira is aided by Mari Sakurano, who happens to be the daughter of a prominent scientist, and his friends from the soccer club. Half way through the story the Demon Empire's master, Barao, is released from his statue prison and intends to finish what he started twelve thousand years earlier.

Extremely powerful purple sonic rings are launched from those satellite dishes, to entrap enemies and tear them apart at a molecular level. However, this attack has heavy repercussions to its pilot, Akira.

If Kibango's origin in episode 24 indicates anything during these events it is that Barao had successfully kept at war with the Mu for at least two thousand years. Eventually the Mu managed to use the Star of Ra Mu to defeat Barao by imprisoning him in a statue until the events of the series and created Raideen to slay any future members of the Demon Empire that would eventually return; however, Raideen would require the control of someone half Mu and half human in order to operate to handle its power. Upon reawakening from his statue prison, Barao had lost his memories of Ra Mu, but still managed to recollect memories of his empire and those who served him.

Raideen is also historically noteworthy for being one of the first transforming giant robots (Goldar, from Ambassador Magma, was an earlier character, although Goldar's transformation from robot to rocket ship was not a detailed mechanical transformation). The diecast toy version of Raideen, released in Japan in 1975 by Popy, was the first true transforming robot toy. Brave Raideen was the first anime mecha work of anime director and writer Yoshiyuki Tomino, better known as the creator of Gundam. The latter half was directed by Tadao Nagahama, and may be seen as a predecessor to his famous Romantic Trilogy, consisting of Combattler V, Voltes V and Daimos. *This series was the second collaboration between writer/director Yoshiyuki Tomino and artist Yasuhiko Yoshikazu. The first work to feature both men was Wandering Sun (Sasurai no Taiy≈ç) (1971). The two would later team up again for both Mobile Suit Gundam and Gundam F-91. *\\"Raideen\\" was named after the sumo wrestler \\"Raiden Tameemon\\". *According to RahXephon director Yutaka Izubuchi, the similarity of designs and powers of the title robots and the basic plots of RahXephon and Raideen are intentional. A low-budget Korean movie called Space Thunder Kids features a robot whose design appears to be a copy of Raideen's. Episodes *01. Gante, The Giant Dragon (Â§ßÈ≠îÁ´ú„Ç¨„É≥„ÉÜ) *02.

Raideen Immortal Remakes =Raideen the Superior= A 38 episode remake aired as Raideen the Superior (Ë∂ÖËÄÖ„É©„Ç§„Éá„Ç£„Éº„É≥; Ch≈çja Raidƒ´n) in 1996. This series was directed by Toshifumi Kawase. Five seemingly ordinary teenagers are actually superheroes called \\"Raideens\\" and their mission is to fight their enemy the so-called \\"Super Devils.\\" This series was notably different than the original, more akin to a Super Sentai series or Tekkaman Blade than the original Raideen and was designed to attract a female audience akin to Gundam Wing, Samurai Troopers and Dagwon. =Reideen= On January 2007, a twenty-six episode series, simply titled Reideen („É©„Ç§„Éá„Ç£„Éº„É≥; Raidƒ´n), produced this time by Production I.G., began transmission. In this remake, Saiga Junki, a high school student with a gift in mathematics, learns that his archaeologist father, who disappeared years earlier, has died. When going to claim his remains at a pyramid dubbed \\"Japan's Pyramid,\\" a meteor falls from the sky containing an evil life-form that seeks total destruction. Just as Saiga is put in danger by this life-form, the bracelet that his father left him reacts to the pyramid, and the titular robot is activated. It is now up to Saiga and Reideen to defend the Earth against the mysterious invaders. International Release Brave Raideen is considered the first super robot anime to reach a large U.S. audience directly. It was first broadcast in Honolulu, Hawaii on KIKU TV-13, which ran the series with English subtitles created and produced in-house. The series first hit the mainland in March 1976, Friday nights at 6:00 P.M. on Los Angeles's KWHY TV-22 and at 8:00 P.M. on San Francisco's KEMO TV-20. Later in 1976, Brave Raideen began running on KMUV TV-31 in Sacramento, California (Sunday nights; timeslot to be confirmed), as part of the station's Japanese-American programming. The series also aired similarly in Chicago (station and dates to be confirmed), as well as broadcast as part of the Japanese programming on New York City's WNJU TV-47.Clements, Jonathan. McCarthy Helen. [2006] (2006). The Anime Encyclopedia: Revised & Expanded Edition. Berkeley, CA: Stone Bridge Press. The Stateside push was sponsored by Honolulu/Los Angeles-based Marukai Trading Co., Ltd., who distributed a large line of Japanese-produced merchandise (as well as some Hawaii-produced items, such as tee-shirts) to local retailers in localities airing Brave Raideen‚Äîincluding Popy's Jumbo Machinder (which may account for Mattel's launching of the popular Shogun Warriors line in the U.S.), according to author August Ragone. Merchandise The original toy figures of Raideen (spelled \\"Raydeen\\") were introduced to the mainstream U.S. market as part of the Shogun Warriors toyline during the late 1970s under the Mattel brand, as well as the Marvel Comics book based on said toyline. Cultural Impact In December 1994 police found a pamphlet at the headquarters of Aum Shinrikyo that included a song called \\"Sarin the Brave,\\" a parody of Brave Raideen.Lifton, Robert Jay. Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism. Henry Holt and Company, 1999. First Edition. p. 185. . The Tubes recorded a song based on the show called \\"God-Bird-Change\\" written by Mingo Lewis in 1977. The stage show included dancers and the lead singer dressed as Raideen.

T. Studd (2 December 1860 ‚Äì 16 July 1931), was a British missionary, a contributor to The Fundamentals, and a cricketer. In 1888, he married Priscilla Stewart, and their marriage produced four daughters, and two sons (who died in infancy). As a British Protestant Christian missionary to China he was part of the Cambridge Seven, and later was responsible for setting up the Heart of Africa Mission which became the Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade (now WEC International). As a cricketer, he played for England in the 1882 match won by Australia, which was the origins of The Ashes. A poem he wrote, \\"Only One Life, 'Twill Soon Be Past\\", has become famous to many who are unaware of its author. Faith alt= Studd's wealthy father Edward Studd became a Christian during a Moody and Sankey campaign in England, and a visiting preacher to the Studd home, Tedworth House in Wiltshire, converted C.T. and his two brothers to the faith while they were students at Eton. According to his conversion narrative, the preacher asked him if he believed God's promises to give believers eternal life, and as Charles would only go so far as to profess he believed Jesus Christ died, the guest pressed the point, and Charles then believed on the Lord Jesus for salvation. Charles later recalled the moment: \\"I got down on my knees and I did say 'thank you' to God. And right then and there joy and peace came into my soul. I knew then what it was to be 'born again,' and the Bible which had been so dry to me before, became everything.\\" Studd continued from Eton to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1883. In 1884 after his brother George was taken seriously ill Charles was confronted by the question, \\"What is all the fame and flattery worth ... when a man comes to face eternity?\\" He had to admit that since his conversion six years earlier he had been in \\"an unhappy backslidden state\\". As a result of the experience he said, \\"I know that cricket would not last, and honour would not last, and nothing in this world would last, but it was worthwhile living for the world to come.\\" Studd emphasised the life of faith, believing that God would provide for a Christian's needs. His father died while he was in China, and he gave away his inheritance of ¬£29,000, specifying ¬£5,000 to be used for the Moody Bible Institute, ¬£5,000 for George M√ºller mission work and his orphans, ¬£5,000 for George Holland's work with England's poor in Whitechapel, and ¬£5,000 to Commissioner Booth Tucker for the Salvation Army in India. Studd believed that God's purposes could be confirmed through providential coincidences, such as a sum of money being donated spontaneously at just the right moment. He encouraged Christians to take risks in planning missionary ventures, trusting in God to provide. His spirituality was intense, and he mostly read only the Bible. Another work that influenced him was Hannah Whitall Smith's The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life. Although he believed that God sometimes healed physical illnesses through prayer and the anointing of oil, he also accepted that some ailments were chronic, and in his last years he regularly took morphine, causing some controversy. Studd also believed in plain speaking and muscular Christianity, and his call for Christians to embrace a \\"Don't Care a Damn\\" (DCD) attitude to worldly things caused some scandal. He believed that missionary work was urgent, and that those who were unevangelised would be condemned to hell. Studd wrote several books, including The Chocolate Soldier, or, Heroism: The Lost Chord of Christianity (1912) and Christ's Etceteras (1915). Studd's essay The Personal Testimony of Charles T. Studd became part of the historic The Fundamentals: A Testimony To The Truth, R. A. Torrey and A. C. Dixon (eds) (online version). Studd continues to be best remembered by many for the poem, \\"Only One Life, 'Twill Soon Be Past\\". Its memorable verse states: ::Only one life 'twill soon be past. ::Only what's done for Christ will last. This poem inspired the song \\"Only One Life\\" written by Lanny Wolfe in 1973. Missionary work Studd began as an evangelist, and among those he influenced were Wilfred Grenfell and Frederick Brotherton Meyer. As a result of his brother's illness and the effect it had upon him, he decided to pursue his faith through missionary work in China and was one of the \\"Cambridge Seven\\" who offered themselves to Hudson Taylor for missionary service at the China Inland Mission, leaving for there in February 1885. Of his missionary work he said,While in China he married Priscilla, in a ceremony performed by a Chinese pastor, and four daughters were born. Studd believed that God had given him daughters to educate the Chinese about the value of baby girls. On returning to England he was invited to visit America where his brother Kynaston had recently arranged meetings which had led to the formation of the Student Volunteer Movement. He also here influenced John Mott Between 1900‚Äì1906 Studd was pastor of a church at Ootacamund in Southern India and although it was a different situation to the pioneer missionary work he had undertaken in China, his ministry was marked by numerous conversions amongst the British officials and the local community. However, on his return home Studd met a German missionary named Karl Kumm, and he became concerned about the large parts of Africa that had never been reached with the Gospel. In 1910 he went to the Sudan and was concerned by the lack of Christian faith in central Africa. Out of this concern Studd was led to set up the Heart of Africa Mission. His speaking on the subject inspired Howard Mowll (Bishop of China, and later Archbishop of Sydney), Arthur Pitts-Pitts (of the Church Missionary Society in Kenya), and Graham Brown (Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem). As an HQ for the venture, the Studds chose 17 Highland Road in Upper Norwood, South London. Like Hudson-Taylor, Studd believed that funds for the work should not be directly solicited. Finances were often tenuous. However, he enjoyed the support of Lord Radstock. Against medical advice, Studd first visited the Belgian Congo in 1913 in the company of Alfred Buxton, and he established four mission stations in an area then inhabited by eight different tribes. Studd returned to England when Priscilla fell ill, but when he returned to the Congo in 1916 she had recovered sufficiently to undertake the expansion of the mission into the Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade with workers in South America, Central Asia and the Middle East as well as Africa. Supported by his wife's work at home, Studd built up an extensive missionary outreach based on his centre at Ibambi in Budu territory. Priscilla made a short visit to the Congo in 1928. That was the last time they met; she died the following year. Studd was joined in his work by his daughter Pauline and son-in-law Norman Grubb, and his grandson Noel Grubb, who died on his first birthday, is buried at Nala, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Studd's daughter Edith married Buxton. In 1931, still labouring for the Lord at Ibambi at the age of seventy, Charles Studd died from untreated gallstones, but his vision for China, India and Africa was maintained by Norman Grubb, who took charge of WEC. In total he spent some fifteen years in China and six in India on his missionary work and then he devoted the rest of his life to spreading the Gospel message in Africa, founding the Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade (now WEC International). To this day, his name remains linked with the evangelisation of the Congo Basin, and in 1930 he was made a Chevalier of the Royal Order of the Lion by the King of the Belgians. His biography, by Norman Grubb, was exceptionally popular, and some of his own writings are still in print. =Cambridge Seven= The Cambridge Seven The seven Cambridge students who became missionaries (known as the Cambridge Seven) to China were: * Charles Thomas Studd * Montagu Harry Proctor Beauchamp * Stanley P. Smith * Arthur T. Polhill-Turner * Dixon Edward Hoste * Cecil H. Polhill-Turner * William Wharton Cassels Cricketing career Studd gained fame as a cricketer representing England's Cambridge University Gentlemen of India and Middlesex. Charles was the youngest and best known of The Studd Brothers. By the time he was sixteen he had started to excel at cricket and at nineteen was captain of his team at Eton College; after school he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was also recognised as an outstanding cricketer. =Ashes, 1882= Studd played in the original Test against Australia where the Ashes were first named and was one of the last two batsman in. When Studd went in, England needed a mere ten runs to win. However, an eccentric performance by his batting partner Ted Peate led to the match being lost. A week later, the relevant edition of the Sporting Times included a mock obituary which has assumed iconic status: :IN AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE :OF ENGLISH CRICKET :WHICH DIED AT THE OVAL, 29 August 1882, :DEEPLY LAMENTED BY A LARGE CIRCLE OF :SORROWING FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES ::R.I.P. :N.B.-THE BODY WILL BE CREMATED AND THE :ASHES TAKEN TO AUSTRALIA. Studd's fame lives on though through the inscription preserved on the Ashes urn to this day, which reads, :When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn; :Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return; :The welkin will ring loud, :The great crowd will feel proud, :Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn; :And the rest coming home with the urn. Studd died in Ibambi, Belgian Congo 16 July 1931.

In February 1977, several months after the story first went public, Phillips was contacted by a Pakistani official trying to purchase his bomb design, an incident addressed on the Senate floor by William Proxmire and Charles Percy. Phillips was a celebrity by this time, dubbed The A-Bomb Kid by the media, and making a series of television appearances including a featured spot on the game show To Tell The Truth. Phillips was an underachieving student who played the tiger mascot at Princeton games. Hoping to stay at the school, he proposed a term paper for a seminar on nuclear proliferation outlining the design for an atomic bomb similar to the Nagasaki weapon. Whether the weapon as designed would have actually exploded was questioned. Dr. Frank Chilton, a California nuclear scientist who at that time specialized in nuclear explosion engineering, said Phillips‚Äôs design was \\"pretty much guaranteed to work.\\" However, Phillips' faculty advisor Freeman Dyson, a renowned physicist, and professor Harold Feiveson, who held the seminar, said Phillips' design was not functional.James Verini: Big Brother Inc.. Vanity Fair online, December 13, 2007 Nevertheless, the Federal Bureau of Investigation confiscated Phillips's term paper and a mockup he had constructed in his dormitory room. In 1979, Phillips published his story together with a co-author, David Michaelis, as Mushroom: The True Story of the A-Bomb Kid ( / ). Political activity Phillips parlayed his celebrity into a brief career as an anti-nuclear activist. In 1980 and 1982 he ran for the United States House of Representatives as a Democratic Party candidate in Connecticut's 4th congressional district, losing both times to Republican Stewart McKinney. Aristotle, Inc. The experience he had gained during his campaigns obtaining the voter list from the state and using it for campaign purposes led him and his brother Dean (who had written a program to handle the list on an Apple II) to found Aristotle, Inc. in 1983, a non-partisan technology consulting firm for political campaigns which John Philips has since led as the CEO. It specializes in combining voter lists with personal data from other sources (such as income, gun ownership or church attendance) and data-mining, to assist with micro-targeting of specific voter groups; as of 2007, its database contained detailed information about ca. 175 million U.S. voters and it had about 100 employees. Aristotle has served every occupant of the White House since Ronald Reagan, and consults for several top political action committees.Aristotle - Now You Know In 1998 he spoke of the critical importance to a political campaign of targeting its advertising, including on the world wide web. In 2009 he observed that 8.9% of registered voters in the United States are ineligible to vote because they have moved away or died. As of 2007, Phillips lived in San Francisco with his wife, Patricia and daughter, Katherine Grace. See also *Born secret *United States v.

It was used for general aviation and by St. George-based SkyWest Airlines on behalf of Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. SkyWest has served St. George since its founding in 1972. SkyWest, which is now one of the largest regional airlines in the world, continues to be based in St. George. Replacement airport The prospect of a new airport for the region had been around for many years. The old St. George Municipal Airport, located on top of a mesa, was land-locked and had no room for expansion. The runway and terminal were too small for larger aircraft. With the rapid growth of the area and tourism increasing, a new airport became essential. The new St. George Regional Airport () was built about 6 miles southeast of downtown at the site of an abandoned airfield, which had not seen air traffic since 1961 and most recently has been used for vehicle drag racing and radio controlled aircraft. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was completed in August 2006. The study concluded the impact on the environment and noise pollution would be minimal. Plans for the new airport include a single runway usable by regional jets and larger airliners. It is initially 9,300 by 150 feet, with plans for the runway to be extended to 11,500 ft. The new airport includes a precision instrument approach, which the old airport did not have. The new airport has been partially funded by grants from the Federal Aviation Administration totaling US$24.2 million. The project was expected to cost between $170 million and $190 million. The city broke ground on the new site in October 2008, and the new airport opened on January 13, 2011.  Facilities  The facility included a terminal. It had one asphalt runway, 16/34, 6,606 feet (2,014 m) long. In the year ending November 30, 2008 the airport had 62,210 aircraft operations, average 170 per day: 72% general aviation, 15% air taxi, 13 scheduled commercial, and <1% military. 177 aircraft were then based at this airport: 85% single-engine, 7% multi-engine, 2% jet, 4% helicopter, 1% glider and 1% ultralight.  Airlines  On January 13, 2011, all airline flights moved to the new St. George Municipal Airport, which has since been renamed St. George Regional Airport. The old airport was served by SkyWest Airlines (Delta Connection) flights to Salt Lake City and United Express flights to Los Angeles on Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners or Embraer EMB 120 Brasilias. From 1958 to 1960 Bonanza Air Lines Douglas DC-3s flew to Salt Lake City via Cedar City and Provo, and to Phoenix, Arizona via Prescott.http://www.timetableimages.com, January 4, 1959 Bonanza timetable After 1960 Bonanza F-27s only stopped at Cedar City;http://www.timetableimages.com, Jan. 16, 1963 Bonanza timetable on June 19, 1972 SkyWest started flying St. George to Salt Lake City via Cedar City.http://www.skywest.com, About, History, First Flight  References   External links  * St. George Municipal Airport, official website * St. George Replacement Airport Environmental Impact Statement * Aerial photo as of 24 June 1993 from USGS The National Map Category:Airports in Utah Category:Airports established in 1972 Category:Buildings and structures in St. George, Utah Category:Transportation in Washington County, Utah es:Aeropuerto Municipal de St. George ","title":"St. George Municipal Airport"},{"id":"2134771","text":"First edition The Coming Victory of Democracy is a book published in 1938 by Alfred A.

Studd was the second eldest of the famous Studd brothers, who dominated English cricket in the late 19th century. He played in four Tests with the English cricket team, and played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Middlesex County Cricket Club. Studd was born at Netheravon House, near Amesbury, Wiltshire, England. He won his cricket Colours for Eton in 1877 when he scored 32 and 23 against Harrow and 54 against Winchester. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1878, where he won his Blue as a freshman and played in the University match, against Oxford, four times. He made 38 and 40 against Oxford in 1880, and he and two of his brothers, Kynaston and Charles, were together in the Cambridge team in 1881 and 1882. George was captain of Cambridge in 1882, when he scored 120, which at the time was only the seventh three-figure score and the second highest in University matches. While primarily a cricketer, George also played against Oxford in singles and doubles tennis during his last two years as an undergraduate at Cambridge. In 1882, he made 819 runs in first-class matches and then scored 289 while playing for the Cambridge Long Vacation Club. George and his brother Charles toured Australia in 1882/3 with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) captained by the Honourable Ivo Bligh. The team won back the Ashes, but George disappointed in the four Tests in which he played, scoring only 31 runs in 7 innings. George was called to the Bar, but never practised. Like his brother Charles, he became a missionary, initially with the Peniel Mission of Theodore and Manie Payne Ferguson, before joining the Apostolic Faith mission in September 1907. From 1891 until his death, he lived and worked in a notorious and squalid area of Southern Los Angeles in California.

Pages 57-58, 138. located in northwest Iran (in the province of West Azerbaijan), a short distance south of Lake Urmia. The nature of its destruction at the end of the 9th century BC essentially froze one layer of the city in time, providing researchers with extremely well preserved buildings, artifacts, and skeletal remains from the victims and enemy combatants of the attack. Hasanlu Tepe is the largest site in the Gadar River valley and dominates the small plain known as Solduz. The site consists of a 25-m-high central \\"citadel\\" mound, with massive fortifications and paved streets, surrounded by a low outer town, 8 m above the surrounding plain. The entire site, once much larger but reduced in size by local agricultural and building activities, now measures about 600 m across, with the citadel having a diameter of about 200 m. The site was inhabited fairly continuously from the 6th millennium BC to the 3rd century AD. It is famous for the Golden bowl of Hasanlu. The Hasanlu Golden Bowl. Thirty Years Later, Expedition, vol. 31, no. 203, pp. 87-106, 1989 Since June 2018, the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization has pushed for the entire archeological site to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Name and etymology The site is named after the nearby village of ·∏®asanl≈´ () . Tepe (, also Romanized teppe, tappeh, etc.) is the Persian word for tell or hill, derived from Turkish.https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=tepe Archaeology After some licensed commercial digging by dealers, the site was first dug by Aurel Stein in 1936.

(see external link, below) The unexpected discovery of the famous \\"Gold Bowl\\" at Hasanlu in 1958 led to the project shifting its focus to the Iron Age levels at this site, although several other sites in the region were also excavated in order to stay in line with the project's broader objective. These other excavations were conducted at Dinkha Tepe, Dalma Tepe, Hajji Firuz Tepe, Agrab Tepe, Pisdeli, and Seh Girdan. The Hasanlu Publications Project was initiated in 2007 to produce the official monograph-length final reports on the excavation.Hasanlu Publications Project; Currently two Excavation Reports and several Special Studies volumes have been completed.Irene J.

It is approximately 50 m in diameter. It was excavated by Charles Burney and T. Cuyler Young, Jr., in 1958-1961.DALMƒÄ TEPE Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Large quantities of handmade, chaff-tempered pottery were found.T. Cuyler Young, Jr. (1963), Dalma Painted Ware penn.museum This includes 'Dalma plain ware', 'Dalma impressed ware', and 'Dalma red-slipped ware', which was covered with a uniform coat of dark-red paint. There was a variety of shapes. 'Dalma painted ware' is decorated with large patterns of triangles in deep shades on red. Conical clay spindle whorls were also found. Dalma pottery represents Period IX at ·∏§asanl≈´ Tepe, and is dated to around 5000-4500 BCE. Links with Level XVI at Tepe Gawra have been identified, which, in northern Iraq, represents Ubaid 3 period. Similar pottery has been found at Seh GƒÅbƒ´ and Godin Tepe, attributed to Period X. Kul Tepe Jolfa is another related site from the same period. It is located north of Lake Urmia. History The excavators originally divided the site‚Äôs occupation history into ten periods based on the nature of material finds in the different strata: the oldest, period X, stretches back to the Neolithic period, after which there was fairly continuous occupation until the early Iron Age (ca 1250-330 BC), followed by a hiatus before subsequent reoccupation; occupation finally ends in Iran‚Äôs medieval period (Hasanlu period I). Hasanlu Publications Project: see 'overview' tab for chronology. =Middle Bronze Age= Starting in the Middle Bronze III period or Hasanlu VIa (1600‚Äì1450 BC), there are important changes in material culture. This is best attested at the site of Dinkha Tepe, but is also present at Hasanlu. The most obvious change is the rapid abandonment of old styles of pottery, especially painted Khabur Ware, and the increased importance in producing monochrome unpainted pottery that is frequently polished or burnished. This ware is known as Monochrome Burnished Ware or, formerly, \\"Grey Ware\\"; however the ware occurs in a wide range of colors and thus is something of a misnomer. =Late Bronze Age= In the Late Bronze Age or Hasanlu Period V, Monochrome Burnished Ware came to dominate the ceramic assemblages of the Ushnu and Solduz valleys of the southern Lake Urmia Basin. Some scholars link changes in pottery forms to cultural contact with Assyria, this being a period of expansion for the Middle Assyrian kingdom, when such kings as Adad-nirari I (1295-1264 BC), Shalmaneser I (1263-1234 BC), and Tukulti-Ninurta I (1233-1197 BC) were conducting campaigns into the Zagros mountains to the south.Dyson, Robert H (1965). \\"Problems of Protohistoric Iran as Seen from Hasanlu\\"; Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 24, No. 3, pp. 193-9. During this time, there was occupation on the High Mound and Low Mound of Hasanlu, and graves have been excavated at Dinkha Tepe and Hasanlu. =Iron Age= At around 1250 BC, there are some changes in the material culture at Hasanlu and in the graves excavated at Dinkha. This marks the beginning of the Iron I period, formerly identified with Hasanlu Period V but now the equivalent of Hasanlu IVc. While this period is designated the Iron I, there is virtually no iron in use during this period ‚Äî two iron finger rings are known from Hasanlu. The High Mound of Hasanlu was almost certainly fortified during this period, and an internal gateway, large residential structures, and possibly a temple were located in this citadel. The Low Mound was also occupied. The best evidence of this coming from a house excavated in 1957 and 1959 dubbed the \\"Artisan's House\\". This structure derives its name from the fact that evidence for metalworking, primarily the casting of copper/bronze objects, was found there. At the end of Hasanlu IVc/Iron I, Hasanlu was destroyed by a fire. Evidence of this destruction was discovered on the High and Low Mound. This destruction dates to around 800 BC and it marks the beginning of the Iron II period. While the destruction was extensive, the settlement's occupants seem to have rebuilt the citadel and the buildings of the Lower Town rapidly, cutting down the mudbrick walls of the burned structures to their stone footings and erecting new brick walls. The buildings of the Iron II settlement were based on their Iron I precursors, but were also larger and more elaborate in their layout and ornamentation. The primary example of this being the monumental columned halls of the citadel. The continued presence in significant quantities of Assyrian goods or copies, alongside objects of local manufacture, attest to continued cultural contact with Assyria at this time; iron first appears in bulk at Hansanlu at around the same time Assyria seized control of the metal trade in Asia Minor.Oscar White Muscarella, Hasanlu in the Ninth Century B. C. and Its Relations with Other Cultural Centers of the Near East, American Journal of Archaeology, vol. 75, No. 3, pp. 263-266, 1971 While the Neo-Assyrian Empire was beginning a period of renewed power and influence in the 9th century, it is also at this time that the existence of the kingdom of Urartu, centered around Lake Van, is first attested in the Neo-Assyrian annals and related literature. By the time we hear about it, it is already a fully developed state - the circumstances attending its rise in the 2nd millennium are obscure.Kuhrt, Am√©lie (1995). The Ancient Near East (Vol. 2); Routledge, New York, p.548ff. Urartu‚Äôs expansion during this period brought the area south of Lake Urmia under its influence, although material finds at Hasanlu suggest that the city may have remained independent.Dyson, Robert H (1989). \\"Constructing the Chronology and Historical Implications of Hasanlu IV\\"; Iran, Vol. 27, pp.18-9, 22. Nevertheless, Hansanlu was catastrophically destroyed, We know a great deal about Iron II/Hasanlu IVb because of the violent sacking and burning at around 800 BC, probably by the Urartians.Inna Medvedskaya, Who Destroyed Hasanlu IV?, Iran, vol. 26, pp. 1-15, 1988 Over 150 human victims were found where they had been slain. Some victims were mutilated and distributions of other bodies and the wounds they received suggest mass executions. Amid the burned remains of the settlement the excavators found thousands of objects in situ. Hasanlu IVb is a veritable Pompeii of the early Iron Age Near East. Some have suggested that the Iron II culture of Hasanlu, which has close ties to Mesopotamia and northern Syria, indicates the settlement came under the control of a foreign power, or experienced an influx of new occupants, or perhaps made internal changes to its political system. The Iron II settlement was fortified and was perhaps entered via a fortified road system located on the southwest side of the High Mound, although this interpretation of the archaeological remains of this area has come under increasing scrutiny in more recent analyses. Two areas of the citadel were investigated by the Hasanlu Project. In the west, buildings that served to control access into the citadel, a possible arsenal (Burned Building VII), and a large residential structure (Burned Building III) were investigated. South of this was Burned Building (BB) I and BB I East. These buildings formed a fortified gateway into the Lower Court area. BBI was also an elite residence. It was in this building in 1958 that the famous Gold Bowl of Hasanlu was discovered. The buildings of the Lower Court (BBII, BBIV, BBBIV East, and BBV) were arranged around a stone-paved court. Burned Building II likely served as a temple, and it was in this building that the excavators found over 70 massacred women and children ‚Äî only a few adult males were found among the victims. Following Hasanlu's destruction, the High Mound was used as the site for a Urartian fortress. A fortification wall with towers at regular intervals was constructed around the edges of the High Mound. Hasanlu was occupied fairly continuously during Period IIIa (the Achaemenid Period) and Period II (the Seleuco-Parthian Period).Robert H.

The plant is of great cultural importance to the traditional animistic religions of Austronesian and Papuan peoples of the Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Island Southeast Asia, and Papua New Guinea. It is also cultivated for food, traditional medicine, and as an ornamental for its variously colored leaves. It is identified by a wide variety of common names, including ti plant, palm lily, cabbage palm, and good luck plant. Names The reconstructed Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word for ti is *siRi. Cognates include Malagasy s√≠ly; Palauan sis; Ere and Kuruti siy; Araki jihi; Arosi diri; Chuukese tii-n; Wuvulu si or ti; Tongan sƒ´; Samoan, Tahitian, and MƒÅori tƒ´; and Hawaiian kƒ´. The names in some languages have also been applied to the garden crotons (Codiaeum variegatum), which similarly have red or yellow leaves. The cognates of Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian *sabaqa≈ã, similarly, have been applied to both garden crotons and ti plants. In the Philippines, they are also known by names derived from the Proto-Austronesian *kilala, \\"to know\\", due to its use in divination rituals. Cognates derived from that usage include Tagalog sagilala; and Visayan and Bikol kil√°la or kilaa, though in Central Visayas, this plant is called ti-as. In New Zealand, the terms for ti were also transferred to the native and closely related cabbage tree (Cordyline australis), as tƒ´ k≈çuka. Taxonomy Cordyline fruticosa was formerly listed as part of the families Agavaceae and Laxmanniaceae (now both subfamilies of the Asparagaceae in the APG III system). Description Ti is a palm-like plant growing up to tall with an attractive fan-like and spirally arranged cluster of broadly elongated leaves at the tip of the slender trunk. It has numerous color variations, ranging from plants with red leaves to green and variegated forms. It is a woody plant with leaves (rarely ) long and wide at the top of a woody stem. It produces long panicles of small scented yellowish to red flowers that mature into red berries. Distribution and history Its original native distribution is unknown, but it is believed to be native to the region from Bangladesh, to Mainland Southeast Asia, South China, Taiwan, Island Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Northern Australia. It has the highest morphological diversity in New Guinea and is believed to have been extensively cultivated there. It was carried throughout Oceania by Austronesians, reaching as far as Hawaii, New Zealand (including the Kermadec Islands), and Easter Island at their furthest extent. A particularly important type of ti in eastern Polynesia is a large green-leafed cultivar grown for their enlarged edible rhizomes. Unlike the ti populations in Southeast Asia and Near Oceania, this cultivar is almost entirely sterile in the further islands of eastern Polynesia. It can be propagated only by cuttings from the stalks or the rhizomes. It is speculated that this was the result of deliberate artificial selection, probably because they produce larger and less fibrous rhizomes more suitable for use as food. Cultivation and uses =Religious= Ti plants as wedding decoration in 360px Ti has many uses but it is most notable as one of the most important plants related to the indigenous animist religions of Austronesians. It is very widely regarded as having mystical or spiritual powers in various Austronesian (as well as Papuan) cultures. Among a lot of ethnic groups in Austronesia it is regarded as sacred. Common features include the belief that they can hold souls and thus are useful in healing \\"soul loss\\" illnesses and in exorcising against malevolent spirits, their use in ritual attire and ornamentation, and their use as boundary markers. Red and green cultivars also commonly represented dualistic aspects of culture and religion and are used differently in rituals. Red ti plants commonly symbolize blood, war, and the ties between the living and the dead; while green ti plants commonly symbolize peace and healing. They are also widely used for traditional medicine, dye, and ornamentation throughout Austronesia and New Guinea. Their ritual uses in Island Southeast Asia have largely been obscured by the introduction of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity, but they still persist in certain areas or are co√∂pted for the rituals of the new religions. Red ti planted alongside traditional houses of the Ifugao people in the Banaue Rice Terraces, Philippines In Philippine anitism, ti were commonly used by babaylan (female shamans) when conducting mediumship or healing rituals. A common belief in Filipino cultures is that the plant has the innate ability to host spirits. Among the Ifugao people of Northern Luzon, it is planted around terraces and communities to drive away evil spirits as well as mark boundaries of cultivated fields. The red leaves are believed to be attractive to spirits and is worn during important rituals as part of the headdresses and tucked into armbands. In the past, it was also worn during ceremonial dances called bangibang, which was performed by both men and women for warriors who died in battle or through violent means. They are also used to decorate ritual objects. Among the Palaw'an people, it is planted in burial grounds to prevent the dead from becoming malevolent spirits. Toraja houses in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi In Indonesia, red ti are used similarly as in the Philippines. Among the Dayak, Sundanese, Kayan, Kenyah, Berawan, Iban and Mongondow people, red ti are used as wards against evil spirits and as boundary markers. They are also used in rituals like in healing and funerals and are very commonly planted in sacred groves and around shrines. The Dayak also extract a natural green dye from ti. During healing rituals of the Mentawai people, the life- giving spirit are enticed with songs and offerings to enter ti stems which are then reconciled with the sick person. Among the Sasak people, green ti leaves are used as part of the offerings to spirits by the belian shamans. Among the Baduy people, green ti represent the body, while red ti represent the soul. Both are used in rice planting rituals. They are also planted on burial grounds. Among the Balinese and Karo people, ti plants are planted near village or family shrines in a sacred grove. Among the Toraja people, red ti plants are used in rituals and as decorations of ritual objects. They are believed to occur in both the material and the spirit worlds (a common belief in Austronesian animism). In the spirit world, they exist as fins and tails of spirits. In the material world, they are most useful as guides used to attract the attentions of spirits. The red leaves are also symbolic of blood and thus of life and vitality. Among the Ngaju people, ti plants were symbolic of the sacred groves of ancestors. They were also important in ritual promises dedicated to high gods. They were regarded as symbolic of the masculine \\"Tree of Life\\", in a dichotomy against Ficus species which symbolize the feminine \\"Tree of the Dead\\". Feral green ti plants in Maui In New Guinea, ti are commonly planted to indicate land ownership for cultivation and are also planted around ceremonial men's houses. They are also used in various rituals and are commonly associated with blood and warfare. Among the Tsembaga Maring people, they are believed to house \\"red spirits\\" (spirits of men who died in battle). Prior to a highly ritualized (but lethal) warfare over land ownership, they are uprooted and pigs are sacrificed to the spirits. After the hostilities, they are re-planted in the new land boundaries depending on the outcome of the fight. The men involved ritually place their souls into the plants. The ritual warfare have been suppressed by the Papua New Guinea government, but parts of the rituals still survive. Among the Ankave people, red ti is part of their creation myth, believed as having arisen from the site of the first murder. Among the Mendi and Sulka people they are made into dyes used as body paint, and their leaves are used for body adornments and purification rituals. Among the Nikgini people, the leaves have magical abilities to bring good luck and are used in divination and in decorating ritual objects. Among the Kapauku people, ti plants are regarded as magical plants and are believed to be spiritual beings themselves. Unlike other magical plants which are controlled by other spirits, ti plants had their own spirits and are powerful enough to command other spiritual beings. Red plants are used in white magic rituals, while green plants are used in black magic rituals. They are also commonly used in protection and warding rituals. Among the Baktaman people, red plants are used for initiation rites, while green plants are used for healing. The Ok-speaking peoples also regard ti plants as their collective totem. Pu ªu Moaulanui heiau (temple) in the summit of Kaho ªolawe, Hawaii Hula dancers in a Luau in LƒÅhainƒÅ, in traditional kƒ´ leaf skirts In Island Melanesia, ti are regarded as sacred by various Austronesian- speaking peoples and are used in rituals for protection, divination, and fertility. Among the Kwaio people, red ti are associated with feuding and vengeance, while green ti are associated with ancestor spirits, markers of sacred groves, and wards against evil. The Kwaio cultivate these varieties around their communities. Among the Maenge people of New Britain, ti leaves are worn as everyday skirts by women. The color and size of leaves can vary by personal preference and fashion. New cultivars with different colors are traded regularly and strands of ti are grown near the village. Red leaves can only worn by women past puberty. Ti is also the most important plant in magic and healing rituals of the Maenge. Some ti cultivars are associated with supernatural spirits and have names and folklore around them. In Vanuatu, Cordyline leaves, known locally by the Bislama name nanggaria, are worn tucked into a belt in traditional dances like MƒÅ ªulu ªulu, with different varieties having particular symbolic meanings. Cordylines are often planted outside nakamal buildings. In Fiji, red ti leaves are used as skirts for dancers and are used in rituals dedicated to the spirits of the dead. They are also planted around ceremonial buildings used for initiation rituals. Ti leaf bundles (puolo) used as offerings to spirits in Hawaii In Micronesia, ti leaves are buried under newly built houses in Pohnpei to ward of malign sorcery. In instances of an unknown death, shamans in Micronesia communicate with the dead spirit through ti plants, naming various causes of death until the plant trembles. There is also archaeological evidence that the rhizomes of the plants were eaten in the past in Guam prior to the Latte Period. In Polynesia, green ti were cultivated widely for food and religious purposes. They are commonly planted around homes, in sacred places (including marae and heiau), and in grave sites. The leaves are also carried as a charm when traveling and the leaves are used in rituals that communicate with the species. Like in Southeast Asia, they are widely believed to protect against evil spirits and bad luck; as well as having the ability to host spirits of dead people, as well as nature spirits. In ancient Hawaii the plant was thought to have great spiritual power; only kahuna (shamans) and alii (chiefs) were able to wear leaves around their necks during certain ritual activities. Ti was sacred to the god of fertility and agriculture Lono, and the goddess of the forest and the hula dance, Laka. Ti leaves were also used to make lei, and to outline borders between properties it was also planted at the corners of the home to keep evil spirits away. To this day some Hawaiians plant tƒ´ near their houses to bring good luck. The leaves are also used for lava sledding. A number of leaves are lashed together and people ride down hills on them. The leaves were also used to make items of clothing including skirts worn in dance performances. The Hawaiian hula skirt is a dense skirt with an opaque layer of at least fifty green leaves and the bottom (top of the leaves) shaved flat. The Tongan dance dress, the sisi, is an apron of about 20 leaves, worn over a tupenu, and decorated with some yellow or red leaves. In Aotearoa, certain place names are derived from the use and folklore of ti, like Puketƒ´ Forest and Temuka. The ti plants in Kaingaroa are known as nga tƒ´ whakƒÅwe o Kaingaroa (\\"the phantom trees of Kaingaroa\\"), based on the legend of two women who were turned into ti plants and seemingly follow people traveling through the area. =Other uses= They are also widely used for traditional medicine, dye, and ornamentation throughout Austronesia and New Guinea. Cordyline terminalis flowers are a traditional treatment for asthma, and their anthocyanin content has been assessed to see if they might be commercial herbal remedy. In the Philippines, the roots were used to flavor the traditional intus sugarcane wines of the Lumad people of Mindanao. In Polynesia, the leaves of the green- leafed form are used to wrap food, line earth ovens and fermentation pits of breadfruit, and their rhizomes harvested and processed into a sweet molasses- like pulp eaten like candy or used to produce a honey-like liquid used in various sweet treats. In Hawaii, the roots are also mixed with water and fermented into an alcoholic beverage known as okolehao. Fibers extracted from leaves are also used in cordage and in making bird traps. The consumption of ti as food, regarded as a sacred plant and thus was originally taboo, is believed to have been a daring innovation of Polynesian cultures as a response to famine conditions. The lifting of the taboo is believed to be tied to the development of the firewalking ritual. Ti is a popular ornamental plant, with numerous cultivars available, many of them selected for green or reddish or purple foliage.

The breechblock is locked into place by the hammer, thus preventing the cartridge from moving backwards at the moment of firing. By cocking the hammer, the breechblock can be rotated freely to reload the weapon. History Due to 19th century metallurgical techniques, as with most vintage firearms produced for black powder cartridges, rifles and pistols manufactured using this action during the 19th and early 20th centuries may not be suitable for modern, high powered ammunition. Since the early 20th century rolling block rifles in modern steels, suitable for smokeless powder cartridges, have been made for cartridges like the 7x57mm Mauser. The Remington Rolling Block rifle is one of the most successful single shot weapons ever developed. It is a strong and simple action, very reliable, and not prone to be jammed by dirt or rough usage. It was based in part on the \\"split breech\\" action produced by Remington during the United States Civil War. That design was re-engineered by Joseph Rider during 1865, and the first firearm based on it, the Model 1865 Remington Pistol, was offered for sale to the United States Army and Navy in 1866. While the Army turned the design down, the Navy committed to purchase 5000 pistols. The first rifle based on this design was introduced at the Paris Exposition in 1867, and within a year it had become the standard military rifle of several nations, including Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Many earlier percussion rifles and muskets were converted to rolling block designs in the interim before the development of more modern bolt-action designs. The Swedish-Norwegian Remington M1867 and US Springfield Model 1871 had this action.

Originally developed in the 1970s by master theater artist and educator Mary Overlie, the Six Viewpoints has been studied and practiced for decades in theatre and dance. Overlie's practice and theory profoundly enables access to the source of inspiration and creativity. The Six Viewpoints, if practiced in the purest form, is found to be indescribably powerful and effective in all areas of investigation of, and for making art. In the simplest form, it is a practice for improvisation. The Six Viewpoints theory was adapted by directors Anne Bogart and Tina Landau over the course of 10 years, ultimately resulting in the delineation of nine \\"physical\\" Viewpoints and 5 \\"vocal\\" ones. Bogart and Overlie were on the faculty of ETW at NYU in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which time Bogart was influenced by Overlie's innovations. Overlie's Six Viewpoints (space, story, time, emotion, movement, and shape) are considered to be a logical way to examine, analyze and create art in a profound way while Bogart's Viewpoints are considered practical in creating staging with actors. Overlie's Viewpoints SYSTEMS is a mnemonic device for the six elements of Overlie's viewpoints (the actual acronym is spelled SSTEMS: Space, Shape, Time, Emotion, Movement, and Story,) and also signifies which elements Mary Overlie considered the most important. Note the change from the classical and modern periods in performance art, where story always took precedence over the other elements. Viewpoints is part of the post-modern tradition, in that there is no hierarchy in the different elements that make \\"theatre.\\" =Space= *Architecture - The physical environment, the space, and whatever belongs to it or constitutes it, including permanent and non- permanent features. *Spatial Relationship - Distance between objects on stage; one body in relation to another, to a group, or to the architecture. *Topography - The movement over landscape, floor pattern, design and colours. =Shape= *Shape - The contour or outline of bodies in space; the shape of the body by itself, in relation to other bodies, or in relation to architecture; think of lines, curves, angles, arches all stationary or in motion. *Gesture - a) Behavioral gesture: realistic gesture belonging to the physical world as we observe it every day. b) Expressive gesture: abstract or symbolic gesture expressing an inner state or emotion; it is not intended as a public or \\"realistic\\" gesture. =Time= *Tempo - How quickly or slowly something happens on stage. *Duration - How long an event occurs over time; how long a person or a group maintains a particular movement, tempo, gesture, etc. before it changes. *Kinesthetic Response - A spontaneous reaction to a motion that occurs outside of oneself. An instinctive response to an external stimulus. (realistic/non-realistic) *Repetition - a) Internal: repeating a movement done with one's own body, and b) External: repeating a movement occurring outside one's body. =Emotion= Psychological or narrative content ascribed to movement. =Movement= *Movement of your body, different ways of moving - for example, jerky versus smooth/flowing versus very slowly or fast. The movement of different parts of your body. =Story= *Perceptual ability to see and understand logic systems as an arrangement of collected information All of the different elements influence each other and work together, and can \\"cause\\" a change in a different element. For example, the shape of your body may carry a certain emotion with it as well - something in the space of your environment may make a story out of what you are doing - etc. The actors must focus first on the isolation of each separate viewpoint element on its own, before integrating and working them all together. It's often that a performer finds one of the elements comes naturally, and perhaps uses that one element they really understand to access the other elements, which they must work to become more familiar with. Bogart's and Landau's Viewpoints In their book, The Viewpoints Book: A Practical Guide to Viewpoints and Composition, Anne Bogart and Tina Landau identify the primary Viewpoints as those relating to Time - which are Tempo, Duration, Kinesthetic Response, and Repetition - and those relating to Space - which are Shape, Gesture, Architecture, Spatial Relationship and Topography. In addition, Bogart and Landau have added the Vocal Viewpoints which include Pitch, Volume, and Timbre. In the book, the authors outline the basics of the Viewpoints training they both espouse as well as specific methods for applying the Viewpoints to both rehearsals and production. For Bogart and Landau, the Viewpoints represent not only a physical technique but also a philosophical, spiritual, and aesthetic approach to many aspects of their work. Bogart references her work with the SITI company, and Landau with the Steppenwolf Theater Company. Bogart recognizes that these are not the only Viewpoints, just the ones she finds most useful for the actors with whom she works. Works cited Further reading * Bogart, Anne. 2001.

Among the photographers that she worked with was Irving Klaw. In 1950, she was accused of hitting fellow stripper, Emerald Forrest, over the head with a club. When asked of the charges, Louise responded: \\"T'ain't so\\". By the late 1950s, her marriage to Burtman had begun to deteriorate, and they divorced. Soon after, she left the magazine and disappeared from the public eye. She was one of the most famous fetish models of her day, but, as time went on, she was overshadowed by her peer, Bettie Page.

These \\"cartunes\\" were released by Universal Pictures from 1939 to 1947, and United Artists from 1948 to 1949. The title character is an anthropomorphic cartoon character, a cute panda. Andy became the second star of the Walter Lantz cartoons after Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. He achieved considerable popularity until being eventually supplanted by Woody Woodpecker. History When Oswald the Lucky Rabbit retired in 1938, following a nine-year run, Walter Lantz's studio went for months without recurring characters. It wasn't until late 1937, when Lantz had a trip to a zoo. There, the main attraction of the place was a young panda which Lantz drew pictures of. He would then use his drawings to construct a new character. Andy's first cartoon was the aptly titled Life Begins for Andy Panda in 1939. (This was obvious wordplay on the perky titles of the popular Andy Hardy movies of that era. Coincidentally, a later Andy Hardy film was actually titled Life Begins for Andy Hardy.) In the first three cartoons of the series, Andy's companion was a feisty turtle named Mr. Whippletree who was a caricature of Eddie Anderson. And Papa Panda‚ÄîAndy's father‚Äî was often the fall guy for Andy‚Äôs pranks. When the turtle disappeared from the series, Papa began to function as both companion and foil. Andy was at first a mischievous cub, whose blustery Papa is frequently trying to prove himself as a good role model. Later, Andy became a stand-alone star in the vein of Mickey Mouse, and even acquired a Pluto-like dog named Milo as a pet. The 1940 Andy Panda short Knock Knock featured the first appearance of Lantz's most famous character, Woody Woodpecker. By 1942, Andy Panda started wearing clothes and shoes in Nutty Pine Cabin. The character was then given a major overhaul by director Shamus Culhane for the 1944 short The Painter and the Pointer, with a far more malicious personality than he had ever shown previously, but this new version was disliked by both Lantz and audiences, and was not used again. Lantz continued to produce Andy Panda shorts until he closed his studio in 1949; Andy's last short was Scrappy Birthday (1949), which featured his girlfriend, Miranda Panda (voiced by Grace Stafford). When the studio reopened in 1950, the Andy Panda series never returned to production. Andy led a major part of his career in comic books, in Dell Comics' Crackajack Comics and New Funnies. One early Andy Panda comic book adventure was drawn by Carl Barks (New Funnies 76, 1943). John Stanley also did Andy Panda comic book work. In two 1943 cartoons, Andy Panda's Victory Garden and Meatless Tuesday, Andy's foil was a nameless rooster. In late 1943, this rooster became Andy's comic book sidekick, Charlie Chicken: \\"hatched\\" in NF 79 and rapidly growing into the cartoon model. Stories about Andy's and Charlie's often-bizarre adventures ran for many years. Some were reprinted domestically as recently as the 1990s, and in Sweden as recently as 2001. Filmography Other appearances Andy also appeared alongside Woody in shorts such as Banquet Busters and Musical Moments from Chopin. He also had a cameo in The Woody Woodpecker Polka with Miranda Panda, Oswald Rabbit, and Charlie Chicken. In print, Andy Panda appeared in a Whitman Publishing 1943‚Äì1944 Better Little Book \\"Andy Panda and Tiny Tom\\" which differed from the usual Big Little Book format by having art on every page instead of art on alternate pages. Andy was scheduled to appear as a cameo in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit at the deleted scene \\"Acme's Funeral\\". The character appears in the new Woody Woodpecker series voiced by Scott Weil. Andy also has a more mature voice with a Southern twang in this series.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5seQr1wMELc See also * List of fictional bears * List of Walter Lantz cartoon characters References External links Andy Panda at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

In the deal, Barrick had the option to purchase the property on right of first refusal. While it was not announced at the time, Barrick shared ownership of the buildings with Tamares Real Estate Investments which also owns the land under these properties. In October, 2004, Barrick acquired the Queen of Hearts Hotel & Casino and the Nevada Hotel & Casino. On November 10, 2004 Barrick announced that it would acquire the Golden Nugget Laughlin for $31 million plus working capital. As part of the purchase agreement, Poster Financial Group granted Barrick a two-year limited use of the Golden Nugget brand name, after which Barrick will be required to change the name of the property. However, on May 31, 2005 the agreement for Barrick Gaming to acquire the Golden Nugget Laughlin expired without a final deal being reached. As a result, Landry's Restaurants, Inc. would acquire the property as part of its agreement to purchase the Golden Nugget Las Vegas. In a further development, on June 28, 2005 Barrick announced that it would sell its interest in the first 4 properties it acquired to the privately owned Tamares.

It formed a turning point in the history of the province. Background After fascism came to an end in Italy, the situation of the Austrian population in South Tyrol seemed to be getting better. However, a large section of the population was not ready to accept the status quo as existed under Benito Mussolini. Even though fundamental questions were addressed in the Treaty of Paris, the conditions of the treaty were rarely fully fulfilled. In addition, many German speakers of the province wanted to renege their attachment to Italy and to once again become part of Austria and others wanted to become self-governing. Starting in 1957, small militant groups were prepared to use force to achieve their aims. The night of fire was the starting point for a series of attacks throughout the 1960s, planned and carried out by a group called the South Tyrolean Liberation Committee (Befreiungsausschuss S√ºdtirol (BAS)). Aims The aim of the attacks was, first and foremost, to make the world aware of the South Tyrolean question. By blowing up the electricity pylons the electricity supply to the Bolzano industrial zone was cut off. This goal was not achieved during the night of fire, but the world was indeed made aware of the plight of the province. The immediate response of the Italian state was to massively increase the military and police presence there. One month later there was another attempt, at a smaller scale, which did indeed cut off the power supply to a part of the northern Italian industrial zone and forced international trains to grind to a halt.

Her mother, Isabella Barge, was a nurse. Her father, Nicholas Goldfrapp, had been an army officer, and worked in advertising. Goldfrapp's surname is of German origin, and she has German ancestry through her father. While Goldfrapp was growing up, her family moved frequently, eventually settling in Alton, Hampshire, where Goldfrapp attended the independent Alton Convent School. She sang in a choir at the school and has said that she loved being in a school with nuns. However she was forced to leave at age 11 due to failing the senior exam, and attended the local comprehensive school, Amery Hill School. She moved into a squat in London aged 16. At 24 years old, she attended Middlesex University where she studied fine art and mixed media. Career In 1994, she featured on the Orbital album Snivilisation and recorded songs \\"The Good\\" and \\"The Bad\\" with trip reggae outfit Dreadzone, for their 'best of' album The Best of Dreadzone ‚Äì The Good The Bad and the Dread. Performing with them live resulted in two songs on the limited edition Performance album released in 1994. In the same year Goldfrapp featured on trip hop artist Tricky's 1995 song \\"Pumpkin\\" and collaborated with Stefan Girardet on two songs on the soundtrack to the 1995 film The Confessional. Goldfrapp was introduced to composer Will Gregory in 1999 after he had listened to her vocal contribution for \\"Pumpkin\\", they then formed Goldfrapp and signed to Mute Records. The pair began recording their debut album over a six-month period, beginning in September 1999, in a rented bungalow in the Wiltshire countryside. The band's debut album Felt Mountain was released in 2000 and featured Goldfrapp's synthesized vocals over cinematic soundscapes. Goldfrapp released their second album Black Cherry in 2003. The band recorded the album in Bath, England. This album focused more heavily on dance music and glam rock-inspired synths than its predecessor. Black Cherry peaked at number nineteen on the UK Albums Chart and sold 52,000 copies in the US. Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. It has sold one million copies worldwide and earned the duo two nominations at the 2007 Grammy Awards for Best Electronic/Dance Album and Best Dance Recording for the song \\"Ooh La La\\". Seventh Tree, Goldfrapp's fourth album, was released in 2008 and debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart. The album is a departure from the pop and electronic dance music featured on Supernature, featuring ambient and downtempo music. The band were inspired by an acoustic radio session they had performed, which led the duo to incorporate acoustic guitars into their music to create \\"warm\\" and \\"delicate\\" sounds. In 2009, she was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree by the University of Portsmouth. Goldfrapp have released seven albums, most recently Silver Eye in 2017. Hits include \\"Strict Machine\\", \\"Ooh La La\\", \\"Lovely Head\\" and \\"A&E;\\". The multi-platinum selling band have been nominated for the Mercury Prize, multiple Grammy Awards and won an Ivor Novello for \\"Strict Machine\\". Goldfrapp scored the films My Summer of Love and Nowhere Boy. In recent years, Goldfrapp has dedicated more time to her role as a photographer and director. She created and photographed the album artwork for Silver Eye and directed videos for singles \\"Systemagic\\", \\"Everything Is Never Enough\\" and \\"Ocean\\". Artistry =Voice= Goldfrapp has an expansive soprano vocal range. She is noted for her operatic abilities, particularly on the group's debut album Felt Mountain and prominently on the songs \\"Utopia\\" and \\"Pilots\\". Her delivery in a more contemporary voice has been described as \\"breathy\\", \\"sultry\\", \\"ethereal\\" and \\"startling\\". Goldfrapp performing as part of the Wireless Festival, London 2006 Goldfrapp has been commended for her vocal versatility, morphing her voice to fit various genres such as folk, pop, classical, dance, trip hop and electronica throughout her career. Goldfrapp has used a vocoder to modify her voice to fit the material she is singing, such as the song \\"Lovely Head\\". Vocally, Goldfrapp has been compared to Marlene Dietrich, Siouxsie Sioux, Bj√∂rk, Kate Bush and the Cocteau Twins. =Compositions= Goldfrapp produces and writes most of her material alongside bandmate Will Gregory. She draws inspiration from a range of artists and musical genres. As a teenager she listened to Kate Bush, T. Rex, Donna Summer, Joan Jett, Marc Bolan, David Cassidy, and Iggy Pop and The Stooges, and discovered Serge Gainsbourg while working in Belgium. While travelling through Europe in the early 1990s, she began listening to Polish disco music and cabaret music from the Weimar Republic. Other media, including film, have influenced Goldfrapp who cites Roman Polanski's 1966 psychological thriller Cul-de-sac, the 1973 cult film The Wicker Man and the James Bond franchise as influences. She draws inspiration from surrealism and nature, all of which appear in Goldfrapp's album artwork, which she designs in collaboration with Big Active. Goldfrapp believes that \\"music is a visual experience\\" and therefore visualises her lyrics before writing them. While writing, Goldfrapp uses her vocals to create melodies and drumbeats. Her songwriting is characterised by its use of animals to describe human emotions and status. Public image While touring in 2004, sections of the group's stage show featured Goldfrapp in a white dress wearing a horse tail and dancers with deer heads, which were inspired by her interest in animals and mythology. The artwork for Goldfrapp's album Seventh Tree featured her dressed as a Pierrot. Her new image, inspired by paganism, featured her dressed in white or natural- coloured flowing gowns with loose curly blonde hair. During 2010, Goldfrapp took on several new images to fit with their forthcoming album Head First. The music on this album was more '80s-influenced, reflected in the artwork featured on the album's first single, \\"Rocket\\", which features Goldfrapp in a pink jumpsuit. For their live shows, she wore spangly black leggings and a jacket covered in VHS tape which was blown about by two electric fans placed at front centre-stage. The shine of the plastic reflected the colourful stage lighting. In 2013, Goldfrapp was invited by The Lowry, Salford to curate an exhibition as part of their ‚ÄòPerformer as Curator‚Äô annual series. The exhibition was a collection of photography and paintings inspired by ideas of metamorphosis and fairytales.  Personal life  Goldfrapp confirmed she was dating film editor Lisa Gunning in a February 2010 interview with The Sunday Times saying, \\"I think of everything as being about a person and a relationship, and I am in a wonderful relationship with a wonderful person. It just happens to be with a lady... It's something I've thought about for a long time and it concurs with my philosophy on life and sexuality. I don't think it can or should be pigeonholed. I've thought about this since I was a teenager. I've always found it claustrophobic to think about having to put things into categories like that. My sexuality is the same as my music and my life. Why does it need a label?\\" All of Goldfrapp's relationships before this were with men. Goldfrapp is dyslexic.

Japanese holdouts either doubted the veracity of the formal surrender, rejected demobilization for ideological reasons, or were simply not aware because communications had been cut off by Allied advances. Some continued to fight enemy forces and local police, or volunteered with local independence movements such as the First Indochina War and Indonesian National Revolution, for years after the war was over. Many holdouts were discovered in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands over the following decades, with the last one, Private Teruo Nakamura, surrendering on Morotai Island in Indonesia in December 1974. Newspapers reported holdouts into the early 1980s and said searches had been conducted several times over the decades, but the information was too scant to take further action. Since the 1990s a number of holdouts have been allegedly spotted, which some investigators believe to be stories invented by local residents to attract Japanese tourists. History =1945‚Äì1949= Second Lieutenant Sakae ≈åba, a Japanese holdout in 1937. * Captain Sakae ≈åba, who led his company of 46 men in guerrilla actions against United States troops following the Battle of Saipan, did not surrender until December 1, 1945, three months after the war ended. * On January 1, 1946, 20 Japanese Army personnel who had been hiding in a tunnel at Corregidor Island surrendered to a US serviceman after learning the war had ended from a newspaper found while collecting water. * Lieutenant Ei Yamaguchi and his 33 soldiers emerged on Peleliu in late March 1947, attacking the U.S. Marine Corps detachment stationed on the island believing the war was still being fought. Reinforcements were sent in, along with a Japanese admiral who was able to convince them the war was over. They finally surrendered in April 1947. * On May 12, 1948, the Associated Press reported that two Japanese soldiers surrendered to civilian policemen in Guam the day before. * On January 6, 1949, Yamakage Kufuku and Matsudo Linsoki, two Imperial Japanese Navy machine gunners, surrendered on Iwo Jima. =1950s= * Private 1st Class Y≈´ichi Akatsu continued to fight on Lubang Island in the Philippines from 1944 until surrendering in the village of Looc in March 1950. * On June 27, 1951, the Associated Press reported that a Japanese petty officer who surrendered on Anatahan Island in the Marianas two weeks before said that there were 18 other holdouts there. A U.S. Navy plane that flew over the island spotted 18 Japanese soldiers on a beach waving white flags. However, the Navy remained cautious, as the Japanese petty officer had warned that the soldiers were \\"well-armed and that some of them threatened to kill anyone who tried to give himself up.

Elbaite forms three series, with dravite, with fluor-liddicoatite, and with schorl. Due to these series, specimens with the ideal endmember formula are not found occurring naturally. As a gemstone, elbaite is a desirable member of the tourmaline group because of the variety and depth of its colours and quality of the crystals. Originally discovered on the island of Elba, Italy in 1913, it has since been found in many parts of the world. In 1994, a major locality was discovered in Canada, at O'Grady Lakes in the Yukon. Elbaite forms in igneous and metamorphic rocks and veins in association with lepidolite, microcline, and spodumene in granite pegmatites; with andalusite and biotite in schist; and with molybdenite and cassiterite in massive hydrothermal replacement deposits. Elbaite is allochromatic, meaning trace amounts of impurities can tint crystals, and it can be strongly pleochroic. Every color of the rainbow may be represented by elbaite, some exhibiting multicolor zonation. Microscopic acicular inclusions in some elbaite crystals show the Cat's eye effect in polished cabochons.

The signal reaches across the Adelaide metropolitan area to the Mid North, the Yorke Peninsula and Fleurieu Peninsula, the southern Barossa, Kangaroo Island, Riverland and parts of the Eyre Peninsula broadcasting at 13 kilowatts on 101.5 MHz FM. The transmitter power was only 7 kW until an upgrade on 2 November 2006. Radio Adelaide was formerly known as 5UV, denoting its links to the University of Adelaide, the university where the radio station was originally located and started. The radio station was renamed Radio Adelaide in 2002 to coincide with its transfer from AM to FM band, following the ABA Licence Area Plans for Adelaide finding an available frequency on 101.5 FM. Radio Adelaide is highly autonomous despite technically being owned by the University of Adelaide until 2016, when the university sold the radio station premises and transferred the broadcast licence to Educational Broadcasters Adelaide Inc (EBA). The station is run by over five hundred volunteer station workers as well as a small amount of paid staff. Because Radio Adelaide is a community radio station, there are many program styles including comedy, music, etc. Because of this, Radio Adelaide uses strip programming to ensure some consistency and coherency. Programs on Radio Adelaide are provided by volunteers and also by access groups who pay for on air time. The largest purchaser of access time was \\"Student Radio\\" a collection of Radio Programs provided by university students from the University of Adelaide, Flinders University and the University of South Australia. After the introduction of Voluntary Student Unionism the hours which Student Radio broadcasts have been reduced, making the \\"Roundabout\\" program the largest purchaser of access time. Radio Adelaide collaborates with community radio stations 2SER Sydney and 4EB Brisbane to contribute content to the national current affairs radio programme The Wire by co-ordinating, resourcing and developing stories. Radio Adelaide was a Registered Training Organisation providing nationally accredited training and in 1999 won Adult Learning Australia's Outstanding Training Provider of the Year Award. Radio Adelaide has audio production facilities available including recording, mastering, duplication, online audio, digital transfer, message on hold, equipment hire and expert technical advice. 600px History Radio Adelaide at its temporary studios shared with Fresh FM in the East End precinct. In 1970, Kenneth Stirling, an accountant who worked for a mining company, anonymously donated $100,000 to the University of Adelaide to establish an educational community radio station. It was an idea being developed by key people at the University interested in broadening access to education, but it was also an innovative and creative leap, as there were not any such stations in Australia. Stirling died in 1973 and his anonymous donation became public. When 5UV opened in 1972, it had a special one-off licence, but the momentum for community access to broadcasting was happening nationally and it became a ‚Äòpublic radio‚Äô licence in 1974 along with a further 11 stations all in other Australian states. Stirling's donation gave 5UV Radio Adelaide a special place as the first station in Australia‚Äôs very diverse community radio sector. In 1972, the newly created 5UV radio station began broadcasting in small rooms under the former Hughes Plaza, now the Hub Central, on the University of Adelaide campus. The University of Adelaide purchased the site on 228 North Terrace in the mid 1980s and Radio Adelaide's relocation was managed by its 1984 Station Manager Jill Lambert, with the new studios being built from 1988 and opened in April 1989. In 1972, Radio Adelaide (named 5UV at the time), began broadcasting on AM 531 band, then on 101.5 FM band as Radio Adelaide in 2002 and then on digital radio from 2011. In December 2003, following 18 months of planning and fundraising, Radio Adelaide launched its new antenna to take maximum advantage of its 101.5 FM frequency. In 2014, the University of Adelaide's Vice-Chancellor Warren Bebbington announced changes to the funding model and location of Radio Adelaide to invest in other projects and its new Medical School. In June 2015, the University of Adelaide sold the station's studios at 228 North Terrace and the staff and volunteers were told to move by mid 2016. In December 2015, the University of Adelaide released a discussion paper to invite briefings from key stakeholders regarding the future of Radio Adelaide which included shutting down Radio Adelaide, ending 43 years of broadcasting and partnership with the University of Adelaide. Following the announcement that Radio Adelaide may face closure, the station's staff and volunteers began a grassroots campaign online and via social media to ensure the station's future. A week later, the University of Adelaide announced it will inform the station's staff and volunteers of Radio Adelaide's future in early January 2016 after the University released a Registration of Interest document seeking potential owners for Radio Adelaide, with a closing date of 24 December 2015. The University of Adelaide scheduled a meeting with the station's staff in late January 2016 but cancelled at the last minute citing \\"The assessment of short-listed bidders for Radio Adelaide is not yet complete.\\" On 18 February 2016, the University of Adelaide signed a deal with community radio station Fresh FM 92.7 to help operate and manage the station to become an independent not-for-profit organisation from July 2016. Under the new agreement with Fresh FM, Radio Adelaide will retain its educational mission and will initially co-locate with Fresh 92.7 in their Rundle Street Studios with a view to moving to new studios in the future. The transfer of the broadcasting licence from the University to a new entity cannot be finalised until approved by the broadcasting authority ACMA. It remains unclear how much of Radio Adelaide's current facilities and capacity will be retained in the shift, as Radio Adelaide's schedule tended to be eclectic with a mix of ethnically diverse programming, access groups, education and arts coverage. In March 2016, a group of Radio Adelaide station workers and volunteers formed a body named RadAd Station Workers Association (RASWA) to represent the broader station community and to provide public comment on recent developments regarding the station's future due to a continued gag placed on paid station staff. In May 2016, former Liberal MP Iain Evans was appointed the Chairman of the new Radio Adelaide board. Other board members included lawyer Andrea Michaels, and station representatives Charlotte Bedford and Nikki Marcel. Radio Adelaide continued broadcasting during the transition to their temporary studios shared with Fresh 92.7, with automated programming for three weeks until Radio Adelaide's relaunch in late July 2016. In June 2016, former television and radio sports broadcaster Rob Popplestone was appointed as Radio Adelaide's new General Manager with Joanna Chronis joining the new Radio Adelaide board and station representatives Charlotte Bedford and Nikki Marcel stepping down. In July 2016, Popplestone announced the station's jazz and classical weekday morning programming would be axed and the new Radio Adelaide's launch postponed until early August due to delays in studio construction in Adelaide's East End. The RadAd Station Workers Association (RASWA) raised concerns about the announcement regarding the management's failure to comply with the station's licence obligations by not involving volunteers in the decision-making process. RASWA emphasised it is a legal obligation for community radio stations to encourage community access and participation in all aspects of station operations, from programming to management. On 1 August 2016, Radio Adelaide returned to live broadcasting at the new studios shared with Fresh FM on 3 Cinema Place in Adelaide's East End. On 1 December 2016, Radio Adelaide received short notice that 891 ABC Adelaide would be renamed \\"ABC Radio Adelaide\\" as part of the national broadcaster's rebranding strategy for all its radio stations in January 2017. Radio Adelaide's chairman Iain Evans accused the ABC of attempting to steal Radio Adelaide's name. Radio Adelaide's lawyer Andrea Michaels sent a legal notice to the ABC and submitted a trademark application to secure the stand-alone name 'Radio Adelaide' as the radio station already had claims to the name as a registered trademark and under common law. ABC local content manager Graeme Bennett argued there will be no confusion as the two radio stations have different audiences and it made sense to drop the call sign \\"891\\" from the branding as most people listen to digital radio that automatically tunes to the radio station. On 14 December 2016, Radio Adelaide took the ABC to the federal court and sought a temporary injunction against the ABC in using the name \\"ABC Radio Adelaide\\" for 891 ABC Adelaide. On 19 December 2016, the broadcasting authority ACMA announced its approval of the transfer of Radio Adelaide's licence to Educational Broadcasters Adelaide Inc (EBA), and the University of Adelaide had 90 days to transfer the licence to EBA. The ACMA was satisfied with the written assurance from the University of Adelaide and the EBA to develop and provide a community consultation strategy and structured engagement programme to be implemented by 1 March 2017. In late December, the Federal Court granted Radio Adelaide a temporary injunction until April 2017 against ABC renaming 891 ABC Adelaide to ABC Radio Adelaide. On 9 January 2017, 891 ABC Adelaide celebrated with its temporary new name ABC Adelaide as its interstate counterparts converted to ABC Radio Darwin, ABC Radio Brisbane etc. Adelaide University Student Radio Adelaide University Student Radio (AUSR) is an access group at Radio Adelaide and is funded by Adelaide University Union. It is the oldest student radio program in Australia, having been broadcasting since 1975. AUSR suffered severe funding cuts since the introduction of Voluntary Student Unionism legislation with weekly hours being cut from nine to three, before being increased to six and then seven in 2016. Local Noise, a live local band show, was the flagship of AUSR until 2007 when it was decided that funding was insufficient to maintain it and it was handed over to Radio Adelaide. Local Noise now broadcasts every weekday between 9am and noon showcasing Adelaide bands, as well as Australian bands touring to Adelaide soon. Adelaide University Student Radio previously aired Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights from 11pm-1am, but as of 2016 broadcasts 6pm-1am on Friday nights. The current student radio broadcast schedule can be found at the Radio Adelaide Website. Student Radio is overseen by up to three Student Radio Directors, who must be members of the Adelaide University Union and are elected during the annual Union elections.

All shows were solely hosted by students from Flinders University.

They were then modified by Appledore Shipbuilders to take the strains of a full sailing rig and to improve their sailing properties, including the addition of a new deeper keel holding fifty tons of ballast. 's rig was designed according to traditional rules and is occasionally modified slightly with trainees in mind. The foremast is slightly shorter than the main mast, but they are otherwise identical. Each consists of a steel lower mast and topmast and timber topgallant and royal mast. Spars are steel on the lower and topmasts (course, lower topsail and upper topsail yards) and timber above this (topgallant and royal yards). Access to the tops is by a vertical \\"jacob's ladder\\" down to the ratlines, rather than inverted futtock shrouds. There is a gold sovereign placed under the foremast where it meets the keel, a tradition supposed to give the ship luck. The accommodation for voyage crew (i.e. ordinary paying crew members) is in six eight-berth cabins, two for each watch. Volunteers are in 2-3 berth cabins and the permanent crew have individual cabins. The accommodation is air-conditioned, because the ship spends a significant amount of time in tropical waters each year. The first sighting of Excelsior as Prince William closed to offer assistance during the 2005 Tall Ships' Race to Norway. Prince William competed in the 2005 Tall Ships' Races. She came fourth in class (of 25) and fourth overall (of 100+) in the first race from Waterford to Cherbourg. In the second race, from Newcastle to Fredrikstad, she suspended racing in order to answer a distress call from another vessel, the Lowestoft trawler Excelsior, which was in danger of losing her mast and sinking. The Prince William, which is registered as a UK Auxiliary Coastguard vessel, stood by Excelsior in case of disaster, supplied a portable pump via RIB in large seas, and accompanied her into Fredrikstad in case of further damage. Prince William was listed as \\"retired\\" by the race authorities, but was awarded a prize for her actions. Prince William completed her final voyage with the TSYT in 2007; its 6th Brig Match Race in Portsmouth, 29 October ‚Äì 1 November 2007, competing alongside sister ship; Stavros S Niarchos. With bright sunny skies and freshening winds, the two majestic brigs battled it out over a series of four races on courses set towards Cowes on the first day and Sandown Bay on the Isle of Wight on the second. In the end, Captain Liam Keating on Stavros S Niarchos took home the Tall Ships Challenge Cup having closely beaten Captain Roy Love on Prince William 2‚Äì1 (one race abandoned due to light winds). Sale in 2010 In 2007 the trustees of the TSYT decided to sell Prince William and she was laid up in Portsmouth Dockyard and later at Hull. Following interest from the Pakistan Navy, her sale was completed on 20 September 2010.

Anderson, Jr. (July 9, 1926 ‚Äì October 22, 2015) was an American comics artist, known as one of the premier inkers of his era, who worked for companies such as DC Comics for over fifty years, starting in the Golden Age of Comic Books in the 1940s. He worked on such characters as Hawkman, Batgirl, Zatanna, the Spectre, and Superman, as well as on the Buck Rogers daily syndicated newspaper comic strip. Anderson also contributed for many years to PS, the preventive maintenance comics magazine of the U.S. Army. Early life and career Murphy Anderson was born on July 9, 1926, in Asheville, North Carolina, and while in grade school moved with his family to Greensboro, North Carolina. After graduating high school in 1943, he briefly attended the University of North Carolina before moving to New York City seeking work in the comics industry, and was hired by Jack Byrne as a staff artist at the comic-book publisher Fiction House. His first confirmed credit is the two-and- two-thirds-page nonfiction aviation featurette \\"Jet Propulsion\\" in Wings Comics #48 (cover-dated Aug. 1944), and his first fiction feature was an eight-page \\"Suicide Smith and the Air Commanders\\" story in Wings Comics #50 (Oct. 1944). By the following month he was the regular artist on the Planet Comics features \\"Life on Other Worlds\\" and \\"Star Pirate\\". Anderson continued doing comics work, as well as illustrations for science-fiction pulp magazines, during his stateside postings while serving in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1945. From 1947 to 1949, Anderson was the artist on the Buck Rogers comic-book series. During the 1950s, Anderson worked for several publishers including Pines Comics, St. John Publications, Ziff Davis, DC Comics, and Atlas Comics, that decade's predecessor of Marvel Comics. \\"Star Pirate\\" splash page, Planet Comics #50 (Sept. 1947), penciled and inked by Anderson Anderson succeeded artist and co-creator Carmine Infantino on the superhero feature \\"Captain Comet\\" beginning with the story \\"The Girl from the Diamond Planet\\" in Strange Adventures #12 (cover-dated Sept. 1951). Years later, Anderson and writer John Broome created the feature \\"Atomic Knights\\" in Strange Adventures #117 (June 1960), which Anderson later described as his favorite assignment. Anderson and writer Gardner Fox launched the Hawkman series in May 1964McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 113 and introduced the Zatanna character in issue #4 (Nov. 1964).McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 112 Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \\"Hawkman really took off when artist Murphy Anderson took over...Anderson came into his own with his elegantly ornamental version of the Winged Wonder.\\" The Spectre was revived by Fox and Anderson in Showcase #60 (Feb. 1966)McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 117: \\"Scribe Gardner Fox and artist Murphy Anderson recruited the ethereal entity in time for #60 of Showcase.\\" and was given his own series in December 1967.McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 125 In the 1960s Anderson proposed that comics pages be drawn at 10x15 inches rather than the prevailing standard of 12x18 inches, which allowed two pages to be photographed at the same time, and this subsequently became the industry standard. Anderson designed the costume of Adam Strange. With his frequent collaborator, penciler Curt Swan, the pair's artwork on Superman and Action Comics in the 1970s came to be called \\"Swanderson\\" by fans. He often hid his initials somewhere within the stories he inked. In the early 1970s, DC assigned Anderson, among other artists, to redraw the heads of Jack Kirby's renditions of Superman and Jimmy Olsen, fearing Kirby's versions were too different from the established images of the characters. In 1972, he drew Wonder Woman for the cover of the first issue of Ms. Magazine. In 1973, he established Murphy Anderson Visual Concepts, which provided color separations and lettering for comic books. Anderson also contributed for many years to PS, the preventive maintenance comics magazine of the U.S. Army. Personal life Anderson and his wife of 67 years, Helen, had two daughters, Sophie and Mary, and a son, Murphy III. Anderson died in Somerset, New Jersey on October 22, 2015, at the age of 89, of heart failure.. Note: DC Comics gives death date as October 23 in  Awards  Anderson's accolades include the 1962 Alley Award for \\"Best Inker\\"; a 1963 Alley for \\"Artist Preferred on Justice League of America\\"; 1964 Alleys for \\"Best Inking Artist\\" and for \\"Best Comic Book Cover\\" (Detective Comics #329, with penciler Carmine Infantino); 1965 Alleys for, again, \\"Best Inking Artist\\" and \\"Best Comic Book Cover\\" (The Brave and the Bold #61), as well as for \\"Best Novel\\" (an untitled story in Showcase #55, with writer Gardner Fox). Anderson received an Inkpot Award in 1984 and was inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1998 the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 1999, and the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame in 2013.

He captained the Indian cricket team at the first two cricket world cups, and later became an umpire on the elite International Cricket Council Test panel. His Test career was one of the longest for any Indian player. He also played for Derbyshire in English county cricket from 1973 to 1975. A qualified engineer and an alumnus of Chennai's famed College of Engineering, Guindy, he is a recipient of the civilian honour of Padma Shri. Playing career An off spin bowler, he was one of the famed Indian quartet of spin bowlers in the 1970s (the others being Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Bishan Singh Bedi and Erapalli Prasanna). He was also a useful tail-end batsman and strong at close fielding. Venkat came on to the Test scene at the age of 20 when he was selected to play against the touring New Zealand side. By the end of the series he had emerged as a world-class spinner, taking 12 wickets in the Delhi test that led India to victory. He was the vice-captain of the Indian team that toured the West Indies and England in 1970‚Äì71. India won both series. Venkat played an important role, claiming five wickets in the Trinidad Test and 13 wickets in the three Tests in England. He captained India in both the 1975 and 1979 World Cup competitions. He also led India in a four- Test series against England in 1979. In domestic cricket, he led South Zone and Tamil Nadu for over a decade. Venkat retired from first-class cricket in 1985. He became a cricket administrator and managed the Indian Test side. He was honoured with the Padma Shri in 2003.  Umpiring career  Venkat made his international umpiring debut in the One Day International between India and England at Jaipur on 18 January 1993. He made his Test umpiring debut in the same month, with the match between India and England at Kolkata. He gained a place on the inaugural International Umpire Panel when it was formed in 1994, and was selected by the International Cricket Council on a regular basis to umpire in Test matches away from home as the neutral umpire. In 2002 the ICC created an Elite Panel of the top eight umpires, who were employed on a full-time basis and would cover all Test match officiating. Venkat was duly included in the inaugural Elite Panel, of which he remained a member until his retirement in January 2004. The highlights of his umpiring career include six Ashes Tests and appointments to three World Cups in 1996, 1999 and 2003. In both the 1996 and 1999 tournaments he was appointed to stand in a semi-final, and was the third umpire of the 1999 World Cup final between Australia and Pakistan at Lord's. In total he officiated on-field in 73 Test matches and 52 One-day Internationals during his career. Education Venkataraghavan is an engineering graduate from Madras University.

Hell money () is a form of joss paper printed to resemble legal tender bank notes. The notes are not an official form of recognized currency or legal tender since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a solution to resolve their assumed monetary problems in the afterlife. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century. Early 20th century examples bore resemblance to minor commercial currency of the type issued by businesses across China until the mid-1940s.Smith, Ward & Matravers, Brian (1970). Chinese Banknotes, p.144. Shirjieh Publishers, Menlo Park, California The identification of this type of joss paper as \\"hell bank notes\\" or \\"hell money\\" is largely a Western construct, since these items are simply regarded as yet another form of joss paper ( or ) in East Asian cultures and have no special name or status. The name \\"hell\\" The word hell on hell bank notes refers to Diyu (, \\"underworld prison\\"; also , d√¨f«î, \\"underworld court\\"). These words are printed on some notes. In traditional Chinese belief, it is thought to be where the souls of the dead are first judged by the Lord of the Earthly Court, Yama (Yanluo Wang). After this particular judgment, they are either escorted to heaven or sent into the maze of underworld levels and chambers to atone for their sins. People believe that even in the earthly court, spirits need to use money.World Paper Money A popular anecdote claims that the word hell was introduced to China by Christian missionaries, who preached that all non-Christian Chinese people would go to hell after death. The word \\"Hell\\" was thus misinterpreted to be the proper English term for the afterlife, and was thusly adopted as such. Some printed notes attempt to correct this by omitting the word \\"hell\\" and sometimes replacing it with \\"heaven\\" or \\"paradise\\". These particular bills are usually found in joss packs meant to be burned for Chinese deities, and are usually differently colored but have the same design as hell bank notes. Designs Earlier examples of these notes were issued in denominations of 5 and 10 yuan and upwards, with such amounts being considered adequate until inflation took hold within China from 1944. The soaring denominations of authentic currency was soon reflected in that issued for the afterlife, and after 1945 the majority of Hell banknotes were issued in denominations of $10,000 or higher. These earlier issues more commonly depict landscape scenes, temples or trains, and the numerous varieties may literally number into the millions.Smith, Ward & Matravers, Brian (1970). Chinese Banknotes, p.144-145. Shirjieh Publishers, Menlo Park, California Modern Hell bank notes are known for their large denominations, ranging from $10,000 to several billions. The obverse usually bears an effigy of the Jade Emperor, the presiding monarch of heaven in Taoism, and the countersignature of Yanluo, King of Hell (). There is usually an image of the \\"Bank of Hell\\" on the reverse of the notes. A commonly sold Hell bank note is the $10,000 note that is styled after the old United States Federal Reserve Note. The obverse contains, apart from the portrait of the Jade Emperor, the seal of the Bank of Hell consisting of a picture of the bank itself. Many tiny, faint \\"Hell Bank Note\\"s are scattered on the back in yellow. These are sold in packs of 50 to 150, and are wrapped in cellophane. Stores that specialize in selling ritual items, such as the religious goods stores in Malaysia, also sell larger and elaborately decorated notes that have a larger denomination than the usual $10,000 note. Some bills do not portray the Jade Emperor, and portray other famous figures from Chinese mythology instead, such as the Eight Immortals, the Buddha, Yama, or images of dragons. Some even portray famous people who are deceased, such as US President John F. Kennedy, Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe.  Customs  When burning the notes, the notes are placed as a loose bundle, in a manner considered respectful. Alternatively, in some customs, each bank note may be folded in a specific way before being tossed into the fire because of the belief that burning real money brings bad luck. While the custom of burning \\"hell bank notes\\" remains legal in China, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has as of 2006 banned the practice of \\"vulgar\\" burned offerings for the deceased. According to the Ministry, the ban on offerings such as paper \\"luxury villas, sedan cars, mistresses, and other messy sacrificial items\\" was part of an effort to eradicate \\"feudal\\" and superstitious behavior.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-04/25/content_576881.htm See also * Ancestor worship * Ghost Festival * Joss paper * Religious goods store * Charon's obol * Lucky money References * Smith, Ward & Matravers, Brian (1970).

He is today chiefly known for creating the comic book characters Airboy and Steel Sterling, and for his work at Lev Gleason Publications on Daredevil Comics and Crime Does Not Pay. Biography A New York native, Charles Biro graduated from Stuyvesant High School before studying art at the Brooklyn Museum School of Art and the Grand Central School of Art. He joined the Harry \\"A\\" Chesler Shop c. 1936.Bails, Jerry G. and Hames Ware (ed.s), The Who's Who of American Comic Books: Volume One, p. 31 (Bails, 1973) Working in the multiple roles of writer, artist and later supervisor at one of the earliest comics packaging art studios, Biro moved from the Chesler Shop in 1939 to take up similar roles at MLJ Comics. Biro worked as artistic supervisor (as well as writer and artist) for MLJ until 1941, writing and drawing such characters as Steel Sterling (a character he created)Brancatelli, Joe \\"Biro, Charles (1911-1972)\\" in Maurice Horn (ed.), The World Encyclopedia of Comics (Chelsea House Publishers, 2nd ed., 1999) , pp. 134-135 and Sgt. Boyle, before moving to Lev Gleason Publications, for whom he would work for the next 15 years. While working for Gleason, Biro held the roles of editorial director, head writer and cover artist. According to comics historians Jerry Bails and Hames Ware, Biro did not do much, if any, interior artwork after 1942, focusing solely on covers. For Gleason, he produced a number of titles, among them (with Bob Wood) Chuck \\"Crimebuster\\" Chandler, who appeared in Boy Comics (1942‚Äì1956). Chandler is described by Joe Brancatelli as \\"a hero, yes, but first a boy... arguably the best-handled boy's adventure feature ever to appear in comics.\\" Later, he marketed \\"the first full adult comic book, Tops, a 1949 experiment in full color and standard magazine size\\" (which lasted two issues, July and September 1949). =Daredevil= Although Biro's most important work for Gleason was arguably in the nascent genre of crime comics (below), he is perhaps more widely known, however, for his lengthy work on one of Gleason's longest-running titles, producing a landmark run on the first hero to take the name Daredevil (no relation to the Marvel Comics character of the same name). Although primarily by this point in his career a writer and cover artist, Biro drew much of the first issue of Daredevil Comics (the character had launched in the pages of Silver Streak #6 (September 1940)) titled Daredevil Battles Hitler #1 (July 1941). Biro would stay with the title for the rest of his time working for Gleason, and make the character one of the most acclaimed of the Golden Age. The title is described as: Joe Brancatelli, in Maurice Horn's The World Encyclopedia of Comics (2nd ed.) described the pre-Biro Daredevil as \\"Gleason's top seller and a fine superhero concept in its own right... created by Don Rico and Jack Binder\\", swiftly taken over by Biro, who then performed a \\"miraculous job\\" with the title, through which his \\"real talent became known.\\" The Lambiek Comiclopedia similarly calls Biro's \\"guiding of 'Daredevil'\\" \\"[o]ne of his most impressive feats.\\"Charles Biro at Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed August 29, 2008 Biro was joined by writer-artist Basil Wolverton and Dick Briefer in Daredevil Comics. In issue #13 (October 1942) Biro introduced the \\"Little Wise Guys,\\" echoing such junior characters as the Jack Kirby-created Newsboy Legion for DC Comics. The Wise Guys comprised Curly, Jocko, Peewee, Scarecrow and Meatball, with Meatball meeting an early death‚Äî\\"a rare moment in comics of the days.\\" By the late 1940s, with superheroes going out of fashion, the Little Wise Guys took center stage, and \\"Daredevil unmasked and became a mentor to the kids, who eventually pushed the title character out of his own comic book.\\" After writing the adventures of Daredevil between 1941 and 1950, with issue #70 (January 1950), Biro continued to write \\"Little Wise Guys\\" stories until the series ended with issue #134 (September 1956). =Other work= Among his work for other companies, was the comic strip Goodbyland in 1938, and \\"Block & Fall\\" for Centaur Comics (1938). He produced work for Henle and Fiction House in the mid to late 1930s and co-created the character of Airboy for Hillman Periodicals in 1941. Debuting in the second issue of Air Fighters Comics (November 1942), Airboy (with artist Al Camy and scripter Dick Wood) was to be one of Biro's most enduring creations, and has been resurrected several times since the character's demise (with Hillman) in 1953, after a run of over 100 issues, during which time Air Fighters Comics was renamed Airboy Comics (December 1945).Miller, J. J., Thompson, Maggie, Peter Bickford and Frankenhoff, Brent, The Comic Buyer's Guide Standard Catalog of Comic Books, 4th Edition (KP Books, 2005) - \\"Airboy Comics\\"; \\"Air Fighters Comics\\", pp. 68-69 In October 1955, he wrote and illustrated the first of around 13The 13th issue of Poppo (released in the third week of January, 1956) is thought to be the final issue, as per: Miller, J. J., Thompson, Maggie, Peter Bickford and Frankenhoff, Brent, The Comic Buyer's Guide Standard Catalog of Comic Books, 4th Edition (KP Books, 2005) - \\"Poppo of the Popcorn Theatre\\", p. 1066 issues of a weekly humor book entitled Poppo of the Popcorn Theatre for Fuller, which was \\"virtually ignored.\\" Legacy =Crime comics= For Lev Gleason, Biro helped to create the Crime comics genre with the landmark title Crime Does Not Pay (1942‚Äì1955), which he edited along with Bob Wood.Miller, J. J., Thompson, Maggie, Peter Bickford and Frankenhoff, Brent, The Comic Buyer's Guide Standard Catalog of Comic Books, 4th Edition (KP Books, 2005) - \\"Crime Does Not Pay\\", pp. 366-367 The title had an instant effect on the marketplace, and is described in The Comic Buyer's Guide Standard Catalog of Comic Books as \\"the comic book that got the entire crime comics genre rolling‚Äîand may have unwittingly contributed to the formation of the Comics Code years later.\\" \\"Usually regarded as the comic book industry's first crime title,\\" the series started with Crime Does Not Pay #22 (July 1942), carrying on the numbering from Silver Streak Comics #21. The landmark title was the result of bar talk between Biro and Wood (both alumni of the Harry \\"A\\" Chesler ShopNicky Wright \\"Seducers of the Innocent\\". Accessed August 29, 2008), who worked together regularly. Part of \\"the allure of the series\\" was due to Biro's narrator, \\"Mr. Crime\\" (a prototype for the more famous EC Comics \\"GhouLunatic\\" trio). The series immediately spawned a plethora of imitators, but \\"[t]hroughout its run, Crime Does Not Pay was always the best-written, best-illustrated, and best- edited crime title, and it was always the best-selling title, as well.\\" Although it can arguably be said to have been a major factor in the comics witchhunts of the 1950s, it is fair to note that it stood apart from its more tawdry imitators: Indeed, Brancatelli claims that \\"for several years during the late 1940s and early 1950s, Boy, Daredevil and Crime Does Not Pay [all Biro-edited and -written titles, largely under Biro covers] were the three best-selling titles in a comic field of over 400 competitors.\\" Later life and career After parting company with Gleason in 1956, Biro \\"left the field for television,\\" moving into the field of graphic design. He was employed for the last ten years of his life by NBC as a graphic artist between 1962 and 1972. During the late 1960s, he became curious about a comic book convention and walked from NBC over to the convention hotel. When convention staffers realized who he was, he was handed a microphone and spoke spontaneously about his career for 20 minutes. He died on 4 March 1972, and was nominated for induction into the Eisner Hall of Fame in both 1998 and 2000, before being formally inducted in 2002.

MacIntyre provides a bleak view of the state of modern moral discourse, regarding it as failing to be rational, and failing to admit to being irrational. He claims that older forms of moral discourse were in better shape, particularly singling out Aristotle's moral philosophy as an exemplar. After Virtue is among the most important texts in the recent revival of virtue ethics. The book was first published in 1981 and has since gone through two subsequent editions, which have added to, but not changed, the original text. The second edition, published in 1984, adds a postscript replying to critics of the first edition; the third edition, published in 2007, contains a new prologue entitled \\"After Virtue After a Quarter of a Century\\". Summary MacIntyre holds that After Virtue makes seven central claims.Alasdair MacIntyre, \\"The Claims of After Virtue\\", in Kelvin Knight (ed.), The MacIntyre Reader (University of Notre Dame Press, 1998), 69-72. It begins with an allegory suggestive of the premise of the science-fiction novel A Canticle for Leibowitz: a world where all sciences have been dismantled quickly and almost entirely. MacIntyre asks what the sciences would look like if they were re- assembled from the remnants of scientific knowledge that survived the catastrophe. He claims that the new sciences, though superficially similar to the old, would in fact be devoid of real scientific content, because the key suppositions and attitudes would not be present. \\"The hypothesis which I wish to advance,\\" he continues, \\"is that in the actual world which we inhabit the language of morality is in the same state of grave disorder as the language of natural science in the imaginary world which I described.\\"Alasdair MacIntyre, After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory (University of Notre Dame Press, 1984, 2nd edn.), 2. Specifically, MacIntyre applies this hypothesis to advance the notion that the moral structures that emerged from the Enlightenment were philosophically doomed from the start because they were formed using the aforementioned incoherent language of morality. MacIntyre claims that this failure encompasses the work of many significant Enlightenment and post- Enlightenment moral philosophers, including S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Karl Marx, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume. These philosophers \\"fail because of certain shared characteristics deriving from their highly specific historical background.\\" That background is the Enlightenment's abandonment of Aristotelianism, and in particular the Aristotelian concept of teleology. Ancient and medieval ethics, argues MacIntyre, relied wholly on the teleological idea that human life had a proper end or character, and that human beings could not reach this natural end without preparation. Renaissance science rejected Aristotle's teleological physics as an incorrect and unnecessary account, which led Renaissance philosophy to make a similar rejection in the realm of ethics. But shorn of teleology, ethics as a body of knowledge was expurgated of its central content, and only remained as, essentially, a vocabulary list with few definitions and no context. With such an incomplete framework on which to base their moral understanding, the philosophers of the Enlightenment and their successors were doomed from the beginning. MacIntyre illustrates this point through an example of a people who, he argues, experienced a similar incoherence in their own moral and ethical tradition: the Polynesian people of the South Pacific and their taboos. King Kamehameha II removed the taboos of the people in order to modernize their society and met little if any resistance. The Polynesians had no issue with abandoning their long-standing cultural traditions and MacIntyre claims this is because the taboos, though once meaningful to the islanders, had been shorn over the centuries of their underlying spiritual and didactic purpose, becoming a set of arbitrary prohibitions. The fact that Kamehameha II could abolish them so easily and without opposition is evidence, MacIntyre argues, of their incoherence. A similar incoherence, he argues, bedevils the ethical project since the Enlightenment. Another reason MacIntyre gives for the doomed nature of the Enlightenment is the fact that it ascribed moral agency to the individual. He claims this made morality no more than one man's opinion and, thus, philosophy became a forum of inexplicably subjective rules and principles. The failure of the Enlightenment Project, because of the abandonment of a teleological structure, is shown by the inadequacy of moral emotivism, which MacIntyre believes accurately reflects the state of modern morality. MacIntyre offers a critique of Friedrich Nietzsche, whom he calls the \\"King Kamehameha II of the European tradition,\\" in reference to the Polynesian allegory above. MacIntyre explains that, \\"Nietzschean man, the √úbermensch, [is] the man who transcends, finds his good nowhere in the social world to date, but only that in himself which dictates his own new law and his own new table of the virtues.\\" Although he disagreed with Nietzsche's inegalitarian and elitist view of humankind, he acknowledged the validity of Nietzsche's critique of Enlightenment morality as an explanation of the latter's degeneration into emotivism, and that, like Kamehameha II, Nietzsche had identified the moral imperatives of his time as arbitrary and incoherent in demanding their abolition. The nineteenth-century critic who has most lastingly and profoundly influenced MacIntyre is not Nietzsche but Marx‚Äîindeed, After Virtue originates in MacIntyre's plans to write a book repairing the moral weaknesses of Marxism. His critique of capitalism, and its associated liberal ideology and bureaucratic state (including what, in After Virtue, he condemned as the state capitalism of the USSR) is not expressed in traditional Marxist terms. Instead, it is written as a defence of ordinary social \\"practices\\", and of the \\"goods internal to practices\\". Pursuit of these helps to give narrative structure and intelligibility to our lives, but these goods must be defended against their corruption by \\"institutions\\", which pursue such \\"external goods\\" as money, power and status (chapters 14-15). MacIntyre seeks to find an alternative to Nietzsche's philosophy and eventually concludes that only classic Aristotelian thought can hope to save Western humanity. While Nietzsche seems to include the Aristotelian ethics and politics in his attack on the \\"degenerate disguises of the will to power,\\" MacIntyre claims that this cannot be done due to important differences between the structure and assumptions of Aristotelian and post-Enlightenment philosophy. These include: *Aristotle's assumption that man is as-he-happens- to-be and that this is distinct from man-as-he-should-be. The Enlightenment, on the other hand, offers no metaphysical framework whatsoever in place of teleology. *Aristotle's claim that rules are based on virtues, which are derived from an understanding of the telos. The Enlightenment reversed this and predicated virtues on an understanding of subjective (but purported to be universal) principles. *Aristotle's assertion that virtue and morality are integral parts of society, as an understanding of the telos must be social and not individual. In the Enlightenment, however, societies lost their moral authority and the individual became the fundamental interpreter of moral questions. MacIntyre opposes Nietzsche's return to the aristocratic ethics of Homeric Greece with the teleological approach to ethics pioneered by Aristotle. Nietzsche's critique of Enlightenment moral theory does not work against a teleological ethics. For MacIntyre, \\"Nietzsche replaces the fictions of the Enlightenment individualism, of which he is so contemptuous, with a set of individualist fictions of his own.\\" Nietzsche's √úbermensch , his solution to the lies of the Enlightenment, exposes the failure of the Enlightenment's epistemological project and of its search for a subjective yet universal morality. Nietzsche neglects the role of society in the formation and understanding of tradition and morality, and \\"Nietzsche's great man cannot enter into relationships mediated by appeal to shared standards or virtues or goods; he is his own only moral authority and his relationships to others have to be exercises of that authority... it will be to condemn oneself to that moral solipsism which constitutes Nietzschean greatness.\\" After Virtue ends by posing the question 'Nietzsche or Aristotle?', although MacIntyre acknowledges that the book does not give sufficient grounds for a definitive answer that it is Aristotle, not Nietzsche, who points to the best solution for the problems that the book has diagnosed. Those grounds are set out in MacIntyre's subsequent works, in which he elaborates a sophisticated revision of the philosophical tradition of Aristotelianism. In the end, however, MacIntyre tells us that we are waiting not for Godot but for Benedict of Nursia. MacIntyre criticizes individualist political philosophy, such as John Rawls' A Theory of Justice and Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia. To MacIntyre, morals and virtues can only be comprehended through their relation to the community in which they come from. Whereas Rawls tells us to conceive of justice through abstracting ourselves from who we are (through the veil of ignorance, for example) MacIntyre disagrees. Running throughout After Virtue is the belief that in order to comprehend who we are, we must understand where we come from. Reception The critic George Scialabba found After Virtue to be a strong critique of modernity, but claimed that MacIntyre \\"faltered\\" at the conclusion of the argument, when he sketched the features of what virtuous life should be like in the conditions of modernity. In particular, Scialabba objected to MacIntyre's claim that the good life for human beings consists in contemplating the good life for human beings; Scialabba found this insufficient and anticlimactic. Scialabba also argued that, although he appreciated MacIntyre's insistence on participation in community life as the best defense against the perils of modernity, this insistence was not justified with any discussion of how community life can be reconciled with the critical spirit that Scialabba finds to be one of the great achievements of modernity and of the philosophical enterprise.George Scialabba's review of After Virtue In a review for Political Theory, William E. Connolly argues that MacIntyre sees Nietzsche as \\"the adversary to be defeated, but Nietzsche's voice is not heard clearly\\". Connolly objects that MacIntyre's defense of virtue does not take into account Nietzsche's critique; MacIntyre also fails to build an account of telos that does not draw on biology in the way MacIntyre wanted to avoid‚Äîsuch a theory doesn't account for the fact that we are embodied. Anthony Ellis, in the journal Philosophy, argued that MacIntyre's positive philosophical project is not explained as well as it could have been: it is \\"of daunting opacity, though tantalizingly interesting\\" but not given enough space in the book. Ellis also states that the discussion of Rawls and Nozick in After Virtue \\"is slight and assertive\\". In the Review of Metaphysics, Christos Evangeliou said that if the reader \\"had expected to find in this book concretely how a revived Aristotelian tradition is supposed to work in order to shape ethically and rationally the irrational and disorderly modern world\\", they \\"may be a little disappointed in their expectations\\".

W. Bradford as his pen name, was an American writer chiefly known for editing, publishing, and writing for the libertarian magazine Liberty. Early life Bradford was born on September 20, 1947, in Detroit, Michigan. He was the son of Raymond Bradford and Eleanor Ritter Bradford. He edited his first periodical, a short-lived mimeographed zine called Eleutherian Forum, while a teenager. During the 1970s he developed a prosperous precious metals and numismatic business in Lansing, Michigan, Liberty Coin Service. He partially retired in 1980, moving to Port Townsend, Washington with his wife. Liberty magazine For Liberty, which he started in 1987, he wrote under his own name as well as several pseudonyms: as \\"Chester Alan Arthur\\" he engaged in political reportage and commentary, and as \\"Ethan O. Waters\\" he wrote deliberately provocative philosophical criticism and essays. (\\"Ethan O. Waters\\" was an anagram for \\"Owen Hatteras\\", a pseudonym used by H. L. Mencken, a writer and editor much admired by Bradford.) Liberty magazine has been one of the longest-running libertarian journals ever published, and along with Reason magazine can be considered a giant in libertarian media. Bradford was a consequentialist who favored a pragmatic approach to libertarian philosophy, grounding his limited government beliefs in a view of individual rights as social constructs, rather than a result of natural law. This approach differentiated Bradford from many other libertarian writers, as well as Ayn Rand. Bradford, however, was extremely tolerant of differences of opinion, and often published articles and essays by those with whom he disagreed; despite being against the war machine and opposed to the Iraq War, Bradford published articles written by proponents of the war. Many libertarian writers found a home at Liberty magazine, and the monthly continues to be edited and published by his good friend, Stephen Cox, and Bradford's widow, Kathy. In later years, Bradford became notable for his published criticisms of the Libertarian Party, whom he viewed as excessively didactic and electorally ineffective. He also reported upon what he viewed as financial mismanagement and cronyism by Libertarian Party officials. His criticism of the Libertarian Party's misuse of funds and ineffectual strategies often came into conflict with other libertarians, but his expose of financial mismanagement and cronyism is credited, along with the campaign of Michael Badnarik, with saving the Libertarian Party from disaster. Death He died of kidney cancer on December 8, 2005 in Port Townsend, Washington, aged 58.

The company's engineer, Benjamin Outram, was responsible for the design and Thomas Brown, the resident engineer, for its construction. The construction contract was placed with William Broadhead, Bethel Furness and William Anderson in 1795. Furness died later in 1795, so the aqueduct was completed by the remaining partners in 1799, but not brought into use until 1800. Seven men lost their lives during its construction. An aquatint of the aqueduct engraved by Francis Jukes from a drawing by Joseph Parry, 1803 It is the highest canal aqueduct in England and the highest masonry-arch aqueduct in Britain. The difference in water levels in the river and canal is some 90 feet (27.4m) (exceeded only by the Pontcysyllte aqueduct, an iron trough carried on stone columns, where the difference is 126 feet (38.4m)). It contains some 8,000 cubic yards (6,000 m¬≥) of masonry. The three semi-circular arches are about 78 feet (23.8m) above water level, with spans of approximately 60 feet (18.3m) at 72 feet (22m) centres. The lower parts are of red sandstone from the nearby Hyde Bank quarry. The upper parts are of white stone from a quarry at Chapel Milton. The abutments widen in well-proportioned curves and batter or diminish upwards in the same manner. The skilful use of architectural features, such as the circular piercing of the spandrels, string courses, arch rings and pilasters of ashlar stone, oval piers and stone of different type and colour have created a graceful structure, which is superlative in its class. In 1860, damage caused by repeated frost heave after water leaked through the puddling of the trough had to be urgently repaired by Charles Sacr√©, chief engineer of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, which then owned the canal. He tied together the two faces above the central arch by 2-inch bolts through the structure, secured by the plates that can still be seen. A hundred years later, a similar problem was ignored by British Waterways (BW) and on the night of 9 January 1962 the outer face of the north-east arch collapsed. BW, supported by the Ministry of Transport, thought that it would be \\"a complete waste of money\\" to do other than demolish the aqueduct and formally close the lower Peak Forest and Ashton Canals. However, it was saved by the intervention of Geoffrey Rippon, the Minister of Public Buildings and Works, who facilitated an agreement whereby a sympathetic Cheshire County Council funded the extra cost of full restoration, over and above what it would have cost BW to demolish it, under the terms of the Local Authorities (Historic Buildings) Act 1962, which Rippon himself had steered through Parliament. The main contractor for the restoration was Harry Fairclough Ltd of Warrington, with Rendel, Palmer & Tritton as the consulting engineers. The aqueduct was scheduled as an ancient monument soon afterwards and was Grade I listed in 1966. For many years, its picturesque setting in the Goyt valley was obscured by the uncontrolled growth of self-set trees. These have now been cut back to restore the view.

The museum building is also known as the Old Ashmolean Building to distinguish it from the newer Ashmolean Museum building completed in 1894. The museum was built in 1683, and it is the world's oldest surviving purpose-built museum. The museum is open to the general public every afternoon except Mondays, with free admission. History Built in 1683 to house Elias Ashmole's collection, it was the world's first purpose-built museum building and was also open to the public. The original concept of the museum was to institutionalize the new learning about nature that appeared in the 17th century and experiments concerning natural philosophy were undertaken in a chemical laboratory in the basement, while lectures and demonstration took place in the School of Natural History, on the middle floor. Ashmole's collection was expanded to include a broad range of activities associated with the history of natural knowledge and in 1924 the gift of Lewis Evans' collection allowed the museum further improvement, becoming the Museum of the History of Science and appointing Robert Gunther as its first curator. Collections and exhibitions Einstein's Blackboard, used by Albert Einstein in a 1931 lecture in Oxford. The collection and the building itself now occupies a special position in the study of the history of science and in the development of western culture and collecting. One of the most iconic objects in the collection is Einstein's Blackboard that Albert Einstein used on 16 May 1931 in his lectures while visiting the University of Oxford, rescued by dons including and E. J. Bowen and Gavin de Beer. The current collection contains around 18,000 objects from antiquity to the early 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science and is used for both academic study and enjoyment by the visiting public. The museum contains a wide range of scientific instruments, such as quadrants, astrolabes (the most complete collection in the world with c.170 instruments), sundials, early mathematical instruments (used for calculating, astronomy, navigation, surveying and drawing), optical instruments (microscopes, telescopes and cameras), equipment associated with chemistry, natural philosophy and medicine, and a reference library regarding the history of scientific instruments that includes manuscripts, incunabula, prints and printed ephemera, and early photographic items. The museum shows the development of mechanical clocks. Lantern clocks and longcase clocks are exhibited in the Beeson Room, named after the antiquarian horologist Cyril Beeson (1889‚Äì1975) who gave his collection to the museum. Early turret clocks are exhibited above the stairs from the basement to the raised ground floor. From October 2009 until February 2010, the Museum hosted the first major exhibition of Steampunk art objects, curated by Art Donovan and presented by Dr Jim Bennett, then the museum director. The museum is also home to the Rochester Avionic Archive, which includes a collection of avionics that originated with the Elliot Brothers, but also includes pieces from Marconi and BAE Systems.

The band was formed in 1994 in Bangkok, Thailand. Its name is derived from a play on hi-so, Thai slang for socialites and the upper class (from English 'high society'), and is meant to reflect the group's humble origins. It is one of the first Thai bands to achieve success on the international music scene, having played festivals, including South By Southwest and Glastonbury, and to be produced by a Western record producer. The group completed and released their first demo in late 1995. Loso disbanded in 2003, and afterwards, Seksan continued as Sek Loso. History =First album= Within a year of its formation, Sek had written 10 songs. With drummer Kittisak \\"Yai\\" Khotkam (b. January 22, 1973) and bassist Apirath \\"Rath\\" Sukkhajitr (b. September 20, 1967), Sek recorded the tracks in a night in late 1995 and sent the demo tape to Asanee Chotikul of the popular Thai rock duo Asanee-Wasan. Called Lo Society, the band's demo tape was released as an album in 1996 on Asanee's indie record label and distributed by GMM Grammy, Thailand's biggest record company. It sold 1.5 million copies. =Celebrity status= Loso released eight more albums, each selling at least 1 million copies (\\"platinum\\" status on the RIAA certification scale), and some selling 3 million copies. Among the band's most popular songs is \\"Som Sarn\\" (Thai: \\"‡∏ã‡∏°‡∏ã‡∏≤‡∏ô\\" or \\"Hesitant\\"), which features an acoustic guitar intro that is widely recognized in Thailand. Another hit was Pantip, with its hook chorus, \\"ja mai pai Pantip\\" (\\"will not go Pantip\\" or \\"I won't go to Pantip\\"). The song is about a man dating a woman and taking her shopping at World Trade Center, MBK Center and Siam Square, but he refuses to take her to Pantip Plaza because his ex-girlfriend has a shop there. The band's line up remained stable except for a period where Apirath was replaced by Nattaphon \\"Klang\\" Suntharaanu. Klang Loso played bass on the Rock & Roll and Losoland albums and toured with the band. Apirath Loso then returned to bass duties with the band until its demise. Just about all the band's albums are accompanied by the release of a karaoke VCD, featuring music videos of the songs. Through the music videos and his appearance as pitchman for the M-150 brand energy drink, Sek Loso, usually wearing sunglasses, has achieved cultural icon status in Thailand. He even spoofed his celebrity image with a Sek lookalike making a cameo appearance in the 2005 Thai action film, Tom-Yum-Goong. The song that accompanies the M-150 commercials, the ballad \\"Teh Yang Thai\\" (\\"‡πÄ‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢\\"), is another hit. =Going solo= After the release of the 2002 live album Loso Concert, Loso broke up, with Sek Loso becoming a solo act. Kittisak and Apirath formed a new band, Fahrenheit. Sek released his debut solo album, 7 August, in 2003 and duetted with veteran string and luk thung star Bird McIntyre, for the 2004 hit album, Bird Sek. The pair played sold-out concerts at Bangkok's Impact Arena.Weekend staff (June 4, 2004). Creating a flap , The Nation (retrieved July 24, 2006). Sek, meanwhile, had aspirations beyond the Thai music scene: In Thai music terminology, he wanted to \\"go inter\\". He had been reading biographies of his rock idol, Jimi Hendrix, and decided that to achieve international stardom he needed to go to England as Hendrix had. In 2004, he moved to London and enrolled in an ESOL school, and after six months of intensive learning, he could speak English with an upper-class British accent. He began writing songs in English and placed advertisements in NME for a bass player and drummer to form a new Loso, auditioning prospects by having them perform the entire Hendrix album, Are You Experienced. =Brief Reunion= Loso classic lineup had been reunited to celebrate Seksan's wedding in 2020.

She is the former managing director of Birmingham City F.C. and current vice-chairman of West Ham United F.C.. She is featured in the BBC One series The Apprentice as an aide to Alan Sugar. She was the Small Business Ambassador to the UK Government under Prime Minister David Cameron. Her appointment with Birmingham City began in March 1993, when she was 23. In 2002 she became the first woman to hold such a post in the top flight of English football when the team was promoted. She oversaw the company's flotation in 1997, thus becoming the youngest managing director of a UK plc. She left in 2009. In January 2010 she was appointed vice-chairman of West Ham United following Sullivan and Gold's purchasing of the club. Brady is a regular writer for the Woman & Home magazine and The Sun. She has also published four books including two novels, and her latest title, Strong Woman, published in March 2012 and aimed at inspiring women in business, is a Sunday Times Bestseller. On 22 September 2014, Brady was elevated to the House of Lords as a Conservative life peer, taking the title Baroness Brady. On 17 July 2017, she was appointed by Sir Philip Green to chairman of Taveta, owners of the Arcadia Group. Early life Brady was brought up in Edmonton, London, and the family house was near the Tottenham Hotspur football ground. Her Irish father, Terry Brady, had made his fortune in printing and property development. Her mother, Rita, is Italian, and she has an older brother, Darren. She attended Salcombe Preparatory School in Southgate until she was 11, followed by Poles Convent, a boarding school in Ware, Hertfordshire, and Aldenham School, Elstree, a boys' school which accepted girls in the sixth form, where she gained four A-levels. Career = Early career and Birmingham City = Brady's career began as a trainee at the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi having been rejected for a place on a journalism course at Harlow College. Despite the course rejection, Brady said in a 2018 interview that she made a conscious decision not to go to university, as she was keen to get out in the world and make her mark. A year later, on joining the London Broadcasting Company (LBC) as an advertising account executive, she targeted the advertising business of one of her father's largest clients, publisher David Sullivan, owner of the Daily Sport and the Sunday Sport. Sullivan spent more than ¬£2,000,000 on advertising in six months and was so impressed with Brady that he gave her a job. Sullivan offered her a job with Sport Newspapers, and she became one of his directors at the age of 20. While in Sullivan's employ, Brady spotted an advert in the Financial Times for the sale of Birmingham City F.C. when the club was in receivership and persuaded Sullivan to buy it and let her run it. When Sullivan commented that she would have to be twice as good as a man to do that, Brady replied quickly: ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs not difficult.‚ÄùKarren Brady scores with a peerage. The room was packed, the speaker was brilliant and the next day‚Äôs news (albeit leaked) deserved a soccer-size round of applause. Shropshire Star, Saturday, 28 February 2015. Sullivan later commented that he agreed to the deal because such a young, female director would attract publicity to the club, and also because Brady was a ‚Äúsacker‚Äù. Brady was 23 when she started work as managing director of Birmingham City F.C. in March 1993. She encountered sexism in the role. The first time she got on the team bus, a player said \\"I can see your tits from here\\". Brady replied ‚ÄúWhen I sell you to Crewe, you won't be able to see them from there will you?\\" She sold the player shortly afterwards. In 2008, Sullivan and Brady were arrested by City of London Police, interviewed and released on bail as part of the investigation into the 2006 allegations of corruption in English football, which also involved similar actions against players and officials from other clubs; club chairman David Gold was interviewed as a witness. The club stated that no charges had been brought and that Brady denied any wrongdoing. The investigation involved tax and national insurance offences relating to two players. Gold said that it was \\"utterly wrong that this highly professional businesswoman has been made a victim in a witch-hunt against football\\". In August 2009 it was confirmed that no further action would be taken. She left Birmingham City two months later after Sullivan and Gold sold the club to Carson Yeung for ¬£81.5 million. The same month she was appointed as a non-executive director to the England 2018 World Cup bid advisory board. =West Ham United = In January 2010, she was appointed Vice-Chairman of West Ham United by new Joint-Chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold. Writing in her newspaper column Brady said \\"To West Ham fans I'll make a single pledge ‚Äì while we are on the board, we will hang in the Tower of London before your club again goes through the financial turmoil which so nearly brought it down\\". Brady said she liked the idea of changing the club's name to West Ham Olympic. David Gold subsequently said that the club would always be West Ham United under his chairmanship but \\"What you might do is call the stadium West Ham Olympic stadium. I can make a case for that.\\" Brady was responsible for negotiating a move on behalf of West Ham United from their Boleyn Ground to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London. Initially the intention was for West Ham to take ownership of the stadium, this bid collapsing in October 2011 following a legal delay caused by a rival bid by Tottenham Hotspur. Investigators working on behalf of Tottenham were subsequently charged with fraud for obtaining illegally the private telephone records of Brady. In December 2012, West Ham were announced as the highest ranked bidder to become the anchor concessionaire and tenant of the Olympic Stadium. Of the move Brady said \\"We are ambitious for our great club and aim to set the benchmark for visiting away and neutral supporters from across the globe to come and enjoy the iconic Stadium and be part of our Premier League club experience\\". West Ham United were named as anchor concessionaires for the Olympic Stadium on 23 March 2013. In July 2013, Brady gave evidence before a House of Lords committee, where she said the club has debts of ¬£70m that would need to be paid before the proposed move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016. Brady oversaw the club's move from the Boleyn Ground to the Olympic Stadium in the summer of 2016. Subsequently renamed as London Stadium, the move saw West Ham United increase their capacity from 35,000 to 57,000 seats ‚Äì which were completely sold out before the start of the 2016‚Äì17 campaign, giving the Club the third biggest home attendance in the Premier League. Following the move to the Olympic Stadium, some supporters who wanted to stay at Upton Park targeted verbal abuse towards Brady and other board members during crowd disturbances during West Ham's home 2‚Äì4 defeat to Watford on 10 September 2016. In October 2016, Brady received further criticism after describing West Ham's move to the London Stadium as \\"a chance to rebrand the club\\". Brady later clarified her comments, made at the Leaders Sport Business Summit, and went on to describe West Ham's move to the new stadium as \\"part of our ambitious strategy to take our Club to the very top of the world‚Äôs most- popular sport.\\" =Other business involvement= Brady has also been the chairman of Bauer's Kerrang!, and had a seat on the board of Sport England. She was a non-executive director of Channel 4 television but resigned to take a position at Syco, the company jointly owned by Simon Cowell and Sony. In September 2010 she joined the board of Taveta Investments Ltd. with Sir Philip Green, resigning from a non-executive position with Mothercare where she had been for seven years. She is an Ambassador for Barclays Life skills, which aims to offer young people workplace experience. She is also the Patron of the Life After Stroke Awards and an Ambassador for Well Being for Women. =Championing women in business= Brady has long been renowned for championing the cause of women in business. She has repeatedly called upon her fellow female professionals to help those trying to make their way in the business world. She explained in this Guardian column: ‚ÄúAny board executive can forget just how many people helped them get where they are. Those women who have got to the top need actively to ensure there is a pipeline of younger women, whether by networking or mentoring, who in turn is encouraging those below them. Women in the boardroom must not forget how many challenges and difficulties we have overcome, and we should share our coping strategies. ‚ÄúIt is critical to create opportunities to identify talented women in business, then support them to develop their confidence to aim for the boardroom. We need to look outside the corporate mainstream, at female entrepreneurs and self-employed businesswomen, who can inject different insights and diversity to any board.‚Äù Similarly, Brady famously told the Independent: \\"If you don't have a woman on your board you should write to your shareholders and explain why. Tell us how many women you've interviewed and what skills they've been lacking, because that will give us some basis to teach the new generation of women in business.\\" Brady was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to entrepreneurship and women in business. =The Apprentice= In March 2007, Brady appeared as a celebrity contestant on Comic Relief Does The Apprentice and was team leader for the girls' team, raising more than ¬£750,000 for Comic Relief. In June 2008, Brady was a guest interviewer in series four of The Apprentice ‚Äì interviewing the final five. After the show, it was revealed that Brady had fulfilled a promise she made to Lord Alan Sugar on screen, and offered a job to Claire Young, who finished as runner-up in the series, after being impressed by her interview. In 2009 she interviewed candidates again in The Apprentice Season 5, as seen on BBC 1. On 30 August 2009, she was revealed as Sugar's new assistant in the sixth series of The Apprentice, replacing Margaret Mountford, who had left the series (and who returned in series 6, 7, 8 and 9 as a guest interviewer, the same role that Brady had fulfilled in her first appearance in the main UK apprentice series). Political career Brady hinted that she would be interested in a career in politics in the future during an interview with The Daily Telegraph in March 2013. In September that year it was reported that she would be giving an introductory speech for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, at the Conservative Party Conference. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Margot James, MP, said: \\"I think she'd be a great asset. I have a great respect for her success in business.\\". The feature also suggested that Brady should be made a peer to bring more women into politics and to resolve the UK's financial problems. ‚ÄòBut Baroness Brady would be able to make an invaluable contribution to both business and politics. David Cameron should give her a peerage without delay ‚Äì and she should accept it.‚Äô On 30 September 2013, Brady addressed the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on the subjects of small businesses and supporting Osborne's policies as Chancellor, and she was also appointed the government's Small Business Ambassador. On 8 August 2014, it was reported that Brady would become a Conservative life peer in the House of Lords. On 22 September 2014 she was created Baroness Brady, of Knightsbridge in the City of Westminster. On 26 October 2015, Brady was involved in a controversial House of Lords vote over proposed cuts to tax credits, voting with the Government in favour of the plan. In February 2019, the Daily Telegraph reported that she was facing questioning about her role in non- disclosure agreements (NDAs) relating to allegations of misbehaviour on the part of the businessman Philip Green. Personal life In 1995, Brady married Canadian footballer Paul Peschisolido, who played for Birmingham City for two seasons, 1992‚Äì93 and 1993‚Äì94. In 1996, she had her first child, a girl named Sophia. She had around six weeks off work after the birth of her second child, a boy named Paolo. Brady lives in the Knightsbridge area of London with her husband. They also had a property in the village of Knowle in the West Midlands and her husband owned a house in Canada. In 2006, Brady underwent a full-body MRI scan as part of a medical screen, which unexpectedly discovered a potentially fatal cerebral aneurysm. Doctors told Brady at the time that she had a 30 per cent chance of dying from the condition, and that it was a miracle that she had survived the births of her two children.

He was the subject of the Oscar-winning film Ryan. Early life Larkin had idolized his older brother, Ronald, whom he described as \\"the epitome of cool\\". In 1958, at the age of fifteen, Larkin witnessed his brother die in a boating accident and, because he had never learned to swim, was unable to save him. Larkin stated that his brother's death deeply scarred him. Larkin attended the Art School of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts where he studied under Arthur Lismer (a member of the Group of Seven) before starting to work at the National Film Board of Canada in 1962. Larkin was bisexual, having had sexual and romantic relationships with both women and men during his lifetime.\\"Ryan Larkin, the Self-Destructive Genius\\". WFMU-FM, July 30, 2011. NFB years At the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), Larkin learned animation techniques from the ground-breaking and award-winning animator Norman McLaren. He made two acclaimed short animated films, Syrinx (1965) and Cityscape (1966), before going on to create Walking (1969). Walking was nominated for an Academy Award in 1970 in the category Best Short Subject, Cartoon, but lost to It's Tough to Be a Bird by director Ward Kimball. Syrinx won many international awards. He went on to direct the award-winning short Street Musique, which premiered in 1972 and would be the last of his works, finished during his lifetime. He also contributed art work and animation effects to NFB films including the 1974 feature Running Time, directed by Mort Ransen, in which Larkin also played three bit parts. In 1975, the NFB commissioned Larkin to create a mural for the entrance foyer at its Montreal headquarters. He delivered a piece featuring an adolescent boy with an erection, which the NFB removed from viewing. Larkin left the NFB in 1978. Ryan, the film In later years Larkin was plagued by a downward spiral of drug abuse, alcoholism and homelessness. By this time estranged from his parents, he had developed a routine of spending his nights at the Old Brewery Mission, and his days panhandling at Schwartz's, eating at Mondo Frites, drinking beer at the Copacabana bar, or reading a book in the lounge at Welch's used book store. Towards the end of his life, he found himself back in the limelight when a 14-minute computer- animated documentary on his life, Ryan, by Canadian animator Chris Landreth, won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film and screened to acclaim at film festivals throughout the world. Alter Egos (2004), directed by Laurence Green, is a documentary about the making of Ryan that includes interviews with both Larkin and Chris Landreth as well as with various people who knew Larkin at the peak of his own success. Later work As of 2002, Larkin had been working with composer Laurie Gordon of the band Chiwawa on a new animated film entitled Spare Change, his first auteur film since working at the NFB. Together they founded Spare Change Productions and sought funding for the film through Gordon's production company MusiVision. They received grants from Bravo!FACT, the Canada Council for the Arts and the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Qu√©bec and SODEC but were still short of financing. MusiVision and the National Film Board of Canada went into co-production only after Larkin's death. Spare Change premiered at the Festival du Nouveau Cinema on October 9, 2008. Spare Change features three CHIWAWA tunes for which Larkin created storyboards and animation, including Do It For Me from the 2005 release Bright. A new CHIWAWA album Bus Stop Chinese Buffet will include tracks from Spare Change including Overcast Skies whose lyrics were penned by Larkin, and part of a group of Larkin poems - Beat Poems For Grandkids. MusiVision also produced the documentary film Ryan's Renaissance for CTV Television about Ryan's final years, his return to creating art, and Spare Change. It was produced by Gordon and Nicola Zavaglia. Larkin, who had panhandled outside Montreal Schwartz's deli, appeared briefly in a documentary on the famous restaurant, Chez Schwartz, directed by Garry Beitel In December 2006, Larkin created three five-second bumpers for MTV in Canada, a preview to Spare Change. Each frame was hand-drawn. It was the first professional work he had executed in over 20 years. Larkin said that he had given up some bad habits, including drinking, in order to better focus on his animating career. Death Larkin died in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec on February 14, 2007 from lung cancer which had spread to his brain.

Some leagues maintain official lists of dynasties, often as part of a hall of fame, but in many cases, whether a team or individual has achieved a dynasty is subjective. This can result in frequent topic of debate among sports fans due to lack of consensus and agreement in the many different variables and criteria that fans may use to define a sports dynasty. Merriam-Webster describes a dynasty as a \\"sports franchise which has a prolonged run of successful seasons\\".

NCAA Football =Division I= Football Bowl Subdivision (Formerly I-A) The problems inherent in identifying sports dynasties are exacerbated in NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision, where the national champion is determined, at least in part, by poll rather than through a tournament. These polls, however, are largely based on win-loss records, thereby relying on minimal subjectivity. When fans of a sport cannot agree on which team within a league or other organization should be considered as holding that organization's championship, discussing whether a team has become a dynasty is more difficult. Because of these problems, teams that consistently win their conference championship and are frequently in contention for national championships are termed dynasties more often than a similarly performing team in another sport or division might. * Yale ‚Äì nineteen championships between 1874 and 1909 * Michigan ‚Äì four championships in four years, 5 straight undefeated seasons between 1901 and 1905. * Pittsburgh, 1910‚Äì1918 ‚Äì five championships in nine seasons (1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918) * Notre Dame, 1919‚Äì1930.

Track and Cross Country * United States Men's Olympic 4 √ó 100 meter team, 1916‚Äì1992 * Kenyan runners, 1968‚Äì1999 * University High School Normal Illinois 2010‚Äì2015 Men's and Women's Intercity Cross Country Championships Collegiate Volleyball * The NCAA Division I Penn State Nittany Lions women's volleyball team won four consecutive National Championships from 2007 to 2010, including two perfect seasons in 2008 and 2009, and then the Nittany Lions repeated in 2013 & 2014, to make it six Championships in eight years and seven overall titles with the first title coming in 1999; and Big Ten Conference Championships from 2003 to 2010, 2013 and 2014. * The Concordia University (Saint Paul) women's volleyball team have captured NCAA Division II Championships in seven consecutive seasons ‚Äì the only NCAA volleyball program to accomplish the feat at the Division I or II levels. Their seven total volleyball titles is more than any program as well, with the sport dating back to 1980, at the women's Division II level. Their head coach, Brady Starkey, boasts a 306‚Äì26 overall record (.926) making him the winningest active NCAA volleyball coach in any division by overall percentage. They have also mounted 9 consecutive conference Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference championships (from 2003 to 2011) including 6-undefeated conference campaigns. * The NCAA Division III Washington University in St. Louis women's volleyball team were the first volleyball team to win six consecutive national championships, from 1991 to 1996. They have won a total of 10 NCAA championships, including 26 consecutive appearances in the championship tournament dating back to 1987, the most of any program at any level.  Dynasties in question  Most disputes about dynasties relate to teams that dominated within a conference or division, but either failed to win championships or infrequently won championships. This is exacerbated in NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A), where the national champion is determined, at least in part, by poll rather than through a tournament. * Atlanta Braves Won 14 straight division titles from 1991 to 2005, and won 5 NL pennants during the 1990s, but could only win one World Series in 1995. *Buffalo Bills won 4 AFC Championships in a row from 1990 to 1993, the only team ever to do so, and for this they are sometimes considered a dynasty. However, they went on to lose the Super Bowl all four times; the Bills' AFC dominance partially overlapped with the Dallas Cowboys dynasty. * Boise State Broncos football from 1998 to 2008. At 113‚Äì26, their 81.29% win rate was the highest in the nation. Won ten of twelve conference championships from 1999 to 2009, undefeated in conference play in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2009, perfect seasons in 2006 and 2009, but has never been selected to play in the Division I-A national championship. * Detroit Red Wings of the mid-1990s through the late 2000s. Although not officially listed by the NHL as a dynasty, the Red Wings won 4 Stanley Cups in 11 seasons (1997, 1998, 2002, 2008) and went to the Stanley Cup Finals six times in fourteen seasons (1995, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2008, and 2009). The Red Wings had the best team record during both the 1990s and 2000s, accumulating the most points of any franchise during each decade. Detroit won the Presidents' Trophy for the best regular season record in the NHL in 1995, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008, in all winning their division thirteen times during this span. The Red Wings qualified for the playoffs in 25 consecutive seasons from 1991 through 2016 (excluding the 2005 season which was cancelled due to a lockout). *San Antonio Spurs of 1999 to 2014 led by Tim Duncan. (five NBA championships (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014) in sixteen seasons, six Western Conference titles, eleven division championships, and seventeen consecutive playoff appearances from 1998 to 2014, with a .705 win percentage during that span, the highest in any of the four major American sports) are considered a dynasty by some,ABC News: Fantastic Four! Spurs Sweep NBA Title but not by others because they did not win consecutive titles. *San Francisco Giants: From 2010 to 2014. Led by manager Bruce Bochy, Buster Posey, Madison Bumgarner, Pablo Sandoval and Hunter Pence. The Giants won three World Series Championships in a 5-year span (2010, 2012, and 2014). They are only the second NL team ever, since the 1940s St. Louis Cardinals, to do so. However, despite winning three championships, many do not consider the Giants a dynasty because they did not win consecutive titles nor did they win their division or make the playoffs in the years between (2011 and 2013). In 2013, they were below 500. *University of Southern California football, 2002‚Äì2005 ‚Äì two consecutive AP national championships (2003 and 2004), appearance in the 2005 National Championship Game, seven straight Pac-10 titles, six major bowl wins in seven years (Rose: 2003 and 2007‚Äì2009, Orange: 2004 and 2005), and maintained a 34-game winning streak from 2003 to 2005. However, USC was forced to vacate two wins from the 2004 season including the Orange Bowl win and BCS national Championship, all wins from the 2005 season, and the Pac-10 titles from both of those seasons as the result of rules violations involving star running back Reggie Bush. Notes The 1916 and 1917 VFA seasons were cancelled due to World War I The Football League suspended operations between 1939‚Äì40 and 1945‚Äì46 inclusive due to World War II and planning difficulties in its aftermath. The Allied conquest of Italy caused normal Serie A football to be suspended between 1943 and 1944 and 1945‚Äì46, though the 1946 scudetto is considered official.

Opened for trade on 31 August 1796, it remained in operation until the 1920s. Much of the route and the structures associated with the line remain. The western section of the line is now the route of the Peak Forest Tramway Trail. The tramway was originally planned to be about long from Chapel Milton to Dove Holes. However, it was decided to start the tramway at Bugsworth (now called Buxworth) and, as built, it was about long. Its purpose was to carry limestone from the vast quarries around Dove Holes down to Bugsworth Basin via Chapel- en-le-Frith and Chinley, where much of it was taken by boat along the Peak Forest Canal and the Ashton Canal to Manchester and beyond. The remaining limestone was put into lime kilns at Bugsworth where it was converted into quick lime (or burnt lime). Construction Built by Benjamin Outram, the tramway was initially single-track, on a gauge, constructed of stone sleeper blocks and L-section cast-iron rails that were fastened directly onto the blocks, in the same manner as his Little Eaton Gangway built for the Derby Canal. The rails, known as gang rails or plates, were provided by Benjamin Outram and Company who also supplied the mineral waggons. From Bugsworth it rose to Whitehough, then proceeded to Chapel Milton on the level. It then climbed 56¬Ω to the base of the inclined plane, which took the line upwards over a distance of . After a more gentle slope to Barmoor Clough the line proceeded to the Dove Holes quarries. To aid acceleration from the top, and braking at the foot, the inclined plane varied from 1 in 6 at the top to 1 in 12 at the base. It was intended to be, at least partly, self-acting with descending wagons counterbalanced to some extent by partly loaded wagons being drawn up. Initially rope was tried, followed by a patent twisted chain, passing round a wheel, with a brake to control it, in a pit at the top. Eventually a chain with links was purchased from Birmingham, which proved more equal to the work. By the beginning of the 20th century this had been replaced by a steel rope. There was another small incline of within the quarry complex worked by a horse-gin at the top and a continuous rope. The mineral waggons were originally similar to those used for the earlier Little Eaton Gangway, with a substantial wooden chassis with a wrought-iron body held in place by two wooden wedges. The axles were bolted onto axle trees and the cast-iron wheels (about 20 inches in diameter) were held on the axles by a linchpin (known as a \\"lily-pin\\"). Later the bodies were fixed with a door at the back, unloading by means of a tippler mechanism mounted on a turntable. Each waggon carried between of limestone. From the bottom of the plane to Bugsworth Basin, a team of four horses could draw up to twenty wagons. The ganger and nipper (apprentice), controlling a gang of waggons, rode on the axles and kept the speed at by spragging the wheels to make them skid. History Chapel Milton viaduct, c. 1900, with Peak Forest Tramway in left foreground In 1803 the tramway was made double-track, with the exception of Stodhart Tunnel and below Buxton Road Bridge, using the same method of fixing the rails. Problems were experienced because the rails became loose, and to overcome these the main line was relaid between 1832 and 1837 using pedestals or saddles placed between the rails and the stone sleeper blocks. Over the years the design of the rails and saddles underwent many modifications and in circa 1865 much of the main line was replaced by L-section steel rails 9 and long rolled at the Gorton Works (Gorton Tank) of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company. In 1846 the MSLR's predecessor, the Sheffield, Ashton-under- Lyne and Manchester Railway, took on a ¬£9,325 a year () perpetual lease of the Peak Forest Canal, including the tramway. The railway became owner of the canal in 1883. The tramway closed in 1920 and its rails and waggons were sold by the LNER.Railway Magazine September 1963 pp. 611-617 Peter Clowes: The Peak Forest Limestone Tramway The most important surviving features of the tramway are the elevated tramway branch at Bugsworth Basin, Stodhart Tunnel and the self-acting inclined plane at Chapel-en-le-Frith, known as the Chapel inclined plane. The elevated tramway branch forms part of the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Bugsworth Basin. It was believed that the Grade II* listed Stodhart Tunnel was the oldest railway tunnel in the world until archaeological work on the Butterley Gangroad (also in Derbyshire) in May 2013 suggested that Fritchley Tunnel on that line was older than Stodhart Tunnel. A wagon is on display in the York Railway Museum and a wheel and track items at the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.

The extreme lightness of its spores has led to its global distribution. Etymology Common bracken was first described as Pteris aquilina by Carl Linnaeus, in Volume 2 of his Species Plantarum in 1753. The origin of the specific epithet derived from the Latin aquila \\"eagle\\". In the reprint of the Flora Suecica in 1755, Linnaeus explains that the name refers to the image of an eagle seen in the transverse section of the root.radix oblique dissecta refert aliquatenus aquilam imperialem In spite of this, the opinion has been forwarded that the name pertains to the shape of the mature fronds appearing akin to an eagle's wing. However, medieval scholars, including Erasmus, thought the pattern of the fibres seen in a transverse section of the stipe resembled a double-headed eagle or oak tree. Taxonomy It was traditionally treated as the sole species in the genus Pteridium (brackens); authorities have split and recognised up to 11 species in the genus, however. It was placed in the genus Pteridium by Friedrich Adalbert Maximilian Kuhn in 1879. Description Common bracken is a herbaceous perennial plant, deciduous in winter. The large, roughly triangular fronds are produced singly, arising upwards from an underground rhizome, and grow to 0.3‚Äì1 m (1‚Äì3ft) tall; the main stem, or stipe, is up to 1 cm (0.4 in) diameter at the base. It dies back to ground level in autumn.Clapham, A.R., Tutin, T.G. and Warburg, E.F. 1968 Excursion Flora of the British Isles. Cambridge University Press. .

Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. . They are arranged in narrow brown bands, and form spores over July, August and September. Habitat Bracken grows in pastures, deciduous and coniferous woodlands, and hillsides. It prefers acidic soils. An adaptable plant, bracken readily colonises disturbed areas. It can even be aggressive in countries where it is native, such as England, where it has invaded heather (Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull) stands on the North Yorkshire moors. In Ireland, bracken is found in open woodland and sandy pastures. Distribution Bracken is native to Europe, Eastern Asia and North America. In America, it is found throughout the continental United States and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and Newfoundland. Its range's northern border extends to southern Alaska, while its southern reaches the northern portions of Mexico.  Uses  = Food = Bracken is a widely eaten vegetable in Korea, Japan and parts of China. In Korea, bracken is known as gosari. It is soaked, parboiled, and stir-fried, and often eaten as a side dish (namul). It is also a classic ingredient of bibimbap. In Japan, young bracken shoots are steamed, boiled, or cooked in soups. The shoots are also preserved in salt, sake, or miso. Bracken shoots have been used to produce beer in Siberia, and among indigenous peoples of North America. The rhizome can be ground into flour to make bread. In the Canary Islands, the rhizome was historically used to make a porridge called gofio. Bracken leaves are used in the Mediterranean region to filter sheep's milk, and to store freshly made ricotta cheese. File:Dried Eastern brakenfern.jpgDried bracken (gosari) from Korea File:Gosari.jpgSeasoned stir-fried braken (gosari namul) from Korea = Pharmacology = P. aquilinum has been investigated for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties.  Toxicity  The plant contains the carcinogenic compound ptaquiloside. High stomach cancer rates are found in Japan and North Wales, where the young stems are used as a vegetable, but it is unknown whether bracken plays any part at all. Consumption of ptaquiloside- contaminated milk is thought to contribute to human gastric cancer in the Andean states of Venezuela. The spores have also been implicated as carcinogens. However, ptaquiloside is water soluble, and is reduced by soaking bracken in cool water. Korean and Japanese cooks have traditionally soaked the shoots in water and ash to detoxify the plant before eating. Ptaquiloside also degenerates at room temperature, which explains why the rat studies were done with the toxin stored at . At boiling temperature, the carcinogen denatures almost completely. Salt and baking soda also help with volatilizing the chemical. It has been suggested that selenium supplementation can prevent as well as reverse the immunotoxic effects induced by ptaquiloside from Pteridium aquilinum.

He owned land at Disley, Manchester and Heaton Norris and he lived at Ardwick Green, Manchester. He is best known as the resident engineer for the construction of the Peak Forest Canal and the Peak Forest Tramway and in 1793 he made the initial survey of their routes. Following the resignation of Benjamin Outram in 1801 he was appointed as consulting engineer for the completion of the Marple canal locks. He was also the surveyor for the Ashton Canal and the resident engineer for the construction of the Macclesfield Canal. By 1841 he was living in Allerton Place at 16 Ardwick Green.

The film is written by David Loughery and directed by Franco Amurri. Plot Huey Walker (Dennis Hopper), a hippie and a former New Left radical (in the vein of Abbie HoffmanSenses of Cinema) who has been on the run from the law for 20 years for something he did not do, disconnecting Spiro Agnew's train car in Spokane, Washington. John Buckner (Kiefer Sutherland) is an FBI agent who is set to transport Walker back to Spokane for trial. Their journey forces them to cross paths with a corrupt Sheriff Hightower and the two end up fleeing for their lives. As the story progresses, it is revealed that Buckner was raised on a communal farm and that his given name is Free. As Buckner learns to reconcile his past with his present, Walker does as well. Cast * Dennis Hopper as Huey Walker * Kiefer Sutherland as Free 'John' Buckner * Carol Kane as Maggie * Paul Dooley as Stark * Cliff De Young as Sheriff Hightower * Richard Masur as Barry * Michael McKean as Hal Reception The film received mixed reviews. Vincent Canby in The New York Times stated, > About 30 minutes before it's over, Flashback begins to go to pieces, like > someone who has overdosed on carrot juice and organic marzipan. The movie > becomes woozy and sort of distraught. Until then, it's an engaging comedy > about the confrontation of a superannuated flower child of the 1960s and a > 26-year-old representative of the clean-shaven, cholesterol-conscious, > fiercely conservative 1980s. The Los Angeles Times critic Peter Rainer stated: > In \\"Flashback\\" (citywide), the casting of Dennis Hopper as an Abbie Hoffman- > like radical prankster is weirdly dislocating. Still primarily identified > with \\"Easy Rider,\\" Hopper is the shaggy archetype of '60s hippie anomie. > [...] Despite his scraggly derelict's appearance and screw-loose antics, he > is wised-up and politically right on. He is, God help us, the conscience of > the '60s. And that's where the dislocation comes in. Hopper represents the > fringes of hippiedom for us, yet his character here is also being promoted > as a robust politico‚Äîan Abbie Hoffman in Rip Van Winkle drag. Remarked Roger Ebert, > I've heard people complaining recently that once you've seen the coming > attractions trailer for a movie, you've seen the movie. That's the way I > felt after seeing the trailer for Franco Amurri's Flashback, but the film > itself is a pleasant surprise - deeper and more original than the formula > that the trailer seems to promise. The then-new Entertainment Weekly magazine gave the film a B+, stating: > Ever since the mythic ‚Äô60s ended, countercultural idealists have been > grappling with the loss of what they believed would be their eternal youth. > Considering how many serious books and movies have addressed the aging of > the Woodstock generation, it‚Äôs surprising to find Flashback, a seemingly > insubstantial film that has something important to say on the subject. [...] > Screenwriter David Loughery cleverly builds this simple role reversal into > an affecting vehicle for exploring identity and growth. Against all odds, > the movie manages to avoid easy caricatures. [...] Unlike many such voyages > through the past, this is one ‚Äô60s trip that‚Äôs worth repeating. Based on fourteen reviews, the film has a score of 40% on Rotten Tomatoes. =Box office= The film debuted at number 5. Soundtrack The film produced a fairly popular soundtrack made up of a mix of 1960s and 1980s alternative music. The highlight is the theme song \\"Free\\" by the band Big Audio Dynamite, which is only available on this soundtrack; it was never included in any Big Audio Dynamite album, although the single edit appears on their compilation Planet B.A.D. . A remake of the song, titled \\"Kickin' In\\", was later recorded by Big Audio Dynamite II and included on the Kool-Aid album. Bob Dylan's version of Curtis Mayfield's \\"People Get Ready\\" is also only available on this soundtrack, as it hasn't yet been released on any Dylan album or any of his many box sets or Bootleg Series releases, although a different version that Dylan recorded in 1975 is available on iTunes as a bonus track on Bob Dylan: The Collection.

It was formed in 1939 as the second armoured division in the Italian Army after the 131 Armoured Division Centauro. The division fought in the North African Campaign until being destroyed during the Second Battle of El Alamein. After World War II the division was reformed as part of the Italian Army.  World War II  = France = The 132nd Armoured Division Ariete was formed in Milan in February 1939, it was initially made up of the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, equipped with L3/35 tankettes, the 132nd Armored Artillery Regiment, and additional divisional support units. The division was moved to the French border at the outbreak of World War II, but was kept in reserve during the short campaign on that front. It was part of the Army of the Po, the strategic reserve. By that time the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment had grown to eight battalions: three light ones with L3/35 tankettes, two medium ones with M11/39 tanks, and three medium ones with M13/40 tanks. = Libya = In 1940 the I, II, III, and V medium battalions of the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment were sent to Italian Libya piecemeal. The I and II medium tank battalions with M11/39 tanks were sent in summer and entered the Maletti Group, while the III and V medium tank battalions with M13/40 tanks arrived in October and November and entered the Special Armored Brigade (Brigata Corazzata Speciale, or BCS). Both the Maletti Group and the Special Armored Brigade were part of the ill-fated 10th Army.  Operation Compass  From December 1940 to February 1941, during Operation Compass, the British Western Desert Force overran the 10th Army and occupied Cyrenaica. The I battalion was destroyed in Egypt during the Attack on Nibeiwa, while the II battalion was lost in the fall of Tobruk. The III and V battalions were sacrificed during the failed break out attempt at the Battle of Beda Fomm. After this defeat it was decided to employ the whole Ariete Division in North Africa. On 24 January 1941, the first echelons of the division disembarked at Tripoli. From February 1941 to November 1942, the Ariete Division fought alongside the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK) in the North Africa Campaign. Initially the Ariete was attached to the Italian Mobile Corps (), which later became the Italian XX Motorised Corps.  Siege of Tobruk  In particular, reinforced in 1941 with the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment, which would replace the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, (disbanded in mid-1942), the division took part in the first Axis counter-offensive to retake Cyrenaica, and the following siege of Tobruk. With the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment, equipped with M13/40 and M14/41 tanks the division fought in the Western Desert of Libya and Egypt during 1941. On 1 May 1941 the Germans and Italians attacked Tobruk in considerable strength. Their attack pierced the Australian defences; the Ariete and 8th Bersaglieri captured the R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 strongpoints,Rommel's Army in Africa, Dal McGuirk, p. 91, Stanley Paul, 1987 and XXXII BATTAGLIONE GUASTATORI On 3 May the Australians launched a counter-attack with the 18th Brigade. The counter-attack only recaptured one strong point from what Australian historian Mark Johnston reported to be Italian defenders.That magnificent 9th: An Illustrated History of The 9th Australian Division, Mark Johnston, p. 38, Allen and Unwin, 2002 This action is later known as the Battle of the Salient. During Operation Crusader, the division fought against the British 22nd Armoured Brigade at Bir el Gubi, inflicting heavy losses on the inexperienced British forces. On 23 November, the 15th Panzer Division moved on to attack the 5th South African Brigade defending Sidi Rezegh and that evening, Ariete with the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment, came up in support and the ridge was taken along with 3,400 prisoners.Rommel's Desert Commanders: The Men Who Served The Desert Fox, North Africa, 1941‚Äì1942, Samuel W. Mitcham, p.50, Praeger, 2007 During 29‚Äì30 November, the Ariete and supporting Italian infantry and motorcycle units were responsible for capturing a considerable number of New Zealand, Indian and British troops during the Italo-German counter-attacks. Recalling the loss of the 21st Battalion, Lieutenant-Colonel Howard Kippenberger, who later rose to command the 2nd New Zealand Division, wrote that, When the battle led to the retreat of the Axis forces to the Gazala Line, the Ariete went on the attack, augmented by 23 tanks of the 15th Panzer Division and supported by Bersaglieri motorcycle troops, lost no time in assaulting the pursuing Commonwealth forces. Between them, they overran the 1st Battalion, The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) and part of the 5th Indian Brigade, taking according to one estimate 1,000 prisoners in the counter-attack.Das Afrika Korps: Erwin Rommel and the Germans in Africa, 1941‚Äì43, By Franz Kurowski, p. 125, Stackpole Books (March 2010) The British were able to recover from this setback and the Ariete retreated through the Djebel Mountain towards el Agheila; by this time the division had lost almost all its tanks. Reinforced again with replacement tanks and M40 75/18 mm semoventi assault guns in the V and VI battalions of the 132nd Artillery Regiment, it took part in the second counter-offensive of January 1942, the Gazala battles of May 1942 and the invasion of Egypt that followed.  Battle of Gazala  The Ariete met early success during the Battle of Gazala, when it overran the British-officered 3rd Indian Motor Brigade at Rugbet Al Atasc on 27 May 1942,James J. Sadkovich, Of Myths ad Men: Rommel and the Italians in North Africa, p. 302, The International History Review XIII (1991) capturing 1,000 troops.Das Afrika Korps: Erwin Rommel and the Germans in Africa, 1941‚Äì43, By Franz Kurowski, pg. 125, Stackpole Books (March 1991) The Ariete then repelled strong British armoured counterattacks on 29 May and went on to repeat the same feat on 5 June 1942.James J. Sadkovich, Of Myths ad Men: Rommel and the Italians in North Africa, p. 303, The International History Review XIII (1991)  El Alamein  During the initial phase of the First Battle of El Alamein the Ariete, which had just six or eight tanks and 1,000 men, having just arrived in the positions assigned to it at dawn on 3 July 1942 and due to the disorganization caused by enemy air attacks, had been compelled to withdraw after losing 531 men, several artillery batteries and a number of tanks. Rommel's report of the division having been decimated with the loss of 100 tanks was greatly exaggerated.Rommel's North Africa Campaign: September 1940-november 1942, Jack Greene, Alessandro Massignani, p. 196, Da Capo Press, Revised Edition, (272 pages) During the Second Battle of El Alamein the Ariete sacrificed struggled to counter the Allied offensive and cover the withdrawal of the army. On 4 November at about 15:30, the few surviving tanks were surrounded by an overwhelmingly superior enemy, and general Arena, the division's commander, broadcast this message:Rommel's Desert War: The Life and Death of the Afrika Korps, Samuel W. Mitcham, p. 176, Stackpole Books, 2000 Of three medium tank battalions, a Bersaglieri regiment, two artillery battalions and a self- propelled gun battalion that composed the division at the time, only the XIII Medium Tank battalion and 200 bersaglieri with 6 semoventi survived long enough to be destroyed along the coastal road or near Fuka on 5 and 6 November. Rommel mourned the loss of the division, writing that its final action had been conducted with exemplary courage and that \\"in the Ariete we lost our oldest Italian comrades, from whom we had probably always demanded more than they, with their poor armament, had been capable of performing\\".The Rommel Papers, p. 325 = 135th Armoured Cavalry Division Ariete II = On 21 November 1942, the division was disbanded, and its name kept by a task force gathering up its remnants, which kept fighting throughout the retreat (including a notably successful rearguard action at El Agheila) and subsequent campaign in Tunisia. It was forced to surrender along with the rest of the Axis army in North Africa. On 1 April 1943, as a tribute it was reconstituted as 135 Ariete II Armoured Cavalry Division, made up of cavalry regiments. The division was located in north eastern Italy, with the following order of battle; * 135th Armoured Cavalry Division Ariete II, General Dardano Fenulli ** Armoured Reconnaissance Group \\"Lancieri di Montebello\\" *** Command Squadron *** I Squadrons Group **** Command Squadron (4x AB.41) **** 1st Armored Car Squadron (17x AB.41) **** 2nd Armored Car Squadron (17x AB.41) **** 3rd Motorcycle Squadron *** II Squadrons Group **** Command Squadron (4x Semovente 47/32) **** 4th Motorcycle-machine gun Squadron **** 5th Semoventi Squadron (12x Semovente 75/18) **** 6th Semoventi Squadron (12x Semovente 47/32) *** III Squadrons Group **** Command Squadron **** 7th Anti-aircraft Squadron (12x 20/65 mod. 35 anti-aircraft cannons) **** 8th Ferrying Engineer Squadron (12x Assault boats) ** 10th Armoured Regiment \\"Lancieri di Vittorio Emanuele II\\" *** Command Squadron *** 3x Tank Squadron groups **** 3x Squadrons (10x Semovente 75/18 and 7x M15/42 tanks each) ** 16th Motorised Regiment \\"Cavalleggeri di Lucca\\" *** Command Squadron *** Semoventi Squadron (12x Semoventi 75/18) *** Motorcycle Squadron (4x AB.41) *** 3x Squadron groups **** Command Squadron **** 2x Auto- transported squadrons **** Mortar Squadron (9x 81mm mortars) **** Support Weapons and Anti-aircraft Squadron (4x 20/65 mod. 35 anti-aircraft cannons, 4x Semoventi 75/18) *** Transport Unit ** 135th Armoured Artillery Regiment *** I Motorised Group (12x 50/53 cannons) *** II Motorised Group (12x 100/22 howitzers) *** III Motorised Group (12x 149/19 howitzers) ** 235th Self- propelled Artillery Regiment *** DCI Self-propelled Group (12x Semovente 105/25) *** DCII Self-propelled Group (12x Semovente 105/25) ** CXXXV Self- propelled Anti-tank Battalion (12x Semovente 75/34) ** X Recruits Training Group (12x M15/42 tanks) ** 135th Medical Section ** 135th Supply Section It comprised the following armoured fighting vehicles: * 42x AB.41 * 63x M15/42 tanks * 16x Semovente 47/32 * 126x Semovente 75/18 * 12x Semovente 75/34 * 24x Semovente 105/25 for a total of 247 tank and semoventi plus 42 armoured cars. The division was moved to central Italy following the fall of Benito Mussolini's government and took part to the defence of Rome from 9 to 10 September 1943, counter-attacking German Panzergrenadiers and Paratroopers. Because the Headquarters decided to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and losses, the division was ordered to surrender and was then disbanded.  Reconstitution  = 132nd Armored Division Ariete - 1952 = On 23 May 1948 its reconstitution as a brigade sized unit begins at Forte Pietralata in Rome.

Originally undertaken in 1984, ITRON is a Japanese open standard for a real-time operating system (RTOS) initiated under guidance of Ken Sakamura. This project aims to standardize the RTOS and related specifications for embedded systems, particularly small-scale embedded systems. The ITRON RTOS is targeted for consumer electronic devices, such as mobile phones and fax machines. Various vendors sell their own implementations of the RTOS. Details ITRON, and ¬µITRON (sometimes also spelled uITRON or microITRON) are the name of RTOS specifications coming out of ITRON projects. '¬µ' means that the particular specification is meant for the smaller 8-bit or 16-bit CPU targets. Specifications are available for free. Commercial implementations are available, and offered under many different licenses. On 10 November 2017, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers acquired ownership of the 16- and 32- bit uITRON from TRON Forum. A few sample sources exist, and there are many commercial source offerings, too. Examples of open source RTOSes incorporating an API based on ¬µITRON specification are eCos and RTEMS. ITRON specification is meant for hard real-time embedded RTOS. It is very popular in the embedded market, as there are many applications for it, i.e., devices with the OS embedded inside. For example, there is an ACM Queue interview with Jim Ready, founder of MontaVista (realtime linux company), \\"Interview with Jim Reddy\\", April 2003, ACM Queue. He says in the interview, \\"The single, most successful RTOS in Japan historically is ¬µITRON. This is an indigenous open specification led by Dr. Ken Sakamura of the University of Tokyo. It is an industry standard there.\\" Many Japanese digital cameras, for example, have use ITRON specification OS. Toyota automobile has used ITRON specification OS for engine control. Supported CPUs are numerous. ARM, MIPS, x86, FR-V and many others including CPUs supported by open source RTOS eCos and RTEMS, both of which include the support for ¬µITRON compatible APIs. ITRON's popularity comes from many factors, but one factor is the notion of \\"loose standardization\\": the API specification is at the source level, and does not specify binary API compatibility. This makes it possible for implementers to make use of features of the particular CPU model to which the implementation is targeted. The developer even has the freedom of choosing to pass the parameters using a consolidated packet, or separate parameters to API (system call, library call, etc.). Such freedom is important to make the best use of not so powerful 8-bit or 16-bit CPUs. This makes keeping the binary compatibility among different implementations impossible. This led to the development of T-Kernel in the 2000s in order to promote binary compatibility for middleware distribution. ITRON specification promotion was done by the various companies which sell the commercial implementations. There was also an NPO TRON Association that promoted the specification by publishing it as well as other TRON specification OSes. But since the first quarter of 2010, it has become part of T-Engine Forum, another non-profit organization that promotes other operating system such as the next generation RTOS, T-Kernel. T-Kernel is the name of the specification and at the same time refers to the single implementation based on the authorized source code available from T-Engine Forum for free under T-License. So T-Kernel doesn't suffer from the binary API compatibility. JTRON (Java TRON) is a sub-project of ITRON to allow it to use the Java platform.

Among his debtors were Samuel Oldknow of Marple and Mellor, his friend. He was one of ten known British millionaires in 1799. Biography Richard was born in Bolton. His mother, Patience Holt, died when he was only a few months old, and his father, Sir Richard Arkwright, raised him on his own until he was six, then married Margaret Biggensin, with whom he had a daughter, Susan. The couple divorced a few years later, but Richard Arkwright senior tried to follow the education of his children. His father patented the water frame, a roller-spinning machine powered by water. This was the patented prototype and archetype of a revolutionary wave of mass- production machines for cloth manufacture. Recognition followed of the economy of scale of bulk, quality textiles among consumers and cloth dealers across the world, and thus from investors in turn, making the spinning (together with combing, weaving and various other required stages) of a modern cotton industry the heart of British manufacturing. Cotton and several other raw textile goods were mass-imported from the British Empire to be worked by the export-heavy zones such as the Lancashire Mill Towns and later processed by the linen, drapery and garment, usually factory-based, industries. His namesake Richard Arkwright junior followed in his footsteps; by middle age the latter had developed the factory system further. He was an outstanding organiser of labour and machinery processing, ambitious, forceful and persevering. Richard senior died in 1792 leaving much of his wealth to his daughter (born of his second marriage), her grandchildren and various charities, while the rest, including several factories, was left to Richard, already acting manager. His income streams from the family patent was coupled by well-timed diversification from textiles. In 1799 he was estimated the eight-wealthiest man (or as to others on the list, small aristocratic family unit) in Britain, owning ¬£1M ().\\"Who wants to be a millionaire?\\", The Guardian, feature, 29 Sep 1999 https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/sep/29/features11.g2 He was one of ten known British millionaires in 1799. He decided to invest in real estate and banks, and began to sell some factories to invest in government securities and real estate. This saved him from bankruptcy when a deep depression, acute in industry, came over Britain, after the defeat of Napoleon. In 1804 he became a partner in the bank of John Toplis, and when the latter died in 1829, he took its full possession and financed agricultural landlords (richly speculating and pledging security for coal mining and iron ore projects), contractors and governmental plans: like his father, he financed great works in the transportation sector and railways, including the Cromford Canal. At death, his wealth kept ahead of inflation, being over three million pounds (), some decades before having surpassed the late Richard Crawshay as the richest British person from the bourgeoisie (non-aristocracy). Arkwright was the High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1801.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry (1847)Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal, Marquis of Ruvigny, 1994, .

The painting of Richard junior and his family, painted in 1790, was intended as a pendant to Wright's portrait of Sir Richard, and was thought the best of the four paintings which hung in the Arkwright family estate dining room at Willersley Castle. This painting was on loan and in the collection of Derby Museum and Art Gallery, where it was exhibited next to the one representing his father.

Although their sound is generally classified as indie rock or psychedelic rock, the band have a colourful range of styles and influences, such as 1960s garage rock, country, reggae and jazz. History The Bees have released four albums: 2002's Mercury Prize-nominated Sunshine Hit Me, its 2004 major label follow-up Free the Bees (which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios), and 2007's Octopus. Their fourth album, Every Step's A Yes, was released on 11 October 2010. The first two albums featured songs that have been used in British television advertisements, which are partially responsible for the band's recognition: Sunshine Hit Me's \\"A Minha Menina\\", a cover of an Os Mutantes track (originally by Jorge Ben), appeared in a Citro√´n car commercial and also an advert for Magners Irish Cider, whilst \\"Chicken Payback\\" and \\"Wash in the Rain\\", both from Free the Bees, were incorporated in adverts for Sure Deodorant for Men and Sainsbury's, respectively. \\"Chicken Payback\\" was also used to introduce the Northern comic character Stan Hibbert on Sky's Soccer AM, as well as the 'bed' track for The Radcliffe and Maconie programme on BBC Radio 6 Music. The official video for \\"Chicken Payback\\" featured the band in an arcade-type dance game machine in a Japanese video arcade. The lead character, apparently a rock and roll dance diva, dances so quickly that his shoes catch fire. The song was used in a 60-second flagship advert produced by Karmarama commissioned by Age UK to launch the charity's 2011 \\"Thank You\\" campaign. It was performed by 81-year- old Joy Graham accompanied by a jazz orchestra and was directed by BAFTA winning director Becky Martin of Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show. The Bees supported Oasis in 2005, and Madness in December 2007 during their Christmas tour, and supported Paul Weller in the UK on selected dates of his \\"Winter Arena Tour\\". In 2010, The Bees performed a set for The Sun, covering \\"We Speak No Americano\\" and playing songs from their album, Every Step's A Yes. Paul Butler appeared on stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2010 with Devendra Banhart, after performing two sets of their own. In 2011, The Bees supported Fleet Foxes on their UK tour. One of the influences the Bees have cited is the mind-altering drink called ayahuasca. Butler came to drink this plant medicine with shamans in Peru after being introduced to it by Banhart. \\"The whole thing has brought a lot of joy into my life. I think this kind of cleansing helps with your natural rhythm. Everyone has a song within them or a rhythm that is individual and personal only to you ‚Ä¶ and this kind of activity unlocks that.\\" In 2018, Fletcher and Parkin announced that they had formed a new group, 77:78, and that their debut album Jellies was set to be released through Heavenly Recordings on 5 July.

Ashurst is on the A35 road near the Southampton conurbation. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,011, increasing to 2,093 at the 2011 Census. The parish is on the edge of the designated New Forest National Park area. The village has a campsite, some shops and a railway station. The parish is bounded to the west by Netley Marsh parish and the Bartley Water, to the north by the A326 road and Totton and Eling, and to the south by Denny Lodge parish in the New Forest. Ashurst is close to the City of Southampton and is often considered an exurb of it, a large percentage of its population being commuters. Millvina Dean, the last survivor of the sinking of RMS Titanic, was living in Ashurst at the time of her death in May 2009 at the age of 97. Pubs Ashurst has three pubs; 'The Happy Cheese', 'The Forest Inn' and 'The New Forest Hotel'. A pub named 'The Angry Cheese' used to be located opposite The Happy Cheese, across the road, which became a hairdressers and was eventually demolished to make way for new houses. The original Happy Cheese was a small hotel and restaurant owned by Micheal Leonard. It burned down in 1980 and was rebuilt as the current Happy Cheese pub several years later. In June 2010, The Forest Inn closed after the business went into liquidation. However, it reopened on 12 November 2010 under new management following total refurbishment. Shops and Amenities There are five restaurants along the main road through Ashurst. These are: 'The Jumbo House' Chinese and English takeaway, the 'Little Friar' fish and chip shop, the 'Herb Pot Bistro' (serving many cuisines), The 'Asha' Indian and Bangladeshi restaurant and takeaway, and the 'Lite Bites' sandwich bar. There is also a vet, upholsterer, Post Office, newsagent, two hair salons, a car accessories shop and a car dealer. The post office closed at the end of January 2019. There is also a Welcome food store, part of the Co-operative chain, located further along the main road towards Colbury. Education There are two schools in Ashurst, Foxhills Infant School and Foxhills Junior School. Foxhills Infant School teaches pupils between the ages of four and seven and as of May 2011 had in total 210 pupils on roll. It shares its grounds with Foxhills Junior School, where many of the Infant School pupils progress onto. The Junior School was opened as a middle school in September 1977 when the buildings and facilities of the original Junior School, which had been established ten years previously, were substantially enlarged and extended to provide for the 8-12 middle school age range. In 1993, it became a Junior School once again taking in children aged between 7 and 11. The school had around 332 children on roll in September 2010 and the current Headteacher is Andrew Shore. The majority of pupils come from the neighbouring Foxhills Infants School, Eling Infants School or Hazelwood First School. In its most recent Ofsted inspection report in 2010, it received a Grade 2 (good). Both schools enjoy a 16-acre site with large playgrounds and many resources, including a 6-acre nature reserve with a pond. The reserve, during the last few years, has benefited from a ¬£22K grant from the Millennium Heritage Fund which allowed construction paths and access routes for year-round use. The whole school building area is protected by CCTV and a private patrol company. Also on the same site is Ashurst Pre-School that currently takes 86 children from two years nine months to five years on roll. Transport links Ashurst is well served by transport links, the largest being the Ashurst railway station, run by South West Trains. The line runs from London Waterloo to Weymouth. Ashurst is also on the Bluestar 6 Bus Route (recently replacing the Wilts and Dorset's 56/56A route) that runs from Lymington to Southampton.

He was Fellow and Tutor in Ancient History at New College, Oxford from 1953 to 1977, where he taught scholars including Robin Lane Fox, Robert Parker and Nicholas Richardson. Life De Ste. Croix (Sainte Croix) was born in Macau. His parents were also born in China to British expatriates. His father, Ernest Henry de Ste Croix, who died when he was four, was an official in the Chinese Customs. Their Huguenot ancestors fled to Jersey during the time of Louis XIV. His mother, n√©e Florence Annie MacGowan, was the daughter of a Protestant missionary. He was educated at Clifton College, in Bristol.\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p377: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 He left school at the age of 15 and became an articled clerk, which allowed him to train as a solicitor, without a degree in law. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1932 and practised until 1940. He had a strong physique and was a talented tennis player, competing in the singles and doubles tournament at Wimbledon from 1930 to 1932.http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/draws/archive/players/7bb1b614-b303-472f-8645-212a3e939580/index.html During World War II, he joined the Royal Air Force, and was stationed for a time in Egypt, where he had the opportunity to expand his knowledge of ancient languages. After the war ended, de Ste. Croix studied ancient history at University College, London. From 1950 to 1953 he taught at the London School of Economics and Birkbeck College, before being appointed a fellow of New College, Oxford. He lived at Oxford for the rest of his life. He had a daughter, who predeceased him, from his first marriage (1932‚Äì59). He had two sons from his second marriage. Work Within the circles of classical scholarship, de Ste. Croix--as an exponent of a Marxist epistemological approach--was frequently involved in debate with Sir Moses Finley, an advocate of Weberian societal analysis. The two often exchanged letters and their disagreements were always civil. De Ste. Croix is best known for his books The Origins of the Peloponnesian War (1972) and The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World from the Archaic Age to the Arab Conquests (1981). He was also a noted contributor on the issue of Christian persecution between the reigns of the Roman Emperors Trajan and Diocletian. Of particular note in this regard are the articles written by de Ste. Croix and A. N. Sherwin-White, each challenging the opinions of the other. There were four in total, displaying the light-hearted banter evident also in de Ste. Croix's correspondence with Moses Finley. =The Character of the Athenian Empire= De Ste. Croix's influential article The Character of the Athenian Empire, which first appeared in Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte (1954, 3, pp. 1‚Äì41), provoked a fresh debate about the nature of the Delian League and the Athenian Empire which continues to this day. The article was based on a paper The Alleged Unpopularity of the Athenian Empire delivered to the London Classical Association on 14 June 1950.de Ste Croix, G.E.M. (1954) \\"The character of the Athenian empire\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 3, p. 1. = The Origins of the Peloponnesian War = The Origins of the Peloponnesian War made several major contributions to scholarship on the subject, the major one being a reinterpretation of the Megarian Decree, passed by the Athenian Ekklesia in 432 BC. Most scholarship hitherto had considered the decree to involve economic sanctions by excluding the Megarian state and Megarian traders from access to ports throughout the Athenian Empire. De Ste. Croix instead interpreted it as a religious sanction (drawing an analogy with the Spartan demand, in response to the Megarian Decree and other Athenian policies, for Athens to expel some religiously-tainted citizens). De Ste. Croix maintained that the sanction was exercised not to hurt the Megarians, which it could not do because of the nature of trade and economics in the ancient world, but on religious grounds, which were felt to be genuine by the Athenians. His argument has not achieved general acceptance among historians.Chester Starr, in The American Historical Review (v. 78, no. 3, p. 663) described The Origins of the Peloponnesian War as \\"superb in its argumentation and wrongheaded in its thrust.\\" = The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World = The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World was an attempt to establish the validity of a historical materialist analysis of the ancient Greek and Roman world. It covers the period roughly from Greek pre-classical times to the Arab conquest. Part one addresses fundamental topics. After an expository plan chapter II (Class, Exploitation, and Class Struggle) begins with an apologia of De Ste. Croix's understanding of basic classical Marxist theory (¬ß I The nature of class society) and some specific terms (¬ß II 'Class', 'exploitation', and 'the class struggle' defined). The remainder of Part One is a detailed analysis of these concepts applied to the Ancient Greek World (Chs. III Property and the Propertied and IV Forms of Exploitation in the Ancient Greek World, and the Small Independent Producer). Part II contains the historical analysis per se and begins (Ch. V The Class Struggle in Greek History on the Political Plane) with an exposition of how the economic processes addressed in part I lead to a gradual but complete eradication of Greek democracy by the middle of the Roman principate. The remaining chapters (VI Rome the Suzerain, VII The Class Struggle on the Ideological Plane, and VIII 'The Decline and Fall' of the Roman Empire: an Explanation) focus primarily on Rome and put forth the thesis that it was the increasing dependence on slave labor and diminishment of what would be considered in a modern context the middle classes that was the actual cause of the collapse. There is also a lengthy discussion of the significance of the mode by which surplus value is generated. De Ste. Croix makes the point that the mode of surplus extraction is not necessarily the same as the mode of production engaged in by a majority of the population. Specifically, that while a relatively small portion of the work force were slaves, Rome under the principate nonetheless became essentially a slave society.

Samuel Oldknow Jnr, the eldest son of Samuel Oldknow Sr and Margery Foster, was born 5 October 1756 in Anderton, near Chorley, Lancashire, and died 18 September 1828 at Mellor Lodge, Derbyshire. He had an younger sister named Elizabeth (1758-1762) [according to the grave at Rivington Unitarian Chapel] and a brother, Thomas (c.1755/56-1791 d.aged 35 according to the grave at Mellor Parish Church). Oldknow was educated at the local Rivington Grammar School and later served as an apprentices in his uncle‚Äôs draper‚Äôs shop in Nottingham. His family were members of the Rivington Unitarian Chapel, where his father was interred in 1759 at the age of 25. Following the death of his father, Oldknow's mother Margery continued to live with the children at Roscoe Lowe Farm, one of the properties she had inherited from her father Thomas Foster a local yeoman. Margery later (in 1770) married John Clayton, a farmer, with whom she had three children: Margery, Samuel and John. Oldknow never married; he was at one point in his life engaged to marry the daughter (and heiress) of Peter Drinkwater a textile manufacturer of Manchester, who in 1794 had bought the Manor of Prestwich. The engagement was called off as his business declined and Oldknow died a bachelor. Oldknow continued to have close connections to Rivington. In 1779 he purchased a number of spinning mules (also known as Hall i' th' Wood wheels, invented by Samuel Crompton of Bolton) suitable for use in the manufacture of muslin. He obtained finance of ¬£1,000 from Abraham Crompton, Esq of Chorley Hall with whom he had both church and seemingly some family connection. By 1781 Oldknow had entered into partnership with his brother, Thomas, and he returned to live at Anderton in 1782, expanding into the manufacture of cotton goods. The Oldknow brothers' fabrics became favoured in London, where they formed a business agreement with the merchant Samuel Salte; this was the start of his rise to great success. Oldknow used the putting-out system of production in Anderton near Rivington, whereby raw cotton was distributed to spinners and yarn to weavers who worked in their homes and workshops. The finished cloth was then returned to Oldknow's warehouse for checking and payment. This system was not suited to muslin manufacturing due to production levels and he was forced to purchase yarn from spinners who had taken advantage of mechanised production, such as Richard Arkwright In 1784, financed by a loan of ¬£3,000 from Arkwright, Oldknow joined the great cotton boom in Stockport. There he purchased a house, warehouse and land on Upper Hillgate from Giles Walmsley; allowing him to increase production at lower costs. He concentrated on weaving 50-70 count muslins and calicoes using the putting out system employing up to 300 weavers. Oldknow obtained yarn from a large number and variety of small spinners; some having a single jenny at home to others who had small factories with several mules. By 1786 he had become the foremost muslin manufacturer in Britain, with 300 skilled weavers using 500 looms at Stockport and 159 weavers at Anderton. Oldknow's profits were ¬£17,000 for each year in 1786 and 1787. Quality was an issue. In 1790 mules started to be powered from lineshafts and in the following year Oldknow established his own steam-powered spinning factory at Stockport mills at Hillgate producing 120 count. The Boulton and Watt engine was rated at 8 hp. There was a smaller factory at Carrs in Stockport; a bleaching plant at Heaton Mersey and finishing factories at Bullock Smithy and Waterside in Disley. He continued to keep warehouses at Anderton and Manchester. Spinning worked on the factory system, while weaving operated by putting out. Slowly, ancillary processes such as warping started to be done in the factory by Oldknow, and then weavers were encouraged to move their looms into the loom house before the final stage came when Oldknow provided the looms and employed the weavers on a wage. Samuel Oldknow's warehouse on the Peak Forest Canal In 1787 Oldknow began the purchase large areas of land at Mellor where the first mill, completed in 1790, created work for 2000 people. This new mill used the first Boulton and Watt steam engine for turning the winding machine. Mellor Mill was a brick structure six storeys high and 400 feet long. As part of its construction the River Goyt was diverted, three millponds were created and a system of tunnels, channels and wheelpits built. The millponds still remain and are now known as the \\"Roman Lakes\\". In 1793 Oldknow opened another mill at Mellor and began actively promoting construction of the Peak Forest Canal and the Peak Forest Tramway. Oldknow's business greatly depended on his ability to raise credit (much of which was with the Arkwright family) and it was affected when the muslin market fell, partly as a result of the outbreak of hostilities with France. This downturn resulted in Oldknow mortgaging his estates in Mellor and Marple to Richard Arkwright Junior for a loan of ¬£11,000. Oldknow also had to sell the Heaton Mersey and Anderton operations. Although the Hillgate factory did not come into full production until 1793, Oldknow was by then in financial crisis. He was forced to lease Hillgate in 1794 and had sold it by 1801. Oldknow shifted his operations to Mellor, where he pursued his interest in high farming as well as running a spinning factory. By the early 19th Century the mill had over 500 employees, including a number of parish apprentices who were brought up from London. The mill at Mellor was never particularly profitable, and Oldknow's debt grew, reaching ¬£206,000 at the time of his death. Oldknow's other business ventures included farming, coal mining and production of lime at Mellor and Marple, and he improved communications with nearby industrial centres to sell his products. Oldknow was one of the sponsors of the Peak Forest Canal, which opened in 1804. He also invested in a turnpike road which went to Stockport. Oldknow's farming activities allowed him to supply his workers with milk, meat, vegetables and coal and he also built housing for the workforce. Oldknow used his own system of paper money to pay his workforce which could be exchanged for goods at the village shop or for cash via third parties. He was known as a good employer. Oldknow was a regular worshipper at the Church of All Saints, Marple and is credited for raising the funds for its restoration and rebuilding work which commenced in 1808 and was completed by 1811, with continued improvements to 1816. In 1826, Oldknow donated the land for the building of its Vicarage. Oldknow also served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1824.Marple UK. Retrieved 28 November 2007. In his later years, Oldknow was engaged in his farming interests and, shortly before his death, became President of Derbyshire Agricultural Society. At his death his factory was mortgaged to the Arkwrights and he played a minor role in its running. Following Oldknow's death on 18 September 1828 the factory passed to the Arkwrights. Oldknow's Factory was destroyed by fire in 1892 and although no ground level evidence still exists, there are underground parts of the old mill still present. Oldknow was buried at the Church of All Saints, Marple.

The revolt began on 5 April 1971 and lasted till June 1971. The insurgents were able to capture and hold several towns and rural areas for several weeks until they were recaptured by the armed forces. Even though its first attempt to seize power in 1971 was quickly crushed by force, in 1987 this group launched another far more potent insurgency in the south, central and western regions of the country. Origins Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) became a dominion in 1948 with a conservative government formed under the premiership of D. S. Senanayake who had been instrumental in the negotiations with the British government that lead to self-rule. He founded the United National Party (UNP) by amalgamating three right-leaning pro-dominion parties which won a majority in parliament at the general election. The UNP was defeated in 1956 when S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike became prime minister on a wave of nationalist sentiment. His wife Sirimavo Bandaranaike entered politics following his assassination and became the world's first female prime minister in 1960. Due to successive governments, varying economic policies, regular strikes the economic out look of Ceylon in the 1960s had fallen below what it was when it gained independence in 1948. This had even lead to an attempted coup in 1962. During the late 1960s a movement named as the JVP was initiated by Rohana Wijeweera a former medical student from the Lumumba University and a former functionary of the Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist). He had been at odds with party leaders and impatient with its lack of revolutionary purpose and formed his own movement in 1965 with like minded youth. Wijeweera's apparent expulsion from the Peking-wing of the Ceylonese Communist Party in 1966 triggered him to form his own party followed by his Marxist ideologies which eventually was referred to as the Sinhalese Marxist Group. Along with Wijeweera, three of his close supporters emerged as the leaders of this new movement, these were Sanath, Karunnarathe and Loku Athula. Initially identified simply as the New Left, this group drew on students and unemployed youths from rural areas, most of them in the 16- to 25-year-old range who felt that their economic interests had been neglected by the nation's leftist coalitions. The standard program of indoctrination, the so-called \\"Five Lectures\\", included discussions of Indian imperialism (expansionism), the growing economic crisis, the failure of the island's communist and socialist parties and the need for a sudden, violent seizure of power. Prelude =JVP Preparation= Between 1967 and 1970 the group expanded rapidly, gaining control of the student socialist movement at a number of major university campuses which included the Samajawadi Sisiya Sangamaya (Socialist Student Union) and winning recruits and sympathizers within the armed forces, some of whom actually provided sketches of police stations, airports and military facilities that were important to the initial success of the revolt. In order to draw the newer members more tightly into the organization and to prepare them for a coming confrontation, Wijeweera opened \\"education camps\\" in several remote areas along the south and southwestern coasts. These camps provided training in Marxism-Leninism and basic military skills. The Central Committee was formed at Madampella in 1969. By 1970 a special CID unit under ASP K. C. de Silva was investigating the \\"Che Guevara clique\\", whom then opposition leader Sirima Bandaranaike had made a reference to in her May Day speech in 1970. While developing secret cells and regional commands, Wijeweera's group also began to take a more public role during the elections of 1970. His cadres campaigned openly for the United Front of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, but at the same time distributed posters and pamphlets promising violent rebellion if Bandaranaike did not address the interests of the proletariat. In a manifesto issued during this period, the group used the name Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna for the first time. Because of the subversive tone of these publications, the United National Party government had Wijeweera arrested before the elections in May, but the victorious Bandaranaike ordered his release in July 1970. In the politically tolerant atmosphere of the next few months, as the new government attempted to win over a wide variety of unorthodox leftist groups, the JVP intensified both the public campaign and the private preparations for a revolt. Although their group was relatively small, the members hoped to immobilize the government by selective kidnapping and sudden, simultaneous strikes against the security forces throughout the island. Some of the necessary weapons had been bought with funds supplied by the members. Majority of the party funding came from a string of robberies carried out by the outfit. For the most part, however, they relied on raids against police stations and army camps to secure weapons, and they manufactured their own bombs. By 1970, the JVP had started recruiting and training cadre at camps in Kurunegala, Akmeemana, Tissamaharama, Elpitiya and Anuradhapura. Classes teaching the \\"Five Lectures\\" where being held in various parts of the island mostly in secluded locations such as cemeteries. They had raised a force of around 10,000 full-time members, however had stopped recruiting in 1971. The movement was based on cells of five members with a leader and there were several such cells in a police station area with an area leader. The area leaders selected a district leader to head the district. The district leaders made up the Central Committee. Above the Central Committee was the Politburo made up of 12 people including Wijeweera. All communication was by code by couriers, with the district secretaries communicating the messages from the Politburo met every two months in Colombo. The cells began arming themselves with shotguns, with each member expected to have one with 10 cartridges as well as blue uniforms, military boots and haversacks. Home made bombs were prepared, with some exploding in the process. Such as on 17 December 1970, when Victor Ivan alias 'Podi Athula' lost his left hand and was critically wounded when grenade exploded while being tested. The JVP published its own paper, the \\"Janatha Vimukthi\\" (people's liberation) and carried out several robberies to raise funds such as the Okkampitiya bank robbery, the Badulla mail bag robbery, the Ambalangoda bank robbery and the York Street robbery. Its members were asked to raise funds using personal means. =Ceylon's defense establishment= Since its formation in 1949, the Ceylon's armed forces functioned as an internal security force assisting the Ceylon Police Force during strikes and riots. Following the attempted coup in 1962, the armed forces had faced major cuts in funding and recruitment as well as joint operations. The armed forces were ill-equipped and not prepared for a large scale insurrection. The Ceylon Army had several infantry regiments armed with World War II-era weapons, armored cars, mortars and anti aircraft guns. It lacked tanks, field artillery, sub machine guns and other modern weapons; peace time ammunition stocks were found to be adequate to sustain only one week of offensive operations. The Royal Ceylon Navy, which had suffered the most from the fall out of the attempted coup with recruitment frozen till 1969, had only a single frigate in its fleet. It had to deploy its crew on shore duty and were thereby incapable of preventing the JVP from gaining aid by sea. The Royal Ceylon Air Force had mothballed its jet trainers after plans for introducing jet fighters where scrapped and was limited to a small fleet of light transport aircraft and helicopters, which made up two flying squadrons and a few pilots. =Government's initial response = The Government received multiple warnings of the preparations undertaken by the JVP, yet failed to comprehend the scale of the insurrection that was about to unfold. This resulted in its unpreparedness to counter it. Early warnings came from the Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which had been traditionally tasked with internal security by the late 1969 and early 1970, when they had established the \\"Che Guevara Desk\\" under ASP K. C. de Silva. John Attygalle, the former Inspector General of Police who had been appointed special security advisor to the Ministry of External Affairs and Defence, submitted a report on the potential threat from the new group to Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake's government. The government instructed the police to arrest Wijeweera and he was taken in to custody in May 1970. However, following the 1970 general election, the newly elected Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike had Wijeweera released from police custody. Reports from the previous administration were overlooked. Her new administration undertook changes to the Police force, removing officers and disbanding units perceived to be loyal to the previous administration. These changes effected the CID. The new government was fearful of a potential coup against it from the security forces, lead by officers loyal to the previous administration. Bandaranaike's cousin and a volunteer officer, Captain Anuruddha Ratwatte was promoted Lieutenant Colonel and appointed commanding officer of the Army's Field Security Detachment tasked with identifying such officers. Captain Denzil Kobbekaduwa who lead the investigations instead reported that a more substantial treat to the government was posed from the JVP. Police investigations were started into bomb making factories. =Decision to attack= On 27 February 1971 JVP held its last public rally before the insurrection at Colombo's Hyde Park, here Wijeweera stated that \\"Let the revolution of the workers, farmers and soldiers be triumphant\\". On 5 March 1971, after an accidental explosion in one of the JVP bomb factories killing five members, the police found 58 bombs in a hut in Nelundeniya, Kegalla District. Wijeweera went on to travel around the country, but was arrested on 13 March in Ampara by a special Police team and was later transferred to the Jaffna Prison. On 16 March the government declared a state of emergency, but no military preparedness or mobilization took place. On 2 April a meeting was held at the Sangaramaya (Temple) at Vidyodaya University. The meeting was held by the top leaders of the JVP politburo in response to a request by Wijeweera that posters and leaflets calling for his release be published, and that in the event of the insurgency starting, 500 cadres be sent to Jaffna to break him out of prison. That day the group made up of S.V.A.Piyathilaka, Lionel Bopage, Jayadeva Uyangoda, Sunanda Deshpriya, Loku Athula, W.T. Karunarathne, Susi L. Wickrama, Wijesena Vidanage alias Sanath, Somasiri Kumanayake, and Anura Ranjith Kurukulasooriya decided that all police stations in the country would be attacked on the night of 5 April at 11:00 pm. Since the JVP had considered that local police stations were the governments principle element of power locally. They hoped to remove this presence of power and see the local populaces raise up in their support bring about a revolution. The district leader for Monaragala and Wellawaya was not present at the meeting, the decision to attack was conwayed to them via a telegram that read \\"JVP Appuhamy expired. Funeral 5.\\"'. The Wellawaya leader took the order to attack on the morning of 5 April, and not the evening as had been agreed at the meeting. Insurrection =JVP plan of attack= It was discussed and agreed on 2 April, a countrywide insurrection would be launched on 5 April evening. Four important missions were planned and assigned. Major responsibly of these attacks were entrusted to the student wing, which Wijeweera had once called the \\"Red Guard\\". The first of four important missions, was the attack on the Panagoda Cantonment, which was one of the largest military installations in the country and housed a large arsenal. Piyasiri was in charge of this attack with 800 students, divided into groups of twenty five each assigned to the task. A smaller attack was to be stage on RCyAF Katunayake. The second mission was to abduct the Prime Minister. Attack was to be led by Nimal, Somawansa Amarasinghe, Sanath Kumar and Lal Pieries with over 50 students. Third mission was the capture of the city of Colombo under Bopage. Colombo was divided into five areas, Colombo South, Colombo North, Kandy Road, Colombo Central, and Kotte. The carders were to attack police stations along the way gaining arms and ammunition from these. Key targets were, Welikada Prison, Srawasthi, Radio Ceylon and several residences of government officials such as Justice Minister, Felix Dias Bandaranaike; Army Commander and the IGP. The fourth mission was rescue Wijeweera from prison in Jaffna. =The Wellawaya attack= The planning for the countrywide insurrection was hasty and poorly coordinated; some of the district leaders were not informed until the morning of the uprising. At dawn (5.20 am) on 5 April 1971 the Wellawaya police station came under attack with two police constables were killed. The Wellawaya attack had preempted the initial wave of simultaneous attacks planned by the JVP. They lost the key element of surprise. Following news from the attack in Wellawaya, an alerted government began frantic preparations to face further attacks. A curfew was declared and all police stations were warned of an impending attack, the armed forces began to mobilize by Major General D. S. Attygalle, Commander of the Ceylon Army. After dawn on 5 April, General Attygalle ordered army units of the Gemunu Watch from Diyatalawa to Wellawaya, where the initial attack had taken place. Major Gratian Silva, Army HQ GSO 1 (Ops) and DIG Rudra Rajasingham flew by helicopter to Wellawaya that morning to inspect the ground situation in Wellawaya reporting Attygalle and the Inspector General of Police (IGP). At 7 am, Radio Ceylon reported the attack and warned for further attacks. Several JVP cadres were arrested by the police at Viharamahadevi Park on 5 April as they prepared to abduct or assassinate the Prime Minister at her private residence in Rosemead place. This was follows by a quick city wide curfew and more arrests in Kotahena and Borella with large numbers of bombs, weapons and medical equipment meant to be used in the planned attack on the city. At 8 PM, Major General Attygalle, IGP Stanley Senanayake, Lieutenant Colonel Anuruddha Ratwatte arrived at the Prime Minister's private residence and briefed her on the attack at Wellawaya and impending attack that night. Soon after, Prime Minister left to Temple Trees Prime Minister's official residence accompanied by General Attygalle, Captain A.R.P. (Kalu) Wijeratne and her normal escort. Thereafter Temple Trees became the nerve center for government operations during the crisis and had its security strengthened. It also became a refuge for ministers most of whom were from leftist parties. Helicopter patrols around the capital began as rumors started that the JVP was marching on Colombo. =Initial wave of attacks= With a curfew was imposed and suspects being arrested some of the JVP leaders went into hiding. However the attack commenced as planned 92 police stations across the country were attacked simultaneously by JVP groups armed with shotguns, bombs and Molotov and five, Deniyaya, Uragaha, Rajangane, Kataragama and Warakapola overrun by the insurgents and 43 abandoned by the police for \\"strategic reasons\\" in the days that followed. Fifty-seven police stations were damaged. The insurgents cut telephone and power lines, blocked roads with trees. The Hanwella police station close to Colombo came under attack on 6 April and was beaten off with army reinforcements from the Panagoda Cantonment. The No. 4 Squadron of the Royal Ceylon Air Force deployed its three Bell 206A JetRanger helicopters, which began flying missions to remote police stations to supply the stations with weapons and ammunition. In the following days, the helicopters returned wounded to hospitals. RCyAF Ekala also came under attack. The police withdrew its personnel from smaller police stations. By 10 April the rebels had taken control of Matara District and the city of Ambalangoda in Galle District, and came close to capturing the remaining areas of Southern Province with exception of Galle and Matara which had two old Dutch colonial forts and small army garrisons. However, none of the four major missions planned by the JVP succeeded. The abduction of the Prime Minister failed with arrests of the JVP carders in Colombo on 5 April. Attack on the Panagoda Cantonment never took place as the carders didn't form up and with it the attack on Colombo didn't take place. The attack on Jaffna Prison took place on the night of 5 April with the aim of rescuing Wijeweera. It failed when police reinforcements arrived and arrested many of the attackers, while some were killed. Attacks on the Jaffna police station and Karainagar naval detachment also failed with four of the insurgents were killed on 6 April at Elephant pass. =The government's reaction= The government forces responded with first securing the capital Colombo; other cities and large towns with sizable police and military garrisons. A road blocks were set up, and bridges, ports, and airports were secured, overstretching the small armed forces which had started mobilizing its reservists. Army, navy and air force personnel were deployed on ground duty in a defensive posture at first. In most areas, the police were able to hold out interdependently. Within the first few days the government felt the situation was dire since it was found that its small arms ammunition would run out in a week and fears of infiltration of the armed forces by the JVP members appeared when a navy rating shot fellow ratings in Jaffna. During this time, the JVP took advantage of the weakness of the armed forces and police by capturing large areas of the country uncontested. Many army convoys were ambushed and several initial offensives were pushed back in areas like Matara, where the local member of parliament, Sumanapala Dahanayake, was wounded accompanying the first joint army and police expedition into rebel held areas in Matara. =International assistance= Desperately short of weapons and ammunition, Bandaranaike issued a distress call to friendly countries for support via telegram. The response from many governments were swift. The United Kingdom was the first respond positively, and allowed the Ceylonese government use an Air Ceylon Trident to ferry small arms and ammunition from its bases in Singapore. Pakistan responded with airlifting supplies, troops and helicopters to Ratmalana Airport and took over its defence releasing Ceylonese troops for other duties. India did not properly receive the cable and the Indian High Commissioner in Ceylon was sent back to his country carrying the message for aid from the Government of Ceylon on 13 April. Units from the Indian Army Southern Command were airlifted from Bangalore and Madras (Chennai), to RCyAF Katunayake and five Chetak helicopters 104 Helicopter Squadron followed with more arms and ammunition. 104 Helicopter Squadron logged 573 flying hours spread across as many as 1122 sorties in Ceylon. 150 Indian Gorkhas took over the guarding RCyAF Katunayake and the Indian Navy deployed four frigates setting up a naval cordon around Ceylon since the Royal Ceylon Navy had deployed its sailors on ground operations and harbor defence, latter was later taken over by Indian and Pakistani troops. The RAF heavy transports flew in six Bell 47-G2 helicopters on 17 April, and also ammunition purchased from Singapore. The government also received aid from the Soviet Union, with it flying in five Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17F fighter bombers, a MiG-15 UTI trainer, as well as two Kamov Ka-26 helicopters. Soviet Union also sent 12 light mortars, Yugoslav supplied 4 76 mm mountain guns and China supplied 30 85 mm Type 60 anti-tank guns. The Soviet Union donated 10 BTR-152s, while Ceylon bought 18 Ferret armoured cars from the UK and received several Alvis Saladins. China supplied 30,000 automatic and semi-automatic rifles and Australia provided 5,000 semi-automatic rifles. =Crackdown= Within days of the start of the insurrection, the armed forces began offensive operations after the initial wave of attacks had withered away. Personnel from all three armed services deployed for offensive operations with mobilization of reservists, most of whom were World War II veterans, and with regular troops freed from guard duty as Pakistani and Indian troops took up defense of many key installations. Former Inspector General of Police (IGP) S.A. Dissanayake was appointed Additional Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs and Defence and coordinated the government's defence activities from the situation room at Temple Trees. Local military coordinating officers were appointed from the three branches of the armed forces for each district, tasked with carrying out local counter-insurgency operations. The RCyAF, took out of storage five Hunting Jet Provosts which had been mothballed in 1970, serviced and armed them in three days and flew them from RCyAF Chinabay to RCyAF Katunayake attacking rebel locations en route. Several weeks later the Jet Provosts were joined by the Bell 47-G2 in ground attack missions. With additional supplies flowing in government forces intensified its offensives into insurgent areas. The insurgent who had gained control of large parts of the island from its initial assault, failed to consolidate their holdings or expanding into other areas. Local committees would raise Red flag in the area once it was captured and did little else. Widespread looting and damaging of state property took place and several civilian were murdered by the insurgents. After three weeks of fighting, the government regained control of all but a few remote areas. In most cases the government regained control of townships, insurgent groups melted away in the jungles from which they continued to operate, with some of these pockets lasting into early 1972. The government issued two amnesties in May and June 1971, airdropping leaflets encouraging the insurgents to surrender. Without food, weapons and leadership many youths surrendered while other groups were surrounded and captured. Two of its leaders Sanath (Wijesena Vidanage) and Susil were killed in confrontations with the armed forces and Loku Athula who lead the remnants of his group into the jungles of Wilpathu was wounded and captured in a final confrontation. Large amounts of youth such detailed were sent to detention in rehabilitation camps for months until they were released. Official figure of persons arrested numbered 5,067 of which 1,117 were from Colombo. However some claim the numbers would be has high as 20,000. The government imposed a strict censorship during the period with all domestic and foreign news dispatches censored by the Competent Authority. Aftermath =Casualties= The official death toll was 1200, but unofficial figures reliably estimated it to be around 4000‚Äì5000. 41 civilians were killed by the insurgents. 37 police officers were killed and 195 wounded. 26 armed services personnel were killed (19 army, 4 air force and 3 navy) and 130 were wounded (87 army, 15 air force and 28 navy) from 1971 to 1972. =Prosecution of insurgents= Under the advice of Justice Minister, Felix Dias Bandaranaike, the Prime Minister appointed an Investigation Unit headed by retired IGP Aleric Abeygunawardena to carryout the investigations to prosecute the captured insurgents. The unit was made up of crown counsels and police officers. The crown counsels seconded to it from the Attorney-General‚Äôs Department were granted the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police, in order to take statements of suspects which would be admissible in court. It soon became apparent that it would take years to convict the large number of suspects in custody within the normal procedure and laws of the day. Criminal Justice Commission The Criminal Justice Commission was thus established by the government to prosecute the detained rebels in a expedient manner. It was composed of Chief Justice H N G Fernando (Chairman), Justice A. C. Alles, Justice V T Thamotheram, Justice H Dheragoda and Justice T. W. Rajaratnam. In 1975 Wijeweera was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment later amended to 20 years rigorous imprisonment. Many of the surviving leaders of the JVP received prison sentences, other than those who turned crown witness and gained pardons, including two of the JVP leaders Loku Athula and Somasiri Kumanayake. Most of the youth in rehabilitation camps were released. =Legacy= The insurgency caused 2.7 million rupees worth of damaged to public and private property, while other institutions suffered the loss of 3 million rupees and the RCyAF lost an aircraft. Over 450 million earmarked for capital development was not spent on the indent task due to the insurgency. Ceylon severed diplomatic ties with North Korea in 1971 based on allegations that it supported the JVP, diplomatic relations have not been reestablished since then. Under the six years of emergency rule that followed the uprising, the JVP remained dormant. After the victory of the United National Party in the 1977 elections, however, the new government attempted to broaden its mandate with a period of political tolerance. Wijeweera was freed, the ban on the party was lifted and the JVP entered the arena of legal political competition. As a candidate in the 1982 presidential elections, Wijeweera finished fourth, with more than 250,000 votes (as compared with Jayewardene's 3.2 million). By the late the 1980s the JVP had started a second insurrection lasting from 1987 to 1989. This was more of a low intensity conflict than an open revolution as the first insurrection in 1971. =Investigations into the causes= There are two categories of casual factors. The first is structural: educated unemployment. With rapid population increase and relatively slow economic growth left most youth, who were the beneficiaries of free education, unemployed or engaged in jobs which did not meet their expectation. The unemployment rate was too high when compared to the output of the education system, which the labour market failed to absorb. The second signifying factor is a sequence of political factors: President Jayawardena‚Äôs political strategy of oppressing the opposition; the weakness induced in the main opposition party (SLFP); the subtle exclusion of those who lack political connections from access to state patronage; the Indo-Sri Lankan Peace Accord and the entry of Indian troops to Sri Lanka.

Scientific investigation into generosity has examined the effect of a number of scenarios and games on individuals' generosity, and potential links with neurochemicals such as oxytocin, and relationship with similar feelings, such as that of empathy. Other uses Generosity is sometimes used to denote charity, (the virtue of giving without expecting anything in return). It can involve offering time, assets or talents to aid someone in need. In times of natural disaster, relief efforts are frequently provided, voluntarily, by individuals or groups acting unilaterally in making gifts of time, resources, goods, money, etc. Generosity is a guiding principle for many registered charities, foundations, and non- profit organizations. Although the term generosity often goes hand-in-hand with charity, many people in the public's eye want recognition for their good deeds. Donations are needed to support organizations and committees, however, generosity should not be limited to times of great need such as natural disasters and extreme situations. Mohammed Ayub Khan, the second president of Pakistan presenting Jackie Kennedy a gelding, 1962 Etymology The modern English word generosity derives from the Latin word gener≈çsus, which means \\"of noble birth\\", which itself was passed down to English through the Old French word g√©n√©reux. The Latin stem gener‚Äì is the declensional stem of genus, meaning \\"kin\\", \\"clan\\", \\"race\\", or \\"stock\\", with the root Indo-European meaning of gen being \\"to beget\\". The same root gives the words genesis, gentry, gender, genital, gentile, genealogy, and genius, among others. Romanian Army sharing gifts with children in Afghanistan, 2009 Most recorded English uses of the word generous up to and during the sixteenth century reflect an aristocratic sense of being of noble lineage or high birth. To be generous was literally a way of complying with nobility. During the 17th century, however, the meaning and use of the word began to change. Generosity came increasingly to identify not literal family heritage but a nobility of spirit thought to be associated with high birth‚Äîthat is, with various admirable qualities that could now vary from person to person, depending not on family history but on whether a person actually possessed the qualities. In this way generosity increasingly came in the 17th century to signify a variety of traits of character and action historically associated (whether accurately or not) with the ideals of actual nobility: gallantry, courage, strength, richness, gentleness, and fairness. In addition to describing these diverse human qualities, generous became a word during this period used to describe fertile land, the strength of animal breeds, abundant provisions of food, vibrancy of colors, the strength of liquor, and the potency of medicine. Then, during the 18th century, the meaning of generosity continued to evolve in directions denoting the more specific, contemporary meaning of munificence, open‚Äìhandedness, and liberality in the giving of money and possessions to others. This more specific meaning came to dominate English usage by the 19th century. Over the last five centuries in the English speaking world, generosity developed from being primarily the description of an ascribed status pertaining to the elite nobility to being an achieved mark of admirable personal quality and action capable of being exercised in theory by any person who had learned virtue and noble character (Smith 2009). In religion US Army 1st Sustainment Command wrap Christmas gifts for soldiers stationed in or passing through Kuwait, 2008 In Buddhism, generosity is one of the Ten Perfections and is the antidote to the self-chosen poison called greed. Generosity is known as dƒÅna in the Eastern religious scriptures. In Islam, Quran states that whatever one gives away generously, with the intention of pleasing God, He will replace it. God knows what is in the hearts of men. Say: ‚ÄúTruly, my Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His slaves, and also restricts it) for him, and whatsoever you spend of anything (in God‚Äôs Cause), He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers.‚Äù (Quran 34:39) In Christianity, in the Acts of the Apostles, Paul the Apostle reports that Jesus had said that giving is better than receiving (Acts 20:35), although the gospels do not record this as a saying of Jesus.Jerusalem Bible (1966), Footnote f at Acts 20:35 In his first letter to Timothy, Paul tells rich Christians that they must be \\"generous and willing to share\\". (1 Timothy 6:18) Later Christian tradition further developed the concept of the virtue of charity. =In knowledge= * Missionary Church of Kopimism says that all knowledge is for everyone and copying or sharing information is sacred. * According to the Bible, having all the knowledge in the world is useless, without the desire for charity (sharing): * In the Bible, obstruction of the flow of knowledge is suggested to be the destruction of mankind: * Vidya Daan(‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§®) translated as knowledge charity, a concept in daan, is a tenet of all Dharmic religions that also values the sharing of knowledge. *Gyan yoga/Jnana yoga(‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§® ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó) translated as wisdom exercise or knowledge path, is the sacred search for true knowledge, in all Dharmic religions. * In Hinduism, right knowledge is a form of God, and anything knowledge is written or recorded on is considered sacred, to be protected from obscurity: > ‡§Ö‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ: ‡§ï‡•ã‡§™‡§ø ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂‡•ã‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡§§‡§µ ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡§ø  > ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§µ‡•Ñ‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ö‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•ç  * Translation: Oh Goddess Saraswati, your treasure of knowledge (Vidya) is indeed very amazing! If used(shared) it grows and if unused(obscured) it shrinks! *In Islam, the prophet Muhammad said: \\"Wisdom is the lost property of the faithful; wherever he finds it he has the right to take it\\"Sunan Tirmidhi Tradition:4159, Sunan Ibn Majah Tradition:9784, Ibid Tradition:9785, Mishkat al-Masabih Tradition:216 :Prophet Muhammad also said: \\"Whoever is asked about a knowledge that he knows about and then hides it and keeps it away, he will be bridled on the day of judgement with a bridle of fire.\\"Ahmad, Abu Dawood, and Al-Tirmidhi  Research and scholarship  Research has shown that generosity is associated with empathy. In this research, by Paul J. Zak and colleagues and published in Public Library of Science ONE, the peptide oxytocin or placebo was given to about 100 men and then they made several decisions regarding money. One, the Dictator Game, was used to measure altruism by asking people to make a unilateral transfer of $10 they were given by the experimenters to a stranger in the lab; oxytocin had no effect on altruism. Another task, the Ultimatum Game, was used to measure generosity. In this game, one person was endowed with $10 and was asked to offer some split of it to another person in the lab, all done by computer. If the second person did not like the split, he could reject it (for example, if it was stingy) and both people would get zero. In a clever twist, the researchers told participants they would be randomly chosen to be either the person making the offer or the person responding to it. This required the person making the offer to take the other's perspective explicitly. Generosity was defined as an offer greater than the minimum amount needed for acceptance. Oxytocin increased generosity 80% compared to those on placebo. In addition, oxytocin was quantitatively twice as important in predicting generosity as was altruism. Research indicates that higher-income individuals are less generous than poorer individuals, and that a perceived higher economic inequality leads higher-income individuals to be less generous. The science of generosity initiative at the University of Notre Dame is investigating the sources, origins, and causes of generosity; manifestations and expressions of generosity; and consequences of generosity for both the givers and receivers involved. Generosity for the purposes of this project is defined as the virtue of giving good things to others empathycally and abundantly.

Although the series was not quite as popular as Nancy Drew, Judy Bolton has been called a more complex and believable role model for girls. Judy was also unique in that halfway through the series, she married (something series book heroines rarely, if ever, did). The 38-volume series is the longest-lasting juvenile mystery series written by an individual author. In September 2012, the 39th volume, The Strange Likeness, was published by Applewood books, which has re-printed titles in the series since 1991. In 1968, Sutton had created the title and the beginnings of a plot outline of a mystery located in Panama; however co-authors Kate Duvall and Beverly Hatfield never saw the original outline and wrote the book instead from their original ideas, with the Sutton family's permission. Characters The mainstays of the series were Judy Bolton, auburn-haired girl detective; her brother, news reporter Horace Bolton; her parents, Dr. and Mrs. Bolton; and her loyal black cat, Blackberry. For most of the early volumes she was torn between suitors: the wealthy Arthur Farringdon-Pett, and the upstanding lawyer Peter Dobbs, before finally choosing Peter in volume 10. Her best friend was Peter's sister, Grace Dobbs, also known as Honey; her rival for Arthur's affections was Lorraine Lee. Judy was friends with Arthur's sister, Lois Farringdon-Pett, and one of her high-school archenemies was snobbish Kay Vincent. Judy also befriended a mill worker, Irene Lang, who later became Irene Meredith. Critical assessment Judy Bolton has been called a better feminist role model than Nancy Drew because \\"Nancy Drew is more likely to uphold the ideological status quo, while Judy Bolton is more likely to restore moral rather than legal order, because her mysteries tend to emphasize human relationships over material possessions.\\"Parry (1997), p. 145. Unlike Drew, Bolton often enlists the aid of family members and friends in solving mysteries; she \\"works in a collaborative way that subverts dominant values.\\"Parry (1997), 156. Judy is emotional and self-doubting; for this reason she has been called a \\"more believable\\" female role model.Diane White (1996), 27. As a part of her collaborative approach, Judy is often defined in relation to men: as Dr. Bolton's daughter or later, as Peter Dobbs' wife.Parry (1997), 151. Publication history There were 38 titles in the original Judy Bolton series, all copyrighted between 1932 and 1967. The final 12, particularly the last one, had limited printings and as a result are hard to find. Collectors often find themselves paying upwards of $200 for a volume in good condition. The series ended before the 39th book, The Strange Likeness, could be published.A children's book with that title was published in 1929, written by Harriet Pyne Grove, but is unrelated to the Judy Bolton series. According to author Margaret Sutton, the series was killed due not to poor sales, but to pressure from the Stratemeyer Syndicate. The Stratemeyer Syndicate wished to lessen competition for the Nancy Drew series.Ghent (1987), C1. Pelagie Doane illustrated many of the early Judy Bolton books. During, and after, the course of the series, a number of translations were published internationally. Among these were Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Spanish editions. In 1997, three decades after Grosset & Dunlap issued the last Judy Bolton title, author Linda Joy Singleton completed a book that series creator Margaret Sutton had begun writing several years before.The Book Sleuth. Once the first draft was finished, Singleton submitted it to Sutton for revisions, and the book that emerged from their collaboration carries the name of both co-authors. Chronologically, The Talking Snowman takes place during the Christmas season between the events described in volume 3 and volume 4, and thus is known to collectors as \\"volume 3.5\\". Another title, The Whispering Belltower, was written by Kate Emburg with the encouragement of Margaret Sutton. In 2012, with the permission of Margaret Sutton's family, co- authors Kate Duvall and Beverly Hatfield wrote The Strange Likeness based on Sutton's original title. The book, #39 in the Judy Bolton Mystery Series, was edited by Sutton's youngest daughter, Lindsay Sutton Stroh, and illustrated by another daughter, Marjorie Sutton Eckstein.

He has been described as \\"one of the best known academic Marxists of his generation\\", in this manner being compared with E. P. Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm and Perry Anderson. Miliband was born in Belgium to working-class Polish Jewish immigrants. He fled to Britain in 1940 with his father, to avoid persecution when Nazi Germany invaded Belgium. Learning to speak English and enrolling at the London School of Economics, he became involved in left-wing politics and made a personal commitment to the cause of socialism at the grave of Karl Marx. After serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, he settled in London in 1946 and naturalised as a British subject in 1948. By the 1960s, he was a prominent member of the New Left movement in Britain, which was critical of established socialist governments in the Soviet Union and Central Europe (the Eastern Bloc). He published several books on Marxist theory and the criticism of capitalism, such as Parliamentary Socialism (1961), The State in Capitalist Society (1969), and Marxism and Politics (1977). Both of his sons, David and Ed Miliband, went on to become senior members of the Labour Party following their father's death. David was the British Foreign Secretary from 2007 to 2010, whilst Ed became Energy and Climate Change Secretary and was later elected party leader, serving between 2010 and 2015. Life and career =Early life: 1924‚Äì1940= Miliband's parents had grown up in the impoverished Jewish quarter of Warsaw, Poland. Samuel Miliband had been a member of the socialist Jewish Labour Bund in Warsaw. In 1922, they were among the Polish Jews who migrated westward, to Brussels in Belgium, after the First World War. It was here that Miliband's parents first met, and they married in 1923. His father, Samuel (1895‚Äì1966), was a skilled craftsman who made leather goods, and his mother, Renia (or Ren√©e, n√©e Steinlauf 1901‚Äì1975), travelled around selling women's hats. She was embarrassed by having to work in this profession, hiding it from her neighbours, but required the extra income due to the economic troubles of the Great Depression during the 1930s. Renia spoke Polish fluently, but her husband had only had a very basic education and, as such, probably only spoke Yiddish, but he taught himself French by reading newspapers. Their son, Adolphe, was born in Brussels on 7 January 1924. He grew up in the working-class community of Saint-Gilles, and in 1939, aged 15, he became a member of Hashomer Hatzair (\\"Young Guard\\"), a socialist-Zionist youth group. In May 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War, the armies of Nazi Germany invaded Belgium, and the Miliband family, being Jewish, decided to flee the country from the antisemitic Nazi authorities. They missed the train to Paris and, although Adolphe ‚Äì who was then sixteen ‚Äì wanted to walk to the border, the family recognised that his younger sister Anna H√©l√®ne, who was only twelve, was too young for such a trek. It was decided that Renia and Anna H√©l√®ne would stay in Brussels, while Sam and Ralph would go ahead and make the journey to Paris. However, along the way Sam decided to change the plan and went with his son to Ostend, where they caught the last boat to Britain. They arrived there on 19 May 1940. =Early years in Britain: 1940‚Äì1959= In London, Miliband abandoned the name Adolphe due to its connection with Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and instead began calling himself Ralph. He and his father gained work in the Chiswick area removing furniture from houses bombed in the Blitz and, after six weeks, were able to send news to Renia and Anne-Marie that they were in London. Discovering that the Jews of Belgium were being rounded up by the Nazis, to be sent to extermination camps in the Holocaust, Renia and Anne-Marie managed to escape to a rural farm, where they were hidden by a French family until after the end of the war, when they were reunited with Sam and Ralph. However, several of Miliband's relatives and his best friend, Maurice Tan, were killed in the Holocaust. To his dismay, the teenage Miliband came across antisemitism in London. In a diary entry made shortly after he arrived in Britain, he wrote: > The Englishman is a rabid nationalist. They are perhaps the most nationalist > people in the world ... When you hear the English talk of this war you > sometimes almost want them to lose it to show them how things are. They have > the greatest contempt for the continent in general and for the French in > particular. They didn't like the French before the defeat ... Since the > defeat, they have the greatest contempt for the French Army ... England > first. This slogan is taken for granted by the English people as a whole. To > lose their empire would be the worst possible humiliation. Learning to speak English, Ralph gained a place at Acton Technical College (now Brunel University) in west London with the help of the League of Nations' Commission for Refugees in January 1941. After completing his course there, he gained the help of the Belgian government in exile to study at the London School of Economics (LSE). He had become interested in Marxism and revolutionary socialism, and visited the grave of Marxism's founder Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetery in north London, to swear an oath to \\"the workers' cause\\". Meanwhile, with the constant aerial bombing of London by the Luftwaffe, the LSE was evacuated to the premises of Peterhouse, Cambridge. Harold Laski, the historian and socialist theorist, was a dominant figure in the LSE at this time. Miliband studied under Laski, and was considerably influenced by him politically. Miliband volunteered to be sent to Belgium to assist the resistance movement, and passed his medical in January 1942, but as a Polish national he was not allowed to join until the Polish authorities gave consent. He asked Laski for help in joining the services, and shortly afterwards A. V. Alexander, First Lord of the Admiralty, wrote advising him to \\"go and see a vice-admiral at the Admiralty, who would fix it up\\". Miliband joined the Royal Navy in June 1943. He served for three years in the Belgian Section of the Royal Navy, achieving the rank of chief petty officer. He served on several warships as a German speaking radio intelligence officer in the Mediterranean, tasked with intercepting German radio communications. His initial exhilaration soon wore off as months passed without seeing action, then in June 1944 he took part in supporting the Normandy landings which he wrote was \\"the biggest operation in history\\" and he \\"would not miss it for anything\\". He saw further action at the Toulon landings. After the war, Miliband resumed his studies at the LSE in 1946, and graduated with a first- class degree in 1947. He began a doctorate on Popular Thought in the French Revolution, 1789‚Äì1794 in 1947, but did not complete his thesis until 1956. After obtaining a Leverhulme research scholarship to continue his studies at the LSE, Miliband taught at the Roosevelt College (now Roosevelt University) in Chicago. He became a naturalised British subject on 28 September 1948. In 1949 he was offered an assistant lectureship in political science at the LSE. =New Left: 1960‚Äì1994= Miliband joined the Labour Party in 1951, and was a reluctant Bevanite in the early 1950s. He joined the British New Left, alongside the likes of E. P. Thompson and John Saville, at the New Reasoner in 1958, which became the New Left Review in 1960. Miliband published his first book, Parliamentary Socialism, in 1961, which examined the role that the Labour Party played in British politics and society from a Marxist position, finding it wanting for a lack of radicalism. Paul Blackledge would later claim that it was \\"arguably Miliband's finest work\\". He ended his membership of the Labour Party in the mid-1960s, and subsequently remained independent of formal political affiliation. He began arguing that socialists in Britain had to start working towards building a viable alternative that would be genuinely revolutionary socialist in its positions. He also set up the Socialist Register with Saville in 1964 and was influenced by the American sociologist C. Wright Mills, of whom he had been a friend. He published The State in Capitalist Society in 1969, a study in Marxist political sociology, rejecting the idea that pluralism spread political power, and maintaining that power in Western democracies was concentrated in the hands of a dominant class. Miliband was passionately opposed to American involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1967 he wrote in the Socialist Register that \\"the US has over ... a period of years been engaged ... in the wholesale slaughter of men, women and children, the maiming of many more\\" and that the United States' \\"catalogue of horrors\\" against the Vietnamese people was being done \\"in the name of an enormous lie\\". In the same article, he attacked Harold Wilson for his defence of the United States' action in Vietnam, describing it as being the \\"most shameful chapter in the history of the Labour Party\\". He went on to say that the US government \\"made no secret of the political and diplomatic importance it attached to the unwavering support of a British Labour Government\\". He left the LSE in 1972, having found himself torn by the controversies which had beleaguered the institution over the preceding few years, particularly the LSE's responses to student protests in the late 1960s. He took up the post of Professor of Politics at the University of Leeds. The time at Leeds was an unhappy period for Miliband. He suffered a heart attack soon after the move, and did not enjoy the administrative responsibilities as a head of department. He resigned in 1978, and subsequently chose to assume several posts in Canada and the USA. He took a Professorship at Brandeis University in 1977, and also lectured at other universities in North America, including York University in Toronto and the City University of New York, although he remained based in London. He published Marxism and Politics in 1977, and Capitalist Democracy in Britain in 1982. By now Miliband was active in the Socialist Society with friends such as Tariq Ali and Hilary Wainwright. In 1985, his essay \\"The New Revisionism in Britain\\" appeared in the 25th anniversary issue of the New Left Review in which he responds to writers associated with the Marxism Today magazine such as Eric Hobsbawm and Stuart Hall. Despite their differences, Hobsbawm had been a long-standing friend of Miliband. Miliband's grave in Highgate Cemetery He suffered from cardiac problems in later life, and had a bypass operation in 1991. He died 21 May 1994. aged 70, survived by his wife and sons. He is buried in Highgate Cemetery, close to Karl Marx. His last book, Socialism for a Sceptical Age, was published in 1994, after his death. Personal life Ralph married Polish-born Marion Kozak in September 1961. She was the daughter of a steel manufacturer, David Kozak, with a Polish Jewish heritage, and also one of his former students at the LSE. They made a home in Primrose Hill, and later in Bolton Gardens, South Kensington, and had two sons, David in 1965 and Edward in 1969. =David and Ed Miliband= His two sons both became Labour Party politicians, and in 2007 they became the first siblings to serve together as cabinet ministers since 1938. His elder son, David, was Labour MP for South Shields from 2001 to 2013. From 2005 to 2010 he served in the cabinet, latterly (from 2007) as Foreign Secretary. His younger son, Ed, was elected a Labour MP for the Doncaster North seat in 2005. From 2007 to 2008 he served as Minister for the Third Sector in the Cabinet Office and drafted Labour's manifesto for the 2010 general election. In October 2008 Ed was promoted to the position of Secretary of the newly formed Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). On 25 September 2010, he became the 20th leader of the Labour Party after a leadership contest in which David had also run. The journalist Andy McSmith of The Independent, in comparing the lives of Ralph, David and Ed, said that the elder figure had a \\"nobility and a drama\\" that was lacking in his sons' \\"steady, pragmatic political careers\\". On 27 September 2013, the Daily Mail published an article disputing Ralph Miliband's patriotism with the headline \\"The man who hated Britain\\". Three days later after negotiations the paper published a response by Ed Miliband describing his father's life, and saying the Daily Mail article was character assassination. At the same time as publishing this response, the newspaper reiterated its assertion and published an editorial refusing to apologise. The Labour leader's office responded that Miliband \\"wanted the Daily Mail to treat his late father's reputation fairly. Rather than acknowledge it has smeared his father, the newspaper has repeated its original claim. This simply diminishes the Daily Mail further. It will be for people to judge whether this newspaper's treatment of a war veteran, Jewish refugee from the Nazis and distinguished academic reflects the values and decency we should all expect in our political debate.\\" Ed Miliband's response gained support from across the political spectrum, and was endorsed by the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron. When it was found that a Mail on Sunday reporter had intruded on the private funeral of Ed Miliband's uncle, the newspaper group's proprietor Lord Rothermere and the Sunday paper's editor apologised for this.

In the 19th century it was the base for the pearling fleet. It is now a tourist attraction on Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, Australia, near the Great Barrier Reef. History The area was home to the Mutumui and Walmbaria tribes. The British first settled Bathurst Bay sometime in the early-19th Century. The settlement had few tradable goods because of its climate and terrain. The site became important in the mid- to late-19th Century as an anchorage for the pearling fleet, which was discovering valuable oyster pearls. By the 1890s, the pearling fleet was the only reason for continued settlement. The settlement was destroyed on March 4, 1899 when Cyclone Mahina passed through northern Queensland. Cyclone Mahina was notable for producing the highest recorded storm surge of any tropical cyclone in history. The once-abundant forests have not regrown, mainly because of continuing salt damage to the land by the storm surge. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, Bathurst Bay has become a popular fishing area. Few people have settled the bay area.

Malicious caller identification facility, also called malicious call trace or caller activated malicious call trace, when subscribed or enabled, works by allowing a phone call recipient to mark or flag the preceding phone call connection as malicious (i.e. harassing, threatening, obscene, etc.) The phone system will then automatically trace the call by flagging station to station billing and routing data including start and end times. The call trace is not dependent upon call duration (as envisioned in dramatic movie plots) and will record all meta-data regardless of source conditions - even if the call was made from an unlisted number, a payphone or a number with caller identification disabled. To protect privacy the resulting trace data is only made available to law enforcement. How the user activates this feature depends on their phone system ‚Äî generally it is either in-band-signaling DTMF sequence such as the *57 Vertical service code or a special button attached to their phone generating an out-of-band signal. For analogue services, many exchanges will interpret DTMF sequences to activate POTS. Digital services, such as ISDN or GSM, enable the CPE to activate MCI via out-of-band signaling. Often with PABXs with analogue phone connections, the PABX will interpret the DTMF and then activate the out-of- band signaling. MCI is the ETSI standard, whereas MCT is the American one. They both do more or less the same thing though. In Canada, the service is usually marketed as call trace, and fees generally only apply when the service is used.

Previously he had founded New Life World Wide Inc. In 1967 he began publishing Truth Journal Magazine which has now been in continuous publication for 44 years. By 1970 he had authored nine books. Davis continued to teach in the Kriya Yoga tradition for more than 60 years. Biography Born in Leavittsburg, Ohio, Davis became interested in yoga at a young age. He read the book Autobiography of a Yogi when he was 18 and was attracted to kriya yoga and the author, Paramahansa Yogananda, who he \\"knew was his guru\\". After studying lessons from Yogananda's Self-Realization Fellowship and graduating from high school, he met Yogananda in 1949 and joined the monastic students at Yogananda's SRF. In 1951, he was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda. In 1952 he was \\"appointed Minister of the SRF Center in Phoenix, Arizona\\", teaching kriya yoga. He left SRF and served in the US Army Medical Corps at Fort Riley from 1953 through 1955. Following his military duty he began his ministry as an independent spiritual teacher. In the 1960s he founded New Life Worldwide. He began publishing the Truth Journal magazine in 1967.

He was the grandson of Genghis Khan and the brother of G√ºy√ºk Khan. During the Mongol invasion of Europe, Kadan, along with Baidar (son of Chagatai Khan) and Orda Khan (the eldest brother of Batu Khan and khan of the White Horde), led the Mongol diversionary force that attacked Poland, while the main Mongol force struck the Kingdom of Hungary. In early 1241, Kadan's forces sacked the Polish towns of Lublin, Zawichost and Sandomierz. Kadan then attacked Masovia, while Baidar burned the evacuated Polish capital, Krak√≥w and then Bytom, and Orda Khan assaulted the southwestern border of Lithuania. The three leaders were then to attack the Silesian capital Wroc≈Çaw. Baidar began to besiege the town, but marched north with Kadan and Orda to Legnica to defeat the forces of Henry II the Pious, Duke of Silesia and High Duke of Poland, before he could join King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia. After defeating some forces of Konrad I of Masovia, Kadan's forces joined with Baidar's and Orda's at Legnica. The Christian army was crushed in the ensuing Battle of Legnica of April 9, 1241. Mongol casualties were heavier than expected in the battle, however, and Kadan was reluctant to directly attack Wenceslaus' Bohemian forces. Kadan and Baidar skirmished against the Bohemians and were able to prevent the Bohemian king from helping King B√©la IV of Hungary. After raiding Moravia, the Mongol diversionary force went to Hungary. Qadan's siege of Olmuc. During the winter of 1241‚Äì42, Kadan sacked Buda on the way to Gy≈ër. While besieging Italian mercenaries defending Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Kadan was forced to withdraw his troops after an early thaw flooded the land around the town. The Mongol prince was then sent south with one tumen to search for B√©la in Croatia. Kadan first sought the Hungarian king at Zagreb, which he sacked, and then pursued him into Dalmatia. While B√©la hid at Trogir, Mongols under the leadership of Kadan, in March 1242 at Klis Fortress in Croatia, experienced their first European military failure, while in pursuit for the head of B√©la IV of Hungary.Pro≈°lost Klisa Kadan had his Hungarian prisoners executed as supplies began to run out. To the king's surprise, Kadan headed south past Trogir toward Dubrovnik (Ragusa). While he was nearing Scutari, Kadan heard of the death of his father, √ñgedei Khan. Kadan's raids through Bulgaria on his retreat from Central Europe induced the young Kaliman I of Bulgaria to pay tribute and accept Batu Khan as his liege. In 1251 Kadan accepted the election of M√∂ngke Khan as Khagan. According to Ren√© Grousset, he probably helped the latter to capture Eljigidei, the chief general of G√ºy√ºk. Kadan was loyal to Kublai Khan and supported his army against Ariq B√∂ke in the Toluid Civil War. He commanded Mongol army at the first engagement with Ariq B√∂ke and killed his general Alandar. In many medieval sources, Kadan was mistranslated by chroniclers as Kaidu, leading to confusion about who participated in the European campaign.Chambers, James.

Giriraja has produced many of the important cultural figures of South India. Among the greatest of those was Tyagaraja, whose mother was a daughter of Giriraja Kavi. He was named after the presiding deity of the main temple of that town. Giriraja Kavi played a major role in influencing the formative years of his celebrated grandson Tyagaraja. He was instrumental in securing a place at court for his grandson, a position that Tyagaraja soon abjured.

The play is regarded as an early herald of a shift in audience tastes away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of sentimental comedy. It is often described as \\"opportunistic\\" (Hume), containing as it does something for everybody: daring Restoration comedy sex scenes, sentimental reconciliations, and broad farce.

Synopsis Love's Last Shift is the story of a last \\"shift\\" or trick that a virtuous wife, Amanda, is driven to, in order to reform and retain her out-of-control rakish husband Loveless. Loveless has been away for ten years, dividing his time between the brothel and the bottle, and no longer recognizes his wife when he returns to London. Acting the part of a high-class prostitute, Amanda invites Loveless into her luxurious house and treats him to the night of his dreams, confessing her true identity in the morning. Loveless is so impressed by her faithfulness that he immediately becomes a reformed character. A minor part which was a great success with the premi√®re audience is the fop Sir Novelty Fashion, written by Cibber for himself to play. Sir Novelty flirts with all the women, but is more interested in his own exquisite appearance and witticisms, and, writes Cibber modestly in his autobiography 45 years later, \\"was thought a good portrait of the foppery then in fashion\\". The play was a great box office hit at the premi√®re run but has not stood the test of time. Theatre historians today remember it, if at all, because of John Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, or, Virtue in Danger, still a stage favourite, where the husband returns to polygamy.

DuBois has claimed to have used her psychic abilities to assist U.S. law enforcement officials in solving crimes, forming the basis of the TV series Medium. Her powers as a medium were tested by Gary Schwartz of the University of Arizona. Schwartz claimed that his research supports DuBois's psychic abilities, while skeptics have pointed out flaws in both DuBois's claims and Schwartz's research. A show called Medium was based on Allison's experiences and she is a consultant for the show. She claims she has visions, of both the past and the future, but it's mainly the dreams that allegedly help the police solve crimes. Early life DuBois was born in Phoenix, Arizona, where she attended both North High School in Phoenix and Corona del Sol High School in Tempe. Despite dropping out, she obtained her GED at the age of 16.Irwin, Megan There's no good proof the real Medium, Allison DuBois, has ever cracked a case, but her fans don't care June 10, 2008 Phoenix New Times Page 3: Though she attended both North High School in Phoenix and Corona del Sol in Tempe, she graduated from neither. Instead, she dropped out and got her GED at 16. In college, she worked as an intern at the district attorney's office in Phoenix. She received her B.A. in political science with a minor in history from Arizona State University. Career DuBois refers to herself as a medium and profiler, rather than a psychic, because of the negative connotation she feels is associated with the term \\"psychic\\". She claims that she became aware that she had the ability to communicate with departed souls when she was 6 years old. DuBois claims she uses this ability to connect deceased loved ones to the living, and also to help law enforcement agencies solve crimes, such as the Texas Rangers and the Glendale, Arizona police department, and that she used these abilities as a jury consultant.Patricia Arquette channels real-life psychic Allison DuBois‚Äîand the dead‚Äîin NBC's Medium These law enforcement agencies have since either denied any such cooperation happened or stated the tips provided by DuBois were not helpful.Irwin, Megan There's no good proof the real Medium, Allison DuBois, has ever cracked a case, but her fans don't care June 10, 2008 Phoenix New Times According to the TV Guide, Allison DuBois spent four years participating in various tests at the University of Arizona to assist with their studies of mediums and psychic phenomena. Gary Schwartz, Director of The VERITAS Research Project, claims that DuBois has psychic abilities, arguing in the March 6, 2005 TV Guide, \\"Anyone who's looked closely at the evidence can't help but come to the conclusion that there is something very real going on here.\\" At their first meeting, Schwartz says DuBois accurately described a friend of Schwartz's who had just died. Impressed, Schwartz conducted a series of interviews, including one in which DuBois stated she contacted the late husband of a woman in England, knowing only the woman's name. The woman, after reading a transcript of the session, affirmed that 80% of what DuBois said was accurate.\\"Is Medium's Psychic the Real Deal?\\", TV Guide Schwartz published his research in a book titled The Truth About Medium. According to a statement by DuBois, she does not endorse the book or Schwartz.Editorial Commentary Internet Archive, Retrieved February 9, 2007 =Medium= The television drama Medium, which aired from 2005 until 2011 on NBC and CBS is based on Allison DuBois's book, Don't Kiss Them Good-Bye. The show was created by Glenn Gordon Caron, creator of Moonlighting and other television shows, who is also one of the writers for the series. It is produced by CBS Television Studios (having acquired the TV production arm of original producer Paramount Pictures) and Grammnet, the production company owned by Cheers and Frasier alumnus Kelsey Grammer. Patricia Arquette was cast to play the role of DuBois, at the suggestion of Caron's girlfriend. DuBois stated in the January 9, 2005 TV Guide that she initially thought Arquette was too liberal to play her, remarking, \\"I mean, I have a gun, I have put people on death row. I wanted to make sure that was something that didn't bother her. But she assured me that she believed some people may have that coming.\\" \\"Every episode is not a biography of my life, it is simply based on my life experiences. It is an accurate portrayal of my life and the people who share it with a little Hollywood magic thrown in,\\" DuBois has said. She does state in both her book and in the edition of January 3, 2005 of Sci Fi Weekly that the program closely resembles the truth of her own life. Several details of Arquette's character match DuBois's life, such as the name of her husband on the show (Joe) and the fact that he is an aerospace engineer. Both the character and the real-life DuBois have three daughters, and the first case the character \\"consults\\" on in the show's pilot is with the Texas Rangers, the law enforcement agency with whom the real-life DuBois alleges she first worked. Criticism Skeptics such as Paul Kurtz and Ray Hyman say that DuBois does not have psychic powers. Skeptic James Randi says that people such as DuBois give the appearance of psychic powers through cold reading techniques. For example, DuBois, when doing her first reading of Schwartz, told him that his deceased friend was telling her, \\"I don't walk alone,\\" which Schwartz understood to be a reference to his friend's confinement to a wheelchair, which DuBois could not have known about. Randi says that Schwartz leapt to an unsupportable conclusion, since the notion of \\"not walking alone\\" can mean any number of things, and \\"certainly does not describe being in a wheelchair\\". Randi also asserts that experiments that allegedly yield positive results of psychic powers, such as the ones done with DuBois, are not conducted using proper scientific controls.Commentary of the JREF March 30, 2001 In light of Schwartz's assertion that \\"some\\" of his experiments with DuBois were performed under such conditions, Randi questions why the rest of them were not, and points to a report demonstrating that a few of Schwartz's experiments were not performed according to standard scientific protocol.Newsletter of the JREF January 21, 2005 Schwartz's point-by-point response to Randi's criticisms was published in 2005.\\"A Reply to Randi, by Dr Gary Schwartz\\", Daily Grail, April 15, 2005 In 2005, Randi offered to have DuBois tested for his One Million Dollar Challenge. According to Randi, DuBois declined his invitation to the challenge.Commentary of the JREF April 8, 2005 In 2011, the JREF again issued the million dollar challenge to James Van Praagh, Allison DuBois, Sylvia Browne, Carla Baron, John Edward, and others to prove their abilities in controlled experiments, commenting, \\"James Van Praagh and Allison DuBois have turned the huckster art of 'cold reading' into a multi-million-dollar industry, preying on families' deepest fears and regrets,\\" he says in a statement announcing the challenge. \\"They should be embarrassed by the transparent performances.\\" Former FBI profiler, behavioral science expert and MSNBC analyst Clint Van Zandt challenges statements about psychics helping law enforcement arguing, \\"If psychics were truly successful and if their results were not simply the consequence of trickery (at worse [sic]) or good interviewing skills (at best), then why don't law enforcement agencies have psychic detective squads, a real X-Files Unit, or other ways to integrate these paranormal investigative capabilities?\\" Personal life DuBois's parents, Mike Gomez and Tienna DuBois, divorced when she was a baby. Tienna remarried and divorced again when Allison was 12. In her first book, DuBois writes about seeing her stepdad in public with his new family. DuBois is married to Joe Klupar and they have three daughters: Aurora, Fallon, and Sophia.Irwin, Megan. \\"There's no good proof the real Medium, Allison DuBois, has ever cracked a case, but her fans don't care\\", Phoenix New Times, June 12, 2008 DuBois believes that her daughters share her psychic abilities. In 2010, DuBois made an appearance in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills at a dinner party hosted by Camille Grammer.

Route 1 continues to serve as the most direct route from the north shore of Hong Kong Island to the Southern District. The road travels across the harbour and runs through the middle of Kowloon and continues heading north into the New Territories. History Route 1 was established in January 2004 when the third generation of route numbers came into use, replacing the old system which had been used since 1974. Cross-Harbour Tunnel Route The route begins in the south at Aberdeen Praya Road which continues as Wong Chuk Hang Road until reaching the Aberdeen Tunnel. The traffic runs on the Canal Road viaduct after exiting the tunnel in Happy Valley. The viaduct descends to the ground level passed the intersection at Gloucester Road for Route 4 to Tin Hau, North Point and Eastern Harbour Crossing. Traffic then crosses the Cross-Harbour Tunnel into Kowloon and keeps heading north along Princess Margaret Road and Waterloo Road. The stretch of Waterloo Road between Hereford Road and Lancashire Road in Kowloon Tong is the only section of the route that is not controlled access. Traffic then climbs a steep incline to reach the Lion Rock Tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, the road skirts the border of Tai Wai. The route becomes an expressway in Sha Tin for the remaining 3 km. Traffic has an option to merge to Route 9 in Sha Tin or branch off onto Route 2 for Ma On Shan.

He was reputedly the wealthiest man in Great Britain. He profited from slave plantations in North America, and invested in building developments in Great Britain, including the Pulteney Bridge and other buildings in Bath, buildings on the sea-front at Weymouth in Dorset, and roads in his native Scotland. He was a patron of architect Robert Adam and civil engineer Thomas Telford. Early life William Johnstone, as he was born, was the second son of Sir James Johnstone, 3rd Baronet of Wester Hall, Dumfries, and his wife Barbara Murray, the oldest sister of the literary patron Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank. His older brother was the soldier and politician Sir James Johnstone, 4th Baronet. His younger brothers included the politician and naval officer George Johnstone and the East India Company official John Johnstone. Alexander Murray of Elibank, a Jacobite, was his uncle. He studied law, became a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1751, and went on to become an eminent advocate. He lived in Edinburgh and associated with several major figures of the country's learned society, including philosopher and historian David Hume, political philosopher and economist Adam Smith, and architect Robert Adam. He was a brother of Commodore George Johnstone and first cousin of Patrick Ferguson. Marriage and name change On 10 November 1760, he married heiress Frances Pulteney. Frances was the third daughter of MP and government official Daniel Pulteney and first cousin once removed of William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. She inherited William‚Äôs substantial fortune and estates close to Bath in Somerset after his death in 1764 and that of his younger brother and heir in 1767. On inheriting, Johnstone changed his name in 1767 to Pulteney. Simultaneously, his daughter‚Äôs name was also changed from Henrietta Laura Johnstone to Henrietta Laura Pulteney. Pulteney Bridge At that time Bath was expanding, but the Pulteneys' rural Bathwick estate was separated from the city by the River Avon, and with no bridge in place the only means of crossing the river was via a small ferry. They decided a bridge needed to be built, and Pulteney turned to his friend and fellow countryman, architect Robert Adam. Adam was influenced by his travels to Florence and Venice and proposed a bridge incorporating shops along both sides. This was completed in 1773, but the Pulteneys' original plans for Bath's expansion did not take effect until 1788 when Bath architect Thomas Baldwin started to create a new estate. As well as the bridge bearing their name, the Pulteneys‚Äô involvement is recalled by Great Pulteney Street in Bathwick, reputed to be the longest boulevard of its kind in Europe, while Henrietta Street was named after their daughter. Parliamentarian Pulteney represented Cromarty and later Shrewsbury, where he usually resided, in seven successive Parliaments. He first but unsuccessfully contested the Shrewsbury seat in 1768, but subsequently won the seat for Cromarty (losing this to Cosmo Gordon in 1774).http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/gordon- cosmo-1736-1800 In 1774 he again contested Shrewsbury, and although he was defeated, he was returned on petition the following March (and retained the seat until his death in May 1805). On 1 June 1782, his wife Frances died, leaving him her fortune. US landowner Pulteney invested in land in the West Indies and in what is today western New York state. The settlements of Bath, Pulteney, Henrietta and Caledonia are evidence of his speculation at the end of the 18th century, through 'The Pulteney Association' an agency run by his agent Charles Williamson. Patron of Thomas Telford In 1783, Pulteney began working with Thomas Telford, later the most eminent civil engineer of his day. When Pulteney first met him, Telford was a young stonemason from the same parish of Westerkirk in Dumfries, who had travelled to London to seek work. In 1787, Pulteney commissioned Telford to supervise restoration works at Shrewsbury Castle, following Robert Adam's designsGareth Williams, The Hidden Hand of Genius; Robert Adam & The Pulteney Estate in Shropshire, in Georgian Group Journal vol. XXIV pp.65-80 and helped his appointment as Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Later, as Governor of the British Fisheries Society, Pulteney appointed Telford to design the world‚Äôs then-largest herring fishing port, at Wick in Caithness. The village was named Pulteneytown and is the location of the Old Pulteney whisky distillery. Pulteney was also influential in Telford's 1801 appointment to devise a master plan to improve communications in the Highlands of Scotland, a massive project that was to last 20 years. Pulteney also took a lively interest in many other engineering projects, including that of Bell Rock lighthouse, supporting a bill in 1803. Family legacy He succeeded to the Johnstone baronetcy in 1794 on the death of his elder brother James Johnstone. He was thus titled 5th Baronet Pulteney, having declined several offers of a peerage during his parliamentary career. In 1804 Pulteney married, as his second wife, Margaret, widow of Andrew Stuart and daughter of Sir William Stirling. The marriage did not last long. Pulteney died intestate at Bath House in Piccadilly, London, on 30 May 1805, and was buried at Westminster Abbey. His daughter, (Henrietta) Laura, was created 1st Baroness of Bath on 26 July 1792 and 1st Countess of Bath on 26 October 1803. In 1794, she had married her father's first cousin Sir James Murray, who had taken the name Murray-Pulteney. She died on 14 July 1808 without bearing children and her titles became extinct.

It is a small Skipper (butterfly) with a chequered pattern on its wings that appears to be black and white. This butterfly can be found throughout Europe and is heavily concentrated in central and southern regions of England. The butterfly prefers three major types of habitat: woodland, grassland, and industrial. Referenced as a superspecies, Pyrgus malvae includes three semispecies: malvae, malvoides, and melotis. Eggs are laid on plants that will provide warmth and proper nutrition for development, such as A. euphoria. As larvae, their movement is usually restricted to a single plant, on which they will build tents, unless they move onto a second host plant. Larvae then spin cocoons, usually on the last host plant they have occupied, where they remain until spring. Upon emerging as adult butterflies, grizzled skippers are quite active during the day and tend to favour blue or violet-coloured plants for food. They also possess multiple methods of communication; for example, vibrations are used to communicate with ants, and chemical secretions play a role in mating. Exhibiting territorial behaviour, males apply perching and patrolling strategies to mate with a desired female.  Taxonomy/phylogeny  A semispecies, Pyrgus malvoides, of the Pyrgus malvae superspecies In terms of a species complex, Pyrgus malvae is considered a superspecies that consists of three semispecies, which exhibit geographic variations in the genitalia of both male and female butterflies. These three semispecies are considered to be the Pyrgus malvae, Pyrgus malvoides, and Pyrgus melotis types. This classification can also be described as a monophyletic clade. Significant isolation mechanisms exist to accentuate the division between the malvae type and melotis type, more than the difference between the malvae and malvoides types. In fact, interbreeding has been observed between the malvae and malvoides types, indicating their close relation - namely that they are both part of the same species. thumb1- Grizzled Skipper 2- Dingy Skipper 3- Large Skipper 4- Small Skipper left  Description  With its characteristic chequered black-and-white pattern, the grizzled skipper is quite distinctive. It is small, with an average forewing diameter of 12 millimeters, and closely resembles moths in appearance. Males and females can be differentiated by the shape of their wings: males have slightly more angular wings, while females have a more rounded wing shape. Larvae are coloured green and light brown with darker brown stripes.  Geographic range  Pygrus malvae can be found throughout Western Europe in northern Scandinavia, parts of Greece, and some of the Mediterranean Islands. Its populations in many European countries appear to be quite stable. It is also present in Korea, as well as throughout the Mediterranean up to Middle Finland, and rarely in parts of Germany.  Habitat  Although grizzled skippers occupy three major forms of habitats, they tend to settle in environments with spring nectar plants, larval food plants (agrimony, creeping cinquefoil, wild strawberry, tormentil), ranker vegetation, and edges with scrub or woodland. Host plants are from the family Rosaceae with a focus on Agrimonia eupatoria as well as Potentilla. Woodland: This mainly consists of sparsely distributed vegetation and can have regions of bare ground that result from cutting or windblow. Grassland: These can result from three different patterns that involve animal grazing, scrub cutting, or disturbance by animals: 1) Scrubby grassland that includes bramble and wild strawberry 2) Unimproved grassland that include creeping cinquefoil 3) Unimproved grassland that includes agrimony. Industrial: Sparse vegetation with mainly wild strawberry or creeping cinquefoil depending on whether the environment is along a railway or clay working. These environments have typically been abandoned fairly recently. Other possible environments for the butterflies are heathland, shingle, sand dunes, and acidic, neutral and marshy grassland.  Food resources  = Adult food preference = Grizzled skipper feeding behaviour shows some preference for flowers with blue and violet colouration.Studies support a concentrated preference for specifically coloured flowers by grizzled skippers. They are most attracted to blue and violet while showing little or no attraction to white, yellow, or red. Butterflies have ultraviolet and blue receptors that may be responsible for Hesperiidae butterflies favoring blue. This evidence indicates that when butterflies from this species forage for food, they are particularly attentive to short-wavelength light that is reflected off flowers. In fact, this particular preference aligns with a prominent attentiveness that members of Hesperiidae have for blue. This preference may be a result of phylogenetic adaptations, foraging signals, and learning abilities. Specifically, the prevalence of blue flowers in lowlands could further intensify this preference, especially for grizzled skippers that tend to be found in lowland grasslands.  Parental care  = Host plant preference/selection = An overarching theme in behavioral ecology can be seen through female grizzled skipper investment in host plant selection. Females tend to lay eggs on host plants that are viewed as larger and more nutritionally rich. However, this nutritional advantage for caterpillars must be balanced with the presence of a warm microclimate that is suitable for the species. Warm microclimates align with P. tabernaemontani plants, but these may also have an increased chance of desiccation. On the other hand, A. eupatoria is a larger plant when near molehills and can be found in more suitable environments. As a result, A. eupatoria provides an appropriate balance for both of these requirements and is preferred as a host plant by P. malvae, particularly near molehills. Females consider optical conspicuousness, or plant visibility, through prominence (height differences between host plants and vegetation). More prominent host plants, like A. eupatoria over P. tabernaemontani, are favored. However, these two different habitats are used significantly and may be evolutionary adaptations to offset the grizzled skippers‚Äô risk of extinction imposed by a polarized weather pattern.  Life history  = Egg = Eggs are mainly found on agrimony, creeping cinquefoil, and wild strawberry plants, which provide nourishment for larvae. Other plants that can be considered include barren strawberry, tormentil, salad burnet, bramble, dog rose, and wood avens. Plants favored by mothers are typically located in bare ground or short vegetation environments, can have high nitrogen contents, and tend to be located in warmer microclimates. The eggs for grizzled skippers are laid one at a time, although females can lay them on more than two species of plants. Preferred plants have been observed to contain up to 22 eggs. = Larva = This stage continues for two to three months in its entirety. At first, larvae live and spend the vast majority of their time within ‚Äòtents‚Äô that they build on the host leaf, and this partially feeds into their restricted mobility. The two reasons for leaving this shelter are 1.) to feed on another leaf, or 2.) to create another tent. Later on in this stage, larvae expand their mobility and are no longer restricted in diet or habitat. Plants that are higher in nitrogen content and nutrition are more highly incorporated into the diets of larger larvae, as are coarser shrubs. Host plants located on molehills are favored for early larval stages due to open vegetation that is available as well as bare ground and warmer microclimates. = Pupa = Pupal cocoons spun by larvae can be located on or within low vegetation. Generally, these cocoons are not found near the larvae's last tent. The location of these cocoons can consequently affect adult emergence patterns. Pupal cocoons on shorter vegetation will facilitate adult emergence earlier in the spring than pupal cocoons on longer vegetation. = Adult = Grizzled skippers produce one brood per season and are in flight from the middle of March to the middle of July. Active during the day and focused on feeding or basking, they roost on tall vegetation like marjoram, knapweed, and St John's-wort. In particular, adults spend days basking on bare ground and afternoons on taller vegetation. This provides them favorable microclimates and visibility.  Migration  = Location or regional dispersal = Butterflies move away from open spaces to the case of increasing wind speeds to seek shelter. Shelter may be particularly important because of vegetation; for example, they can support herbs and bramble. They are also useful in connecting multiple separated habitats. In fact, shelters are associated with higher activity amongst the butterflies.  Enemies  = Predators = Grizzled skippers belong in family Hesperiidae, but another group of butterflies (family Lycaenidae) uses the mechanism of wing expansion to produce vibrations and communicate with ants. Similar to this behavior, grizzled skippers also produce vibrations upon expanding their wings. This resembles the ‚Äòant-attendant‚Äô behaviour that is specific to butterflies in the Lycaenidae. Ants are recognized as potential predators for lycaenid caterpillars, therefore, vibration signaling most likely functions as an anti-predatory survival mechanism. Similarly, grizzled skippers also exhibit this kind of vibratory communication. Although the behavior is absent during the caterpillar stage, grizzled skippers are able to produce vibrations upon wing expansion. Akin to lycaenids, grizzled skippers may use these vibrations as signals to communicate with ants and potentially as an attempt to temper aggression.  Mating behaviour  Mating behaviour of Pyrgus malvae = Female/male interactions =  Pheromones  Grizzled skippers are known to contain organs called androconia that are responsible for producing chemicals within the thorax as well as the abdomen. They are found in males at the forewing costal fold. The organs release sex pheromones that can be used as a sexual recognition mechanism and drive evolution. The process involves the male first locating a female visually, then using low concentrations of the pheromones at a relatively close proximity to indicate its viability as a mate. While courting the female, male butterflies have specialized hairlike structures called ‚Äòtibial tufts‚Äô on their hind legs that can be used to steer these chemicals directly to the female. However, this chemical communication cannot be differentiated between P. malvae and P. malvoides, a close relative considered a subspecies of P. malvae and not separated by isolation reproductive barriers.  Courting  There are two main mating strategies that are used by grizzled skippers, which ultimately illustrate mechanisms of sexual selection by this species. In both, males demonstrate territorial behaviours. In the case of perching, males wait on taller plants for females to come to them in order to begin courting. In the case of patrolling, males locate a desired female and fly down to her. The type of behaviour that they use in mating depends upon the pattern of food plant availability in their respective habitats. * Perching Approach: This is used in habitats that are poor for food plants. Males will engage in more of a perching approach where they await females above scrub edges that afford them with shelter, warmth, and visible range. * Patrolling Approach: This is used in habitats that are rich for food plants. Males will engage in more of a patrolling strategy by mingling with females.  Climate effects on distribution  Pyrgus malvae is particularly receptive to warmer and drier climates. Warmer summers are more favorable for the grizzled skipper and are positively correlated with the species. This could result from relationships between warmth and the success of the mother's ability to lay the egg as well as of larvae survival. Warmer climates also tend to hasten the development of larvae and allow for earlier onset of the pupal stage. Cooler northern weather may explain the concentration of this butterfly in southern regions. As a result of climate warming, the grizzled skipper appears to show decreases in northern range margin, distribution area, and abundance. This response appears to be dependent upon climatic as well as nonclimatic driving forces.  Physiology  = Wing structure effect on flight behaviour = The wings of Pygrus malvae are only mildly adhesive, rough, and highly hydrophobic. These qualities prevent their wings from sticking to external surfaces, support their resistance to water damage, and allow the butterfly to self-clean its wings without risking desiccation. Additionally, these properties enable the grizzled skipper to avoid excess weight bearing, consequently promoting secure and efficient flight patterns.  Conservation  = Concerns =  Past  1- Decreased woodland clearings, unimproved grassland, scrub habitats 2- Unimproved grasslands and scrub habitats that have been changed 3- Woodland and grassland sites that have been broken apart or deserted 4- Artificial habitats that have been deteriorated  Current/Future  1- Further changes that reduce open areas and spread apart clearings 2- Reductions in coppice produce 3- Further deteriorating unimproved grassland, scrub, and artificial habitats 4- Further breaking apart and deserting habitats = Prevalence decline = The grizzled skipper has notably been decreasing in its prevalence in several other European countries over the past 25 years. The species has experienced significant declines (ranging from 25% to over 50%) in Britain, Croatia, Belgium, European Turkey, and the Netherlands. Less severe decline can be seen in the Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, Romania, Sweden, Slovakia, and Asian Turkey. Once found across England as well as regions in Wales, the grizzled skipper is now concentrated in Central and Southern England only. In fact, five of England's counties have already experienced extinction of the species, and the butterfly can only be found in less than five sites in another five English counties. However, between 1995 and 1997, evidence of recolonization by the grizzled skipper has emerged, specifically in several counties in England. = Grazing effect on population = Grazing has been applied as an approach to conservation, especially in the Netherlands where it is used to monitor the biodiversity of open habitats. Pyrgus malvae is important in these studied because it is considered as a threatened to susceptible species in the Netherlands. Grazing appears to be positively associated with populations of Pyrgus malvae that are concentrated more in habitats with grazed vegetation rather than those with cut and ungrazed regions. The trend may be reflective of the fact that grizzled skippers prefer open grassland habitats. With its endangered status in the Netherlands, the grizzled skipper may benefit from extensive grazing as a nature restoration project. References =Literature= Brereton, T. M.; Bourn, N. A.

It is located in the northern fifth of the former Rotunda Gardens in Parnell Square, a Georgian square at the northern end of O'Connell Street. The garden was opened by Eamon de Valera during the semicentennial of the Easter Rising in 1966. Commemoration Children of Lir sculpture The Garden commemorates freedom fighters from various uprisings, including: * the 1798 rebellion of the Society of United Irishmen * the 1803 rebellion of Robert Emmet * the 1848 rebellion of Young Ireland * the 1867 rising of the Fenian Brotherhood * the 1916 Easter Rising of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army * the 1919‚Äì21 Irish War of Independence of the Irish Republican Army The site of the Garden is where the Irish Volunteers were founded in 1913, and where several leaders of the 1916 Rising were held overnight before being taken to Kilmainham Gaol. President √âamon de Valera opened the Garden in 1966 on the fiftieth anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, in which he had been a commander. Design Celtic custom, on concluding a battle, the weapons were broken and cast in the river, to signify the end of hostilities. The Garden was designed by D√°ith√≠ Hanly. It is in the form of a sunken cruciform water-feature. Its focal point is a statue of the Children of Lir by Ois√≠n Kelly, symbolising rebirth and resurrection, added in 1971. In 1976, a contest was held to find a poem which could express the appreciation and inspiration of this struggle for freedom. The winner was Dublin born author Liam Mac Uist√≠n, whose poem \\"We Saw a Vision\\", an aisling style poem, is written in Irish, French, and English on the stone wall of the monument. The aisling ( \\"vision\\") form was used in eighteenth-century poems longing for an end to Ireland's miserable condition. Saoirse (freedom in the Irish language) in the aisling in the Garden of Remembrance. In Irish the poem reads: In 2004, it was suggested that as part of the redesign of the square the Garden of Remembrance itself might be redesigned.

The majority of the range is within Cambodia. The silhouette of the Cardamom Mountains appears in the provincial seal of Trat Province in Thailand.Seals of The Provinces of Thailand Location and description The mountain range extends along a southeast-northwest axis from Chanthaburi Province in Thailand, and Koh Kong Province in Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand, to the Veal Veang District in Pursat Province, and extends to the southeast by the D√¢mrei (Elephant) Mountains.Cardamom and Elephant Mountains (Cambodia) It does snow in these mountain ranges The Thai part of the range comprise heavily eroded and dispersed mountain fragments of which the Khao Sa Bap, Khao Soi Dao and Chamao-Wong Mountains, east, north and west of Chanthaburi respectively, are the most prominent. Dense tropical rainforest prevails on the wet westward slopes which annually receive from of rainfall. By contrast, only 1,000 to 1,500 mm (40 to 60 inches) fall on the wooded eastern slopes in the rain shadow facing the interior Cambodian plain, such as the Kirirom National Park. Most of the mountains are a dense wilderness, with almost no human population or activity, but on the eastern slopes, cardamom and pepper are grown commercially, and several large-scale construction projects have begun since the turn of the century. =Summits= The highest elevation of the Cardamom Mountains is Phnom Aural in the northeast at . This is also Cambodia's highest peak. Phnom Samkos (1,717 m), Phnom Tumpor (1,516 m) and Phnom Kmoch (1,220 m) are other important summits in the Cambodian parts. In Thailand, the peaks of Khao Sa Bap (673 m), Khao Soi Dao Tai (1,675 m) and Khao Chamao [1,024 m) are the most prominent. History The mountains contain many historic sites from the 15th- to 17th-century, containing 60 cm exotic ceramic jars and rough-hewn log coffins set out on remote, natural rock ledges, scattered around the mountains. The jar burials are a unique feature of this region, and forms a previously unrecorded burial practice in Khmer cultural history. Local legends suggest the bones are the remains of Cambodian royalty. Tep Sokha, P. Bion Griffin and D. Kyle Latinis recording ancient rock art at Kanam in 2015. Over 220 separate images were identified - mostly elephants, deer, wild cow/buffalo, humans riding elephants, and unidentifiable mammals. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301898893_The_Kanam_Rock_Painting_Site_Cambodia_Current_Assessments Buddhist shrine. Chulasirachumbot Cetiya in Namtok Phlio National Park, Thailand. A unique rock art cave site known as Kanam depicts ancient elephants, elephant riders, deer and wild cow (or buffalo) in red ochre paint. The site is located in the eastern part of the Cardamoms near Kravanh Township (Pursat Province). The Cardamoms are home to one of the largest protected wild elephant populations in Southeast Asia. The human riders may represent elephant capture and training activities - a major cultural tradition among various ethnic groups in the area until the 1970s. Traditions, experts, and elephant populations were decimated by the Khmer Rouge Regime. The cave and paintings may have played important roles for rituals and magic used to placate ancestors and spirits; seek protection (elephant capture is very dangerous); bring good fortune; and transmit specialized knowledge (teaching/training). Some of the paintings may be various species of wild cow or buffalo. It is difficult to distinguish the possible cow from the possible deer representations due to the simple silhouette style. However, cowhides are extremely important for lassoes, ropes, snares and riggings related to elephant capture. Local elephant masters claimed there was more ritual and magic associated with these highly critical items than all others related to elephant capture. Thus, wild cow or buffalo representation might be expected. The large representation of deer may relate to the massive deerskin trade to Japan in the 15th - 17th centuries. Taiwan's deer populations had been almost annihilated due to insatiable demands for Samurai armor and Japanese accessories made of deerskin. Deerskin sourcing shifted to Cambodia and Thailand. As deer populations decreased, local hunters also may have resorted to more investment in magic and ritual to seek assistance from ancestors and spirits to increase luck. The paintings are thought to date from the late Angkorian period through the post-Angkor period (contemporaneous with the jar burials, perhaps created and used by the same ethnic groups). The site may date to as early as the Funan period (1st - 6th centuries) when the practice of capturing, training, and trading live elephants was first historically noted (a mission was sent to China in 357 AD with trained elephants as part of the tributary gifts to Emperor Mu of Jin). Whether or not elephant capture, training, and use for labor, prestige and warfare existed prior to the Funan period is unknown. It is possible that the practice, technology and knowledge was obtained through South Asian influence in the early first millennium AD. Left: animal scene panels enhanced with DStretch software. Note the random placement of mammals. Right: original and DStretch enhanced images of humans holding objects. Some have interpreted this to represent ritual scenes, perhaps dancing with musical instruments. These paintings help with understanding the ecological history. Local ethnic groups were able to maintain, sustain and promote elephant populations through a somewhat symbiotic relation until the 20th century. Deer and wild cow/buffalo, however, may have been hunted to near extinction by the 15th - 17th centuries. Eld's deer, muntjac, sambar, gaur, kouprey and banteng were probably far more prevalent in the past. = Indigenous people = Part of the mountains are home to indigenous people, including the Chhong in both Thailand and Cambodia,Beyond material benefits ‚Äì Connecting conservation and cultural identity in Cambodia and the ethnic Por (or Pear) in Pursat Province, Cambodia. They all belong to the group known as Pearic peoples. In Cambodia, indigenous people are collectively referred to as Khmer Loeu. = Khmer Rouge = This largely inaccessible mountain range formed one of the last strongholds of the Khmer Rouge, driven out by Vietnamese forces during the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War. The Thai border to the west acted as a conduit for Chinese support and, eventually, a sanctuary for fleeing Khmer fighters and refugees. = Modern development = The inaccessibility of the hills has also helped to preserve the primeval forest and ecosystems of the area relatively intact. In 2002, however, a transborder highway to Thailand was completed south of the Cardamoms, along the coast. The highway has fragmented habitats for large mammals such as elephants, big cats and monkeys. The highway has also opened up for agricultural slash-and-burn projects and opportunistic poaching for endangered animals, all degrading the natural value and the forests ecosystems. Tourism is relatively new to the Cardamom Mountains. In 2008, Wildlife Alliance launched a community-based ecotourism program in the village of Chi-Phat, marketed as the \\"gateway to the Cardamoms\\".Lonely Planet Chi Phat Tourist visitors to Chi-Phat continue to grow and the community is regarded as a model for community-based ecotourism, with approximately 3,000 annual visitors generating more than $US 150,000 for the local community.Reimer, J. K., & Walter, P. (2013). How do you know it when you see it? Community-based ecotourism in the Cardamom Mountains of southwestern Cambodia. Tourism Management, 34, 122-132. International conservation organizations working in the area includes Wildlife Alliance, Conservation International,Conservation International Cambodia Program and Fauna and Flora International.Fauna & Flora International Cardamoms Mountain Program In 2016, the southern slopes of the Cardamom Mountains were designated as a new national park; Southern Cardamom National Park. It appears, however, that rampant illegal poaching is continuing nonetheless. Ecology These relatively isolated mountains are part of the Cardamom Mountains rain forests ecoregion, an important ecoregion of mostly tropical moist broadleaf forest. Being one of the largest and still mostly unexplored forests in Southeast Asia, it is separated from other rainforests in the region by the large Khorat Plateau to the north. For these reasons, the ecoregion is home to several endemic species and is a refuge for species who has been decimated or are endangered elsewhere. The Vietnamese Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc island off the coast of Cambodia has similar vegetation and is included in the ecoregion. Most of the ecoregion is covered in evergreen rain forest, but with several different habitats. Above 700 metres, a special thick evergreen forest-type dominates, and on the southern slopes of the Elephant Mountains, dwarf conifer Dacrydium elatum forests grows. On the Kirirom plateau, Tenasserim pine forest is found. The northern part of Cardamom Mountains is home to the southernmost natural habitats of Betula (species Betula alnoides). Throughout, Hopea pierrei, an endangered canopy tree rare elsewhere, is relatively abundant in the Cardamom Mountains. Other angiosperm tree species are Anisoptera costata, Anisoptera glabra, Dipterocarpus costatus, Hopea odorata, Shorea hypochra, Caryota urens and Oncosperma tigillarium. Other conifers include Pinus kesiya, Dacrycarpus imbricatus, Podocarpus neriifolius, P. pilgeri and Nageia wallichiana.Forest Vegetation of Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia. A.N. Kuznetsov, S.P.

Asian elephants (Elephas maximus indicus) The endangered pileated gibbon has a refuge in these mountains The moist climate and undisturbed nature of the rocky mountainsides appears to have allowed a rich variety of wildlife to thrive, although the Cardamom and Elephant Mountains are poorly researched and the wildlife that is assumed to be here remains to be catalogued. They are thought to be home to over 100 mammals such as the large Indian civet and banteng cattle, and most importantly the mountains are thought to shelter at least 62 globally threatened animal species and 17 globally threatened trees, many of them endemic to Cambodia.BBC News, \\"New cryptic gecko species is discovered in Cambodia \\", 24 March 2010: accessed 24 March 2010. Among the animals are fourteen endangered and threatened mammal species, including the largest population of Asian elephant in Cambodia and possibly the whole of Indochina although this still needs to be proved. Other mammals, many of which are threatened, include Indochinese tiger, clouded leopard (Pardofelis nebulosa), dhole (a wild dog) (Cuon alpinus), gaur (Bos gaurus), banteng (Bos javanicus), the disputed kting voar (Pseudonovibos spiralis), Malayan sun bear, pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus), Sumatran serow (Capricornis sumatraensis), Sunda pangolin and the Tenasserim white-bellied rat.CeroPath - Niviventer tenaster Thomas, 1916 There are at least 34 species of amphibians, three of them described as new species to science from here. The rivers are home to both Irrawaddy and humpback dolphins and are home to some of the last populations on Earth of the very rare Siamese crocodiles and the only nearly extinct northern river terrapin, or royal turtle remaining in Cambodia. While the forests are habitat for more than 450 bird species, half of Cambodia's total of which four, the chestnut-headed partridge, Lewis's silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera lewisi), the green peafowl (Pavo muticus) and the Siamese partridge (Arborophila diversa) are endemic to these mountains. A reptile and amphibian survey led in June 2007 by Dr Lee Grismer of La Sierra University in Riverside, California, US and the conservation organisation Fauna and Flora International uncovered new species, such as a new Cnemaspis gecko, C. neangthyi.

The level of active protection has been criticised. The human population of the Cardamom Mountain Range, although very small, is extremely poor. Threats to the ecological stability and biological diversity of the region include illegal wildlife poaching, habitat destruction due to illegal logging, construction and infrastructure projects, plantation clearings, mining projects, and forest fires caused by slash-and-burn agriculture. While the Cambodian forests in the Cardamom Mountains are fairly intact, the section in Thailand has been badly affected. The mountains has many waterfalls Protections in the Cardamom Mountains comprise the following: ;Cambodia *Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary *Central Cardamom Mountains *Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary *Samlaut Multiple Use Area *Southern Cardamom National Park *Botum-Sakor National Park *Kirirom National Park *Preah Monivong National Park (aka Bokor National Park) ;Thailand *Namtok Khlong Kaeo National Park *Namtok Phlio National Park *Khao Khitchakut National Park *Khao Chamao-Khao Wong National Park *Khao Soi Dao Wildlife Sanctuary *Klong Kruewai Chalerm Prakiat Wildlife Sanctuary *Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary. = Threats = Aerial view of an illegal logging camp in the Cardamom Mountains, Koh Kong Province The flora, fauna and ecosystems of the Cardamom Mountains are threatened by large construction and infrastructure projects, mining, illegal logging, and opportunistic hunting and poaching. Despite the very high level of protectional status, the actual protection of the conservation areas and implementation of the law has been very poor. The violation of the protection laws has happened on all levels, from opportunistic locals, and local business entrepreneurs, to governmental institutions, foreign companies and international criminal organisations. In the late 2010s, international conservation organisations, and the UN, has collaborated with the Cambodian government to halt a number of planned construction projects and clearings in protected areas. In 2016, the Cambodian government established a collaboration with international conservation organisations to increase on-ground patrolling and actual park ranger services, building several ranger headquarters and hiring armed personnel with arresting rights. This might signify a change in the destructive trends, at least concerning governmental responsibilities.Cardamom National Park, Cambodia Tourism Religious site in Khao Khitchakut National Park, Thailand The Cardamom Mountains are an emerging tourist destination. The village of Chi Phat runs a Community-Based Eco-Tourism project with the support of conservation NGO, Wildlife Alliance. Previously a logging and hunting community, villagers now make sustainable income through homestays, multiple day guided treks to natural and cultural sites, mountain bike, boat and bird watching tours. The Wildlife Release Station in Koh Kong Province is a release site for animals rescued from the illegal wildlife trade in Cambodia by the NGO Wildlife Alliance. Binturong, porcupine, pangolins, civets, macaques and an array of birds are among the many species that have been released on site. The station was opened to tourists in December 2013, offering guests an insight into the workings of a wildlife rehabilitation and release site while staying in jungle chalets and enjoying Cambodian hospitality. Activities offered can include feeding resident wildlife, jungle hiking, radio tracking and setting camera traps to monitor released wildlife. Wild Animal Rescue (WAR Adventures Cambodia) also organize a wide range of deep jungle activities from the family trekking to the hardcore RAID adventure, jungle orientation and survival training course, even animals and human tracking course, all in the region of Sre Ambel in the South-west of the Cardamom mountains.

Apollo contracted for the construction of fifteen Saturn V launch vehicles used to launch the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon, and achieved the first crewed landing with the sixth one (Apollo 11), leaving nine for follow-on lunar missions, through Apollo 20. However, budget cuts caused NASA to cancel the last three missions, ending the lunar program after Apollo 17. One Saturn V was used to launch the Skylab space station, and parts of the other two became museum displays. An \\"Apollo 21\\" lunar landing mission appears in three twenty-first-century works of fiction. Possible origin The Apollo program used a Saturn V to launch the first crewed test of the complete Apollo spacecraft, consisting of the Apollo Command/Service Module and a separate Apollo Lunar Module landing craft in a low Earth orbit, on the Apollo 9 mission. However, the original plan for this test would have used two launches of the smaller Saturn IB Earth-orbital launch vehicle: the first would launch the crew in the Command/Service Module, followed shortly by a second, uncrewed launch of the Lunar Module, with which the crew would rendezvous in orbit. Some people have speculated that tentative plans of an \\"Apollo 21\\" might have been made assuming availability of the extra Saturn V that would have left, although by the time NASA resumed planning crewed missions using this numbering sequence (defined on April 24, 1967), the dual- Saturn IB plan had been replaced with the single Saturn V.

Definition of benefit fraud  The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) define benefit fraud as when someone obtains state benefit they are not entitled to or deliberately fails to report a change in their personal circumstances. The DWP claim that fraudulent benefit claims amounted to around ¬£900 million in 2008‚Äì09.Reporting benefit fraud at Directgov The most common form of benefit fraud is when a person receives unemployment benefits, while working. Another common form of fraud is when the receivers of benefits claim that they live alone, but they are financially supported by a partner or spouse. Failing to inform the state about a \\"change of circumstances\\", for example, that your partner is now living with you, or that you have moved house, or that a relative has died, leaving you some money may also be fraud by omission.What is benefit theft? at DWP In 2002, the DWP launched a 'Targeting Benefit Thieves' advertising campaign to spread their message that benefit fraud carried a criminal sanction. The most recent campaign makes claims about the likelihood of getting caught and the consequences of committing benefit fraud using ‚ÄòAnd they thought they‚Äôd never be caught‚Äô as the leading slogan. Latest figures For 2018-19 the government's benefit fraud figure was ¬£2.3bn (1.2%) for benefits administered by the Department of Work and Pensions.https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in- the-benefit-system-financial-year-2018-to-2019-estimates The tax credit system, administered by HMRC, has combined error and fraud figures (net over- payment) for 2015-16 of ¬£1.35 billion or 4.8% of finalised tax credit entitlement. HMRC claim that \\"the vast majority of organised fraud claims are stopped quickly and awards in payment are terminated.\\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/701053/Tax_Credits_EFAP_2015-16.pdf  Public opinion on benefit fraud  The State of the Nation report published in 2010 by the Government of David Cameron estimated the total benefit fraud in the United Kingdom in 2009/10 to be approximately ¬£1 billion. Figures quoted as distinct from costs related to error Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show that benefit fraud is thought to have cost taxpayers ¬£1.2 billion during 2012‚Äì13, up 9 per cent on the year before. A poll conducted by the Trades Union Congress in 2012 found that perceptions among the British public were that benefit fraud was high ‚Äì on average people thought that 27% of the British welfare budget is claimed fraudulently; however, official UK Government figures have stated that the proportion of fraud stands at 0.7% of the total welfare budget in 2011/12. Claims of disproportionality The political scientist Adam Taylor claimed that the targeting of benefit fraud was disproportionate and was evidence of \\"government using strong-arm tactics on the weakest members of British society\\": the disabled and the poor.Adam Taylor, A taxing problem, Comment is Free, 10 January 2007 Taylor argued that the amount of money lost to false benefit claims was small compared to the huge amount lost to tax fraud which he estimated as costing the UK economy ¬£150bn (this compares to the HMRC estimate of ¬£4.1bn), yet he believed that comparatively little and in most cases nothing at all was done to pursue corporate tax evaders who defraud the people of the UK. Taylor argued that the crucial difference between these two practices is that \\"the former is committed by the weakest and most vulnerable of society, while the far more damaging crime is being committed by the richest (and the most corrupt traitors) in the UK.\\" Fraud investigation Since the introduction of the Welfare Reform Act 2007, councils can independently investigate a number of Social Security benefits.  Assessment of benefit fraud assessed  A benefit fraudster is extremely unlikely to be investigated unless some third party reports them to, and provides evidence to, the police or the Job Centre (i.e. they slip up and admit it, or if they act in a particularly suspicious manner during a routine encounter with Job Centre staff, perhaps taking work telephone calls while at a signing-on appointment). That is to say that the two key reasons for investigating someone are: *Because they are reported by someone who has evidence they are committing fraud. *Because they accidentally give away to the Job Centre evidence of their own fraud. When investigating cases, Fraud Officers will collect facts and a decision will be made on whether or not to take further action. They may gather information about the claimant and their family members, then compare it with information already given on claim forms or in interviews.What happens if you are suspected of benefit fraud at Directgov Officers can contact private and public organisations that hold information on a suspected benefit thief including banks, building societies, utility providers. If evidence is found that benefit fraud has been committed, any of the following may happen: * prosecution * pay a penalty as an alternative to prosecution * the benefit may be reduced or withdrawn * overpaid benefit will have to be paid back * confiscation of homes and possessions  Benefit fraud abroad  Some UK benefits can not be claimed when people go abroad. Between April 2008 and March 2009 it is estimated that ¬£55 million was lost as a result of benefit fraud overpayments to British claimants who did not tell the authorities they were living or travelling abroad.  Penalties  When someone is caught for benefit fraud there are three key 'sanctions' that DWP or the Council can apply. These are formal cautions, administrative penalties and prosecution. By section 121 section 121 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 from 8 May 2012 cautions will no longer be offered by DWP. The main criterion for the offering of a caution is that the person has to have admitted that they have committed an offence. Other than this criterion, there is no statutory framework regulating which sanction is used in disposal of a case. This is a matter of policy for the relevant authority. The Department for Work and Pensions has a national policy; each Local Authority will have its own Policy which will set different criteria and financial guidelines. The Administrative Penalty is effectively a fine and is set at 30% or 50% of the total amount overpaid to them (the percentage applied is dependent upon when the overpayment period commenced - overpayments occurring wholly on or after 08.05.2012 incur a 50% fine). This figure is set in section 115A(3) s115A Security Administration Act 1992 Security Administration Act 1992 there is no negotiation on this. In addition to this, benefit thieves also need to pay back all of the money they deliberately defrauded. The suspect does not have to admit their guilt to be offered an Administrative Penalty, however it should only be offered by the Department for Work and Pensions, or the Local Authority if they believe there is sufficient evidence for court proceedings to be considered if the offer is refused. Prosecution may typically occur in England & Wales using the Social Security Administration Act 1992, or under the Theft Act 1978, or the Fraud Act 2006; in Northern Ireland under corresponding legislation; or in Scotland under Common Law Fraud. A Prosecution is brought when the value of the overpaid benefit is so great, or the period of the fraud is lengthy, or the person may have been in a position of trust, or the fraud was very blatant. Any prosecution brought by the Department for Work and Pensions or a Local Authority should have been subject to the Public Interest Test as set out in the Code of Practice for Crown Prosecutors. In Scotland cases of benefit fraud are reported to the Procurator Fiscal for prosecution.  Prosecution ‚Äì legal points  Where cases of benefit fraud result in criminal prosecution, in England & Wales such prosecutions are generally brought either under section 112 Social Security Administration Act 1992 (where no dishonesty is alleged) or under s111A of the same Act (where dishonesty is alleged). There are a number of legal cases relevant to prosecutions under these sections. Key points are dealt with in more detail in technical articles on benefit fraud.David Winch, \\"Benefit fraud\\" (2009) The penalties for benefit fraud may be mitigated where it can be shown that the defendant would have been entitled to other forms of financial benefit, such as UK Tax Credits, had an appropriate claim on the true facts been lodged at the time. A person convicted of benefit fraud may be held to have a 'criminal lifestyle' in confiscation proceedings under Parts 2, 3 & 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

History Bonspille is a traditionalist, elected to the chiefs' council in 2001. The community had adopted a new system of electoral politics in 1991, following the Oka Crisis. Formerly chiefs were selected by clan mothers as part of a traditional, hereditary system based in matrilineal kinship. Children are considered born into their mother's clans in the community, and derive their status from the mother. In the early 2000s, Bonspille became a key figure in a power struggle in the government of Kanesatake. He and two other traditionalist chiefs at the time, Pearl Bonspille and John Harding (Sha ko hen the tha), opposed then-Grand Chief James Gabriel (1996-2004), who had been elected three times. These three men generally considered Gabriel a modernist. Journalist Benoit Aubin has observed that there are strains of ethnic tension among people in the community. Harding and Gabriel both have mixed ancestry, but Harding's mother is Mohawk, so he belongs to her clan under the matrilineal system. Gabriel has a Mohawk father and is a registered member of the community, but his mother is not Mohawk.Aubin, Benoit (March 23, 2004). \\"Kanesatake Chief in Exile\\", Maclean's Magazine, online at The Canadian Encyclopedia, Retrieved on: 16 October 2015. Among the issues, the traditionalists were concerned about Gabriel's trying to reduce sales of contraband cigarettes. Most importantly, they opposed his having hired private police forces (with funding from Ottawa) for a drug raid to be conducted in the community in January 2004. More than 200 protesters confined these officers to the police station, and that night there was violence and arson in the community. Numerous people were prosecuted. Grand Chief Gabriel left the community for his safety after his house and car were burned.Jeff Heinrich, \\"Wide-open race in Kanesatake\\", The Gazette, 27 Jun 2008, La Nation Autochthone du Quebec, accessed 29 Jan 2010 During an interim period, traditionalists created a police force in the community; an official interim police director provided support to those Mohawk living in Oka, Quebec, which surrounds Kanesatake.Irwin Block, \\"Oka standoff, Quebec; Kanesatake divided over police chief's legitimacy; Thompson's opponents say they have no intention of recognizing his position\\", The Gazette, 12 April 2004, accessed 14 October 2015 In 2005 Bonspille defeated Gabriel in the popular election for grand chief. A slate of six persons were elected to the chiefs' council (band council), replacing both Harding and Pearl Bonspille. All were supporters of James Gabriel.

Following his subsequent trial and conviction for the 1942 murder of Garda Detective Sergeant Denis O'Brien, Kerins was hanged at Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. Early life Kerins was born in Caherina, Tralee, County Kerry, Ireland and attended Balloonagh Mercy Convent School and then the CBS, Edward Street. At the age of 13, he won a Kerry County Council scholarship and completed his secondary education at the Green Christian Brothers and the Jeffers Institute. In 1930, Kerins passed the Intermediate Certificate with honours and the matriculation examination to the NUI. He later did a commercial course and took up employment in a radio business in Tralee. Kerins was also active in the Gaelic Athletic Association and in 1939 won a county medal in football with his local team, O'Rahilly's, now renamed Kerins O'Rahilly's in his honour. IRA career In 1940, Kerins was sworn into the IRA, and was appointed to the GHQ staff in May 1942. At the time, the Fianna F√°il Government of Eamonn De Valera was determined to preserve Irish neutrality during World War II. Therefore, the IRA's bombing campaign in England, its attacks against targets in Northern Ireland, and its ties to the intelligence services of Nazi Germany were regarded as severe threats to Ireland's national security. According to historian Tim Pat Coogan, \\"An iron gloved approach to the I.R.A. was the order of the day with vigorous raids and interrogations. As a result, relations between individual I.R.A. men and the [Irish] Special Branch became understandably strained, and the I.R.A., in its shattered and disorganized condition, came to regard the Special Branch as a greater enemy than the British Crown.\\"The IRA: A History, page 144. IRA men who were captured by the Garda√≠ were interned for the duration of the war by the Irish Army in the Curragh Camp, County Kildare. Assassination of Detective Sergeant O'Brien On the morning of 9 September 1942, Garda Detective Sergeant Denis O'Brien was leaving his home in Ballyboden, Dublin. He was between his front gate and his car when he was cut down with Thompson submachine guns.Tim Pat Coogan, \\"The IRA: A History,\\" pages 143-144. D.S. O'Brien, an Anti-Treaty veteran of the Irish Civil War, had enlisted in the Garda S√≠och√°na in 1933. He was one of the most effective Detectives of the Special Branch Division, which had its headquarters at Dublin Castle. According to historian Tim Pat Coogan, \\"The shooting greatly increased public feeling against the I.R.A., particularly as the murder was carried out in full view of his wife. As she held her dying husband, she watched his assailants cycling past.\\"The IRA: A History, page 144. Arrest Following the arrest of Hugh McAteer in October 1942, Kerins was named Chief of Staff of the IRA. Despite a massive manhunt by Garda√≠, Kerins remained at large for two years. Travel author Dervla Murphy recounts in her book on Northern Ireland, A Place Apart that Kerins stayed at her family's County Waterford home for two weeks while he was on the run, having given his name as Pat Carney.Murphy, Devla (1978). A Place Apart. UK: Penguin Books, Ltd. pp.27-34 He had been sent to the Murphy's by Dervla's aunt, Dr. Kathleen Farrell, who was a staunch IRA supporter,Murphy, p.27 and Dervla (aged 12 at the time) and Kerins struck up a friendship.Murphy, pp.30-31 Several months after Kerins left the Murphy's, he was captured. Kerins had previously left papers and guns hidden at Kathleen Farrell's house in the Dublin suburb of Rathmines. He telephoned the house, as he intended to retrieve them. However, Dr. Farrell's telephone had been tapped by the Garda√≠. On 15 June 1944, Kerins was arrested in an early morning raid. He was sleeping when the Garda√≠ entered his bedroom and did not have an opportunity to reach the Thompson submachine gun which was hidden under his bed. Trial At a trial before the Special Criminal Court in Collins Barracks, Dublin, Kerins was formally charged on 2 October 1944 for the \\"shooting at Rathfarnham of Detective Dinny O‚ÄôBrien\\". According to Coogan, \\"At the end of his trial, the president of the Military Court delayed sentence until later in the day to allow Kerins, if he wished, to make an application whereby he might have avoided the capital sentence. When the court resumed, Kerins said: 'You could have adjourned it for six years as far as I am concerned, as my attitude towards this Court will always be the same.' He thus deprived himself of the right to give evidence, to face cross examination, or to call witnesses.\\"Tim Pat Coogan, \\"The IRA: A History,\\" page 144.

Transnistria adopted this design that comprises a version of the 1952‚Äì1990 flag of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in the 2000 Law about State Symbols.  History  The flag of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic served as the republic's flag until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. When Moldova became independent, some places in Transnistria refused to fly the new Moldovan flag and continued to fly the flag of the Soviet Union. Continued use of the flag of the former Moldavian SSR was popular and it was officially reintroduced as the flag of Transnistria in 2000. Confusingly, despite the flag and coat of arms, Transnistria is not a socialist state. It is the only state in Europe that uses the hammer and sickle on its flag (although the flags of Bryansk Oblast, Vladimir Oblast and Oryol city in Russia also have the hammer and sickle).  Usage  For government usage, only the state flag is valid. Transnistrian law permits the use of a simplified version of the flag for non-governmental use (personal and commercial usage) without the hammer and sickle and red star and without regard to shape or size. The most common size is still 1:2, but 2:3 versions have also been used. number plate with the simplified flag in the corner.  White-blue-red tricolor  In 2009 the Parliament of Transnistria discussed a proposal to replace the civil flag (plain red-green-red) with a new flag, carrying three horizontal stripes in the colours white, blue and red, being almost identical to the flag of the Russian Federation, but with different aspect ratio (1:2 instead of Russia's 2:3).

In a 2006 referendum, 97.2% of Transnistrians voted in favour of increased association with Russia. The new flag would be used alongside the current state flag. On 12 April 2017, the Transnistrian Supreme Council passed a motion making the new flag Transnistria's second official flag.  Other flags  The presidential flag is a 1:1, yellow fringed version of the civil flag with the coat-of-arms in the centre.

The army flag is a blue flag with a yellow bordered red cross.Gaceta de Banderas It is similar to that of the Moldovan army, but does not include the Moldovan coat-of-arms.

Evans removed Spacey as the director, DiCaprio joined the production, and in December 1998 DiCaprio chose Michael Mann as the director. Mann subsequently hired Tony- and Oscar-nominated screenwriter John Logan in the spring of 1999 to write yet another screenplay.Shprintz, Janet. \\"Evan Sues Over Hughes Pic.\\" Variety.

Evans began sharing with Mann and Logan his large archive of Hughes memorabilia and biographical materials (which Evans says he had been building since 1995). In March 2000, Evans says, he learned that Mann had taken the project to New Line Cinema. Evans sued for breach of implied contract, fraud, and intentional interference with economic advantage. Mann strongly denied the accusations, arguing that his Howard Hughes biopic had nothing to do with the one he and Evans had worked on. A confidential out-of-court settlement was reached in 2001, and Evans was granted producer credit on Mann's New Line Cinema picture.

It is situated at the western border of Frankfurt am Main in the Taunus hills. Fischbach is a middle-class town and has about 5,900 inhabitants. Geography =Location= Hills surrounding Fischbach The town lies in the valley of a stream with the same name in the Taunus hills. It is north-west of central Kelheim and adjoins Hornau to the east. The town of Eppstein is to the west and K√∂nigstein im Taunus is northeast of Fischbach. The source of the Fischbach stream is in Ruppertshain. It flows through Fischbach and the Fischbachtal (Fishbachl valley) to merge with the Schwarzbach stream in Eppstein. Hill peaks around Fischbach are the Fischbacher Kopf, Staufen and Rossert. Fischbach is a dormitory town for many working in Frankfurt am Main. =Traffic= Bundesstra√üe 455 (federal highway 455) heads from K√∂nigstein via Fischbach to Eppstein and Wiesbaden. The former through road was substituted by a bypass in the early 1980s. The new road does not bypass Fischbach but crosses the town on an artificial embankment, with a bridge over the central street Langstra√üe. Bus routes connect Fischbach with Kelkheim railway station and the Frankfurt Transit system. =Structure of the town= The old town centre is situated at the intersection of the main roads from Kelkheim to the suburb of Ruppertshain and from K√∂nigstein to Eppstein. The first road, Langstra√üe, is the main road of the old part of the village. In the 19th century Fischbach grew along both streets, especially Kelkheimer Stra√üe and Eppsteiner Stra√üe. Fischbach's population swelled after World War II with refugees from areas that were ceded to other countries, leading to street names such as Egerl√§nder Stra√üe and K√∂nigsberger Stra√üe. Residential areas were built on both sides of Kelkheimer Stra√üe and on the south-side of the town, around Staufenstra√üe and Sodener Stra√üe. In the north, only a small residential estate was built on a former brickyard area (An der Ziegelei). In the 1970s summer cottages were built on the road to K√∂nigstein, and are now year-round residences. History =Administrative history= Fischbach was founded by Franks. The first document which proves the existence of Fischbach (gift to Fulda convent), is dated in the year 780. In the 8th and 9th centuries, imperial laws appear. In 813, the village was in possession of Earl Liutfried as royal feud. Starting from 890 Fischbach was part of the shire of Uualahes and during early and high middle ages a member of the Niddagau province.http://www.lagis-hessen.de/de/subjects/idrec/sn/ol/id/11255 In 1348 the Lords of Eppstein became the new rulers. In 1581 Fischbach became part of Archbishopric of Mainz and was governed from K√∂nigstein. After Napoleon split the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Fischbach and the vicinity was part of Duchy of Nassau. Nassau was annexed by Prussia in 1866 degraded to Wiesbaden district of the Prussian province Hessen-Nassau. Fischbach attended to this administration till the foundation of Hesse in 1946. After being integrated to Prussia, Fischbach belonged to the Upper-Taunus district. Since 1928 it was part of the newly founded Main-Taunus district. In 1977 Fischbach was incorporated to the city of Kelkheim, together with the former community Rossert (Ruppertshain and Eppenhain). =Coat of arms= 80px The emblem shows the \\"chevrons of Eppstein\\" on the right as symbol of the former affiliation to the neighbour town. When Fischbach was part of Archbishopric of Mainz, the chevrons had been substituted by the \\"wheel of Mainz\\" (Mainzer Rad). It has been removed after Fischbach became part of Hessen-Nassau. The left field shows, according to the town name, two red fishes in a silver creek. =Economical and social history= Fischbach, 1893 The economy of the village was based on agriculture and fruit-growing for centuries. Typically for the lower Taunus are fruit grasslands with apple trees. Since the beginning of the 19th century, many carpenters and joineries were located in the town. Different from Kelkheim, the furniture industry could not be conserved to the present. Besides, the clayey ground allowed setting up brickyards. Also the industry, especially Farbwerke in H√∂chst (Hoechst AG, today Industriepark H√∂chst), is a source of income since the late 19th century. The opening of railway line from K√∂nigstein to H√∂chst in 1901 improved the connections to H√∂chst and Frankfurt. Before that, many workers had to walk every morning to Soden railway station (approx. ). After World War II, Fischbach had about 1,000 inhabitants. Due to refugee settlement, mainly from Sudetenland, the number of residents was doubled. The village became even bigger in the 1960s and 1970s due to suburbanization. Fischbach changed from a small Taunus- village to a suburb of Frankfurt. The number of residents rose to about 6,000 in the early 1980s and has changed little since then. Due to strong immigration of citizens from Frankfurt, the confessional (mainly Catholic in former times) and the social structure changed: In addition to the long- established village residents, mostly craftsmen and farmers, an academic affected middle-class appeared (employees of Hoechst AG) Points of interest =Church Saint Trinity= In 1781, church Saint Trinity substituted an older church which was built in 1686. The building contains some extravaganza of this time and provides an impressive view from the lower meadows nearby. The church contains the so-called ‚ÄúRoteltisstein‚Äù, a Christian tombstone from the 7th century. It was transferred to Fischbach in 1868 from a demolished pilgrim chapel nearby (Gimbach). The stone proves the early Christianisation in this region. =Church Saint John= Like everywhere in the former area of Archbishopric of Mainz, inhabitants of Fischbach were traditionally catholic. The result of the large number of Protestants immigrated after World War II, was a growing demand for a Protestant church. A community was founded in the 1960s and is named after John the Baptist. The church has a modern style and has big, coloured windows. =Rettershof= Hofgut Retters. Rettershof, northeast of Fischbach, was founded in 1186 as a premonstratensian convent. During the protestant reformation, the landlord closed the convent in 1559 and converted it to a farm. The church of the convent was destroyed during the Thirty Years war. In 1884 an Englishman bought the manor and built a new mansion in Tudor style. His successors built a restaurant in 1938, which offered products from the farm. The city of Kelkheim bought Rettershof in 1980 and renovated it. Today, Rettershof consists of three parts: the historically styled yard of the manor, the former mansion and the restaurant. For some years in the 1908s the manor was the European headquarters of International Society for Krishna Consciousness. It is now a luxury hotel. =Gimbacher Hof= Though Hofgut Gimbach can only reached by car via Kelkheim, it belongs to Fischbach. The way from Fischbach to Gimbacher Hof is only for pedestrians and bikes. The way leads through land under environmental conservation. Until 1868, Gimbach was the location of a pilgrim chapel. After its demolition the altar was transferred to Saint Trinity in Fischbach, but the Gimbach pilgrimage continues to this day. Gimbacher Hof's name comes from the Gimbach, a stream that starts nearby when three tributaries join. The earliest known document of its existence dates to 1287, recorded as the \\"Gynnenbach\\". The manor grounds are used for horse breeding, for growing and pressing Apfelwein, the local cider, and as for camping. =Hanseklingerbrunnen= The bronze fountain in the village center was created in 1987 by Johannes Norbert Klarmann. It depicts a craftsman drinking water from the fountain. Public facilities Former town hall, today community center. =B√ºrgerhaus= The town hall of Fischbach was established shortly before the village was incorporated to Kelkheim. Today the building is community center, contains outposts of Kelkheim town authorities and is home for several clubs. The functional architecture is typical for buildings of the 1970s. Fire brigade facilities are also located at the town hall square. =Albert-von-Reinach school= Albert-von Reinach-school is an elementary school. It is located above the town hall square and consists of two buildings. The catchments area is equivalent to Fischbach area. The school is named after Albert von Reinach (* November 7, 1842 in Frankfurt am Main; ‚Ä† January 12, 1905). He was a banker from Frankfurt, who built a villa nearby the village. Albert von Reinach supported the school with noble donations. The older building was erected in 1952/54, the newer one in 1967. The complex replaced the old school building near St. Trinity church, which was placed there at least since 1822 and demolished in 1967. The first school in Fischbach was documented in 1604. =Staufen school / Eichendorff school / Gesamtschule Fischbach= The Staufenschule was a school for children from Fischbach, Hornau, Ruppertshain and Eppenhain. It was absorbed into the Eichendorff school on 31 July 2006. Due to rising student numbers the Eichendorff school's homonymus sister located in Kelkheim-Mitte has separated from Fischbach's school. It has been renamed to Gesamtschule Fischbach (General school of Fischbach, GSF) and put under its own administration in 2018. =Staufenhalle= After a long planning period, a new sports hall opened in 2002. The ‚ÄúStaufenhalle‚Äù replaced an old version from 1971. The hall is the largest roofed room in Kelkheim. It has a small stand and is used by schools and sports clubs. =Sports field= Open air sports events take place on Fischbach sports field. It is beside woods in the west end of the village. It is mainly used for football matches of the local football club SV Fischbach and was opened on 31 May 1930. In 1952 the area was modified. The ground was rotated by 90 degrees and changing rooms were built. The sports field reopened on 2 August 1953. In 1982 the facilities were renovated and a house for club activities was built. The sports field was equipped with an artificial turf during summer 2008. Events Fischbach celebrates carnival every year in February or March, with a Carnival Monday parade attracting approximately 25,000 visitors. Kermesse (Kerb) is celebrated each autumn on town hall square. during this time. The Protestant church community celebrates Saint John‚Äôs day (June 24). The Hanseklinger festival in late summer is celebrated in the village center around the homonymous fountain.

She was the only Colombian woman to win the Miss Universe pageant until Paulina Vega became Miss Universe 2014. Biography Zuluaga was born in Pereira. She moved to Manizales, (Department of Caldas) as a small child and grew up there. She applied for the Miss Caldas contest, and she won in 1957. Zuluaga went on with her training towards the Miss Colombia contest and arrived in Cartagena, hoping to win the Miss Colombia title. Pereira is part of the Caldas department. Risaralda was made a department in 1966 some years after her election. She represented the following local titles Miss Pereira, Miss Caldas, Miss Colombia Virreina (1st Runner up), Miss Colombia ‚Äî Winner and then Miss Universe. Miss Colombia 1957 Zuluaga did not win the contest, instead finishing as 1st Runner-Up. Before the Miss Universe pageant however, Miss Colombia 1957, Doris Gil Santamaria got married. Due to Miss Universe rules stating that no candidate can be married before the final contest itself, Santamaria was forced to resign, making Zuluaga Miss Colombia by default. Miss Universe The contest took place in Long Beach, California, on July 25, 1958. After Zuluaga was announced as the new Miss Universe, the only television station and most radio stations in Colombia at the time (as much as seventy-three) stopped their regular programming to report the breaking news. The evening gown she wore in the pageant was designed and made for her by Colombian designer Aura Leonor Troya de S√°nchez, who was a designer to the stars including at least three Miss Colombias. Zuluaga was not immediately able to return to her country, as Miss Universe personnel feared for her security because at the time Colombia was going through a period of extreme political volatility. When she eventually returned home, she was welcomed by large crowds both at El Dorado International Airport in Bogot√° and at Manizales airport. By now, the citizens of Manizales had accepted her as if she had been a native of the area. Learning that her family was not well off economically, many citizens collected money, which was used to build a better house for Zuluaga and her family. Life After Titleholding After years outside the spotlight, Zuluaga made headlines again when she married a medical doctor and moved to the United States. In 1966, she returned to Manizales and became involved with the city council as well as with the state's institute of tourism, of which she eventually became director. Zuluaga had three sons and a daughter. She died on December 2, 2015 at the age of 77 at her home in Manizales.

Pescanova invested about 350 million Euros in the Portuguese aquaculture plant, which was backed by the Portuguese government with about 45 million Euros in incentives. The plants incorporate wind farms to alleviate the high energy costs, as well as a fish feeding plant. The plants were projected to reach a production rate of between 30,000 and 100,000 tonnes per year.

This organism oxidizes ammonia into nitrite as a metabolic process, known as nitritation (a step of nitrification). Nitrosomonas are useful in a polluted water and waste treatment technique known as bioremediation. They are important in the nitrogen cycle as they increase the bioavailability of nitrogen to plants whilst limiting carbon fixation. The genus is found in soil, freshwater, and on building surfaces, especially in areas that contains high levels of nitrogen compounds. Nitrosomonas thrive in a pH range of 6.0‚Äì9.0, and a temperature range of . Most species are motile with a flagellum located in the polar region of the bacillus. The organism has power-generating membranes, which form long, thin tubes inside the cell. These use electrons from the oxidation of ammonia to produce energy. It obtains the carbon it requires from the atmosphere via carbon fixation, which converts gaseous carbon dioxide into carbon bound in organic molecules. Unlike plants, which fix carbon into sugars through energy gained through the process of photosynthesis, Nitrosomonas use energy gained through the oxidation of ammonia to fix gaseous carbon dioxide into organic molecules. Nitrosomonas must consume large amounts of ammonia before cell division can occur, and the process of cell division may take up to several days. This microbe is photophobic, and will generate a biofilm matrix, or form clumps with other microbes, to avoid light. The species Nitrosomonas europaea has been identified as being able to degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene, benzene, and vinyl chloride. Some Nitrosomonas species possess the enzyme urease, which catalyzes the conversion of the urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. N. europaea, as well as populations of soil-dwelling ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), have been shown to assimilate the carbon dioxide released by the reaction to make biomass via the Calvin cycle, and harvest energy by oxidizing ammonia (the other product of urease) to nitrite. This feature may explain enhanced growth of AOB in the presence of urea in acidic environments.Marsh, K. L., G. K. Sims, and R. L. Mulvaney. 2005.

The style acquired a name around 1990, when it became evident to composers working in New York City that a number of them, including John Luther Adams, Glenn Branca, Rhys Chatham, Kyle Gann, Michael Gordon, Arthur Jarvinen, Bernadette Speach, Ben Neill, Larry Polansky, Mikel Rouse, Evan Ziporyn, were employing similar types of global tempo structures in their music.Kyle Gann, Music Downtown, pp. 13-14; Kyle Gann, \\"Minimal Music, Maximal Impact: Minimalism Gets Complex: Totalism ; Kyle Gann, \\"Tyrannize Me,\\" VIllage Voice, Vol. XXXIX No. 13 (March 29, 1994), p. 86).

The term totalist refers to the aims of the music, in trying to have enough surface rhythmic energy, but also to contain enough background complexity. There is also an echo in the term of serialism's \\"total organization,\\" here drawn not from the 12-tone row, but from Henry Cowell's theories about using the same structuring devices for rhythm that have been traditionally used for pitch. For instance, the traditional ratio between frequencies of a major second interval is 9:8, and 9-against-8 is an important tempo contrast in many totalist pieces, achieved by having some instruments play dotted eighth-notes while others play triplet half-notes.Kyle Gann, \\"Totally Ismic,\\" Village Voice, Vol. XXXVIII No. 29 (July 20, 1993), p. 69, reprinted in Kyle Gann, Music Downtown, pp. 127‚Äì29.

The group has more than 2,500 outlets in the UK, concessions in UK department stores such as Debenhams, Selfridges, as well as several hundred franchises in other countries. The company is majority owned by Taveta Investments, itself owned by Tina Green, the wife of Sir Philip Green, who is himself the chairman of the Arcadia Group.

In April 2019, it was reported that the Arcadia group, controlled by Philip Green's family, had recorded a ¬£300m deficit into its pension fund, while the Green family had cashed out ¬£1.2bn in dividends from Arcadia in 2005. British MP Frank Field, who previously investigated the BHS pension deficit, has publicly criticised Philip Green for paying huge dividends to his family and friend Richard Caring \\"when things are going well\\", and making his employees pay \\"when things are not going well\\". History =Early history and pre-WW2 era= The Arcadia Group has its origins in the firm founded by 18-year-old Lithuanian immigrant Montague Burton in Chesterfield in 1903 as The Cross- Tailoring Company. Burton's initial operation, a men's clothing manufacture, tailoring and retailing operation, became the genesis for the current Burton Menswear chain, which still remains part of the company, albeit having moved away from traditional tailoring to mainstream men's off-peg casuals and formalwear line with shifting trends in fashion and clothing. The eventual holding company survived as Burton Group plc until 1998, when the current name was substituted. The firm's headquarters moved from Chesterfield to Leeds in 1910, and The Cross-Tailoring Company had changed its name to Burton by the time the First World War broke out in 1914.Burton shops history The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1929, by which time it had 400 stores, factories and mills. By then, the company had a large factory in Leeds. =Post-war developments and expansion= After World War II, Montague Burton offered men the chance to buy a full suit, which included jacket, trousers, waistcoat, shirt and underwear, which became known as The Full Monty. In 1946, the Company acquired the Peter Robinson women's fashion chain.Arcadia History By 1952, the year Montague Burton died, the Company was the largest multiple tailor in the world. Burton was the official suit supplier of the England national football team for the World Cup in 1966. In 1964, the Peter Robinson chain began what became a relaunch as Topshop. This was in response to the development of a new young fashion culture around Britain in the 1960s; Topshop became the company's home of young, modern, on- trend ladieswear, a role it continues to hold. The Topshop launch began with Topshop-branded departments within Peter Robinson stores in 1964, with the first standalone Topshop stores opened ten years later in 1974. Eventually, the Peter Robinson name was dropped altogether. In 1971 the Group acquired Evans, a major operator in the field of fashionable clothing for women wearing larger-sized clothes. In the 70s, and as a complement to the suit business, the Group began to develop itself significantly in mainstream clothing retailing by beginning to target chains to precisely defined markets - for example it launched Topman for young men in 1970. This development capitalised on the success of Topshop in catering for a young, fashion-savvy audience, and reflected the growth in men's casual clothing, with formal-wear sales declining due to the trend for more casual general clothing. The firm also expanded its horizons by acquiring businesses outside its fashion heartland, at one point owning Ryman, the stationery chain, but later scaled back to focus principally on clothing. The Dorothy Perkins chain was acquired in 1979, enabling the Group to expand into the mainstream womenswear market, following the success of its previous ladieswear ventures (Topshop and Evans). The Dorothy Perkins chain has subsequently been positioned as the group's main ladieswear operation, focused towards a similar target audience as Burton is in menswear. In 1984, the Group launched a new chain, Principles, for fashion conscious women with a higher disposable income; this allowed the firm to capitalise on emerging new fashion and business trends of the 1980s, such as power dressing. Principles for Men was launched a year later, in 1985, following the success of the ladies' division. Also in 1985, the Group acquired Debenhams, then the largest department store group in the UK. The large store Browns of Chester, which had previously been part of the Burton group, was subsequently moved across to trade as part of the Debenhams chain, and remained part of the Debenhams unit following the unit's divestment (it is today the only Debenhams-owned store not branded under the Debenhams name). The firm also purchased menswear firm Colliers, ultimately rolling this into the Burton, Topman and Principles For Men chains. =1990s: reorganisation, launches and acquisitions= In 1993, spurred on by the recession of the early 1990s which had led to declining sales across the clothing retail market, the Burton Group undertook a major review of its trading space portfolio. Under the banner of Townprint, the firm reviewed the location and branding of its stores in each town and city in which they operated. At the time of the review, the Group was operating in the region of 1,600 stores, some of which had been with the group for some years and some of which were no longer performing adequately. The ultimate result was that the Group ended the leases on around 380 of the outlets they were trading from at that point, though replaced over half of these (around 220 stores in all) with the lease of store units which the Group had not previously been trading from. Around 350 stores were transferred from one of the company's brands to another. As part of the Townprint programme, the firm began to roll out new ways of working, such as operating increasing numbers of combined stores, where several brands shared the same unit; these combinations (such as Topshop/Topman or Burton/Dorothy Perkins unit-shares) would continue to be developed through the 1990s and 2000s as a way of reducing overheads whilst maintaining geographical spread of the brands. In 1996, the Group made its first move into home shopping with the acquisition of Innovations, a mail order catalogue company, along with the Hawkshead brand in July 1996 and Racing Green in October 1996. Innovations and some related brands were then sold to the home shopping group Great Universal Stores in November 1997. The decision to de-merge Debenhams and separate it from the rest of the Group was announced in July 1997: the plan was approved by shareholders in January 1998 and the de-merger took effect later that month. At that time, Debenhams became a separate company with its own listing on the London Stock Exchange. It was at this point that the Group, until then still known as Burton Group plc, became Arcadia Group plc. The late 1990s also saw the launch of a new experimental high-fashion menswear chain, SU214 (Style Union 214), which took its name from its flagship store at 214 Oxford Street in London. The chain aimed to capitalise on the growing demand for high-end casualwear and expand upon the group's presence in the young menswear market. In June 1998, the Group acquired Wade-Smith, the Liverpool-based retailer of designer childrenswear, menswear and womenswear. The acquisition was primarily to allow Arcadia to expand its presence in the childrenswear market, which they had made little attempt at up to this point. New Wade Smith Jr stores opened in locations such as the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. In June 1999, the Arcadia Group launched Zoom, an e-commerce and Internet Service Provider that forms a key part of the Group's multi-channel approach to retailing. Shortly after Zoom's launch, Associated Newspapers Ltd acquired a 50% stake in Zoom, allowing both partners to benefit from the increased joint marketing opportunities. In July 1999, Arcadia Group increased its share of the UK womenswear market with the acquisition of the Sears womenswear businesses, comprising the Warehouse, Wallis, Richards, Miss Selfridge and Outfit brands from the defunct Sears plc. Shortly afterwards, Arcadia chose to close down the underperforming Richards chain, though shops in suitable locations were rebranded under other Arcadia store brands. Arcadia continued to develop the Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Warehouse brands, and expanded significantly the Outfit out-of-town store chain, introducing other Arcadia brands to the stores and expanding the store network. =2000 to present= In 2000, the firm undertook a strategy known internally as BrandMAX under which underperforming brands were closed or scaled down. In some cases stores which were closed were replaced by other Arcadia properties. As part of BrandMAX, the Wade Smith Jr, Principles For Men and SU214Report on SU214 axe at bottom of page store brands ceased to trade and were absorbed as concessions into other group businesses (for instance, menswear chain SU214 was absorbed into Topman). Miss Selfridge was also reduced significantly in size (though gained a new London flagship store in the former SU214 flagship site) and all remaining standalone Topman stores were replaced by combined Topshop-Topman stores, a process of integration which had begun some years previously. In 2002, Arcadia Group plc was bought by Taveta Investments, owned by Taveta Ltd based in Jersey. Taveta Ltd is owned by Philip Green's family, the only director is Tina GreenWork Smart - Taveta Investments Ltd Taveta Investments (No. 2) Limited Annual report for the year ended29 August 2009 the wife of billionaire Philip Green accordingly Arcadia Group became a private company and was delisted from the London Stock Exchange. By the middle of October 2002, the company had sold some of its chains, including Principles, Warehouse, Racing Green and Hawkshead, to Rubicon Retail for ¬£35m. Those Outfit stores which were already retailing Principles and Warehouse clothing continued to do so by arrangement with the new owners. Arcadia also entered into discussions regarding the sale of the Wade Smith brand back to its previous owners. In 2005, Sir Philip Green bought the UK retail stores of Etam and Tammy; these stores were converted into other Arcadia retail outlets, with Tammy clothing subsequently being retailed through BHS and Outfit stores. Some of the stores not retained by Arcadia were taken up by other fashion retail groups, with Monsoon acquiring a large number of the outlets. In February 2009, it was announced that the BHS department store chain, also owned by the Greens, would be integrated into Arcadia. As part of the changes, some administrative functions previously run separately were intended to be consolidated to improve efficiency, and some BHS retail stores were to begin to carry Arcadia brands as concessions, enabling Arcadia to expand the presence of its brands without having to lease large numbers of new stores, and allow the firm to cut store costs by moving some operations from stand- alone stores into BHS locations. In The Mall Bexleyheath, the firm was able to introduce Wallis to the retail portfolio without having to lease a separate store unit to do so, and was also able to close the existing Evans store and relocate its operations into BHS. Meanwhile, at Lakeside Shopping Centre in Thurrock, Essex, the existing two-floor BHS was replanned to a reformatted single-level store to allow Topshop/Topman to relocate from their prior site (itself earlier expanded into the neighbouring ex-Etam premises) to take up what was previously the upper level of BHS. (The previous Topshop/Topman space was itself used to introduce Forever 21 to the centre). In late 2010 it emerged Arcadia was considering a review of its property portfolio, similar to those undertaken under the Townprint and BrandMAX schemes, to look at the firm's store distribution; this was sparked by the fact that several hundred of the firm's existing store leases expire over the coming three to five years. Analysts estimated that between 150 and 300 stores could be shut and replaced with new locations or integrated/combined stores. After Phillip Green confirmed that the number of stores under lease was to fall, in 2013-14, Arcadia began shutting stores in a number of locations, mostly in small-to- medium-sized towns and cities, including South Shields, Barnsley, Scunthorpe, Dartford, Crawley, Erdington, Birmingham and Market Harborough amongst others. Arcadia cited the rise in online shopping and \\"destination\\" centres as a reason for moving away from high street locations. In March 2015, following continued losses BHS was sold to Retail Acquisitions Ltd. In March 2019, after continued losses, it was reported that Sir Philip Green was exploring a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to restructure the company. The plan is feared to lead to more shop closures and job losses. A month later, two restructuring specialists were added to the Arcadia Group's board to oversee the implementation of the CVA. Amongst the 2020 UK Outbreak of COVID-19, the group cancelled ¬£100m of clothing orders which added to growing concerns of labour rights organisations of the impact on garment manufacturers globally.

The Greens bought BHS for ¬£200m in 2000. before selling it in 2015 for ¬£1 to serial bankrupt businessman Dominic Chappell. By the time of its sale to Chappell, the company had a pension deficit of ¬£571m. The pension deficit was attributed to Philip Green having paid hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends to his family and to Richard Caring. Richard Caring, a personal friend of Philip Green who secretly owned a stake in BHS in the early 2000s was handed out ¬£93m in dividends. = Sexual harassment and bullying allegations = In October 2018, The Daily Telegraph reported that \\"a leading businessman has been granted an injunction against The Telegraph to prevent this newspaper revealing alleged sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff\\". The following day, in the House of Lords, Labour peer Peter Hain exercised parliamentary privilege to name Green as the subject of the allegations. In response to the allegations, many media and members of the public launched a boycott campaign against Topshop. In March 2019, newspapers The Sun and The Telegraph published a video of Philip Green kissing one of his former employee and referring to her as \\"naughty\\", providing further evidence to support claims that Philip Green had been behaving inappropriately to some of his female employees. = Links to Richard Caring = Philip and Tina Green have been at the centre of a number of controversies involving themselves and Richard Caring. In February 2015, a note from HSBC bankers in Richard Caring's files mentioned that Philip Green's wife Tina Green had been holding part of Richard Caring's assets in cash on his behalf, prompting suspicions that Richard Caring might have funnelled profits through Tina Green to avoid paying taxes on his assets. In December 2014, Michelle Young accused Philip Green, Richard Caring and Simon Cowell of helping her ex-husband Scot Young hide his assets so as to avoid paying maintenance to his ex-wife and their two daughters.

Trans Service Airlift (TSA), was a private company headquartered at Ndjili Airport, Kinshasa. The Electra was one of a number of ageing aircraft operated by TSA. Built in 1959 it was sold to TSA in 1992, after service with other operators. On the date of the accident, the aircraft was flying a special charter for UNITA. Following the 1993 trade embargo on UNITA there were frequent \\"sanction busting\\" flights out of Zaire. TSA was one of the companies cited in connection with these operations. These flights rarely carried weapons (which were typically supplied over ground routes); usual cargoes were personnel, fuels, food, and medical supplies. The Angolan Government later claimed the aircraft was carrying weapons. The aircraft, with 139 passengers and five crew members, was carrying forty more people than the plane was designed to carry, without taking cargo into account. It crashed two minutes after take-off. Some reports speculate that cargo may have slid to the back of the plane, resulting in a weight imbalance and causing the crash. Initial reports by Zairean officials stated that the plane crashed near Cahungula, Lunda Norte Province, while transporting diamond miners from Zaire's capital, Kinshasa. The co-pilot and two passengers survived the initial crash. The accident was the deadliest plane crash in 1995 until the crash of American Airlines Flight 965 two days later. It remains the deadliest ever plane crash in Angola.

The tribe was pagan until Islam came to Arabia. The centre of Malik's clan was Butah. Famous for his generosity and hospitality, Malik is said to have kept a light burning outside his house all night so that any traveller passing that way would know where to find shelter and food. He would get up during the night to check the light. A strikingly handsome man, he had a thick head of hair and his face, a contemporary has said, was \\"as fine as the moon.\\" He was skilful in the use of weapons and noted for his courage and chivalry, and he was an accomplished poet. Malik possessed all the qualities which the Arabs looked for in the perfect male. He was married to Layla bint al-Minhal who was considered to be one of the most beautiful women in Arabia. In view of his distinguished position in the tribe and his unquestionable talents, Muhammad appointed him as an officer over the clan of Bani Handhalah. His main responsibility was the collection of taxes and their despatch to Madinah. Later, when the news of Muhammed's death reached Butah, Malik had just collected a good deal of tax but not yet despatched it to Madinah. He at once opened the coffers and returned the money to the taxpayers. \\"O Bani Handhalah!\\" he announced, \\"your wealth is now our own.\\" Malik was a chief of some distinction; a warrior, noted for his generosity; and a famous poet. Bravery, generosity and poetry were the three qualities most admired among the Arabs. Attack on Malik ibn Nuwayra During the Ridda wars, which broke out in Arabia after the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr sent his most talented general, Khalid bin Waleed, into Najd with 4000 men, to submit the tribes of the surrounding areas. Malik was guilty for his acts against the state of Madinah. After the death of Muhammad, he broke in open revolt against Madinah. At the time of Muhammad, he had been appointed as a tax collector for the Tribe of Banu Tamim. As soon as Malik heard of the appointment of Abu Bakr as caliph, he gave back all the tax to his tribesmen. He gave back all the tax to his tribes people, saying that \\"Now you are the owner of your wealth\\".reference=al-Balazuri: book no: 1, page no:107. When Malik heard about Khalid bin Walid's victories against powerful Arab tribes, he ordered his tribesmen not to engage the approaching Khalid in battle, to stay at home, and hope for peace.reference= Tabari: Vol. 2, Page no: 501-502. Malik himself apparently moved away across the desert with his family. Also, so as to prove himself loyal to the state of Madinah (the future Islamic empire), he collected the tax and sent it to Madinah. His riders were stopped by Khalid's army at the town of Battah. Khalid asked them about the signing of a pact with Sajjah but they said it was only to exact revenge on their terrible enemies and that so war does not reach their lands.reference= Tabari: Vol. p. 501-2. When Khalid reached Najd, he found no opposing army, so he sent his cavalry to nearby villages and ordered them to call the Azaan (call for prayers) to each party they meet. Zirrar bin Azwar, a group leader, arrested the family of Malik when they answered the call to prayer. Malik ibn Nuwayra's Death =Shia view= When arrested, Malik was asked by Khalid about his crimes. Malik's response was \\"your master said this your master said that\\" referring to Abu Bakr. Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution and then ‚Äúmarried‚Äù his wife, Layla bint al-Minhal on the same night. Islamically, Khalid would have had to wait for her to complete the waiting period or iddah of a widow which is four months and ten days before he would have been able to marry her. Abu Qatada al-Ansari was a companion of Muhammad who accompanied Khalid from Medina. He was so shocked at Malik's murder by Khalid that he immediately returned to Medina telling Abu Bakr that he would not serve under a commander who had killed a Muslim.(A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims, Ali Razwy, Chapter 55) The death of Malik and Khalid's taking of his wife, Layla, created a controversy. Some officers of his army‚Äîincluding a prominent companion of Muhammad, Abu Qatadah‚Äîbelieved that Khalid killed Malik to take his wife. After the pressure exerted by Umar‚ÄîKhalid's cousin and one of Caliph Abu Bakr's main advisors‚ÄîAbu Bakr called Khalid back to Madina to explain himself. Umar demanded from Abu Bakr the immediate dismissal of Khalid. He said that Khalid had to be put on trial for the twin crimes of murder and adultery. According to Islamic law, Khalid had to be stoned to death. But Abu Bakr defended Khalid, and said that he had simply made \\"an error of judgment and how can I punish the one whose sword is praised by Allah\\" (A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims, Ali Razwy, Chapter 55) =Western historians view= The eminent historian of Islam John Bagot Glubb writes that \\"Abu Bakr sent Khalid b. Waleed into Nejd with 4000 men. Many clans of Banu Taghlib hastened to visit Khalid but the Banu Yarbu' branch of the tribe, under its chief, Malik ibn Nuweira, hung back. Malik was a chief of some distinction, a warrior, noted for his generosity and a famous poet. Bravery, generosity and poetry were the three qualities most admired among the Arabs. Unwilling perhaps to demean himself by bowing to Khalid, he ordered his followers to scatter and he himself moved away across the desert alone with his family. Abu Bakr had given orders that the test to be applied to suspected rebels was that they be asked to repeat the Muslim formula and that they answer the call to prayer. Khalid, however, preferred more aggressive methods and sent out parties of horsemen to round up the fugitives and plunder their property. One such party seized Malik ibn Nuweira and his family and brought them in to Khalid, although they claimed to be Muslims. The men of Medina who were with the army protested vigorously against Khalid's ruthlessness, but without avail. The prisoners were placed under guard but, during the night, Malik ibn Nuweira and his supporters were killed in cold blood. Within 24 hours Khalid had married the widow of his victim. Malik ibn Nuweira had been executed while professing to be a believer. Indeed Khalid's marriage to the beautiful Layla gave rise to the suspicion that Malik had been killed with the object of making her available to the conqueror. The men of Medina, who had already opposed Khalid's ruthless actions, were outraged by the death of Malik. A certain Abu Qatada, an erstwhile friend and companion of Muhammad, hastened to Medina to complain to Abu Bakr, who summoned Khalid to answer the accusation. Umar b. Khattab pressed the caliph to deprive Khalid of his command. Khalid, returning to Medina, claimed that he had not ordered the execution of Malik, but that his instructions to the guards had been misunderstood. Caliph Abu Bakr, whatever he may have thought of the morals of his lieutenant, was aware of his prowess. ‚ÄòI will not sheathe a sword which God has drawn for His service,' he exclaimed. Khalid's excuses were accepted.\\" See also *Layla bint al-Minhal References External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20050831200650/http://www.swordofallah.com/html/bookchapter14page1.htm *http://www.ansar.org/english/q&a.htm; Category:Banu Tamim Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:People executed for apostasy from Islam Category:7th-century Arabs Category:Companions of the Prophet Category:Sahabah favored by Shias ","title":"Malik ibn Nuwayrah"},{"id":"2135959","text":"Owo is a Local Government Area in Ondo State, Nigeria. Between 1400 and 1600 AD, it was the capital of a Yoruba city-state. The local government has a population of 222,262, based on 2006 population census. History In their oral tradition, Owo traces its origins back to the ancient city of Ile-Ife, the cradle of Yoruba culture. Oral tradition also claims that the founders were the sons of the Yoruba deity Odudua, who was the first ruler of Ile-Ife. The early art-historical and archaeological records reinforce these strong affiliations with Ife culture. Owo was able to maintain virtual independence from the neighboring kingdom of Benin, but was on occasion required to give tribute.Smith (1988), Kingdoms of the Yoruba, p. 52. The transmission of courtly culture flowed in both directions between the Benin and the Owo kingdoms. The skill of Owo's ivory carvers was also appreciated at the court of Benin. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Benin's rulers increasingly utilized insignia made from ivory, and imported Owo's art objects and recruited its artisans for their own royal workshops. There were other notable artworks that can be evidently supported.Roll of Owo carvershttp://www.jstor.org/stable/2798654 Owo came under British rule in 1893. After Nigeria declared independence in 1960, it was part of the Western Region until 1967 when it became part of the Western State. Owo and its indigenes played significant roles in the politics of the first Republic in Nigeria. In 1976, it became part of the newly created Ondo State. The Palace of the Olowo of Owo is the largest Palace in Africa. Culture Owo has the largest palace (Aghofen) in Africa which was declared a national monument by the federal government. The Olowo Palace had as many as 100 courtyards (Ugha). Each courtyard had a specific function and was dedicated to a particular deity. The largest, said to have been twice the size of an American football field, was used for public assemblies and festivals. Some courtyards were paved with quartz pebbles or broken pottery. Pillars supporting the veranda roofs were carved with statues of the king mounted on a horse or shown with his senior wife. The most recent Olowo was Oba Folagbade Olateru Olagbegi III. Economy The present-day city is an agricultural center involved in the growing and trade of yams, cassava, maize, okra, peppers, cocoa, and cotton. There are, however, other meaningful commercial activities in the town, including but not limited to: timber and sawmilling, Soya bean processing plants and blockmaking industries. The town is dotted with branches of some of the foremost banks like, First Bank Plc, Wema Bank Plc, Skye Bank Plc, Enterprise Bank Ltd. (formerly Omega Bank Plc), etc. The city is now witnessing a dramatic change due to expansion of its road network, particularly dualization of the main road beginning from Emure junction up to Iyere exit. A new ultra-modern market is now open in Owo. Geography Owo is situated in south-western Nigeria, at the southern edge of the Yoruba Hills, and at the intersection of roads from Akure, Kabba, Benin City, and Siluko. Owo is situated halfway between the towns of Ile Ife and Benin City. Archaeology The Owo site was first excavated in 1969‚Äì1971 by Ekpo Eyo under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of the Government of Nigeria. Due to Owo's location between the two famous art centers of Ife and Benin, the site reflects both artistic traditions. Important discoveries include terracotta sculptures dating from the 15th century. The Owo Museum, founded in 1968, houses many of these artifacts.

The term was coined as an analogy to that in photography. It can refer to an System snapshot copy of the state of a system or to a capability provided by certain systems.  Rationale  A full backup of a large data set may take a long time to complete. On multi-tasking or multi-user systems, there may be writes to that data while it is being backed up. This prevents the backup from being atomic and introduces a version skew that may result in data corruption. For example, if a user moves a file into a directory that has already been backed up, then that file would be completely missing on the backup media, since the backup operation had already taken place before the addition of the file. Version skew may also cause corruption with files which change their size or contents underfoot while being read. One approach to safely backing up live data is to temporarily disable write access to data during the backup, either by stopping the accessing applications or by using the locking API provided by the operating system to enforce exclusive read access. This is tolerable for low-availability systems (on desktop computers and small workgroup servers, on which regular downtime is acceptable). High- availability 24/7 systems, however, cannot bear service stoppages. To avoid downtime, high-availability systems may instead perform the backup on a snapshot‚Äîa read-only copy of the data set frozen at a point in time‚Äîand allow applications to continue writing to their data. Most snapshot implementations are efficient and can create snapshots in O(1). In other words, the time and I/O needed to create the snapshot does not increase with the size of the data set; by contrast, the time and I/O required for a direct backup is proportional to the size of the data set. In some systems once the initial snapshot is taken of a data set, subsequent snapshots copy the changed data only, and use a system of pointers to reference the initial snapshot. This method of pointer-based snapshots consumes less disk capacity than if the data set was repeatedly cloned.  Implementations  = Volume managers = Some Unix systems have snapshot-capable logical volume managers. These implement copy-on-write on entire block devices by copying changed blocksjust before they are to be overwritten within \\"parent\\" volumesto other storage, thus preserving a self-consistent past image of the block device. Filesystems on such snapshot images can later be mounted as if they were on a read-only media. Some volume managers also allow creation of writable snapshots, extending the copy-on-write approach by disassociating any blocks modified within the snapshot from their \\"parent\\" blocks in the original volume. Such a scheme could be also described as performing additional copy-on-write operations triggered by the writes to snapshots. On Linux, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) allows creation of both read-only and read-write snapshots. Writable snapshots were introduced with the LVM version 2 (LVM2). = File systems = Some file systems, such as WAFL,WAFL is not a file system. WAFL is a file layout that provides mechanisms that enable a variety of file systems and technologies that want to access disk blocks. fossil for Plan 9 from Bell Labs, and ODS-5, internally track old versions of files and make snapshots available through a special namespace. Others, like UFS2, provide an operating system API for accessing file histories. In NTFS, access to snapshots is provided by the Volume Shadow-copying Service (VSS) in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 and Shadow Copy in Windows Vista. Melio FS provides snapshots via the same VSS interface for shared storage. Snapshots have also been available in the NSS (Novell Storage Services) file system on NetWare since version 4.11, and more recently on Linux platforms in the Open Enterprise Server product. EMC's Isilon OneFS clustered storage platform implements a single scalable file system that supports read-only snapshots at the file or directory level. Any file or directory within the file system can be snapshotted and the system will implement a copy-on-write or point-in-time snapshot dynamically based on which method is determined to be optimal for the system. On Linux, the Btrfs and OCFS2 file systems support creating snapshots (cloning) of individual files. Additionally, Btrfs also supports the creation of snapshots of subvolumes. On AIX, JFS2 also support snapshots. Sun Microsystems ZFS has a hybrid implementation which tracks read-write snapshots at the block level, but makes branched file sets nameable to user applications as \\"clones\\". Time Machine, included in Apple's Mac OS X v10.5 operating system, is not a snapshotting scheme but a system-level incremental backup service: it merely watches mounted volumes for changes and copies changed files periodically to a specially-designated volume using hard links.Time Machine is not a file system and it does not make use of a snapshotting feature. It is only included here as a reference. This is because the HFS Plus file system does not have a snapshotting feature; Apple's new APFS file system introduces such a feature. = Operating systems = The Phantom OS is based on a snapshot concept, saving the state of all applications by design.

Snapshots render memorable moments in imperfect images. Here, glare exposes the photographer and implies a close and familiar relationship to the subject. exerciser stretching. A snapshot is a photograph that is \\"shot\\" spontaneously and quickly, most often without artistic or journalistic intent and usually made with a relatively cheap and compact camera. Common snapshot subjects include the events of everyday life, often portraying family members, friends, pets, children playing, birthday parties and other celebrations, sunsets, tourist attractions and the like. Snapshots can be technically \\"imperfect\\" or amateurish: poorly framed or composed, out of focus, and/or inappropriately lighted by flash. Automated settings in consumer cameras have helped to obtain a technologically balanced quality in snapshots. Use of such settings can reveal the lack of expert choices that would entail more control of the focus point and shallower depth of field to achieve more pleasing images by making the subject stand out against a blurred background. Snapshot photography can be considered the purest form of photography in providing images with the characteristics that distinguish photography from other visual media ‚Äî its ubiquity, instantaneity, multiplicity and verisimilitude.The Snapshot Aesthetic Museum of Contemporary Arts, Los Angeles  History =Instantaneous photography= When photography was introduced in 1839, exposure times took several minutes. To obtain a reasonably clear image, the camera could not be handheld and the photographer looked through the back of the camera under a black cloth before loading a sensitive plate, while his subjects had to stay totally still. Special head-rests and arm-rests could be used, and even if a subject managed to stay comfortable under these circumstances, they had to try to keep their facial expression in check if they wanted their features to properly show on the picture. This made it impossible to capture any spontaneity. During the following decades all kinds of improvements, new processes and faster light- sensitive emulsions were developed. Rather than removing and replacing a lens cap or other cover or screen, mechanical shutters started to be applied for better control of exposure times. With the development of instantaneous photography, experimental photographers hoped to capture all the details that had remained blurry or vague in previous photographic techniques. A more natural expression in portraiture was considered a priority, while others desired to be able to photograph atmospheric details in landscapes. In the 1850s, the earliest examples of \\"instantaneous photography\\" were made. Much was pioneered not by ambitious fine artists, but by commercial photographers catering to a public that mostly fancied affordable small formats, such as cabinet cards and stereo views. Subjects often reflected popular recreational activities of the time. As spending time at the beach had become a favorite pastime in pioneering countries France and England, seashore views became a very popular topic and the clarity of waves in such pictures illustrated the developing instantaneous techniques very well. Initially, practitioners were satisfied if they could capture something of the shapes of waves. An albumen seaside view at Boulogne-sur-Mer by Edmond Bacot was a very early example, supposedly made in May 1850. The experimental albumen glass negative showed many waves as an undefined white area in a picture with a relatively high contrast. John Dillwyn Llewelyn exhibited several early instantaneous pictures of the seaside, in London in 1854 and at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855. These were well-received by critics, with detailed analysis of how well the waves were pictured. Llewelyn probably was an early adopter of the use of an automatic shutter, but it's uncertain when he would have started this practice. Exposure times for instantaneous photography were generally understood to be one second or less, but the term lacked a set definition and some would even claim their photographs exposed for up to 30 seconds could be called instantaneous. Thomas Skaife discovered that smaller lenses and smaller photographs needed smaller exposure times and developed his small \\"Pistolgraph\\" camera in 1859. By the end of the year, he claimed that he and his pupils had made some 500 pictures using the hand-held camera with spring- shutters. The tiny \\"pistolgrams\\" could best be viewed with a magnifying glass, but it was also possible to make enlargements (an uncommon practice at the time), hundreds of times the size of the original, with sufficient sharpness. A broche-sized original \\"chromo-crystal\\" example depicting three children was praised by the Brighton Herald: \\"the laughing, mocking eye of the pet in the centre is, indeed, a photographic triumph, and the characters of the two others are unmistakeably stamped upon their features.\\" In 1860, John Herschel wrote about \\"the possibility of taking a photograph, as it were, by a snap- shot ‚Äî of securing a picture in a tenth of a second of time\\". Herschel believed this was already possible at the time, or otherwise would soon be. He also took for granted that this was just one step away from the realization of stereoscopic motion pictures. =Kodak influence= The snapshot concept was introduced to the public at large by Eastman Kodak, which introduced the Brownie box camera in 1900. Kodak encouraged families to use the Brownie to capture moments in time and to shoot photos without being concerned with producing perfect images. Kodak advertising urged consumers to \\"celebrate the moments of your life\\" and find a \\"Kodak moment\\". =Polaroid cameras= Instant cameras, that would develop and fix a picture immediately after shooting it, were developed and successfully marketed by Edwin H. Land's Polaroid Corporation since 1948. Several other companies followed the example. At the time, most other cameras would produce a negative that had to be developed and fixed with chemicals, and then reproduced as enlarged prints in dark rooms or laboratories. Many professional photographers and filmmakers used the technique as quick test and reference material before engaging in the more time-consuming definitive production of their work, of which results could only be viewed much later. These snapshot polaroids often focused on Instant cameras also had some success on the consumer market, but never became as widely used by amateurs as the cheaper systems with negative film rolls. =Snapshot aesthetic= An early theorist of snapshot aesthetic was the Austrian architectural critic, Joseph August Lux, who in 1908 wrote a book called K√ºnstlerische Kodakgeheimnisse (Artistic Secrets of the Kodak) in which he championed the use of Kodak cameras like the Brownie. Guided by a position that was influenced by the Catholic critique of modernity, he argued that the ease of use of the camera meant that people could photograph and document their surroundings and thus produce, what he hoped, was a type of stability in the ebb and flow of the modern world.Mark Jarzombek. \\"Joseph August Lux: Theorizing Early Amateur Photography - in Search of a \\"Catholic Something\\",\\" Centropa 4/1 (January 2004), 80-87. The term 'snapshot aesthetic' arose with a trend within fine art photography in the USA from around 1963 . The style typically features apparently banal everyday subject matter and off-centered framing. Subject matter is often presented without apparent link from image- to-image and relying instead on juxtaposition and disjunction between individual photographs. The originator of the American trend was Robert Frank, with his book of photographs, The Americans, published in 1958. The snapshot tendency was promoted by John Szarkowski, who was head of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art from 1962 to 1991, and it became especially fashionable from the late 1970s until the mid-1980s. Notable practitioners include Garry Winogrand, Nan Goldin, Wolfgang Tillmans, Martin Parr, William Eggleston, and Terry Richardson. In contrast with photographers like W. Eugene Smith and Gordon Parks, these photographers aimed \\"not to reform life, but to know it.\\" Frank has said \\"I was tired of romanticism, [ . . . ] I wanted to present what I saw, pure and simple.\\" Szarkowski brought to prominence the work of Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand in his influential exhibition ‚ÄúNew Documents‚Äù at the Museum of Modern Art in 1967, in which he identified a new trend in photography: pictures that seemed to have a casual, snapshot-like look and had subject matter that seemed strikingly ordinary. Winogrand has said \\"When I'm photographing, I see life, [ . . . ] That's what I deal with. I don't have pictures in my head‚Ä¶ I don't worry about how the picture is going to look. I let that take care of itself‚Ä¶ It's not about making a nice picture. That anyone can do.\\" Later photographers such as Daid≈ç Moriyama, Hiromix, Ryan McGinley, Miko Lim, and Arnis Balcus gained international recognition thanks to the snapshot aesthetic. From the early 1990s the style became the predominant mode in fashion photography, especially within youth fashion magazines such as The Face and photography from this era is often associated with the so-called 'heroin chic' look (a look often seen as having been influenced particularly by Nan Goldin). The term arose from the fascination of artists with the 'classic' black-and-white vernacular snapshot, the characteristics of which were: 1) they were made with a hand-held camera on which the viewfinder could not easily 'see' the edges of the frame, unlike modern cheap digital cameras with electronic viewfinder, and so the subject had to be centred; and 2) they were made by ordinary people recording the ceremonies of their lives and the places that they lived and visited. =21st century: camera phone photography= The tradition of increasingly automating the \\"snapshot camera\\" continues with inexpensive point-and-shoot digital cameras and camera phones that fully automate flash, ISO, focus, shutter speed, and many other functions that ensure balanced quality in the results. Camera phones, usually kept within reach for most of the day, have made taking, sharing and online publishing of snapshots an ubiquitous everyday practice around the world. Camera phone photography has become an art form in its own right.

His family migrated to Medina with Muhammad to escape the religious persecution of the Quraysh in Mecca. Usama had a close relationship with Muhammad and he fought with Muhammad in the Battle of Hunayn.mahallati, vol.2, p. 26 Ibn Kathir writes that according to Ibn Ishaq, Jabir ibn Abd Allah, who witnessed the battle, reported that the Muslim army were panicked by a surprise attack from the enemy and many men fled the battlefield. However, a group of Muhajirun stood firmly and defended Muhammad the battlefield. These men were Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith, Fadl ibn Abbas, Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith, Usama ibn Zayd and Ayman ibn Ubayd. Usama's half- brother Ayman ibn Ubayd was killed that day whilst defending Muhammad. Ibn Kathir, The Battles of the Prophet, p. 175-176 Expedition of Usama ibn Zayd The Expedition of Usama bin Zayd was a military expedition of the early Muslim Caliphate led by Usama ibn Zayd that took place in June 632, in which Muslim forces raided Byzantine Syria.Gil, A history of Palestine, 634-1099, p. 31. After the Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad appointed Usama ibn Zayd as the commander of an expeditionary force which was to invade the region of Balqa in the Byzantine Empire. Muhammad commanded all the sahaba, except for his family, to go with Usama to Syria to avenge the Muslims‚Äô defeat at the Battle of Mu'tah, in which Usama's father and Muhammad's adopted son, Zayd ibn Harithah, had been killed. Usama's leadership was initially rejected by some because of his young age at the time, however Muhammad dismissed these concerns.Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar (Free Version), p. 303 In reference to this event, the Sahih al-Bukhari states that: However, soon after the expedition was dispatched, news was received of Muhammad's death, forcing the army to return to Medina. The campaign was not reengaged until leadership of the community passed to Abu Bakr, who chose to honour Muhammad's wishes and reaffirmed Usama's command. Usama's campaign was successful and his army was the first Muslim force to successfully invade and raid Byzantine territory, thus paving the way for the subsequent Muslim conquest of the Levant and Muslim conquest of Egypt, both of which took place during Usama's lifetime.

Features included a delta wing and a drooped nose. On 6 October 1954, the Delta 2 made its maiden flight, flown by Fairey test pilot Peter Twiss; two aircraft would be produced. The Delta 2 was the final aircraft to be produced by Fairey as an independent manufacturer. The Fairey Delta 2 was the first jet aircraft to exceed 1000 mph in level flight.Flight Magazine 23 March 1956 On 10 March 1956, it set a new world speed record of 1,132 mph. The Delta 2 held the absolute World Air Speed Record for over a year. It continued to be used for flight testing, and was allocated to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in 1958. A testbed aircraft was required to verify design calculations and wind tunnel results for the Concorde \\"ogee delta\\" wing design so one of the aircraft was extensively rebuilt as the BAC 221. On 1 May 1964, the modified aircraft performed its first flight. The FD2 was also used as the basis for Fairey's submissions to the Ministry for advanced all weather interceptor designs, culminating in the proposed Fairey Delta 3 to meet the F.155 specification; however, the FD3 never got past the drawing-board stage. Development =Background= During the late 1940s, Fairey Aviation, a British aircraft manufacturer, had become interested in delta wing technology and proceeded to submit multiple submissions based on the delta wing concept to the Ministry of Supply.Wood 1975, p. 73. The Ministry, being interested in these proposals, issued orders for models to test the envisioned delta wing, the first of which being built in 1947; testing was performed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). The program was succeeded multiple times, including an investigation into potential VTOL operations, leading to further flight tests of the delta wing models to be conducted in Cardigan Bay, Wales and Woomera, Australia.Wood 1975, pp. 73‚Äì74. In 1947, Air Ministry Specification E.10/47 was issued for a full-scale piloted delta wing aircraft, resulting in the Fairey Delta 1, which conducted its maiden flight at RAF Boscombe Down on 12 March 1951.Wood 1975, p. 74. Meanwhile, throughout the early and mid 1950s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had developed an intense desire to advance the performance of their aircraft; in particular, the service sought new fighter aircraft that would be capable of routinely flying at very high speeds and high altitudes as a long- term replacement for its existing inventory of roughly 700 first-generation jet fighters.Wood 1975, p. 71. At the time, there was a perception that Britain was trailing behind in supersonic aircraft design, and there was pressure to correct this.\\"Fairey FD2.\\" Royal Air Force Museum, Retrieved: 13 December 2016. Events such as the Korean War and rapid advances in the fields of supersonic aerodynamics, structures and aero engines by the British aircraft industry had the effect of increasing demand and the potential capabilities of new fighters. In addition to developing improved versions of existing and emerging fighters such as the Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin, there was an appetite for even more promising entirely new aircraft.Wood 1975, pp. 71‚Äì72. Following on from the Delta 1, the Ministry of Supply requested that Fairey conduct a further model programme for the purpose of transonic investigations. However, Fairey did not find this proposal attractive, believing that a piloted aircraft would be mandatory if the project was to produce any worthwhile data. Fairey commenced work on a highly swept twin- engine aircraft; however, the Ministry lacked enthusiasm for the twin-engine configuration, largely due to an existing rival project underway to produce a twin-engine supersonic aircraft ‚Äì this would become the English Electric Lightning.Wood 1975, p. 75. In February 1949, it was suggested that Fairey examine the prospects for a single-engine transonic aircraft as an alternative; by the end of the year, the company had produced their new project, out of which the Fairey Delta 2 (FD2) would directly originate. Accordingly, the Ministry issued Air Ministry Specification ER.103 for the project, ordering that a pair of prototype aircraft be produced. Farnborough in 1956 during that year's SBAC Show using its 'droop snoot' At the time, Fairey was mostly known for producing naval aircraft, such as the Fairey Swordfish biplane and the Fairey Firefly monoplane; the design team lacked experience with high speed projects. As a remedy to this, in October 1951, Sir Robert Lickley of Hawker Aircraft was promptly recruited as Fairey's new Chief Engineer and became a major force behind the programme. Data that had been obtained from the earlier model work also proved to have been highly valuable to the Fairy Delta 2 programme.Wood 1975, pp. 75‚Äì76. Early development work on the FD2 would be hindered by two major factors, a lack of available information on wing and intake design, and the declaring of Fairey Gannet as a 'super-priority' by the British government, which had necessitated delays. In September 1952, technical drawings of the Fairey Delta 2 were issued and the development proper commenced. From the project's beginning, Fairey designed the parameters of the FD2 to intentionally exceed that which was necessary only to achieving Mach 1. In addition to seeking very high performance, the design adopted a general configuration and structure that would be readily adapted to future military requirements, so that it could potentially become a fighter aircraft. In total, a pair of flight-capable aircraft were produced: Serial numbers WG774 and WG777. WG777, the second to be manufactured, was very similar to WG774 apart from the underwing flap system have been eliminated, there were also a few differences in terms of equipment and instrumentation. In addition to the two flying aircraft, a single static test airframe was also completed.\\"Individual History: Fairey FD-2 Delta WG777/7986M.\\" Royal Air Force Museum, Retrieved: 13 December 2016. =Flight testing= On 6 October 1954, WG774, the first FD2 to be completed, conducted its maiden flight, flown by Fairey test pilot Peter Twiss. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the Delta 2 \\"proved to be an exceptional aeroplane from the outset\\". On 17 November 1954, WG774 suffered engine failure on its 14th flight when internal pressure build-up collapsed the fuselage collector tank, closing off the fuel supply to the engine, while heading away from the airfield at 30,000 ft (9,100 m), 30 mi (50 km) after take-off from RAF Boscombe Down. Twiss managed to glide to a dead-stick landing at high speed on the airfield. Only the nose gear had deployed, and the aircraft sustained damage that sidelined it for eight months.Wood 1975, pp. 76‚Äì77. Twiss, who was shaken up by the experience but otherwise uninjured, received the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air.Taylor 1984, pp. 430‚Äì431. One result of the crash was a temporary halt on the test programme, which did not resume until August 1955.Jackson 1986, p. 104. During early flight tests, repeated supersonic test runs over southern Britain were conducted; as a result of these flights, a number of claims for damages against the supersonic booms were received.Twiss, 2000. Tests of the Delta 2's low-level supersonic flight capability were disrupted due to the perceived heightened risk posed by supersonic booms being produced during lower altitude flight; as such, the Ministry of Supply refused to allow this testing to be performed over the UK. As a result of this refusal, Fairey chose to transport the Delta 2 first to France and later to Norway so that the tests could be performed. The French government required the tests to be insured against damage claims; this demand had proved impractical with a British-based insurance company due to unrealistic prices; however, a French company insured them for ¬£40. No claims were ever received in either France or Norway. WG774 with the original polished-metal finish. It later received yellow \\"go faster\\" stripes, followed by a purple and yellow scheme, before conversion to the BAC 221 On 15 February 1956, WG777, the second Delta 2, performed its maiden flight from RAF Boscombe Down; piloted by Twiss, the aircraft proceeded to reach transonic speeds during this first flight. Following the final contractor check flight on 14 April 1956, WG777 was formally accepted, upon which it was assigned to the RAE's high-speed research programme, conducting measurement, stability and handling research. In September 1956, both aircraft performed flight displays at the Farnborough Airshow in Hampshire. The Delta 2 was typically used to conduct a multitude of tests including aerodynamics characteristics, handling, and stability performance. Testing of the Delta 2 was carried out in France for some time, in part due to Fairey's good relations with Dassault Aviation of France and the French Air Force. In October and November 1956, a total of 47 low-level supersonic test flights were conducted from Cazaux Air Base, Bordeaux, France; a detachment of Dassault engineers closely observed these trials, learning a great deal about delta wing aircraft from the FD2. Dassault went on to produce the MD.550 Myst√®re-Delta design, which Wood notes \\"bore a striking resemblance\\" to the FD2; the MD.550 design would proceed to be manufactured as the successful Dassault Mirage III fighter.Wood 1975, pp. 85‚Äì86. Wood credits the Delta 2 as having served to confirm Dassault's theories and supporting the designing and development of the Mirage III.Wood 1975, p. 86. Once the manufacturer's testing was completed, both aircraft were formally handed over to the RAE. In addition to providing the institution with useful information on the characteristics of the 60¬∞-swept delta wing, from 1958 onwards, the FD2 aircraft participated in various research projects and flying trials, including an investigation into the performance of ejector-type propulsive nozzles. The substantial rebuilding of the aircraft to participate in further research was first mooted in that same year as well. In its original configuration, the Delta 2 performed flight tests, interspersed with periods of storage, up until mid-1966. =Breaking the world airspeed record= During August 1955, the Delta 2 transitioned between subsonic and supersonic flight without any use of reheat. According to Wood, many members of the development team recognised that the FD2 possessed huge speed potential, beyond any other British-built aircraft in existence of that time.Wood 1975, p. 77. During early flight testing, Twiss came to realise that the Delta 2 would be capable of speeds above 1,000 miles per hour and proposed that it be flown on with the aim of breaking the current air speed record, which had then been held since 1955 by a North American F-100 Super Sabre.\\"50 years ago: 16 Mar 1956.\\" Flight International, 10 March 2006. However, Fairey found the Ministry of Supply unsupportive, having adopted the prevailing belief being that manned military aircraft would soon be replaced by guided missiles. Fairey had great difficulty in obtaining permission for the attempt. Twiss stated that the situation was \\"curiously inverted\\" from expectations, having expected that government agencies would have been enthusiastically pressing for a record- breaking flight as a means to bolster national prestige.Wood 1975, pp. 77‚Äì78. According to Wood, Fairey was confronted by a combination of scepticism and apathy from Her Majesty's Civil Service, to the extent that it appeared that the government were opposing the endeavor.Wood 1975, p. 78. The Ministry of Supply sought to avoid any association with a speed record bid while Rolls- Royce, the FD2's engine manufacturer, also dismissed the attempt, claiming that the air intakes were unsuitable for speeds around Mach 1.5, and that the Avon engine would disintegrate at such speeds, despite an absence of any practical data to support this assertion. In spite of this opposition, Fairey sought to continue, and were given permission to proceed. The Ministry provided no financial support, having opted instead to loan the aircraft itself to Fairey and to charge the firm for its use of RAE assets. Fairey also had to finance its own insurance.Wood 1975, pp. 78‚Äì79. Regardless, Fairey chose to continue with the record attempt. The first Fairey Delta 2 (s/n WG774) in flight, circa 1956 In order to reduce the risk of another competitor beating them to it, preparations had to be carried out in a short space of time and in great secrecy. The development and deployment of equipment suitable for the accurate measurement of flight at such speeds was a challenge in itself. For this purpose, a variety of ground measurement cameras were set up at Chichester and at RNAS Ford, various ground markers were installed at specified locations, and radar tracking from RNAS Ford and RAF Sopley; flights by Gloster Meteors and de Havilland Venoms for calibration purposes were also conducted by the RAF. Operational demands on both the pilot and ground crews were severe and many runs were attempted but failed to qualify on one technicality or another. On the final day available, the first run also failed; the second and last run that day became the only chance left before the attempt would end. On 10 March 1956, the Fairey Delta 2 broke the World Air Speed Record, raising it to 1,132 mph (1,811 km/h) or Mach 1.73. This achievement exceeded the prior recorded airspeed record by 310 mph, or 37 per cent; never before had the record ever been raised by such a vast margin.Wood 1975, p. 79. The achievement had also made the Fairey Delta 2 the first jet aircraft to exceed 1,000 mph (1,600 km/h) in level flight. News of the new airspeed record quickly spread and made an equally prompt impact upon the international aeronautics industry, typical reactions being shock and near- disbelief. According to Wood, consequences included in-depth studies of the FD2 airframe by the United States and the major reshaping of military aircraft programs in France. Fairey itself was elated with the achievement, viewing it as a practical endorsement of their design, and fuelled the firm's ambitions to establish a family of supersonic fighters on its basis. The record stood until 12 December 1957, when it was beaten by a McDonnell JF-101A Voodoo of the United States Air Force.Taylor, 1984, pp. 431‚Äì433. =Proposed derivatives= Fairey produced a number of proposals which would have involved the further development of the Delta 2. The first of these was another experimental aircraft, designated as the ER.103/B, which would have paired the wings of the FD2 with a revised fuselage, which had a greater span and length. The ER.103/B was to have been powered by either a de Havilland Gyron or Rolls- Royce RB.122 and would have accommodated underwing fuel tanks for extended endurance. A combat fighter model, the ER.103/C, was also proposed, upon which the wings would have been scaled up by 50 per cent, with no radical aerodynamic alterations made. Combat equipment would have been provisioned, including a Ferranti-built Airborne Interception Radar 1495 and de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles.Wood 1975, pp. 79, 82. Fairey claimed that the ER.103/C would be capable of attaining Mach 2.26 at an altitude of 55,000 feet. According to Fairey's projections, the ER.103/B could have been ready to fly within eighteen months of having received an order, while the ER.103/C could reach the same readiness within 30 months.Wood 1975, p. 82. In particular, Fairey pursued Operational Requirement F.155, which called for a two-seat fighter equipped with radar and missiles with suitable performance to achieve an altitude of 60,000 feet and Mach 2 within six minutes of taking off; while the company thought the firm thought that their design would be able to fully capable of meeting the specified requirements, it was believed that the complete weapon system would not be fully developed until 1962. Thus, Fairey proposed that a simpler interim aircraft, if selected, could be available by 1960 or potentially earlier.Wood 1975, pp. 82‚Äì83. In addition to the Gyron engine of earlier proposals, the proposed fighter was to be equipped with a pair of de Havilland Spectre rocket engines that were mounted in fairings on the rear fuselage.Wood 1975, p. 83. The high-test peroxide (HTP) fuel for the rocket engines was stored in tanks held in underwing fairings and within the wing's leading edge, separate from the turbojet engine's fuel storage. It featured a two-man crew, a pilot and radar operator/navigation, seated in a side-by-side configuration. The fuselage was area ruled while large rectangular variable air intakes were adopted. As specified, the fighter was tentatively armed with wingtip-mounted de Havilland Red Top air-to-air missiles. Further design revisions saw the single Gyron engine being replaced by a pair of RB.122 engines instead and the adoption of the Red Dean missile, alongside refinements such as intake improvements and increased internal fuel capacity. Fairey stated that the aircraft was suited to interceptor duties at various altitudes, strike and aerial reconnaissance missions were also mooted. On 1 April 1957, Fairey were informed by officials within the Ministry of Supply that their proposals were the favourite to meet Operational Requirement F.155.Wood 1975, p. 85. However, on 4 April 1957, Duncan Sandys, the Minister of Defence, announced the effective termination of nearly all fighter aircraft development for the RAF, instantly removing the F.155 requirement. A final attempt was made to progress a Delta 2 derivative into production came during the late 1950s for the new German Air Force of West Germany.Wood 1975, pp. 87‚Äì88. Running against a competing American bid with the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter, Fairey joined forces with Rolls-Royce and Dassault in a collaborative effort to produce a delta wing aircraft capable of reaching Mach 2 to meet the German demand for fighter aircraft. The proposal would have seen Dassault produce the wings, Fairey manufacture the fuselage, and Rolls-Royce provide the engine, which was intended to be a Rolls-Royce Spey engine with reheat; Belgium also played a role in the programme.Wood 1975, p. 88. However, the American lobby proved to be too strong, in part due to the subsequently uncovered Lockheed bribery scandals that had influenced German decision makers, and the F-104G was selected instead. This was the end for the FD2 as a fighter concept; the concept never saw any use as a production aircraft; Wood summarised the state of affairs as \\"the harvest was left to France to gather\\".Wood 1975, pp. 86, 88. =BAC 221= Development of the Concorde harnessed a then-new type of delta wing that was being developed at the RAE known as the ogee or ogival delta design. This design aimed to improve both supersonic performance through limited span, and low-speed performance through the creation of vortices between the wing and fuselage that increased air velocity over the wing and thereby increased lift. In order to make full use of this effect, the wing should be as long as possible, and highly swept at the root. Continued studies of this basic concept led to the ogee layout and it eventually become apparent that a series of full-scale flight tests would be necessary for its validation.Flight 1964, p. 133. BAC 221 at the Fleet Air Arm Museum. The forward extension and general curving layout can be seen Low- speed testing of the concept was already being provided by the Handley Page HP.115. Although high-speed performance appeared to be predictable, a dedicated testbed aircraft was desired, especially for drag measurements. As early as 1958, the RAE and Fairey began discussions about converting one of the Delta 2 prototypes to support the ogee wing.Jarrett 2002, p. 179. Fairey proposed stretching the fuselage a further three feet to better match the long planform, with the wing extending out onto the drooping nose. However, calculations showed that this extension was not great enough to counter the forward moving centre of pressure (CoP) that resulted from the extended planform, and there were also concerns that the over-wing engine intakes would swallow the vortex above the wing. During 1960, further development activity was disrupted by the purchase of Fairey by Westland Aircraft, who assigned further work on the conversion project to Hunting Aircraft. Accordingly, in July 1960, the programme moved to Bristol and was now a part of the larger British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Bristol suggested two ways forward, a minimal conversion with a sub-optimal wing but no other major changes, or a \\"maximal\\" conversion with a larger six foot extension to the fuselage and a much taller landing gear more typical of the type expected on the Concorde. Both would also be equipped with a new Elliott Brothers stabilization system, and have the engine intakes moved under the wing. The minimal conversion was considered to be more of a 'compromise', being less slender and lacking the additional fuel capacity that the maximal option provided for.Flight 1964, pp. 133‚Äì134. In early September 1960, it was agreed that the \\"maximal\\" conversion would proceed; on 5 September of that year, WG774 was flown to Bristol's Filton facility. Following a period of detailed design work, the re- manufacturing process commenced in April 1961. Considerable cost-cutting measures and management strategies, such as PERT, were adopted by BAC in order to not overrun on the fixed-price contract it had been issued for the work; some engineers were allegedly frustrated by this as apparent means of further improvement were dismissed. On 7 July 1961, the newly christened BAC 221 was completed.Flight 1964, p. 134. Various problems were encountered during the conversion. The newly lengthened landing gear required more hydraulic fluid, which required a larger reservoir to hold it, a higher capacity pump to move it quickly enough through the system, and so on through the hydraulic system. Moving the intakes below the wing meant they were no longer in-line with the compressor face so the ducting to the engine was curved upwards giving a noticeable bulge on the wing upper surface. No attempt was made to fit variable intakes. At high throttle settings, considerable suction into the inlets was generated; in the event of a sudden down-throttle motion by the pilot would result in air \\"spilling\\" out of the intakes, which was a concern because it could flow above the wing and disrupt the vortex. Small lips were added to the intakes to help prevent this, but this proved to cause intake buzzing. Changes to the ducts, assisted by Rolls-Royce, addressed this issue.Flight 1964, p. 135. One major advantage of the new design was its larger fuel capacity, which has been a major problem for the original FD2.Flight 1964, pp. 135, 137. The Delta 2 had often run out of fuel while still accelerating, thereby never reaching its full performance. The modifications for the 221 meant it was not capable of the same levels of performance; however, speeds of Mach 1.6 were attained during its test flights. In total, the BAC 221 featured a new wing, engine inlet configuration, a Rolls-Royce Avon RA.28, modified vertical stabilizer and a lengthened undercarriage to mimic Concorde's attitude on the ground. It first flew on 1 May 1964.Taylor 1965, p. 130. The sole 221 was used for varied flight testing from 1964 until 1973, after which it was placed on public display. Design Head-on view of an FD2 on static display, June 2016 The Fairey Delta 2 was a mid-wing tailless delta monoplane. It was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Avon RA.14R turbojet engine with reheat.Flight 1964, p. 136. The engine was fed by air intakes which were blended into the wing roots and featured an eyelid-type nozzle. Located just forward of the nozzle were petal-type air brakes. The Delta 2 had a cylindrical cross-section fuselage, which closely fitted the Avon engine, and smoothly flowed into a long tapered nose. A long nose would normally have obscured the pilot's forward vision during landing, take-off and movement on the ground; so, to provide adequate visibility a drooped nose was fitted; the nose section, including the cockpit, could be drooped 10¬∞ using a hydraulically-actuated mechanism, in a similar manner to that which was used later on Concorde.Wood 1975, p. 76. The Delta 2 had a relatively small cockpit for the pilot which left little room for the installation of additional equipment. The Delta was the first British aircraft to fly using all-powered controls. These controls, designed and produced by Fairey, were fully duplicated.Wood 1975, p. 73. The flight control system was hydraulically operated and possessed no mechanical backup. Fairey had recently developed a new high-pressure hydraulic system and this was used in the design. The hydraulics provided no feedback or \\"feel\\" to the pilot's controls, so another system providing artificial feel was necessary. The wing featured a 60¬∞ sweep of the leading edge and was very thin, at only 4% thickness-chord ratio, making the Delta 2's wing one of the thinnest known at that time. The internal space housed both the main undercarriage and a total of four fuel tanks without any bulges or fairings in the wing, while four spars provided for significant structural strength. The sizable horn-balanced ailerons and inboard elevators gave the Delta 2 a high level of manoeuvrability.

History  Prior to the Russian Revolution, the territory of Turkestan, of which Tajikistan was part, used the device of a black unicorn on a golden shield, blazoned or, a unicorn passant sable. However, Tajikistan itself had no symbol. Until 1992, Tajikistan had an emblem similar to all other Soviet Republics. The first emblem of independent Tajikistan from 1992‚Äì1993 was the Lion and Sun symbol, which was a historic symbol of Persia, to which Tajikistan has cultural ties. It was changed to the current version by the government of Emomali Rahmon, which came to power at the end of 1992. Like other post-Soviet republics whose symbols do not predate the October Revolution, the current emblem retains some components of the Soviet one.  Description  The crown at the center of the emblem is the same as the Tajik national flag, and refers to the Persian word taj, meaning crown, from which the name of the Tajik people is said to be derived, according to one interpretation. The base of the emblem contains a representation of a book and the Pamir Mountains. The emblem is flanked by cotton on one side and wheat on the other, as well a banner of the national red-white-green colors of Tajikistan is wrapped around the cotton and wheat replacing the red color with the motto of the Soviet Union \\"Workers of the world, unite!\\" written in the Russian and Tajik languages.

In the , Pinkenba had a population of 368 people.  Geography  Pinkenba is on the northern side of the Brisbane River, from the Brisbane central business district facing Moreton Bay. The area is spatially isolated from other residential suburbs and is surrounded by the Brisbane Airport to the north and west, and industrial land and the bank of the Brisbane River to the south. The neighbourhood of Myrtletown is located () in the northern end of the suburb of Pinkenba. The former suburb and now neighbourbood of Meeandah is located () in the southern end of the suburb of Pinkenba. History Estate map of the Town of Pinkenba, Brisbane, Queensland, 1892 The name Pinkenba comes from the Turrbal word binkinba which means \\"place of land tortoise\\". The former suburb of Meeandah took its name from the now disused Meeandah railway station on the Pinkenbah railway line, which in turn is named after a corruption of the Greek word meander and refers to Serpentine Creek which flowed through the area (but has subsequently been converted into a drain due to the development of Brisbane Airport). The name is often thought to be an Aboriginal word. Boggy Creek State School opened on 22 February 1875. It was renamed Myrtle State School in 1888. In 1900 it was renamed Pinkenba State School. It closed on 31 December 2010. It was located at 248 Eagle Farm Road on the corner of Serpentine Road (). On 15 October 1892 there was an auction of crown land near a new meatworks.leftPinkenba Wharf was the point of embarkation for many World War I soldiers. The Pinkenba & District War Memorial commemorates those from the district who served and died in the war. The memorial was unveiled on 16 August 1919 by the Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams. Qantas selected Pinkenba for its flying boat base in the 1930s. Until the war, Hamilton Reach was too congested, however the base eventually moved upstream providing better access for passengers.alt=Myrtletown State School opened on 1924 and closed on 19 February 1971. It occupied the northern part of the block bounded by Main Beach Road, School Road (now Lewandowski Drive) and Sandmere Street (). St Matthias' Anglican Church was dedicated on 14 February by Canon de Witt Batty. It closed circa 1981. It was located on the south-east corner of Hopper Street and McBride Road (). On 6 March 1963, Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a roadside memorial which commemorates the discovery of commercial quantities of oil in Australia. Although significant oil deposits had been found at Moonie the pipeline to Brisbane was not completed until the following year. The site was selected because it was close to a large oil refinery which was to process the oil. In 1975 Myrtletown (then an independent suburb) was downgraded to a neighbourhood within Pinkenba. Myrtletown was historically known as a residential and farming locality, though Myrtletown has become industrial and portside in recent decades. Pinkenba recorded a population of 350 people at the . As at March 2020, there are two cruise ship wharves for Brisbane, with differing facilities. Portside Wharf at Hamilton was completed in 2006 and is an international standard facility for cruise liners, offering restaurants, coffee shops, gift shops, and other facilities. However, due to the height restrictions of the Gateway Bridge and length restriction of that far upstream, the larger ocean-going cruise liners must dock further down the river at the more industrial Multi User Terminal at the Port of Brisbane. In late 2020 the new Brisbane International Cruise Terminal will open on the northern bank of the Brisbane River in the suburb of Pinkenba opposite the port (). The new cruise terminal is located at Luggage Point next to the Luggage Point Sewage Treatment Plant (which has been renamed the Luggage Point Resource Recovery Centre). The new terminal will be able to accommodate the largest cruise vessels in the world. It will be operated by the port but will not be part of the suburb of Port of Brisbane. Demographics In the , Pinkenba recorded a population of 350 people; 42.9% female and 57.1% male. The median age of the Pinkenba population was 42 years, 5 years above the Australian median. Children aged under 15 years made up 15.4% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 12.8% of the population. 62.5% of people living in Pinkenba were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 7%, Iran 6.8%, England 2.5%, Italy 1.4%, France 0.8%. 77.3% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 2% Italian, 1.7% Cantonese, 1.1% Tagalog, 0.9% Afrikaans, 0.9% Serbo-Croatian/Yugoslavian.

Industry BP's Bulwer Island Refinery and Shell's Pinkenba Terminal are located in Pinkenba. In 2011, Shells operations at Bulwer Island were expanded with the opening of a new bitumen and marine fuel import facility. Shell facilities include their Queensland state office, a bitumen plant, a lubricants and grease manufacturing facility, several warehouses and fuel storage unit. Heritage listings Pinkenba has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Eagle Farm Road: Pinkenba War Memorial * Myrtletown Reserve: RAN Station 9, Pinkenba  Amenities  Pinkenba has a historical trail which was designed on behalf of the Pinkenba Community Association and the Port of Brisbane with help from Brisbane City Council Neighbourhood planning team; more work is still to be done over the next ten years with the beautification of Pinkenba with the start being the local park and historical path and local pub. Numerous development projects have been proposed for the area, including residential developments and an immigration detention centre, but nothing has progressed. The suburb contains a small number of detached houses (primarily of weatherboard construction), local store, pub and industrial precincts.

Biography  A bookkeeper by profession, McAteer was from Derry. He served as IRA Chief of Staff from 1941 until 12 October 1942, when he was captured and arrested by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. He was later sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on the charge of treason. On 15 January 1943, along with three senior IRA men Patrick Donnelly, Ned Maguire and Jimmy Steele, he escaped over the wall from Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast. On Easter Saturday, 24 April 1943, he participated in the Broadway Cinema operation on the Falls Road when armed IRA men took over the cinema, stopped the film, and went on stage and read a statement from the IRA Army Council and the Proclamation of the 1916 Easter Rising. The statement denounced the British military presence in Northern Ireland as an \\"invasion of our rights\\" and warned that they will be targeted in \\"a resumption of hostilities between the Irish Republic and Great Britain\\". McAteer was subsequently rearrested. Along with other IRA prisoners, he was released in 1950. In 1950, McAteer ran as a Sinn F√©in candidate for the Londonderry constituency in the British general election on an independent republican abstentionist ticket. He polled 21,880 votes or 37.41%. (Other Republican candidates included Jimmy Steele (for West Belfast) and Liam Burke (for Mid Ulster). The three candidates polled 23,362 votes together but were not elected.) He also contested the 1964 British general election for the same constituency and on the same ticket, polling 21,123 votes (35.91%). Family McAteer was the third son of Hugh McAteer, a labourer, and Bridget Doherty. He was a brother of Eddie McAteer, leader of the Nationalist Party and Stormont MP. Hugh McAteer's son, Aidan, was a personal assistant to Gerry Adams and onetime staff officer of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Hugh McAteer's grandson, Ronan McGinley, was elected as a Sinn F√©in Councillor in 2014. He served as Mid Ulster Council Group Leader. His many interests included Irish Traditional singing and he even provided the notes for an album entitled \\"Ireland Her Own\\" (Topic Records, 1967), recorded by two former IRA volunteers - Paddy Tunney and Arthur Kearney - who had been imprisoned with him in the Crumlin Road Gaol in the 1940s. Death McAleer died suddenly in Belfast on 24 June 1970. He is buried in Miltown Cemetery, Belfast.

It opened in 1897, rebuilt in 1969 with a second new station closer to the township of Pinkenba, the first station reverted as Shunters Quaters and closed in 1993 to all passenger traffic. History The station c.1935 Pinkenba station in 2007 The Pinkenba line opened 1 April 1897 and during World War I (1914 to 1918) and World War II (1939 to 1945), troop camps were located in Pinkenba and Meeandah localities because of deep berthing available to ships at Pinkenba on the mouth of the Brisbane River. Passenger ships of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, later P&O;, used the adjacent Pinkenba Wharf, and special trains ran from Brisbane to Pinkenba. On 29 August 1906, a contract was let for refreshment rooms to be constructed at Pinkenba station, at a cost of ¬£318. These operated until the new Pinkenba station ‚Äì still standing today ‚Äì opened in 1969. In 1988 part of the line was electrified, but only as far as Eagle Farm station; diesel-hauled carriages infrequently operated passenger services to Pinkenba. On 27 September 1993, all passenger services on the line were suspended by the Goss Labor Party government as part of a statewide rationalisation of the rail network with the closing or suspending of under-utilised or unprofitable rail lines. Current status In 2005, the 1969 Pinkenba railway station area became a rubbish recycling site, with large amounts of dirt dumped over the terminus siding that housed Pinkenba station. The 1969 station building did remain until 2016, although badly damaged and used as a dumping ground, and the track that connected the station to the Pinkenba Line has been removed. By 2017, the building was demolished. QR still owns the land. The original 1897 station building was later removed to a Grain Corp site. Then circa 2001 the station building was cut in half and removed pending the redevelopment of the site.

It educates over 1,400 pupils in three sections ‚Äì Highgate Pre-Preparatory School (ages 3‚Äì7), Highgate junior school (ages 7‚Äì11) and the senior school (11+) ‚Äì which together comprise the Highgate Foundation. As part of its wider work the charity was from 2010 a founding partner of the London Academy of Excellence and it is now also the principal education sponsor of an associated Academy, the London Academy of Excellence Tottenham, which opened in September 2017. The principal business sponsor is Tottenham Hotspur FC. The charity also funds the Chrysalis Partnership, a scheme supporting 26 state schools in six London boroughs. Administration The Foundation is governed in accordance with a Charity Commission Scheme dated 1 September 2005 (and amended in 2014). Its governing body consists of 16 members; four are nominated (one each by the Universities of Oxford and London, by the Bishop of London, and by the Lord Chief Justice), and the rest are co-opted. The Visitor is Her Majesty the Queen. The Head is assisted by Principals of the pre-prep and junior schools, by deputy heads and a Bursar, in managing the Foundation. The school is a member of HMC and IAPS and is one of the twelve schools of the Eton Group. History The school was founded in 1565 by a Royal Charter of Elizabeth I whose letters patent, sealed on 29 January, authorised Sir Roger Cholmeley to establish the ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôFree Grammar School of Sir Roger Cholmeley, Knight at Highgate‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô. Cholmeley, a former Chief Justice and local landowner, decided to found a charitable school \\"for the good education and instruction of boys and young men\\" in Highgate and the local parishes. On 27 April 1565 he was granted by Edmund Grindal, the Bishop of London, some land on the site of the old gatehouse to the Bishop's park and hermit's chapel (opposite the Gatehouse Inn, which still exists). A new chapel and buildings for the school and the local curate, who was expected to be the teacher, were built. The chapel also served as a chapel of ease for Highgate residents.Palmer, Alan, A Short History of Highgate School(1964), in Highgate School Register 1833‚Äì1964 pp9-32. However, by the early nineteenth century a dispute arose because the charity was spending more money, and the curate more time, on the local chapel than on the pupils. A House of Commons commission visited in 1819 and found the Master, the Rev Samuel Mence, was paying a sexton to teach the boys. In a long and bitter action brought in the High Court against the Trustees it was contended that this was contrary to its founding charitable deed. Lord Chancellor Eldon, in his 1827 judgment, agreed, finding \\"the charity is for the sustenance and maintenance of a free Grammar school\\".Richardson, John, Highgate Past(1989), pp61-63. The trustees were forced to comply and a separate local church for Highgate, St Michael's, was built in South Grove after a successful local appeal. Mence struggled on at the school until 1838 when there were only 19 pupils. An expansion of the school occurred under the next headmaster Rev Dr John Bradley Dyne (Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford) between 1838 and 1874. Under Dyne, by the 1870s the school had largely dropped free provision for local parish boys and alongside the day places boarding was encouraged for boys from the upper and upper middle classes; fees were introduced and academic standards improved.In the period up to this time the school was known commonly as the Free Grammar School at Highgate, the Highgate Grammar School, or the Cholmeley School. Like other public schools, Highgate followed Dr Arnold at Rugby School in introducing the house system. Also like other public schools, Dyne flogged the pupils with a birch rod. In the 1860s land was acquired in Bishopswood Road, which provided extensive sports fields and on which several boarding houses and private residences were built. During this period the current chapel and main buildings were erected, designed by Reginald Blomfield (who had also designed Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford). A fragment of the older school building, a gateway with a rusted bell mechanism above between the porter's lodge and the main school building, remained intact until 2006 when the bell was refurbished and the old entrance itself rebuilt in a more modern style. The senior school continues to occupy today the island site in Highgate Village on which it was founded. Until recently the school had two blocks of Eton Fives courts, one structure with ten courts (of which six were built in 1899 and a further four added c.1913); a second block of eight courts constructed in the 1920s was removed in 2014. Boarding and weekly boarding at Highgate declined in the years up to the early 1990s when the last boarders left. In 1993 one of the former houses was converted to create the coeducational pre-preparatory school. In 2001 the school announced its intention to become fully co- educational ending over four hundred years of single sex education, and girls joined the Senior and Junior schools from 2004. According to the Good Schools Guide \\"Its decision to go co-ed has helped to put its popularity and academic standards on upward trajectories\\". In January 2013 the Charter building was opened by former pupil and Governor Lord Hill. In May 2014 the Sir Martin Gilbert Library was opened by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Throughout 2015 the school celebrated its 450th anniversary. In January 2015 a museum opened, which can be visited by the public on Saturday mornings in term-time. In September 2016 a new building for the junior school opened. Houses Chapel Quad, with \\"Big School\\" on the left, and the chapel The school operates a house system like many other public schools and upon reaching Year 9, pupils are placed in a house. These houses are Northgate, Southgate, Westgate, Eastgate, Queensgate, Kingsgate, Midgate, Fargate, Heathgate, The Lodge, School House and Grindal. This system, which Dyne, like other public school headmasters, copied from Arnold's at Rugby School, was established to create \\"house spirit\\" among the students, allowing for both academic and sporting competitions among the houses. Some of these, like School House, Grindal and The Lodge used to be boarding houses. However, other houses, such as Kingsgate, are newer, having been created by a dissaffected group of Westgateans in the 1970s. Head Masters The title Head has been used since March 2015. Notable members of staff With year of joining The Cholmeleian Society and notable Cholmeleians Former pupils of Highgate School are called Cholmeleians or Old Cholmeleians (\\"OCs\\"), after Sir Roger Cholmeley. The alumni are organised as the Cholmeleian Society, founded as the Old Cholmeleian Club in 1893, although annual dinners had been held since 1859. Both the School and the Society organise social events, and a magazine, The Cholmeleian, is published twice a year.

The device, also called a combustible gas detector, operates on the principle of resistance proportional to heat‚Äîa wire is heated, and a sample of the gas is introduced to the hot wire. Combustible gases burn in the presence of the hot wire, thus increasing the resistance and disturbing a Wheatstone bridge, which gives the reading.

Yaji I ruled from 1359 to 1385 CE. A prominent figure in the state's history, using religious revolution, Yaji was finally able to solidify his family's grasp on Kano and its sub- kingdoms after centuries of strife. Since the arrival of the first king of Kano, Bagauda in 999, there had been tension between the newly established aristocracy and the indigenous pagans of Kano. All subsequent Kano Kings engaged in feuds with the pagan population but were unable to gain mastery over them. In 1350, Yaji aided by Soninke Wangara scholars from Mali, relinquished the Hausa Animist Cult of Tsumbubura, and proclaimed Kano a Sultanate. He violently crushed a subsequent rebellion by the animist cult at the Battle of Santolo, waging in the processes the first Islamic Jihad in Sudanic Africa. He conquered the Kwararafa and the numerous Hausa kingdoms around Kano laying the seeds for Kanoan dominance in the Bilad as-Sudan. He died in 1385 having laid the seeds for an eventual Kanoan Empire.  Early life  Ali Yaji was born to the unfortunate 9th King of Kano, Tsamiya and his consort Maganarku. He is a member of the Bagauda Dynasty who are said to be direct descendants of mythical hausa hero Bayadjidda through Bawo, his son with the last Kabara of Daura, Magajiya Daurama. His bad temper as a child earned him the epithet \\"Yaji\\" which is a hausa spice mix.  King of Kano  He became the 11th king of Kano in 1343, succeeding his uncle, Usman Zamnagawa who deposed and murdered his father. Yaji immediately engaged in multiple conquests in Zamna Gaba, Rano and Bunu, reigning at Bunu for two years before proceeding to Kur where he decided to remain. = Establishing Islam in Kano = Though there were elements of the islamic religion in kano, It was during Yaji's reign that Islam became the prominent faith in the kingdom. According to the Kano Chronicles, about forty Soninke Wangara scholars from Mali, led by Abdulrahman Zaite fully converted the King to the Islamic faith after which Yaji proclaimed himself a Sultan. The chronicles listed names of some of the other scholars as Yakubu, Mandawali, Famori, Bilkasirn, Kanaji, Dukere, Sheshe, Kebe, Murtuku, Liman Jibjin Yallabu, the father of Sarkin Pawa, Gurdumlius, Auta, Laual, Liman Madata. Yaji made Zaite Alkali (Qadi), Laual Muezzin, and Gurdamus his Liman (Imam). Auta was also charged with ensuring all animals were slaughtered according to Dhabihah. Yaji then commanded his subjects in all the towns of Kano to observe the five daily salahs to which they obliged. He also built a mosque facing the Kaaba underneath the Kano Sacred Tree. The Sarkin Gazarzawa was however against these new practices and would desecrate their mosque after every prayer. Because of this, a man called Danbugi was put in charge of a militia to guard the mosque. The pagans however would not relent and tried to entice Danbugi and his men away and were able to succeed in luring some of them. Sheshe and Famori decided that the only way to stop the desecration was through prayer and gathered the Muslims for that purpose. According to the Kano Chronicle, the leader of the pagans was struck blind shortly afterwards and soon after all his acolytes involved in befouling the mosque. Yaji was then said to have taunted the leader of the pagans , \\" Be thou Sarki among the blind\\". = Battle of Santolo and Further Conquests = \\"Yaji, conqueror of the rocky heights, scatterer of hosts, lord of the town\\" Yaji, encouraged by his ordeal with the rebellious pagans decided to further spread the religion. For this reason he set his sights on conquering Santolo, the stronghold of the pagans in Kano because he believed every other town will follow him if he was able to succeed. His Wangara counselors advised him that they should pray beside the Moat of Santolo before they wage war. Yaji and his army camped at a place in Santolo called Duji, after which they proceeded to march around Santolo praying until daybreak when a battle ensued. Yaji scored a crucial victory against the pagans in the Battle of Santolo, which would see him hold further successful conquest south of Kano. This culminated in a confrontation with the Kwararafa, where its inhabitants were said to have deserted their land in fear, taking refuge on a hill in Tagara. The Sultan tried to wait them out to force a battle but they instead sent him a hundred slaves to appease him. There are conflicting reports as to whether he died in Kwararafa or after he returned to Kano. He ruled Kano for thirty seven years after which he was succeeded by his brother, Muhammad Bugaya.  Personal life  Yaji had a son Kanajeji with Aunaka. Kananeji became the 13th ruler of Kano. Yaji shared the same father and mother with Sarki Muhammad Bugaya which was unusual or Kanoan rulers in that era due to excess polygamy.  Legacy  Yaji I is considered to be one of the greatest rulers and warriors in Kano's history. He is remembered as the first Sultan of Kano and for waging the first islamic jihad in region. Yaji's actions were pivotal as they cleared the path for Kano's eventual supremacy among the Hausa states and in Sudanic Africa.

It appoints scholars whose research has contributed considerably to the increase of knowledge within their subject. The general goal of the academy is the promotion of interdisciplinary encounters and contacts and the cooperation of representatives of different subjects. History On 12 October 1758 the lawyer Johann Georg von Lori (1723‚Äì1787), Privy Counsellor at the College of Coinage and Mining in Munich, founded the Bayerische Gelehrte Gesellschaft (Learned Society of Bavaria). This led to the foundation by Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria, of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities on 28 March 1759. Count Sigmund von Haimhausen was the first president. The Academy's foundation charter specifically mentions the Parnassus Boicus, an earlier learned society. Originally, the Academy consisted of two divisions, the Class for History (Historische Klasse) and the Class for Philosophy (Philosophische Klasse); natural sciences, including mathematics and physics, were thought of as part of the Class for Philosophy. Today, the Academy is still divided into two classes, but the classes are now the Class for Philosophy and History (which also includes the humanities and social sciences) and the Class for Mathematics and the Natural Sciences. Members In each class, the number of ordinary members is limited to 45, and the number of corresponding members is limited to 80. However, ordinary members at or over the age of 70 are not counted towards this limit; the number of ordinary members is, therefore, usually around 120. During the course of its history, the academy has had numerous famous members including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Grimm brothers, Theodor Mommsen, Anthimos Gazis, Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, Kurt Sethe, Max Planck, Otto Hahn, Albert Einstein, Max Weber, Werner Heisenberg and Adolf Butenandt. The first women were admitted as full members of the academy in 1995, and including the geneticist Regine Kafmann and the Indo-European linguist Johanna Narten. Presidents First president was the chairman of the Mint and Mining Commission, Sigmund, Count of Haimhausen. Further presidents included Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schelling, Justus von Liebig, Ignaz von D√∂llinger, Max von Pettenkofer and Walther Mei√üner. At present, the presidency is held by . Commissions of the Academy For the pursuit of long-term projects, the Academy forms Commissions. At present, 37 Commissions employ more than 450 persons.

History Turvey is recorded in Domesday Book of 1086 as a parish in the Hundred of Willey. There are eight separate entries for Turvey, including a total of 44 households. The Mordaunt family obtained the manor by marriage in 1197 and were ennobled as Barons of Turvey in the 16th century. The Mordaunt family house, Turvey Old Hall, was replaced by Turvey House in 1792, by which time the estate had passed to the Higgins family. It was extended in the 19th century and still stands. There is a second large house in the village called Turvey Abbey, which was historically a family house, but is now a Benedictine monastery. The Church of England parish church of All Saints has Saxon origins but is almost certainly a post-Norman building. It is the largest church in the deanery of Sharnbrook and was in the Diocese of Lincoln until it was transferred to the Diocese of Ely in 1837. Since 1914 it has been in the Diocese of St Albans. It has a 13th-century door with its original ironwork, a Norman baptismal font, a wall painting of the crucifixion and some notable monuments, including monumental brasses.

Early life Bryan Pearce was born in St. Ives, Cornwall, which remained his home for the rest of his life. His father, Walter, was a butcher in St Ives, played rugby for Cornwall, and was later mayor of St Ives. His mother, Mary Warmington, was a painter from another local family. Pearce suffered from the congenital disease phenylketonuria, which affects the normal development of the brain. He attended a special needs school in the 1940s and 1950s and then, encouraged by his mother and, later, by other St. Ives artists, he began drawing and painting in watercolours in 1953 before moving on to oil paint on board and, later, cont√© crayon. He attended Leonard Fuller's St. Ives School of Painting from 1953 to 1957. Artistic career Pearce specialised in paintings of his home town, and the surrounding Penwith area, drawn in typically flat style, with areas of bright colour surrounded by heavy outlines, like stained glass. His learning disabilities gave his art, in the words of Peter Lanyon, an \\"awareness more direct\\" than pure observation. Lanyon also said that \\"Because his sources are not seen with a passive eye, but are truly happenings, his painting is original\\", and \\"It is necessary to accept these works as the labour of a man who has to communicate this way because there is no other.\\" His art has been compared to that of Alfred Wallis. Guided by Denis Mitchell, he joined the Penwith Society of Arts in 1957, and the Newlyn Society of Artists. He had his first solo exhibition at the Newlyn Gallery near Penzance in 1959, and his first solo exhibition in London at the St Martin's Gallery in 1962. Retrospectives were held at various venues from 1966 to 2004, particularly at Penwith Gallery in 1966, the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford in 1975, the Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro in 2000, and the Victoria Art Gallery in Bath in 2004. Examples of his work are held by many public galleries. His business affairs were dealt with first by his family and ultimately by trustees, enabling him to concentrate on his art. In the second half of his career a good deal of his work was produced and sold in the form of prints in relatively small signed, numbered editions. Some of these were small hand-made etchings, with which the artist had a 'hands on' creative involvement; others were full size screenprints made by printer-craftsmen 'after' works in other media. The latter certainly render just over twenty of Pearce's original images, with their pure, expansive areas of specific colours, extremely convincingly. Two of the earliest screenprints, 'St Ives All Round' and 'Newlyn All Round' (both 1976) were printed in black line only. A number of one-colour lithographs also exist. Bryan Pearce's mother, Mary, died in 1997. He died peacefully at home in St. Ives, and his funeral was held at St Ives Parish Church on 22 January 2007. An exhibition was held at the Tate Gallery, St Ives from 3 February - 13 May 2007. It had been planned as a retrospective but became a memorial show. The Bryan Pearce Estate gave a collection of his works from the 1950s to 2006 to the Royal Cornwall Museum. These were shown 17 November 2007 ‚Äì 5 January 2008, at the Museum. Meanwhile, on 12 March 2008, an auction record for a painting by Bryan Pearce was set at Bonham's New Bond Street auction rooms in London when the work \\"St Ives Harbour 1\\" (1965), 20\\" x 46\\", realised a hammer price of ¬£28,000 (with commission around ¬£33,500). This record was soon broken as, in the following May, Pearce's largest known oil painting, 'Penzance Harbour (all round)', oil on board 20.5\\" x 60.5\\", sold for ¬£39000 (with commission around ¬£47,000) at a Penzance auction house, and was destined for the permanent collection at Penlee House, Penzance. In October 2011, his St. Ives (all round) 1977, oil on board 24\\" x 45¬Ω\\", exceeded the pre-sale top estimate at Christies three times over, selling for ¬£55250 (including buyer's premium) making it the most expensive Pearce to-date. Several biographies have been published, including Ruth Jones's The Path of the Son (1976), Marion Whybrow's Bryan Pearce: a private view (1985) and Janet Axten's The Artist and His Work (2004).

The canyon straddles the modern Arizona and New Mexico state line border and connects the Animas Valley of New Mexico, (the New Mexico Bootheel region), with the San Simon Valley of Arizona. An alleged treasure tale, involving a Mexican gang in a sack of Monterrey, Mexico and buried in southeastern Arizona's Skeleton Canyon in the summer and fall of 1881. According to extant stories, a Mexican gang led by Jose Estrada had sacked several banks and cathedrals in Monterrey, taking a large amount of gold and silver bullion, gold statuary, and diamonds. Some stories indicate the items taken include 39 gold bars and a cigarbox full of diamonds. This gang then made their way northwest, towards Arizona, where they were ambushed by American outlaws in the Peloncillo Mountains as they made their way through Skeleton Canyon towards the Animas Valley of New Mexico. Having killed off the Mexican outlaws, the American outlaws supposedly buried the treasure there, and made their way out of the canyon, only to die off one by one in a series of later double-crosses. The treasure remains unrecovered. In treasure hunting there are always true stories, false ones, and those built up from minor events. Skeleton Canyon is of the latter. Between the late 1870s and early 1880s the Clanton Gang operated in that part of Arizona. Their modus operandi was to rustle cattle and sell the stock to the mining towns which sprang up during that time. Their victims included Mexicans, some of whom were involved in legitimate cattle drives, as well as those engaged in the illegal smuggling of various goods. The canyons along the western side of the Pelloncillos were favored as ambush sites, and it is documented that at least four such ambush/robberies took place. On 13 August 1881, in retaliation for one such ambush, Neuman Haynes Clanton was gunned down in the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre. The ambush and robberies in those canyons may have netted the outlaws a small fortune, possibly a few thousand dollars at most, which then grew into the Skeleton Canyon tales today. The large amount that is stated in the tales never existed; a check of newspapers and government sources within Mexico and the U.S. states bordering the area revealed that the source of the treasure, Monterrey, was never sacked and robbed at any time. The legend was dramatized on a 1990 episode of Unsolved Mysteries.

The party became a faction within Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party. Mussolini, who had been a member of the National Alliance (AN) since its foundation, suddenly left that party on 28 November 2003, following the visit of party leader and the Deputy Prime Minister Gianfranco Fini to Israel, where he described fascism as \\"the absolute evil\\" as he apologised for Italy's role as an Axis Power during the Second World War. Mussolini however defended the right of Israel to exist and declared that the world \\"should beg forgiveness of Israel\\".Mussolini: World should 'beg forgiveness of Israel' ‚Äì Haaretz ‚Äì Israel News Mussolini then formed her party and organized a far- right coalition named Social Alternative. That was a surprising move, as Mussolini, during her political career, had always taken social progressive stances on many issues, including abortion, artificial insemination, gay rights and civil unions. She has been an outspoken \\"feminist\\". and has been described by conservative commentators as a \\"socialist\\" and a \\"left-winger\\" The Social Alternative coalition was disbanded after the 2006 general election and by 2007 the party was almost disbanded as most of its original members returned to the National Alliance.

The series was launched as part of ITV's new early evening line-up, with an enormous amount of pre-publicity and trailers promoting the series. The series was written and created by acclaimed screenwriter Caleb Ranson, with other contributors to the series including John Jackson, Jessica Townsend, Cris Cole, Elizabeth Delaney, Jeff Dodds, Robert Fraser, Adrian Hewitt, Martha Jay, Charles Lambert, Ed McCardie, Adrian Pagan, Bradley Quirk, Tony Ramsay and Catherine Stedman. The series opening theme, \\"Always & Forever\\", was performed by Kylie Minogue. At first, the series rated well, even drawing comparisons to series such as Twin Peaks. However, as the series storylines became more bizarre and complex, it began to rate poorly, only gaining a small, cult fanbase, and was pushed to a later timeslot due to the lack of mainstream interest. Subsequently, little more than six months after the series premiered, filming wrapped on 17 May 2002, and the series was later axed by station executives, who cited low ratings as the principal reason. The final episode aired on screen on 5 June 2003. Synopsis The series begins on the sixteenth birthday of best friends Jane Harper and Della Wells, who live in the same street in Greenwich. However, before the day is over, Jane has disappeared. Over the next year, the lives of six families in the street become further intertwined as a tangled web of secrets and lies threaten to boil to the surface, and Jane's disappearance continues to have a devastating effect. The series combined typical soap opera plots, including babies switched at birth and clandestine affairs, with more unusual stories including murders at the catacombs, and an episode in which a mysterious stranger came to the street and stopped time to uncover the truth about the residents, only to eventually erase their memories of events of that alternative reality and turn everything back to normal. Despite the series being axed, the decision was made long before the final episode was set to air allowing the producers to script an ending to the series. As the series comes to a close, Sam ‚Äì wandering away from home ‚Äì finds Jane working as a geisha, with no memory of who she was. He returned her to her family, and her return ‚Äì coming on the heels of the year anniversary of her disappearance ‚Äì only served to increase tensions and bring secrets into the open. The final episode, the eightieth when counting only the hour-long episodes, focused on revealing some of the secrets behind the characters and Jane being arrested for murder. The episode then flashed forward to four years later and looked at one day in the very different lives of the residents of Greenwich, as Jane was seemingly released from prison and came to discover what had happened since. However, Natalie later learns that Jane was not released, and had in fact died in her cell that morning, and that the presence was in fact her ghost. The final episode closed with a montage of moments from the series to Bj√∂rk's All is Full of Love. Broadcast The series premiered with an unusual format: three thirty-minute episodes would air each week in a teatime slot, before being merged into one, single hour-long late-night \\"omnibus\\" episode, which aired on Thursdays, often containing additional explicit scenes (such as discussion or events that could not be aired in an earlier timeslot). The first thirty-minute episode attracted 2.2 million viewers, airing at 17:05 on 6 November 2001. Across the next few months, the series averaged 1.4 million viewers in this timeslot. However, on 27 March 2002, ITV announced it was removing the series from the teatime slot the following week. This was in response to the series' viewing figures rapidly declining, attracting only a 9% audience share and being beaten in the ratings by BBC Two's The Weakest Link and Channel 4's Richard & Judy. The series' removal was so sudden that TV listings for the next week still advertised it. Speaking of the decision to axe the teatime episodes, Tony Woods, then head of continuing drama at ITV, stated that \\"The series has already established itself as cult viewing for young adults, and re- positioning it with a debut broadcast in the evening will build on its appeal\\". The series continued to air the hour long episodes in a later time slot, with some episodes airing as late as 2AM. Most episodes also aired later than billed, some almost ten minutes behind the advertised schedule. The vacant teatime slot was filled by repeats of game shows such as Catchphrase, You've Been Framed and Family Fortunes. Eventually, in January 2003, a relaunched version of Crossroads aired in the slot, before it too was also cancelled after only a few months on air. The final hour long 'omnibus' episode aired on 5 June 2003 and attracted 500,000 viewers, despite airing at 00:30. In Australia, the series screened on ABC TV. It originally aired at 6pm on weeknights, as a lead into the evening news, but the later episodes were predominantly screened very late at night, in a similar fashion to the UK broadcast; although these retained the thirty-minute format. Production The series was first unveiled by ITV executives on 27 April 2001, before the leading cast were announced on 9 May. The series was commissioned in the wake of ITV losing Home and Away to Channel 5. The series eventually premiered in November 2001 after production delays halted filming and meant that the original premiere date was pushed back. 'Thornton Street' was in reality King George Street SE10, one of the most historic areas of Greenwich. Other locations in Greenwich included the Cutty Sark pub, the Old Greenwich Hospital and Greenwich Park. 'St Vincents Halfway House' was actually in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Interior shots were filmed at the Three Mills Studios in Bow. Night and Day was nominated for ten awards at the British Soap Awards 2002, beating established rivals such as Hollyoaks and Emmerdale. It won one award, 'Hero of the year' (chosen by a panel of judges) for the character of Sam giving up football to look after his orphaned siblings. Filming had finished the day before the British Soap Awards. Some five weeks before the final episode aired in 2003 many TV guides flagged up the weeks episode as the 'last in series'. Indeed, the Radio Times even printed a double page feature about the shows demise after 17 months on air. Quite why this error could have happened is unknown. This led to some fans thinking the series had ended on a knife-edge cliffhanger when in fact the next five weeks tied up all the loose ends to all plots. In 2006, the Radio Times ran a small article about the fifth anniversary of Night and Day's premiere. The programme was described as being stylish but with little substance. The series was never released on DVD or video. The sheer number of songs used on the soundtrack throughout the series would make a DVD release financially impractical as each artist would need to be paid a royalty fee. At the time of the shows final transmission rumours circulated on fan message boards of a clause in the production contract that prevents a rerun of the series until five years after its initial transmission. This has not been confirmed by ITV or LWT. As of , more than fifteen years since the final episode, the series has yet to being repeated.

Description As early as the 16th century, brewers in Bavaria would collect the barrels of beer near the end of the brewing season and stock them in specially developed cellars for the summer. By the 18th century, brewers discovered they could make a greater profit if they opened their garden-topped cellars to the public and served the beer on site.Beer Garden Design: Creating Social Hotspots by Aaron Rzeznik In the 20th century, the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller had both a cellar and a beer garden, as well as the grand hall for indoor functions.After the Battle: It Happened Here: http://www.mythoselser.de/texts/afterthebattle.pdf The grand hall was a rectangular space accommodating up to 3,000 people, though less in full dining mode. Freestanding pillars on either side of the hall supported narrow galleries and the roof. The load-bearing walls and the internal pillars with classical capitals were plastered brickwork. A decorative plastered ceiling, divided into bays with three rows of chandeliers, concealed steel beams supporting the timber roof structure.

There, on 8 November 1923, Adolf Hitler launched the Beer Hall Putsch. After Hitler seized power in 1933, he commemorated each anniversary on the night of 8 November with an address to the Alte K√§mpfer (Old Fighters) in the great hall of the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller. The following day, a re-enactment was conducted of the march through the streets of Munich from the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller to K√∂nigsplatz.

During the Allied aerial bombing of Munich, a single bomb hit the hall where the 1939 explosion had taken place, but failed to explode.After the Battle: It Happened Here After World War II When American forces entered Munich on April 30, 1945, the 42nd ‚ÄòRainbow‚Äô Infantry Division found the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller filthy, piled with Nazi Party records, and unused.After the Battle: It Happened Here: http://www.mythoselser.de/texts/afterthebattle.pdf The B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller served as an American Red Cross Club starting in late 1945 and became a Special Services club in September 1947. An average of 1,700 servicemen made use of the various facilities of the club every day. The B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller was one of nine service clubs in the Munich Military Post.US Army in Germany: http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont.htm?http&&&www.usarmygermany.com;/Units/HqUSAREUR/USAREUR_Spc%20Svcs%20Div.htm With the departure of American forces in 1957, the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller was taken over by the Lowenbrau Beer Company, and after partial rebuilding, was reopened as a bierkeller at Christmas, 1958.After the Battle: It Happened Here: http://www.mythoselser.de/texts/afterthebattle.pdf In preparation for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, the city authorities undertook the construction of an underground railway system. The construction of station escalators emerging on Rosenheimerstrasse, next to the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller, required the cellar, which had been used for Nazi Party meetings, to be sealed off. In 1976, the great hall at the rear was still available for large gatherings.After the Battle: It Happened Here: http://www.mythoselser.de/texts/afterthebattle.pdf In the 1970s, it was in use also as a recording studio, Carlos Kleiber's La Traviata being recorded there in 1976. The B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller was demolished in 1979 in a redevelopment programme, as were the nearby M√ºnchner-Kindl-Keller and the Hofbr√§u brewery. On the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller site now stands the GEMA building, the Gasteig Cultural Centre, and the Munich City Hilton Hotel.

Lingyin Temple () is a Buddhist temple of the Chan sect located north-west of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. The temple's name is commonly literally translated as Temple of the Soul's Retreat. It is one of the largest and wealthiest Buddhist temples in China, and contains numerous pagodas and Buddhist grottoes. The monastery is the largest of several temples in the Wulin Mountains (), which also features many grottos and religious rock carvings, the most famous of which is the Feilai Feng (; literally: \\"the peak that flew hither\\"). History Pagoda containing Huili's ashes, at the foot of Feilai Feng. According to tradition, the monastery was founded in 328 AD during the Eastern Jin dynasty (265-420) by an Indian monk, named Huili in Chinese. From its inception, Lingyin was a famous monastery in the Jiangnan region. At its peak under the Wuyue Kingdom (907-978), the temple boasted nine multi-story buildings, 18 pavilions, 72 halls, more than 1300 dormitory rooms, inhabited by more than 3000 monks. Many of the rich Buddhist carvings in the Feilai Feng grottos and surrounding mountains also date from this era. During the later Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), the monastery was regarded as one of the ten most important temples of the Chan sect in the Jiangnan region. However, its prominence has not saved the temple from marauders. It has been rebuilt no less than sixteen times since then. The current buildings are modern restorations of late Qing (1644-1911) buildings. During the Cultural Revolution, the temple and grounds suffered some damage at the hands of Red Guards. However, they escaped large scale destruction partly because of the protection of Premier Zhou Enlai. Today the temple is thriving as a destination for both pilgrims and tourists. It is regarded as one of the wealthiest monasteries in China, and regular pilgrims have included former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Surrounds Entrance to the Feilai Feng Scenic Area, which contains Lingyin, the Feilai Feng grottoes, and other temples. The Wuling Mountains area is a major centre of Chan Buddhism in south-eastern China. A number of smaller temples are also located in the area. Today, Lingyin and the surrounding areas are marketed as the Lingyin-Feilai Feng Scenic Area, with ticketed admission. Visitors enter from a screen wall marked with a four character inscription \\"the Western Heaven is within reach\\" (). Proceeding down the road from the entrance, the visitor first sees Feilai Feng on the left, then Lingyin Hill on the right. The entire scenic area is dotted with historic buildings and artwork, including pagodas, pavilions, bridges, and statues. The largest stone pagoda is located near the entrance. Called Elder Li's Pagoda (), it houses the ashes of Huili. The area is thickly wooded, with some trees labelled as many centuries old. Feilai Feng grottoes Feilai grottoes Rock reliefs at Feilai Feng; the panel at lower left depicts the pilgrims of the Journey to the West Feilai Feng, or \\"the Peak that Flew Hither\\", also commonly translated as \\"Flying Peak\\" (), is located in front of the temple proper. The peak is so-named because it is made of limestone, giving it a craggy appearance very different from the surrounding mountains. Legend holds that the peak was originally from India (with some versions suggesting that it is Vulture Peak), but flew to Hangzhou overnight as a demonstration of the omnipotence of Buddhist law. Many rock reliefs dot the surface of the peak. More are located in various caves and grottoes throughout the peak. Within the main cave, dedicated to the bodhisattva Guanyin, there is a crack in the ceiling of the cave that stretches up to the surface, so that a person standing at a certain position can see a sliver of sunlight. This is known as the \\"one thread of heaven\\" (). Architecture The main axis of Lingyin follows a traditional Song dynasty five-hall Chan sect structure. The main axis stretches up the Lingyin Hill. However, the five-hall axis is a recent recreation. Only the front three halls are a part of the Qing dynasty axis. =Hall of Four Heavenly Kings= Dhritarashtra, the pipa- playing Heavenly King watching for the East and the wind Courtyard in front the main hall bordered with trees Guanyin, a manifestation of the Bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara, with relief screen, at the back of the Grand Hall of the Great Sage The formal entrance of the temple is the Hall of the Four Heavenly Kings. This hall is a double-eaved building. The front of the building carries a plaque (), written by the Kangxi Emperor. The principal statue in this hall is that of the Maitreya Buddha in his manifestation as the cloth bag monk, or the Laughing Buddha. At the back, facing up the hill, is the Skanda Buddha, or Weituo as he is known in Chinese. This statue dates from the Southern Song Dynasty. Being 800 years old this is the oldest and most important statue in the temple. Arranged along the left and right are the Four Heavenly Kings. The ceiling is ornately painted and decorated with phoenixes and dragons. The statues of Four Heavenly Kings are imposing. Visitors to the temple are often impressed by the size and majesty of the entrance hall and its statues of the heavenly kings. Indeed, the hall of the Heavenly Kings at the Lingyin Temple is as large or larger than the main hall at many temples, reflecting its status as the centre of Buddhism in south-eastern China. The Hall of the Heavenly Kings is the formal entrance to the temple. However, this entry has been closed in recent years, with visitors funneled instead through side doors, where separate ticket offices are set up for admission to the temple. =Mahavira Hall= The second and principal hall is the Mahavira Hall. It is separated from the Hall of the Heavenly Kings by a large courtyard, featuring a raised lawn bordered with trees. To the left of the courtyard stands the Hall of the Five Hundred Arhats. The Grand Hall of the Great Sage is triple eaved and stands 33.6 metres tall. It houses, as is traditional, a statue of Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha. The present statue was carved in 1956 from camphor wood in Tang dynasty style and coated with 60 taels of gold. It is the largest wooden Buddhist statue in China. At the back of the main statue is a statue of Guanyin, backed by a large screen that features the carved images of some 150 Buddhist personalities, including the pilgrims of the Journey to the West, Daoji, and arhats. Arranged along the sides of the hall are images of the 18 principal arhats, and other prominent Buddhists. The interior of the hall reaches about 30 metres, with a gold-painted ceiling featuring bas-relief images of traditional Buddhist symbols. =Hall of Bhaisajyaguru= Further uphill and behind the main hall is the Hall of Bhaisajyaguru (), housing a statue of the Bhaisajyaguru Buddha, commonly called the Medicine Buddha. =Buddhist Texts Library= Uphill from the Hall of the Medicine Buddha is the Buddhist Texts Library. This, and the Huayan Hall behind it, were built from 2000 to 2002 to re-create the five-hall main axis. The Sutra Library does not house a major statue and is not open for worship. =Huayan Hall= The fifth and last hall on the main axis is the Avatamsaka Hall, or Huayan Hall (). Also built in 2002, this hall houses statues of the three sages of the Avatamsaka Sutra, known as the Huayan Sutra in Chinese ‚Äì Shakyamuni, Manjusri, and Samantabhadra. =Hall of the Five Hundred Arhats= The Shakyamuni Buddha statue at the Mahavira Hall. The Hall of Five Hundred Arhats (), also a modern addition, faces onto the western side of the courtyard in front of the main hall. The building has a complex floor plan, shaped like a Buddhist swastika. Along the arms of the swastika are arranged the five hundred arhats as slightly larger-than-life bronze statues. Each statue is seated on a unique ornate seat. At the centre, where the arms of the swastika join, stands a bronze canopy housing statues of four bodhisattvas representing the four cardinal directions. This is currently the tallest solid bronze structure in the world.

The Nazi rank of Helfer was a junior position of the Political Leadership Corps, ranking only above Anw√§rter. A Helfer in the Nazi Party typically served as a junior assistant to a higher official. The rank was created at first to replace the older Nazi rank of Blockleiter; however, a massive expansion of Nazi Party ranks in 1938 assigned the old duties of a Blockleiter to a rank known as Arbeitsleiter. The rank of Helfer then became an assistant position to such higher ranks. The insignia for a Helfer consisted of a brown collar patch with an eagle and swastika, and one or two stripes on the lower portion of the collar tab. A single stripe denoted the rank of Helfer while two stripes denoted the higher position of Oberhelfer. The rank of Helfer was also common in Nazi student groups, typically held by the leader of a local student cell who answered to a local Nazi Party leader. In the film ‚ÄúDie Wei√üe Rose‚Äù, a character known as ‚ÄúStudentenf√ºhrer‚Äù, holds the rank of Helfer. The Nazi rank of Helfer ceased to exist in 1945.

A spin-off of the Jak and Daxter series, Daxter takes place during the 2-year timeskip occurring during the opening cutscene of Jak II; unlike the other installments of the franchise focusing primarily on Jak, the game focuses on the adventures of his sidekick Daxter while Jak is imprisoned. As of September 3, 2019, the game has sold 4.2 million copies, and received generally positive reviews from critics. Gameplay Players assume the role of Daxter in his role as a bug exterminator, while he is searching for his friend Jak throughout the game's story. Daxter can perform double jumping and ledge grabbing, can crouch to squeeze through narrow gaps, make use of trampolines to reach higher ledges and ride on ziplines, and make use of vehicles to move around the game world's map. Portals and gateways are encounted within the main environment which lead to locations containing missions that players must complete in order to advance the story. Combat in the game focuses mainly on melee attacks using an electronic blue eco powered bug-swatter, with players able to perform combo attacks on multiple enemies. After the initial missions, the player gains access to an extermination tank which sprays green eco-based bug spray to stun enemies, with it later able to be upgraded with several new functions, including a jet pack to allow Daxter to fly, a flamethrower modification which can improve the effectiveness of the jet pack, and an ultrasonic attachment that shoots blue eco-based high radial damage projectiles. Damage taken from enemies and certain environmental hazards can be recovered by collecting green eco health packs, while the spray tank's supply can be regenerated by absorbing green eco clusters. Two forms of collectibles can be found during the game, including Golden Bug-Gems, similar to the Metalhead Gems from the second and third installment of the Jak and Daxter series, along with the traditional Precursor Orbs, the latter of which can be used to unlock special features. In addition, players can unlock unique items by breaking picture frames found hidden throughout the game, and with a Jak X game connected to Daxter, can alter the character's goggles and, if the connected save file is 100% complete, a modified Hover Scooter paint scheme. =Dream sequences= During the course of the game, Daxter can unlock \\"Dream Sequences\\", a series of five bonus games located in a bedroom behind Osmo's shop and unlocked by collecting Precursor Orbs.

These bugs can be enhanced by collecting combat bug tokens or potions which are found hidden throughout the levels. The Combat Bug mini-game is not part of the game campaign and is accessed through the game start menu. Plot The game takes place in the final months of the 2-year gap presented in the opening of Jak II (and the aftermath of The Precursor Legacy), between the moment when Jak is taken prisoner by the Krimzon Guard and the time in which Daxter finally rescues him from the Krimzon Guard Fortress. The introduction shows Jak being captured, while Daxter manages to escape. Almost two years later (having no luck with rescuing Jak), Daxter has forgotten all about finding his friend. An old man named Osmo, whom Daxter meets, hires Daxter as an exterminator working in various parts of Haven City, and occasionally its environs, to exterminate bug-like Metal Heads referred to in-game as 'Metal Bugs'. During his adventures, Daxter meets a mysterious woman named Taryn who, despite being less than impressed by Daxter's interest in her, occasionally helps him. After completing a number of missions for Osmo, Daxter sees Jak in a Prison Zoomer and attempts to chase after it. After being cornered by some Krimzon Guards (who had noticed Daxter's pursuit), Daxter is rescued by Osmo's son Ximon, who assists him with several more missions including one to Baron Praxis' palace where Daxter steals a map of the Fortress, the prison where Jak is being held. After returning to the extermination shop, an arthropod sidekick that Daxter acquired earlier is killed by Kaeden, a bitter man who seemingly wants to steal Osmo's shop, but, in actuality, is working for Kor, the Metal Head leader. When Daxter tries to stop Kaeden from escaping the shop, Kaeden suddenly blows up the shop with a bomb he placed in the shop earlier. Daxter and Osmo survive, and Daxter promises to stop Kaeden, but only after he rescues Jak. Daxter infiltrates the Fortress and finds Kaeden, who reveals himself to be a giant Metal Bug. Daxter manages to defeat Kaeden, who tries to warn him that Kor is waiting outside for them, and then uses a hover platform to begin searching for Jak within the Fortress, leading into the opening cutscene from Jak II. After this, the game cuts to a point later in the timeline at Daxter's Naughty Ottsel Bar, where he is recounting the story to Jak, Keira, Samos, Tess, and Taryn. Reception and sales Daxter received generally positive reviews from critics. IGN gave it a 9/10 and GameSpot gave it a 9.1/10. It has an 86.2% at GameRankings. As of September 3, 2019, the game has sold 4.23 million copies. Daxter is regarded as one of the PSP's best titles by a number of websites. GamesRadar+ ranked Daxter the 4th best PSP game ever made, calling it ‚Äúan absolute must-play for the PSP enthusiast.‚Äù Kotaku cited it as one of the 12 best PSP games, claiming it's ‚Äúas funny as it is well-tuned.‚Äù Additionally, Digital Trends and TechRadar each listed Daxter among the 10 best PSP games, with the former specifying that ‚ÄúDaxter‚Äôs vibrant colors and subtle details inject the game with a ton of flair.‚Äù References External links * Category:2006 video games Category:3D platform games Category:Interquel video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Jak and Daxter games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:PlayStation Portable-only games Category:Video game prequels Category:Video games set in prison Category:Video game spin-offs ","title":"Daxter (video game)"},{"id":"2136332","text":"Berbice is a region along the Berbice River in Guyana, which was between 1627 and 1815 a colony of the Netherlands. After having been ceded to the United Kingdom in the latter year, it was merged with Essequibo and Demerara to form the colony of British Guiana in 1831. In 1966, British Guiana gained independence as Guyana. After being a hereditary fief in the possession of the Van Peere family, the colony was governed by the Society of Berbice in the second half of the colonial period, akin to the neighbouring colony of Suriname, which was governed by the Society of Suriname. The capital of Berbice was at Fort Nassau until 1790. In that year, the town of New Amsterdam, which grew around Fort Sint Andries, was made the new capital of the colony. History Map of Berbice around 1720. Suriname around 1767. Map of Berbice around 1740. Berbice in 1802. Berbice was settled in 1627 by the businessman Abraham van Peere from Vlissingen, under the suzerainty of the Dutch West India Company. Until 1714, the colony remained the personal possession of Van Peere and his descendants. Little is known about the early years of the colony, other than that it succeeded in repelling an English attack in 1665 in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The colony was a family affair who owned all the plantations on the Berbice River, however they did allow a couple of sugar planters to settle on the Canje River. A dispute arose between the Second Dutch West India Company, which was founded to succeed the First Dutch West India Company that went bankrupt in 1674, and the Van Peere family, because the family wanted the colony as an immortal loan as agreed with the first Company.Dutch National Archive - Inventaris van het archief van de Soci√´teit van Berbice, (1681) 1720-1795 (1800) This was resolved when on 14 September 1678 a charter was signed which established Berbice as a hereditary fief of the Dutch West India Company, in the possession of the Van Peere family. In November 1712, Berbice was briefly occupied by the French under Jacques Cassard, as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. The Van Peere family did not want to pay a ransom to the French to free the colony, and in order to not let the colony cede to the French, the brothers Nicolaas and Hendrik van Hoorn, Arnold Dix, Pieter Schuurmans, and Cornelis van Peere, paid the ransom of ∆í180,000 in cash and ∆í120,000 in sugar and slaves on 24 October 1714, thereby acquiring the colony. =Society of Berbice= In 1720, the five owners of the colony founded the Society of Berbice, akin to the Society of Suriname which governed the neighbouring colony, to raise more capital for the colony. The Society was a public company listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. In the years following, Berbice's economic situation improved, consisting of 12 plantations owned by the society, 93 private plantation along the Berbice River, and 20 plantations along the Canje River. In 1733, 25 to 30 houses were built around Fort Nassau to house the craftsmen. The next year an inn was added. The village was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam). In 1735, a school master was hired to teach the white children. There were medical doctors stationed in New Amsterdam and Fort Nassau, and six local doctors were assigned to the plantations. Epidemics remained a frequent problem in the colony resulting in many deaths. The religion in the colony was Calvinism. In 1735, a minister was installed in Fort Nassau, but after a personal conflict with the governor, he was transferred to Wiruni Creek. Catholics and Jews were not allowed to become planters or have a government function. In 1738, two missionaries of the Moravian Church had been invited by a planter to teach his slaves. They were treated with suspicion, and received several official warnings. In 1757, the missionaries left, and joined the congregation at the village of Pilgerhut founded in 1740 outside the plantation area, where they lived with 300 Arawak. The colony had peace and trade treaties with the local Amerindians. The colony was not to intervene in wars between the tribes, and no Amerindian was allowed to be taken into slavery unless they were sold by the Kalina or the Arawak and captured from the interior of the country. Berbice was supposed to be guarded by 60 soldiers in Fort Nassau, and another 20 to 30 soldiers in other locations. Even when not under attack, wars often caused supply problems. In 1670s, the colony had not been supplied for 17 months, and neutrality as during the Seven Years' War could not prevent supply shortages. =Slave Uprising= The relatively sound economic situation of the colony was dealt a severe blow when a slave uprising broke out under the leadership of Coffy in February 1763. The slaves captured the south of the colony while the whites, who were severely outnumbered, tried to hang on the north. The uprising went on until well into 1764, with Coffy naming himself governor of Berbice. Only with the use of brute force and military aid by neighbouring colonies and the Netherlands was governor Wolfert Simon van Hoogenheim able to finally suppress the uprising, and restore the colony to Dutch rule. The uprising lead to a steep population decline, abandonment and destruction of many plantations, and serious financial problems for the Society. Fort Nassau had been set on fire to prevent it falling into enemy hands. In 1785 the village was abandoned in favour of Fort Sint Andries, situated more downstream, at the confluence of the Canje River. The new village was again named New Amsterdam, and is still known by that name in contemporary Guyana.Cofona.org - From a Glorious past to a Promising Future: A History of New Amsterdam =Capture by Britain and subsequent merging into British Guiana= On 27 February 1781, British forces occupied Berbice and neighbouring Demerara and Essequibo as part of the Fourth Anglo- Dutch War, because 34 out of 93 plantations in Berbice were under British ownership. In January 1782, the colonies were recaptured by the French, who were allied with the Dutch, and who subsequently restored the colonies to Dutch rule with the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The colony was on 22 April 1796 again captured by Britain, however this time without a fight. A deal was struck with the colony: all laws and customs could remain, and the citizens were equal to British citizens. Any government official who swore loyalty to the British crown could remain in function. Abraham van Batenburg decided to remain governor. Many plantation owners from Barbados settled in the colony, doubling the slave population. The British now remained in possession of the colony until 27 March 1802, when Berbice was restored to the Batavian Republic under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens. In 1803, there was a mutiny of soldiers who complained about the rations. They occupied Fort Sint Andries, and raised the Union Jack with a piece of meat on top. The remaining soldiers aided by Suriname and the Amerindians put down the revolt, and executed five soldiers. In September 1803 the British occupied the territory again, this time for good, and once again without a fight. Abraham van Batenburg, who had been exiled to Europe in 1803, returned for his second term as governor. In the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, the colony was formally ceded to the United Kingdom, and with the ratification of this treaty by the Netherlands on 20 November 1815, all Dutch legal claims to the colony were rescinded. The plantations and slaves of the Society of Berbice remained under their ownership, however they had already made a decision to sell their possessions in 1795, and they closed their offices in 1821. In 1812, the colonies of Demerara and Essequibo had been merged into the colony of Demerara-Essequibo. As part of the reforms of the newly acquired colonies on the South American mainland, the British merged Berbice with Demerara-Essequibo on 21 July 1831, forming the new crown colony of British Guiana, now Guyana. In 1838, Berbice was made one of the three counties of Guiana, the other two being Demerara and Essequibo.Regions of Guyana at Statoids.com. Updated 20 June 2011. Retrieved 20 March 2013. In 1958, the county was abolished when Guiana was subdivided into districts. =Legacy= historical Berbice is part of several Guyanese administrative regions and the name is preserved in the regions of East Berbice-Corentyne, Mahaica-Berbice, and Upper Demerara-Berbice.

For example, buyers and sellers are two common types of agents in partial equilibrium models of a single market. The term market participant is also used in United States constitutional law to describe a U.S. State which is acting as a producer or supplier of a marketable good or service. US constitutional law When a state is acting in such a role, it may permissibly discriminate against non-residents. This principle was established by the United States Supreme Court in Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U.S. 429 (1980), in which the Court upheld South Dakota's right to give South Dakota residents preferential treatment in the purchase of cement produced at a cement plant owned and operated by the state. \\"Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others.\\" Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794 (1976). In Reeves, 447 U.S. 429 (1980), the Court relied upon \\"the long recognized right of trader or manufacturer, engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.\\" \\"There are some limits on a state or local government's ability to impose restrictions that reach beyond the immediate parties with which the government transacts business.\\" White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc., 460 U.S. 204 (1983). \\"The limit on the Market Participant Exception is that it allows a State to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant but allows it to go no further. The State may not impose conditions, whether by statute, regulation, or contract, that have a substantial regulatory effect outside of that particular market.\\" South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82 (1984). \\"Downstream restrictions have a greater regulatory effect than do limitations on the immediate transaction. The State may not avail itself of the market- participant doctrine to immunize its downstream regulation of a market it is not actually a participant.\\" Id. The most ubiquitous example of a service offered by the individual states is the operation of public universities. Because the provision of higher education is deemed not to be a fundamental right, the individual states that have universities may charge higher tuition to out-of-state students. By contrast, discriminatory practices in the provision of essential public services, such as welfare, police protection, and primary education, would violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and discriminatory practices when the state is acting as regulator rather than market participant would violate the dormant commerce clause.

With time the foment would spread to most of its American Colonies. The first restraining act, (15 Geo. III c. 10) known variously as the New England Trade And Fisheries Act, the New England Restraining Act, or the Trade Act 1775 (c.10), limited the export and import of any goods to and from only Great Britain, Ireland, and the British West Indies; it also prohibited the New England colonies from fishing in the waters off Newfoundland and most of America's Atlantic coast, without special permissions and documentation, and imposed stiff penalties on both perpetrators and administrators if violations occurred. Previously legal or finessed trade between the colonies themselves or with other nations was prohibited, and enforced by naval blockade, effective July 1, 1775. The second restraining act, (15 Geo. III c. 18) known as the Trade Act 1775 (c.18), similarly limited the export or import of any goods by way of only Great Britain, Ireland, and the British West Indies for most colonies south of New England; it was passed shortly after the first, upon receiving news in April that the colonial's trade boycott had spread widely among other colonies. Only New York, Delaware, North Carolina and Georgia would escape these restraints on trade, but only for a few months. The Restraining Acts were passed one year after the first of the Intolerable Acts had been imposed to show the potential of tighter British sovereignty over Boston, Massachusetts, and threatened the same treatment in other colonies generally. Instead of quieting the populace, these coercive laws had been met with increasing resistance and rising resentment among the colonials. Over this same period the colonies established independent communications, and the First Continental Congress established the colonial's boycott to restrain the import of British goods then the export of colonial products, which caused disruption in British trade and revenues and shortages in the colonies themselves. Additionally, the colonies had established alternative legislatures in defiance of established ones under direct imperial control. The growing defiance caused a mutual scramble for munitions and treasonous acts to obtain them, indicating that more violence was on the horizon. News arriving about the first restraining act, and related actions of the Massachusetts military governor would lead directly to the first military confrontation in the American Revolutionary War.Alan Axelrod, The Real History of the American Revolution: A New Look at the Past, p. 83 With fighting started, any possible reconciliation became moot, and the King would issue his Royal Proclamation of Rebellion in August. In December 1775 Parliament passed the Prohibitory Act prohibiting any trade with all the colonies, and enforcing it with a tighter blockade and more severe penalties; it was a declaration of economic war, with inbound or outbound ships, mariners and cargoes treated as if they \\"were the ships and effects of open enemies ... [to be] so adjudged, deemed, and taken, in all courts.\\" With this drastic change in British tactics, effective January 1, 1776, the two Restraining Acts as well as the Boston Port Act were repealed, \\"whereas the prohibitions and restraints imposed by the said acts will be rendered unnecessary by the provisions of this act.\\"Prohibitory Act, Section 42, A collection of all the statutes now in force, relating to the Customs in Great Britain and the Plantations. Vol.2 (1780) Rebellion proclaimed The province of Massachusetts Bay was in a state of crisis following the passage of the Coercive Acts in 1774. When colonists formed the extra-legal Massachusetts Provincial Congress and began organizing militia units independent of British control, Parliament responded on February 9, 1775, by declaring that Massachusetts was in a state of rebellion.Cogliano, Revolutionary America, 47. The joint resolution of Parliament read, in part: One of the Coercive Acts, the Boston Port Act, had cut off Boston's trade; this blockade was now extended to all of Massachusetts.Cogliano, Revolutionary America, 47‚Äì48. New England Restraining Act The North ministry next turned its attention to New England generally. The New England Restraining Act (short title: New England Trade And Fisheries Act, 15 Geo. III c. 10)This act also has been variously cited as 15 Geo. III c. 31, the Newfoundland Fisheries Act 1775, also known as Palliser's Act, and named for Hugh Palliser. This act was passed later in the same session of Parliament, the 31st act; section 12 of this act closed a documented loophole which had previously allowed immigration to the continent, and made it illegal and punishable by a fine. was the ministry's response to the American colonies' decision to boycott British goods, as embodied in the Continental Association of 1774. It was given royal assent by George III on March 30, 1775. The Act provided that New England's trade be limited to Britain and the British West Indies (trade with other nations was prohibited, effective July 1, 1775). Moreover, New England ships were barred from the North Atlantic fisheries (a measure that pleased British Canadians, but threatened considerable harm to New England's economy), effective July 20, 1775. Restraining Act extended In April 1775, after news was received in London that colonies outside of New England had joined the Continental Association, a second restraining Act was passed to include the colonies of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland and South Carolina. New York, Delaware, North Carolina, and Georgia were not included because the North ministry mistakenly believed that those colonies were opposed to the colonial boycott.

The parish, which includes Warleigh, has a population of 1,759 and extends over . History The ancient charter Codex Diplomaticus Aevi Saxonici describes a manor parish consisting of three tithings or quasi manors: Bathford in the centre, Shockerwick to the north, and Warley [Warleigh] to the south. This corresponds closely to the current boundaries. This manor was known as Forde up until the seventeenth century; the name was derived from the ford that crosses the By Brook, connecting Bathford to neighbouring Bathampton. Near the river crossing is the site of a Roman villa, the hypocaust of which was found about the middle of the seventeenth century. This villa is described in John Aubrey's Monumenta Britannica: The ford from which the village derived its name was connected with the Fosse Way. This is mentioned in a Saxon charter of the tenth century relating to the manor. The Fosse Way stills forms the boundary of the parish. Bathford was part of the hundred of Bath Forum. The old Bathford railway bridge was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as part of the Great Western Railway. A station called Bathford Halt closed in 1965. Near Bathford, on the opposite side of the river, is a large meadow known as Horselands where, according to tradition, the Roman cavalry were exercised. More recently, the area bounded by Ostlings Lane and the Bradford Road (A363) was used to keep the spare horses used to haul the mail coaches up Bathford Hill. They then returned to the field to await the next coach. Some older long-standing residents of Bathford still refer to Ostlings Lane as Horses Lane. Whether the two areas are related is somewhat uncertain. Bathford has been formally twinned with Artannes-sur-Indre in France since October 2005. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography Bathford Bridge The old walled village of Bathford is located on the A363, approximately one kilometre south of the A4. Bathford Bridge is where the A363 crosses the By Brook (aka Box Brook, The Weaver and Withy Brook). The original bridge was built in the thirteenth or fourteenth century to replace the ford which gave the village its name. Bathford extends up one side of the Avonvale Valley. There are several routes up to the valley ridge, which was once the site of active stone quarrying. This ridge offers commanding views of the valley below and also of nearby Solsbury Hill. Landmarks Shockerwick House was built as a country house around 1750 by John Wood the Elder and is now offices and a nursing home. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. Religious sites St Swithun's Church St Swithun's Church, parts of which may date from the twelfth century, is the resting place of Admiral Lord Nelson's sister, Ann. The church has Romanesque origins and the dedication to St. Swithun is thought to have been in 1323 AD. The north aisle and porch were added in 1856, the south aisle and nave in 1870‚Äì72 and the west tower between 1879 and 1880.

Artist: unknown Benkestok (Benkestokk, Benchestoch et cetera) is one of the original noble families of Norway and one of the few to survive the Middle Ages. At the height of its power, the family ruled large estates in B√•huslen (today a part of Sweden), in Western Norway, in Northern Norway, in the Faroe Islands, and in Shetland.  History  The family's progenitor is Tord Benkestok, who lived in Strand in Forsh√§lla, Bohusl√§n, then a part of Norway. He was in the end of the 14th century mentioned in the Church Property Register by √òystein Aslaksson, Bishop of Oslo. The family was married with members of other old families, among others Sm√∏r, Galte and Kane. The legendary ancestral father was Gaut at √Ünes in Hardanger, born circa 1100. He was a lendmann (baron), and his son Jon Gautsson was a lendmann in the service of Magnus Erlingsson. The Benkestok family was allegedly the eighth generation descending patrilineally from Gaut. Jon Tordsson Benkestok was the first known family member to move to Norway's largest and most important city at the time, Bergen. In a document of 1435, he was called Jon √ûordasson Benkiastok when serving as a Judge of Peace.Diplomatarium Norvegicum I p.543 Date: 7 Septbr. 1435. Place: Bergen. ‚ÄòStein Olafsson Jon √ûordasson Benkiastok ok Arne Paalsson loghr√¶to man j Bergen‚Äô (Translation: ‚ÄòStein Olafsson, Jon √ûordasson Benkiastok, and Arne Paalsson jurors of Bergen‚Äô) Trond Tordsson Benkestok of Talg√∏y was in 1444 mentioned as he attended the Council of the Kingdom. On 4 December, he took part in a council meeting in Copenhagen, where a ruling by King Christopher on the right of Hanseatic merchants in Norway was confirmed. At the meeting, only twelve council members were present; five Lords of the Church and seven Lords of the Realm, of which Trond Benkestok was number six and with the title of knight. Trond, then in his late 20s, probably represented the Lord of Bohusl√§n, who was not present at the meeting. In 1472, he was still a knight and mentioned as a Judge of Peace at a court session in Trondheim concerning an inheritance. Later members of the family lived in Ryfylke, where Talg√∏y in Sj√∏rnar√∏yane and Haraldseid at Skjold were their seat farms, as well as at Jordanger in Sogn. A family member moved north to Mel√∏ya Farm in Mel√∏y, Nordland, which marked the beginning of the expansion of the family in Northern Norway. Mel√∏ya, to which Trond Torleivsson Benkestok came and took his seat. Photographer: Commons user Knut In July 1532, King Christian II was arrested and imprisoned in Copenhagen. Trond Torleivsson Benkestok actively supported Johan Kruckow, who wanted Frederik I on the Danish and the Norwegian throne. Trond was later a knight. Claus Bille describes him as the ‚Äòmost respected and wise nobleman north of the mountains‚Äô. Trond was probably a supporter of the Roman Catholicism until the last Catholic archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, in 1537 fled the country. Trond's oldest son, Jon Trondson Benkestok of Mel√∏y (1530-ca. 1593), was a signatory when the Norwegian nobility in 1591 paid homage to King Christian IV at Akershus Castle. He signed the document using a signet ring with the family's arms. Due to Jon Benkestok's marriage to a so- called unfree woman, Birgitte Nilsdotter, their children lost their noble status. Known children were Torolf (‚Ä† 1622; without children), Anders (‚Ä† after 1630; married, no known children), Trond (‚Ä† 1626; had a daughter), Johan (had a daughter), Tord, Christopher (‚Ä† after 1618; had two sons), Niels (‚Ä† after 1599), Anna (‚Ä† after 1599), and Margrethe Benkestok (several descendants). Trond Benkestok had the daughter Ermegaard Benkestok (‚Ä† 1696), who had descendants. Johan Benkestok had the daughter Anna Benkestok, who was married. Christopher Benkestok had presumptively two sons: Jens Christophersen Benkestok (‚Ä† after 1665) and Anders Benkestok (‚Ä† 1672). The two brothers were the last known male members of the family.Brandt, Wilhelmine: Sl√¶gten Benkestok, p. 5f. 1904. Edition of 1985 by Damms Antikvariat, Oslo. The younger Benkestok family was formed by Gunder Amundsen Benkestok and his children. He was a son of Ermegaard Benkestok's daughter Magdalena Jonsdatter.Brandt, pp. 25, 42. Gunder Benkestok arranged in 1753 on a voyage to Copenhagen, where he attempted to receive noble status for his family based on his cognatic descent from the old Benkestoks.Brandt, pp. 303f. However, he did not succeed. Additionally, another cognatic descendant, Jon Gundersen Benkestok, a first cousin of Gunder Benkestok, used this name.Brandt, p. 94.  Name  The origin of the family's name, allegedly meaning ‚Äòtree-trunk seat‚Äô, has not been established. According to a myth, the family's founding father saved the King of Norway from Swedish soldiers by hiding him in a wooden bench, wherefore he was rewarded with noble status, name, and arms.  Coat of arms  The family's coat of arms is divided per pale. The dexter field has on a background Azure a half lily Argent. The sinister field is divided party per bend, where the lower part is Argent and the upper part is Azure. Being reminiscent of a tree trunk, the latter is probably an allusion to the family name.

History alt=Khadi is also known as khaddar Gandhi spinning Gandhi spins by hand while addressing his followers Mohandas Gandhi's bedroom, bed, desk, and spinning wheel in the Sabarmati Ashram Khadi is also known as khaddar. It is usually a rough textured fabric. In India, Khadi refers to handwoven and hand spun cloth. Weavers prefer yarn produced by mills because it is more robust and consistent in quality. The Swadeshi movement of boycotting English products during the first two decades of the twentieth Century was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi and Indian mill owners, who, backed by Nationalist politicians, called for a boycott of foreign cloth. Gandhi argued that the mill owners would deny handloom weavers an opportunity to buy yarn because they would prefer to create a monopoly for their own cloth. However, handspun yarn was of expensive and of poor quality. Thus Mahatma Gandhi started spinning himself and encouraging others to do so. He made it obligatory for all members of the Indian National Congress to spin cotton themselves and to pay their dues in yarn. He further made the chakri (spinning wheel) the symbol of the Nationalist movement. Initially the Indian flag was supposed to have a chakri, not the Ashoka Chakra at its centre. Mahatma Gandhi collected large sums of money to create a grass-roots organisation to encourage handloom weaving. This was called the 'khaddar' or 'Khadi' movement. Under the British Raj Indians were forced to buy expensive clothes, since the British exported the raw materials for cloth to English fabric mills, then re-imported the finished cloth to India.https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Pakistan/P8Ee8RaSlUUC?hl=en&gbpv;=1&dq;=%22british+raj%22+selling+clohth+high+cost&pg;=PA8&printsec;=frontcover The Indian mill owners wanted to monopolise the Indian market themselves. Ever since the American Civil War caused a shortage of American cotton, Britain would buy cotton from India at cheap prices and use the cotton to manufacture cloth. The khadi movement by Gandhi aimed at boycotting foreign cloth. Mahatma Gandhi began promoting the spinning of khadi for rural self-employment and self-reliance (instead of using cloth manufactured industrially in Britain) in the 1920s, thus making khadi an integral part and an icon of the Swadeshi movement. The freedom struggle revolved around the use of khƒÅdƒ´ fabrics and the dumping of foreign-made clothes. When some people complained about the costliness of khadi to Mahatma Gandhi, he started wearing only dhoti though he used wool shawls when it got cold. Some were able to make a reasonable living by using high quality mill yarn and catering to the luxury market. Mahatma Gandhi tried to put an end to this practice. He even threatened to give up khadi altogether if he didn't get his way. However, since the weavers would have starved if they listened to Gandhi, nothing came of this threat. India In 2017, a total of 4,60,000 people were employed in industries making khadi products. Production and sales rose by 31.6% and 33% respectively in 2017 after multi-spindle charkas were introduced to enhance the productivity by replacing the single-spindle charkas. In 2019 it was reported that overall khadi sales in India have risen by 28% in the 5 year period preceding 2018-2019. The revenues from Khadi in the last financial year stood at ‚Çπ3,215 crore and the KVIC has set a target of ‚Çπ5000 crore to be achieved by 2020. Various states have boards and/or cooperative societies for khadi production, promotion, sale and marketing, such as Haryana Khadi and Village Industries Board, Andhra Pradesh State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society, Gujarat State Handloom and Handicrafts Development Corporation Ltd, Jharkhand Silk Textile and Handicraft Development Corporation, and Tamil Nadu Handloom Weavers' Cooperative Society. Additionally, several institutes are involved in research and training in this area, such as Indian Institute of Handloom Technology, Indian Institute of Handloom Technology, Champa and Institute of Handloom and Textile Technology.The Handicrafts and Handlooms Export Corporation of India is focused on popularising khadi overseas. The Rehwa Society is an NGO involved in khadi production. Popular dresses are made using khadi cloth such as dhoti, kurta, and handloom sarees such as Puttapaka Saree, Kotpad Handloom fabrics, Chamba Rumal, Tussar silk etc. Gajam Anjaiah, an Indian master handloom designer and a recipient of the Padma Shri, is known for his innovation and development of tie-dye handloom products along with the Telia Rumal technique of weaving products based on the Ikat process. After Independence, the Government reserved some types of textile production, e.g. towel manufacture for the handloom sector, which resulted in a deskilling of traditional weavers and a boost for the power loom sector. Private Sector enterprises have been able to make handloom weaving somewhat remunerative and the government also continues to promote the use of Khadi through various initiatives. Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that khadi cloth is a movement to help the poor. He further highlighted that the Khadi and Village Industries Commission is a statutory organisation engaged in promoting and developing khadi and village industries. He lauded Gujarat and Rajasthan for being well known for khadi poly, while Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir are well known for woolen khadi. Bangladesh Khadi, also known as \\"khaddar\\" has a long history in Bangladesh. In the 6th century a local variation of Khadi cloth was described by Huen Tsang of China and Marco Polo in the 12th century AD describes a fabric, most probably khadi Muslin in the Bengal region to being as fine as a spider's web. Romans were great aficionados of Bengal khadi Muslin and imported vast amounts of Khadi. The Khadi weaved by the weavers of Comilla during the Mughal period was renowned as a valuable textile with distinctive characteristics. During the years of the Indian self-rule movement and later with the independence of Bangladesh, the spirit of khadi was driven with the winds of change. In 1921, Gandhi came to Chandina Upazila in Comilla to inspire local weavers and consequently a branch of 'Nikhil Bharat Tantubai Samity' was established to self-seed and proliferate the sale of goods to other major cities in India. In the greater Comilla region, weaving centers were developed in Mainamati, Muradnagar, Gauripur and Chandina. In 1942, political activist Suhasini Das pledged to only wear khadi clothing for the rest of her life.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the village is roughly six miles north-north west of Doncaster. The village falls in the Askern Spa Ward of Doncaster MBC. To the north and south is mixed farmland, the A1 runs immediately along the western edge of the village, and to the east Skellow merges with the adjacent village of Carcroft along the B1220. Geography The village derives its name from the River Skell which flows from the nearby village of Skelbrooke, through the locally named 'Five Lanes End' area of Skellow where it joins the Ea Beck, a tributary of the River Don, of which it joins near the former Thorpe Marsh Power Station at Barnby Dun. The village lies on the north side of the east-west Ea Beck valley. To the north-east with access from the village is Burghwallis. Skellow is well served for open public spaces, with a range of small and medium-sized parks scattered through both the modern housing estates to the west and the older former council estates which border Carcroft. Today most of the western half of Skellow is occupied by a patchwork of late 20th century housing estates. History During the English Civil War, Cromwell placed a cannon battery at the village to protect the Great North Road. The mounds for the cannon still remain and the surrounding area of cottages and 15th century inn (now known as the 'Bridge House') remain to this day. On the east bank of the Skell lies old Skellow, a cluster of older houses facing Skellow Hall. The hall was originally built in 1642 and is now in use as a residential care home for the elderly. Godfrey Higgins was the son of the owner of much of the land, known as Skellow Grange, of what is now Skellow village. The church of Saint Michael located in the village is a sister church to the nearby Grade I listed All Saints, Owston. =Coal mining= Further east is a sizeable former council housing estate which is in a generally good state of repair, and a good example of the coal mining related social housing developments typical of southern part of the West Riding in the early to mid-20th century. This area is the heart of the village, containing most of the local amenities including various shops and the local primary school. Several local clubs exist on the sites of former working men's clubs, and the area has an active local nightlife including live music events. Coal mining in the area ceased in the 1980s but some remnants from the industry are visible in the area, including winding wheel relics at Bullcroft. Demographic evidence of the former mining community is also evident in both higher than average levels of unemployment, and a strong sense of community with residents knowing their neighbours and those that live around them.

It is an apex organisation under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, with regard to khadi and village industries within India, which seeks to - \\"plan, promote, facilitate, organise and assist in the establishment and development of khadi and village industries in the rural areas in coordination with other agencies engaged in rural development wherever necessary.\\"http://www.ari.nic.in/RevisedKVICACT2006.pdf - Chapter 2, Functions of the Commission, Page 7 In April 1957, it took over the work of former All India Khadi and Village Industries Board.Act of Parliament (No. 61 of 1956, as amended by act no. 12 of 1987 and Act No.10 of 2006. . Its head office is in Mumbai , whereas its six zonal offices in Delhi, Bhopal, Bangalore, Kolkata, Mumbai and Guwahati. Other than its zonal offices, it has offices in 28 states for the implementation of its various programmes  Important Terms  = Khadi = \\"The livery of freedom\\" ‚Äì Mahatma Gandhi Khadi, (pronounced KhƒÅdƒ´) refers to hand-spun and hand-woven cloth. The raw materials may be cotton, silk, or wool, which are spun into threads on a charkha (a traditional spinning implement). Khadi was launched in 1920 as a political weapon in the Swadeshi movement of Mahatma Gandhi. Khadi is sourced from different parts of India, depending upon its raw materials - While the silk variety is sourced from West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and North Eastern states, the cotton variety comes from Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Khadi poly is spun in Gujarat and Rajasthan while Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir karnataka are known for the woolen variety. There are a wide range of Khadi personal care products manufactured in Uttarakhand Khadi Products - Handmade and Natural = Village Industry = Any Industry that is located within a rural area, where the Fixed Capital Investment per Artisan (weaver) does not exceed Rupees One hundred thousand The Fixed Capital Investment can be changed by the Central Government of India whenever it so requires.  Relevance of Khadi and Village Industries  The common characteristic found in both - Khadi and Village Industries is that they are labour intensive in nature. In the wake of industrialisation, and the mechanisation of almost all processes, Khadi and Village industries are suited like no other to a labour surplus country like India. Another advantage of Khadi and Village Industries is that they require little or no capital to set up, thereby making them an economically viable option for the rural poor. This is an important point with reference to India in view of its stark income, regional and rural/urban inequalities.  Objectives of the Commission  The Commission has three main objectivesOverview KVIC website which guide its functioning. These are - *The Social Objective - Providing employment in rural areas *The Economic Objective - Providing saleable articles *The Wider Objective - Creating self-reliance amongst people and building up a strong rural community spirit. The commission seeks to achieve these objectives by implementing and monitoring various schemes and programs.  Implementation of Schemes and Programs  The process of Implementation of schemes and programs starts at the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises which is the administrative head of the programs. The Ministry receives funds from the Central Government of India, and routes these to the Khadi and Village Industries Commission for the implementation of programs and schemes related to Khadi and Village Industries.\\\\- Budgetary Support to KVIC, Page 6 Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. The Khadi and Village Industries Commission then uses these funds to implement its programs either directly - Through its 29Page - 65 Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises state offices, by directly funding Khadi and Village institutions and co-operatives, or indirectly through 33Page - 66 Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Khadi and Village Industries Boards, which are statutory bodies formed by the state governments within India, set up for the purpose of promoting Khadi and Village Industries in their respective states. The Khadi and Village Industries Boards, in turn, fund Khadi and Village Institutions/Co-operatives/Entrepreneurs. At present the developmental programmes of the commission are executed through, 5600 registered institutions, 30,138 Cooperative societiesAbout us - Delhi Khadhi and Village industries Board Government of Delhi. and about 9485,000 people. \\\\- Page 67 Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.  Schemes and Programs of the Commission  = Prime Ministers Employment Generation Program (PMEGP) = The Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) the result of the merger of two schemes - Prime Minister's Rojgar Yojana (PMRY) and The Rural Employment Generation Programme (REGP). Rural beneficiaries receive up to a 25% margin compensation in rural areas and 15% in urban areas for the general category and 35% in rural areas and 25% in urban areas for SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women among other special categories. = Interest Subsidy Eligibility Certification Scheme (ISEC) = The Interest Subsidy Eligibility Certificate (ISEC) Scheme is the major source of funding for the Khadi programme. It was introduced in May 1977 to mobilise funds from banking institutions to fill the gap in the actual fund requirement and its availability from budgetary sources. Under this scheme, loans https://www.geekhindi.com/pmegp-loan-detailed-guide-in-hindi/ pmegp loan are provided by the banks to the members to meet their working/fixed capital requirements. These loans are provided at a concessional interest rate of 4% p.a. The difference between the actual interest rate and the concessional rate is borne by the commission under the 'grants' head of its budget. However, only members producing Khadi or Polyvastra (a type of Khadi) are eligible for this scheme. = Rebate Scheme = The rebate on sales of Khadi and Khadi products is made available by the Government so as to make the price of Khadi and Khadi products competitive with other textiles. Normal rebate (10 per cent) all through the year and an additional special rebate (10 per cent) for 108 days in a year, is given to the customers.All figures from - Page 71 The rebate is allowed only on the sales made by the institutions/centers run by the Commission/State Boards and also at the sales centers run by the registered institutions which are engaged in the production of Khadi and polyvastra. Recently, the finance ministry has asked the micro, small and medium enterprises ministry to redraw its rebate scheme for Khadi and village industries. Its view is that the \\"ministry should approach the plan commission and not seek year-to-year extension of the scheme. Furthermore, it has asked the MSME ministry to redesign the scheme in a manner that it should benefit the artisan and not the seller, which (has been) the case so far\\" With regard to this, A proposal received from the Commission for introducing Market Development Assistance as a possible alternative to Rebate on Sale is being considered by the Government.MSME Ministry asked to redraw rebate scheme Indian Express.  Budgetary Support to the Commission  The Union Government through the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, provides funds to the Commission under two heads: Plan and Non ‚Äì Plan. The funds provided under the 'Plan' Head are allocated by the commission to its implementing agencies. The funds provided under the 'Non ‚Äì Plan' head are mainly for the Commission's administrative expenditure.

It was composed by Walter Schumann for the radio show, and was also used on the subsequent television series and later syndication of the TV series under the name \\"Badge 714\\". The theme is in two parts: an opening signature \\"Main Title\\" (the ominous \\"Dum - - - de - DUM - DUM\\") and the \\"Dragnet March\\" used over the end credits. Popular chart hit versions were recorded by Ray Anthony and his Orchestra (1953) and The Art of Noise (1987). Film and television composer Nathan Scott, who began orchestrating for Schumann beginning in 1952, later became Dragnet's second composer following Schumann's departure from the series.  Songwriting controversy  After the theme became a chart hit, the publishers of the score for the 1946 film version of The Killers composed by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa challenged the authorship of the copyright of the Dragnet \\"Main Title\\". They contended that Walter Schumann had visited the sound stage in 1946 when Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa was recording \\"The Killers\\", and so had picked up (perhaps subconsciously) the melody of a cue for that film known as \\"Danger Ahead\\". A settlement between publishers resolved the case by allowing both composers and publishers to share the royalties for the short opening signature \\"Main Title\\", which became known as \\"Danger Ahead\\" after that. The \\"Dragnet March\\" remained the exclusive composition of Schumann. Ray Anthony version The 1953 recording by Ray Anthony and his Orchestra sold over 500,000 copies in the US and rocketed Ray Anthony to popularity. It was available as both a 45rpm 7-inch vinyl record and a 78rpm 10-inch shellac record. It reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent two weeks in the UK chart (December 10, 1953 and January 14, 1954), peaking at number seven. The Art of Noise version The 1987 version by The Art of Noise was an international hit, and won the 1987 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. It was used as the theme music for the 1987 film version of Dragnet based on the TV show. A new version was released the following year, \\"Dragnet (The '88 Mix)\\". =Reception= Evan Cater for AllMusic describes the 12-inch single as \\"a catchy mesh of orchestral samples, synthesized noise and clips of dialogue from the film.\\" =Chart performance= The Art of Noise version reached number 60 in the UK, number 84 in the Netherlands, number 25 in New Zealand and number 29 in Switzerland. \\"Dragnet (The '88 Mix)\\" reached number 90 in the UK. Other uses of the theme A parody of the theme opened the 1967 Eric Burdon and The Animals hit \\"San Franciscan Nights\\". A sample of it was used in the 1973 song \\"Armed and Extremely Dangerous\\" by First Choice. The opening signature was used in the theme song for the 1987 TV series Simon and the Witch. The 2003 Dick Wolf- produced version of Dragnet used a modified version of the \\"Danger Ahead\\" theme composed by Mike Post. The opening signature is frequently played during NHL hockey games by the home team (Detroit is one example) whenever a member of the opposing team has drawn a penalty.

The early membership was composed mostly of Punjabi Indians who lived and worked on the West Coast of the United States and Canada, but the movement later spread to India and Indian diasporic communities around the world. The official founding has been dated to a meeting on 15 July 1913 in Astoria, Oregon, with the Ghadar headquarters and Hindustan Ghadar newspaper based in San Francisco, California. Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, some Ghadar party members returned to Punjab to incite armed revolution for Indian Independence. Ghadarites smuggled arms into India and incited Indian troops to mutiny against the British. This uprising, known as the Ghadar Mutiny, was unsuccessful, and 42 mutineers were executed following the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial. From 1914 to 1917 Ghadarites continued underground anti-colonial actions with the support of Germany and Ottoman Turkey, known as the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy, which led to a sensational trial in San Francisco in 1917. Following the war's conclusion, the party in the United States fractured into a Communist and an Indian Socialist faction. The party was formally dissolved in 1948. Key participants in the Ghadar Movement included Bhai Parmanand, Vishnu Ganesh Pingle, Sohan Singh Bhakna, Bhagwan Singh Gyanee, Har Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Bhagat Singh Thind, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Abdul Hafiz Mohamed Barakatullah, Rashbehari Bose, and Gulab Kaur. Although its attempts at overthrowing the British Raj were unsuccessful, the insurrectionary ideals of the Ghadar Party influenced members of the Indian Independence Movement opposed to Gandhian nonviolence.  Etymology  Ghadar is an Urdu word derived from Arabic which means \\"revolt\\" or \\"rebellion.\\" It is often also spelled Ghadr or Gadar in English. The movement's name was closely associated with its newspaper, the Hindustan Ghadar. Background Between 1903 and 1913 approximately 10,000 South Asians emigres entered North America, mostly from the rural regions of central Punjab. About half the Punjabis had served in the British military. The Canadian government decided to curtail this influx with a series of laws, which were aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into the country and restricting the political rights of those already in the country. Many migrants came to work in the fields, factories, and logging camps of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, where they were exposed to labor unions and the ideas of the radical Industrial Workers of the World or IWW. The migrants of the Pacific Northwest banded together in Sikh gurdwaras and formed political Hindustani Associations for mutual aid. Nationalist sentiments were also building around the world among South Asian emigres and students, where they could organize more freely than in British India. Several dozen students came to study at the University of Berkeley, some spurred by a scholarship offered by a wealthy Punjabi farmer. Revolutionary intellectuals like Har Dayal and Taraknath Das attempted to organize students and educate them in anarchist and nationalist ideas. RasBihari Bose on request from Vishnu Ganesh Pingle, an American trained Ghadar, who met Bose at Benares and requested him to take up the leadership of the coming revolution. But before accepting the responsibility, he sent Sachin Sanyal to the Punjab to assess the situation. Sachin returned very optimistic, in the United States and Canada with the aim to liberate India from British rule. The movement began with a group of immigrants known as the Hindustani Workers of the Pacific Coast. Ghadar di Gunj, an early Ghadarite compilation of nationalist and socialist literature, was banned in India in 1913. The Ghadar Party, initially the Pacific Coast Hindustan Association, was formed on 15 July 1913 in the United States but before a decision to create headquarter at Yugantar Ashram in San Francisco was taken at a meeting in the town of Astoria in the state of Oregon in USA under the leadership of Har Dayal, Sant Baba Wasakha Singh Dadehar, Baba Jawala Singh, Santokh Singh and Sohan Singh Bhaknaas its president. The members of the party were Indian immigrants, largely from Punjab. Many of its members were students at University of California at Berkeley including Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Maulavi Barkatullah, Harnam Singh Tundilat, Kartar Singh Sarabha and V.G. Pingle. The party quickly gained support from Indian expatriates, especially in the United States, Canada, East Africa, and Asia.  Newspaper  Ghadar Newspaper (Urdu) Vol. 1, No. 22, March 24, 1914 The party was built around the weekly paper The Ghadar, which carried the caption on the masthead: Angrezi Raj Ka Dushman (an enemy of the British rule). \\"Wanted brave soldiers\\", the Ghadar declared, \\"to stir up rebellion in India. Pay-death; Price-martyrdom; Pension-liberty; Field of battle-India\\". The ideology of the party was strongly secular. In the words of Sohan Singh Bhakna, who later became a major peasant leader of Punjab: \\"We were not Sikhs or Punjabis. Our religion was patriotism\\". The first issue of The Ghadar, was published in San Francisco on November 1, 1913. As Kartar Singh Sarabha, one of the founders of the party, wrote in the first issue: \\"Today there begins 'Ghadar' in foreign lands, but in our country's tongue, a war against the British Raj. What is our name? Ghadar. What is our work? Ghadar. Where will be the Revolution? In India. The time will soon come when rifles and blood will take the place of pens and ink.\\" Following the voyage of the Komagata Maru in 1914, a direct challenge to Canadian anti-Indian immigration laws, several thousand Indians resident in the United States sold their business and homes ready to drive the British from India. However, Har Dayal had fled to Europe concerned that the U.S. authorities would hand him over to the British. Sohan Singh Bhakna was already in British hands, and the leadership fell to Ram Chandra. Following the entry of Canada into World War I, the organisation was centred in the USA and received substantial funding from the German government. They had a very militant tone, as illustrated by this quote from Harnam Singh: :No pundits or mullahs do we need The party rose to prominence in the second decade of the 20th century, and grew in strength owing to Indian discontent over World War I and the lack of political reforms. In 1917 some of their leaders were arrested and put on trial in the Hindu German Conspiracy Trial in which their paper was quoted. In 1914, Kasi Ram Joshi a member of the party from Haryana, returned to India from America. On 15 March 1915 he was hanged by the colonial government.Haryana Samvad , Jan 2018. The Ghadar party commanded a loyal following the province of Punjab, but many of its most prominent activists were forced into exile to Canada and the United States. It ceased to play an active role in Indian politics after. Periodical Independent Hindustan Although publication such as independence Hindustan and revolution activities of Ghadar Party against British rule continued from 5 wood street San Francisco, place where Ghadar Memorial has been built but Har Dayal one among its founding members severed all connections with revolutionists by its open letter published in March 1919 in Indian newspapers and new Statesman USA, and by writing to British Goveronment for obtaining Amnesty for himself. The party had active members in other countries such as Mexico, Japan, China, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaya, Indo-China and Eastern and Southern Africa.

The MVDDS system uses similar spectrum to a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) system, and is capable of operating at the same frequencies without interference. The MDSA two-way system competes against satellite Internet access; the shorter round trip distance of only a few hundred kilometers reduces the latency compared with a geostationary satellite's 44,000 mile 250ms latency. The MDSA system has the disadvantage of requiring infrastructure closer to the user - a satellite can cover a significant proportion of the country, instead of the maximum 200 km radius of an MDSA base station. However, since the MDSA signal can be sectorized, MDSA's bandwidth, unlike that of satellite, can be multiplied in most geographical areas. For video distribution, this means that local channels and local advertising can be injected into the signal, unlike with DBS satellite systems. MDS America Inc. (MDSA) built the first Terrestrial Digital Television distribution system in Ireland. As well MDS America has built the largest MVDDS systems in the world, including the 700 channel capacity system in the United Arab Emirates.

J√ºrgen Wullenwever (c. 1492 - 29 September 1537) was burgomaster of L√ºbeck from 1533 to 1535, a period of religious, political and trade turmoil. Biography Wullenwever was probably born at Hamburg in 1492. Settling in L√ºbeck as a merchant he took some part in the risings of the inhabitants in 1530 and 1531, being strongly in sympathy with the democratic ideas in religion and politics which inspired them. Having joined the governing council of the city and become leader of the democratic party, he was appointed burgomaster early in 1533 and threw himself into the movement for restoring L√ºbeck to her former position of influence. Preparations were made to attack the Dutch towns, the principal trading rivals of L√ºbeck, when the death of Frederick I, king of Denmark, in April 1533 changed the position of affairs. The L√ºbeckers objected to the bestowal of the Danish crown upon any prince favorable to the Empire or the Roman Catholic religion, and Wullenwever went to Copenhagen to discuss the matter. At length an alliance was concluded with Henry VIII of England; considerable support was obtained in North Germany; and in 1534 an attack was made on Christian, Duke of Holstein, afterwards King Christian III, who claimed the throne - involving L√ºbeck in the Danish civil war known as the Count's Feud. At first the L√ºbeckers gained several successes, but Christian of Holstein appeared before L√ºbeck; the efforts of Wullenwever to secure allies failed; and the citizens were compelled to make peace. The imperial court of justice at Speyer restored the old constitution, and in August 1535 the aristocratic party returned to power. Soon afterwards Wullenwever was seized by Christopher of Brunswick- L√ºneburg, archbishop of Bremen, and handed over to his brother Henry II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. Having been tortured and sentenced to death as a traitor and an Anabaptist, he was beheaded at Wolfenb√ºttel. Legacy Wullenwever, who was long regarded as a popular hero in L√ºbeck, inspired tragedies by Heinrich Kruse and Karl Ferdinand Gutzkow, and a novel by Ludwig K√∂hler. The biography of Ann Boleyn written by Jean Bruller (\\"Vercors\\") describes in considerable detail the course of Henry VIII's alliance with Wullenwever, concluded at the time when Ann Boleyn was Queen and involved herself in the running of England's foreign policy.

Halu≈°ky can refer to the dumplings themselves, or to the complete dish. Halu≈°ky is Ukrainian national dish. Bryndzov√© halu≈°ky is the national dish of Slovakia. Preparation Halu≈°ky dumplings are made from a batter consisting of flour and grated potatoes. The batter is spread on a wooden cutting board, from which small pieces of the batter are dropped into boiling water. They can also be made with a special perforated cooking strainer (halu≈°kar) from which the batter is dropped directly into the boiling water through small holes in the halu≈°kar. Although recipes vary from region to region, in general flour is mixed with grated potatoes to form the batter. Salt and sometimes an egg are added, but bryndzov√© halu≈°ky, the national dish of Slovakia, usually does not include eggs. After cooking, the Halu≈°ky are mixed with various ingredients, such as bryndza (a special cheese made mostly from sheep milk), bacon, and bacon fat. In some parts of Slovakia, caramelized butter and cabbage, onions, or combinations of these items are used instead of bryndza. Variations Bryndzov√© halu≈°ky is a traditional Slovak dish also found in Moravia in the eastern part of the Czech Republic. Kapustov√© halu≈°ky is a similar dish that's made with fried cabbage (and/or onions) and caramelized butter instead of bryndza. Strapaƒçky is another variation of halu≈°ky in which stewed sauerkraut is used instead of bryndza. In Hungary, galuska are often eaten with meat stews, such as goulash or p√∂rk√∂lt. In the United States, most adapted halusky recipes call for egg noodles rather than potato dumplings. Some American cooks include loose, cut, and fried green cabbage (a convergence with strapaƒçky, compelled by simplicity, difficulty in finding bryndza or acceptable substitutes, and access to affordable cabbage in areas with prominent existing Slavic and Germanic immigration).

One of Frederick's trusted confidantes and advisors, he attracted enmity from other courtiers. Frederick entrusted him with considerable autonomy on the general staff, and Winterfeldt developed the first \\"modern\\" program of military intelligence gathering. He negotiated the Convention of Westminster and, for his efforts on Frederick's behalf, received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le M√©rite. He died from wounds received at Battle of Moys. His name is included on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great. Early life Hans Karl von Winterfeldt was born at Vanselow Castle (now in Siedenbr√ºnzow, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) in Swedish Pomerania. His education was imperfect, and in later life he always regretted his lack of familiarity with the French language.Hugh Chisholm, ed. (1911). \\"Winterfeldt, Hans Karl von\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 28 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. Military career Winterfeldt entered the cuirassier regiment of his uncle, Major General von Winterfeld, where he served until 1720; he was promoted cornet ( after two years service. He was fortunate enough, by his stature and soldierly bearing, to attract the notice of Frederick William I, who transferred him to the so-called giant regiment of grenadiers as a lieutenant. Before long he became a personal aide-de-camp to the king, and in 1732 he was sent with a party of selected non-commissioned officers to assist in the organization of the Russian army. While the guest of the Count Marshal Munnich at St. Petersburg, Winterfeldt fell in love with, and married, his cousin Julie von Maltzahn, who was also the marshal's stepdaughter and a lady in waiting to the grand duchess Elizabeth of Russia. On returning to Prussia he became an intimate of the crown prince, afterwards Frederick the Great, whom he later accompanied in the Rhine campaign of 1734. This intimacy, in view of his personal relations with the king, made Winterfeldt's position very difficult, for Frederick William and his son were badly estranged over the Katte Affair; eventually the prince was brought before a court-martial by his father, on the charge of attempting to desert, and was condemned to death. Winterfeldt remained the prince's constant friend through all these troubles, and on Frederick II's accession, he was promoted to major and appointed aide-de-camp to the new sovereign. =Activities during War of the Austrian Succession= When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt was sent on a mission to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed. He then commanded a grenadier battalion with great distinction at the Battle of Mollwitz, and won further glory in the celebrated minor combat of Rothschloss, where the Prussian hussars defeated the Austrians on 17 May 1741. One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, as the older in years and service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a position in which Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, and as a matter of course made many enemies. Winterfeldt was the King's confidente in reforming the army, recreating the general staff, and developing military intelligence.Giles MacDonogh, Frederick the Great, a Life in Deed and Letters, St. Martin's Press, 2013, p. 224. In the short peace, he was in constant attendance upon the king, who employed him again, when the war was resumed, in the same capacity as before, and, after he had been instrumental in winning a series of successful minor engagements. was promoted to major general in 1745, with effect from January 1743. For his great services at Hohenfriedberg, Frederick gave him the captaincy of Tatiau, which carried with it a salary of 500 thalers a year. Later on he became Governor of Kolberg in Pomerania. At Battle of Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the united Austro-Saxon force; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in time to take a decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share the laurels, and Zieten wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt in any way that he thought fit. During the ten years peace that preceded the next great war, Winterfeldt was in constant attendance upon the king, except when employed on confidential missions in the provinces or abroad. For example, he was sent to London for negotiating the Convention of Westminster. In 1756 he was made a lieutenant general and received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le M√©rite. Hans Carl von Winterfeld ‚Äì Relief at his tomb in the Invalidenfriedhof Berlin Grave of Hans Karl von Winterfeldt (1757) on the Invalidenfriedhof Berlin Seven Years' War The 1745 Treaty of Dresden, which concluded Prussia's war with Austria, gave Prussia control of Silesia. Frederick understood that Maria Theresa would seek to regain the territory she had lost when she had a chance. Winterfeldt was active in collecting information about the coalition that was secretly preparing to strike Prussia. In preparing for the upcoming war, Winterfeldt took a leading part in the discussions which eventuated in Frederick's decision to strike the first blow.Marcus von Salisch, Treue Deserteure: Das kurs√§chsische Milit√§r und der Siebenj√§hrige Krieg, Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2008, p.55. Winterfeldt was at Pirna with the king; when the Saxons surrendered there, Frederick considered incorporating the Saxon army wholesale into his own, and Winterfeldt advised him against this act. Frederick did it anyway. He accompanied Schwerin in the advance on Prague in 1757 and took a conspicuous part in the battle there, where the Saxon army deserted the Prussians by regiment. After the defeat of Kolin, however, Winterfeldt, whom Frederick seems to have regarded as the only man of character whom he could trust to conduct the more delicate and difficult operations of the retreat, found himself obliged to work in close contact with the king's brother, Prince William, Zieten and others of the men who considered him their enemies. The operations which followed may be summarized by the phrase everything went wrong; after an angry scene with his brother, Prince William retired from the army, and when Frederick gave Winterfeldt renewed marks of his confidence, the general animosity reached its height. As it chanced, however, Winterfeldt fell a victim to his own bravery in a skirmish at Moys near G√∂rlitz on 7 September. His wound proved fatal and he died on 8 September. The court enmities provoked by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed the bitterness of his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, and as for the rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically. Initially, Winterfeldt was buried at his estate of Barschau; a hundred years later, his body was transferred to the Invalidenfriedhof (military cemetery) at Berlin. A statue, which stands on the Wilhelmplatz there, was erected to his memory, and another was erected in the Bodemuseum on the Museumsinsel. Another forms part of the memorial to Frederick the Great at the boulevard Unter den Linden. In 1851 his name was inscribed on Frederick the Great's Equestrian Statue.Denkmal K√∂nig Friedrichs des Grossen: enth√ºllt am 31.

G.\\" Jones (12 October 1917 ‚Äì 3 January 2004) was a Welsh footballer most notable for his career with Everton and Wales. Biography Born in Queensferry and raised in Connah's Quay, Tommy (T.G.) Jones started his professional career with Wrexham. He signed for Everton for ¬£3,000 in 1936. He won a Football League First Division champions medal in only his second full season at Everton in 1938-39, before his career was interrupted by the Second World War. Jones served as a sergeant PT Instructor in the RAF during the war, but he resumed his career for Everton in 1946. A.S. Roma successfully bid ¬£15,000 for him, a large sum in those days, but foreign exchange regulations stopped the transfer. After the war Everton transferred Tommy Lawton to Chelsea and Joe Mercer to Arsenal. These deals were not only blows to the Everton team, but to him personally, he had been best man at Joe Mercer's wedding. A club director falsely accused Jones of feigning injury in a wartime match and his senior appearances thereafter were sporadic. Jones's injury was actually severe enough to put him in hospital for four months. Once the relations with the manager Cliff Britton became so bad that he was even not picked for the reserve team, and played secretly for Hawarden Grammar Old Boys. Jones became club captain in 1949 but after falling out of favour, in January 1950, he accepted an offer to leave Everton for Pwllheli. In all he made 178 peacetime appearances for Everton, scoring five goals. Jones won 17 caps for Wales and eleven caps in wartime internationals. After Jones left Everton he played non league football for Pwllheli and became their part-time manager, as well as running a hotel in the town. In 1957 he became manager of Bangor City. In 1962, after winning the Welsh Cup, the team beat Napoli 2‚Äì0 in the home leg in the European Cup Winners Cup but lost 1‚Äì3 in Italy. With no away-goal rule, Bangor lost the replay 3‚Äì1. He ended his managerial career at Rhyl followed by a brief stint as advisor to Bethesda. In later life Jones ran a newsagent's shop in north Wales. He was elected a 'Millennium Giant' by Everton in 2000, one of the first eleven from the club's long history to be so honoured. The panel of assessors described him as an apparently effortless, skilful and assured footballer. He passed the ball from his position at centre-half in the same way that Franz Beckenbauer would do later. He was renowned for his sporting behaviour. Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton, Joe Mercer and Dixie Dean each cited Jones as the greatest player that they ever saw. Former Liverpool star of the same era, Cyril Done, said that \\"T. G. was a gentleman off the field, and a gentleman on the field\\". In addition to his playing career, Tommy was instrumental in re-establishing senior football in his home town after the collapse of Connah's Quay and Shotton United in 1927, just six months after they had won the Welsh Cup and beating the previous season's FA Cup winners Cardiff City in the final. Though junior clubs, notable Connah's Quay Albion played in the town it was not until Tommy's intervention in July 1946 that Connah's Quay Juniors, the fore-runner of the present-day Nomads club was formed. Attracted by the reputation of the famous international, youngsters from Connah's Quay and its surrounding towns and villages flocked to join the new team which quickly became a major force in North Wales youth soccer, winning the Welsh Youth Cup in 1948. By natural progression a senior team was formed and joined the Flintshire League in 1948. Success soon followed and Connah's Quay Juniors reached the final of the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1950/51. Prior to the 1952/53 season, the suffix Nomads was adopted and the team ventured into the Welsh League (North). Personal life His wife Joyce died in 2003. He was survived by his two daughters, Jane and Elizabeth.

Biography He is remembered as the journalist and art critic for the French satirical newspaper Le Charivari, who coined the term \\"impressionists\\" to satirise the artists now known by the word. Leroy's review was printed in Le Charivari on 25 April 1874 with the title The Exhibition of the Impressionists. The term was taken from Claude Monet's painting Impression: soleil levant.

Involved in active politics since 1948, he was one of founders and, for many years, the leader of the Italian Social Movement (MSI). He was the main representative of the MSI's left-wing. Early years Rauti was born in Cardinale, Calabria. As a youth Rauti volunteered for the Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana of the Italian Social Republic before briefly going into exile with the Spanish Foreign Legion. Rauti returned to Italy in 1946 and joined the Italian Social Movement (MSI) two years later.Roger Eatwell, Fascism - A History, 2003, p. 255 He became a leading member of the party and also joined the New European Order initiative.Franco Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy - The Radical Right in Italy After the War, 1996, p. 59 He became associated with Julius Evola and, along with Enzo Erra, served as editor of his journal Imperium.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 210 Such was Rauti's support for Evola's philosophy that his own theoretical writings demonstrated so much of his mentor's influences as to be at times plagiarism.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 218 In 1954 he established his own group within the MSI based around the Imperium group, the Ordine Nuovo. However Rauti became disillusioned with the MSI, particularly after the party supported the presidency bid of Giovanni Gronchi and the premiership of Giuseppe Pella, and so his group split off at the 1956 party conference, with Rauti launching a tirade of abuse at the MSI leadership as he left.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, pp. 52-3 Terrorism allegations Alongside his political career Rauti was also the subject of a series of allegations linking him to the terror campaigns associated with the 'strategy of tension'. A noted anti-communist, Rauti sought to use a twin- track approach against the communists, with both strands calling for violent action. He supported the old tactic of direct street fights with far left militia groups but also endorsed a process of infiltrating these groups and thus provoking them to more action and more direct confrontation with law enforcement. Rauti hoped that his policy would create an atmosphere of civil unrest that he hoped would be more conducive to a neo-fascist takeover.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 86 Rauti's name cropped up in the inquiry into the Piazza Fontana bombingFerraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 225 whilst he had also been named as having attended high-level terrorism planning meetings in Padua in 1969.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 101 The Treviso magistrates brought Rauti to trial in 1972 over possible involvement in the Piazza Fontana attack but ultimately he was acquitted due to a lack of evidence.Stuart Christie, Edward Heath Made Me Angry: The Christie File Part 3, 2004, p. 297 Rauti was aided in this by being able to provide an alibi for the Padua meeting.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 238 Rauti was known to be close to Mario Merlino and by extension was linked to Merlino's close comrade Stefano Delle Chiaie.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 228 He also collaborated with former Ordine Nuovo member Franco Freda, producing a series of pamphlets with him in the 1960s.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 96 Some documents have also claimed that Rauti was either a 'contact' or a paid informer for the head of the Servizio Informazioni Difesa, which was itself linked to the strategy of tension.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 63 It has also been suggested that he was responsible for setting up the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari along with Guido Giannettini.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 239 However, there was never any concrete evidence to link Rauti to terrorism and he was never convicted of any offences. Return to the MSI Rauti with Giorgio Almirante in 1969 Rauti returned to the MSI in 1969 and was given a seat on the Central Committee by Giorgio Almirante. Rauti's move was condemned by Clemente Graziani, who continued to lead a rump Ordine Nuovo outside the MSI although the two men actually remained close associates.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 53 Meanwhile, Rauti was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1972.Eatwell, Fascism, p. 263 Rauti's position within the MSI was strengthened in 1977 when the main moderate faction broke away to form a new party, National Democracy. This opened space for a new Evola-based movement to gain power within the party under Rauti and he placed his emphasis on youth by organising Camp Hobbit, a series of events for young party members that were noted for having a much more casual and fun- oriented vibe than previous party youth initiatives.Piero Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, 2006, p. 40 The event was such a success that afterwards the MSI youth movement, the Fronte della Giovent√π, threw their lot in with Rauti's faction.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 155 Meanwhile, his influence continued to grow when he became a leading figure in the European Parliament during the 1980s. In 1987 Rauti, by then deputy-secretary of the MSI, was one of two candidates seeking to succeed Giorgio Almirante as leader of the MSI, the other being Gianfranco Fini. Continuing to present a policy platform based on the ideas of Evola, Rauti also demonstrated elements of Nouvelle Droite thinking, having been converted to ethnopluralism and support for nationalism in the developing world. Fini however, presenting a more moderate platform, secured the leadership by taking 727 votes to Rauti's 608.Eatwell, Fascism, p. 264 Leadership of MSI Despite his defeat Rauti's position within the party was soon strengthened. Fini looked to the success of Jean-Marie Le Pen and the Front National in France and, seeking to utilise the template they had established, sought to make opposition to immigration the central policy of the MSI. The move provoked alarm as it seemed that Fini was seeking to abandon fascism altogether and instead turn the MSI to populism. This radical departure, combined with some poor electoral showings, led to Rauti replacing Fini as leader in 1990. As leader Rauti sought to underline the party's fascism as being a radical revolutionary creed that, he argued, should not be considered right-wing. He also underlined his opposition to the United States and Western values as well as his support for ethnopluralism.Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, p. 42 However the 3.9% of the vote captured at the 1990 regional elections represented the worst return in MSI history and a further slump in support in local elections in Sicily saw him removed from the leadership in July 1991 and replaced by Fini.Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, p. 43 Fiamma Tricolore Rauti remained a hard-line critic of Fini's leadership until 1995 when Fini declared the dissolution of the MSI and the foundation, in its place, of the Alleanza Nazionale. Seeing this a break from the fascist heritage which he felt was central to the MSI, Rauti led a group of militants to break away and form the Fiamma Tricolore, which he saw as continuing the path of fascism.Robert O. Paxton, The Anatomy of Fascism, 2004, p. 104 Although commentators had expected the party to be a fringe movement it polled surprisingly well in the 1996 election and even managed to capture a seat in the European Parliament in the 1999 election.Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, p. 52 Retirement and comeback Rauti stood down as leader in 2002 in favour of Luca Romagnoli, who immediately adopted a policy of seeking to work with Silvio Berlusconi's House of Freedoms coalition.Il segretario Pino Rauti lascia il posto a Luca Romagnoli Fiamma tricolore: virata verso la Casa delle libert√† Rauti became a strong critic of the direction taken by Romagnoli leading to him being expelled from the party he had founded in early 2004.Il Movimento Sociale Fiamma Tricolore replica alle irresponsabili dichiarazioni di Rauti alla stampa He then established his own party, the Social Idea Movement.MIS Official site Rauti died in Rome, aged 85.

The river formed the boundary between the historic counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire until in 1887, the parishes east of the river, Rumney and St Mellons, were transferred from the jurisdiction of Newport, to Cardiff in Glamorgan. The river runs south from its source near Rhymney through New Tredegar, Bargoed, Ystrad Mynach, Llanbradach to Caerphilly at the southern end of the Rhymney Valley. Then past Bedwas, Trethomas, Machen, Draethen, Llanrumney and Rumney and its estuary into the River Severn. The Rhymney Valley () was created as a glacial valley. Sourced within the valley, on the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons, the Rhymney River descends steeply through the town of New Tredegar towards Ystrad Mynach, and then onwards south across a flat plain before entering the Severn Estuary to the east of Cardiff. The villages of Groesfaen, Deri, Pentwyn and Fochriw are located in the Darran Valley and not the Rhymney Valley, which joins the Rhymney Valley at Bargoed.

The river is culverted in many of its upper sections, including a tunnel under the former factory complexes in Rhymney, exiting at Pontlottyn. Since the closure of the last of the coal mines in the late 1980s, the water has become a lot cleaner and is now full of fish and insect life and supports plenty of other wildlife. The river now supports a healthy stock of grayling and natural brown trout, and a lot of work has been undertaken to remove former industrial restrictions on the river to allow the fish to gain access to its upper reaches. The river is in the care of Natural Resources Wales and the South East Wales Rivers Trust.

Purpose and use A parrot harness may enable a companion parrot to be taken outdoors while restraining it and preventing it from flying away. Some parrots may dislike wearing a harness and bite at it, but parrots that are harness-trained from a very young age may accept them willingly; more often, though, parrots must be very carefully and gradually accustomed and trained to wear a harness. Care must be taken that the parrot does not feel threatened. Properly trained parrots often appear to enjoy wearing their harnesses if they associate them with going outdoors. If the harness is attached to a long leash, the parrot can be given some limited flight outside. However, this can be potentially dangerous for the parrot, which may be initially frightened by unfamiliar events, noises, and objects. It is usually best to first take the parrot out in a cage or carrier to let it become accustomed to being outdoors. Parrot harnesses are available commercially in a range of brands and sizes, fitting small birds such as budgerigars and cockatiels, all the way up to the largest macaws and cockatoos. Some parrot owners may choose to make their own harnesses. Heavy harnesses that require assembly with metal buckles and clips can be uncomfortable. They may be broken or unlatched by some larger birds with strong beaks. A leash should always be fastened securely to the person holding the leash (such as by an elastic band around the wrist) to avoid the possibility of dropping the leash, as a dropped leash may become entangled in a tree or other object if a parrot flies off. A harness should only be used when the parrot is supervised and should never be used to tether a parrot to a perch or other object. The best way to train a parrot to wear a harness is to use positive and negative reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is used to reward the parrot until it overcomes its fear of the harness. Food treats are used as positive reinforcement to reward the parrot for putting on the harness. A well trained parrot will put the harness on itself by slipping its head through the collar.

The name Niumataiwalu, translated as 'I came first at Walu beach' was in memory of his grandfather-Tuivanuakula 2 or Tuinaosara (also known as Kubunavanua) for winning the leadership race competition among Rokomautu's seventeen (17) grandchildren at Walu beach, Verata. He was the father of Uluilakeba 1Native Lands Commission (NLC) Tukutuku ni Yavusa ko Lakeba, Ratu Jekesoni Yavala- Tubou Lakeba, Lau, 1930 Qoma was the elder brother of Delaivugalei; the latter the father of Niumataiwalu. Both were sons of Kalouyalewa, who was the brother of Buivaroro (the second Tui Nayau), and they had one sister, Adi Keletu was married to Noco in Rewa. Kalouyalewa's father was Tuivanuakula 2 and otherwise known as Tuinaosara. Niumataiwalu killed his uncle Qoma and his sons, in retribution for the murder of his own parents and sibling. This series of events eventually paved the way for his descendants overlordship of both these islands and the rest of Lau. In establishing his dynasty he is often recognised as the first Sau of the Lau Islands. The Vuanirewa clan was established later by his children. Legend, scandal and death Traditional legend has it that Niumataiwalu was renowned not only for his valour in battle but also for his beauty. This latter attribute would eventually attract the attention of one of the noble ladies of Bau, causing an illicit affair and leading to his eventual demise, for the lady was Adi Davila of Nairai, the Radini Levuka, wife of the Vunivalu or Paramount Chief of the Kubuna Confederacy. The adulterous affair did not come to light until the Radini Levuka, Adi Davila realized she was pregnant, and though she and her child, Banuve Baleivavalagi, were not harmed, the Vunivalu, Buinivuaka Nailatikau, bided his time and planned revenge for this offence upon himself and his noble household. He tendered the support of two Ono-i-Lau chiefs, Saunikalou and Radua who were visiting Bau at the time and were subjects of Niumataiwalu, by presenting them with a tabua made of black stone and requesting for the murder of their overlord. In time Niumataiwalu visited Matokano Village in Ono-i-Lau and a welcoming feast was accordingly prepared for him. This was also an occasion the two conspiring chiefs saw as an opportunity to exact the earlier instructions of the Vunivalu. As all weapons were forbidden in the area where the kava ceremony was to take place, Saunikalou hid a war club in a hollowed out banana stem and instructed his young son to play with it as a toy where the ceremony occurred. When the first appropriations of kava drink was being given to Niumataiwalu, unsuspecting he lowered his head, at which the same time Saunikalou grabbed the hidden weapon and struck him. The first blow did not kill Niumataiwalu, and he fled towards the beach in the hope of gaining aid from some of his men. He was however overpowered by Saunikalou and his men, and was clubbed to death. Local legend states that the area where Niumataiwalu was killed is cursed for the spilling of his noble blood. The vegetation in this area called \\"Cuga\\" still retains a whitish tinge amidst a surrounding area of deep green, as it is believed by locals to be cursed. Due to its tragic history, this area is the only place on the island not belonging to the people of Ono-i-Lau as it traditionally belongs to the Vuanirewa and remains so today. In the 20th century, the Vuanirewa descendants of Niumataiwalu made attempts to retrieve his remains for reburial in Tubou, Lakeba. Lineage Niumataiwalu had three wives from which he had many children. Four of his sons would eventually in turn succeed to his title. The recorded wives and children of this chief in order of seniority were: *By wife of Vunivalu of Bau, the Radini Levuka **Ratu Banuve Baleivavalagi (father of Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa) *By his first wife Tarau of Tovu Totoya **Sivoki **Uluilakeba I **Rasolo **Mokoi *By his second wife Uma of Nukunuku **Matawalu *By his third wife (name unknown) from Cakaudrove **Lubati References * Yalo i Viti: Shades of Viti : a Fiji Museum Catalogue - Page 173 by Fergus Clunie, Fiji Museum, Julia Brooke-White - 1986; following is a snippet: Leha died trying to save Niumataiwalu, the father of the first Tui Nayau to rule Lakeba.

He sat as a Liberal and was the chairman of the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. Along with Senator William Daum Euler, Hayden helped change the law that had prohibited the sale of margarine in Canada. Of note, this was the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's (JCPC) last case under the trade and commerce power of the BNA Act, and one of the last six judgements on a Canadian issue. During the 1970s, he helped extend Senate rule, 74.(1).Robert Marleau and Camille Montpetit.

At the initiative of Senator Hayden, this practice was broadened to apply to other bills, and it has since been referred to as the ‚ÄúHayden formula.‚Äù This allows the Senate to pre-study the subject matter, and to form an initial opinion of a bill that has been introduced in the House of Commons, even before it has been adopted for its first reading in the Senate. When the bill is received, the Senate can adopt or amend it in a timely manner. He resigned from the Senate on November 1, 1983 due to ill health.

Located along Pennsylvania Route 309, Orefield has the zip code of 18069. Its name is derived from the extensive deposits of limonite (iron ore) once mined here. It was once the terminus of the Siegersville Branch of the Ironton Railroad, which was extended here to haul the ore. Orefield is the former home to Parkland High School. It is a part of the Lehigh Valley and is only a few miles outside of Allentown. It is surrounded by many suburban housing developments, many of which were former farms operated by the Pennsylvania Dutch whose influence in the community is waning. There are many covered bridges nearby which cross the Jordan Creek. Located near Orefield is a large factory for Alpo Dog Food, which has been owned by the Ralston Purina Company since the 1990s. Also located nearby are the Jaindl turkey farms; Orefield's turkey farms provide the already-slaughtered turkeys that are presented to the president each Thanksgiving (the live turkeys that are pardoned at the same presentation come from rotating locations). Located in Orefield is Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre, the second drive-in ever built (1934) and America's oldest operating drive-in theater. Orefield is served by the Parkland School District, which has Orefield Middle School in the village.

Biography Wildenbruch was born at Beirut in Lebanon, the son of the Prussian consul-general, Ludwig von Wildenbruch, who was himself an illegitimate son of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia. Having passed his early years at Athens and Constantinople, where his father was attached to the Prussian legation, he came in 1857 to the Kingdom of Prussia, received his early schooling at the Padagogium at Halle and the Franz√∂sische Gymnasium in Berlin, and, after passing through the cadet school, became, in 1863, an officer in the Prussian Army. Two years later Wildenbruch abandoned his military career, but was recalled to the colors in 1866 for the Austro- Prussian War. He next studied law at the University of Berlin, and again served in the army during the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71). In 1876 Wildenbruch was attached to the foreign office, which he finally quit in 1900 with the title of counsellor of legation. He achieved his first literary successes with the epics Vionville (1874) and Sedan (1875). After publishing a volume of poems, Lieder und Balladen (1877), he produced, in 1882, the tragedy Die Karolinger. Wildenbruch married Maria Karoline von Weber, daughter of the engineer Max Maria von Weber and niece to Carl Maria von Weber, in 1885. The couple had no children. Wildenbruch's dramas include the tragedy Harold (1882); Die Quitzows (1888); Der Generalfeldoberst (1889); Die Haubenlerche (1891); Heinrich und Heinrichs Geschlecht (1895); Die Tochter des Erasmus (1900); and K√∂nig Laurin (1902). He also wrote several volumes of short stories (Novellen, 1883; Neue Novellen, 1885; Tiefe Wasser, 1897, and others). He was twice (in 1884 and 1896) awarded the Schiller Prize, and was, in 1892, made a doctor of philosophy honoris causa by the University of Jena. He died at Berlin in 1909.

Attractions  The main experience at Discovery Cove is swimming with a dolphin, where visitors can ‚Äútalk, touch, play and swim‚Äù with bottlenose dolphins. The park contains a free-flight aviary, which contains over 250 tropical birds including parrots, toucans, and over 30 other species of exotic birds. The heated Tropical River runs through the aviary and circles the park, allowing guests to float past an assortment of the Discovery Cove‚Äôs beaches, waterfalls, and rainforest landscape. The Tropical River runs into the park‚Äôs freshwater resort pool. In June 2011, the park expanded with the opening of The Grand Reef. This reef was needed due to the original reef having a persistent salt water leak, which affected the ground water, and replaced the original reef with Freshwater Oasis. The Grand Reef features a white-sand beach, palm-lined island and underwater grottos filled with moray eels, reef sharks and scores of other tropical fish. Activities range from snorkeling with eagle rays to crossing a rope bridge over a shark-filled lagoon.  Admission  Discovery Cove admission is all-inclusive and options include tickets to SeaWorld Orlando, Aquatica Orlando, and Busch Gardens Tampa. Three different admission options are offered by the park, including the dolphin-swim, non-dolphin-swim and ‚ÄúTrainer for a Day‚Äù packages.

The film is about an old street musician (played by Sellers) who strikes up a friendship with two children - Liz, played by Donna Mullane, and her younger brother Mark, played by John Chaffey. Neither of the child actors was featured in future films. A young Keith Chegwin also played a small role. Mullane was recruited for her role by the film crew when they were scouting locations and saw her as she was walking home from school Plot The story revolves around Sam, a dignified, former music hall artist who now works with his elderly trained dog Bella, busking in the West End of London. He lives in a run down goods yard alongside a derelict canal in Nine Elms. Two young children, Liz and Mark, stumble upon his yard whilst out walking. He chases them away, but his manner attracts their attention and, despite his best efforts, they later follow him as he goes off to work pushing his dog and all his busking paraphernalia in an Edwardian pram. Liz and Mark live nearby with their parents, Chrissie and Bob, and baby brother James in a drab, cramped basement flat. Bob works at the local gasworks and the family are desperate to move to a new Council flat. When they're out of school, their mother has little time for Liz and Mark and they find their own adventures together on the streets. Begrudgingly, Sam develops a relationship with the children as they tag along. Having mentioned it in passing, he agrees to take them to visit the pet cemetery in Hyde Park, where he anticipates Bella will be buried someday after an elaborate funeral, the next day on his way to the West End. They also discuss visiting the new flats. During the following day, it becomes clear that Bella is increasingly frail and Sam is worried about her. At the new flats, he tells them how his wife died ten years previously and how his seven grown up children are now scattered all over the world. He has found human beings unreliable throughout his life and ‚Äúonly dogs can be depended upon‚Äù. Bella is his best friend and, although getting a new flat was all very well, getting a dog was more important. Between them, they conclude the family needs a dog and, having established the children would look after it properly, Sam agrees to help them get one. The following afternoon, he takes them to Battersea Dogs Home where, posing as their grandfather, he helps them choose a dog. However, Sam is astounded and angry when the home tell him they can only take the dog if it is paid for. The children and Sam leave the home bitterly disappointed and, having admonished the children for telling lies as ‚Äúhe wasn‚Äôt their grandfather‚Äù, Sam tells them they will have to ask their mum and dad for the money and leaves, humiliated. The children return home despondent and are further discouraged when their mum seems unsympathetic to the idea of getting a dog. The children resolve to try to save the money to get it anyway and make money doing odd jobs. When they next see Sam, he is crotchety, and Bella is very ill. Sam offers to pay them to baby-sit Bella while he is working and having haggled about the fee, they agree. The following day they resolve to visit their dad at work to see if he will give them the balance to pay for their dog, but he tells them he needs to save everything he can if he is to have a hope of getting the flat. They return to Sam who, reluctant to concede that Bella's condition is terminal, agrees to give them the balance they need as an advance for more baby-sitting duties. Next day, they learn they have got the new flat and, together with Sam, collect their dog which they name Battersea. They return home later to be told they should not have bought the dog. They discover that the new flat is in Nine Elms, not the flats they had seen with Sam in Westminster, and that dogs are not allowed. The children run off to Sam's, where they find Sam drunk and in mourning for Bella. They try to give Battersea to Sam, but he rejects it and, when they talk of the majestic funeral for Bella, he laughs and tells them she will go in the dustcart. He leaves and, after tying Battersea to his table, the children take Bella's body, and at night sneak into the cemetery at Hyde Park and bury it there. They hide when their dad and Sam arrive outside the cemetery with Battersea, but fall asleep as the two talk into the night about life, death, dogs and children. When they awake the following morning Dad is overjoyed to see them and they leave Battersea with Sam.

Both films were set to cockney music hall songs, lending a clear continuity between the works. Buster Keaton was to have played the lead role of Sam, however British financiers were not convinced of Keaton's box office potential and the project collapsed. The novel was first published in 1964. Critical reception Variety wrote, \\"It all sounds like goo, and the film‚Äôs last half-hour verges perilously close. But even at its worst The Optimists is acceptable family fare, and for much of its first 80 minutes it engagingly achieves a sense of fantasy.\\" while The New York Times described the film as \\"the sort of old- fashioned excursion into sentiment that ought to warm the hearts of parents in search of that elusive piece of merchandise that goes under the name of good family entertainment. Peter Sellers, with a wardrobe of old music hall clothes, a talented but aged dog named Bella and a pram he pushes around London, plays the lonely, idiosyncratic old busker. And commendably, he submerges himself sufficiently in the part to allow old Sam to have a life of his own.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E3DC1F3BE53ABC4152DFB6678388669EDE References  External links  * Category:1974 films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:1973 drama films Category:English- language films Category:Films directed by Anthony Simmons Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films scored by George Martin Category:Films set in London Category:1974 drama films ","title":"The Optimists of Nine Elms"},{"id":"2136640","text":"Frank Wheaton (May 8, 1833 ‚Äì June 18, 1903) was a career military officer in the United States Army during the American Civil War and Indian Wars.

Civil War When the Civil War started, Wheaton was commissioned as lieutenant colonel of the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry on July 10, 1861. His father-in-law from his first marriage, General Samuel Cooper, was the ranking general for the Confederacy, whereas Wheaton fought for the Union. Wheaton's unit fought at the First Battle of Bull Run, where its commander, Col. John Slocum, was killed. Wheaton took command of the unit, was promoted to colonel effective July 21, 1861, and led the 2nd Rhode Island during the Peninsula Campaign, where he was commended for his actions at the Battle of Williamsburg. At the Battle of Antietam, the regiment was kept in the rear and out of the battle.Tagg, pp. 115-116. On November 29, 1862, Wheaton was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers and placed in command of the 3rd Brigade (62d NY, 93d Pa, 98th Pa, 102 Pa & 139 Pa), 3rd Division, VI Corps. He led them in heavy fighting at the Battle of Chancellorsville. His brigade, under the command of Colonel David J. Nevin of the 62nd New York, was the only brigade of the VI Corps to see action on the afternoon of the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg after completing a forced march of approximately 30 miles from Manchester, Maryland that day. At Gettysburg he commanded the 3rd Division while its commander, Maj. Gen. John Newton, temporarily commanded the I Corps, in place of John F. Reynolds. Wheaton remained in command of the brigade during Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign in 1864, as well as during the subsequent Siege of Petersburg. His men were hurried by train to Washington, D.C., in time to help repel Jubal Early's raid on the capital. During the ensuing operations in the Shenandoah Valley, under Maj. Gen.

At the First Battle of the Stronghold on January 17, 1873, he faced about fifty Modoc warriors in well defended positions amongst the lava fields of Northern California in a dense fog. Wheaton's troops suffered 35 deaths and many more wounded compared to no casualties on the Modoc side. Wheaton was subsequently relieved of command of the troops in the field.First Battle for the Stronghold, Associated Press, January 20, 1873; California Military Museum.

Bacolor is the birthplace of Father Anselmo Jorge de Fajardo, considered the \\"Father of Kapampangan literature\\" for writing the 1831 Kapampangan \\"kumidya\\" Don Gonzalo de Cordova. History Don Guillermo Manabat, a rich landlord, is believed to be the founder of Bacolor in 1574. Historical records show that Bacolor has been in existence as a proposed settlement as early as 1571, the same year Manila was founded by the Spanish. When the Spaniards arrived in Bacolor they found Bak√∫lud; its original name meant \\"level ground\\" because the site was formerly part of the Luzon coastline until eruptions from Mount Pinatubo raised it above the ocean floor. The first settlers of Bacolor were believed to be Malays that came from Atjeh in Sumatra led by Panday Pira. It is believed to have been founded by Monmon, first cousin and sister-in-law of Malangsic, a son of Prince Balagtas. However, historians recorded the official foundation of Bacolor in 1574 through a landlord named Guillermo Manabat, whose palatial house and resting place is now the site of the San Guillermo Church, hence the church's name. The name Bak√∫lud was changed to Bac√≥lor with the advent of the Spanish. Bacolor officially became the capital of Pampanga in 1755. According to Spanish chronicler Fray Gaspar de San Agustin, before 1755, Mexico town ‚Äúes la corte de Pampanga,‚Äù while Bacolor ‚Äúes la capital‚Äù and Guagua ‚Äúes igualmente.‚Äù Historian Dr. Luciano Santiago theorizes that before Bacolor was formally recognized as provincial capital, it was already informally functioning as capital although other provincial administrative offices were elsewhere in Mexico and Guagua. Monument to Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar in Bacolor During the British Occupation of the Philippines, when Manila fell to the British, it became capital of the exiled government of Governor General Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar from October 6, 1762 to May 30, 1764. The provincial offices were temporarily moved to Factor√≠a (now San Isidro, Nueva Ecija). Through a decree of the King of Spain on November 9, 1765, Bacolor became Villa de Bac√≥lor, one of the only three villas in the Philippines and was granted a special coat of arms. Sim√≥n de Anda organized an army of natives for the defense of Bacolor and with the aim of recapturing Manila. It remained the capital of Pampanga until the provincial seat of government was transferred to neighboring San Fernando in 1904. Moves to transfer the provincial capital to San Fernando actually began as early as 1852 with an expediente from the alcalde mayor. The King of Spain granted the request in a real cedula dated 11 September 1881. Despite royal approval, the transfer was not executed until August 15, 1904, by virtue of Act No. 1204. The coming of the American colonizers broke up the military form of government and instead political and economic reforms were introduced. A civil form of government was organized and was inaugurated on February 13, 1901 by Com. William H. Taft which took place in the old Escuela de Artes y Oficios de Bac√≥lor, later known as the Pampanga School of Arts and Trade and now the Don Honorio Ventura Technological State University, the first state university in Pampanga. The first provincial Civil Governor was Don Ceferino Joven and the first Municipal President of Bacolor was Don Estanislao Santos. Pampanga was acknowledged as the first province to have organized civil government in the Philippines by General Grant, the then President of the United States of America. When the Second World War broke out, Japanese fighter and bomber planes invaded the municipal town in Bacolor on December 1941 until the town was occupied by the Imperial Japanese forces in 1942. Pampangan guerrillas and Hukbalahap Communist groups joined in an insurgency centered around the municipality of Bacolor, supported by local soldiers and military officers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. Their attacks against the Japanese occupation continued until 1945, when Filipino and American forces liberated the municipality of Bacolor. In 1956, the sitio of Mesalipit was converted into a barrio. On the morning of October 1, 1995, over of lahar from the slopes of Mount Pinatubo and surrounding mountains buried the entire barangay of Cabalantian among many others, killing hundreds of people. 18 out of the 21 barangays of Bacolor were buried. The lahar flows from the mountains raised the town to its current level of an approximate 37 meters above sea level. Subsidence caused the constant reclaiming of parts of Pampanga by the sea. Barangays Bacolor is politically subdivided into 21 barangays. Climate Demographics In the , the population of Bacolor, Pampanga, was people, with a density of . Local government Fa√ßade of the town hall Like other towns in the Philippines, Bacolor is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the barangays or barrios. =Town hall= The municipal building is the former site of the Venturas house, one of Bacolor's most prominent families. On July 8, 1953, the new town hall was completed during the tenure of Mayor Manuel de Jesus. Its construction was a project of Senator Pablo √Ångeles y David, a native of Bacolor. Tourism Welcome arch The main landmark of the town is the San Guillermo Parish Church known as the 'sunken church', one of the structures that was half-buried by the lava flow from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The church has since been renovated and is currently operational and may be accessed through what were once the second floor windows, now converted into doorways. The sunken church and town of Bacolor were used to shoot the 2009‚Äì2010 ABS-CBN primetime television series May Bukas Pa. The Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes in Cabetican is also famous for its annual pilgrimage and barrio fiestas. Other notable landmarks in Bacolor include Memorial Kilometer Posts of the Bataan Death March along the MacArthur Highway; the oldest trade school in Far East, the Don Honorio Ventura Technological State University; the Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar monument at the town hall; monument to the Kapampangan writer and revolutionary leader Juan Crisostomo Soto (1867-1918); and Monument to Felix Galura Y Napao.

He was a Calvinist writer of note. Life He was born to poor Protestant parents near Bischofszell, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. His university career, first at Ingolstadt (1595‚Äë1596) and then at Altdorf near Nuremberg (1597‚Äë1598), was cut short by his poverty, from which he suffered all his life and which was the main cause of his wanderings. In 1598 he found a rich protector in Bartholomaeus Schobinger of St. Gall, who enabled him to study at St. Gall (where he first became interested in medieval documents, which abound in the Abbey of St. Gall) and elsewhere in Switzerland. The year before his patron's death in 1604, he became secretary to Henri, duc de Bouillon, with whom he went to Heidelberg and Frankfurt. In 1604 he entered the service of the Baron von Hohensax, the possessor of the Codex Manesse, the precious manuscript volume of old German Minnes√§nger of which Goldast published excerpts. Soon he was back in Switzerland, and by 1606 in Frankfurt, earning his living by preparing and correcting books for the press. In 1611 he was appointed councillor at the court of Saxe-Weimar, and in 1615 he entered the service of Graf Ernst von Schaumburg at Buckeburg. In 1624 he was forced by developments in the Thirty Years War to retire to Bremen; there in 1625 he deposited his library in that of the town,His books were bought by the town in 1646, but many of his manuscripts passed to Queen Christina of Sweden, and hence are now in the Vatican Library. he himself returning to Frankfurt. In 1627 he became councillor to Emperor Ferdinand II and to the archbishop- elector of Trier, and in 1633 passed to the service of the landgrave of Hesse- Darmstadt. He died at Gie√üen early in 1635. Bibliography His immense industry is shown by the fact that his biographer, Heinrich Christian Senckenberg, gives a list of 65 works published or written by him, some extending to several substantial volumes. Among the more important are his Paraeneticorum veterum pars i. (1604), which contained the old German tales of Kunig Tyrol von Schotten, the Winsbeke and the Winsbekin; Suevicarum rerum scriptores (Frankfurt, 1605, new edition, 1727); Rerum Alamannicarum scriptores (Frankfurt, 1606, new edition by Senckenburg, 1730); Constitutiones imperiales (Frankfurt, 1607‚Äë1613, 4 vols.); Monarchia sacri Romani imperii (Hanover and Frankfurt, 1612‚Äë1614, 3 vols.); and Commentarii de regni Bohemiae juribus (Frankfurt, 1627, new edition by Schmink, 1719). He also edited Jacques Auguste de Thou's Historia sui temporis (1609‚Äë1610) and the works of Willibald Pirckheimer (1610). In 1688 a volume of letters addressed to him by his learned friends was published. Notes References * Graeme Dunphy: \\"Melchior Goldast und Martin Opitz.

Duncan Mclean, Gordon Legge, Barry Graham and Sandie Craigie were involved in setting it up. For a time Sandie was its co-editor. It adroitly managed to tap into the darker undercurrent of Scottish society in the post-Thatcher era, capturing its counter-cultural rejection of mainstream values in its ethos. Rebel Inc Magazine ran to five issues between 1992 and 1994, publishing new work by writers such as Irvine Welsh, Alan Warner, Laura Hird, Toni Davidson and John King before any of them had books in print. Issue 4 featured an infamous 'Ecstasy Interview' - an unedited conversation between Kevin Williamson and Irvine Welsh whilst both editor and writer were under the influence of the psychoactive drug, MDMA. In his blog of February 2008, Kevin Williamson wrote \\"I pulled a stunt on Radio Scotland which satisfied the Malcolm McLaren criteria of \\"establishing the name\\", as related to one of the finest exploitation movies of all time: The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle.\\"Blog: Lesson Number 2: Establish The Name In 1996, following the success of Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh, Rebel Inc. was incorporated into the Canongate Books stable of independent publishers. A steady stream of eclectic but edgy releases then ensued, with out-of-print editions by the likes of Alexander Trocchi and Sadegh Hedayat, themselves substantially influential on many of the recent darker Scots authors like Welsh and Alan Warner. It also brought on a new generation of foreign writers such as Henry Baum, Joel Rose and Ray Loriga, who shared its outlook nonetheless. The Rebel Inc. imprint came to a premature end as a result of increasing friction between Williamson and Canongate over the creative and commercial direction of the imprint, which led to Williamson's resignation and departure from the company in January 2001. The imprint ended abruptly at the very height of its success although Canongate would later claim this was due to financial restructuring. Many of Rebel Inc.'s titles and authors were subsequently transferred into the main Canongate itinerary. In 2012 Williamson announced plans to revive Rebel Inc. on its 20th anniversary.

The TP rejected both capitalism and communism, looking instead to found a political and economic Third Position, with its main influence being Julius Evola. The group became a front for the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (NAR) in 1980. It insisted on tradition, nationalism, anti-parliamentarism and militarism. Overview The group was founded by ex-members of previous neo- fascist groups such as Ordine Nuovo, Avanguardia Nazionale, , Fronte Studentesco, disbanded for apology of fascism. was the leader of the group, with Roberto Fiore and Gabriele Adinolfi amongst its most important ideologues. Massimo Morsello was also a member. Parallel to the official organization, an operative clandestine nucleus was formed, led by Peppe Di Mitri. The movement did not last long as Di Mitri was arrested soon after its founding. When he was arrested in the summer of 1980, the structure merged with Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari. The group motto was N√® fronte rosso n√® reazione, Terza Posizione (Ital. \\"Neither red front nor reaction, Third Position\\"). The group logo was a variation of the Wolfsangel symbol, with the central bar substituted by a fist holding a hammer. Terza Posizione was one of the various Italian neofascist groups of the '70s (along with Lotta di Popolo, for example) that attempted to break the wall between radical left and radical right ideologies. Terza Posizione platform supported a social, corporativist state and looked with interest at both the Per√≥n Argentina and the Vietcongs.  Terza Posizione and the NAR  On December 1979, in one of the premises of the organization, three members were arrested, having been caught while moving a box of hand grenades. After the incident, the police found several Carabinieri uniforms, false papers, arms and explosives. As a result, in September 1980, Fiore, Adinolfi and forty members of Terza Posizione received a warrant of arrest. Fiore and Adinolfi escaped abroad, leaving the leadership of the group to Giorgio Vale (a member of Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari). The NAR's Giusva Fioravanti would later accuse Fiore and Adinolfi of absconding with the movement's money. Without Di Mitri's lead, the NAR quickly took control and used TP as a front movement. Investigations into activities In June 1983, judge Mario Amato, who was investigating the links between the Terza Posizione and neo-fascist terrorism, was assassinated by a commando formed by Gilberto Cavallini and Luigi Ciavardini. The instigators of the killing were NAR members Francesca Mambro and Valerio Fioravanti. (Both were convicted of other terrorist killings and the 1980 Bologna massacre). The judge had been investigating in isolation from his superiors, like the chief prosecutor Giovanni De Matteo, a member of Propaganda Due, and under heavy attacks from his colleague Antonio Alibrandi, a right-wing sympathizer and father of Alessandro Alibrandi, member of Terza Posizione and NAR. Legacy of Terza Posizione Despite its brief life and ambiguous relationships with terrorist groups, Terza Posizione remains one of the most influential groups of the Italian and European far right. Many of its former members continued to play prominent roles in the far right politics after the disbanding of the original association. Peppe Dimitri later joined Alleanza Nazionale and became the advisor of Gianni Alemanno. Fiore and Morsello, meanwhile, repaired to Great Britain founding the International Third Position along with Nick Griffin and other British nationalists. They then returned some of their ideals to Italian politics with Forza Nuova, albeit with less social-oriented and more strictly anti-immigration overtones. Forza Nuova web sites and manifests are still sometimes titled Forza Nuova per la Terza Posizione (\\"New Force for the Third Position\\"). Gabriele Adinolfi is not formally involved in politics but he is still active in the Italian far right scene as an ideologue and thinker. Political ideas of the Terza Posizione are now represented in Italy by Forza Nuova, led by Fiore; and by the movement CasaPound, a network of far-right social centres.

In 2007 it merged with Heathfield School to become Heathfield St Mary's School (later reverted to Heathfield) and the Wantage site was closed. It was affiliated with the Church of England and had close ties with its founding order, the Community of St Mary the Virgin. It was predominantly a boarding school. History The Reverend William John Butler became Vicar of Wantage on 1 January 1847. His main aims were, first, to revive the religious life in England and second, to improve education. He hoped to achieve these aims by setting up an order of teaching sisters, but he faced many disappointments and spent 25 years trying to improve various day schools in the parish before St Mary‚Äôs School was founded in 1873. Together with its sister school, the School of St Helen and St Katharine in Abingdon, St Mary's was run by the sisters of the Community of St Mary the Virgin and was based in the Queen Anne house on Newbury Street. Sister Ellen was the first Sister-in-Charge and Sister Juliana succeeded her in 1887. Sister Juliana had studied at Cambridge and set a high standard for the girls, entering them for the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations. Sister Annie Louisa joined the school in 1898 and started a guide movement called Scout Patrols in 1899 before Boy Scouts had even begun. She succeeded Sister Juliana as Headmistress in 1903. Sister Annie Louisa was responsible for the chief structural improvements at St Mary‚Äôs including a science wing and the conversion of an old barn into a gymnasium. By the time Sister Annie Louisa left in 1919, St Mary‚Äôs was recognised as a ‚Äúpublic school with an unusually high standard of scholarship‚Äù. In 2005 the buildings were purchased for around ¬£15m by the property developer Anton Bilton and his company, Raven Mount.

Eliyahu de Vidas (1518‚Äì1587, Hebron) was a 16th-century rabbi in Ottoman Palestine. He was primarily a disciple of Rabbis Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (known as the Ramak) and also Isaac Luria.Fine 2003, pp. 81: \\"Cordovero was the teacher of what appears to have been a relatively loose knit circle of disciples. The most important Elijah de Vidas, Abraham Galante, Moses Galante, Hayyim Vital, Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim, Eleazar Azikri, Samuel Gallico, and an important kabbalist who studied with Cordovero for a short while in the 1560s, Mordechai Dato.\\" De Vidas is known for his expertise in the Kabbalah. He wrote Reshit Chochmah, or \\"The Beginning of Wisdom,\\" a pietistic work that is still widely studied by Orthodox Jews today. Just as his teacher Rabbi Moses Cordovero created an ethical work according to kabbalistic principles in his Tomer Devorah, Rabbi de Vidas created an even more expansive work on the spiritual life with his Reishit Chochmah. This magnum opus is largely based on the Zohar, but also reflects a wide range of traditional sources. The author lived in Safed and Hebron, and was one of a group of prominent kabbalists living in Hebron during the late 16th and early 17th-century. Aaron ben Menahem Mendel of Kamenitz, the first hotelier in the Land of Israel, references his visit to the grave of Eliyahu de Vidas in his 1839 book Sefer Korot Ha-Itim. He states, \\"here I write of the graves of the righteous to which I paid my respects.\\" After describing the Cave of Machpela and the tombs of such Biblical figures as Ruth and Jesse, Othniel Ben Knaz and Abner Ben Ner, he reports, \\"I also went to a grave said to be that of the Righteous Rav, author of \\"Reshit Hokhma.\\" Today the grave site has been refurbished and can be visited in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Hebron.

Liu Shifu (; 1884 ‚Äì 27 March 1915) was an influential figure in the Chinese revolutionary movement in the early twentieth century, and in the Chinese Anarchist movement in particular. He was a key figure in the movement, particularly in Canton province, and one of the most important organizers in the Chinese Anarchist tradition. He began his radical career as a member of the China Assassination Corps, an anti-colonial movement which was strongly influenced by the tactics of the Russian Nihilist movement and advocated revolutionary terrorism and the assassination of criminal elites. Upon conversion to anarchism he denounced these tactics as counter-productive and switched his focus to grass-roots organizing among peasants and workers in order to build a revolutionary mass movement. He was one of the first Chinese Revolutionaries to seriously advocate Peasant organizing as a key element of his revolutionary strategy. In 1912 Liu founded the Society of Cocks Crowing in the Dark (a.k.a. Cock-Crow Society), whose journal, People's Voice, was the leading organ of Chinese anarchism in the 1910s. Liu was a skilled expositor of anarchist doctrine and his polemical exchanges with the socialist leader Jiang Kanghu helped to popularize anarchism as a ‚Äúpure socialism‚Äù and to distinguish it from other currents in socialist thought. The Cock-Crow Society, also known as the \\"Guangzhou Group\\", is usually described as being ‚Äúled‚Äù by Liu, and this is generally accurate insofar as we understand it as leadership by example since he was never granted any formal position or coercive authority by the group. Their most significant contributions at this stage were the foundation of ‚Äúan alliance between intellectuals and workers‚Äù and their propaganda work which set out to differentiate anarchism from all the other socialisms that were gaining in popularity; and in so doing crystallized for the first time exactly what anarchism was. The Guangzhou group used positive assertions of rights and workers, women, peasants, and other oppressed groups to outline their vision of an anarchist society. Noticeably absent was any mention of Ethnic minorities, since a basic part of their platform was the elimination of ethnic, racial, and national identities in favor of an internationalist identity that placed primary importance on loyalty to humanity as a whole, instead of to ones ethnic or racial group. It is important to recognize that this position was formulated in response to the primacy placed on ethnicity by the Anti-Manchu movement, which sought to assert the illegitimacy of the Qing dynasty based in part on the fact that its members were part of an ethnic minority out of touch with the Han majority, a position which Anarchists of all four major groups decried as racist and unbefitting a movement that claimed to be working for liberation. Their position, therefore, was that ethnicity-based organizing promoted racism, and had no place in a revolution that sought liberation for all of humanity. He was very active in the movement for the international language Esperanto, in which he used the pseudonym Sifo.  Further reading  * Chan, Pik-Chong Agnes Wong.

He objected to the system of indulgences, and has been called a ‚Äúreformer before the Reformation.‚Äù He was born at Oberwesel early in the 15th century. He appears to have been one of the leaders of the humanist movement in Germany, and to have had some intercourse and sympathy with the leaders of the Hussites in Bohemia. Erfurt was in his day the headquarters of a humanism which was both devout and opposed to the realist metaphysics and the Thomist theology which prevailed in the universities of Cologne and Heidelberg. Wesel was one of the professors at Erfurt between 1445 and 1456, and was vice-rector in 1458. In 1460 he was appointed preacher at Mainz, in 1462 at Worms, and in 1479, when an old and worn-out man, he was brought before the Dominican inquisitor Gerhard Elten of Cologne. The charges brought against him took a theological turn, though they were probably prompted by dislike of his philosophical views. They were chiefly based on a treatise, De indulgentiis, which he had composed while at Erfurt twenty-five years before. He had also written De potestate ecclesiastica. He died under sentence of imprisonment for life in the Augustinian convent in Mainz in 1481. Theology It is somewhat difficult to determine the exact theological orientation of Wesel. Ullmann claims him as a \\"reformer before the Reformation\\", but, while he mastered the formal principle of Protestantism, that scripture is the sole rule of faith, it is more than doubtful that he had that experimental view of the doctrines of grace which lay at the basis of Reformation theology. He held that Christ is men's righteousness in so far as they are guided by the Holy Ghost, and the love towards God is shed abroad in their hearts, which clearly shows that he held the medieval idea that justification is an habitual grace implanted in men by the gracious act of God. He seems, however, to have protested against certain medieval ecclesiastical ideas which he held to be excrescences erroneously grafted on Christian faith and practice. He objected to the whole system of indulgences; he denied the infallibility of the church, on the ground, that the church contains within it sinners as well as saints; he insisted that papal authority could be upheld only when the pope remained true to the evangel; and he held that a sharp distinction ought to be drawn between ecclesiastical sentences and punishments, and the judgments of God. Literature The best account of Wesel is to be found in K. Ullmann's Reformers before the Reformation. His tract on Indulgences is published in Walch's Monumenta Medii Aevi, vol. i., while a report of his trial is given in Ortwin's Fasciculus rerum expetendarum et fugiendarum (ed. by Browne, London, 1690), and d'Argentr√©'s Collectio judiciorum de novis erroribus (Paris, 1728).

The first Polish records of the surname date to the 15th century. Without diacritical marks, it is spelled Zielinski. The Russianized form is Zelinsky.

Thus, given the great number of similarly named localities, linguistically Zielin, Zielinca, Zieliniec and Zieli≈Ñsk would be the most perfect matches. Some others might include Zieleniec, Zielinice, Zieleniew, Zieleniewo, Ziele≈Ñ, Zielƒôcice, Zieliƒôcin, Zielniczki, Zielniki and Zielona. *Polish: a toponymic surname, with the toponym stemming from the word ziele≈Ñ, meaning the color green, or referring to vibrancy and youth.

Life He was a son of Hugh Bostock, and was born at Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire, owing his name, the Latin form of which is Frumentarius, to this circumstance. After early schooling at the Abbey School (now St Albans School) he entered St Albans Abbey when only sixteen. He was chosen abbot of this Benedictine monastery in 1420. In 1423, Whethamstede attended the Council of Siena. In the Kingdom of England, his time was mainly occupied with lawsuits, several of which he carried on to defend the property and enforce the rights of the abbey. In 1440, he resigned his post but, in 1451, on the death of his successor John Stoke, he became abbot for the second time. He died on 20 January 1465, and his tomb may still be seen in the abbey church. Whethamstede was an energetic and successful abbot. He greatly improved the buildings at St Albans, which suffered somewhat during his later years owing to the Wars of the Roses, the first open conflict of which was the First Battle of St Albans in 1455. He also did some building at Gloucester. He was also closely, if clumsily, associated with the humanistic activities of Henry V's youngest brother, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who died in 1447 and was buried in St Albans Abbey, where he was honoured as a benefactor.

A leaflet produced by the group described them as in favour of \\"man-to-man engagements\\" in which their members were to be encouraged to be as ruthless as possible.Magnus Linklater, Isabel Hilton & Neal Ascherson, The Fourth Reich: Klaus Barbie and the Neo-Fascist Connection, Hodder & Stoughton, 1984, p. 205 Members of the movement were frequently denounced as terrorists and it was claimed that Della Chiaie had links to bomb making concerns in Spain.

Characteristic 'ticking' alarm call of a European robin, Erithacus rubecula In animal communication, an alarm signal is an antipredator adaptation in the form of signals emitted by social animals in response to danger. Many primates and birds have elaborate alarm calls for warning conspecifics of approaching predators. For example, the alarm call of the blackbird is a familiar sound in many gardens. Other animals, like fish and insects, may use non-auditory signals, such as chemical messages. Visual signs such as the white tail flashes of many deer have been suggested as alarm signals; they are less likely to be received by conspecifics, so have tended to be treated as a signal to the predator instead. Different calls may be used for predators on the ground or from the air. Often, the animals can tell which member of the group is making the call, so that they can disregard those of little reliability.Biology Letters. Titi monkey call sequences vary with predator location and type Evidently, alarm signals promote survival by allowing the receivers of the alarm to escape from the source of peril; this can evolve by kin selection, assuming the receivers are related to the signaller. However, alarm calls can increase individual fitness, for example by informing the predator it has been detected. Alarm calls are often high- frequency sounds because these sounds are harder to localize. Selective advantage Alarm call by a rock squirrel This cost/benefit tradeoff of alarm calling behaviour has sparked many interest debates among evolutionary biologists seeking to explain the occurrence of such apparently \\"self- sacrificing\\" behaviour. The central question is this: \\"If the ultimate purpose of any animal behaviour is to maximize the chances that an organism's own genes are passed on, with maximum fruitfulness, to future generations, why would an individual deliberately risk destroying itself (their entire genome) for the sake of saving others (other genomes)?\\". = Altruism = Some scientists have used the evidence of alarm-calling behaviour to challenge the theory that \\"evolution works only/primarily at the level of the gene and of the gene's \\"interest\\" in passing itself along to future generations.\\" If alarm-calling is truly an example of altruism, then our understanding of natural selection becomes more complicated than simply \\"survival of the fittest gene\\". Other researchers, generally those who support the selfish gene theory, question the authenticity of this \\"altruistic\\" behaviour. For instance, it has been observed that vervets sometimes emit calls in the presence of a predator, and sometimes do not. Studies show that these vervets may call more often when they are surrounded by their own offspring and by other relatives who share many of their genes. Other researchers have shown that some forms of alarm calling, for example, \\"aerial predator whistles\\" produced by Belding's ground squirrels, do not increase the chances that a caller will get eaten by a predator; the alarm call is advantageous to both caller and recipient by frightening and warding off the predator. = Predator attraction = Another theory suggests that alarm signals function to attract further predators, which fight over the prey organism, giving it a better chance of escape. Others still suggest they are a deterrent to predators, communicating the animals alertness to the predator. One such case is the western swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio), which gives conspicuous visual tail flicks (see also aposematism, handicap principle and stotting). = Further research = Considerable research effort continues to be directed toward the purpose and ramifications of alarm-calling behaviour, because, to the extent that this research has the ability to comment on the occurrence or non- occurrence of altruistic behaviour, we can apply these findings to our understanding of altruism in human behaviour. Monkeys with alarm calls Vervet monkey in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania = Vervet monkeys = Vervet monkeys are the typical example of both animal alarm calls and of semantic capacity in non-human animals. They have three distinct calls for leopards, snakes, and eagles, and research shows that each call elicits different responses. When vervets are on the ground they respond to the eagle alarm call by looking up and running to cover, to leopard alarm calls primarily by looking up and running into a tree, and to the snake alarm call primarily by looking down. When in trees, vervets responded to the eagle alarm call by looking up and down and running out of trees, to the leopard alarm call by running higher in the tree and looking both up and down, and to the snake alarm call by looking primarily down. Each predator-specific behaviour is likely suited to escaping that predator, and, therefore, use of these escape behaviours is adaptive. Predator-specific alarm calls are an example of how monkeys organize a continuum of stimuli into categories that are judged to be more similar, and therefore belong to the same predator, or more different, and therefore belong to different predators. = Campbell's mona monkeys = Campbell's mona monkeys also generate alarm calls, but in a different way than vervet monkeys. Instead of having discrete calls for each predator, Campbell monkeys have two distinct types of calls which contain different calls which consist in an acoustic continuum of affixes which change meaning. It has been suggested that this is a homology to human morphology. Similarly, the cotton-top tamarin is able to use a limited vocal range of alarm calls to distinguish between aerial and land predators.Neyman, P. F. 1978. Aspects of the ecology and social organization of free-ranging cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) and the conservation status of the species. In: The Biology and Conservation of the Callitrichidae (Ed. by D. G. Kleiman), pp. 39e71. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. Both the Campbell monkey and the cotton-top tamarin have demonstrated abilities similar to vervet monkeys' ability to distinguish likely direction of predation and appropriate responses.Sproul et al. Cottontop tamarin, Saguinus oedipus, alarm calls contain sufficient information for recognition of individual identity. Animal Behaviour (2006) vol. 72 (6) pp. 1379-1385 That these three species use vocalizations to warn others of danger has been called by some proof of proto-language in primates. However, there is some evidence that this behavior does not refer to the predators themselves but to threat, distinguishing calls from words. = Barbary macaque = Another species that exhibits alarm calls is the Barbary macaque. Barbary macaque mothers are able to recognize their own offspring's calls and behave accordingly. Diana monkeys produce alarm calls that differ based on caller, threat type, and habitat. = Diana monkeys = Diana monkeys also produce alarm signals. Adult males respond to each other's calls, showing that calling can be contagious. Their calls differ based on signaller sex, threat type, habitat, and caller ontogenetic or lifetime predator experience. Diana monkeys emit different alarm calls as a result of their sex. Male alarm calls are primarily used for resource defence, male‚Äìmale competition, and communication between groups of conspecifics. Female alarm calls are mainly used for communication within groups of conspecifics to avoid predation. Alarm calls are also predator-specific. In Ta√Ø National Park, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Diana monkeys are preyed on by leopards, eagles, and chimpanzees, but only emit alarm calls for leopards and eagles. When threatened by chimpanzees, they use silent, cryptic behaviour and when threatened by leopards or eagles, they emit predator-specific alarm signals. When researchers play recordings of alarm calls produced by chimpanzees in response to predation by leopards, about fifty per cent of nearby Diana monkeys switch from a chimpanzee antipredator response to a leopard antipredator response. The tendency to switch responses is especially prominent among Diana monkey populations that live within the main range of the chimpanzee community. This shift in antipredator response suggests that the monkeys interpret chimpanzee-produced, leopard-induced alarm calls as evidence for the presence of a leopard. When the same monkeys are then played recordings of leopard growls, their reactions confirm that they had anticipated the presence of a leopard. There are three possible cognitive mechanisms explaining how Diana monkeys recognize chimpanzee-produced, leopard-induced alarm calls as evidence for a nearby leopard: associative learning, causal reasoning, or a specialized learning programme driven by adaptive antipredator behaviour necessary for survival. In Ta√Ø National Park and Tiwai Island, Sierra Leone, specific acoustic markers in the alarm calls of Diana monkeys convey both threat type and caller familiarity information to a receiver. In Ta√Ø National Park, males respond to eagle alarm signals based on predator type and caller familiarity. When the caller is unfamiliar to the receiver, the response call is a 'standard' eagle alarm call, characterized by a lack of frequency transition at the onset of the call. When the caller is familiar, the response call is an atypical eagle alarm call, characterized by a frequency transition at onset, and the response is faster than to that of unfamiliar caller. On Tiwai Island, males respond in the opposite way to eagle alarm signals. When the caller is familiar, the response call is a 'standard' eagle alarm call, without a frequency transition at onset. When the caller is unfamiliar, the response call is an atypical eagle alarm call, with a frequency transition at onset. The differences in alarm call responses are due to differences in habitat. In Ta√Ø National Park, there is a low predation risk from eagles, high primate abundance, strong intergroup competition, and a tendency for group encounters to result in high levels of aggression. Therefore, even familiar males are a threat to whom males respond with aggression and an atypical eagle alarm call. Only unfamiliar males, who are likely to be solitary and non-threatening, do not receive an aggressive response and receive only a typical alarm call. On Tiwai Island, there is a high predation risk from eagles, low primate abundance, a tendency for group encounters to result in peaceful retreats, low resource competition, and frequent sharing of foraging areas. Therefore, there is a lack of aggression towards familiar conspecifics to whom receivers respond with a 'standard' eagle call. There is only aggression towards unfamiliar conspecifics, to whom receivers respond with an atypical call. Simply put, a response with a typical eagle alarm call prioritizes the risk of predation, while a response with an atypical alarm call prioritizes social aggression. Diana monkeys also display a predisposition for flexibility in acoustic variation of alarm call assembly related to caller ontogenetic or lifetime predator experience. In Ta√Ø National Park and on Tiwai Island, monkeys have a predisposition to threat-specific alarm signals. In Ta√Ø National Park, males produce three threat-specific calls in response to three threats: eagles, leopards, and general disturbances. On Tiwai Island, males produce two threat-specific calls in response to two groups of threats: eagles, and leopards or general disturbances. The latter are likely grouped together because leopards have not been present on the island for at least 30 years. Other primates, such as Guereza monkeys and putty-nosed monkeys, also have two main predator-specific assemblies of alarm calls. Predator-specific alarm signals differ based on call sequence assembly. General disturbances in Ta√Ø National Park and both general disturbances and leopards on Tiwai Island result in alarm calls assembled into long sequences. Conversely, leopards in Ta√Ø National Park result in alarm calls that typically begin with voiced inhalations followed by a small number of calls. These differences in alarm call arrangement between habitats are due to ontogenetic experience; specifically, a lack of experience with leopards on Tiwai Island causes them to be classified in the same predator category as general disturbances, and accordingly, leopards receive the same type of alarm call arrangement. = Sexual selection for predator-specific alarm signals = In guenons, selection is responsible for the evolution of predator-specific alarm calls from loud calls. Loud calls travel long distances, greater than that of the home range, and can be used as beneficial alarm calls to warn conspecifics or showcase their awareness of and deter a predator. A spectrogram of a subadult male call shows that the call is a composition of elements from a female alarm call and male loud call, suggesting the transition from the latter to the former during puberty and suggesting that alarm calls gave rise to loud calls through sexual selection. Evidence of sexual selection in loud calls includes structural adaptations for long-range communication, co- incidence of loud calls and sexual maturity, and sexual dimorphism in loud calls. = Controversy over the semantic properties of alarm calls = Not all scholars of animal communication accept the interpretation of alarm signals in monkeys as having semantic properties or transmitting \\"information\\". Prominent spokespersons for this opposing view are Michael Owren and Drew Rendall, whose work on this topic has been widely cited and debated.Nordell, S. & Valone, T. (2014). Animal Behaviour: Concepts, Methods and Applications. Oxford University Press.Stegmann, U. E. editor (2013). Animal Communication Theory: Information and Influence. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 452 pages The alternative to the semantic interpretation of monkey alarm signals as suggested in the cited works is that animal communication is primarily a matter of influence rather than information, and that vocal alarm signals are essentially emotional expressions influencing the animals that hear them. In this view monkeys do not designate predators by naming them, but may react with different degrees of vocal alarm depending on the nature of the predator and its nearness on detection, as well as by producing different types of vocalization under the influence of the monkey's state and movement during the different types of escape required by different predators. Other monkeys may learn to use these emotional cues along with the escape behaviour of the alarm signaller to help make a good decision about the best escape route for themselves, without there having been any naming of predators. Chimpanzees with alarm calls Chimpanzees produce alarm calls in response to threats. Chimpanzees emit alarm calls in response to predators, such as leopards and snakes. They produce three types of alarm calls: acoustically-variable 'hoos', 'barks', and 'SOS screams'. Alarm signalling is impacted by receiver knowledge and caller age, can be coupled with receiver monitoring, and is important to the understanding of the evolution of hominoid communication. = Receiver knowledge = Alarm signalling varies depending on the receiver's knowledge of a certain threat. Chimpanzees are significantly more likely to produce an alarm call when conspecifics are unaware of a potential threat or were not nearby when a previous alarm call was emitted. Interestingly, when judging if conspecifics are unaware of potential dangers, chimpanzees do not solely look for behavioural cues, but also assess receiver mental states and use this information to target signalling and monitoring. In a recent experiment, caller chimpanzees were shown a fake snake as a predator and were played pre- recorded calls from receivers. Some receivers emitted calls that were snake- related, and therefore represented receivers with knowledge of the predator, while other receivers emitted calls that were not snake-related, and therefore represented receivers without knowledge of the predator. In response to the non-snake-related calls from receivers, the signallers increased their vocal and nonvocal signalling and coupled it with increased receiver monitoring. = Caller age = Chimpanzee age impacts the frequency of alarm signalling. Chimpanzees over 80 months of age are more likely to produce an alarm call than those less than 80 months of age. There are several hypotheses for this lack of alarm calling in infants zero to four years of age. The first hypothesis is a lack of motivation to produce alarm calls because of mothers in close proximity that minimize the infant's perception of a threat or that respond to a threat before the infant can. Infants may also be more likely to use distress calls to catch their mother's attention in order for her to produce an alarm call. Infants might also lack the physical ability to produce alarm calls or lack the necessary experience to classify unfamiliar objects as dangerous and worthy of an alarm signal. Therefore, alarm calling may require advanced levels of development, perception, categorization, and social cognition. = Other factors = Other factors, such as signaller arousal, receiver identity, or increased risk of predation from calling, do not have a significant effect on the frequency of alarm call production. = Receiver monitoring = However, while alarm signals can be coupled with receiver monitoring, there is a lack of consensus on the definition, starting age, and purpose of monitoring. It is either defined as the use of three subsequent gaze alternations, from a threat to a nearby conspecific and back to the threat, or as the use of two gaze alternations. Moreover, while some studies only report gaze alternation as starting in late juveniles, other studies report gaze alternation in infants as early as five months of age. In infants and juveniles, it is potentially a means of social referencing or social learning through which younger chimpanzees check the reactions of more experienced conspecifics in order to learn about new situations, such as potential threats. It has also been proposed to be a communicative behaviour or simply the result of shifts in attention between different environmental elements. = Evolution of hominoid communication = The evolution of hominoid communication is evident through chimpanzee 'hoo' vocalizations and alarm calls. Researchers propose that communication evolved as natural selection diversified 'hoo' vocalizations into context-dependent 'hoos' for travel, rest, and threats. Context-dependent communication is beneficial and likely maintained by selection as it facilities cooperative activities and social cohesion between signallers and receivers that can increase the likelihood of survival. Alarm calls in chimpanzees also point to the evolution of hominoid language. Callers assess conspecifics' knowledge of threats, fill their need for information, and, in doing so, use social cues and intentionality to inform communication. Filling a gap in information and incorporating social cues and intentionality into communication are all components of human language. These shared elements between chimpanzee and human communication suggest an evolutionary basis, most likely that our last common ancestor with chimpanzees also possessed these linguistic abilities. False alarm calls Deceptive vocalizations are given by male barn swallows. Deceptive alarm calls are used by male swallows (Hirundo rustica). Males give these false alarm calls when females leave the nest area during the mating season, and are thus able to disrupt extra-pair copulations. As this is likely to be costly to females, it can be seen as an example of sexual conflict.Arnqvist, G. & Rowe, L. (2005) Sexual conflict. Princeton University Press, Princeton Counterfeit alarm calls are also used by thrushes to avoid intraspecific competition. By sounding a bogus alarm call normally used to warn of aerial predators, they can frighten other birds away, allowing them to eat undisturbed.Wickler, W. (1968) Mimicry in Plants and Animals (Translated from the German) McGraw-Hill, New York. . p. 108. Vervets seem to be able to understand the referent of alarm calls instead of merely the acoustic properties, and if another species' specific alarm call (terrestrial or aerial predator, for instance) is used incorrectly with too high of a regularity, the vervet will learn to ignore the analogous vervet call as well. Alarm pheromones Alarm signals need not be communicated only by auditory means. For example, many animals may use chemosensory alarm signals, communicated by chemicals known as pheromones. Minnows and catfish release alarm pheromones (Schreckstoff) when injured, which cause nearby fish to hide in dense schools near the bottom.Campbell, N. & Reece, J. 2004. Biology 7th Edition - Benjamin Cummings Animals are not the only organism to communicate threats to conspecifics either; some plants are able to perform a similar trick. Lima beans release volatile chemical signals that are received by nearby plants of the same species when infested with spider mites. This 'message' allows the recipients to prepare themselves by activating defense genes, making them less vulnerable to attack, and also attracting another mite species that is a predator of spider mites (indirect defence). Although it is conceivable that other plants are only intercepting a message primarily functioning to attract \\"bodyguards\\", some plants spread this signal on to others themselves, suggesting an indirect benefit from increased inclusive fitness. False chemical alarm signals are also employed. The aphid Myzus persicae is repelled by the wild potato Solanum berthaultii which releases a chemical from its leaves that acts as an allomone to disrupt aphid attacks.

Originally known for bel canto performances of Rossini, Donizetti, and Vincenzo Bellini, she was the first non-Italian ever to win the prestigious Bellini d'Oro prize.June Anderson biography, Musicianguide.com; accessed February 2, 2018. Subsequently, she has extended her repertoire to include a wide variety of other roles, including those from the Russian repertoire and works by Richard Strauss. In 2008, Anderson was elevated to \\"Commandeur\\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government and in 2007 received a \\"Victoire d'honneur\\" at the \\"Victoires de la Musique Classique\\" in Paris.La c√©r√©monie des Victoires \\"classiques\\" au rythme de la musique am√©ricaine, MSN Actualit√©s , March 1, 2007. Anderson has performed in noted opera houses including La Scala, Covent Garden, La Fenice, Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago and Col√≥n Theater. She has collaborated with conductors Leonard Bernstein, James Levine, Charles Dutoit, Zubin Mehta, Riccardo Muti, Seiji Ozawa, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Kent Nagano and Michael Tilson Thomas. Early life June Anderson was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in Wallingford, Connecticut. She attended Lyman Hall High School where she was the 5th highest in academic standing among 505 graduates in the class of 1970. She began vocal studies at age 11 and at age 17 was the youngest finalist (at that time) in the Metropolitan Opera auditions.Walter Price, Music; A Soprano Who Feels She Can Say No, The New York Times, October 29, 1989. She received a degree from Yale University in French, graduating cum laude and then decided to pursue a career in singing. Anderson studied voice under Robert Leonard in New York City. She had numerous auditions but no engagements at first. She has said that she continued her pursuit as a challenge, giving herself a deadline of two years (after which she would, if unsuccessful, enter law school). \\"No one wanted to know my name. I was down to my last $50. That's when I decided I was going to be a singer if it killed me!\\"Opera News, August 1986. Career =Early career= Anderson sang in several productions in the Yale/New Haven area while still a high school student. In 1968, she sang in a production of Haydn's \\"L'infedelt√† delusa\\" at Yale University. In 1970 she appeared as Gilda with the New Haven Opera Company in a production of Verdi's Rigoletto. She made her professional opera debut as the Queen of the Night in Mozart's The Magic Flute at the New York City Opera in 1978.J. Warrack and E. West, The Oxford Dictionary of Opera (1992). Several years later, she would voice the Queen of the Night in the Oscar-winning Amadeus, directed by Milo≈° Forman. While at New York City Opera, she sang in a wide range of operas including The Golden Cockerel by Rimsky-Korsakov, Rigoletto and La Traviata by Verdi, Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Giulio Cesare by Handel, and Mozart's Don Giovanni (as Elvira). In 1981, she sang the three lead soprano roles in Les Contes d'Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach, the first soprano to do so at New York City Opera since Beverly Sills in 1973.Edward Rothstein, Review/Opera; June Anderson's 'Hoffman' Triple, The New York Times, March 9, 1981. =1980s= Anderson left New York City Opera in 1982 and embarked on a European career. Anderson's career in this decade was marked by numerous debuts in quintessential bel canto roles in major European opera houses. She also participated in the recording of operatic works rarely heard in this era, including: Rossini's Mos√® in Egitto, Wagner's Die Feen, Bizet's La jolie fille de Perth, Adolphe Adam's Le postillon de Lonjumeau, Fromental Hal√©vy's La Juive, and Daniel Auber's La muette de Portici. After being recommended to an Italian agent by Sherrill Milnes, she made her European performance debut in 1982 in the title role of Rossini's Semiramide in Rome. In 1983, Anderson debuted in Florence and Geneva in the title role of Lucia di Lammermoor by Donizetti, a part which became one of her most frequent portrayals. She also sang Die Feen by Wagner in Munich, and appeared in North America: Bellini's I puritani in Edmonton and Il barbiere di Siviglia in Seattle. In 1984, she performed her first Amina in Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula in Venice, opening 135 years to the day after Maria Malibran's final Amina in that same theatre. She also appeared as Marie in La fille du r√©giment by Donizetti in Parma. In 1985, Anderson debuted as Isabelle in the historic revival of Robert le Diable by Meyerbeer in Paris. That year she also appeared in a rarely seen Verdi work, La battaglia di Legnano, in Pittsburgh. In 1986, she performed her first Desdemona in Rossini's Otello in Venice. The same year, she made her debut at La Scala in Milan in La sonnambula, and her debut at Covent Garden in productions of Semiramide and Lucia di Lammermoor. She also appeared in La fille du r√©giment at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris. Anderson returned to the Op√©ra-Comique in 1987, appearing as Elvira in Bellini's I Puritani, and gave a recital at the Paris Opera with Alfredo Kraus. In Italy, she returned to La Scala for her debut as Giuletta in I Capuleti e i Montecchi and returned to Venice for her first performance of Beatrice di Tenda, also by Bellini. Anderson also appeared in a 1988 concert version of Beatrice di Tenda at Carnegie Hall, with the Opera Orchestra of New York. Elsewhere in 1988, Anderson focused on Rossini roles: playing her first Armida in Aix-en- Provence, appearing in Otello at the Pesaro Festival, and debuting as Anna in Maometto II (an early version of Rossini's Le si√®ge de Corinthe) at the San Francisco Opera (she had previously recorded this work with Samuel Ramey in 1983). She also appeared that year in Luisa Miller by Verdi at the Op√©ra National de Lyon. In 1989, she made her long-awaited debut at New York's Metropolitan Opera as Gilda in Rigoletto, with Luciano Pavarotti. The New York Times review wrote of her Met debut: > Miss Anderson's debut as Gilda, although belated, could not have been more > welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall > soprano left America a decade ago to build a phenomenal European career, > chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She > demonstrated in a Caro nome of exquisite taste, effortless fluidity and > pinpoint precision that she is a master of the bel canto style. She is > comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or > power. The wide leaps of the Caro nome coda were taken effortlessly and > squarely on the note. The Met audience does not often hear a trill as > thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as > grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.Donal Henahan, Review/Opera; > Review/Opera; Pavarotti and Vocalism Star in Met's 'Rigoletto', The New York > Times, November 6, 1989. In July 1989, she sang at the inaugural gala of the new Op√©ra Bastille in Paris, performing Ombre l√©g√®re from Le pardon de Plo√´rmel, by Meyerbeer. (Not a fan of the modernist space, Anderson was later quoted as saying, \\"The place looks like a gymnasium.\\"Witold Rybczynski, Sounds as Good as It Looks, The Atlantic, June 1996. ) Leonard Bernstein selected her to perform as Cunegonde in a December 13, 1989 London concert version of Candide conducted by the composer (for which she later shared an award for Best Classical Album at the 34th annual Grammy Awards (1992), given for the December 1989 Abbey Road Studios recording by the same cast and conductor). Twelve days later, again with Bernstein, she appeared in Berlin for a Christmas Day performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor \\"Choral\\" at the Schauspielhaus, celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall. The December 25, 1989 concert was broadcast live in more than twenty countries to an estimated audience of 100 million people, and was performed by an orchestra and chorus made up of many nationalities: from Germany, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, the Chorus of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, and members of the S√§chsische Staatskapelle Dresden; from the Soviet Union, members of the Orchestra of the Kirov Theatre, from the United Kingdom, members of the London Symphony Orchestra; from the USA, members of the New York Philharmonic, and from France, members of the Orchestre de Paris. =1990s= In the next decade, Anderson continued to pursue traditional bel canto roles, but also expanded her repertoire. Anderson began with a January 1990 performance of the Berlioz song cycle Les nuits d'√©t√© at Carnegie Hall, with Giuseppe Sinopoli conducting London's Philharmonia Orchestra. Later that year, she appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in an opulent production of Rossini's Semiramide, with Marilyn Horne and Samuel Ramey. In 1990, Anderson also performed in Pesaro in a production of the rarely seen Ricciardo e Zoraide, also by Rossini, and visited the Lyric Opera of Chicago in a new production of Lucia di Lammermoor directed by Andrei ≈ûerban. She closed 1990 with her New Year's Eve gala concert with Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic broadcast nationwide on Live from Lincoln Center on PBS. In February 1991, she returned to Carnegie Hall to perform La sonnambula with the Opera Orchestra of New York.Bernard Holland, Reviews/Music; June Anderson in 'La sonnambula', The New York Times, February 16, 1991 Also in 1991, she participated in the Gala celebrating the Silver Anniversary of the \\"new\\" house of Metropolitan Opera, performing \\"Je suis Titania\\" from Mignon, conducted by James Levine. She also sang with Pavarotti at a gala concert in Teatro Valli in Reggio Emilia, Italy to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his first stage appearance. In 1992, she created her first Elena in La donna del lago at La Scala, the house's first production of the opera in 150 years, staged to mark the bicentenary of Rossini's birth. That same year, she appeared in a controversial new production of Lucia di Lammermoor at the Metropolitan Opera staged by Francesca Zambello.Michael Walsh, Mad, Bad and Dangerous, Time (magazine), December 7, 1992 Edward Rothstein wrote in The New York Times: > [S]ome of the audience's outrage may have been due to the contrast between > the staging and the many musical virtues that survived in the performance, > which was the most complete version of the score ever presented at the Met. > June Anderson -- who must have had black-and-blue arms by the evening's end, > so often was she grabbed and tossed about -- sang Lucia with more and more > refined empathy as the opera proceeded....She delivered a mad scene that > combined virtuosic control with a lovely, haunting innocence.Edward > Rothstein, Review/Opera; Love Among the Ruins: the Met's New 'Lucia' , The > New York Times, November 21, 1992 The following year, Anderson appeared as Maria in Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa, in a concert performance at Carnegie Hall with the Opera Orchestra of New York. In 1993, she also appeared in Verdi's La traviata at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Of that performance, the Chicago Tribune critic wrote: > The show belongs, of course, to Violetta Valery. Anderson quite simply has > done nothing finer for Lyric Opera. She internalized every emotion of the > role with her usual intensity and conviction, from desperate gaiety to > startled joy at her first stirrings of love for Alfredo, right on through to > her deathbed scene, which tugged mightily at the heartstrings of even the > most jaded opera-goers Every dramatic gesture seemed careful thought out, > yet nothing appeared mannered or merely gratuitous. . . .[H]er fiorature > were uniformly true, she was able to project easily throughout the theater > even when singing softly (how beautifully she floated the bel canto line of > \\"Addio, del passato\\", giving us both verses of the aria), and she commanded > the audience's sympathy like the canny singing actress she is. Anderson's > Violetta lives up to the great Lyric tradition.John von Rhein, Chicago > Tribune, September 20, 1993 Anderson began 1995 by appearing in Paris with Roberto Alagna in another controversial production of Lucia di Lammermoor, staged by Andrei ≈ûerban and designed by William Dudley. While the International Herald Tribune noted that ≈ûerban and Dudley were greeted by a \\"chorus of boos\\", it wrote of Anderson's performance: > [T]here were nothing but cheers for the impressive cast. June Anderson is > surely the Lucia of the moment, and although she lent herself heroically to > the frenetic demands of the staging, she also sang the role with superb > possession of her vocal means and understanding of the psychological > subtext.David Stevens, International Herald Tribune, February 1, 1995 Later in 1995, Anderson returned to the Metropolitan Opera in La fille du r√©giment with Pavarotti, of which The New York Times wrote: > Ms. Anderson's take on Marie is a legitimate one. Winsome charm is at a > minimum; tomboy toughness takes over. The role is, of course, one of the > coloratura soprano's richest gold mines. Ms. Anderson takes its long series > of hurdles with courage, adventure and cool beauty of singing. Wearing a > uniform as well as she does is no small help to the evening.OPERA REVIEW; > Adopted Daughter Of an Entire Regiment, Bernard Holland, The New York Times, > November 6, 1995 After appearing as Desdemona in Rossini's Otello for many years, in 1995 Anderson debuted in the same role in Verdi's Otello in Los Angeles, opposite Pl√°cido Domingo. She also created her first Lucrezia in Verdi's I due Foscari at Covent Garden and ended the year with her debut as Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1996, Anderson portrayed Joan of Arc in Verdi's Giovanna d'Arco, both in concert versions in New York and Barcelona, and in a stage production at Covent Garden. She returned to Tchaikovsky in 1996, portraying her first Tatiana in Eugene Onegin in Tokyo. She also appeared in La Traviata, alongside the Italian tenor Salvatore Fisichella, in Tokyo that same year. She participated in the Gala celebrating James Levine's 25th Anniversary at the Metropolitan Opera, singing with Carlo Bergonzi and Ferruccio Furlanetto a selection from I Lombardi alla prima crociata, a work she recorded in its entirety with Levine, Luciano Pavarotti, Samuel Ramey and the Metropolitan Opera orchestra that same year. In 1997, Anderson made her first appearance in Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. The Chicago Tribune noted that Anderson's \\"clear, bright upper range was at its clarion best, the soprano singing with strength and nuanced sensitivity\\" and hailed her acting as well: \\"[D]ramatically, Anderson was exceptional, drawing out all of the conflicting emotions with an intensity tempered by dignity.\\"John von Rhein, Chicago Tribune, February 6, 1997. Later in 1997, she returned to the Opera Orchestra of New York to portray her first Elvira in Verdi's Ernani.Bernard Holland, Fast-Paced Derring-Do and a Love Quadrangle New York Times, April 8, 1997. In 1998, Anderson spoke in Opera News of her move away from light coloratura roles \\"into deeper water\\": > I wanted to put it off as long as possible. I kept saying, and it's been > quoted so many times, I didn't want to do \\"Normina.\\" I wanted to do Norma. > And Leonora. I didn't want to sound like a soubrette trying to do these > things. I've done things like Il Corsaro and La Battaglia di Legnano very > early in my career, so Verdi's always been a presence. I did mostly > Rigolettos and Traviatas, and then I added Desdemona a few years ago. ... So > I suppose Leonora would be next in line.\\"Opera News, February 14, 1998 Indeed, in 1998, Anderson played her first Leonora in Verdi's Il trovatore at the Metropolitan Opera, in a cast including Richard Margison and Dolora Zajick. =2000s= In recent years, Anderson has returned occasionally to her prior roles ‚Äì appearing in Lucia in S√£o Paulo in 2000 and Athens in 2002, La traviata at the Metropolitan Opera in 2001, and new productions of La sonnambula (Op√©ra de Marseille, 2004) and Maometto II (Bilbao, 2005). She continues to appear as Norma, in Parma in and Teatro Col√≥n 2001, and at the Op√©ra de Marseille and the Canadian Opera Company in 2006. Of that latter performance, Toronto's The Globe and Mail wrote: > Bel canto is a term too often bandied about, but it does mean what it says: > beautiful singing, but beautiful as distinct from merely pretty; beautiful > not only in its musical sensitivity and accuracy of pitch in the face of > extreme vocal challenges devised by the composer, but also in its > penetration and detailed communication of the emotions encompassed in the > music and drama. It was all this that June Anderson's Norma comprehended and > conveyed. . . . Anderson, [] also, as a bonus, looked the part: feminine, > classy and dignified. I doubt there's been a markedly better Norma since > Callas and Sutherland.Ken Winters, The Globe and Mail, March 31, 2006. The Toronto Star wrote of Anderson's portrayal in Norma: > [T]he title role is a jewel for any soprano diva's crown. . . .And how very > special that one of the great contemporary Normas, American soprano June > Anderson, is present to bring down the house. . . . Anderson, a late > addition to the cast, has a remarkable dramatic presence. . .

Anderson alone is worth the > price of admission.John Terauds, Toronto Star, March, 2006. Anderson continues to claim new territory as well, with debut performances in Donizetti's Anna Bolena (Pittsburgh 2000) and Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali (Monte Carlo 2004), The Bassarids by Hans Werner Henze (Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, 2005), Rossini's Il viaggio a Reims (Monte Carlo 2005), and the Richard Strauss operas Capriccio (Naples 2002) and Daphne (La Fenice 2005). Of her debut in Daphne a reviewer in Opera magazine wrote: > The performance seemed to me an absolute triumph for June Anderson. At a > career stage where she could reasonably be expected to scale down effort, > ambition and new projects, she has instead taken the admirable decision to > continue expanding her artistic range - as this first-ever Daphne (follow-up > to her recent first ever Capriccio Countess) demonstrated.... [T]he singing > offered countless ravishments: crystalline timbre, clean-cut line- > delineation, dead-on-target intonation, awesomely easy projection of one > perilously exposed high phrase after another.Max Loppert, Opera, November > 2005. In 2007, Anderson performed Verdi's Requiem in Paris with conductor Christoph Eschenbach and the Orchestre de Paris, Norma in Leipzig, and at galas at La Fenice in Venice (June 2007), and the Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Athens (July 2007) honoring the 30th anniversary of the death of Maria Callas. She appeared as Anna Bolena in Bilbao in October 2007, and ended the year with Verdi's Requiem in Manchester and at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. In January 2008, Anderson was elevated from \\"Officier\\" to \\"Commandeur\\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government, the highest level of commendation within the Ordre recognizing \\"eminent artists and writers, as well as individuals who have contributed to the recognition of French culture in the world.\\" Her 2008 schedule included recitals and concerts in Aix-en-Provence, Brussels, Bordeaux, Paris, a performance with conductor Kent Nagano and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, at the Bel Canto Festival in Qu√©bec, and a Christmas concert in Geneva. In 2009, Anderson appeared in the title roles of Norma at Teatro Verdi in Trieste, Italy (February - March 2009), and Lucrezia Borgia at Op√©ra Royal de Wallonie in Li√®ge, Belgium (June 2009). In the 2010-11 season, June Anderson added two new roles to her repertoire: Madame Lidoine, in Dialogues des Carmelites at the Op√©ra de Nice, and Salome (opera) at the Op√©ra Royal de Wallonie. Her 2012 schedule included a further role debut as Pat Nixon in John Adams' Nixon in China at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet.

He also wrote essays, worked as an editor, and was a publisher of short-lived newspapers and literary journals. He is best known for his novel The Blacker the Berry: A Novel of Negro Life (1929), which explores discrimination within the black community based on skin color, with lighter skin being more highly valued. Early life Thurman was born in Salt Lake City to Beulah and Oscar Thurman. When Thurman was less than a month old, his father abandoned his wife and son. It was not until Wallace was 30 years old that he met his father. Between his mother's many marriages, Wallace and his mother lived in Salt Lake City with Emma Jackson, his maternal grandmother. Jackson ran a saloon from her home, selling alcohol without a license.\\"Wallace Thurman\\", in Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance, ed. by Aberjhani & Sandra West, pp. 328‚Äì330 Thurman's early life was marked by loneliness, family instability and illness. He began grade school at age six in Boise, Idaho, but his poor health eventually led to a two-year absence from school, during which he returned to his grandmother Emma in Salt Lake City. From 1910 to 1914, Thurman lived in Chicago. Moving with his mother, he finished grammar school in Omaha, Nebraska.Singh & Scott. (2003), p. 3 During this time, he suffered from persistent heart attacks. While living in Pasadena, California in the winter of 1918, Thurman caught influenza during the worldwide Influenza Pandemic. He recovered and returned to Salt Lake City, where he finished high school. Thurman was a voracious reader. He enjoyed the works of Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Havelock Ellis, Flaubert, Charles Baudelaire and many others. He wrote his first novel at the age of 10. He attended the University of Utah from 1919 to 1920 as a pre- medical student. In 1922 he transferred to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, but left without earning a degree. While in Los Angeles, he met and befriended the writer Arna Bontemps, and became a reporter and columnist for a black-owned newspaper. He started a magazine, Outlet, intended to be a West Coast equivalent to The Crisis, operated by the NAACP. Career In 1925 Thurman moved to Harlem. During the next decade, he worked as a ghostwriter, a publisher, and editor, as well as writing novels, plays, and articles. In 1926, he became the editor of The Messenger, a socialist journal addressed to blacks. There he was the first to publish the adult- themed stories of Langston Hughes. Thurman left the journal in October 1926 to become the editor of World Tomorrow, which was owned by whites. The following month, he collaborated in founding the literary magazine Fire!! Devoted to the Younger Negro Artists. Among its contributors were Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Bruce Nugent, Aaron Douglas, and Gwendolyn B. Bennett. He was able to publish only one issue of Fire!!. It challenged such figures as W. E. B. Du Bois and African Americans who had been working for social equality and racial integration. Thurman criticized them for believing that black art should serve as propaganda for those ends. He said that the New Negro movement spent too much energy trying to show white Americans that blacks were respectable and not inferior. Thurman and others of the \\"Niggerati\\" (the deliberately ironic name he used for the young African American artists and intellectuals of the Harlem Renaissance) wanted to show the real lives of African Americans, both the good and the bad. Thurman believed that black artists should fully acknowledge and celebrate the arduous conditions of African American lives. As Singh and Scott wrote, > Thurman's Harlem Renaissance is, thus, staunch and revolutionary in its > commitment to individuality and critical objectivity: the black writer need > not pander to the aesthetic preferences of the black middle class, nor > should he or she write for an easy and patronizing white approval.Singh & > Scott (2003), pp. 19‚Äì20 During this time, Thurman's flat in a rooming house, at 267 West 136th Street in Harlem, became the central meeting place of African-American literary avant-garde and visual artists.Aberjhani and West (2003), Encyclopedia, p. 242 Thurman and Hurston mockingly called the room \\"Niggerati Manor.\\" He had painted the walls red and black, which were the colors he used on the cover of Fire!! Nugent painted murals on the walls, some of which contained homoerotic content. In 1928, Thurman was asked to edit a magazine called Harlem: A Forum of Negro Life; its contributors included Alain Locke, George Schuyler, and Alice Dunbar-Nelson. He put out only two issues. Afterward, Thurman became a reader for a major New York publishing company, the first African American to work in such a position. Personal life Thurman married Louise Thompson on August 22, 1928. The marriage lasted only six months. Thompson said that Wallace was a homosexual and refused to admit it. They had no children together.Rampersad (1986), vol. 1, p. 172. Quote: Louise Thompson said, \\"I never understood Wallace. He took nothing seriously. He laughed about everything. He would often threaten to commit suicide but you knew he would never do it. And he would never admit that he was a homosexual, but he was. Never, never, not to me at any rate.\\" Death Thurman died at the age of 32 from tuberculosis, which many suspect was exacerbated by his long fight with alcoholism. Thurman's writings Langston Hughes described Thurman as \\"...a strangely brilliant black boy, who had read everything and whose critical mind could find something wrong with everything he read.\\" Thurman's dark skin color attracted comment, including negative reactions from both black and white Americans. He used such colorism in his writings, attacking the black community's preference for its lighter-skinned members. Thurman wrote a play, Harlem, which debuted on Broadway in 1929 to mixed reviews. The same year his first novel The Blacker the Berry: A Novel of Negro Life (1929) was published. The novel is now recognized as a groundbreaking work of fiction because of its focus on intra-racial prejudice and colorism within the black community, where lighter skin has historically been favored. Three years later Thurman published Infants of the Spring (1932), a satire of the themes and the individuals of the Harlem Renaissance. He co-authored his final novel, The Interne (1932), with Abraham L. Furman, a white man.

These can include death of an occupant, murder, suicide, and belief that a house is haunted. Controversy exists regarding the definitions of stigma and what sorts of stigma must be disclosed at sale. It is argued that the seller has a duty to disclose any such history of the property. This, in practice, falls into two categories: demonstrable (physical) and emotional. Local jurisdictions vary widely in their interpretation of these issues and occasionally contradict federal law.  Types of stigma  Many jurisdictions recognize several forms of stigmatized property, and have passed resolutions or statutes to deal with them. One issue that separates them is disclosure. Depending on the jurisdiction of the house, the seller may not be required to disclose the full facts. Some specific types must always be disclosed, others are up to the jurisdiction, and still others up to the realtor. The types of stigma include: * Criminal stigma: the property was used in the ongoing commission of a crime. For example, a house is stigmatized if it has been used as a brothel, chop shop, or drug den. In the case of drug dens, some drug addicts may inadvertently come to the address expecting to purchase illegal drugs. Most jurisdictions require full disclosure of this sort of element. * Debt stigma: Debt collectors unaware that a debtor has moved out of a particular residence may continue their pursuit at the same location, resulting in harassment of innocent subsequent occupiers. This is particularly pronounced if the collection agency uses aggressive or illegal tactics. * Minimal stigma is known to, or taken seriously by, only a small select group, and such a stigma is unlikely to affect the ability to sell the property; in such a case, realtors may decide to disclose this information in a case-by- case basis. * Murder/suicide stigma: Some jurisdictions in the United States require property sellers to reveal if murder or suicide occurred on the premises. California state law does if the event occurred within the previous three years. To protect sellers from lawsuits, Florida state law does not require any notification. In North Carolina, sellers and agents do not have to volunteer information about the death of previous occupants, but a direct question must be answered truthfully. * Phenomena stigma: Many (but not all) jurisdictions require disclosure if a house is renowned for \\"haunting\\", ghost sightings, etc. This is in a separate category from public stigma, wherein the knowledge of \\"haunting\\" is restricted to a local market. Perceived paranormal activity is an indicator of a possible air quality hazard, such as carbon monoxide or toxic mold. * Public stigma: when the stigma is known to a wide selection of the population and any reasonable person can be expected to know of it. Examples include the Amityville Horror house and the home of the Menendez brothers. Public stigma must always be disclosed, in almost all American and European jurisdictions. Legal status At least in the United States, the principle of caveat emptor (\\"let the buyer beware\\") was held for many years to govern sales. As the idea of an implied warranty of habitability began to find purchase, however, issues like the stigma attached to a property based on acts, \\"haunting\\", or criminal activity began to make their way into legal precedents. In Stambovsky v. Ackley the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, affirmed a narrow interpretation of the idea of stigmatized property. The court held that since the property in question was previously marketed by the seller as a \\"haunted house\\" he was estopped from claiming the contrary. The majority opinion specifically noted that the veracity of the claims of paranormal activities were outside the purview of the opinion. Notwithstanding these conclusions, the court affirmed the dismissal of the fraudulent misrepresentation action and stated that the realtor was under no duty to disclose the haunting to potential buyers. A previous version of this article stated that serious illness (such as AIDS) is also a reason a property may become stigmatized, citing a Florida law that contradicts federal law. However, under federal fair-housing laws, persons with AIDS are considered handicapped and members of a protected class. The fact that an occupant of a property has AIDS does not require disclosure to a prospective buyer. Several states have created specific statutes in the US adding \\"stigmatised property\\" verbiage to their legal code.  Examples  Famous homes, such as those used in television productions or filmmaking, can also be stigmatized by increased traffic from fans wanting to see the house in person. One example is the house at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York where Ronald DeFeo, Jr. murdered his family, later made famous by best-selling book The Amityville Horror and numerous film adaptations. The Lutz family claimed the house was haunted by evil spirits who drove them out. Their claims are supported by paranormal investigators such as Ed and Lorraine Warren and Hans Holzer, but dismissed as fraudulent by skeptics such as Robert Carroll. Since the film's release, the house has been renovated and the address changed in an attempt to prevent sightseers from disturbing the neighborhood.

History Pupil teachers' centre 1909‚Äì1921 Brockenhurst College began its existence in 1909 as a pupil teachers' centre ‚Äì a school where girls from age 13 learned to be teachers. The classes were held in the Wesleyan Church Sunday School, with only 18 children attending under the head mistress, Miss Moore. Although classes were first held in the church Sunday school, Brockenhurst never had any religious affiliation or received any funding from ecclesiastical authorities. It was always funded by the Hampshire Education Authority, and the Sunday school room was used simply because it offered suitable accommodation. Between 1913 and 1935 the school moved location twice and changed head mistress to Miss Emma Clara Ward. During this time the school increased further with more problems continuing for teaching space. County school 1921‚Äì1939 Taking in both boys and girls, the school was still expanding further with more pupils joining, by now numbering 150. Along with this the education board granted more funding and further building work; this was followed by a new hall, kitchen and a woodwork room. Miss Ward died in October 1935 to be replaced by the former head of Farnborough Grammar School, Mr R H May. County High School 1939‚Äì1950 The school by this time had grown even further to a high school enrolling 400 students and as young as eleven. Grammar school 1950‚Äì1953 In 1950 the headmaster decided that the school should be turned into a grammar school and students would therefore have to pass the 11-plus to join. At this stage the school was still taking in both sexes and was resisting the change wanted by the local community. It was also at this time that the headmaster changed Brock's motto to what it is today without any warning to staff or pupils. The motto in the early 50s was \\"Manners Makyth Man\\", borrowed from Winchester College (the school song \\"Forty Years On\\" was borrowed from Harrow). The new motto \\"Inter Silvas Quaerere Verum\\" (Seek Truth [or Learning] Amongst the Trees), an adaptation from Horace's Epistles, refers to the school's location in the New Forest. In spite of the borrowings from boys' public schools it is said that Dr Wood, formerly of Bedales school, accepted the post of Headmaster only on the condition that Brockenhurst remained co-educational rather than becoming boys only as had been proposed. County High School (again) 1953‚Äì1960 In 1953 the headmaster made another unexpected decision changed the name back to a high school. The name remained for seven years until the Hampshire Education Authority sanctioned the change to a grammar school. Grammar School 1960‚Äì1970 Finally the name of grammar school remained for the following ten years after being reinstated by the Education Authority. College 1970‚Äì The school was converted into a sixth form college in 1969, leaving all the surrounding schools to continue lower school education in the area, and became a tertiary college in 1985.

Often a freestyler will need little more than a board and a smooth, flat surface. Music and choreography have always been an essential part of the professional freestyle routine.Skateboarding by Jackson Teller (Capstone, 2011) History =1950s and 1960s= Freestyle in the 1950s was created by members of the surfing culture who thought an alternative during times when conditions were not conducive to surfing‚Äîsurfers would imitate their water-based maneuvers on skateboards when ocean conditions were poor. In the 1960s, many freestyle tricks were derived from gymnastics and dancing.Freestyle Skateboarding Tricks: Flat Ground, Rails, Transitions by Sean D'arcy, Phillip Marshall (Firefly Books, 2010) =1970s and 1980s= The following two decades were defined by a progression towards technical, fluid, and more creative routines. Influential freestyle skateboarders of the 1970s and 1980s included Russ Howell, Rodney Mullen, Joe Humeres and Per Welinder. The style changed significantly in the 1980s, when ollies and ollie-based flip tricks were invented and introduced to the discipline, with Mullen playing a significant role in this process.Stalefish: Skateboard Culture from the Rejects Who Made It by Sean Mortimer (Chronicle Books, 2008) Organizations \\"California Amateur Skateboard League\\" was founded in 1982, by Frank Hawk with the help of two other \\"skater parents\\", Sonja Catalano & Jeanne Hoffmann.

In 1995, professional freestyle skateboarder Stefan \\"Lillis\\" √Ökesson started the International Network for Flatland Freestyle Skateboarding (INFFS) and, with Daniel Gesmer, produced Flatline and the online version Flatline Online. Following the inception of these initiatives, freestyle skateboarders connected and interacted on a global scale in a manner that had not been experienced previously. The World Freestyle Skateboard Association (WFSA) was then founded by Bob Staton, √Ökesson, and Gesmer in the year 2000, thereby attracting further interest in freestyle skateboarding.

The Front drew many of its members from amongst the officer class and veterans thereof, groups with which Borghese was already closely linked, and co-operated closely with the Stefano Delle Chiaie's Avanguardia Nazionale and Pino Rauti's Ordine Nuovo, even sharing members with both groups.Ferraresi, Threats to Democracy, p. 118 With a nationwide structure and a network of funding from business sources the Front soon had a few thousand members and even set up underground \\"B groups\\" to prepare the ground for an armed uprising. The Front's mission was fulfilled in the Golpe Borghese, a failed coup attempt launched in December 1970, with the group disappearing soon afterwards.

He was also a professional football player, actor and author.  Early life  =Childhood= Ernest Barnes Jr. was born during the Jim Crow era in \\"the bottom\\" community of Durham, North Carolina, near the Hayti District of the city. He had a younger brother, James (b. 1942), as well as a half-brother, Benjamin B. Rogers Jr. (1920‚Äì1970). Ernest Jr. was nicknamed \\"June\\". His father, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. ( ‚Äì1966), worked as a shipping clerk for Liggett Myers Tobacco Company. His mother, Fannie Mae Geer (1905‚Äì2004), oversaw the household staff for a prominent Durham attorney and local Board of Education member, Frank L. Fuller Jr. On days when Fannie allowed \\"June\\" (Barnes' nickname to family and childhood friends) to accompany her to work, Mr. Fuller encouraged him to peruse the art books and listen to classical music. The young Ernest was intrigued and captivated by the works of master artists. By the time Barnes entered the first grade, he was familiar with the works of such masters as Toulouse-Lautrec, Delacroix, Rubens and Michelangelo. When he entered junior high school, he could appreciate, as well as decode, many of the cherished masterpieces within the walls of mainstream museums ‚Äì although it would be many more years before he was allowed entrance because of segregation. A self-described chubby and unathletic child, Barnes was taunted and bullied by classmates. He continually sought refuge in his sketchbooks, finding the less-traveled parts of campus away from other students. One day Ernest was drawing in his notebook in a quiet area of the school. He was discovered hiding there by the masonry teacher, Tommy Tucker, who was also the weightlifting coach and a former athlete. He was intrigued with Barnes' drawings, so he asked the aspiring artist about his grades and goals. Tucker shared his own experience of how bodybuilding improved his strength and outlook on life. That one encounter would begin Barnes' discipline and dedication that would permeate his life. In his senior year at Hillside High School, Barnes became the captain of the football team and state champion in the shot put. = College education = Barnes attended racially segregated schools. In 1956 he graduated from Hillside High School with 26 athletic scholarship offers. Segregation prevented him from attending nearby Duke University or the University of North Carolina. His mother promised him a car if he lived at home so he attended the all-Black North Carolina College at Durham (formerly North Carolina College for Negroes, now North Carolina Central University). At North Carolina College he majored in art on a full athletic scholarship. His track coach was Dr. Leroy T. Walker. Barnes played the football positions of tackle and center at NCC. At age 18, on a college art class field trip to the newly desegregated North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, Barnes inquired where he could find \\"paintings by Negro artists\\". The docent responded, \\"Your people don't express themselves that way\\".\\"The Beauty of the Ghetto\\" catalogue, Grand Central Art Galleries, New York, 1990 \\"Artist Statement\\" 23 years later, in 1979, when Barnes returned to the museum for a solo exhibition, North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt attended. In 1990 Barnes was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by North Carolina Central University. In 1999 Barnes was bestowed \\"The University Award\\", the highest honor by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors.  Professional football  = Baltimore Colts (1959‚Äì60) = In December 1959 Barnes was drafted in the 10th round by the then-World Champion Baltimore Colts. He was originally selected in the 8th-round by the Washington Redskins, who renounced the pick minutes after discovering he was a Negro. Shortly after his 22nd birthday, while at the Colts training camp, Barnes was interviewed by N.P. Clark, sportswriter for the Baltimore News-Post newspaper. Until then Barnes was always known by his birth name, Ernest Barnes. But when Clark's article appeared on July 20, 1960, it referred to him as \\"Ernie Barnes,\\" which changed his name and life forever. = Titans of New York (1960) = Barnes was the last cut of the Colts' training camp. After Baltimore released Barnes, the newly formed Titans of New York immediately signed him because the team had first option on any player released within the league. Barnes loathed being on the Titans. He said, \\"(New York team organization) was a circus of ineptitude. The equipment was poor, the coaches not as knowledgeable as the ones in Baltimore. We were like a group of guys in the neighborhood who said let's pretend we're pros.\\" After their seventh game on October 9, 1960 at Jeppesen Stadium, his teammate Howard Glenn died. Barnes asked for his release two days later. The cause of Glenn's death was reported as a broken neck. However, Barnes and other teammates have long attributed it to heatstroke. In a later interview, Barnes said, \\"They never really said what he died of. (Coach) Sammy Baugh said he'd broken his neck in a game the Sunday before. But how could that be? How could he have hit in practice all week with a broken neck? What he died of, I think, was more like heat exhaustion. I told them I didn't want to play on a team like this.\\" = San Diego Chargers (1960‚Äì62) = Barnes decided to accept a previous offer from Coach Al Davis at the Los Angeles Chargers. Barnes joined their team at mid-season as a member of their taxi squad. The following season in 1961 the team moved to San Diego. It was there Barnes met teammate Jack Kemp, and the two men would share a very close lifelong friendship. 1961‚Äì62 San Diego Chargers #61 Offensive guard, 6' 3\\" 250 lbs.

During the off-seasons with the Chargers, Barnes was program director at San Diego's Southeast YMCA working with parolees from the California Youth Authority. He also worked as the Sports Editor for The Voice, a local San Diego newspaper, writing a weekly column called \\"A Matter of Sports.\\" Barnes also illustrated several articles for San Diego Magazine during the off-seasons in 1962 and 1963. Barnes' first television interview as a professional football player and artist was in 1962 on The Regis Philbin Show on KGTV in San Diego. It was Philbin's first talk show. They would see each other again 45 years later when Philbin attended the tribute to Barnes in New York City. = Denver Broncos (1963‚Äì64) = Midway through Barnes' second season with the Chargers, he was cut after a series of injuries. He was then signed to the Denver Broncos. Barnes was often fined by Denver Coach Jack Faulkner when caught sketching during team meetings. One of the sketches that he was fined $100 for sold years later for $1000. Many times during breaks, Barnes would run off the field onto the sideline to give his offensive line coach Red Miller the scraps of paper of his sketches and notes. \\"During a timeout you've got nothing to do ‚Äì you're not talking ‚Äì you're just trying to breathe, mostly. Nothing to take out that little pencil and write down what you saw. The shape of the linemen. The body language a defensive lineman would occupy... his posture... What I see when you pull. The reaction of the defense to your movement. The awareness of the lines within the movement, the pattern within the lines, the rhythm of movement. A couple of notes to me would denote an action... an image that I could instantly recreate in my mind. Some of those notes have been made into paintings. Quite a few, really.\\"1963‚Äì64 Denver Broncos, Offensive guard, 6' 3\\" 253 lbs. Courtesy of the Ernie Barnes Family Trust. On Barnes' 1964 Denver Broncos Topps football card he is shown wearing jersey #55 although he never played in that number. His jersey was #62. Barnes was called \\"Big Rembrandt\\" by his Denver teammates. Coincidentally, Barnes and Rembrandt share the same birthday. = Canadian Football League = In 1965, after his second season with the Broncos, Barnes signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Canada. In the final quarter of their last exhibition game, Barnes fractured his right foot, effectively ending his professional football career. = Retirement = Shortly after his final football game, Barnes went to the 1965 NFL owners meeting in Houston in hopes of becoming the league's official artist. There he was introduced to New York Jets owner Sonny Werblin, who was intrigued by Barnes and his art. He paid for Barnes to bring his paintings to New York City. Later they met at a gallery and unbeknownst to Barnes, three art critics were there to evaluate his paintings. They told Werblin that Barnes was \\"the most expressive painter of sports since George Bellows.\\" In what was one of the most unusual posts in the history of the NFL, Werblin retained Barnes as a salaried player, but positioned him in front of the canvas, rather than on the football field. Werblin told Barnes, \\"You have more value to the country as an artist than as a football player.\\"Resonance, The Company of Art (newsletter), 1996. Barnes' November 1966 debut solo exhibition, hosted by Werblin at the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City was critically acclaimed and all the paintings sold. In 1971 Barnes wrote a series of essays (illustrated with his own drawings) in the Gridiron newspaper titled \\"I Hate the Game I Love\\" (with Neil Amdur). These articles became the beginning manuscript of his autobiography, later-published in 1995 titled From Pads to Palette which chronicles his transition from professional football to his art career. In 1993 Barnes was selected to the \\"Black College Football 100th Year All-Time Team\\" by the Sheridan Broadcasting Network.  Artwork  Barnes credits his college art instructor Ed Wilson for laying the foundation for his development as an artist. Wilson was a sculptor who instructed Barnes to paint from his own life experiences. \\"He made me conscious of the fact that the artist who is useful to America is one who studies his own life and records it through the medium of art, manners and customs of his own experiences.\\" All his life, Barnes was ambivalent about his football experience. In interviews and in personal appearances, Barnes said he hated the violence and the physical torment of the sport. However, his years as an athlete gave him unique, in-depth observations. \\"(Wilson) told me to pay attention to what my body felt like in movement. Within that elongation, there's a feeling. And attitude and expression. I hate to think had I not played sports what my work would look like.\\"Interview, \\"Our World with Black Enterprise\\" Barnes sold his first painting \\"Slow Dance\\" at age 21 in 1959 for $90 to Boston Celtic Sam Jones. It was subsequently lost in a fire at Jones' home. Numerous artists have been influenced by Barnes' art and unique style. Accordingly, several copyright infringement lawsuits have been settled and are currently pending. = Framing = Ernie Barnes framed his paintings with distressed wood in homage to his father. In his 1995 autobiography, Barnes wrote of his father: ‚Äú... with so little education, he had worked so hard for us. His legacy to me was his effort, and that was plenty. He knew absolutely nothing about art.‚Äù Weeks before Ernie Barnes‚Äô first solo art exhibition in 1966, he was at the family home in Durham as his father lay in the hospital after suffering a stroke. He noticed the usually well-maintained white picketed fence had gone untended since his father‚Äôs illness. Days later, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. died. ‚ÄúI placed a painting against the fence and stood away and had a look. I was startled at the marriage between the old wood fence and the painting. It was perfect. In tribute, Daddy‚Äôs fence would hug all my paintings in a prestigious New York gallery. That would have made him smile.‚Äù = Eyes closed = A consistent and distinct feature in Barnes' work is the closed eyes of his subjects. \\"It was in 1971 when I conceived the idea of The Beauty of the Ghetto as an exhibition. And I showed it to some people who were Black to get a reaction. And from one (person) it was very negative. And when I began to express my points of view (to this) professional man, he resisted the notion. And as a result of his comments and his attitude I began to see, observe, how blind we are to one another's humanity. Blinded by a lot of things that have, perhaps, initiated feelings in that light. We don't see into the depths of our interconnection. The gifts, the strength and potential within other human beings. We stop at color quite often. So one of the things we have to be aware of is who we are in order to have the capacity to like others. But when you cannot visualize the offerings of another human being you're obviously not looking at the human being with open eyes.\\"Barnes, Ernie. Interview, \\"Personal Diaries\\" with Ed Gordon, BET, 1990 \\"We look upon each other and decide immediately: This person is black, so he must be... This person lives in poverty, so he must be...\\" = Jewish community influence = Moving to an all-Jewish neighborhood in Los Angeles known as the Fairfax District in 1971 was a major turning point in Barnes' life and art. \\"Fairfax enlivened me to everyday life themes,\\" he said, \\"and forced me to look at my life ‚Äì the way I had grown up, the customs within my community versus the customs in the Jewish community. Their customs were documented, ours were not. Because we were so clueless that our own culture had value and because of the phrase 'Black is Beautiful' had just come into fashion, Black people were just starting to appreciate themselves as a people. But when it was said, 'I'm Black and I'm Proud,' I said, 'proud of what?' And that question of 'proud of what' led to a series of paintings that became ‚ÄúThe Beauty of the Ghetto.'\\" = \\"The Beauty of the Ghetto\\" exhibition = In response to the 1960s \\"Black is beautiful\\" cultural movement and James Brown's 1968 \\"Say it Loud: I'm Black and I'm Proud\\" song, Barnes created The Beauty of the Ghetto exhibition of 35 paintings that toured major American cities from 1972 to 1979 hosted by dignitaries, professional athletes and celebrities. Of this exhibition, Barnes said, \\"I am providing a pictorial background for an understanding into the aesthetics of black America. It is not a plea to people to continue to live there (in the ghetto) but for those who feel trapped, it is...a challenge of how beautiful life can be.\\" When the exhibition was on view in 1974 at the Museum of African Art in Washington, DC, Rep. John Conyers stressed the important positive message of the exhibit in the Congressional Record. = Sports art = The Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee named Barnes \\"Sports Artist of the 1984 Olympic Games\\". LAOOC President Peter V. Ueberroth said Barnes and his art \\"captured the essence of the Olympics\\" and \\"portray the city's ethnic diversity, the power and emotion of sports competition, the singleness of purpose and hopes that go into the making of athletes the world over.\\" Barnes was commissioned to create five Olympic-themed paintings and serve as an official Olympic spokesman to encourage inner city youth. 1985: Barnes was named the first \\"Sports Artist of the Year\\" by the United States Sports Academy. 1987: Barnes created Fastbreak, a commissioned painting of the World Champion Los Angeles Lakers basketball team that included Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Kurt Rambis and Michael Cooper. 1996: Carolina Panthers football team owners Rosalind and Jerry Richardson (Barnes' former Colts teammate) commissioned Barnes to create the large painting Victory in Overtime (approximately 7 ft. x 14 ft.). It was unveiled before the team's 1996 inaugural season and hangs permanently in the owner's suite at the stadium. Richardson and Barnes were Baltimore Colts teammates briefly in 1960. 1996: To commemorate their 50th anniversary in 1996, the National Basketball Association commissioned Barnes to create a painting with the theme, \\"Where we were, where we are, and where we are going.\\" The painting, The Dream Unfolds hangs in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. A limited edition of lithographs were made, with the first 50 prints going to each of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. 2004: Barnes was named \\"America's Best Painter of Sports\\" by the American Sport Art Museum & Archives. Other notable sports commissions include paintings for the New Orleans Saints, Oakland Raiders and Boston Patriots football team owners. = \\"The Bench\\" painting = Shortly after Barnes was drafted by the Baltimore Colts, Barnes was invited to see their Colts' NFL Championship Game vs. the New York Giants at Memorial Stadium in Maryland on December 27, 1959. The Colts won 31‚Äì16 and Barnes was filled with layers of emotion after watching the game from the Colts' bench. At age 21, he had just signed his football contract and met his new teammates Johnny Unitas, Jim Parker, Lenny Moore, Art Donovan, Gino Marchetti, Alan Ameche and \\"Big Daddy\\" Lipscomb. After he returned home, without making any preliminary sketches, he went directly to a blank canvas to record his point of view. Using a palette knife, \\"painting in quick, direct movements hoping to capture the vision...before it evaporated,\\" Barnes said, he created \\"The Bench\\" in less than an hour. Throughout his life, The Bench remained in Barnes' possession, even taking it with him to all his football training camps and hiding it under his bed. It would be the only painting Barnes would never sell, despite many substantial offers, including a $25,000 bid at his first show in 1966. In 2014, Barnes' wife Bernie presented The Bench painting to the Pro Football Hall of Fame for their permanent collection in Canton, Ohio. = \\"The Sugar Shack\\" painting = Barnes created the painting The Sugar Shack in 1971. It gained international exposure when it was used on the Good Times television series and on the 1976 Marvin Gaye album I Want You. 190px According to Barnes, he created the original version of The Sugar Shack after reflecting upon his childhood, during which he was not \\"able to go to a dance.\\" In a 2008 interview, Barnes said, \\"The Sugar Shack is a recall of a childhood experience. It was the first time my innocence met with the sins of dance. The painting transmits rhythm so the experience is re- created in the person viewing it. To show that African-Americans utilize rhythm as a way of resolving physical tension.\\" The Sugar Shack has been known to art critics for embodying the style of art composition known as \\"Black Romantic,\\" which, according to Natalie Hopkinson of The Washington Post, is the \\"visual-art equivalent of the Chitlin' circuit.\\"Neal, Mark Anthony. Review: I Want You. PopMatters. Retrieved on October 26, 2010. When Barnes first created The Sugar Shack, he included his hometown radio station WSRC on a banner. (He incorrectly listed the frequency as 620, though it was actually 1410. Barnes confused what he used to hear WSRC's on-air personality Norfley Whitted saying \\"620 on your dial\\" when Whitted was at his former station WDNC in the early 1950s.) After Marvin Gaye asked him for permission to use the painting as an album cover, Barnes then augmented the painting by adding references that allude to Gaye's album, including banners hanging from the ceiling to promote the album's singles.Ritz (2003), pp. 2‚Äì3. During the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever anniversary television special on March 25, 1983, tribute was paid to The Sugar Shack with a dance interpretation of the painting. It was also during this telecast that Michael Jackson introduced his famous \\"moonwalk\\" dance. The original piece is currently owned by Eddie Murphy, and is on display at his home in Beverly Park, CA. A duplicate created by Barnes was created in 1976 on display at the California African American Museum (CAAM). = Music album covers = Barnes' work appears on the following album covers: * The Sugar Shack painting on Marvin Gaye's 1976 I Want You * The Disco painting on self-titled 1978 Faith, Hope & Charity * Donald Byrd and 125th Street, NYC painting on self-titled 1979 album * Late Night DJ painting on Curtis Mayfield's 1980 Something to Believe In * The Maestro painting on The Crusaders' 1984 Ghetto Blaster * Head Over Heels painting on The Crusaders' 1986 The Good and Bad Times * In Rapture painting on B.B.

Courtesy of the Ernie Barnes Family Trust. 1992: In the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Mayor Tom Bradley used Barnes' painting Growth Through Limits as an inspirational billboard in the inner-city. Barnes contributed $1,000 to the winner of a slogan contest among the city's junior high school students that best represented the painting. 1995: Barnes' work was included in the traveling group exhibition 20th Century Masterworks of African-American Artists II. 1998: Barnes' painting The Advocate was donated to the North Carolina Central University School of Law by a private collector. Barnes felt compelled to create the painting from his \\"concern with the just application of the law... the integrity of the legal process for all people, but especially those without resource or influence.\\"Artist Statement in Commemorative catalogue for \\"The Advocate,\\" May 7, 1998. Retrieved October 2010 With \\"In Remembrance\\" painting. Courtesy of the Ernie Barnes Family Trust. 2001: While watching the tragic events of 9/11, Barnes created the painting In Remembrance. It was formally unveiled at the Seattle Art Museum. It was later acquired on behalf of the City of Philadelphia and donated to its African American Museum. A limited number of gicl√©e prints were sold with 100% of the proceeds going to the Hero Scholarship Fund, which provides college tuition and expenses to children of Pennsylvania police and fire personnel killed in the line of duty. 2005: Three of Barnes' original paintings were exhibited at London's Whitechapel Gallery in the 2005 Back to Black: Art, Cinema & Racial Imaginary art exhibition. 2005: Kanye West commissioned Barnes to create a painting to depict his life-changing experience following his near-fatal car crash. A Life Restored measures 9 ft. x 10 ft. In the center of the painting is a large angel reaching out to a much smaller figure of West. October 2007: Barnes' final public exhibition. The National Football League and Time Warner sponsored A Tribute to Artist and NFL Alumni Ernie Barnes in New York City. At the time of his passing, Barnes had been working on an exhibition Liberating Humanity From Within which featured a majority of paintings he created in the last few years of his life. Plans are under way for the exhibition to travel throughout the country and abroad. Television and movies Barnes appeared on a 1967 episode of the game show To Tell the Truth. The panelists correctly guessed Barnes was the professional football player-turned-artist. Barnes played Deke Coleman in the 1969 motion picture Number One, which stars Charlton Heston and Jessica Walter. Barnes played Dr. Penfield in the 1971 movie Doctors' Wives, which starred Dyan Cannon, Richard Crenna, Gene Hackman and Carroll O'Connor. In 1971 Barnes, along with Mike Henry, created the Super Comedy Bowl, a variety show CBS television special which showcased pro athletes with celebrities such as John Wayne, Frank Gifford, Alex Karras, Joe Namath, Jack Lemmon, Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett and Tony Curtis. A second special aired in 1972. Throughout the Good Times television series (1974‚Äì79) most of the paintings by the character J.J. are works by Ernie Barnes. However a few images, including \\"Black Jesus\\" in the first season (1974), were not painted by Barnes. The Sugar Shack made its debut on the show's fourth season (1976‚Äì77) during the opening and closing credits. In the fifth season (1977‚Äì78) The Sugar Shack was only used in the closing credits for five early episodes during that season. In the sixth season (1978‚Äì79), The Sugar Shack was only used in opening credits for the first eight episodes and in the closing credits for five early episodes during that season. In the fifth and sixth seasons (1977‚Äì79), The Sugar Shack appears in the background of the Evans family apartment. Barnes had a bit part on two episodes of Good Times: The Houseguest (February 18, 1975) and Sweet Daddy Williams (January 20, 1976). Barnes' artwork was also used on many television series, including Columbo, The White Shadow, Dream On, The Hughleys, The Wayans Bros., Wife Swap, and Soul Food, and in the movies Drumline and Boyz n the Hood. In 1981 Barnes played baseball catcher Josh Gibson of the Negro League in the television movie Don't Look Back: The Story of Leroy ‚ÄòSatchel' Paige with Lou Gossett Jr. playing Paige. The 2016 film Southside with You (about Barack and Michelle Obama's first date) prominently features Barnes' work in an early scene where the two characters visit an art exhibition.  Death  Barnes passed away on Monday evening, April 27, 2009 at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California from myeloid leukemia. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in two places: at his hometown Durham, North Carolina, near the site of where his family home once stood, and at the beach in Carmel, California, one of his favorite cities.  Posthumous Recognition  Ernie Barnes was recognized as a Main Honoree by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019. The posthumous recognition was bestowed upon 29 individuals \\"whose dedication, accomplishments and passion have helped shape Durham in important ways.\\"  Notes   References       External links  * Category:1938 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Durham, North Carolina Category:Players of American football from North Carolina Category:North Carolina Central Eagles football players Category:North Carolina Central University alumni Category:New York Titans (AFL) players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Denver Broncos (AFL) players Category:Denver Broncos players Category:American Football League players Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:African-American artists Category:Deaths from cancer in California ","title":"Ernie Barnes"},{"id":"2136816","text":"Emblem used by the YCV. YCV uniform jacket, c. 1912-14 The Young Citizen Volunteers of Ireland, or Young Citizen Volunteers (YCV) for short, was an Irish civic organisation founded in Belfast in 1912. It was established to bridge the gap for 18 to 25 year olds between membership of youth organisations‚Äîsuch as the Boys' Brigade and Boy Scouts‚Äîand the period of responsible adulthood. Another impetus for its creation was the failure of the British government to extend the legislation for the Territorial Force‚Äîintroduced in 1908‚Äîto Ireland. It was hoped that the War Office would absorb the YCV into the Territorial Force, however such offers were dismissed. Not until the outbreak of World War I did the YCV‚Äîby then a battalion of the UVF‚Äîbecome part of the British Army as the 14th Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles. The YCV was launched in Belfast City Hall on 10 September 1912 at a meeting chaired by the Lord Mayor, Robert James McMordie, who became its first president. The ideals of the YCV at its onset was stated as being \\"non- sectarian\\" and \\"non-political\\", and despite its leadership and membership being largely drawn from unionist families it included prominent Belfast nationalist Francis Joseph Biggar as part of its committee. The creation of the YCV had nothing to do with the Home Rule Crisis or Ulster Day on 28 September 1912, which saw the signing of the anti-Home Rule Ulster Covenant. However, by May 1914 the YCV‚Äîdespite some controversy‚Äîmerged with the anti- Home Rule Ulster Volunteer Force. Despite its name implying that it covered the whole of Ireland it never extended outside of Belfast, however there were plans to set up battalions in places such as counties Londonderry and Fermanagh. The YCV's name would later be resurrected by the YCV youth movement attached to the 1966 Ulster Volunteer Force (also UVF). Although there is no direct continuity between the two groups, they share the same emblem of a shamrock surmounted by a Red Hand of Ulster.Adrian Forty, Susanne K√ºchle, The Art of Forgetting, Berg 2001, p. 181 Establishment The YCV had its origins in the Belfast Citizens Association, a conservative ratepayers group.Timothy Bowman, Carson's Army: The Ulster Volunteer Force, 1910-22, Manchester University Press, 2007, p. 25 The YCV had its first meeting just prior to the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant (Ulster), opposing Home Rule, in Belfast City Hall on 10 September 1912.Thomas Bartlett & Keith Jeffery, A Military History of Ireland, Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 383 The group was inaugurated by Robert James McMordie in his role as Lord Mayor of Belfast and was led by Frederick Crawford. Other leading figures in the group's foundation included Councillor Frank Workman and foundry owner James Mackie. The group initially struggled to attract a Commanding Officer before eventually appointing Colonel R Spencer Chichester, a strongly right-wing Unionist who favoured purchasing guns for the YCV. Although officially called the YCV of Ireland it had no members beyond Belfast.Bowman, Carson's Army, p. 24 Each member was to pay 2s.6d (12.5 p) on joining the YCV and a further 6d (2.5p) each month as well as instalments on a ¬£1.10s fee for purchase of their grey uniform.Bowman, Carson's Army, p. 28 he was to attend weekly drills to learn \\"modified military and police drill, single stick, rifle and baton exercises, signalling, knot-tying and other such exercises\\". If possible, he was also to gain some knowledge of \\"life-saving and ambulance work\\". The constitution of the YCV insisted that members should not take part in any political meeting or demonstration, or wear their YCV uniforms at such events. They were stated as being \\"non-sectarian and non-political\\" and their objectives were considered to be: :\\"..... to develop the spirit of responsible citizenship and municipal patriotism by means of lectures and discussions on civic matters.... to cultivate, by means of modified military and police drill, a manly physique, with habits of self control, self-respect and chivalry....to assist as an organization, when called upon, the civil power in the maintenance of peace\\".Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Poolbeg, 1997, p. 49 Membership was open to anyone aged between eighteen and thirty-five who was over five feet in height and could present \\"credentials of good character\\". Some Roman Catholics did join the YCV, though it was overwhelmingly Protestant in numbers.Bowman, Carson's Army, p. 65 Made up mainly of middle class members, the YCV was patterned after the Scout movement, albeit for young men who were too old for that group, as well as the Boys' Brigade and Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade.Bowman, Carson's Army, p. 26 The group was formed in part because the Territorial Force had not been extended to Ireland and members wanted a substitute.Andrew Totten, The Tenth: A Century of Scouting at the 10th Belfast, 10th Belfast Scout Group, 2009, p. 13 The foundation of the YCV was hailed by the Northern Whig, a Unionist daily paper, although the Irish News, a nationalist paper, was less enthusiastic, speculating that the YCV had been set up as an organised strike-breaking force, with memories of the 1907 Belfast Dock strike still fresh.Bowman, Carson's Army, pp. 26-27 Merger with the Ulster Volunteers The anti-Home Rule Ulster Volunteer Force was created in January 1913 and there is evidence of co-operation between them and the YCV including the Larne gun-running. As the Home Rule crisis escalated, pressure grew for the YCV to become part of the UVF, and such a proposal was made in March 1914. This caused a degree of controversy and division amongst its membership, even with those who were members of both organisations who sought for the YCV to remain non-political. The 1st Battalion YCV went ahead and merged with the UVF, leading to a resolution being proposed and seconded at a YCV council meeting declaring regret that they were not consulted beforehand and that the 1st Battalion had no authority to proceed. Some members of the YCV resigned because of the merger, however the majority didn't and on 17 May 1914 it ceased to be an independent organisation becoming a battalion of the UVF. At the time of the merger the YCV had around 400 Catholic members who drifted from the movement rather than switch to the Protestant UVF.Bowman, Carson's Army, p. 31 Financial problems From soon after its inception the YCV faced financial problems as it tried and failed to solicit donations from major local businesses. By early 1914 the situation had become so dire that Frank Workman, a wealthy industrialist who was a partner in Workman and Clark ship builders, was paying for the upkeep of the group out of his own pocket.Bowman, Carson's Army, p. 29 Despite Chichester's attempts to fully militarise the group, the British government refused to offer financial assistance to the YCV, in return for placing themselves at the government's disposal. First World War Cap badge, 14th Battalion (YCV) Royal Irish Rifles, 1914 The Ulster Volunteers were most closely associated with the 36th (Ulster) Division during the First World War and the YCV as a unit formed the 14th Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles, which was part of the 36th.Totten, The Tenth, p. 16 The Battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Chichester, who addressed the soldiers as \\"young citizens\\", and wore the grey uniform of the YCV, although the group's 750 members were augmented by troops from mainland Britain (who made up 25% of the 14th) and the rest of Ireland (17%).Timothy Bowman, Irish Regiments in the Great War: Discipline And Morale, Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 65 A large group of English conscripts in the Battalion were nicknamed the \\"Gawd Blimey Brigade\\" by the original Belfast members, many of whom came from middle and upper-class families and looked down on the more rough and ready English soldiers.Bowman, Irish Regiments, p. 143 The more well off origins of the YCV members saw the Battalion itself acquire the nickname \\"Young Chocolate Soldiers\\".Andrew Totten, Straight & ready: a history of the 10th Belfast Scout Group 1908-1988, 10th Belfast Scout Group, 1989, p. 14 The group mutinied twice in 1915, first in June when soldiers drilling at Shane's Castle near Randalstown refused to march back to barracks, insisting that a train be sent to carry them instead. Chichester acceded to this demand.Bowman, Irish Regiments, p. 85 This was followed in September when the group mutinied over the cancellation of leave as part of a wider mutiny within the 36th. The mutiny in the 14th was defused however by a \\"Major B\\" who convinced the soldiers to abandon their plans.Bowman, Irish Regiments, pp. 85-86 Soon after this they were attached to the 12th Brigade following a reorganisation of the Ulster forces.Bowman, Irish Regiments, p. 114 By 1917, the 14th was generally seen as one of the poorer combat units of the Ulster Division.Bowman, Irish Regiments, p. 204 A letter by Major General Oliver Nugent to the Adjutant General in December 1917 described them as \\"totally wanting in any military spirit\\" and stated that \\"the Brigadier says he cannot trust them and I know that he is right [as] they are poor stuff either as workers or fighters and have been a constant source of anxiety during the past three weeks\\".Bowman, Irish Regiments, p. 146 The group was disbanded in early 1918 as part of a wider reduction in size for the 36th (Ulster) Division.Bowman, Irish Regiments, p. 145 Post-war Plans were made in 1919 to revive the YCV under the patronage of James Johnston, the serving Mayor of Belfast. Edward Carson however had little enthusiasm and suggested they contact the British authorities at Dublin Castle for their opinion. When this line of contact was ignored the plan was abandoned and the YCV did not return.Bowman, Carson's Army, p. 183 The name was revived in 1972 for a separate group with no direct connection to the original.

He is most well known for the design of the Forney type locomotive. Locomotives that he designed served the elevated railroads of New York City for many years before that system converted to electric power. One example of a Forney 0-4-4T locomotive built in 1902 by Baldwin Locomotive Works has been restored for daily operations on the Disneyland Railroad in Anaheim, California, as the railroad's number 5, Ward Kimball. An 0-4-4T Forney type built in 1886 by SLM for Finnish State Railways. Forney was born March 28, 1835 in Hanover, Pennsylvania. He apprenticed with another prominent locomotive builder, Ross Winans, before joining the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) as a draftsman in 1855. He left the B&O; in 1858, then worked for the Illinois Central Railroad from about 1861 to 1864. In that position, he patented an 0-4-4T locomotive that was the first of the \\"Forney\\" types of locomotives, characterized by the truck (US) or bogie (UK) under the coal bunker/water tank. In 1865 Forney changed employers again, this time to the Hinkley Locomotive Works, where he stayed until 1870. At that time, he started working as an associate editor for Railroad Gazette and quickly earned a reputation as an expert in steam locomotive theory. In late 1886, he bought the rival publication American Railroad Journal, as well as Van Nostrand's Engineering Magazine.

The sardine run of southern Africa occurs from May through July when billions of sardines ‚Äì or more specifically the Southern African pilchard Sardinops sagax ‚Äì spawn in the cool waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along the east coast of South Africa. Their sheer numbers create a feeding frenzy along the coastline. The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the Indian Ocean. In terms of biomass, researchers estimate the sardine run could rival East Africa's great wildebeest migration.Marine Scientists Scratch Heads Over Sardines. Reuters. August 30, 2004 However, little is known of the phenomenon. It is believed that the water temperature has to drop below 21 ¬∞C in order for the migration to take place. In 2003, the sardines failed to 'run' for the third time in 23 years. While 2005 saw a good run, 2006 marked another non-run.Sardine Run The shoals are often more than 7 km long, 1.5 km wide and 30 metres deep and are clearly visible from spotter planes or from the surface. Sardines group together when they are threatened. This instinctual behaviour is a defence mechanism, as lone individuals are more likely to be eaten than large groups. Causes Netting a shoal of sardines (dark patch in the water) The sardine run is still poorly understood from an ecological point of view. There have been various hypotheses, sometimes contradictory, that try to explain why and how the run occurs. A recent interpretation of the causes is that the sardine run is most likely a seasonal reproductive migration of a genetically distinct subpopulation of sardine that moves along the coast from the eastern Agulhas Bank to the coast of KwaZulu- Natal in most years if not in every year. The migration is restricted to the inshore waters by the preference of sardine for cooler water and the strong and warm offshore Agulhas Current, which flows in the opposite direction to the migration, and is strongest just off the continental shelf. A band of cooler coastal water and the occurrence of Natal Pulses and break-away eddies make it possible for sardine shoals to overcome their habitat constraints. The importance of these enabling factors is greatest where the continental shelf is narrowest. The presence of eggs off the KwaZulu-Natal coast suggests that sardine stay there for several months and their return migration during late winter to spring is nearly always unnoticeable because it probably occurs at depths where the water is cooler than at the surface. In some years there does not appear to be a sardine run. This may be because it is not detected by coastal observers either because it actually does not occur due to high water temperatures and/or other hydrographic barriers, or the migration may occur farther offshore and possibly deeper due to unusual conditions. Oceanographic influences Sardine prefer water temperatures between 14 and 20 ¬∞C. Each southern winter the nearshore sea temperature along the South African south east coast drops to within this range. Along the KwaZulu-Natal coast, sardine may be found in water warmer than 20 ¬∞C. It was hypothesized that factors beside temperature may influence the movement of sardine along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, One of these factors may be predation pressure. =Oceanographic regions of the KwaZulu-Natal coast= The KwaZulu-Natal coast includes varied oceanographic regions, each influenced by distinct environmental forces. *The continental shelf waters of the KwaZulu-Natal Mid to Lower South coasts are dominated by the warm Agulhas Current which flows toward the south west. This water has a mean winter temperature of 23 ¬∞C and the current speed is often more than 1 m/s within 5 km of the coast. *The Agulhas Current follows a very constant path. The main stream is just offshore of the continental shelf break most of the time, which suggests that conditions are normally unsuitable for sardines along that part of the coast. *Local winds do not appear to have much effect on the currents. *Sardine move closer to shore as they travel northwards along the coast, but it is not known whether this is due to environmental conditions or biological conditions. *There is a persistent cyclonic gyre known as the Durban Eddy, where warm Agulhas Current water flows onto the shelf and the resulting inshore current direction is from south to north. This section of coast may be considered a transition from the wind-dominated section of the continental shelf to the north, to the Agulhas Current dominated section of shelf to the south. *The North Coast section of continental shelf is considerably wider (>40 km) than that of the south coast (roughly 15 km). This causes the Agulhas Current to flow farther offshore, and current conditions over the shelf are more variable. Wind appears to be a dominant influence in the region. Longshore north-easterly or south-westerly winds precede currents of similar direction by roughly 18 hours. Sea temperature is often lower and nutrients higher than along the South Coast. *The North Coast would seem to be more suitable habitat for sardine, but it is not known to what extent they use it. These distinct regions may affect sardine distribution and movement. =Oceanographic variables and sardine presence= Some oceanographic variables have been found useful for describing conditions influencing sardine presence. *Water temperature has an inverse and highly significant influence. This is consistent with the preferred temperature range of sardine. *Sea currents have a significant effect, with calm current conditions most favourable for sardine presence and moderate current speeds from north to south most detrimental. As sardine movement during the run is northwards, this counter-current effect is expected. Other conditions associated with sardine presence are: *Increasing atmospheric pressure: sardine presence appears to be higher during periods between the cold fronts along the KwaZulu-Natal coast. These periods have calm atmospheric conditions and slow nearshore currents. *Large swells and low water clarity associated with cold fronts have a negative effect on sardine presence. *Wind direction, wind speed, current direction, air temperature and rainfall all significantly affect sea surface temperature and consequently sardine presence. *Current and wind direction effects dominated, with north- easterly wind and currents from north to south resulting in cooler sea surface temperatures. *North-easterly winds cause the surface water layer to move away from shore (Ekman veering), allowing the cool water to reach the surface, and south-westerly winds push warm Agulhas Current surface water towards the shore causing inshore temperatures to increase, which would negatively impact upon sardine presence. *Increasing maximum air temperature, south-easterly (onshore) winds, wind speeds in excess of 6 m/s, and rainfall, all result in warmer sea surface temperatures. *Strong south-easterly winds and rainfall are associated with the passage of frontal systems, which would push warm surface waters shoreward resulting in warmer sea surface temperatures. *Frequent light north-westerly land breezes: When north-westerly land breezes are the strongest winds of the day they have a cooling effect on sea surface temperature. This cooling should be greatest in the vicinity of the surf zone where mixing is most effective. Sardine are often sighted close inshore during early mornings, suggesting that they could be attracted by cooler conditions found there. Summary: Oceanographic predictors of sardine presence Favourable: *Decreasing sea surface temperature *Calm current conditions *Light north-westerly land breezes *Stable atmospheric conditions. Unfavourable: *Increasing sea surface temperature *Moderate north to south currents *Large swells *Turbid water North-easterly and north-westerly winds and north to south currents have a cooling effect upon nearshore sea surface temperatures, but south-easterly winds and increasing air temperatures cause nearshore sea surface temperature warming.  Predators  Dolphins (estimated as being up to 18,000 in number, mostly the common dolphin (Delphinus capensis)) are largely responsible for rounding up the sardines into bait balls. These bait balls can be 10‚Äì20 metres in diameter and extend to a depth of 10 metres. The bait balls are short lived and seldom last longer than 10 minutes. Once the sardines are rounded up, sharks (primarily the bronze whaler), and birds (like the Cape gannet), and Bryde's whales take advantage of the opportunity. Other whale species, regardless of whether they do or not join the run, may appear in the vicinity such as humpback, southern right, and minke whales.Smith D.. 2017\\\\.

Retrieved on October 01, 2017 =Predators as predictors of sardine presence= The Cape gannet is the predator species most closely associated with sardine presence along the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coastline and is the most useful indicator of sardine run activity. Sharks and large gamefish presence is also strongly associated with sardine presence during the run, but as they are not as easily observed from the surface they are not as useful a predictor of sardine presence. The presence of common dolphins inshore along the east coast during winter is significantly associated with sardine presence, and the common dolphin can be considered the third most useful species for predicting sardine presence. The resident population of bottlenose dolphin does not appear to associate with the sardine run, whereas the migrant stock does. This may explain why the bottlenose dolphin is less likely to predict sardine presence. =Record of predators= 2005 records: In June and July 2005 the avian and mammal predators included Bryde‚Äôs whale (Balaenoptera edeni), African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), Cape cormorant (Phalacrocorax capensis), which were predominantly found in the cooler southern part of the region. Peak sardine run activity occurred within 4 km of shore at the northward limit of a strip of cool water (<21 ¬∞C) stretching along the East Coast. The principal predators at this stage were common dolphins (Delphinus capensis) and Cape gannets (Morus capensis). Economic importance Sardines caught off Amanzimtoti, South Africa =Tourism= The recent interest in the sardine run has had significant impact on the local economy. International and domestic divers join local tour operators on sardine run diving expeditions. Such expeditions run from Eastern Cape towns, including East London, Port Saint Johns, and Port Elizabeth. The run has become important to tourism and is considered to be one of the main attractions in KwaZulu-Natal during the winter holiday period. Both local and international tourists are attracted to the spectacle and are provided with opportunities to participate in activities such as dive charters and boat based predator viewing tours. The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board and East Coast Radio, facilitate a ‚ÄòSardine Run Hotline‚Äô, which provides information on the position and movement of sardine shoals. Information is also provided on the internet. The Sardine Run Association (www.thesardinerunassociation.org) has been formed to provide a link between tour operator s, tourists, non-governmental organisations, scientists, and local and national governments. =Fishery= The sardine run also supports a small-scale, seasonal beach seine fishery. History The oldest known record of the run is a mention in the Natal Mercury newspaper of 4 August 1853. More recently, the run has been the subject of natural history documentaries (e.g., the BBC‚Äôs Nature's Great Events) and printed popular media (e.g., National Geographic). = The 2011 run = Pilot shoals were netted at Hibberdene on 20 June 2011, while the main shoal was sighted near Port St. Johns. Small pockets of sardines were seen between Mfazazana and Margate. About 25 crates of sardines were hauled out from the first netting at Hibberdene. A further 33 crates of sardines were netted and were sold at R700 per crate or R30 per dozen sardines. The 58 crates were sold \\"within minutes\\".Krishna, C. Upper Coast Fever: The sardines are finally here! Early arrivals netted on local beaches, June 24, 2011. An attempt was also made to net sardines at Banana Beach. About 500 common dolphins and numerous sharks were noted near Margate. Shark nets had been removed between Umgababa and Port Edward.Padayachee, K. The Mercury: First Trickle of Sardines Netted, June 21, 2011. Sardines were netted at Park Rynie on 21 June 2011. Some large nets of 200‚Äì300 baskets of sardines were taken. The baskets sold at R600 each. A large gathering of sardine predators was seen off Port Grosvenor on the Wild Coast. Thousands of Cape gannets and dolphins were seen in a continuous line of about 6 km between Brazen Head and just north of the Umtata River. It is suspected that this year's shoal is \\"massive\\", and will produce a \\"bumper run\\". Shark nets have been removed to the south of Durban. The first shoals were expected to reach Amanzimtoti on 23 June 2011.Langa, L. The Mercury: Bumper sardine run could be just around the corner, June 22, 2011.

On 22 June 2011, a \\"few\\" baskets were netted at Umgababa beach, and a \\"handful\\" of baskets were netted at Warner Beach in the afternoon. Sardines were also netted at Isipingo, where 14 baskets were hauled out. The sardines therefore reached the Amanzimtoti area a day earlier than predicted.South Coast Sun: Early sardine surprise on Upper South Coast, June 24, 2011. Rough seas (with waves up to 4.7 m) caused by strong winds associated with a cold front kept the sardines from the shore on 23 June 2011. Pockets of sardines were seen far out to sea off the Bluff. The rough water and far distance of the sardines from shore made it impossible for the fish to be netted. No dolphin or bird activity was seen in the Durban area associated with the sardines. The main shoal was still suspected to be off the Eastern Cape coastline,Daily News: Feeling Swell, June 23, 2011 with a report of some sardines still seen near Port St Johns on 22 and 23 June 2011.Shane's Fishing Blog: Sardine Run 2011, retrieved 24 June 2011. Durban beaches were the scene of most netting activity on 27 June 2011. \\"Hundreds of baskets\\" of sardines were hauled onto the beaches in 13 nets. The price per basket was R350 in the morning, but later in the afternoon the price had dropped to R120 per basket.The Mercury: Rich Bounty, June 28, 2011. Each net contained in excess of 300 baskets of sardines, with one net containing around 500 baskets.The Citizen: Sardine run at fever pitch off South Coast, 29 June 2011. Sardines were also netted at Umhlanga, Port Shepstone, Margate, Umgababa, and Port Edward. Cape gannets and other seabirds were seen \\"plunging from considerable heights\\" to catch the sardines, especially on the South Coast.Daily News: Sardines all along the coastline, June 27, 2011. Most of the sardines were netted along the Durban beaches as this was the area of calmest waters; swells along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline were around 2.5 m.Daily News: Swells drop and sardines are there!, June 28, 2011 Shark nets had been removed from Salt Rock to Port Edward, and bathers were requested to consult with lifeguards before entering the water. Meanwhile, a baby dolphin washed up on the beach at Scottburgh, with a gash behind its \\"flipper\\" (the photo showed a gash between the dorsal fin and the tail) that exposed the spine. The \\"weeks old\\" dolphin was taken to a nearby paddling pool, but authorities later euthanased it due to the severity of the injuries.Upper Coast Fever: Little Lost Stranger, July 1, 2011. Speculation was that the dolphin had been injured by a shark, or by a boat propeller; possibly related to the sardine run. Swells dropped to 1‚Äì1.5 m on 28 June 2011, allowing more netting of sardines. Sardines were netted at Amanzimtoti; on the main beach and at Chain Rocks. A 22-year-old American marine biology student (research diver) named Paulo Edward Stanchi was attacked by a large dusky shark while diving at Aliwal Shoal Marine Protected Area. The group of divers had encountered a pocket of sardines when a 3 m long dusky shark bit Mr Stanchi on his left leg and hands. Mr Stanchi managed to free himself from the shark, and was treated on the diving boat before being transported to Rocky Bay, where medics stabilised him. He was then airlifted to Nkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital, where he underwent surgery. Dusky sharks generally live offshore, but come closer to the shore during the sardine run. The annual sardine run allowed more dusky sharks in the Aliwal Shoal MPA than usual, but there was no reason for them to show any more interest in divers than usual. Mr Stanchi had been wearing split fins with black and grey stripes, and this may have looked like a small shoal of fish to the shark.South Coast Sun: Shark attacks diver off Aliwal Shoal, July 1, 2011.Sampson, B. The Citizen: Family to visit US shark Attack victim, 30 June 2011 Meanwhile, a woman in her 40s broke her leg in the frenzy at Amanzimtoti when the sardines were netted. The woman is believed to have been trying to get some of the sardines when she \\"stepped wrong\\" and fractured her leg. Paramedics stabilized her before transporting her to hospital.South Coast Sun: Sardine frenzy sees woman break her leg, July 1, 2011. 5 July 2011 was a \\"quiet day\\" for the sardine run. \\"Plenty of birds\\" were seen diving at Karridene close to the shore. 50 crates of sardines were taken at Umgababa in the early afternoon, while a net of sardines pulled in at Karridene contained some Garrick. More Garrick were caught by fishermen at Karridene, but in general there was little other game fish activity. There was reported to be a \\"massive shoal\\" of sardines off Coffee Bay in the Eastern Cape.Daily News: Quiet Day disappoints anglers, but main shoal on its way, July 6, 2011. On 15 July 2011, 100 baskets were netted at Pennington. It was difficult to predict the sardines' movements as they were staying offshore.Waterworth, T. The Independent on Saturday: Fishing Tragedy Averted, 16 July 2011. On 20 July 2011, 300 baskets of sardines were netted at Pennington in the morning. There were many gannets off Ballito, and \\"quite a bit of fish\\" between Park Rynie and Mtwalume.Medley, L. Daily News: Sardine surges almost at an end, July 20, 2011 A strong cold front hit South Africa towards the end of July, causing land surface temperatures to drop below 10 ¬∞C over much of the country.IOL News: Cold front hits SA: http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/cold-front-hits-sa-1.1108277, retrieved 23 August 2011. Heavy snow falls were experienced in high lying areas, including Nottingham Road, Mooi River and Newcastle in the Midlands, while Van Reenen‚Äôs Pass was snowed in.The Ridge Online: Cold front hits Durban, retrieved 23 August 2011. The cold front caused swells of up to 4 meters on the KwaZulu-Natal coast and a 25 to 30 knot wind with rough sea conditions. A ship called the Phoenix ran aground at Salt Rock, Ballito on 26 July 2011 because of the rough conditions. This cold front may have put an end to the 2011 Sardine Run.

Global removals =\\"Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon\\" (Episode 38)= aired on TV Tokyo in Japan on December 16, 1997, at 6:30 pm Japan Standard Time. Eighteen and a half minutes into the episode, a scene in which Pikachu uses its Thunderbolt attack to stop vaccine missiles results in an explosion featuring rapid flashes of red and blue lights. Although red and blue flashes were shown earlier in the episode, a technique called \\"paka paka\\" made this scene especially intense; these flashes were extremely bright strobe lights, with blinks at a rate of about 12 Hz for about 5 seconds in almost fullscreen, and then for 2 seconds outright fullscreen. At this point, viewers complained of blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Seizures, blindness, convulsions, and lost consciousness were also reported. Japan's Fire Defense Agency reported a total of 685 viewers, 310 boys and 375 girls, were taken to hospitals by ambulances. Although many recovered during the ambulance trip, over 150 viewers were admitted to hospitals. Two people remained hospitalized for over two weeks. Others had seizures while watching news reports rebroadcasting clips of the scene. A fraction of the 685 children treated were diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy. News of the incident spread quickly through Japan. On December 17, the day after the broadcast, TV Tokyo issued an apology to the Japanese people, suspended the program, and said it would investigate the cause of the seizures. Officers acting on orders from the National Police Agency questioned the program's producers about its contents and production process. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare held an emergency meeting to discuss the case with experts and gather information from hospitals. The series exited the airwaves. Later studies showed that 5‚Äì10% of viewers had mild symptoms that did not need hospital treatment. Approximately 12,000 children reported mild symptoms of illness, but they more closely resembled symptoms of mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over three years found most viewers had no further seizures. Scientists believe the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli can cause altered consciousness. Although about 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this broadcast was unprecedented. After the airing of \\"Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon\\", the Pok√©mon anime took a four-month hiatus. The TV Tokyo red circle logo and the Chu! („ÉÅ„É•„ÉÉ!) text were removed from the Pok√©mon opening and ending credits, the lightning flash was removed from the Dare da? („Å†„Çå„Å†?, Who Is It?) segment, and the station only reran the first 37 episodes of Pok√©mon until it returned on April 16, 1998, when it aired \\"Pikachu's Goodbye\\", which was the only episode promoted during those months. After the hiatus, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday. The opening theme was redone, black screens showing various Pok√©mon in spotlights were broken up into four images per screen, and opening animation omitted the TV Tokyo logo and following text. The Dare da? („Å†„Çå„Å†?, Who Is It?) segment was redone, starting with a black screen without the lightning flash and continuing on the blue screen without the lightning flash. Before the incident, the opening showcased one Pok√©mon image per screen, ending with the TV Tokyo red circle logo and the Chu!

Broadcast in Japan on April 11, 1998, host Miyuki Yadama went over the circumstances of the program format and the on- screen advisories at the beginning of animated programs, as well as showing letters and fan drawings sent in by viewers, most of whom were concerned that the incident would lead to the anime's cancellation. After that episode aired, prior episodes with seizure-like effects were edited for rebroadcasting (especially the non-Japanese releases). Also, \\"Denn≈ç Senshin Porigon\\" was the fifth episode to be banned in South Korea due to lightning flashes. This was the 38th episode of the original Japanese series. =Unaired episodes= \\"Battle of the Quaking Island! Dojoach vs. Namazun!!\\" (Episode 377) In \\"Battle of the Quaking Island! Dojoach (Barboach) vs. Namazun (Whiscash)!!\\" Ash Ketchum has just finished the Mossdeep City Gym, and his next goal is the final Gym at Sootopolis City. Ash and his friends journey toward Jojo Island on the way and are caught in an earthquake caused by Whiscash. They then meet a Pok√©mon trainer named Ch≈çta. The episode was originally set to air in Japan on November 4, 2004, but was skipped due to the episode's similarities to the Ch≈´etsu earthquake on October 23, 2004. The episode was later postponed, but was skipped in rotation order and eventually discontinued. While most of the other episodes were either not dubbed for English-language release or taken out of English-language syndication rotations, this episode of Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation was the second episode not to air outside of Japan, and the first episode not to air in Japan. Since then the move Earthquake alongside similar moves such as Fissure and Magnitude have not been used in the anime. This was the 377th episode of the Pok√©mon anime series. \\"Team Rocket vs. Team Plasma!\\" (Episodes 682 and 683) The two-part episode \\"Team Rocket vs. Team Plasma!\\" was originally scheduled to be broadcast on March 17 and March 24, 2011. The Pok√©mon Smash episode on the week that would've followed by the first part was preempted from broadcast due to the news coverage of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, before being postponed due to the content of the episodes wherein Castelia City is destroyed. There were plans for the episodes to be broadcast at a later date, but the episode was never actually aired. Footage from this episode was later used in the episode \\"Meloetta and the Undersea Temple\\" which aired on September 27, 2012, as well as in \\"Strong Strategy Steals the Show\\", which aired on December 13, 2012. This was the 682nd episode and the 683rd episode of the Pok√©mon anime series. = Postponed episodes = \\"A Fishing Connoisseur in a Fishy Competition!\\" (Episode 696) The episode \\"A Fishing Connoisseur in a Fishy Competition!\\" was postponed from its original airdate of April 7, 2011, to June 23, 2011, due to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The episode was originally titled \\"Hiun City Fishing Competition! Fishing Sommelier Dent Appears!!\\" („Éí„Ç¶„É≥„Ç∑„ÉÜ„Ç£„ÅÆ„Å§„ÇäÂ§ß‰ºöÔºÅÈá£„Çä„ÇΩ„É†„É™„Ç®„Éª„Éá„É≥„ÉàÁôªÂ†¥!! Hiun Shiti no Tsuri Taikai! Tsuri Somurie Dento T≈çj≈ç!!), but to fit in with its new airdate, references to the setting of Castelia (Hiun) City were removed. This was the 696th episode of the Pok√©mon anime series. \\"An Undersea Place to Call Home!\\" (Episode 851) The episode \\"An Undersea Place to Call Home!\\", featuring Ash, Clemont, Serena, and Bonnie helping a Skrelp (Kuzumo) return to its family in a sunken cruise ship, was originally set to broadcast on April 24, 2014. However, the sinking of MV Sewol led to the episode being pulled from its timeslot with plans for a later broadcast which Japan did eventually see officially on November 20, 2014. It has had its world debut in South Korea on August 8, 2014 right after Episode 824 as originally planned. It also finally made its English debut on February 7, 2015, with the season 18 theme song \\"Be a Hero\\" Episodes 1110‚Äì1116 These seven episodes were postponed from their original air dates of April 26, May 3, May 10, May 17, May 24, May 31, and June 7, 2020, respectively due to the COVID-19 pandemic and replaced with reruns, but only six rerun episodes replacing six episodes 1110-1115 on April 26, May 3, May 10, May 17, May 24, and May 31, 2020. On June 7, 2020, the Pokemon anime resumed airing of new episodes, starting with episode 1110. Episodes removed outside of Asia These episodes were never aired outside of Asia (with one notable exception of Episode 18 in the United States), and some episodes were never aired in South Korea. = Episodes removed by 4Kids Entertainment = \\"Beauty and the Beach\\" (Episode 18) Screenshot of the episode \\"Beauty and the Beach\\" when James shows off his inflatable breasts, offending Misty. \\"Beauty and the Beach\\" is the 18th episode of the original Japanese series. It was the first episode to be originally skipped by 4Kids Entertainment upon the original American broadcast of the series until 2000. On June 24, 2000, an English- language version of the episode aired on Kids' WB as \\"Beauty and the Beach\\". In this episode, the female characters all enter a beauty contest. Team Rocket also enters, with James donning a suit with inflatable breasts. One scene of the episode involved James showing off his artificial breasts for humorous effect, taunting Misty by saying: \\"Maybe, one day when you're older, you'll have a chest like this!\\" In one scene, he puffs up his breasts to over twice their original size. When it was dubbed and aired in 2000, all scenes of James in a bikini (about 40 seconds) were edited. There were a number of other sexualized scenes, such as one in which Ash and Brock are stunned at the sight of Misty in a bikini and another in which an older man appears to be attracted to her. In addition, all Japanese text on signs, etc. remains intact in this episode, as opposed to other first-season episodes in which it was digitally replaced with English text. A continuity problem created with this episode's removal is due to a flashback in \\"Hypno's Naptime\\" Also, this episode marks the first time chronologically that Misty and Brock meet Gary and Delia. But during the rerun of \\"Hypno's Naptime\\" on Kids Station, the flashback was changed to \\"Pok√©mon, I Choose You!\\" \\"The Legend of Miniryu\\" (Episode 35) was the second episode to be skipped by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first episode that was never aired in any dubbed format. This was the 35th episode of the original Japanese series. The episode was skipped due to the frequent appearances of firearms throughout the episode. The absence of this episode lead to continuity problems, as Ash captured 29 Tauros in this episode, with a 30th Tauros coming from Brock using one of his Safari Balls. The Tauros appear in later episodes and are used in tournaments by Ash, and only one episode alludes to where they came from. \\"The Ice Cave!\\" (Episode 250) was the third episode to be skipped over by 4Kids Entertainment; if aired, the episode would have been part of Pok√©mon: Master Quest (season 5). This episode was likely skipped because of the appearance of the controversial Pok√©mon Jynx. This was the 252nd episode of the original Japanese series. Some people believed Jynx was a racial stereotype of Africans similar to those from The Story of Little Black Sambo because of its big pink lips and black skin, or that it looked like a blackface actress. Jynx was later re-edited and given purple skin instead in later episodes. = Episodes removed by the Pok√©mon Company International = \\"Satoshi and Nagetukesaru! A Touchdown of Friendship!!\\" (Episode 1005) \\"Satoshi (Ash Ketchum) and Nagetukesaru (Passimian)! A Touchdown of Friendship!!\\" is the 64th episode of the series Pocket Monsters Sun & Moon. It aired in Japan on March 1, 2018, but never aired in the United States. Although it was never explained why the episode was skipped over, some speculated that the face paint Ash used to disguise himself as a Passimian could resemble blackface. This was the 1,005th episode of the Pok√©mon anime series. Passimian had to wait until episode 1020, A Young Royal Flame Ignites! to be finally seen outside Japan and in the English dub for the first time, since that the banned episode was the first one in the original Japanese anime to show Passimian. Episodes temporarily withdrawn in the United States after September 11, 2001 These episodes were temporarily removed after the September 11 attacks for destruction of buildings, the name, and/or weapons in the episode. =\\"Tentacool and Tentacruel\\" (Episode 19)= This episode was temporarily removed from rotation after the September 11 attacks of 2001, mainly because of the similarities between the attacks and Tentacruel attacking the city. The character Nastina also used military-style weapons during the fight scenes in the episode. However, Tentacruel striking a building was not removed from the dub's opening theme, and the episode is still available on the home video and DVD markets. The episode was aired a month after the September 11 attacks, and was not aired in the US again until the series began airing on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. It was also not shown for a short time in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina as it portrays a city flooded underwater. =\\"The Tower of Terror\\" (Episode 23)= This episode was temporarily withdrawn after the September 11 attacks due to its title. It has since been aired in the regular episode rotation. The episode features Ash and his friends travelling to Lavender Town to catch a Ghost Pok√©mon in the Pok√©mon Tower. Ash Ketchum and his Pok√©mon, Pikachu, ‚Äòdied‚Äô during this episode and haunted his friends with the ghost type Pok√©mon Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar, before his spirit went back into his living body and came back to life. While the episode in question has no similarities to the September 11 attacks, the episode was likely pulled due to the title.

On June 20, 1864, the Third Italian War of Independence broke out and four groups of IRC volunteers were sent to Custoza. In 1872, the headquarters were moved to Rome, and a Central Committee was formed. Since then, the IRC has expanded its operations throughout the entire territory of the country, and has been deployed to face a growing array of activities and emergencies, starting with the Casamicciola earthquake of 1883.

Italian Red Cross vehicles bear special license plates.  7 Fundamental Principles  The 7 Fundamental Principles are the foundation of the Italian Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies: * Humanity: ¬´The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavours, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples.¬ª * Impartiality: ¬´It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It endeavours to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress.¬ª * Neutrality: ¬´In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.¬ª * Independence: ¬´The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement.¬ª * Voluntary service: ¬´It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain.¬ª * Unity: ¬´There can be only one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society in anyone country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory.¬ª * Universality: ¬´The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all Societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide.¬ªAn Italian Red Cross ambulance. Activities The Italian Red Cross is currently conducting the 2020 Strategy promoted by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The main aim of this project is to reach, during this decade, 6 objectives based on the analysis of the needs and vulnerabilities of the community. The 6 strategic objectives are the following: # Safeguard and protect health and life; # Encourage support and social inclusion; # Prepare the community and respond to emergencies and disasters; # Spread the International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the Fundamental Principles and the Humanitarian Values. Cooperate with the other members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement; # Promote youths development and a culture of active citizenship; # Operate with a capillary, efficient and conspicuous structure, treasuring the activity of volunteers. Components Since the 2012 reform, the Italian Red Cross is made up of three components: * Corpo Militare (Ausiliario delle Forze Armate) - Military Corps (Auxiliary of the Armed Forces) * Corpo delle Infermiere Volontarie (Ausiliarie delle Forze Armate) - Voluntary nurses (Auxiliary of the Armed Forces) * Volontari della Croce Rossa Italiana (Componente Civile) - Volunteers of the Italian Red Cross (Civilians) References External links 30px Official Italian Red Cross website (in Italian) Category:Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies Category:1863 establishments in Italy Category:Organizations established in 1863 Category:Medical and health organisations based in Italy ","title":"Italian Red Cross"},{"id":"2136863","title":"Alsager Town F.C."},{"id":"2136864","text":"Malualkon, or Malual Kon, is a small rural South Sudanese town.

He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1975. Life and career Jack Lawrence was born in Brooklyn, New York to an Orthodox Jewish family of modest means as the third of four sons. His parents Barney (Beryl) Schwartz and Fanny (Fruma) Goldman Schwartz were first cousins who had run away from their home in Belaya Tserkov (Bila Tserkva, Ukraine) to go to America in 1904. Lawrence wrote songs while still a child, but because of parental pressure after he graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School, he enrolled in the First Institute of Podiatry where he received a doctoral degree in 1932. The same year, his first song was published and he immediately decided to make a career of songwriting rather than podiatry. That song, \\"Play, Fiddle, Play\\", won international fame and he became a member of ASCAP that year at age 20. In the early 1940s, Lawrence and several fellow hitmakers formed a sensational review called \\"Songwriters on Parade\\", performing all across the Eastern seaboard on the Loew's and Keith circuits. Lawrence joined the United States Maritime Service during World War II and wrote the official song of the Maritime Service and Merchant Marine, \\"Heave Ho! My Lads, Heave Ho!\\" as a lieutenant in 1943, while bandleader at Sheepshead Bay Maritime Service Training Station in New York. One of Lawrence's first major songs after leaving the service was \\"Yes, My Darling Daughter\\", introduced by Dinah Shore on Eddie Cantor's radio program. The song was Shore's first record. His song \\"If I Didn't Care\\" introduced the world to The Ink Spots. And although Frank Sinatra was already a well-known big band singer, Lawrence's \\"All or Nothing at All\\" was Sinatra's first solo hit. In 1946, Lawrence published a song he had written during his tour of duty in World War II. It was released in February 1947 and eventually spent 2 weeks at #1. He wrote it for the then- five-year-old daughter of his attorney, Lee Eastman: Linda Eastman, future first wife of Beatle Paul McCartney. The song was called \\"Linda\\". Lawrence also wrote the lyrics for \\"Tenderly\\", Sarah Vaughan's first hit and Rosemary Clooney's trademark song (in collaboration with composer Walter Gross), as well as the English language lyrics to \\"Beyond the Sea\\" (based on Charles Trenet's French language song \\"La Mer\\"), Bobby Darin's signature song. Another French song for which Lawrence wrote English lyrics was \\"La Goualante de Pauvre Jean\\", becoming \\"The Poor People of Paris\\". Together with Richard Myers, Lawrence wrote \\"Hold My Hand\\", which was featured in the film Susan Slept Here and nominated for the 1954 Academy Award for Best Song. He also wrote the song Never Smile at a Crocodile.

Personal life Lawrence was a gay man and was open about his sexuality later in life. He was the longtime companion of Walter David Myden (birth surname Cohn or Cohen). Myden was born in Cooperstown, New York, in 1915 to Jewish parents who had immigrated from the Russian Empire, much like Lawrence's family. He and Lawrence met while serving in the United States Merchant Marines during World War II. Myden was a psychologist and a social worker at a Los Angeles community council. His UCLA dissertation was published in 1957, on the personalities of creative types, such as composers. In 1968, Lawrence and Myden made a sizable donation of 20th-century American art to the then-new American Pavilion of Art and Design at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The gift was noted in an interview with the couple in The New York Times that made clear that the two were a couple who lived together and were making the donation together, an unusual and brave admission for gay men in pre-Stonewall America.Glueck, Grace. \\"Next Year -- Or So -- In Jerusalem\\" The New York Times, September 22, 1968. www.nytimes.com.

The most frequent site of obstruction is the vesico-ureteric junction (VUJ), the narrowest point of the upper urinary tract. Acute obstruction and the resultant urinary stasis (disruption of urine flow) can distend the ureter (hydroureter) and cause a reflexive peristaltic smooth muscle spasm, which leads to a very intense visceral pain transmitted via the ureteric plexus.  Signs and symptoms  Renal colic typically begins in the flank and often radiates to below the ribs or the groin. It typically comes in waves due to ureteric peristalsis, but may be constant. It is often described as one of the most severe pains. ¬ß Background. Although this condition can be very painful, most ureteric stones under 5 mm size will eventually pass into the bladder without needing treatments, and cause no permanent physical damage. The experience is said to be traumatizing due to the severe pain, and the experience of passing blood and clots as well as pieces of stone. In most cases, people with renal colic are advised to drink more water to facilitate passing; in other instances, lithotripsy or endoscopic surgery may be needed. Preventive treatment can be instituted to minimize the likelihood of recurrence. Diagnosis  The diagnosis of renal colic is same as the diagnosis for the renal calculus and ureteric stones. = Differential diagnosis = The renal colic must be differentiated from the following conditions: * biliary colic and cholecystitis * aortic and iliac aneurysms (in older patients with left-side pain, hypertension or atherosclerosis) * interstitial: appendicitis, diverticulitis or peritonitis (in this case patients prefer to lie still rather than being restless) * gynaecological: endometriosis, ovarian torsion and ectopic pregnancy * testicular torsion Treatment Most small stones are passed spontaneously and only pain management is required. Above the rate of spontaneous stone passage decreases. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as diclofenac or ibuprofen, and antispasmodics like butylscopolamine are used. Although morphine may be administered to assist with emergency pain management, it is often not recommended as morphine is addictive and raises ureteral pressure, worsening the condition. Vomiting is also considered an important adverse effect of opioids, mainly with pethidine. Oral narcotic medications are also often used. There is typically no antalgic position for the patient (lying down on the non-aching side and applying a hot bottle or towel to the area affected may help). Larger stones may require surgical intervention for their removal, such as shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Patients can also be treated with alpha blockers in cases where the stone is located in the ureter.

Known as \\"the American Clausewitz,\\" and \\"the original nuclear strategist,\\" he was an initial architect of nuclear deterrence strategy and tried to ascertain the role and value of nuclear weapons after their creation. Brodie was initially a strong supporter of the concept of escalating responses; he promoted the view that a war in Europe would be started with conventional forces and escalate to nuclear only if and when necessary. After a meeting with French counterparts in 1960, he came to espouse a very different policy, one based purely on nuclear deterrence with the stated position that the US would use nuclear arms at the first instance of hostilities of any sort. Brodie felt that anything short of this seriously eroded the concept of deterrence and might lead to situations where one side might enter hostilities believing it could remain non-nuclear. This change in policy made Brodie increasingly at odds with his contemporaries. Life and career Born in Chicago, Bernard Brodie was the third of four sons of Max and Esther (Bloch) Brodie, immigrants from the Russian Empire. He graduated from the University of Chicago with a Ph.B in 1932, and received a Ph.D in 1940 under Jacob Viner. Brodie was an instructor at Dartmouth College from 1941 to '43. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Naval Reserve Bureau of Ordnance and at the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. He then taught at Yale University from 1945 to 1951, where he was a member of the Yale Institute of International Studies, and worked at the RAND Corporation as a senior staff member between 1951 and 1966. Brodie was a full professor and taught Political Science and International Relations at UCLA from 1966 until his death in 1978. He married Fawn McKay Brodie ‚Äì who became a well-known biographer of Richard Nixon, Joseph Smith, Thomas Jefferson and others ‚Äì on August 28, 1936. They were the parents of three children. Theories Initially a theorist about naval power, Brodie shifted his focus to nuclear strategy after the creation of the nuclear bomb. His most important work, written in 1946, was entitled The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order, which laid down the fundamentals of nuclear deterrence strategy. He saw the usefulness of the atomic bomb was not in its deployment but in the threat of its deployment. In a now famous passage he said \\"Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose.\\" In the early fifties, he shifted out of academia and began work at the RAND Corporation where a stable of important strategists, Herman Kahn and others, developed the rudiments of nuclear strategy and warfighting theory. While working at the RAND Corporation, Brodie wrote Strategy in the Missile Age (1959) which outlined the framework of deterrence. By arguing that preventative nuclear strikes would lead to escalation from limited to total war, Brodie concluded that deterrence through second strike capability would lead to a more secure outcome for both sides. Due to the virtual abandonment of first strike as a strategy, Brodie suggested investment in civil defense, which included the \\"hardening\\" of land based missile locations to ensure the strength of the second strike capability. The building of protected missile silos around the United States is a testament to this belief in second strike capability. It was also important for the second strike force to have first strike capabilities to provide the stasis necessary for deterrence.Brodie, Bernard. Strategy in the Missile Age. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1959, 277-278 Brodie believed that the second strike force should not be targeted towards cities but towards military installations. This was meant to give the Soviets an opportunity to limit escalation and allow the United States to win the war. Brodie also advocated the funding of conventional military personnel as a means of ensuring communist containment through limited wars or to fight total war if deterrence fails.Brodie, Bernard. Strategy in the Missile Age. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1959, 393-405 Brodie, who had a fascination with Freud and psychoanalysis, sometimes used it to refer to his work in nuclear strategy. In an internally circulated memorandum at the RAND Corporation, Brodie compared his no cities/withhold plan to coitus interruptus, while the SAC plan was like \\"going all the way\\". Following those comments, fellow RAND scholar Herman Kahn told an assembled group of SAC officers \\"Gentlemen, you don't have a war plan, you have a war orgasm!\\".Kaplan, Fred The Wizards of Armageddon. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1991, 222-223 Similar sexual imagery was liberally used in Stanley Kubrick's film Dr. Strangelove, a satire of Cold War nuclear strategy. Brodie was also responsible, along with Michael Howard and Peter Paret, for making the writings of Carl von Clausewitz more accessible to the English-speaking world. Brodie's incisive \\"A guide to the reading of On War\\" in the Princeton translation of 1976 corrected most of the misinterpretations of the Prussian's theory and provided students with an accurate synopsis of this vital work.

It premiered on ABC and ran for 44 episodes over two seasons from 1982 to 1983. It is the first cartoon based on a video game. Plot The show follows the adventures of the title character, Pac-Man, his wife Pepper Pac- Man (Ms. Pac-Man), their child Pac-Baby, their dog Chomp-Chomp and their cat Sour Puss. The family lives in Pac-Land, a place in which the geography and architecture seem to revolve primarily around sphere-like shapes. Most episodes of the series center around the ongoing battle between the Pac family and their only known enemies, the Ghost Monsters: Blinky, Inky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue. They work for Mezmaron, whose sole mission is to locate and control the source of \\"Power Pellets\\", which serve as the primary food and power source for the city, and also is the deus ex machina in virtually every episode. The second (and final) season later introduces Super-Pac and Pac- Man's teenage cousin P.J. Influence The show's initial success inspired ABC's rival CBS to create Saturday Supercade, which featured other video game characters from the golden age of video arcade games. Even some of the next Namco games were based on or influenced from the cartoon. Pac-Land and Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures are major examples. Also, the Tengen release of the original Pac-Man arcade game for the Nintendo Entertainment System features box art based on the cartoon.

He was the seventh Henry to rule Germany, but in order to avoid confusion with the Luxembourg emperor Henry VII, he is usually numbered Henry (VII).David Abulafia, Frederick II: A Medieval Emperor, (Oxford University Press, 1992), 229. Under custody Henry was born in Sicily, the only son of King Frederick II and his first wife, Constance of Aragon.Steven Runciman, The Sicilian Vespers, (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 26. He was the elder brother of Conrad IV, who eventually succeeded him as king. While Frederick sought to be elected German king against his Welf rival Otto IV, he had his new-born son crowned King of Sicily (as Henry II) by Pope Innocent III in March 1212,Welfs, Hohenstaufen and Habsburgs, Michael Toch, The New Cambridge Medieval History:c.1198-c.1300, Vol. 5, ed. David Abulafia, Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 381. since an agreement between Frederick and the Pope stated that the kingdoms of Germany and Sicily should not be united under one ruler. For this, the regency of the Sicilian kingdom went to his mother Constance and not to his father. However, after the death of the Pope in 1216, Frederick called his son to Germany, entrusted him with the Duchy of Swabia, Welfs, Hohenstaufen and Habsburgs, Michael Toch, 384. and again assumed the title of King of Sicily in 1217. Henry's mother remained as regent in Sicily, now on behalf of her husband, until 1220. After the extinction of the Swabian Z√§hringen line in 1219 Henry also received their title of a Rector of Burgundy, though that title disappeared when Henry was elected king. Henry's seal (dated 1216) shows him as a mounted knight with a shield and banner displaying three leopards (three lions passant guardant [or reguardant]) as the Hohenstaufen coat of arms; the three lions (later shown just passant) would later become known as the Swabian coat of arms. On 20/26 April 1220, the German princes assembled at Frankfurt elected Henry King of the Romans, for which the Emperor issued Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis, favoring the prince-bishops. The election had been a condition to Frederick II redeeming his Crusade promises of 1215, because the succession question, in case of the emperor's death on the crusade, was clarified by them. However, Pope Honorius III did not recognize the election and also deprived Henry of his rights over the Sicilian kingdom, because he (just as his predecessor) wanted to prevent the union of both countries. Also, numerous German princes had rejected the election in the first moment. After Frederick II returned to Italy in 1220, Henry was placed under the tutelage of Archbishop Engelbert I of Cologne, who crowned him German king on 8 May 1222, in Aachen. Despite the fact that Henry was formally betrothed to the P≈ôemyslid princess Agnes of Bohemia, Welfs, Hohenstaufen and Habsburgs, Michael Toch, 385. daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia, Engelbert planned his marriage with Isabella of England, one of the daughters of King John Lackland; however, this union never took place. After Engelbert's death in 1225, Duke Louis I of Bavaria took over the guardianship. The young King was mostly in the care of imperial ministeriales. They also acted as administrators over his Swabian duchy. In the meanwhile, the betrothal between Henry and the Bohemian princess was cancelled. In N√ºrnberg on 29 November 1225, by order of his father, Henry married Margaret of Babenberg, daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria, a woman seven years older than he was. Sixteen months later, on 23 March 1227, she was crowned German queen in Aachen. The marriage produced two sons, Henry and Frederick, who both died at a young age. Henry seems to have been a lively, cultured ruler and kept many Minnes√§nger at his court. It is possible he wrote some Minnelieder (courtly love poetry) himself. He was physically robust, although lame, and about 1.66 m (5' 4¬Ω\\") tall. Majority and rebellion against his father King Henry receives homage in W√ºrzburg in 1234, from the 16th-century Bishop's Chronicle by Lorenz Fries In 1228, he had a falling-out with Duke Louis of Bavaria, who was suspected of plotting with Pope Gregory IX against Emperor Frederick II. Around Christmas of that year, Henry took over the rule for himself, forced Louis to submit, and then turned against the Bishop of Stra√üburg. The German princes, angered by his city-friendly policies, forced him however to issue in Worms on 1 May 1231 the Statutum in favorem principum, directed against the cities, and by their complaints turned Frederick II against his son. The emperor was dependent on the support of the princes for his Italian policies against the Pope. Among other things which augmented the discord between father and son, Frederick lifted several regulations Henry had stipulated during his minority years to reduce his authority, and on the other side, the elevation of the Swabian count Egeno V of Urach, a staunch enemy of the Emperor, who became the most important of Henry's advisers. In 1232, Frederick came to terms with Pope Gregory, confirmed the Statutum, and had Henry swore obedience in Cividale. In the same year, Henry renewed the league between the Hohenstaufen and the French royal Capetian dynasty. In the following year he entered into a conflict with the House of Wittelsbach and subdued Otto II of the Palatinate, the son of Duke Louis of Bavaria. Frederick, fearing the discontent of the German princes, demanded the release of all hostages. In 1233/34, however, Henry made his father angry again, when he intervened against some inquisition measures, especially the Archbishop of Bremen's crusade against rebellious peasants of Stedingen. Pope Gregory IX, who had authorised the crusade, excommunicated Henry. Emperor Frederick outlawed his son on 5 July 1234 and announced his return to Germany. Henry revolted and in September formed an alliance with several German bishops and Swabian nobles. However, further negotiations with King Louis IX of France and the Lombard League failed. The princes adopted a wait-and-see stance, while Henry's forces were stuck in fights with the Lords of Hohenlohe, Margrave Herman V of Baden, and the City of Worms. Emperor Frederick, once he had entered Germany, soon gained a large following. When both sides met in Swabia, Henry was forced to submit to his father on 2 July 1235 at Wimpfen Castel, forsaken by most of his followers. Frederick II and the princes tried Henry on 4 July 1235 in Worms and dethroned him. His sons were deprived of the succession jointly with him. Henry's younger brother Conrad was appointed Duke of Swabia instead and also elected King of the Romans. Henry's allies were mostly pardoned. Frederick II reacted to the weakening of the royal power originated by his dispute with his son, among other things, with the diet in Mainz on 25 August 1235, which for first time passed a law on the public peace (German: Landfriedensgesetz) and fundamentally reformed the Regalia. Imprisonment and death Henry's death, 15th century depiction Henry was kept prisoner in various places, first in Heidelberg and Alerheim Castle, later in Apulia and at Rocca San Felice in Campania. His seclusion may have been dictated as much by his health as by his rebelliousness: analysis of his skeleton in 1998‚Äì1999 has shown that he was suffering from advanced leprosy in his last years. This was perhaps the real cause which prevented the emperor from forgiving him. Possibly on February 12 (according to other sources February 10), 1242 Henry died near Martirano in Calabria after a fall from his horse when he was moved there from Nicastro. Some chroniclers report that it had been an attempted suicide. His father had him buried with royal honours in the cathedral of Cosenza, in an antique Roman sarcophagus. Frederick, the only surviving son of Henry (VII), was named in the testament of his grandfather Frederick II, were the Emperor entrusted him with the Duchy of Austria, the Marquisate of Styria and 10,000 uncias. His death in 1251 was recorded by Matthew Paris, who claimed that both he and his older brother were poisoned (veneno interfecit).Matth√¶i Parisiensis Monachi Sancti Albani Chronica Majora, Vol. V, 1254, p. 448. Among the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, Henry is numbered only in parentheses, as he did not exercise the sole kingship. He is not to be confused with the later emperor Henry VII who actually ruled the Empire from 1308 onwards. Long time in his father's shadow and disparaged as \\"Parentheses Henry\\", several historians in recent years have adopted a more positive view of his Hohenstaufen policies.

He holds British, Canadian and American citizenship. Life and career Lionel Chetwynd was born to a Jewish family in Hackney, London, the son of Betty (n√©e Dion) and Peter Chetwynd.Lionel Chetwynd Film Reference biography His family moved to Canada when he was eight years old. Problems within his dysfunctional family led him to quit school at the age of 14. Chetwynd returned the following year but was promptly expelled. He then enlisted in the Canadian Army. After serving with The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, Chetwynd turned his life around. He walked into Sir George Williams University ‚Äî now Montreal's Concordia University ‚Äî and waited two hours to meet its principal, Henry F. Hall, who had a reputation for giving students a second chance. After a battery of tests, Chetwynd received conditional admittance as a mature student. Chetwynd became an honours student in philosophy and economics. He also championed Sir George Williams University on televised youth panels and in debating competitions. Shortly after graduating as valedictorian, Chetwynd married future Hollywood actor Gloria Carlin, whom he met at Sir George. He excelled to the point that he earned a scholarship to Montreal's McGill University Law School. At McGill law he served as a contributing editor for the McGill Law Journal. While a law student he also found employment at the beginning of preparations for the forthcoming Expo67, beginning as a laborer on the man-made islands. He quickly found a transfer to the Critical Path Section and then was moved into the Entertainment Branch. By January, 1967, three months before the opening of the fair, he had risen to a senior position within the E Branch with responsibility for approving all media licenses to the fair with the title Directeur de Reproduction, Terre des Hommes (Director of Reproduction, Man and World) After obtaining his degree, Chetwynd did graduate work in law in the United Kingdom at Trinity College, Oxford. After completing his studies, he remained in London, working for Columbia Pictures's distribution branch where he worked his way up to assistant managing director. Pursuing an interest in writing screenplays, after he met Canadian film director Ted Kotcheff, Chetwynd co-wrote the script for the film The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz with fellow Montrealer Mordecai Richler who had written the novel from which it was adapted. =1970s= With the script complete, Chetwynd moved to New York City, where the 1974 release of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz saw his career get a big boost when he won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium and a nomination for the Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay. In 1975 he wrote and produced Goldenrod starring his wife Gloria Carlin and Tony LoBianco, and in that same year wrote and produced Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye (A Christopher Award winner), the story of John Kennedy's first run for congress, based on the book by Dave Powers and Kenny O'Donnell. In 1977, he was hired by Marlo Thomas to pen a gender- reversal made-for-television version of It's a Wonderful Life entitled It Happened One Christmas, in which Thomas played the lead role portrayed by James Stewart in the original. Hired to write scripts for CBS (Love of Life) and PBS television networks, Chetwynd soon turned to directing his own screenplays, meeting with success for his 1978 film Two Solitudes. Adapted by Chetwynd from the Hugh MacLennan book, and starring Jean-Pierre Aumont, Stacy Keach, and Claude Jutra, the film dealt with societal issues relative to Canada's French and English speaking population and the Conscription Crisis of 1917. The film marked a turning point for Chetwynd and he would go on to write, direct, and produce numerous issue or event-based American films. A supporter of Ronald Reagan, Chetwynd's work, pronouncements, and endorsement of conservative ideologies, made him a favorite of the political right in the United States. =1980s= Chetwynd's diverse film works include productions such as the 1981 made for television story Miracle on Ice (Christopher Award) that recounted the U.S. ice hockey team's dramatic upset victory over the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Under the pen name Peter Dion, he scripted The Hot Touch for which he received a Canadian Genie nomination but which, sadly, was both the last film directed by Roger Vadim and the last film that included Melvin Douglas. A member of the National Sponsoring Committee of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Chetwynd wrote and directed the 1987 drama The Hanoi Hilton that dealt with the treatment of American P.O.W.s during the Vietnam War in Hanoi's notorious Hoa Lo prison. That year he was commissioned to create and write a special tribute to the United States Congress as part of the Constitutional Bicentennial celebration. In 1988, Chetwynd also wrote the four-hour miniseries for A&E; Television, To Heal a Nation(George Washington Medal), a biopic of Jan Scruggs, a Vietnam veteran who returned home disillusioned and disenchanted, later founding the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. He also wrote and helped produce the gala that celebrated the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution starring Ben Vereen, that was presented in Philadelphia before members of congress and the Supreme Court. His 1983 Sadat starring Lou Gossett, which was cited by the NAACP Image Awards, was the first OPT mini-series. He produced the Christopher Award-winning Evil in Clear River. =1990s= From 1992 to 1996 he executive produced, wrote, and frequently directed episodes of the PBS series Reverse Angle and its successor National Desk, public affairs series that earned multiple Telly Awards and a New York Festival Gold Medal. In 1993 he wrote Heroes of Desert Storm (directed by Don Ohlmeyer). Among his other issue-based works, Chetwynd wrote the screenplay and produced the Genie-nominated Kissinger and Nixon (1995), Color of Justice (1997) and wrote the scripts for Ruby Ridge: An American Tragedy, a four-hour miniseries for CBS, and The Man Who Captured Eichmann. In 1999 he wrote the teleplay for the ABC miniseries, Tom Clancy's Net Force. Chetwynd has also made biblical films, notably Jacob (1994), Joseph (1996 - Emmy winner, Best Miniseries) and Moses (1996), which was also nominated for an Emmy; the later two were both nominated for Emmys. =2000s= In 2001, Chetwynd wrote and directed Varian's War, the story of Varian Fry, an American who helped numerous intellectuals and artists escape from Nazi-occupied France during World War II. The film earned Chetwynd his fifth Writers Guild of American \\"Best Screenplay\\" nomination, as well as a special citation from The American Society of Yad Vashem and the Jewish Image Award for best film. In 2001, Chetwynd was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. In 2003, Chetwynd wrote and produced DC 9/11: Time of Crisis, a docudrama for Showtime Networks recounting the nine days in the Bush administration between the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon and the president's televised address to the nation before Congress. In 2002, Chetwynd wrote, produced and directed Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foreman Documents, a PBS documentary that recounted the life and career of American Communist Party member Carl Foreman. The story deals with events during McCarthyism that saw Foreman, a talented film producer and screenwriter, blacklisted by the Hollywood movie studio bosses in the 1950s. After Darkness at High Noon, he subsequently received an Emmy nomination for writing and producing Ike: Countdown to D-Day starring Tom Selleck, and wrote and produced the political documentary Celsius 41.11 and the historical film We Fight To Be Free. =2010s= Chetwynd continued his work in documentaries, notably producing and directing An Improbable Dream (2016) which traced the lives of students of Canada's National Ballet School from their 10th and 11th birthdays into their early 50s. It met with great success, receiving New York Festival Gold Medals for both directing and also producing, as well as a People's Telly Award. During this time he has worked on several other projects including a series for FX and a mini-series dealing with the end of the Cold War and the Armenian genocide. Chetwynd has more than 60 longform and feature credits and over two dozen documentary credits, which have received numerous citations including six Writers Guild of America nominations (including an award), New York Film festival Gold Medal, two Christophers, six Tellys, two Genie nominations and two George Washington medals from the Freedom Foundation at Valley Forge. In 2003, Chetwynd received the Caucus of Writers, Producers and Directors Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2011 he received their Writer of the Year award. In 2003 he was also conferred an honorary doctorate by Columbia College-Hollywood. In 2008, he received the John Singleton Copley Medal from the National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian. In 2004, Chetwynd became a founding member of Friends of Abe, an organization of Hollywood conservatives. Chetwynd appeared with Roger L. Simon, founder of Pajamas Media, in the internet's Pajamas TV's (PJTV) Poliwood show, discussing topics that cover the intersection of politics and Hollywood. =Personal life= Chetwynd is married to actress Gloria Carlin, who has appeared in several of his films. They have two sons and reside in Beverly Hills, California.

When a recruiter from the Mountain Rifle Regiment opened an office in Columbus in 1846, Green and a friend enlisted in the army. Green was promoted to sergeant at Newport, Kentucky, after one month of duty. Military career Green entered the army July 1, 1846. he fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War under General Winfield Scott as a first sergeant of the U.S. Mounted Rifles. He was discharged in August 1848, but he re-enlisted with the same regiment in September 1852. By the time the American Civil War began, Green was a first lieutenant of the 2nd Dragoons. On August 13, 1861 he was promoted to captain and served with the same regiment throughout the war, though it was renamed the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. He received a brevet promotion to major for service at the Battle of Gettysburg and to lieutenant colonel for service during the war. Green was promoted to major of the 1st Cavalry Regiment in June 1868, and fought against the Apaches in Arizona. He was in command at Fort Klamath, Oregon when the Modoc War began. He received the Medal of Honor during the First Battle of the Stronghold though the U.S. forces were defeated. Colonel Alvan C. Gillem, commanding officer of the 1st Cavalry, assumed command of the expedition against the Modocs. Green commanded a battalion of cavalry and infantry under Gillem during the Second Battle of the Stronghold in which U.S. forces succeeded in capturing Captain Jack's Stronghold. Green retired in 1889 after serving as commander of Fort Boise and alternately as commander of Fort Walla Walla. He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in 1890. =Earning the Medal of Honor= At the First Battle of the Stronghold during the Modoc War Green's men displayed a reluctance to fight Modoc warriors, who had been inflicting casualties on their unit. Green left cover, and, standing in full view of the Modoc warriors, proceeded to pace in front of his men, slapping his gloves in his palm for emphasis. Although exposed to enemy fire, Green survived, although he was injured, and remained in command. Medal of Honor citation Rank and Organization: Major, 1st U.S. Cavalry.

He has had an extensive and successful career both at club and international level. He led both Ajax and Feyenoord to Dutch championships and also had domestic success with Real Madrid. At international level, he led Trinidad and Tobago to the 2006 FIFA World Cup and Poland to UEFA Euro 2008, both firsts for each nation. His role in Spanish football has earned him the nickname Don Leo, largely due to his fondness of cigars and dry humour.  Coaching career  Beenhakker has been the coach of several prestigious clubs including Ajax, Feyenoord, Real Madrid, SC Veendam and Real Zaragoza. He has also coached the national teams of Saudi Arabia, Poland and the Netherlands. He coached the Trinidad and Tobago national team in the year leading up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Under Beenhakker's guidance, the team managed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, where the team secured a 0‚Äì0 draw against Sweden in their first match, and gave England cause for concern in the second match. From 2000 to 2003, Beenhakker was director of technical affairs with Ajax. In that period, he fired head coach Co Adriaanse and replaced him with Ronald Koeman. = Poland = On 11 July 2006, Beenhakker was appointed as the manager of the Poland national team. Originally, he was appointed to manage Poland until the end of UEFA Euro 2008, however his contract was extended until November 2009, the end of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup. On 17 November 2007, after Poland defeated Belgium 2‚Äì0, he managed to qualify Poland for the UEFA European Championship for their first time ‚Äì even in Poland's \\"golden years\\" of the 1970s and '80s, the nation never qualified for the Euro final stages. On 20 February 2008, Beenhakker was decorated with the Order of Polonia Restituta by President of Poland Lech Kaczy≈Ñski. The Order is conferred for outstanding achievements in the fields of education, science, sport, culture, art, economics, defense of the country, social work, civil service, or for furthering good relations between countries. However, after Poland's failure to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, Beenhakker was sacked.Poland dismiss coach Beenhakker =Feyenoord= While still in charge of Poland, Feyenoord hired Beenhakker on 5 May 2007 as an interim coach to lead the club through the 2006‚Äì07 play-offs. After his departure from Poland, he was named the sports director of the club, signing a contract on 9 October 2009 lasting until 30 June 2011.Feyenoord contrat√≥ a Leo Beenhakker como DT =√öjpest= Following his spell in the Netherlands, Beenhakker agreed on a three-year deal with Hungarian first division side √öjpest, and was officially introduced as the new sports director of the purple-whites in a press conference on 29 July 2011. As managing director Csaba Bartha revealed, Beenhakker's main duty was to work with the first team. However, the club also intended to use his diverse and extensive personal relationships to establish a scouting network across Europe, which could be used in both directions. His contract was terminated in October 2011, after Belgian businessman Roderick Duchatelet, son of Roland Duch√¢telet, purchased the club. Since November 2017, Beenhakker has been technical advisor at Sparta Rotterdam.  Languages  Beenhakker speaks several languages, including Dutch, English and Spanish. He also learned a few words in Polish during his time as national team manager.

Lips are soft, movable, and serve as the opening for food intake and in the articulation of sound and speech. Human lips are a tactile sensory organ, and can be an erogenous zone when used in kissing and other acts of intimacy.  Structure  Cupid's bow feature of a human lip The upper and lower lips are referred to as the \\"Labium superius oris\\" and \\"Labium inferius oris\\", respectively. The juncture where the lips meet the surrounding skin of the mouth area is the vermilion border, and the typically reddish area within the borders is called the vermilion zone. The vermilion border of the upper lip is known as the cupid's bow. The fleshy protuberance located in the center of the upper lip is a tubercle known by various terms including the procheilon (also spelled prochilon), the \\"tuberculum labii superioris\\", and the \\"labial tubercle\\". The vertical groove extending from the procheilon to the nasal septum is called the philtrum. Surface anatomy of the human lips The skin of the lip, with three to five cellular layers, is very thin compared to typical face skin, which has up to 16 layers. With light skin color, the lip skin contains fewer melanocytes (cells which produce melanin pigment, which give skin its color). Because of this, the blood vessels appear through the skin of the lips, which leads to their notable red coloring. With darker skin color this effect is less prominent, as in this case the skin of the lips contains more melanin and thus is visually darker. The skin of the lip forms the border between the exterior skin of the face, and the interior mucous membrane of the inside of the mouth. The lip skin is not hairy and does not have sweat glands. Therefore, it does not have the usual protection layer of sweat and body oils which keep the skin smooth, inhibit pathogens, and regulate warmth. For these reasons, the lips dry out faster and become chapped more easily. The lower lip is formed from the mandibular prominence, a branch of the first pharyngeal arch. The lower lip covers the anterior body of the mandible. It is lowered by the depressor labii inferioris muscle and the orbicularis oris borders it inferiorly. The upper lip covers the anterior surface of the body of the maxilla. Its upper half is of usual skin color and has a depression at its center, directly under the nasal septum, called the philtrum, which is Latin for \\"lower nose\\", while its lower half is a markedly different, red-colored skin tone more similar to the color of the inside of the mouth, and the term vermillion refers to the colored portion of either the upper or lower lip. It is raised by the levator labii superioris and is connected to the lower lip by the thin lining of the lip itself. Thinning of the vermilion of the upper lip and flattening of the philtrum are two of the facial characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome, a lifelong disability caused by the mother's consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. =Microanatomy = The skin of the lips is stratified squamous epithelium. The mucous membrane is represented by a large area in the sensory cortex, and is therefore highly sensitive. The Frenulum Labii Inferioris is the frenulum of the lower lip. The Frenulum Labii Superioris is the frenulum of the upper lip. =Nerve supply= Illustration of lips from Gray's Anatomy showing the inferior and superior labial arteries, the glands of the lips, and the nerves of the right side seen from the posterior surface after removal of the mucous membrane * Trigeminal nerve ** The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary branch. It supplies not only the upper lip but also much of the skin of the face between the upper lip and the lower eyelid, except for the bridge of the nose. ** The mental nerve is a branch of the mandibular branch ( via the inferior alveolar nerve). It supplies the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip and labial gingiva (gum) anteriorly. = Blood supply = The facial artery is one of the six non-terminal branches of the external carotid artery. This artery supplies both lips by its superior and inferior labial branches. Each of the two branches bifurcate and anastomose with their companion branch from the other terminal. = Muscles = The muscles acting on the lips are considered part of the muscles of facial expression. All muscles of facial expression are derived from the mesoderm of the second pharyngeal arch, and are therefore supplied (motor supply) by the nerve of the second pharyngeal arch, the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve). The muscles of facial expression are all specialized members of the panniculus carnosus, which attach to the dermis and so wrinkle, or dimple the overlying skin. Functionally, the muscles of facial expression are arranged in groups around the orbits, nose and mouth. The muscles acting on the lips: * Buccinator * Orbicularis oris (a complex of muscles, formerly thought to be a single sphincter or ring of muscle) * Anchor point for several muscles ** Modiolus * Lip elevation ** Levator labii superioris ** levator labii superioris alaeque nasi ** Levator anguli oris ** Zygomaticus minor ** Zygomaticus major * Lip depression ** Risorius ** Depressor anguli oris ** Depressor labii inferioris ** Mentalis  Functions  = Food intake = Breastfeeding Because they have their own muscles and bordering muscles, the lips are easily movable. Lips are used for eating functions, like holding food or to get it in the mouth. In addition, lips serve to close the mouth airtight shut, to hold food and drink inside, and to keep out unwanted objects. Through making a narrow funnel with the lips, the suction of the mouth is increased. This suction is essential for babies to breast feed. Lips can also be used to suck in other contexts, such as sucking on a straw to drink liquids. = Articulation = The lips serve for creating different sounds‚Äîmainly labial, bilabial, and labiodental consonant sounds as well as vowel rounding‚Äîand thus are an important part of the speech apparatus. The lips enable whistling and the performing of wind instruments such as the trumpet, clarinet, flute, and saxophone. People who have hearing loss may unconsciously or consciously lip read to understand speech without needing to perceive the actual sounds. = Tactile organ = The lip has many nerve endings and reacts as part of the tactile (touch) senses. Lips are very sensitive to touch, warmth, and cold. It is therefore an important aid for exploring unknown objects for babies and toddlers. = Erogenous zone = Lips of a young woman wearing red lipstick Lips of a young man Because of their high number of nerve endings, the lips are an erogenous zone. The lips therefore play a crucial role in kissing and other acts of intimacy. A woman's lips are also a visible expression of her fertility. In studies performed on the science of human attraction, psychologists have concluded that a woman's facial and sexual attractiveness is closely linked to the makeup of her hormones during puberty and development. Contrary to the effects of testosterone on a man's facial structure, the effects of a woman's oestrogen levels serve to maintain a relatively \\"childlike\\" and youthful facial structure during puberty and during final maturation. It has been shown that the more oestrogen a woman has, the larger her eyes and the fuller her lips, characteristics which are perceived as more feminine. Surveys performed by sexual psychologists have also found that universally, men find a woman's full lips to be more sexually attractive than lips that are less so. A woman's lips are therefore sexually attractive to males because they serve as a biological indicator of a woman's health and fertility. A woman's lipstick (or collagen lip enhancement) attempts to take advantage of this fact by creating the illusion that a woman has more oestrogen than she actually has, and thus that she is more fertile and attractive. Lip size is linked to sexual attraction in both men and women. Women are attracted to men with masculine lips, that are more middle size and not too big or too small; they are to be rugged and sensual. In general, the researchers found that a small nose, big eyes and voluptuous lips are sexually attractive both in men and women. The lips may temporarily swell during sexual arousal due to engorgement with blood. = Facial expression = The lips contribute substantially to facial expressions. The lips visibly express emotions such as a smile or frown, iconically by the curve of the lips forming an up-open or down-open parabola, respectively. Lips can also be made pouty when whining, or perky to be provocative.  Clinical significance As an organ of the body, the lip can be a focus of disease or show symptoms of a disease: * One of the most frequent changes of the lips is a blue coloring due to cyanosis; the blood contains less oxygen, and thus has a dark red to blue color, which shows through the thin skin. Cyanosis is the reason why corpses sometimes have blue lips. In cold weather cyanosis can appear, so especially in the winter, blue lips may not be an uncommon sight. * Inflammation of the lips is termed cheilitis. This can be in several forms such as chapped lips (dry, peeling lips), angular cheilitis (inflammation of the corners of the mouth), herpes labialis (cold sore, a form of herpes simplex) and actinic cheilitis (chronically sun damaged lips). cleft lip * Cleft lip is a type of birth defect that can be successfully treated with surgery. * Carcinoma (a malignant cancer that arises from epithelial cells) at the lips, is caused predominantly by using tobacco and overexposure of sunlight. Alcohol appears to increase the carcinoma risk associated with tobacco use. It is most often a diffuse and often hyperkeratinised lesion, occasionally has the form of nodules and grows infiltratively, and can also be a combination of the two types. It more often occurs at the lower lip, where it is also much more malign. The lower lip carcinoma is exclusively planocellular carcinoma, whereas at the upper lip, it can also be basocellular carcinoma.  Society and culture  Pierced lips Lips are often viewed as a symbol of sensuality and sexuality. This has many origins; above all, the lips are a very sensitive erogenous and tactile organ. Furthermore, in many cultures of the world, a woman's mouth and lips are veiled because of their representative association with the vulva, and because of their role as a woman's secondary sexual organ. As part of the mouth, the lips are also associated with the symbolism associated with the mouth as orifice by which food is taken in. The lips are also linked symbolically to neonatal psychology (see for example oral stage of the psychology according to Sigmund Freud). Lip piercing or lip augmentation is sometimes carried out for cosmetic reasons. Products designed for use on the lips include lipstick, lip gloss and lip balm. Other animals  This Asian arowana has large, protruding barbels In most vertebrates, the lips are relatively unimportant folds of tissue lying just outside the jaws. However, in mammals, they become much more prominent, being separated from the jaws by a deep cleft. They are also more mobile in mammals than in other groups, since it is only in this group that they have any attached muscles. In some teleost fish, the lips may be modified to carry sensitive barbels. In birds and turtles, the lips are hard and keratinous, forming a solid beak. Clevosaurids like Clevosaurus are notable for the presence of bone \\"lips\\"; in these species the tooth-like jaw projections common to all sphenodontians form a beak-like edge around the jaws, protecting the teeth within.Jones MEH (2009). \\"Dentary tooth shape in Sphenodon and its fossil relatives (Diapsida: Lepidosauria: Rhynchocephalia)\\".

Conquest of Elysium is a fantasy turn-based strategy game. The game can be played with up to eight human players. Single player against computer is possible. The game can run on very old computers and has support for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and Solaris. Game goal The goal of the game is the elimination of other players by either eliminating their commanders or capturing their citadels. In the start the player can choose whether he wants to create a random map or load a scenario. Random maps ask not only the size of the map and the amount of some terrain features but they also require the player the select the so-called society the map will be based on. The societies range from early human settlements to a crumbled central empire. The societies affect how many settlements there will be, what kind of non-player creatures threaten the players and what kind of general shape the map takes. For example, the \\"Monarchy\\" setting has independent castles surrounded by farms and minor settlements as a dominant feature. Characters Next choice is what character to play. There are nineteen different characters to play. The characters are split into Warlords, Magic users, Priests and Non-humans. The character is in practice the \\"nation\\" the player selects. Different characters have different strengths and require vastly different playstyles. Warlords have strong military units and occasionally some special features such as the ability to levy soldiers or construct watchtowers. Magic users gather some unique resource and their strength is in their summoned or constructed creatures. Priests differ greatly from each other but they have either need to capture civilized settlements, either for converts or blood sacrifices, in order to use their powers which are at best quite apocalyptic or they need to gather herbs or fungi and use them for summoning or spiritual attacks. The game map, made out of separate terrain tiles, is littered with different terrain types and locations such as old battlefields, settlements of varying size, mines and locations which can be used as additional citadels. Some locations have other uses for different player characters. Seasons change and affect the amount of money you get and how some spells work. Winter greatly reduces tax income and herbs and fungi don't grow. Game play The game is heavily combat oriented as the control of your nation is basically limited to buying units or changing the tax. Units are recruited centrally and are deployed into special structures called \\"citadels\\" which range from castles to wooden watchtowers. Large cities also double as citadels. The units cannot be moved without a commander who can command troops. Troops range from spearmen to siege engines and mythological and imaginary creatures of varying strength. Combat is handled in a separate combat mode: when two armies clash the game calculates combat results in the turn generation and the player gets to see the battles during the turn generation. The combat is completely automated and the player can only watch once the combat starts. The opposing armies line against each other. Some units have special abilities which come into play in combat. The combat's graphical presentation is simple: the only things displayed are the units on a black background and the possible walls protecting the defenders. Sound effects are few and simple as are spell effects. The game's interface is partially usable by both mouse and partially keyboard only. While this ensues that the game runs in truly minimally equipped computers it also makes the interface somewhat awkward to use. Despite being Illwinter's least known game they have continued to support it and latest patch was released in 2014. On August 15, 2011, Illwinter announced development of Conquest of Elysium III.

According to the , it has a population of people. The town of Guagua belongs to the Second District of Pampanga, along with the towns in the south-western part of the province. It is from the capital city of San Fernando and from Metro Manila. The town is bounded on the north by the towns of Bacolor and Santa Rita; on the south by the towns of Sasmuan and Lubao; on the east, Macabebe and Sasmuan; and on the west, Porac and Floridablanca. History Wawa (L√°n-n√¢ng: ÂÅéÂ≤∏, Hua-hua), which means \\"river mouth\\" (Kapampangan: alua or bukana), was the earliest recorded form of the town's name according to records dating back to 1590. The town is strategically located along a river which played a vital role in trade and transportation during the precolonial era. Wawa was already a prosperous settlement when Spanish colonists took control of the town in the year 1561, from then on calling it Guagua, which is a Hispanised form of the original name. Indeed, archeological artifacts have been excavated in a nearby town which affirmed the existence of a prehistoric community in Guagua. Early inhabitants opted to stay in the town because it was here that they could engage in barter trade with people from different islands, along with other means of livelihood like fishing and farming. The navigable river with which the town was endowed allowed shipping vessels to transport commodities to and from other chief localities, particularly the imperial Manila. The first cargo boat to arrive in Guagua was the Do√±a Dominga on 7 May 1884. Much later it was followed by the steamships Kaibigan and Kababayan, which anchored at the pier in Bgy Santo Ni√±o, better known as the Ya√±gco Landing. In 1892, when the Manila‚ÄìMabalacat railroad was inaugurated, Guagua was virtually the port of embarkation to and from Manila that served the province. Commerce was further improved when the San Fernando‚ÄìGuagua line of the railroad was chartered on 17 November 1907. The Chinese have long been part in Guagua's social and economic mainstream. In the 18th century, they sought refuge in the town to escape discrimination and persecution in Manila. After their near-total slaughter, the Chinese lived in relative peace while they freely practiced their craft and mingled hand-in-hand with the local residents. The Chinese residents were merchants, masons, woodcarvers, carpenters, agriculturists and labourers. Their influence on the cultural and economic life of Guagua cannot be overlooked. The town could not have prospered so well without the economic services provided by the Chinese. The town took significant part in the revolutionary struggles against the foreign intruders. A house near a church was made a secret cell of the Katipuneros in August 1897. In March 1898, a massacre of all Spanish sympathisers in Guagua marked the end of Spanish colonialism and the outset of American rule. Moreover, during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and the ensuing Second World War, Guagua became an important battleground. At the turn of the twentieth century, a new system of education was introduced and made popular and available to the Filipinos. The Guagua Elementary School in Bgy Santa Filomena, is believed to be the first to be established in the town in the year 1901. Later in that year, an English teacher came to Betis district and opened a primary school which functioned on a regular basis. In 1908, Colegio del Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s (now St Mary's Academy in Bgy San Roque) was established in a two-storey building donated by a charitable matron, in downtown Guagua. Later in 1918, Guagua National Institute (now Guagua National Colleges in Bgy Santa Filomena) was founded at the convent of the Catholic church. Further, in 1941, the then-parish priest felt the need for another high school in town, so he opened Saint Michael's College. At the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986, the local government carried out a sustainable development program to address the town's destitute state. From its income classification in 1986 as a third-class municipality, Guagua grew to a first-class one. Guagua garnered several outstanding citations for its achievement, including of several \\"Most Outstanding LGU\\" awards. Guagua was severely devastated by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. Geography =Topography= The town is mostly flat and is suitable to any kind of development; agricultural, industrial, commercial and others. It is only a meter above sea level. =Soil type= In general, the soils of Guagua are of recent alluvial origin consisting of fine sand, silt loam and hydrosol. The average chemical analysis of its top soils is : nitrogen, 0.02 to 0.1; phosphorus, 0.06 to 0.28; potassium, 0.46 to 1.74; organic carbon, 0.41 to 3.02; and pH value (acidity and alkalinity), 5.61 to 6.99 =Flora and fauna= The climate and topographical features of the vast land of Guagua make it ideal for the growing of fruit trees and vegetables. Among the fruit trees most fitting to be planted are mangoes, guavas, santol, star apples, and bananas. For vegetables, sitao, upo, ampalaya, gabi and cucumber are the most commonly produced by farmers and which thrive best in the community. Being void of forest areas, its fauna are mostly the domesticated ones like, chicken, ducks, cattle, and others. =Climate= =Barangays= Guagua is divided into four (4) districts, subdivided into 31 barangays: San Rafael was constituted from Dock Island in 1956. Demographics In the , the population of Guagua, Pampanga, was people, with a density of . =Religion= Roman Catholic 88%, Iglesia ni Cristo 5%, Members Church of God Internationa 3%, Seventh-day Adventists 2%, Others (Including Buddhism,Islam and Other Religionist) 2%. Local government 1937 Town hall Like other towns in the Philippines, Guagua is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the Barangays of Barrios. =1937 Heritage Town hall= The seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation. Education Immaculate Concepcion Academy St. Mary's Academy For elementary and high school education, Guagua has numerous schools. =Public= =Private= *Natividad Adventist Elementary School *St. Mary's Academy of Guagua *Psalms Academy of Pampanga *EZEE Center for the Arts and School Inc. *Mary the Queen College (Pampanga), Inc. *Guagua National Colleges *Immaculate Conception Academy Landmarks and List of Cultural Properties The town has interesting culture and heritage attractions and landmarks, including Rufino Santos Catholic Center, Capt. Ruben P. Sonco Freedom Square, Monument of Aurelio Tolentino (1867-1915). The Guagua National Colleges is also declared as a national historical landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines during the college's 75th Foundation anniversary in 1993. } =Santiago Apostol Parish Church= The 1607 Santiago Apostol Parish Church, commonly known as Betis Church is a Baroque (heritage) Church, located in Guagua, Pampanga (Betis Area). It is a Spanish-era church declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines and the NCCA (under R.A. 4896 as amended by P.D. 374 and R.A. 8492), on November 5, 2001 (one of only 26 churches in the country bestowed that honor). It is part of the Ecclesiastical Provinces of the Archdiocese of San Fernando. In 2009, the National Museum installed a marker of its 2005 Proclamation. =Immaculate Conception Parish Church= The first church edifice was constructed in 1587 but was unfortunately razed by fire. The current Church structure was constructed in 1772 under the administration of the Augustinians. The Church was greatly improved in 1862 until 1870. The interiors are simple and the centerpiece attraction is the main altar, a creation of noted local artist Willy Layug. While still simple, the exteriors on the other hand, are marked by massive strength. The Cathedral-type church is located immediately adjacent to the Guagua Municipal Building and houses the Cardinal Santos Catholic Center and the Immaculate Conception Parochial School.

There are a number of advantages of doing data analysis using Emacs/ESS in this way, rather than interacting with R, S-PLUS or other software directly. First, as indicated above, ESS provides a convenient way of writing and executing code without frequently switching between programs. This also encourages the good practice of keeping a record of one's data analysis, equivalent to working from do-files in Stata. Third, since emacs is also an able editor of LaTeX files, it facilitates the integration of data analysis and written text with Sweave.

Georg Rudolf Weckherlin (15 September 1584 ‚Äì 13 February 1653) was a German poet and diplomat. Influenced by the French La Pl√©iade, his poetry introduced Renaissance forms and themes previously unknown in German verse. In his political career, Weckherlin worked in the service of the Electorate of the Palatinate, serving on diplomatic missions to France and England. Weckherlin would eventually come to be employed by the English crown as an expert on foreign languages and cryptography, and continued to serve in this position in the Commonwealth of England. Biography Georg Weckherlin was born at Stuttgart. After studying law in T√ºbingen he settled at Stuttgart, and, as secretary to Duke Johann Friedrich of W√ºrttemberg, was employed on diplomatic missions to France and England. Between 1620 and 1624 he lived in England in the service of the Electorate of the Palatinate, and from this connection came to be employed in various positions in the English government. He was chief clerk to a succession of Secretaries of State and was especially skilled in foreign languages and cryptology. He acted as a licenser of London foreign news publications for Charles I and in the mid-1630s he assisted with the negotiations for the development of an offensive and defensive treaty with France that would have brought Britain directly into the Thirty Years' War.Jayne E. E. Boys, London's News Press and the Thirty Years War, Suffolk and Rochester, 2011, Although employed by the English crown, when civil war came in 1642, Weckherlin chose to remain in London and serve the bureaucracy that supported the Long Parliament. In 1644 he was appointed \\"Secretary for Foreign Tongues\\" in England, a position in which, on the establishment of the Commonwealth, he was followed by Milton. His son had a position in the household of Charles I's oldest son Prince Charles and went into exile with the royalists. He did not return to England until 1660 after the death of his father in 1653 in London. Weckherlin was the most distinguished of the circle of South German poets who prepared the way for the Renaissance movement associated in Germany with Martin Opitz. His models were the poets of the French Pleiade, and with his psalms, odes and sonnets he broke new ground for the German lyric. An epic poem on the death of Gustavus Adolphus, in alexandrines, seems to have won most favor with his contemporaries. Works Two volumes of his Oden und Ges√§nge appeared in 1618 and 1619; his collected Geistliche und weltliche Gedichte in 1641. Weckherlin's Gedichte (Poems) have been edited by Hermann Fischer for the Stuttgarter Literarischer Verein (vols. cxcix.-cc., 1894‚Äì1895). Selections were published by W. M√ºller (1823) and Karl Goedeke (1873). His chief English poems were ‚ÄúTriumphal Shows Set Forth Lately at Stuttgart‚Äù (1616) and ‚ÄúPanegyricke to Lord Hay, Viscount of Doncaster‚Äù (1619).

He is currently a youth coordinator at Borussia Dortmund, a position he has had since the summer 2008. He represented Borussia Dortmund during his entire professional career, which spanned 15 years, being the youngest player to ever appear for the club in an official match, a record later broken by Nuri ≈ûahin. A German international for five years, Ricken represented the country at the 2002 World Cup and the 1999 Confederations Cup. Football career Born in Dortmund, Ricken joined local BV Borussia at an early age, and made his Bundesliga debut on 8 March 1994 in a 1‚Äì2 home defeat against VfB Stuttgart, aged not yet 18. From the following season onwards, he became a regular. Ricken scored a memorable long-distance goal in the final of the 1996‚Äì97 edition of the UEFA Champions League against Juventus F.C., which stood as the fastest in a final of the competition by a substitute, finding the net after just 16 seconds on the field. He also contributed with 8 goals in 47 matches in the team's back-to-back national titles (1994‚Äì96). In the following years, Ricken's success was hampered by a series of injuries. He gained his first cap for Germany on 10 September 1997, in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Armenia, but missed that major international tournament as well as UEFA Euro 2000. Later, he restored his form, helping Dortmund to claim the league title in 2002 by scoring a career-best six goals and being selected by national coach Rudi V√∂ller for the squad at that year's World Cup; he did not play in the competition, however, as Germany emerged runners-up. Ricken's injury woes returned after the World Cup and, as a consequence, he failed to earn recognition at both European or international level. In early April 2007, he was demoted to the reserve team by manager Thomas Doll, due to substandard performance. In November 2007, Ricken announced his retirement from football. In an attempt to return to football, he briefly attended a training camp in February 2008 with the Columbus Crew of the Major League Soccer, but returned to Germany and Dortmund after a few days. On 11 June 2008, Borussia Dortmund sport director Michael Zorc, also a former club footballer, announced that Ricken was to be hired as youth coordinator with immediate effect, while still appearing for the amateur side in Regionalliga West. However, on 16 February 2009, he announced his retirement from professional football.

According to the , it has a population of people.  History  Macabebe, an ancient town in the modern-day province of Pampanga, is intimately linked to the Pampanga River (R√≠o Grande de la Pampanga). The town was named Macabebe because it is geographically situated along the shores (Pampangan: bebe; Tagalog: baybay) or banks of R√≠o Grande de Pampanga. The town is sometimes referred to as Makabibe because of the abundance of corals and shells along the R√≠o Grande in earlier times. The Macabebes were the first Kapampangans to appear in European recorded history. In the Spanish Colonial period of the Philippines, Macabebe was considered one of the oldest and most important communities of Pampanga. The ancient town of Macabebe owes its importance to its location along the Rio Grande de la Pampanga (Pampanga River). The river's routes and its northern tributaries provided the pathways to the early major settlements in Pampanga. The English translation of Macabebe, meaning: 'surrounded by rivers' describes the historical heritage of the ancient town.otopphilippines.gov.ph The Macabebe dialect is said to be harsher and louder than others due to how the townspeople communicate across the river. The Pampanga River is of great importance to Macabebe. Fishing is still a major source of sustenance and income for its residents. A number of fisheries can be found along the river. The province of Pampanga is also the traditional homeland of the Kapampangan people. The Kapampangan of Macabebe had played a dynamic and at times conflicting role in the history of the Philippines. They fought against the Spanish in 1571, such as the case when the youthful Tarik Soliman (Bambalito)https://www.filipiknow.net/bambalito-the-first-warrior-hero-who- died-fighting-for-our-freedom/ became the first Kapampangan and Filipino martyr who fought against Spanish rule.https://www.filipiknow.net/bambalito- the-first-warrior-hero-who-died-fighting-for-our-freedom/ They also defended the last Spanish garrison against revolutionaries in 1898. The services of the Macabebes led to the naming of a street in Spain's capital city of Madrid in their honor, \\"Calle de Voluntarios Macabebes.\\" The Capampangans of Macabebe as well, is the great ally of imperial Spain when the Dutch invaders tried to colonize the Philippines. They fought together with the Spaniards to protect the islands from its invaders, and in return only the Capampangan is allowed to study in prominent exclusive schools and universities ran by the Spaniards. In 1901, American General Frederick Funston and his troops captured Philippine President Emilio Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela, with the help of some Kapampangans (later called the Macabebe Scouts after their home locale) who had joined the Americans' side. The Americans pretended to be captives of the Macabebes, who were dressed in Philippine Army uniforms. Once Funston and his \\"captors\\" entered Aguinaldo's camp, they immediately apprehended Aguinaldo and his men. During World War II, Japanese fighter and bomber planes air raided the municipalities of Macabebe in December 1941. Macabebe was subsequently occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army in 1942. Geography Macabebe is located in the southern part of Pampanga. It is bordered to the north by the municipalities of Minalin, Guagua and Apalit; to the east by the municipalities of Calumpit and Hagonoy in Bulacan; to the west by the municipality of Sasmuan; and to the south by the municipality of Masantol and Manila Bay. =Barangays= Macabebe is politically subdivided into 26 barangays. =Climate= Demographics Public Market In the , the population of Macabebe, Pampanga, was people, with a density of . =Religion= San Nicolas de Tolentino Parish Church San Gabriel Chapel Roman Catholicism is the town inhabitants' main religion. The town's population is composed of the following: Catholics 87%, Members Church of God International 5%, Iglesia ni Cristo 3%, Evangelicals 2%, others 3%. Churches The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando has jurisdiction over the San Nicolas de Tolentino Parish Church. It was founded in 1575 under the advocation of San Nicolas de Tolentino. The heritage church measures long, wide and high. The facade of the church has scant ornamentation and its architectural symmetry is lost amid the various forms assumed windows, and the main entrance. Simple neo-classic lines of the facade.http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=Churches&func;=all&pid;=4370&tbl;=0 Macabebe is also home to San Gabriel Chapel. This newly erected chapel is a replacement of the old chapel that has been devastated by the flooding after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. It was then formally constructed in 2002 and came into completion and inaugurated in May 2010. Another important church in the town is the Presentation of the Lord Parish in barangay Batasan. The chapel has been built over a century ago and was elevated to a parish church in 1995. Its first ‚Äúcura parroco‚Äù was Father Gabriel Torres. One of the most visited churches in Macabebe is the Sta Maria Chapel, the home of the barangay's Queen and Patroness (NUESTRA SENIORA DELA PAZ). The chapel is under the jurisdiction of San Rafael Archangel Parish Church. The newly erected chapel is a replacement of the old chapel because the old one has always been flooded during the rainy season. After the completion of its renovation, it was inaugurated in April 2005, and blessed by his Excellency Archbishop Paciano Aniceto, DD. The place where the church is erected was called \\"baliti\\". The name was attributed to the fact that prior to the arrival of the Spaniards in Macabebe, at that exact place, it was believed that a big balete tree was planted. Local government Like other towns in the Philippines, Macabebe is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected for three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the barangays of barrios. The District Office of the Congressional representative stands near the town centre. Tourism and culture The town is rich in its past and treasures. Its town hall and churches reveal the wealth of the town's heritage. =Town Fiesta= The town's fiesta is held annually on the 10th of September in honor of San Nicolas de Tolentino, the town's patron saint. =Barangay Fiestas= *Barangay Santa Maria.

Mankin (1996) Teams and Technology: Fulfilling the Promise of the New Organization. p. 13. and Professor of Information Systems and PWC Chair in Risk Management in the London School of Economics. Prior to the LSE, he was professor at the Theseus International Management Institute.  Work  Ciborra was an original thinker in his field: the Social Study of Information Systems. His contribution ranks among that of the top names in this and related fields such as Shoshana Zuboff, Wanda Orlikowski, Steve Barley, Lynn Markus, Lucas Introna, Jannis Kallinikos, Geoff Walsham, Rob Kling, Daniel Robey, Chrisanthi Avgerou and Richard Boland. He collaborated widely, including with such scholars as Ole Hanseth (University of Oslo) and Giovan Francesco Lanzara (University of Bologna). Ciborra contributed to the following areas. *The relationship between technology and organizations *Transaction cost theory and IS *Organizational learning, bricolage and improvisation *IS infrastructures. =Improvisation= Ciborra goes beyond the typical characterisation of improvisation as situated, pragmatic and contingent action by referring to the existential condition of the actor (his ‚Äúmoods feelings, affectations and fundamental attunement with the situation‚Äù). By eschewing the notion of the actor as a ‚Äúrobot‚Äù adapting to changing circumstances he reintroduces the personal human aspects that shape our encounters with the world and shows how our affectations define the situation at hand and so shape action. =Bricolage= As expounded by Ciborra, bricolage can be seen as the constant re-ordering of people and resources, the constant \\"trying out\\" and experimentation that is the true hallmark of organisational change. But bricolage is not a random trying out: Ciborra emphasises that it is a trying out based on leveraging the world \\"as defined by the situation\\". =Hospitality (xenia)= Hospitality is Claudio's attempt to present an alternative conception of how IT/IS is implemented. He rejects the scientific explanations of IS implementation (planning, design, goals, targets, methods, procedures) and instead views technology as an alien embodying and exemplifying its alien culture and affordances. Successful implementation is achieved when the \\"host\\" organisation (i.e. that implementing the technology) is able to extend courtesy and to absorb and appropriate/assimilate the alien culture where it offers advantages such as new ways of working. Claudio also warns that the host must beware that the guest can quickly become hostile. =Crisis= Ciborra claims that much of the IS and IT world (particularly their strategic management, marketing, academia and training organisations) are in crisis. He teaches that this is because IS and IT are treated as scientific disciplines when in fact they are social disciplines and hence thinking about them is based in an inappropriate paradigm which we might call \\"Positivism\\" (although Ciborra does not use this term). =Formative context= Ciborra drew on the work of Roberto Unger and showed how IS can embody and so be enacted as Formative Context. *Drift *Caring *The Platform Organisation =Gestell= Ciborra analyses Information System infrastructure using Heidegger's concept of Gestell.

History The Ultraverse line was launched by Malibu Comics during the \\"comics boom\\" of the early 1990s. The new imprint debuted in June of 1993 with the characters Prime (comics), Hardcase and The Strangers. The Ultraverse was created a group of writers like Mike W Ward, Steve Englehart,Steve Gerber, James D. Hudnall, Gerard Jones, James Robinson, Len Strazewski and Larry Niven. The new imprint emphasized tight continuity between the various series in their line; Malibu made extensive use of crossovers, in which a story that began in one series would be continued in the next-shipping issue of another series. Various promotions for special editions or limited-print stories also encouraged readers to sample issues of the entire line. The Ultraverse line came to dominate Malibu's catalog. Several characters from the series Ultraforce were featured in a short-lived animated series by the same name in 1994-1995. As American comics sales declined in the mid-1990s, Malibu canceled lower-selling series.

The initial move was foreseen with popular franchises and characters from the Avengers guest-starring in their books. The \\"volume 2\\" series each started with \\"#‚àû\\" (infinity) issues and the Ultraverse characters were exposed to drastic new status quos. The Black September event consisted in a crossover between the Ultraverse an Marvel Universe, when the hero teams Ultraforce and the Avengers (comics) meet and fought Loki (comics) and the entity Nemesis for the possession of the Infinity Gems. The result was a reality change event where the history and continuity of the Ultraverse was retconned, in numerous ways, and a number of characters (like Hardcase, Prototype's Jimmy Ruiz and Contrary) simply ceased to exist (or in the new continuity, to have ever existed).

The now-modified Ultraverse lasted less than a year and a half before the changes proved unpopular and various series were cancelled again a short time later in 1996. The last books: Prime,Rune: Hearts of Darkness and Ultraforce lasted until December of 1996, when they also were cancelled.

In June 2005, when asked by Newsarama whether Marvel had any plans to revive the Ultraverse , Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada replied that: Senior Vice President of Publishing Tom Brevoort has stated in the past that the reason Marvel cannot discuss the Ultraverse properties is because of non disclosure agreements in place with certain parties, which has been speculated to pertain to Scott Mitchell Rosenberg's contractual position as \\"ongoing producer deal for all Malibu Comics properties\\".De Blieck, Augie Jr. (December 17, 2013). \\"Miracleman, Malibu's Coloring Department & More!\\" CBR.com.

Early life and career Stephenson was born in London on 13 February 1878. His father was a merchant in the Indian trade. Stephenson joined the Royal Navy aged fourteen in 1892 when he began his training at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. As a midshipman he was posted to and . While with Forte he was involved in the Punitive Expedition of 1897 in Benin. Following promotion to sub-lieutenant on 15 June 1898, he went first to the First Destroyer Flotilla. In February 1900 he was posted to , flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet, and served on for the voyage to Malta. The following year he was given his first command, the torpedo boat, TB 90. He was promoted lieutenant in June 1900. Stephenson managed to make a favourable impression on Admiral Sir Jackie Fisher, the then Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean. As a result, Stephenson, aged just 23, was given command of the destroyer, . He then took the torpedo course at Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and was posted to the staff of , the Royal Navy's torpedo school. This was followed by appointments as torpedo officer aboard the cruisers and . After promotion to lieutenant commander, he served as First Lieutenant on the battleship . He was promoted commander in 1912. First World War and first retirement At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Stephenson was based in the Admiralty, attached to the Naval Intelligence Division. However, he soon managed to obtain a seagoing role as executive officer of . He was involved in operations in the Dardanelles, and then commanded a fleet of naval trawlers undertaking patrols from Crete. He went on to command the gunboat and, (as an acting captain) the Otranto Barrage, a fleet of small boats which attempted to control the exit from the Adriatic Sea, particularly trying to prevent submarines of the Austro-Hungarian Navy breaking out into the Mediterranean. In this last role, he also undertook early experiments into the use of hydrophones to detect submarines. He was Mentioned in Despatches in December 1918, appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1919 New Year Honours, awarded the Greek decoration of Commander of the Order of the Redeemer for his service in the Mediterranean and Adriatic, and was also awarded the United States Navy Distinguished Service Medal. These experiments led to Stephenson's first post-war role, as director of the anti- submarine division of the Admiralty. He found many of his fellow officers conservative in their approach, and struggled to get new techniques accepted. He left this role in 1921 to command the cruiser , and then in 1923 the battleship , where he had the young Louis Mountbatten as one of his junior officers. Stephenson then served ashore, first as Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth and then as Commodore of Portsmouth Naval Barracks, where he undertook many innovations to raise morale including regular community singing. In 1929, he was part of the official British delegation at the funeral of Marshal Ferdinand Foch, acting as Naval Aide-de- camp to Prince George, and later that year was placed on the retired list, with promotion to rear admiral. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1930. From 1932 to 1935 he was Secretary of the Navy League, and he was promoted to vice admiral in 1934. He also ran a boys' club near his Hampshire home, where he was nicknamed \\"Monkey Brand\\" as the boys thought his heavily whiskered face was like the image used to advertise a well-known household cleaning product. Second World War With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Stephenson was recalled as Commodore, Royal Navy Reserve. Initially he served as a Commodore of Convoy and made several trips in that capacity. He was also involved in the Dunkirk evacuation. In 1940 Stephenson was tasked with setting up the training base at Tobermory on the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. This was to be the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Training School for the remainder of the war and Stephenson's greatest legacy was that his training methods had an influence within the service that lasted long after the cessation of conflict. Stephenson realised that the task of training war-time reservist officers and hostilities-only ratings required a different approach to that of training regulars. He believed that the most important priority was making the trainees determined to win; then that they understood the importance of discipline; next the importance of correct administration; and finally technical proficiency‚Äîhe felt that skill would be worthless if overall spirit were lacking. He emphasised strict discipline in his training combined with encouraging a willingness to adapt quickly to various situations with surprise inspections and orders to trainees as well as creative wargames to simulate difficult situations at sea. A frequently recounted anecdote is that when inspecting a corvette and its crew, Stephenson suddenly threw his hat on the deck and called it an unexploded bomb. A trainee (variously reported as quartermaster, or a sub-lieutenant) immediately kicked it into the water. After Stephenson commended him for quick action, but wanting his heavily gold- braided hat back, he then suddenly said the hat was now a man overboard and the trainee had to dive in to retrieve it. Stephenson had the reputation of being a very hard taskmaster, with officers being replaced before the ship was allowed to leave (and even commanding officers being dismissed on occasion). However, he was reportedly very pleasant to those who matched his standards. Although he was disliked by the trainees, who called him \\"The Terror of Tobermory\\" and \\"The Monkey\\", Stephenson was credited in producing capable sailors who were able to meet the demands of the Battle of the Atlantic. As such, Stephenson is credited with being a factor in turning the tide in favour of the Allies in that critical contest in the war. A noted fictionalised depiction of Stephenson and his Second World War assignment is presented in Nicholas Monsarrat's novel The Cruel Sea. Stephenson was reportedly very proud of this depiction. Over the four-and-a-half years Stephenson ran the school, 911 ships went through 1132 training courses at HMS Western Isles. He was again Mentioned in Despatches in 1940, knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1943 Birthday Honours, and was later given the decoration of Commander with Star of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. He retired for the second time in 1945, with the anti-submarine battle won. Second retirement This second retirement saw Stephenson just as active as he had been previously. He was appointed Honorary Commodore of the Sea Cadet Corps in 1949, a post he held until the age of eighty in 1958, when he finally felt it necessary to step down. Stephenson settled in Saffron Walden, and took a strong interest in local affairs, being known locally as \\"The Admiral\\". He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Essex in 1949, but resigned with 7 others in 1968. His name was listed as a sponsor of the National Fellowship in a full-page advertisement placed in The Times by the Fellowship in 1962. Stephenson died in Saffron Walden on 27 May 1972, at the age of 94.

Bush from 2004‚Äì2007, and is currently a political pundit on TV. She previously served as Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism. In 2008, Townsend joined CNN as a contributor, but later switched over to CBS where she is now a national security analyst for them. Townsend is president of the Counter Extremism Project. Early life and education Frances Mary Fragos was born on December 28, 1961 in Mineola, New York, the daughter of John Fragos, a Greek American roofer, and Dorothy, an Irish American office manager for a construction company. Raised in Wantagh, Long Island, Townsend was the first in her family to finish high school. At the age of 11, she penned letters requesting that she be allowed to be an altar boy, first to her priest, then to the bishop, the Cardinal, and ultimately to the Vatican. After her requests were refused, her priest caught her trying to sneak into Mass with a borrowed robe. Her parents were determined that their only child should receive a college education, but could not afford to send her to school. Townsend saved money by accelerating her course load, waiting tables and working as a dormitory adviser. Townsend graduated cum laude from the American University in 1982, receiving a B.A. in Political Science and a B.S. in Psychology. She received her J.D. from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1984, and in 1986, attended the British Institute of International and Comparative Law in London, England. Career Townsend began her prosecutorial career in 1985, serving as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, New York. She gained the support and mentorship of federal prosecutors Rudolph Giuliani and Louis Freeh. In 1988, she was hired by Giuliani for the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York where she worked on white-collar crime. Townsend also ran the office's organized crime unit, where she conducted one-on-one interviews with members of the Gambino crime family. Townsend moved to the Justice Department in the early 1990s to work on international legal matters. In 1991, she worked in the Office of the Attorney General to assist in establishing the newly created Office of International Programs, the predecessor to the Executive Office for National Security. In December 1993, she joined the Criminal Division where she served as Chief of Staff to the Assistant Attorney General, where she took part in establishing the Division's international training and rule of law programs. During the Clinton administration, Townsend served in a series of positions at the Justice Department, eventually working as intelligence policy counsel for Attorney General Janet Reno. She served as Director of the Office of International Affairs in the Criminal Division from November 1995 until November 1997, when she was appointed Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General. Townsend was appointed Counsel for Intelligence Policy in March 1998, heading the office of Intelligence Policy and Review, whose various functions included approving intelligence-gathering activities related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Townsend managed the Justice Department's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review until 2001. She was one of Reno's key advisers, acting as a \\"back channel\\" between the attorney general and FBI Special Agent John P. O'Neill, who was also her friend. The incoming Bush administration did not opt to keep Townsend on. Instead, she served as Assistant Commandant for Intelligence for the United States Coast Guard. While she was on maternity leave during the September 11 attacks in 2001, Townsend assisted the Coast Guard in updating intelligence legislation to switch the branch's priority from drug smuggling to the vulnerability of U.S. ports. Despite concerns about Townsend's past as a Democratic appointee, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice hired her for the National Security Council in Spring 2003 at the urging of counterterrorism chief John A. Gordon and Homeland Security Advisor Richard A. Clarke. In December 2003, she coordinated government terrorism responses that led to the grounding of flights from Europe during the holiday season. She was appointed Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism on May 28, 2004. During her tenure, she oversaw an intelligence reorganization and conducted the first post-9/11 review of the White House's anti-terrorism campaign. Townsend served as the public face of the Bush administration while it was under criticism for allegedly overreacting to dated intelligence in its decision to raise terrorist threat levels during an election season. She also inspected Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison as an envoy of President Bush. Townsend was tapped to implement broad changes in the intelligence community recommended by a presidential commission headed by former Senator Chuck Robb and U.S. District Judge Laurence Silberman. Townsend then served in the United States Department of Justice, including a stint as Counsel to the Attorney General for Intelligence Policy in the George W. Bush administration. In May 2007, she was appointed \\"National Continuity Coordinator\\" under the auspices of National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 51. Townsend currently serves as an Advisory Board member for Protiviti Inc. a global consulting firm. She also sits on the Atlantic Council's Board of Directors. Other memberships include the Partnership for a Secure America, Council on Foreign Relations, and the Leadership Council for Concordia. In November 2016, the UAE Ambassador to the United States al-Otaiba recommended through Tom Barrack that Townsend become President Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence or Secretary of Homeland Security. In May 2017, Townsend was on the short list for the Director of the FBI following James Comey's firing. Personal life Frances Fragos married lawyer John Michael Townsend on October 8, 1994 in an Episcopal ceremony at Manhattan's Church of the Incarnation. As of 2006, they have two children, both sons. With a self- professed \\"triple type-A\\" personality, Townsend has been described as having a characteristic bluntness and a \\"sometimes salty, streetwise style\\" that once led her coworkers to nickname her \\"The Hurricane\\".

Life and work Waltershausen was born at G√∂ttingen and educated at this city's university. There he devoted his attention to physical and natural science, and in particular to mineralogy. Waltershausen was named after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who was close friends with his parents.See link to see title page of book of their correspondence. Waltershausen's father, Georg, was a writer, lecturer and professor of economics and history at G√∂ttingen. Georg Sartorius (later Sartorius von Waltershausen) is best known in his role of translator and popularizer of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. His son, August, was a well known economist who specialized in American economy, and had at least one of his books translated into English. Front page of Der Aetna During a tour in 1834-1835 Waltershausen carried out a series of magnetic observations in various parts of Europe. He then gave his attention to an exhaustive investigation of the volcano of Mount Etna, in Sicily, and carried on the work with some interruptions until 1843 including with Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters. The chief result of this undertaking was his great Atlas des √Ñtna (1858‚Äì1861), in which he distinguished the lava streams formed during the later centuries. After his return from Mount Etna, Waltershausen visited Iceland, and subsequently published Physisch- geographische Skizze von Island (1847), √úber die vulkanischen Gesteine in Sizilien und Island (1853), and Geologischer Atlas von Island (1853). Meanwhile, he was appointed professor of mineralogy and geology at G√∂ttingen, and held this post for about thirty years, until his death. In 1866 Waltershausen published an important essay entitled Recherches sur les climats de l'√©poque actuelle et des √©poques anciennes; in this he expressed his belief that the Ice age was due to changes in the configuration of the Earth's surface. He died at G√∂ttingen. In 1880, Arnold von Lasaulx edited Waltershausen notes and published the book Der Aetna (cover page pictured). Gauss zum Ged√§chtnis Waltershausen was also the author of Gauss zum Ged√§chtnis, in 1856. This biography, published upon the death of Carl Friedrich Gauss, is viewed as Gauss's biography as Gauss wished it to be told. It is also the source of one of the most famous mathematical quotes: Mathematics is the queen of the sciences.Variants include: \\"Mathematics is the queen of sciences and arithmetic the queen of mathematics. She often condescends to render service to astronomy and other natural sciences, but in all relations she is entitled to the first rank\\" and \\"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics (Die Mathematik ist die K√∂nigin der Wissenschaften und die Zahlentheorie ist die K√∂nigin der Mathematik.). and the famous story of Gauss as a young boy quickly finding the sum of a long string of consecutive numbersSee for discussion of original sourcing by Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen. When Gauss died in G√∂ttingen, two individuals gave eulogies at his funeral: Gauss's son-in-law Heinrich Ewald, and Waltershausen who represented the faculty in G√∂ttingen.

The Parable of the Ten Virgins (section) by Phoebe Traquair, Mansfield Traquair Church, Edinburgh. The Parable of the Ten Virgins, also known as the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins or the Parable of the ten bridesmaids,Jerusalem Bible: Matthew 25:1-13 is one of the parables of Jesus. According to , ten virgins await a bridegroom; five have brought enough oil for their lamps for the wait, while another five need to purchase more oil after the arrival is delayed. The five virgins who are prepared for the bridegroom's arrival are rewarded, while the five who are not prepared are disowned. The parable has a clear eschatological theme: be prepared for the Day of Judgement.John Barton, The Oxford Bible Commentary, Oxford University Press, 2001, , p. 878. It was one of the most popular parables in the Middle Ages and had influence on Gothic art, sculpture and the architecture of German and French cathedrals. Narrative according to the Gospel of Matthew In the Parable of the Ten Virgins, Jesus tells a story about a party of virgins, perhaps bridesmaids or torchbearers for a procession, chosen to participate in a wedding. Each of the ten virgins is carrying a lamp or torch as they await the coming of the bridegroom, which they expect at some time during the night. Five of the virgins are wise and have brought oil for their lamps. Five are foolish and have only brought their lamps. At midnight, all the virgins hear the call to come out to meet the bridegroom. Realising their lamps have gone out, the foolish virgins ask the wise ones for oil, but they refuse, saying that there will certainly not (Greek ou mƒì)John Nolland, The Gospel of Matthew: A commentary on the Greek text, Eerdmans, 2005, , pp. 1006‚Äì1008. be enough for them to share. While the foolish virgins are away trying to get more oil, the bridegroom arrives. The wise virgins then accompany him to the celebration. The others arrive too late and are excluded. Interpretations The parable is one of a sequence of responses to a question in Matthew 24:3: Other parables in this sequence include the parable of the budding fig tree (Matthew 24:32‚Äì35) and the parable of the Faithful Servant (Matthew 24:42‚Äì51). The parable of the Ten Virgins reinforces the call for readiness in the face of the uncertain time of this second \\"coming.\\"R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary, Eerdmans, 1985, , pp. 349-352. It has been described as a \\"watching parable.\\"Catholic Encyclopedia: PARABLES. Like the parable of the Lost Coin, it is a parable about women which immediately follows, and makes the same point as, a preceding parable about men.The parable of the Lost Coin follows the parable of the Lost Sheep and this parable follows the parable of the Faithful Servant. This painting by Hieronymus Francken the Younger (c. 1616) gives a moralistic interpretation of the parable. In this parable, Jesus Christ is the bridegroom, echoing the Old Testament image of God as the bridegroom in Jeremiah 2:2 and similar passages, and the virgins are the Christians. The awaited event is the Second Coming of Christ. R. T. France writes that the parable is \\"a warning addressed specifically to those inside the professing church who are not to assume that their future is unconditionally assured.\\" The parable does not criticise the virgins for sleeping, since both groups do that,Ben Witherington, Women in the Ministry of Jesus: A study of Jesus' attitudes to women and their roles as reflected in his earthly life, Cambridge University Press, 1987, , p. 43. but for being unprepared as they brought no oil (it is unclear as to whether the foolish virgins succeed in purchasing any oil that night:John R. Donahue, Hearing the Word of God: Reflections on the Sunday Readings: Year A, Liturgical Press, 2004, , p. 134: \\"We never know whether they found it, but when they return, the feast has started and the door is barred.\\" most shops would not have been openCraig S. Keener, The Gospel of Matthew: A Socio- Rhetorical Commentary, Eerdmans, 2009, , p. 597.J. Dwight Pentecost, The Parables of Jesus: Lessons in life from the Master Teacher, Kregel Publications, 1998, , p. 150.). The New Testament scholar, Dan O. Via, considers the story of the bridesmaids as an example of a tragic parable with an inverted U-shaped plot.Dan O. Via, The Parables: Their Literary and Existential Dimension (Philadelphia: Fortress Press,1967; reprinted Wipf and Stock, 2007), 122-128. The rising action of the parable is the preparation for the coming of the bridegroom, but a crisis occurs when the bridegroom is delayed. This is the turning point (reversal or peripety) that leads to disaster. A recognition scene (anagnorisis) of the five foolish maidens occurs too late to reverse their fortunes (cf. Matthew 25:12). Yet the reader can benefit from their folly by considering the fatal flaw or hamartia that causes their downfall and by asking how their error in judgment can be avoided.James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 206-08. The parable is not written in praise of virginity, and indeed Louis of Granada, in his The Sinner's Guide of 1555, writes \\"No one makes intercession with the Bridegroom for the five foolish virgins who, after despising the pleasures of the flesh and stifling in their hearts the fire of concupiscence, nay, after observing the great counsel of virginity, neglected the precept of humility and became inflated with pride on account of their virginity.\\"Louis of Granada, The Sinner's Guide, 1555. Spencer W. Kimball gave an LDS perspective on the difference between the wise and the foolish virgins, and why they could not share the oil: \\"This was not selfishness or unkindness. The kind of oil that is needed to illuminate the way and light up the darkness is not shareable. How can one share obedience to the principle of tithing; a mind at peace from righteous living; an accumulation of knowledge? How can one share faith or testimony? How can one share attitudes or chastity.... Each must obtain that kind of oil for himself.\\"Spencer W. Kimball, Faith Precedes the Miracle, p. 255. Authenticity The parable occurs in all ancient New Testament manuscripts, with only slight variations in some words.United Bible Societies, The Greek New Testament, 1983, p. 24. Bible commentators and scholars do not entirely agree on the nature of the parable: whether it is an authentic parable of Jesus, based on an authentic parable but significantly modified, or entirely an invention of the early Church. According to Jan Lambrecht, \\"a considerable number of exegetes in fact suppose that the parable of 'The Wise and Foolish Virgins' ultimately goes back to Jesus.\\"Jan Lambrecht, Out of the Treasure: The parables in the Gospel of Matthew, Peeters, 1991, , p. 204. Other scholars believe that this parable has only been lightly edited.Klyne Snodgrass, Stories with Intent: A comprehensive guide to the parables of Jesus, Eerdmans, 2008, , p. 505. The argument for modification is due to the parable's eschatological nature, which seems to speak more directly to the situation of the early Church rather than the situation during Jesus's life (Sitz im Leben). A large majority of fellows on the Jesus Seminar, for example, designated the parable as merely similar to something Jesus might have said or simply inauthentic (\\"grey\\" or \\"black\\").Funk, Robert W., Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. The Five Gospels. Harper:San Francisco, 1993, p. 254 Bart Ehrman wrote that the parable makes sense within the context of the Church during the time period before the Gospel of Matthew was written, around 60-90 AD. Many early Christians believed the Second Coming of Jesus and the establishment of the Kingdom of God was imminent, yet this did not occur. In the parable, the bridegroom has been \\"delayed\\". The parable is thus an encouragement to keep watch and stay prepared for Christians who expected Jesus to have already returned. Liturgical use In the Catholic Church, the parable is the Gospel reading for the 32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time in Cycle A; in the extraordinary form of the Roman rite (Tridentine Mass), the parable is the Gospel reading for Masses of virgins and virgin martyrs. The parable is the Gospel reading for the 27th Sunday after Trinity in the traditional Lutheran lectionary. In the Revised Common Lectionary, the parable is read in Proper 27 (32nd Sunday in Ordinary Time). In the Armenian Orthodox Church the parable is the main theme of Holy Monday. A special Church service enacting the parable of the ten virgins is celebrated on Tuesday evening of the Holy Week. In the Syriac Orthodox Church, the parable is used to commemorate the Sunday vespers service of Nahire. Nahire symbolizes our lives in accordance with the 10 virgins that only through a life of dedication, vigilance, fasting and prayer can we be ready for the Bridegroom himself. In the arts This parable has been a popular subject for painting, sculpture, music, and drama. Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, 1838‚Äì1842 (detail), St√§del Museum, Frankfurt am Main. =Painting= The parable has been depicted in several paintings, including altarpieces in Northern Europe. A recent example, from 1954, is by Tove Jansson. In the 19th century, the artists of the Nazarene movement also took up this theme. =Sculpture= Three wise virgins appear with Christ on Strasbourg Cathedral. Sculptures of the wise and foolish virgins were a common motif in medieval ecclesial architecture in Europe, especially for the decoration of doorways, and carved figures representing them appear on many of the medieval churches and cathedrals of the Gothic style, including: * Amiens Cathedral * Auxerre Cathedral * Laon Cathedral * Notre Dame de Paris * Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims * Strasbourg Cathedral * Erfurt Cathedral * Magdeburg Cathedral The virgins are also depicted on cathedrals in Switzerland and other countries; the portal leading into the main church of Hovhannavank (1216-1221) in Armenia has carved scenes from the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins. The ubiquity of such sculptures has inspired a fictional description: the carvings on the doors of Kingsbridge cathedral in Ken Follett's novel World Without End, set in the Late Middle Ages. =Music= Several religious musical compositions have been inspired by the parable. Its message was formed into a hymn, \\"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme\\", by Philipp Nicolai, which Johann Sebastian Bach used for his chorale cantata Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140. The parable forms the theme for several hymns, including the 19th century hymn \\"Behold the Bridegroom Cometh\\" by George Frederick Root, which begins: The third stanza of Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, here as the final movement of Bach's chorale cantata > Our lamps are trimmed and burning, > Our robes are white and clean; > We‚Äôve tarried for the Bridegroom, > Oh, may we enter in? The Wise Virgins is a one-act ballet, written in 1941 by William Walton, based on the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, with choreography by Frederick Ashton. \\"Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning\\" is a gospel blues song based on the parable. It has been recorded by such artists as Blind Willie Johnson, Reverend Pearly Brown, and Rev. \\"Blind\\" Gary Davis. Non-religious music has also used the parable as a theme, such as the ballet \\"The wise and the foolish virgins\\" by Swedish composer Kurt Atterberg (1887‚Äì1974), written in 1920. A reference is made to the parable in the 2002 Johnny Cash song \\"The Man Comes Around,\\" which draws heavily on the Bible. On the 1974 album by Genesis - The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, a reference to the parable is made in the song The Carpet Crawlers: \\"and the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright.\\" American composer Emily Freeman-Brown has also composed an oratorio based on the parable. =Drama= From early Christian times, the story of the ten virgins has been told as a mystery play. St Methodius wrote the Banquet of the Ten Virgins,Banquet of the Ten Virgins a mystery play in Greek. Sponsus, a mid-11th-century play, was performed in both Latin and Occitan. The German play Ludus de decem virginibus was first performed on 4 May 1321. There was also a Dutch play of the late Middle Ages.

Biography Peter Malden Studd was the son of Brigadier Malden A. Studd. Sir Peter Studd was the Lord Mayor of the City of London between 1970‚Äì1971 and an executive of De La Rue, the banknote printing company; as a young man he was an outstanding cricketer, captaining both the Harrow and Cambridge teams. Studd was a great nephew of the famous Studd brothers who all captained Cambridge at Cricket. One of the brothers, Kynaston was also Lord Mayor of London. During his mayoralty was the re-opening of the transplanted London Bridge at Lake Havasu City, Arizona. The old bridge, which dated from 1831, had been sold by the City authorities for ¬£1,025,000, and shipped to America to become the centrepiece of a new community. As Alderman Sheriff of the City of London in 1967, Studd and his wife attended the laying of the foundation stone and in October 1970 he returned in full regalia to join the state governor in an opening ceremony which featured a Lord Mayor's procession.See his Telegraph obituary for full details of this project and visit. Peter Malden Studd was born 15 September 1916. Studd's father, Brigadier Malden Studd DSO MC, was ADC to King George VI during the early part of World War II. Like his forebear Sir Kynaston Studd, he was a governor of the Regent Street Poly (now part of the University of Westminster). Between 1973-4 Studd was also a master of the Merchant Taylors' Company, thus maintaining another long-standing Studd family connection. An equally long-standing family connection was English Freemasonry, and Peter Studd was an active member of the organisation, and a Past Master of the Lodge of Assistance No 2773 (London, England).See \\"The History of the Lodge of Assistance 1899-2002\\", published 2002. Positions and honours Amongst his other positions were: * Chairman of the Florence Nightingale Hospital * President of the British Chiropractic Advancement Association * Vice-president of the Arts Educational Schools * Governor of Harrow * Chairman of King George's Jubilee Trust Studd was knighted in 1969 and advanced to GBE in 1971. He was appointed KCVO in 1979 in recognition of his work for the Prince's Trust, and became a Deputy Lieutenant for Wiltshire in 1983. Legacy It was Studd's hope that he might be remembered for his work as leader of the campaign to save the structure of St Paul's Cathedral. The roof and fabric of the building had suffered from the ravages of time and the constant vibration from the London traffic. During his mayoralty he was able to help raise ¬£3 million towards the project and for him was a highlight of his year of office. His fundraising efforts were impressive and he was even able to persuade President Richard Nixon to be the project's patron in America. As a result, money flooded in, including one donation of $10 from an American pensioner who had visited the cathedral during the First World War in 1917.Details on his page at the Cripplegate Ward Club.

Educated at Clare College, Cambridge, and Gray's Inn, he entered Parliament as MP for Aldborough in 1621 and 1624. He was then returned for Richmond in 1625 and 1626 and Thirsk in 1628. His rise to importance was due primarily to his close friendship with Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, who was his distant cousin. Although at first hostile to Charles I, as shown by the active part he took in the impeachment of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Wandesford soon became a royalist partisan, and in 1633 he accompanied Wentworth to Ireland, where he became Master of the Rolls. Wandesford said that he went to Ireland not out of ambition, but simply out of his affection for Wentworth. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Kildare in the Irish Parliaments of 1634 and 1639 and was a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. Wandesford's services to Wentworth were fully recognised by the latter, who wrote that of all the Privy Council he confided only in Wandesford and George Radcliffe, for whose services he could never be sufficiently thankful. In 1640 Wandesford succeeded Strafford as Lord Deputy of Ireland, but he had only just begun to struggle with the problems of his new position when he died, after a short illness which seems to have been a severe fever, on 3 December 1640. The medical treatment he received, which included applying split pigeons to the soles of his feet, is unlikely to have improved his chances of survival.Osborough, W.N. \\"Wills that go missing- the quest for the lost will of Christopher Wandesford, Lord Deputy of Ireland\\" published in Reflections on Law and History Four Courts Press Dublin 2006 p. 9 He had married Alice (1592‚Äì1659), the only daughter of Sir Hewett Osborne and his wife Joyce Fleetwood, and sister to Sir Edward Osborne, 1st Baronet, vice- president, under Wentworth, of the Council of the North. They had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641 his widow and children were forced to flee from their home and after some hardship returned safely to Yorkshire. In the general confusion Wandesford's will disappeared and was not found until 1653: this led to bitter family disputes and years of litigation.Osborough, W.N. pp. 8‚Äì16 Family His son Christopher (1628‚Äì1687), made a baronet in 1662, was the father of Sir Christopher Wandesford, who was created an Irish peer as Viscount Castlecomer in 1707, Castlecomer in Kilkenny having been acquired by his grandfather when in Ireland. Christopher, the 2nd viscount, was Secretary-at-War in 1717‚Äì1718. In 1758 John, 5th viscount, was created Earl Wandesford, but his titles became extinct when he died in January 1784. Wandesford's younger daughter Alice Thornton (1626‚Äì1707) is still remembered for her Autobiography, first published in 1875, which is a valuable source for her father's life and career. Alice married William Thornton in 1651 and had three surviving children. Her elder sister Katherine (died 1645) married Sir Thomas Danby and had sixteen children, of whom ten survived infancy.Osborough p. 11 There were two other surviving sons, John and George. George drowned accidentally near Richmond in 1651.Osborough p. 12 Defence was a priority for Christopher Wandesford, who built a castle in Castlecomer sometime between 1635 and 1640. He had been granted Castlecomer after he argued that the O'Brennans or Brennans who had been there since 1200 held the area without legal right. Because of this he had to build a castle \\"to protect his steward and collieries from the wild Irish\\".William Carrigan, History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory, Vol. II p. 158, quoting from Comber, T., Memoirs of the Life and Death of the Lord Deputy Wandesford (Cambridge, 1778). Apparently he regretted this decision on his death bed and asked that half the rent for the entire area for the last 21 years be repaid to the O'Brennans. This was not done, despite the legal efforts of the clan. Finally in 1686 the Lord Chancellor of Ireland pronounced judgment in their favour, although it seems that this was not the end of the matter.Osborough pp. 15‚Äì16 The Wandesford family were influential in Leinster, lending military aid to suppress the Irish rebellion of 1798 in Enniscorthy. A member of the family also married into the Butler family of Ormonde. Character Strafford's biographer, C. V. Wedgwood, describes Wandesford as shy, self-effacing, tolerant and charitable, a profound thinker, a fine lawyer and a man who was deeply concerned for social justice.Wedgwood, C.V Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford 1593‚Äì1641: A Revaluation Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p. 44 Even though public opinion in Ireland had turned against Strafford's associates in his final months, Wandesford's death was genuinely mourned.Wedgwood p. 324 Notes ;Attribution * References *Thomas Comber, Memoirs of the Life and Death of the Lord Deputy Wandesford (Cambridge, 1778); *Thomas Dunham Whitaker, History of Richmondshire, vol. ii (1823); *The Autobiography of his daughter, Alice Thornton, edited by Charles Jackson for the Surtees Society (Durham, 1875).

Biography She was the eldest daughter of Victor Emmanuel, Duke of Aosta and his wife Maria Teresa of Austria-Este. Her father became King of Sardinia unexpectedly in 1802 when Charles Emmanuel IV abdicated. Her maternal grandparents were Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este. Ferdinand was the third son of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Theresa of Austria. Maria Beatrice was the eldest daughter of Ercole III d'Este and Maria Theresa, Princess of Carrara. In December 1798, Maria Beatrice left Turin with her parents and uncles to escape the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. They fled to Parma, then Florence, and finally settled at Sardinia, the last dominion held by Kingdom of Sardinia. Maria Beatrice spent most of her time at Cagliari in the following thirteen years. On 20 June 1812, Maria Beatrice married her maternal uncle Francis, Archduke of Austria-Este; due to their close relation, a special dispensation was received for their marriage from Pope Pius VII. Maria Beatrice's husband became Francis IV, Duke of Modena, Reggio, and Mirandola on 14 July 1814, thereby elevating Maria Beatrice to the rank of Duchess of Modena. The marriage beget four children: *Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria-Este (14 July 1817 ‚Äì 25 March 1886), married Henri, Count of Chambord. *Francis V, Duke of Modena (1 June 1819 ‚Äì 20 November 1875), married Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria. *Ferdinand Karl Viktor, Archduke of Austria-Este (20 July 1821 ‚Äì 15 December 1849), married Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria (daughter of Archduke Josef Anton of Austria and his third wife Duchess Maria Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg). *Archduchess Maria Beatrix of Austria-Este (13 February 1824 ‚Äì 18 March 1906), married Juan, Count of Montiz√≥n. The couple left Sardinia on 15 July 1813 for Zakynthos Island, and then sailed to Trieste off the east shore of Adriatic Sea, finally reaching Vienna by land. On the invasion of Joachim Murat during The Hundred Days, they fled Modena until 15 May 1815. On the outbreak of revolution, Maria Beatrice had to flee Modena again with her family on 5 February 1831, but with Austrian military assistance the Ducal family was able to return within a year. Maria Beatrice died of a heart condition on 15 September 1840 at Castello del Catajo. Her remains were kept in the Chiesa di San Vincenzo in Modena. She was a Lady of the Austrian Order of the Starry Cross. Through her father, she inherited the Jacobite claim to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland, but like other non-Stuart pretenders, she never asserted her claim. Had she gained the throne she would have been Mary III & II.Mary III & II and Mary IV & III were numbered in such a way because some Jacobites regard Elizabeth I of England as illegitimate, and therefore consider Mary, Queen of Scots, to have been the rightful Queen Mary II of England from the death of Mary I Ancestry References - Category:1792 births Category:1840 deaths Category:19th-century Italian people Category:19th-century Italian women Category:Austria-Este Category:House of Savoy Category:Dames of the Order of the Starry Cross Category:Jacobite pretenders Category:Princesses of Savoy Category:Duchesses of Modena Category:Duchesses of Reggio Category:Duchesses of Massa Category:Princesses of Carrara ","title":"Maria Beatrice of Savoy"},{"id":"2137097","text":"', officially the ' (; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology The municipality is named after the santol trees that used to grow abundantly in the area. The reason is either because there was a proliferation of santol trees in the area, or because the town was where santol fruits were heavily bartered (Kapampangans being fond of 'sinigang' dish). A legend of how the town got its name goes like this: 'A Spanish missionary came to the town for the first time. Upon reaching a roadside corner store, he parked his horse-driven vehicle and inquired from the store keeper the name of the place. A middle-aged woman vendor, believing that the Spanish priest was asking for the name of the fruits she was selling, readily responded in broken Spanish language, Padre, todos dulce Masantol. The priest took from his pocket a pencil and a small diary and wrote down the word mas santol, referring to the name of the place he has visited. At the time, the locality abounded with santol trees, and santol fruits were in season when the priest visited the place.' History =San Miguel de Masantol May 1, 1878= Originally named San Miguel de Masantol and a part of the town of Macabebe, three of the town's leading patriarchs - Manuel Fajardo, Gregorio Bautista, and Juan Lacap - filed a motion on June 26, 1877, to separate the barrios of Bebe, Bulacus, Caingin and Nigui from Macabebe thereby creating a new Spanish pueblo called San Miguel. This new pueblo was approved by Spanish Governor General Domingo Moriones y Murillo and was inaugurated on May 1, 1878. On November 30, 1893, the Catholic Parish of San Miguel was formally acknowledged through a Royal Decree. For a while it came to be known San Miguel Masantol, until popular usage reverted it to the original name. =Balen ning Masantol 1907= On July 26, 1904, Masantol once more became part of Macabebe. However, in 1907, Masantol was again reinstated as a separate independent municipality and this lasted up to the present. =The Battle of Bangkusay Channel The Ruler of Macabebe= Tarik Sulayman Bambalino / Bankau or for some Historians the Unnamed ruler of Macabebe was the indigenous leader of Macabebe from the \\"Masantol area\\", who refused to ally with the Spaniards and therefore mounted an attack against the Spanish forces of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi during the Battle of Bangkusay Channel on June 3, 1571. The Joint Force of Macabebe, Calumpit, Hagonoy and Maynila \\"Old Rajahnate of Maynila under Rajah Sulayman III / Rajah Mura/Muda of Manila\\" were defeated, by the Joint Force of Spanish Armada and Tagalog mercenaries and Tarik Sulayman himself was killed in the Battle, and Consequently, this victory enabled the Spaniards to establish themselves throughout the city \\"Territory of Kingdom of Tondo\\" and its neighboring Kingdoms and towns. =Tragedy= On January 7, 2008, one person drowned, another missing and 40 others were injured due to electric shocks, when a live cable hit the floating pagoda boat in the fluvial festival of Virgen La Purisima Concepcion at Barangay Alauli. chinapost.com.tw, One drowns, 40 injured in Philippine boat mishap =Contemporary history= In 2020, Masantol and the entire Province of Pampanga was placed under community quarantine starting March 15 to May 31 due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, or the NCovid-19.

According to the , it has a population of people. It was also formerly known as Nuevo M√©xico during the Spanish period. History According to folk etymology, the original pre-Hispanic name of the village was purportedly Masicu or Maca-sicu, which the Spaniards spelled as \\"M√©xico\\". It is claimed that this was a reference to an abundance of chico trees. However chico trees are not endemic to the Philippines and were introduced by the Spaniards. Another claim is that it is derived from siku (\\"elbow\\") and was a reference to the elbow-shaped bends of the nearby Abacan and Pampanga Rivers. But there are no records of the town ever being called Masicu. Instead, the origin of the latter name is believed to be simply a common mispronunciation by the locals. According to the Augustinian records in Libros de Gobierno Eclesi√°stico, the town was founded as a river trading port at around 1581 and was originally named Novo M√©xico (the Old Spanish form of Nuevo M√©xico, \\"New Mexico\\") after Mexico City. The Spanish colonists made M√©xico the capital of the newly formed Province of Pampanga. Gaspar de San Agustin wrote that being the capital, M√©xico was one of the most ‚Äúbeautiful and charming‚Äù centers in the province. A lavish church made of stone and tiles, the Parish of Santa Monica, was built in 1581 with Masangsang and Mat√∫lid serving as its visitas. Mexico also formerly included the city of San Fernando, including parts of Angeles City (formerly the barrio San Angelo). In 1660, Don Francisco Maniago, a native leader from M√©xico, led the Pampanga Revolt against the Spanish. It was caused by the imposition of forced labor (polo) and rice tributes (bandala) by the Spanish colonial government. Maniago also inspired similar revolts in neighboring cities. These were suppressed in 1661 by Governor-General Sabiniano Manrique de Lara. The Spanish colonial authorities stripped M√©xico of its political importance after the Pampanga Revolt by moving the provincial capital further downstream to Bacolor. But it retained its strategic economic importance especially among the L√∫sung Chinese and their mestizo descendants. M√©xico was still a regular drop off point of forest products from the upper reaches of the √Åbacan River. It was also a favored destination by merchants from as far north as Pangasinan. By the 18th century, the Chinese traders and their mestizo de sangley descendants living in M√©xico, Guagua and Malabon had formed and maintained business and social alliances with each other. Cascos and sampans maintained the flow of goods along the Malabon-Guagua-M√©xico chain. Like the Chinese section of Manila, the commercial center of M√©xico became known as the Pari√°n. In 1898, General Maximino Hizon, rallied Kapamp√°ngans to fight the Spaniards under Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary banner and ordered the execution of the Parish priests of M√©xico and San Fernando. When the Americans replaced the Spaniards as the new colonists, General Maximino Hizon soon rose up to become supreme commander of all the Philippine Forces in Pampanga. He was captured by the Americans in 1901 and exiled to Guam after refusing to pledge his allegiance to the United States. He died in exile on September 1, 1901.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons Barangays Public market Mexico is administratively subdivided into 43 barangays.

Like the San Jose Matulid chapel, no available documents tell of the exact date and history of the chapel. Notable features of the structure are the saint's niche flanked by decorative columns and carved stone blinds located on rectangular windows of the fa√ßade. Facade of the Sabanilla chapel Religious and cultural traditions *Good Friday rites: The faithful remember the passion and death of Jesus by the pondering om the Seven Last Words of Christ and the \\"Tanggal\\" (a re-enactment of how Jesus‚Äô body was taken down from the cross). After the \\"Prusisyung Pasu at Pamangutcut\\" (Procession of the Scenes and Burial of Christ), the traditional \\"burul\\" (literally means: wake) where the Santo Entierro seems to be in a wake follows. In here, people visit and pray before the image, after which, in the midnight of Good Friday, there is a procession of the Virgen de Soleded (Our Lady of Solitude). This is a ‚Äòsilent procession‚Äô meditating and joining with the Virgin's sorrow and grief. Usually, single men and women join the procession believing that they will be blessed in their opted state of ‚Äòsingle blessedness' in life. *Easter Sunday celebration: The faithful celebrate Easter. During the day, the Filipino tradition of \\"Salubong/Encuentro\\" is done, after which the \\"Pacbung Judas\\" or the burning of Judas' effigy follows. *April 24: This is regarded as the Mexico Day, following the date of the establishment of the town and parish on April 24, 1581. (Also the Feast of the Conversion of Saint Augustine). During the day, the parish organizes the Augustinian Festival as a tribute to the Augustinian forefathers of the town. A procession of different Augustinian saints and blesseds is held. Among the images joining the procession are Saint Monica, Saint Augustine, Saint Nicholas of Tolentino, Saint Rita of Cascia, Saint Thomas of Villanova, Saint John of Sahagun, San William the Hermit, Saint Magdalene of Nagasaki, Saint Ezequiel Moreno and Our Lady of Consolation and Cord. *May 4: Mexico's town fiesta is celebrated in honor of its patron saint, Saint Monica (Mother of Saint Augustine). *September 4: The people of Mexico celebrate the feast of Virgen dela Consolacion y Correa (Our Lady of Consolation and Cord; Patroness of the Augustinian Order) during which they receive blessed cinctures imitating the gesture of the Virgin Mary giving her own cincture to Saint Monica during her grief and sorrow at her son's misgivings. *September 10: The Sanikulas Festival is celebrated in honor of Saint Nicolas de Tolentino. Bread/cookies (a local delicacy in the town with arrowroot as their main ingredient) are eaten. The tradition is inspired by the story of San Nicolas when he was ill for some time and his advancement to old age started to manifest. He was about to die when his superiors asked him to eat a little meat (for he was a vegetarian) to be nourished, after all he is needed by his community and the souls in purgatory, which he had been praying for. Although he wanted to follow the advice of his superiors he also acknowledged the power and value of fasting towards God's merciful love. He then sought the help of the Virgin Mary through a prayer. Moved by his prayers, she appeared with the baby Jesus in her arms. She handed Nicolas a small piece of bread and asked him to dip it in the water contained in a chalice being held by the baby Jesus. Following her advice, he immediately recovered from his illness, and had more strength than he had ever had before. From then on, Nicolas would bless little pieces of bread, which he would hand out among the people for them to be healed. *December 15‚Äì24: Christmas is welcomed by the annual \\"Lubenas Pascu\\". During this celebration, they parade colorful lanterns and decorated carozzas. According to Tantingco, Lubenas came from the word novena, which means nine days, referring to the nine-day simbang gabi. But while the rest of the country was content with attending dawn masses for nine consecutive days, Kapampangans went a step farther by holding a procession on the eve of every simbang gabi with a procession after dinner, which means they slept late, and then woke up before dawn for the simbang gabi (or simbang bengi in Kapampangan).

The town is known for its 400-year-old church, the Santa Monica Parish Church, with its unique design that incorporates pre-colonial architectural motif alongside its European Catholic iconography. Minalin is also known for its \\"Aguman Sanduk\\" New Year's Celebration, where in which the town's straight men dress up as beauty queens and ride through town on festive floats. The town is also referred to as the \\"Egg Basket of Central Luzon\\" because of its large- scale production of eggs and chickens, prompting the town to put up the Philippines' first egg festival in 2008. Etymology Pansomun (grandson of Prince Balagtas, the ruler of the Kapampangan empire and Luzon), in his will, claimed to be a cousin of Rajah Soliman and Lakandula, the chieftains of Manila and Tondo in 1571 (conquest by Spain). Pansomun, as Christian convert Fernando Malang Balagtas signed in 1589 a will on the Kapampangan territory. Pansomun/Balagtas stated that he was born in Tabungao (Santa Maria, the old location of Minalin). The legend of Minalin's name came from \\"minalis la ding dutung, minalis ya ing pisamban\\" (the lumber moved, and so must the church). Lumber stocks at Santa Maria for the church construction were carried by floods to a hilly Burol. Capitan Diego Tolentino wrote \\"minalis\\", thus, the name Minalin evolved. A Malayan settlement of Kahn Bulaun, Prince Balagtas' descendant, also found in the place, beautiful women. The Spaniards called the sitio, \\"mina linda de las mujerers\\" (a mine of beautiful women), which could also be the source of the town's name. Subsequently, Chinese traders abbreviated the words to \\"Minalin\\". Minalin's name might have originated also from \\"minalis\\" (\\"to move to\\"). \\"Mina\\" means mine, a word written on a rock left at the sitio in 1700 by a Spaniard Jos√© Espeleta, and \\"Lin\\", the founder's name. Gobernadorcillo (Mayor) Diego Tolentino wrote Minalin in lieu of Minalis and the Calendario Manual y Guia de Forasteros, 1839 to 1841, spelled Minalin, thus Minalin. In 1860 Minalin was a producer of rice, corn, sugar cane, cacao, indigo (a√±il) and fruits, including dye, nipa wine, vinegar and mats (petates).

The celebration has also been referred to as the \\"Belles of Minalin\\" but Minalin natives prefer to continue calling the event \\"Aguman Sanduk\\", which translates literally as \\"Association of the Ladle\\".The event is differentiated from gay pride parades because the event is specifically intended for heterosexual males, and is intended simply to be an act of fun, rather than a statement about gender. This is an avenue where men from all walks of life cross-dress and dare to step out of their statuses. Whether you are a known public figure, a farmer, or a professional, it is with utmost pride that a man from Minalin will dare step out of his status to give joy (pikatulan) to his people. With the continuous celebration of the festival, it is a living proof of how Minale√±os value camaraderie (pamakiabe). It is the dare that keeps the community‚Äôs bond and strengthen the ties of Minale√±os. This annual display of beautiful dresses and expertise in women‚Äôs make up signifies that this town follows the dynamic changes in women‚Äôs fashion not only in the Philippines but also in Europe, Asia and in other countries. = Egg Festival = On June 4, 2008, Minalin celebrated its fame for producing over a million chicken eggs per day by holding the country's first \\"First Egg Festival.\\" An exhibit of Minalin's egg produce was put up, and a taste test of 10,000 boiled eggs was held.

The Mexican Expeditionary Air Force were given a base around Porac to help liberate the country from the Japanese Empire in World War II. (Marker: October 31, 2008, 412th Anniversary of Porac). Geography Porac is west from the provincial capital San Fernando, south of Angeles and north of Floridablanca. A portion of Mount Pinatubo is in the municipality. Porac has a hilly to mountainous terrain in the majority of its plains. Most rivers, if not all, are heavily silted by mudflow due to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and succeeding lahar flows. Tourist spots include Darabulbul Falls (nicknamed Dara Falls) in Jalung, Miyamit Falls in Sapang Uwak, and the hot springs of Sitio Puning, accessed through Sapang Bato in Angeles. Babo Pangulo offers a view of Porac and Mount Negron. =Barangays= Porac is politically subdivided into 29 barangays. =Climate= The town of Porac has two distinct climates, rainy and dry.

Spanish-era Roman Catholic churches Fa√ßade of Santa Catalina de Alejandria Parish Church Since the founding of the town of Porac in 1867, various Roman Catholic structures have been built in the area to aid in the religious practices of the devout Kapampangans. As of writing, three notable Spanish-era religious structures are extant within the municipality. The largest of the three, the Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church is located at Barangay Poblacion and still functions as one of Porac‚Äôs main parochial structures. The other two are currently utilized as barangay chapels. =Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church= The Santa Catalina de Alejandria parish church is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando. Its original structure, built in 1872, is largely intact but slight revisions have been made to the inside. It underwent restoration in the 1980s.

The Our Lady of Sorrows Chapel was said to be built by the Dolores family within the old Hacienda Dolores in 1856. The chapel, like the Pio chapel, is currently utilized as a community chapel. The chapel boasts of a slender octagonal belfry and Doric columns adorning the two-level fa√ßade. Notable features of the chapel are finials found on both levels of the fa√ßade. Archaeology The area in and around Babo Balukbuk in Porac has strong indications of human habitation, according to investigations published on the University of the Philippines Archaeological Studies Program website.

The church is located in a place that used to be called Cabagsac, referring to the proliferation of fruit bats. In fact, today, a fishnet is permanently installed high above the altar precisely to catch thousands of bats that are roosting inside the church. The interior is dark, has an ambience of antiquity and mystery and overpowering odor of bat urine. The main attraction is the three-tower facade, perhaps one of its kind in the country. Not to be missed is the ancient cemetery located in a hidden corner at the back of the church, with some tombstones dating back to the 1800s and bearing the names of the town's prominent families, including the Elizaldes, Ablazos, Francos, Tarucs, among others.

Ocampo Lansang Delicacies (Turones de Casuy, Sansrival, Uraro). Santa Rita is the home of D√∫man and Ocampo-Lansang Delicacies (Turones de Casuy, Sansrival, Uraro and other sweets that sell in SM City Malls nationwide). D√∫man is made of malagkit rice (lacatan mal√∫t√ª) that is beaten from its husks and toasted in a clay oven. To the rest of the country, it may just be plain green rice or even un-popped pinipig. But it is a prized seasonal food that can be found during the Christmas season, after the rice harvest in November. The younger kernels of rice that don‚Äôt fall off the husks are colored green. These husks are beaten against a hard surface until they fall off. They are then soaked in water, cooked for 30 minutes and then pounded. This rigorous process helps release the sweet oils and nuttiness of the rice.Duman: The Little Known Pampango Treat  OpenRice Philippines Families who produce duman rice are called M√°gdur√∫man. They pass their methods from generation to generation and have kept to the manual production process. Throughout Pampanga, street vendors selling green rice in bilaos or flat baskets are seen. These vendors often sell d√∫man near churches or marketplaces. It can be eaten plain and munched on like popcorn. It can also be snacked on in spoonfuls with sugar, or made into rice cakes. Kapampangans also like adding d√∫man to other dishes like fresh carabao‚Äôs milk or hot chocolate as a breakfast cereal, or even ice cream. Harvested and processed through the end of December, d√∫man is usually eaten with fresh carabao milk (g√°tas dam√∫lag) for breakfast or stirred into sucl√°ti (drinking chocolate made with Philippine cacao). In Santa Rita, a Pampangan municipality and the epicenter of d√∫man production, the eagerly awaited specialty is honored annually with its own festival. Years ago, during d√∫man season, Santa Rita‚Äôs streets rang daily with the ‚Äútok-tok‚Äù of baseball bat-sized wooden pestles hitting meter-high mortars as lacatan mal√∫t√ª, a red- husked variety of glutinous rice, was transformed into d√∫man. Nowadays, only a few barangays engage in the laborious and time-consuming production process. The D√∫man Festival started in 2002, which originated from the long-standing tradition of pounding and winnowing unripe glutinous rice (lacatan). The festival features alfresco dining in front of the Santa Rita Church patio were rows and rows of delicacy stalls would sell various pastries and native dishes of the town with duman being the major highlight. The food sold during the festival would include native pastry attractions of the town like sansrival, masa podrido, mam√≥n and mam√≥n tostado. D√∫man is relatively expensive. Food critic Claude Tayag explains that unlike the regular rice variety, which can be planted and harvested three times a year, d√∫man can only be harvested in the cool air of November and December, otherwise it will not be a bountiful one. For every hectare (San Agust√≠n and Santa M√≥nica), a farmer can produce only a maximum of 4.5 cavans of duman, while a maximum of 300 cavans can be harvested from the regular rice variety. D√∫man prices range from P600 to P1,000 per kilo depending on the quality.10th Duman Festival all set on December 3  Sun.Star[eK!] sta. rita, pampanga, philippines: profile & brief history http://100poundfoodie.com/2007/12/10/scenes-from-the-6th-duman- festival/ File:Duamn78jf.jpgDuman with flowers File:Dumanjf.jpgBlooming duman in November File:Duman2jf.jpgMacro portrait of the grains File:Duman6jf.jpgGreen gold in the bilao =Santa Rita de Casia Parish Church= The heritage Church is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fernando. Fr. Pedro de San Nicolas served as minister of both Porac and Santa Rita in 1722, but it was only in 1726 when Santa Rita had its own priest and therefore became an independent parish. Fr. Francisco Royo built the present church in 1839; Fr. Juan Merino completed it in 1868. These two priests also opened the road linking Santa Rita with Porac and Guagua. During the Revolution, the townspeople hid their last Augustianian parish priest, Fr. Celestino Garcia in their houses until the forces of Gen. Maximino Hizon captured him in Bacolor and took him all the way to Lepanto in the Cordilleras. Building of the church had to be delayed until the late 19th century due to economic adjuristicial conditions. The single-nave church is 55m long, 13m wide and 10m high. It has a large and well lit transept. The solid brass facade has baroque characteristics and the single columns are relatively slender.Pampanga ChurchesDepartment of Tourism - The Philippines Ultimate Travel Guide for Tourist: Santa Rita de Cascia :. .: History of Santa Rita de Cascia Parish :  5 Heritage bells  File:Stritajf83.JPGSanta Rita of Casia Parish Church File:Santaritachurchjf.JPGHeritage Bell tower File:Stritajf7.JPGMain altar File:Altarstritajf.JPGInterior File:Staritachapeljf.JPGChapel (nearby San Vicente) The reliquary The parish is the site where the Holy Relic of Saint Rita de Cascia is enshrined. The parish first obtained the First Class Relic of the saint through the help and assistance of His Excellency, Most Rev. Riccardo Fontana of Spoleto-Norcia, Italy, the archdiocese to which Cascia belongs. Archbishop Fontana forwarded the Relic through the mediation of the Apostolic Nunciature in Manila to Archbishop Paciano Aniceto who in turn handed it over to the parish of Santa Rita de Cascia on August 17, 2008. The First Class Relic is from the flesh ‚Äúex carne‚Äùof the Saint. As noted in its accompanying Certificate of Authenticity, the relic was part of the last batch extracted from the incorrupt body of Saint Rita on 20 August 1972. The reliquary is laid open for public veneration every August 17. St. Rita of Cascia (1381) was born in the Italian town of Roccaporena. When her husband and twin sons died, she entered the Augustinian Nuns. The next 40 years of her life saw St. Rita devoting herself to a life of prayer, and works and deeds of charity as dictated by the rules of St Augustine. At age 60, while meditating before the cross, a wound seeming afflicted by a thorn appeared on her forehead. St. Rita began boring the sign of stigmatization which is considered being one with Jesus. Because of the stigmata, she suffered in pain for the next 15 years which she courageously accepted. St. Rita died on May 22, 1457. Her intact and incorrupt body is kept and honored in the shrine at her hometown on Cascia, Italy.Welcome santaritaparishasf.org - BlueHost.com File:Stritachurch4jf.JPGAltar of St.Joseph File:Stritachurch734jf.JPGAltar of St. Rita de Casia File:Saintritajf.JPGSt. Rita with the Reliquary in her heart File:Stritadecasiajf.JPGCloser photo File:Stritajf9a.JPGAltar of Apparition File:Villaepipaniajf.JPGFa√ßade of Villa Epifania File:Villaepipaniajfd.JPGVilla Epifania: The Grand Old House of Santa Rita File:Villaepipaniajfa.JPGFilm site of \\"Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang\\" & \\"Tanging Yaman\\") File:Stritahall2jf.JPGThe ancestral lot was owned by the Guanzon patriarch Don Agapito Guanzon (Captain Pitong) the then Captain Municipal (equivalent to today‚Äôs municipal mayor) of Santa Rita.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology It was known as Sexmoan until January 15, 1991. The town's former name in Spanish was Sexmo√°n, as was initially transcribed by Spanish friars. In Spanish, the letter used to be pronounced as a voiceless postalveolar fricative / É/, identical to the digraph in English. It was derived from the ancient Kapampangan rootword sasmo, which means to meet, according to a 17th-century Kapampangan dictionary. Sasmuan therefore is synonymous with \\"pitagmuan\\" or \\"meeting place of the datus\\" or \\"meeting point\\". It was named \\"Sasmuan\\" because it is where the Pampangos meet when they were at war with the Chinese in Guagua. In 1991, it was unanimously changed into Sasmuan, since the previous name, Sexmo√°n, denoted a very negative sexual connotation not only to the town, but also to the people living within the town itself due to the inculture of believing that the prefix \\"Sex-\\" had something to do with the English word sex. History Sasmuan already had a well-developed system of government well before the era of Spanish colonization. It evolved to be one of the oldest and major settlements in Pampanga by the 16th century. The Santa Lucia Church was one of the first Roman Catholic churches built in the Philippines by the Spaniards with the political and financial support of the Principalia.

The old town church is one of the few, if not the only church in the country where the single belfry is situated between the church and the convento. The church, which measures long, wide, and high, also features a grotto of Our Lady of Fatima. Devotees from all over the province flock here to honor Saint Lucy, believed to be a miraculous saint. Founded in 1590, Santa Lucia is a parish of the Vicariate of St. Joseph in the Archdiocese of San Fernando. The parish celebrates the feast day of its titular patron on December 13.

According to the , it has a population of people. As the youngest and smallest Pampanga town, Santo Tomas has a total land area of 1,467 hectares. It is a mainly agricultural and fishing community; industry includes casket manufacture, ceramics, and carpentry. Etymology The town's name is derived from Baliwag (\\"tardy\\" in Spanish) a reference to local habit of arriving late for Mass. Baliwag, whose original name was Santo Tomas, had its Patron, St. Thomas the Apostle. He is also called Doubting Thomas or Didymus (meaning \\"twin,\\" as does \\"Thomas\\" in Aramaic) and was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. The Patronal Feast is celebrated yearly on the 21st of December from the town's original founding date of 1792. History On September 15, 1792, Santo Tomas was severed from its parent Minalin, Pampanga. On May 4, 1899, the town was under the U.S. Force's administration. On January 2, 1905, it was ceded to San Fernando, Pampanga until 1905. On October 12, 1951, Executive Order No. 476 (issued by Elpidio Quirino) created Santo Tomas and its five barrios of San Matias, San Vicente, San Bartolome, Santo Rosario and Santo Tomas with the seat of government at barrio San Vicente. On January 11, 1952, the municipality of Santo Tomas was re-inaugurated. The first municipal hall was temporarily at the house of late Mayor Patricio Gomez, the first municipal mayor. In 1955, RA 1250, the San Matias seat was transferred to Santo Tomas. Presidential Decree No. 1441 was issued by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on June 11, 1978, transferring the seat of municipal government from Barangay SantoTomas to Barangay San Vicente. The town became the site of the bloody encounter between Filipino and American forces during Philippine Revolution known as the Battle of Santo Tomas. Geography The municipality of Santo Tomas, the smallest town in Pampanga, is at the heart of the province. The capital city of San Fernando bounds it on the north-west the municipality of San Simon on the north-east, the municipality of Minalin on the south-east and Bacolor on the west. =Barangays= Santo Tomas is politically subdivided into seven barangays: * Moras De La Paz * Santo Tomas * San Bartolome * San Matias * San Vicente * Santo Rosario (Pau) * Sapa (Santo Ni√±o) =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Santo Tomas, Pampanga, was people, with a density of .

Summary The book is a biography of King Alexander the Great, (356-323 BCE/BC), ruler of Macedon, Egypt and Persia. Renault wrote several historical novels in which Alexander appears: The Mask of Apollo (1966), Fire from Heaven (1969), The Persian Boy (1972) and Funeral Games (1981). She felt these were not enough to tell the whole story of Alexander, and so she completed her nonfiction biography. The book makes no attempt to be impartial or neutral, but rather unabashedly advocates Alexander as a truly great man. For example, Renault rejects the usual terminology of the \\"murder\\" of Kleitos, pointing out that legally, \\"murder\\" refers only to a killing with premeditation, which absolutely was not the case when the King killed Kleitos in a drunken brawl, after much drink and much provocation. She also points out that the beauty of the mummy of Alexander was still much admired even many generations after his death. She refutes many slurs against Alexander, both ancient and modern. Renault also defends Alexander's friend Hephaistion, pointing out that he corresponded with Aristotle and was successful in every mission and independent command he undertook.

According to the , it has a population of people. History =Spanish period= The area of Atok was previously referred to by the natives and Spanish colonizers as Chontog, an Ibaloi word for \\"mountainous\\". Spanish military officials and missionaries arrived at Chontog in 1892, establishing precedencias (tax collection stations) in the area and its surrounding settlements. The Ibaloi phrase Nay patok shi Chontog, which means \\"on the mountain top\\", was later shortened to Atok. =American period= During the American rule, Atok was established as one of the 19 townships of the province of Benguet, upon the issuance of Act No. 48 by the Philippine Commission on November 22, 1900. On August 13, 1908, Benguet was established as a sub-province of the newly created Mountain Province with the enactment of Act No. 1876. As a result, six townships of Benguet were abolished, but Atok remained a constituent town of Benguet sub-province. =World War II= During the Second World War, Atok was the scene of fierce pitch battles between the military forces of the 1st, 2nd, 12th, 13th, 15th and 16th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 1st Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, the USAFIP-NL 66th Infantry Regiments, the Igorot and Cordilleran guerrilla fighters and the Japanese Imperial Army forces. The steep terrain along the Halsema road suited Filipino troops, the Philippine Commonwealth military, and guerrillas to mount ambushes against the Japanese forces. One of these battles took place in what is now ‚ÄúGuerrilla Saddle‚Äù located at km. 26, in barangay Caliking. =Post-war era= On June 25, 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Executive Order No. 42 converting eight (8) of the thirteen (13) towns (designated as municipal districts) of Benguet into regular municipalities. Atok was among them. On June 18, 1966, the sub-province of Benguet was separated from the old Mountain Province and was converted into a regular province. Atok remained to be a component municipality of the newly established province. Geography Atok is located at , situated at the central portion of Benguet. It is bounded by Kibungan on the north, Kabayan on the north-east, Bokod on the southeast, Tublay on the south-west, and Kapangan on the west. Highest point in the Philippine Highway System marker along Halsema Highway According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Benguet. The land is characterized as mountainous with many steep cliffs. It is home to Mt. Timbak, the third highest mountain in Luzon. The second highest point in the Philippine Highway System is also located at Barangay Paoay along Halsema Highway, at above sea level. It held formerly the title as the highest point in the Philippine Highway System since World War II until early 2019. This is after the validation and assessment conducted by the Department of Public Works and Highways - Cordillera Administrative Region (DPWH-CAR) Regional Office last January 2019 declaring a new highest point at 2,428.66 meters (7968.045 feet) along the Kiangan-Tinoc-Buguias Road in Tinoc Town some 55 Kilometers east via Atok, Benguet. Atok is from Baguio City. =Climate= During the cold months of the year, the municipality experiences very low temperatures reaching .

It generates a sequence of pseudorandom numbers and combines it with the data using the XOR operator. The key length may vary, but is generally 128 bits. Description At each iteration, E0 generates a bit using four shift registers of differing lengths (25, 31, 33, 39 bits) and two internal states, each 2 bits long. At each clock tick, the registers are shifted and the two states are updated with the current state, the previous state and the values in the shift registers. Four bits are then extracted from the shift registers and added together. The algorithm XORs that sum with the value in the 2-bit register. The first bit of the result is output for the encoding. E0 is divided in three parts: # Payload key generation # Keystream generation # Encoding The setup of the initial state in Bluetooth uses the same structure as the random bit stream generator. We are thus dealing with two combined E0 algorithms. An initial 132-bit state is produced at the first stage using four inputs (the 128-bit key, the Bluetooth address on 48 bits and the 26-bit master counter). The output is then processed by a polynomial operation and the resulting key goes through the second stage, which generates the stream used for encoding. The key has a variable length, but is always a multiple of 2 (between 8 and 128 bits). 128 bit keys are generally used. These are stored into the second stage's shift registers. 200 pseudorandom bits are then produced by 200 clock ticks, and the last 128 bits are inserted into the shift registers. It is the stream generator's initial state. Cryptanalysis Several attacks and attempts at cryptanalysis of E0 and the Bluetooth protocol have been made, and a number of vulnerabilities have been found. In 1999, Miia Hermelin and Kaisa Nyberg showed that E0 could be broken in 264 operations (instead of 2128), if 264 bits of output are known. This type of attack was subsequently improved by Kishan Chand Gupta and Palash Sarkar. Scott Fluhrer, a Cisco Systems employee, found a theoretical attack with a 280 operations precalculation and a key search complexity of about 265 operations. He deduced that the maximal security of E0 is equivalent to that provided by 65-bit keys, and that longer keys do not improve security. Fluhrer's attack is an improvement upon earlier work by Golic, Bagini and Morgari, who devised a 270 operations attack on E0. In 2000, the Finn Juha Vainio showed problems related to misuse of E0 and more generally, possible vulnerabilities in Bluetooth. In 2004, Yi Lu and Serge Vaudenay published a statistical attack requiring the 24 first bits of 235 Bluetooth frames (a frame is 2745 bits long). The final complexity to retrieve the key is about 240 operations. The attack was improved to 237 operations for precomputation and 239 for the actual key search. In 2005, Lu, Meier and Vaudenay published a cryptanalysis of E0 based on a conditional correlation attack. Their best result required the first 24 bits of 223.8 frames and 238 computations to recover the key. The authors assert that \\"this is clearly the fastest and only practical known-plaintext attack on Bluetooth encryption compare with all existing attacks\\".

It is mathematically identical to the more commonly used long multiplication algorithm, but it breaks the process into smaller steps, which some practitioners find easier to use. The method had already arisen by medieval times, and has been used for centuries in many different cultures. It is still being taught in certain curricula today.Boag, Elizabeth, ‚ÄúLattice Multiplication,‚Äù BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics 22:3 (Nov. 2007), p. 182.Nugent, Patricia M., ‚ÄúLattice Multiplication in a Preservice Classroom‚Äù, Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School 13:2 (Sept. 2007), pp. 110-113.  Method  A grid is drawn up, and each cell is split diagonally. The two multiplicands of the product to be calculated are written along the top and right side of the lattice, respectively, with one digit per column across the top for the first multiplicand (the number written left to right), and one digit per row down the right side for the second multiplicand (the number written top-down). Then each cell of the lattice is filled in with product of its column and row digit. As an example, consider the multiplication of 58 with 213. After writing the multiplicands on the sides, consider each cell, beginning with the top left cell. In this case, the column digit is 5 and the row digit is 2. Write their product, 10, in the cell, with the digit 1 above the diagonal and the digit 0 below the diagonal (see picture for Step 1). If the simple product lacks a digit in the tens place, simply fill in the tens place with a 0. Step 1 After all the cells are filled in this manner, the digits in each diagonal are summed, working from the bottom right diagonal to the top left. Each diagonal sum is written where the diagonal ends. If the sum contains more than one digit, the value of the tens place is carried into the next diagonal (see Step 2). Step 2 Numbers are filled to the left and to the bottom of the grid, and the answer is the numbers read off down (on the left) and across (on the bottom). In the example shown, the result of the multiplication of 58 with 213 is 12354. Step 3  Multiplication of decimal fractions  The lattice technique can also be used to multiply decimal fractions. For example, to multiply 5.8 by 2.13, the process is the same as to multiply 58 by 213 as described in the preceding section. To find the position of the decimal point in the final answer, one can draw a vertical line from the decimal point in 5.8, and a horizontal line from the decimal point in 2.13. (See picture for Step 4.) The grid diagonal through the intersection of these two lines then determines the position of the decimal point in the result. In the example shown, the result of the multiplication of 5.8 and 2.13 is 12.354. Step 4 History Lattice multiplication has been used historically in many different cultures. It is not known where it arose first, nor whether it developed independently within more than one region of the world.Jean-Luc Chabert, ed., A History of Algorithms: From the Pebble to the Microchip (Berlin: Springer, 1999), p. 21. The earliest recorded use of lattice multiplication:Jean-Luc Chabert, ed., A History of Algorithms: From the Pebble to the Microchip (Berlin: Springer, 1999), pp. 21-26. * in Arab mathematics was by Ibn al-Banna' al-Marrakushi in his Talkhƒ´·π£ a‚ÄòmƒÅl al-·∏•isƒÅb, in the Maghreb in the late 13th century * in European mathematics was by the unknown author of a Latin treatise in England, Tractatus de minutis philosophicis et vulgaribus, c. 1300 * in Chinese mathematics was by Wu Jing in his Jiuzhang suanfa bilei daquan, completed in 1450. The mathematician and educator David Eugene Smith asserted that lattice multiplication was brought to Italy from the Middle East.Smith, David Eugene, History of Mathematics, Vol. 2, ‚ÄúSpecial Topics of Elementary Mathematics‚Äù (New York: Dover, 1968). This is reinforced by noting that the Arabic term for the method, shabakh, has the same meaning as the Italian term for the method, gelosia, namely, the metal grille or grating (lattice) for a window. It is sometimes erroneously stated that lattice multiplication was described by Mu·∏•ammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al- KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ (Baghdad, c. 825) or by Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci (Italy, 1202, 1228).The original 1202 version of Liber Abaci is lost. The 1228 version was later published in its original Latin in Boncompagni, Baldassarre, Scritti di Leonardo Pisano, vol. 1 (Rome: Tipografia delle Scienze Matematiche e Fisiche, 1857); an English translation of the same was published by Sigler, Laurence E., Fibonacci‚Äôs Liber Abaci: A Translation into Modern English of Leonardo Pisano‚Äôs Book of Calculation (New York: Springer Verlag, 2002). In fact, however, no use of lattice multiplication by either of these two authors has been found. In Chapter 3 of his Liber Abaci, Fibonacci does describe a related technique of multiplication by what he termed quadrilatero in forma scacherii (‚Äúrectangle in the form of a chessboard‚Äù). In this technique, the square cells are not subdivided diagonally; only the lowest-order digit is written in each cell, while any higher-order digit must be remembered or recorded elsewhere and then \\"carried\\" to be added to the next cell. This is in contrast to lattice multiplication, a distinctive feature of which is that each cell of the rectangle has its own correct place for the carry digit; this also implies that the cells can be filled in any order desired. SwetzSwetz, Frank J., Capitalism and Arithmetic: The New Math of the 15th Century, Including the Full Text of the Treviso Arithmetic of 1478, Translated by David Eugene Smith (La Salle, IL: Open Court, 1987), pp. 205-209. compares and contrasts multiplication by gelosia (lattice), by scacherii (chessboard), and other tableau methods. Other notable historical uses of lattice multiplication include: * Jamshƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´‚Äôs MiftƒÅ·∏• al-·∏•isƒÅb (Samarqand, 1427), in which the numerals used are sexagesimal (base 60), and the grid is turned 45 degrees to a ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù orientation * the Arte dell‚ÄôAbbaco, an anonymous text published in the Venetian dialect in 1478, often called the Treviso Arithmetic because it was printed in Treviso, just inland from Venice, Italy * Luca Pacioli‚Äôs Summa de arithmetica (Venice, 1494) * the Indian astronomer Ga·πáe≈õa's commentary on BhƒÅskara II‚Äôs LilƒÅvati (16th century).

Dual format is a technique used to allow two completely different systems software to reside on the same disk. The term was used on the Amiga and Atari ST platform to indicate that the disk could be inserted into either machine and it would still boot and run. The secret behind this lies in a very special layout of the first track of the disk which contained an Amiga and an Atari ST bootsector at the same time by fooling the operating system to think that the track resolved into the format it expected. Only a few games used that technique. Three of them were produced by Eclipse Software Design (Stone Age, Monster Business and Lethal Xcess). ST/Amiga Format magazine also used the technique for their coverdisks. Amiga and PC dual-format games also existed, like the budget version of Rick Dangerous. The game 3D Pool even contained a Tri-format disk, which contained the Amiga, Atari ST and PC versions of the game.

He was also a personal secretary to Leon Trotsky from 1932 to 1939, and from then until 1947, an American Trotskyist activist. Life Van Heijenoort was born in Creil, France. His family's financial circumstances were difficult as his Dutch immigrant father died when van Heijenoort was two. He nevertheless acquired a powerful traditional French formal education, to which his French writings attest. (He also published in Spanish.) Although he eventually became a naturalized American citizen, he visited France twice a year from 1958 until his death, and remained very attached to his French extended family and friends. =Political views= In 1932, he joined the Trotskyist movement (recruited by Yvan Craipeau) and the Communist League. Very soon thereafter, the recently exiled Trotsky hired van Heijenoort as a secretary and bodyguard, primarily because of his fluency in French, Russian, German, and English. Thus began seven years in Trotsky's household, during which he served as an all-purpose translator, helping Trotsky write several books and keep up an extensive intellectual and political correspondence in several languages. In 1939, van Heijenoort moved to New York City to be with his second wife, Beatrice \\"Bunny\\" Guyer, where he worked for the Socialist Workers Party (US) (SWP) and wrote a number of articles for the American Trotskyist press and other radical outlets. He was elected to the secretariat of the Fourth International in 1940 but resigned when Felix Morrow and Albert Goldman, with whom he had sided, were expelled from the SWP. Goldman subsequently went on to join the US Workers Party but Morrow joined no other party/grouping. In 1947, he too was expelled from the SWP. In 1948, he published an article, called \\"A Century's Balance Sheet\\" in which he criticized that part of Marxism which saw the \\"proletariat\\" as the revolutionary class. He continued to hold other parts of Marxism as true. Van Heijenoort was spared the ordeal of McCarthyism because everything he published in Trotskyist organs appeared under one or other of more than a dozen pen names. Moreover, Feferman (1993) states that van Heijenoort the logician was quite reticent about his Trotskyist youth, and did not discuss politics. Nevertheless, in the last decade of his life he contributed to the history of the Trotskyist movement by writing the monograph With Trotsky in Exile (1978), editing a volume of Trotsky's correspondence (1980), and advising and working with the archivists at the Houghton Library in Harvard University, which holds many of Trotsky's papers from his years in exile. =Academic work= After completing a Ph.D. in mathematics at New York University in 1949 under the supervision of J. J. Stoker, he taught mathematics there but evolved into a logician and philosopher of mathematics, in good part because of the influence of Georg Kreisel. He began teaching philosophy, first part-time at Columbia University, then full-time at Brandeis University, 1965-77. He spent much of his last decade at Stanford University, writing and editing eight books, including parts of the Collected Works of Kurt G√∂del. The Source Book (van Heijenoort 1967), his book on the history of logic and of the foundations of mathematics, is an anthology of translations. It begins with the first complete translation of Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift, which is followed by 45 historically important short pieces on mathematical logic and axiomatic set theory, originally published between 1889 and 1931. The anthology ends with G√∂del's landmark paper on the incompletability of Peano arithmetic. For more information on the period covered by this anthology, see Grattan-Guinness (2000). Nearly all the content of the Source Book was difficult to access in all but the best North American university libraries (e.g., even the Library of Congress did not acquire a copy of the Begriffsschrift until 1964), and all but four pieces had to be translated from one of six continental European languages. When possible, the author of the original text was asked to review the translation of his work, and suggest corrections and amendments. Each piece included editorial footnotes, all references were combined into one list, and many misprints, inconsistencies, and errors in the originals were corrected. Especially important are the remarkable introductions to each translation, most written by van Heijenoort himself. A few were written by Willard Quine and Burton Dreben. The Source Book did much to advance the view that modern logic begins with, and builds on, the Begriffsschrift. Grattan-Guinness (2000) argues that this perspective on the history of logic is mistaken, because Frege employed an idiosyncratic notation and was far less read than, say, Peano. Ironically, van Heijenoort (1967a) is often cited by those who prefer the alternative model theoretic stance on logic and mathematics. Much of the history of that stance, whose leading lights include George Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, Ernst Schr√∂der, Leopold L√∂wenheim, Thoralf Skolem, Alfred Tarski, and Jaakko Hintikka, is covered in Brady (2000). The Source Book underrated the algebraic logic of De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, and Schr√∂der, but devoted more pages to Skolem than to anyone other than Frege, and included L√∂wenheim (1915), the founding paper on model theory. =Personal life= Van Heijenoort had children with two of his four wives. While living with Trotsky in Coyoac√°n, now a neighborhood of Mexico City, van Heijenoort's first wife left him after clashing with Trotsky's spouse. Van Heijenoort was also one of Frida Kahlo's lovers; in the film Frida, he is played by Felipe Fulop. Having parted company with Trotsky in 1939 for personal reasons, van Heijenoort was innocent of all circumstances leading to Trotsky's 1940 murder. Van Heijenoort himself was also murdered, in Mexico City 46 years later, by his estranged fourth spouse whom he was visiting at the time. She then took her own life.

Background  The Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law (\\"Foundation\\") applied for a declaration to strike-down section 43 of the Criminal Code which states, under the section entitled \\"Protection of Persons in Authority\\", The basis of which is because the provision violates: # section 7 of the Canadian Charter because it fails to give procedural protections to children, does not further the best interests of the child, and is both overbroad and vague; # section 12 of the Charter because it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment or treatment; # section 15(1) of the Charter because it denies children the legal protection against assaults that is accorded to adults.  Ruling  The Supreme Court handed down its 6 to 3 decision on January 30, 2004. The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice McLachlin with Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache and LeBel JJ. concurring. = Section 7 = Section 7 protects individuals from violation of their personal security. McLachlin found that there was no violation of the section. The Crown had conceded that the law adversely affected the child's security of person, so the issue was whether the violation offended a principle of fundamental justice. The Foundation proposes three claims as mentioned above. McLachlin rejected the first claim that it failed to give procedural protection as children receive all the same protection as anyone else. On the second claim, she rejects that the \\"best interests of the child\\" is a principle of fundamental justice as there is no \\"consensus that it is vital or fundamental to our societal notion of justice.\\" On the third claim she rejects the claim that the law is vague and overbroad on grounds that the law \\"delineates a risk zone for criminal sanction\\". She examines the meaning of \\"reasonable under the circumstances\\" stating that it includes only \\"minor corrective force of a transitory and trifling nature\\", but it does not include \\"corporal punishment of children under two or teenagers\\", or \\"degrading, inhuman or harmful conduct\\" such as \\"discipline by the use of objects\\", \\"blows or slaps to the head\\" or acts of anger. The test is purely objective, McLachlin claims. = Section 12 = Section 12 prevents \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". Citing the standard of showing cruel and unusual punishment from R. v. Smith [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045 as \\"so excessive as to outrage standards of decency\\", McLachlin rejects the claim as the section only permits \\"corrective force that is reasonable\\" thus cannot be excessive by definition. = Section 15(1) = Section 15(1) is the equality guarantee that protects individuals from discrimination. McLachlin examines the claim using the analytical framework from Law v. Canada. When identifying from whose perspective the analysis must be, McLachlin notes that rather than take the perspective of a young child, which would prove too difficult, it must be viewed from the perspective of a \\"reasonable person acting on behalf of a child\\" and apprised of the law. McLachlin says that the claim hinges on demonstrating the lack of \\"correspondence between the distinction and the claimant's characteristics or circumstances\\" (the second contextual factor from the Law v. Canada test). On this point she acknowledges that children need to be protected, and in furtherance of this goal parents and teachers require protection as well. Section 43 decriminalizes \\"only minimal force of transient or trivial impact\\" and to remove such protection would be dangerous as it would criminalize acts such as \\"placing an unwilling child in a chair for a five-minute \\"time-out\\"\\" which would risk destroying the family.

Although the common names in various languages refer to the species as a \\"pine\\", it does not belong in the genus Pinus.  Origin and taxonomy  The genus Araucaria was part of terrestrial flora since the Triassic and found its apogee in Gondwana. Today, it is restricted to the Southern Hemisphere and has 19 species. Distribution Covering an original area of , it has now lost an estimated 97% of its habitat to logging, agriculture, and silviculture. Araucaria angustifolia in Campos do Jord√£oIt is native to southern Brazil (also found in high-altitude areas of southern Minas Gerais, in central Rio de Janeiro and in the east and south of S√£o Paulo, but more typically in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). According to a study made by the Brazilian researcher Maack, the original area of occurrence represented 36.67% of the Paran√° state (), 60.13% of the Santa Catarina state (), 21.6% of the S√£o Paulo state () and 17.38% of the Rio Grande do Sul state (). It is also found in the northeast of Argentina (Misiones and Corrientes), locally in Paraguay (Alto Paran√°), growing in low mountains at altitudes of and in northern regions of Uruguay where it was thought to be extinct until recent discoveries. The prehistoric distribution of A. angustifolia in earlier geologic periods was very different to the present day, fossils were found in the Northeast Region, Brazil. The present day range is recent, the species moving into this area during the later Pleistocene and early Holocene. This chorological shift may possibly be due to climatic change and the migration of mountain flora by way of river courses.M√ºller-Starck, Gerhard & Schubert, Roland.

Dispon√≠vel em Amaivos, acesso 24 fev 2011 Description A very young Araucaria angustifoliaIt is an evergreen tree growing to tall and diameter at breast height. However, the largest individual, near Nova Petropolis, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil is 147.7 feet (45 meters) in height with a D.B.H. (diameter at breast height) of 12.5 feet (twelve meters girth). The leaves are thick, tough and scale like, triangular, long, broad at the base, and with razor-sharp edges and tip. They persist 10 to 15 years, so cover most of the tree except for the trunk and older branches. It is closely related to Araucaria araucana from further southwest in South America, differing most conspicuously in the narrower leaves. It is usually dioecious, with the male and female cones on separate trees. The male (pollen) cones are oblong, long at first, expanding to long by broad at pollen release. Like all conifers it is wind pollinated. The female cones (seed), which mature in autumn about 18 months after pollination, are globose, large, in diameter, and hold about 100‚Äì150 seeds. The cones disintegrate at maturity to release the approximately long nut-like seeds, which are then dispersed by animals, notably the azure jay, Cyanocorax caeruleus. The inner bark and resin from the trunk of the tree is reddish, which can be a good defining character because it differs from A. araucana, which has brown bark inner and white resin. Habitat and ecology It prefers well drained, slightly acidic soil but will tolerate almost any soil type provided drainage is good. It requires a subtropical climate with abundant rainfall, tolerating occasional frosts down to about . Cerro Largo, Uruguay. The seeds are very important for the native animals. Several mammals and birds eat , and it has an important ecological role in Araucaria moist forests (a sub-type of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest). In a long term study observing the feeding behaviour throughout the year of the squirrel Guerlinguetus brasiliensis ssp. ingrami in a secondary A. angustifolia forest in the Parque Recreativo Primavera in the vicinity of the city of Curitiba, Paran√°, of the ten plant species of which the squirrel ate the seeds or nuts, seeds of A. angustifolia were the most important food item in the fall, with a significant percentage of their diet in the winter consisting of the seeds as well. The squirrels cache seeds, but it is unclear how this affects recruitment. Human use Araucaria angustifolia cones () and nuts () 217x217px It is a popular garden tree in subtropical areas, planted for its unusual effect of the thick, 'reptilian' branches with a very symmetrical appearance. The seeds, similar to large pine nuts, are edible, and are extensively harvested in southern Brazil (Paran√°, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states), an occupation particularly important for the region's small population of natives (the Kaing√°ng and other Southern J√™). The seeds, called are popular as a winter snack. The city of Lages, in Santa Catarina state, holds a popular fair, in which mulled wine and boiled Araucaria seeds are consumed. of seeds are collected annually in Brazil. It is also used as a softwood timber in stair treads and joinery. The species is widely used in folk medicine. Conservation According to one calculation it has lost an estimated 97% of its habitat to logging, agriculture, and silviculture in the last century. People also eat the seeds, which may reduce recruitment. It was therefore listed by the IUCN as 'vulnerable in 1998 and 'critically endangered' in 2008.

Bologhine, a suburb in the city of Algiers, is named after him.  Biography  While his father Ziri ibn Menad was emir of the central Maghreb, Buluggin ibn Ziri founded the city of Algiers on the site of the ancient Roman Icosium in 960, but also M√©d√©a and Miliana. He also rebuilt the villages destroyed by the various revolts. On the death of his father, in a battle against Kharidjite Berber tribes in 971, he inherited power. The Fatimid Caliph Al- Mu'izz li-Din Allah appointed Buluggin ibn Ziri as Emir of the Maghreb. In addition to the attributions of his father Menad Abu Ziri, he received the regions of Zab and M'Sila that the defector Dja\`far ibn \`Ali ruled. The honours that were bestowed on him would provoke the jealousy of the Kutamas. Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah left the governance of Sicily and Tripoli to members of his family. Buluggin continues the fight against the Zenatas. The Maghrawa ask for the help of the Umayyads of Cordoba to take back their territory and their cities. Buluggin then took control of almost all of the Maghreb following the directives of the Fatimid Caliph. His orders were to kill all the Zenatas and to collect taxes from the Berbers under threat of force. Buluggin molested the Maghrawa, the Hawwaras (branch of the Branis), the Nefzawas (branch of the Zenatas) and the Mazata. The prisoners were resettled in great numbers in the settlement of Ashir. The Fatimids transfer their court from Mahdia to Cairo. Buluggin was then appointed viceroy of Ifriqiya with Kairouan as its capital. The Fatimids had taken the treasury and fleet with them to Egypt, so the first priority of the Zirid government was to consolidate their rule. However the loss of the fleet meant loss of control over the Kalbids in Sicily. Buluggin advanced towards the Atlantic Ocean during a campaign in Morocco, where he also fought against the Bargawata. The Caliphate of C√≥rdoba was however able to retain the fortresses of Ceuta and Tangiers. Nevertheless Buluggin remained a vassal of the Fatimids to whom he had to pay tribute, he remained surrounded by advisors who were there to support him as much as to watch over him. The Fatimids took with them wealth and military equipment. The absolute priority of the Zirids was therefore to strengthen their power, but the displacement of the Fatimid fleet towards Egypt made the conservation of the Kalbide territories in Sicily impossible. Bologhine Ziri received from the Caliph the titles of Abu al-Futuh, \\"Father of Victories\\" and Sayf ad-Dawla \\"Sword of Empire\\". In 977, Abu Mansur Nizar al-Aziz Billah, successor of Al-Muizz li-D√Æn Allah, attributes to Bologhine the cities of Tripoli, Ajdabiya and Sirte in addition to his previous attributions. He conquers Fez, Sijilmassa and but stops before Ceuta. When he saw the square, which he considered impregnable, and the reinforcements of the Zenatas coming from Andalusia by sea. He turns back. He punished the sovereign of the Barghawata who was declared prophet in an expedition in 980 or 981. In May 984, Bologhine died, his son Al-Mansur succeeded him in all his attributions.

She participated in the Battle of Algeciras, the Battle of Cape Finisterre and several other actions before the British captured her at the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November 1805. The British took her into service as HMS Brave. She was sold to be broken up in April 1816. French service On 6 July 1801 she fought in the Battle of Algeciras under Captain Landais Lalonde, who was killed in the action. Command then transferred to capitaine de fr√©gate Amable Troude, formerly second in command of Dessaix. Naval combat between the French ship Formidable commanded by Captain Troude, and three British naval ships, Caesar, Spencer, Venerable and the frigate Thames in sight of C√°diz, 13 July 1801 On 13 July, as she sailed isolated behind the French fleet, she was chased by the frigate and the ships of the line (74), (80) and (74). She allowed Venerable catch up and took her under heavy fire, leaving her dismasted and in danger of sinking. The rest of the British squadron had to come to aid Venerable, allowing Formidable to escape to C√°diz, acclaimed by the population. Troude was immediately promoted to capitaine de vaisseau. Bonaparte later met with him and called him \\"the French Horatius\\". In 1802 and 1803, Formidable served in Toulon under Admiral Latouche Tr√©ville. On 17 January 1805 she went to sea under Admiral Villeneuve, together with ten other ships of the line and eight frigates, and on 20 January the fleet sailed for Martinique in the Caribbean Sea, which it reached on 13 May. The fleet captured Diamond Rock from the British, but Villeneuve returned to Europe on hearing that Nelson had arrived in the West Indies. On 22 June 1805, the returning Franco-Spanish fleet was intercepted by a British fleet under Sir Robert Calder, resulting in the Battle of Cape Finisterre. After a violent artillery exchange and the capture of two of the Spanish ships, the fleets were separated in the fog. Exhausted after six months at sea, the fleet anchored in C√°diz to rest and refit. With his command under question and planning to meet the British fleet to gain a decisive victory, Villeneuve left C√°diz and met the British fleet near Cape Trafalgar. Formidable was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, who commanded the six-ship vanguard of the French fleet, along with Formidable, , Duguay-Trouin, , and . The vanguard was kept as a reserve, and joined the battle around 16:00. They only sailed close to the battle and fired a few shots. On 4 November 1805 at the Battle of Cape Ortegal, Admiral Sir Richard Strachan, with , , , and four frigates, defeated and captured what remained of the squadron. Formidable was taken and commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Brave. Fate \\"Brave\\" was used as a prison hulk at Plymouth for the remainder of the war. Brave was broken up in 1816.

The attack was published in 1999 by David Wagner, who used it to break the COCONUT98 cipher. The boomerang attack has allowed new avenues of attack for many ciphers previously deemed safe from differential cryptanalysis. Refinements on the boomerang attack have been published: the amplified boomerang attack, then the rectangle attack. Due to the similarity of a Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction with a block cipher, this attack may also be applicable to certain hash functions such as MD5. The attack The boomerang attack is based on differential cryptanalysis. In differential cryptanalysis, an attacker exploits how differences in the input to a cipher (the plaintext) can affect the resultant difference at the output (the ciphertext). A high-probability \\"differential\\" (that is, an input difference that will produce a likely output difference) is needed that covers all, or nearly all, of the cipher. The boomerang attack allows differentials to be used which cover only part of the cipher. The attack attempts to generate a so-called \\"quartet\\" structure at a point halfway through the cipher. For this purpose, say that the encryption action, E, of the cipher can be split into two consecutive stages, E0 and E1, so that E(M) = E1(E0(M)), where M is some plaintext message. Suppose we have two differentials for the two stages; say, :\\\\Delta\\\\to\\\\Delta^* for E0, and : abla\\\\to abla^* for E1‚àí1 (the decryption action of E1). The basic attack proceeds as follows: * Choose a random plaintext P and calculate P' = P \\\\oplus \\\\Delta. * Request the encryptions of P and P' to obtain C = E(P) and C' = E(P') * Calculate D = C \\\\oplus abla and D' = C' \\\\oplus abla * Request the decryptions of D and D' to obtain Q = E^{-1}(D) and Q' = E^{-1}(D') * Compare Q and Q'; when the differentials hold, Q \\\\oplus Q' = \\\\Delta. Application to specific ciphers One attack on KASUMI, a block cipher used in 3GPP, is a related-key rectangle attack which breaks the full eight rounds of the cipher faster than exhaustive search (Biham et al., 2005). The attack requires 254.6 chosen plaintexts, each of which has been encrypted under one of four related keys, and has a time complexity equivalent to 276.1 KASUMI encryptions.

The branding is used for reprints of popular, top-selling games for each console in the PlayStation family, which are deliberately sold with a lower MSRP than the original production runs of a game, and feature special branding‚Äîcolored in red since PlayStation 2‚Äîon their box art, as well as red- colored cases on PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 releases (instead of the traditional clear or blue-colored casing). Equivalent programs exist in Europe and Oceania (as \\"Essentials\\"), Japan and select Asian countries (as \\"The Best\\"), South Korea (as \\"BigHit\\"), and in South America (as \\"Favoritos\\"). PlayStation Hits is used as the branding label for PlayStation 4 games in North America, Brazil, Europe, Oceania, Japan, and select Asian countries. History When Sony introduced the program for PlayStation in March 1997, games could become Greatest Hits titles after selling at least 150,000 copies and being on the market for at least a year. Minimum sales required eventually rose to 250,000. When the program came to PlayStation 2 in 2002, games could become Greatest Hits titles after selling at least 400,000 copies and being on the market for at least one year. Suggested retail prices of Greatest Hits titles were initially $24.99, but they now typically retail for $19.99. Though Sony-developed games are virtually guaranteed to eventually become Greatest Hits titles by meeting their sales and age requirements, 3rd party developers are not required to release their titles with a Greatest Hits label even if said titles meet the criteria. Additionally, Sony allows 3rd party developers some flexibility in the pricing of their own Greatest Hits titles, but most of them stick to the agreed-upon suggested retail price. Games that are multi-million sellers may become Greatest Hits titles much later than 9 months to maximize profits. It is also a common practice for a game to re-release on the Greatest Hits label at a close proximity to the release of that game's sequel or follow-up. In 2006, Sony extended the Greatest Hits program to the PlayStation Portable. To qualify, a title must be on the market for at least 9 months and have sold 250,000 copies or more. The Greatest Hits price for PlayStation Portable games typically begins at $19.99. On July 28, 2008, the program was introduced on the PlayStation 3. A PlayStation 3 game must be on the market for 10 months and sell at least 500,000 copies to meet the Greatest Hits criteria. PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits titles currently sell at $29.99. Sony announced the launch of Greatest Hits on PlayStation 4 in Mexico, Canada, and the United States, renamed PlayStation Hits, on June 19, 2018. As with PS3 Greatest Hits releases, they feature red-colored packaging and a red banner on their box art. PlayStation Hits pricing will also be available on PlayStation Store. \\"Special edition\\" Greatest Hits While Greatest Hits titles are usually just a re-release of the original game with altered packaging and a lower price, occasionally a game is given a \\"special edition\\" of its original version, released under the Greatest Hits label. Usually these additions are small bonuses, such as the inclusion of bugfixes, new game demos or soundtrack CDs, or slight improvements such as adding analog control or vibration functionality to games that did not have these features in their original releases. Occasionally, significant changes are implemented into the game.

Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the first Watcher to appear in the comics‚Äînamed Uatu‚Äîappears in Fantastic Four #13 (April 1963). The Watchers appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). Fictional history The Watchers are one of the oldest species in the universe and are committed to observing and compiling knowledge on all aspects of the universe. This policy of total non- interference came into existence due to a former, well-meant attempt by the Watchers to bestow advanced knowledge on the Prosilicans, who used the nuclear technology gained to create weapons and destroy themselves. When the Watchers returned to Prosilicus, the survivors blamed them for causing the catastrophe by giving the Prosilicans nuclear technology before they were ready for it. The Watchers then took a vow never to interfere with other civilizations.Tales of Suspense #52-53. Marvel Comics. Despite this, the Watcher Uatu has revealed himself to the superhero team the Fantastic Four, telling them of his race. In his first appearance, he made them battle the Red Ghost and his Super-Apes for control of the Moon. He complimented Reed Richards and claimed he would go to a more distant part of the galaxy to observe humanity.Fantastic Four #13 (April 1963). Marvel Comics. He aids them on several occasions against global threats such as the Molecule Man,Fantastic Four #20 (Nov. 1963). Marvel Comics. Galactus,Fantastic Four #48 (Mar. 1966). Marvel Comics. and the Overmind.Fantastic Four #113 (Aug. 1971). Marvel Comics. The Leader discovered his existence and tracked him to his world. He transported the Hulk there to get the Ultimate Machine, which contains all the information in the Universe. The Hulk battled the Amphibious Qnax, who had also been sent to recover the machine. The Watcher transported them away from his machines to battle, and when the Hulk won, he transported Qnax back to his homeworld. He then took the Hulk back to his base, where the Hulk took the Machine despite the Watcher's warnings. The Leader transported him back to Earth and tried to use the device. However, the tremendous amount of knowledge proved too much for the Leader. He collapsed to the ground, unmoving, and the Hulk assumed that he died of shock.Tales to Astonish #73-74. Marvel Comics. When the Hulk tried to use the machine himself, Uatu allowed him to hear the voice of Rick Jones, after which the Hulk removed the device. The Watcher then transported the Ultimate Machine back to his planet.Tales to Astonish #75. Marvel Comics. After blatant interference with the mission of the Kree soldier Mar-Vell, Uatu is put on trial by his own race, but is released on the provision that he never directly interfere again.Captain Marvel #37 - 38 (March‚ÄìMay (bi- monthly)1975). Marvel Comics. Uatu is later banished by his race for aiding the Fantastic Four against the threat of his rogue nephew, Aron, the Renegade Watcher, who tries to destroy the universe.Fantastic Four #400 (May 1995). Marvel Comics. The Dreaming Celestial later scans Uatu and learns the Watcher has broken his pact of non-interference almost 400 times.Eternals vol. 7, (Oct. 2008). Marvel Comics. The Celestial also reveals the Watchers, like the Celestials themselves, are servants of a concept called Fulcrum, with apparent consequences for interference. Despite this, the other Watchers have interfered in other civilizations' events, though rarely, notably when the world-ending robot Omegex approached the Milky Way and they deemed it dangerous enough to act directly against it. There is also a tongue-in-cheek, splintered-off faction of Watchers that call themselves The Critics, who not only observe events, but also give dramatic critique as they take place. The only known Critic looks similar to other Watchers, but wears a mustache, goatee, dark sunglasses, and, rather than toga, dresses in a tweed sport coat.Sensational She-Hulk #14-17. Marvel Comics. When Nova briefly visits Uatu and witnesses him watching various alternate realities, he learns that Uatu's father was the Watcher who originally gave nuclear technology to the Prosilicans, with Uatu's search of parallel universes being motivated by the desire to find the one world where his father's act of charity was proved to be the right thing to do.Original Sin #0. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Watchers are cosmic beings, who possess the innate ability to achieve virtually any effect desired, including augmenting personal attributes, time and space manipulation, molecular manipulation, energy projection, and a range of mental powers. They also have access to highly advanced technology. Known Watchers * Acba - A Watcher that was present during the universe's potential collapse.Quasar #25.

On the first page, he appears as a peeping-tom. =Earth X= In the alternate reality of Earth X (Earth-9997), the Watchers are slaves of the Celestials. As punishment for their non-interference during the birth of their arch-enemy Galactus, the Celestials force the Watchers to observe the impregnation of newly formed planets with their Celestial eggs, and the eventual birth of the Celestial within, which ultimately destroys that planet.Earth X:Issue X (Mar 2000). Marvel Comics. =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel alternate universe limited series Ultimate Origins, the Watchers are depicted as machines that speak through a human host (Sue Storm). They choose Rick Jones as their \\"herald\\" to help humans survive an \\"upcoming crisis\\".Ultimate Extinction #1 - 5 (Jan. 2006 - May 2006). Marvel Comics. In other media =Music= * The series was partially the inspiration for the Genesis song, \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\", from their 1972 Foxtrot album. =Television= * Uatu made two appearances in the 1967 Fantastic Four animated series, voiced by Paul Frees. * Uatu the Watcher appeared in the \\"Incredible Hulk\\" segment of the animated series The Marvel Super Heroes. * Uatu made a cameo appearance in the X-Men animated series. * Uatu made an appearance in the 1994 Fantastic Four animated series, voiced by Alan Oppenheimer. * The Watchers made appearances on the Silver Surfer animated series. * Uatu appears in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Tremble at the Might of...MODOK\\", voiced by Dave Boat.

Uatu just states, \\"Well, this I have got to see.\\" Around the end of the episode, Uatu looks into the window as Doctor Doom uses MODOK as a test subject in his Weapons Testing Chamber. He is later seen in \\"This Al Dente Earth\\" sitting in a recliner, eating popcorn, and taking pictures with his cell phone of the battle between the heroes and Galactus. * Uatu the Watcher will appear in the MCU Disney+ series What If...?, voiced by Jeffrey Wright. =Film= The Watchers appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 where their close-up appearances are portrayed by Walt Linscott. They are seen in both in the film and a post-credits scene. In these scenes, an informant of theirs (portrayed by Stan Lee) tells the uninterested group of Watchers about the experiences he has had on Earth when they meet with him on an asteroid.

The album is produced by Lovich and Les Chappell with additional production by Roger Bechirian and Alan Winstanley. It was recorded at the Wisseloord Studios in Hilversum, Netherlands. She worked with Chappell and Judge Smith on writing the songs. The cover sleeve depicts Lovich wearing a wedding dress and playing with hockey pucks on a string. It was taken inside a stainless steel fermentation tank at a Guinness brewery, after it had been emptied prior to cleaning. It caused controversy and few members of the Baptist church tried to get the album banned in the United States, saying it depicted an act of witchcraft. Lovich described Flex as her more introverted album. After its release, it received relatively positive reviews praising album's enhanced production compared to her previous album Stateless' rough sound. It was also more successful in charts, peaking at number 94 on the Billboard 200 and number 19 on the UK Albums Chart.\\"LENE LOVICH  Artist\\", Official Charts. The lead single \\"Bird Song\\" peaked at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. The following singles were \\"Angels\\" and \\"What Will I Do Without You?\\", of which the latter peaked at number 58. The release of the album was followed by Lovich's first sold-out tour in the United States and a three-month tour within Europe, the highlight of which was a sold-out show in front of 10,000 fans in Belgrade.\\"Lene Lovich - Press material\\", Epic, October 29, 1982. Background and recording After the release of her successful debut album Stateless (1978), Lovich embarked on the Be Stiff '78 tour along with four other artists from the recording label. In the middle of 1979, she had two top 20 hits, \\"Lucky Number\\" and \\"Say When\\", and was voted \\"Top Female Recording Artist of the Year\\" by Music Week. She went on to record her second more improved album and enhance the quality of productions by using modern technology and instruments to achieve a better sound than her previous record. She again collaborated with Les Chappell and also brought Judge Smith, who wrote two songs on the album. Flex was recorded at the Wisseloord Studios in Hilversum, Netherlands. Composition Described as Lovich's more introverted album, Flex deals with subjects that include more of emotional and mental activity, and are often inspired by dream images. The opening track \\"Bird Song\\" was written by Lovich and Les Chappell. When Lovich woke up in the night from a dream, she recorded different sounds on a tape recorder. The recording later served as an inspiration for the song, where at the beginning she mimics the sounds of birds. \\"What Will I Do Without You?\\" is a song written especially for the album by Judge Smith. Another song written by him appears on the album, \\"You Can't Kill Me\\", which he had already written in 1972. It deals with reincarnation. \\"Angels\\" is a song dedicated to people who like to live dangerously. Lovich spoke on people who do dangerous jobs and that they serve as an inspiration to other people. She also said, working in the music industry can be sometimes mentally damaging, but is also a good recreation. \\"The Night\\" is a cover of The Four Seasons' song. Lovich picked up the record in a second hand shop out of curiosity, since she had been interested in the band's music and later decided to record it for the album. In \\"Egghead\\", Lovich sings about people constantly learning a lot of facts, but not understanding life and practical things. In \\"Wonderful One\\", she expresses her feelings about music and how blessed she feels being able to create it. \\"Monkey Talk\\" was allegedly inspired by two books, one by Charles Darwin and Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle. It points out the transience of success. Using the image of Joan of Arc, \\"Joan\\" speaks about the necessity of self- confidence to trust your own ideas.

Career Formally trained in music composition, Dargel studied with Pauline Oliveros, John Luther Adams, and Brenda Hutchinson, and received a B.M. from Oberlin. According to Dargel, \\"The singer-songwriter approach to art song composition is a natural and refreshing alternative to the hegemony of traditional art song and operatic performance.\\" Dargel typically writes both words and music for all of his songs and, in his earlier compositions, he accompanies his own voice with a prepared electronic soundtrack. His debut album, Less Famous Than You, released in May 2006 on Use Your Teeth records, is clearly within the singer-songwriter tradition despite its incorporation of totalist rhythmic relationships. But his follow-up, Other People's Love Songs, released in 2008 on the contemporary classical label New Amsterdam Records, further blurs the lines between indie pop and the conceptual and post- minimalist conceits of downtown contemporary classical music. In May 2010, New Amsterdam released a follow-up, a 2-CD set entitled Someone Will Take Care of Me, which combines two song-cycles performed by Dargel with live musicians most usually associated with contemporary classical music performance: On Removable Parts, he is joined by pianist Kathleen Supov√©, and on Thirteen Near-Death Experiences he is joined by members of the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE) and composer/drummer David T. Little. The instrumentation for these two cycles clearly references the classical song cycle tradition; the former voice and piano combination is the original instrumentation for 19th century romantic song cycles (e.g. Franz Schubert's Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin, Robert Schumann's Dichterliebe, etc.), while the latter's small ensemble of flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano was introduced by Arnold Schoenberg for his 1912 song cycle Pierrot Lunaire and, with or without the addition of a percussionist, has become a ubiquitous ensemble for the performance of 20th and 21st century classical music and has been also used in countless vocal works including Peter Maxwell Davies's Eight Songs for a Mad King. Dargel has also performed and recorded music by other composers, including Oliveros, Eve Beglarian, k. terumi shorb, Phil Kline, and Nick Brooke.

He established new track records in three races and was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame. Manikato was the second Australian horse, after Kingston Town, to win $1 million in stakes, and, by today's standards, won 20 races which are currently (2012) classed as Group One (G1) races. He was a tall, heavily topped chestnut gelding by the VRC Newmarket Handicap winner Manihi from Markato by Natural Bid (USA).Manikato Retrieved on 28 April 2009 Markato was the dam of eight named foals, but Manikato was her only stakes-winner. Costing only A$3,500, Manikato had a double cross of Fair Trial in the fourth generation (4m x 4f) and was a descendant of Nearco through his dam. Racing career He was originally trained by Bon Hoysted who died soon after Manikato's 1978 Golden Slipper victory. His brother Bob Hoysted took over his training subsequently. =At two years= As a two-year-old, Manikato won the Blue Diamond Stakes and Golden Slipper Stakes double. =At three years= Manikato won eight races and was second three times out of twelve starts. He finished second three times, including one to champion stayer, Dulcify, in the Australian Cup over 2,000 metres. Manikato commenced the season with a win in the Ascot Vale Stakes in record time. Three weeks later he started against older horses in the Marlboro Cup which he also won. In the Caulfield Guineas Manikato defeated Karaman by about two lengths after a protest against him was dismissed, but his jockey Gary Willetts was suspended. He then started in the Craven A Stakes (now known as the Salinger Stakes) but had a slight rise in temperature on the day of the race. Manikato was defeated in this race by Always Welcome by the margin of a neck. After being spelled Manikato won the first of his five victories in the William Reid Stakes on 29 January 1979. The C F Orr Stakes at Sandown was Manikato‚Äôs next start and another victory. His win the Futurity Stakes was the first of four wins that he had in this race. In 1978 the race was run over 1800 metres and in his first attempt at a distance beyond a mile, Manikato won untouched and easing up by 4 lengths in a course record time. IAt his next start in the Australian Cup over 2000 metres he was taken on in front by three horses during the running and was only caught in the shadows of the post by Dulcify who was unbeaten at Flemington until his tragic injury in the 1979 Melbourne Cup, Manikato next started in the George Ryder Stakes where he dropped back 500 metres in distance and won by six lengths, again in record time with Joyita finishing second. A week later Manikato started as a 3yo in the Doncaster Handicap carrying 57.5 kg. This was 3.5 kg over the weight carrying record for a three-year-old in the Doncaster held by Tontonan, himself a great champion of the Australian turf. Manikato was again challenged for the lead throughout the race and dead heated for third place. A new Australian record was set for the 1,600 metres race. In early July 1979 Manikato was taken to Brisbane for the Rothmans 100,000 (now known by its original name of the Doomben 10,000). Carrying a 3yo weight record of 58 kg he equalled Baguette‚Äôs weight carrying record and became the first 3yo to win over $500,000 in prize money. =At four years= Five weeks later Manikato started his 4yo season with the first of two wins in the Freeway Stakes. On 24 September 1981 he finished second in the Marlboro Cup over 1,400 metres after he struck himself and was galloped on during the running of the race. He won William Reid Stakes and Futurity Stakes. In Sydney Manikato won the G1 George Ryder Stakes. Two weeks later he started in the AJC Galaxy Stakes with 60.5 kg and finished in 8th position. After the race he was found to have suffered a bleeding attack. =At five years= In 1981 Manikato won the William Reid Stakes, Futurity Stakes and Orr Stakes again. In the autumn Manikato had to overcome serious adversity again when he damaged his suspensory tendons. After every race, Bon wrapped the horse's legs with plastic shopping bags filled with ice, to reduce inflammation. After a spell Manikato resumed racing at Sandown with a win on 1 September 1981 in a handicap in carrying 63.5 kg. Two weeks later he lined up in the Marlboro Cup with 60.5 kg finishing second to Soldier of Fortune to whom he conceded 8 kg. On 29 September 1981 Manikato started in the Queen Elizabeth Cup run in honour of the Queen‚Äôs attendance at the Caulfield meeting. Manikato won from Lawman with Sovereign Red in third place and equalled the course record of 1:35.7. His next start was in the Chirnside Stakes where he finished second. After a spell Manikato returned to again win the William Reid Stakes. Four weeks later on 24 February 1982 Manikato contested his fourth consecutive Futurity Stakes but finished second this time. In the Canterbury Stakes at Sydney two weeks later Manikato defeated Opera Prince and Ubetido. He then finished third in the All Aged Stakes before being spelled for 18 weeks. =At six years= During 1982/3 season Manikato had 11 starts for five wins including the Freeway Stakes, Futurity Stakes, A J Moir Stakes, William Reid Stakes and Memsie Stakes. He had 47 starts for 29 wins, 9 seconds and 4 thirds, including five successive William Reid Stakes and four Futurity Stakes winning 11 Group 1 races in all for $1,154,210. After retiring After retiring from racing in 1983, Manikato was plagued by a virus which he could not shake off. He was humanely euthanized on 13 February 1984. He is buried within sight of some of his greatest wins in \\"Manikato's Garden\\" at Moonee Valley Racecourse. The Group 1 Manikato Stakes, named in his honour is contested annually at the Moonee Valley Racecourse. The Manikato Restaurant in the grandstand at Caulfield Racecourse is also named in his honour. He was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame in 2002.

It was directed by William Hanna, Joseph Barbera and Rudolf Ising, and produced by Rudolf Ising and Fred Quimby. It was based on the Aesop's Fable, The Cat and the Mice. As was the practice of MGM shorts at the time, only Rudolf Ising is credited. It was released to theaters on February 10, 1940 by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. In this first short, the cat is named Jasper, and appears to be a mangy, battle-hardened street cat, more malicious than the character that Tom would develop into over time. The unnamed mouse was similar to the ultimate Jerry character, just a bit skinnier. The basic premise was the one that would become familiar to audiences; in The Art of Hanna-Barbera, Ted Sennett sums it up as \\"cat stalks and chases mouse in a frenzy of mayhem and slapstick violence. The studio heads were unimpressed, but audiences loved the film, and it was nominated for an Academy Award. Synopsis A cat named Jasper takes great pleasure in tormenting a mouse named Jinx (not referred to in name on- screen), who is trying to run away from Jasper while he keeps grabbing Jinx's tail to keep him from running anywhere. Eventually, Jinx breaks free but goes into Jasper's mouth, narrowly escaping. Jasper then draws a mouse hole on the wall to trick Jinx into entering it. Jinx bangs against the wall so hard that it knocks him silly. Jasper revives him using water from the fish tank and picks him up. Having slowly realized the situation, Jinx punches Jasper in the eye, causing him to yelp and screeched in pain. The angered cat chases Jinx and accidentally bumps into a Greek pillar, where it breaks upon falling onto him along with the flowerpot that was standing on it. Mammy Two Shoes enters the room and scolds Jasper for his unacceptable behavior, issuing him an ultimatum that if she catches him making one more mess, he will get kicked out of the house. Jasper sulks off, Jinx chuckles at him and this causes Jasper to chase him, but when Jinx holds a glass over the edge of the table, Jasper backs off after seeing a furious Mammy walking away with the remains of the broken flowerpot, fearing that he will get himself into trouble again. After Jinx puts the cup down, seeing his chance, Jasper rushes at him, but he holds back Jasper by threatening to drop the glass again. Then Jinx drops the cup and Jasper rushes to catch it. Jinx throws more cups, making it very hard for Jasper to catch them all. As Jinx walks away with the last cup, feeling pretty smug that he has the advantage, Jasper gets the idea: he drops a bunch of pillows on the ground. When Jinx tries to humiliate Jasper by dropping the cup, it stays intact when it lands on the soft surface of one of the pillows. Jinx tries to escape but Jasper catches him by the tail. Jasper inadvertently throws Jinx onto a shelf, where he escapes and begins pelting him with several dishes, making sure that in order to blackmail Jasper, he will force him to immediately \\"get the boot\\". Jasper begins to feel tired of holding all the dishes, after which, in humiliation, Jasper can only watch as Jinx drops one last dish on the ground, breaking it, and thus alerting Mammy to thinking Jasper violated her ultimatum. Mammy once again enters the room in frustration just as Jinx swims in Jasper's milk bowl, uses his tail as a towel and finally kicks Jasper, causing Jasper to drop all of the dishes, creating a huge mess and forcing him to take the blame. Enraged, Mammy hits and throws Jasper out of the house and shuts the door. As soon as Jasper is kicked out from the house, Jinx waves to him, sticks his tongue out, puts a HOME SWEET HOME sign in front of his hole, and enters it. Production and release In June 1937, animator and storyman Joseph Barbera began to work for the Ising animation unit at MGM, then the largest studio in Hollywood. He learned that co-owner Louis B. Mayer wished to boost the animation department by encouraging the artists to develop some new cartoon characters, following the lack of success with its earlier cartoon series based on the Captain and the Kids comic strip. Barbera then teamed with fellow Ising unit animator and director William Hanna and pitched new ideas, among them was the concept of two \\"equal characters who were always in conflict with each other\\". An early thought involved a fox and a dog before they settled on a cat and mouse. The pair discussed their ideas with producer Fred Quimby, then the head of the short film department who, despite a lack of interest in it, gave them the green-light to produce one cartoon short. The short, Puss Gets the Boot, featured a cat named Jasper and an unnamed mouse, named Jinx in pre-production, and an African American housemaid named Mammy Two Shoes. Leonard Maltin described it as \\"very new and special [...] that was to change the course of MGM cartoon production\\" and established the successful Tom and Jerry formula of comical cat and mouse chases with slapstick gags. It was released onto the theatre circuit on February 10, 1940, and the pair, having been advised by management not to produce any more, focused on other cartoons including Gallopin' Gals (1940) and Officer Pooch (1941). Matters changed, however, when Texas businesswoman Bessa Short sent a letter to MGM asking whether more cat and mouse shorts would be produced, which helped convince management to commission a series. A studio contest held to rename both characters was won by animator John Carr, who suggested Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse after the Christmastime drink. Carr was awarded a first place prize of $50. Puss Gets the Boot was a critical success, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject: Cartoons in 1941 despite the credits listing Ising and omitting Hanna and Barbera. After MGM gave the green-light for Hanna and Barbera to continue, the studio entered production on The Midnight Snack (1941). The pair would continue to work on Tom and Jerry cartoons for the next fifteen years of their career. Reception Motion Picture Exhibitor reviewed the short on March 6, 1940: \\"Puss teases the mouse but when the latter learns that breakage in the house will lead to Puss being thrown out, the fun begins. Windup has the crockery crashing, the mouse victorious, Puss getting the boot.\\" Voice cast *Harry E.

After a careful education abroad, concluding with one year under Cesare Cremonini at Padua, he returned to Denmark in 1629 and quickly won the favor of King Christian IV. In 1634 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Elephant, in 1636 became Councillor of State, in 1637 Governor of Copenhagen, and in 1643 Steward of the Realm. He is commonly known and recognized as the most notorious traitor in Danish history. Rise to power Painting by Karel van Mander; Frederiksborg Museum In 1637 Ulfeldt married Leonora Christina (1621‚Äì1698) who was the daughter of King Christian IV of Denmark. She had been betrothed to him from her ninth year. Ulfeldt was the most striking personality at the Danish court in all superficial accomplishments, but his character was marked by ambition, avarice and absolute lack of honor or conscience. He was largely responsible for the disasters of the Swedish war of 1643-45, and when the Treaty of Br√∂msebro was signed there was a violent scene between him and the King, though Ulfeldt's resignation was not accepted. In December 1646 he was sent as ambassador extraordinary to the Hague, but the results of his embassy by no means corresponded to its costliness, and when he returned to Denmark in July 1647 he found the king profoundly irritated. Ulfeldt, supported by the Rigsr√•d and the nobility, who objected to Christian's fiscal policy, resisted his father-in-law, and triumphed completely. As Steward of the Realm he was the virtual ruler of Denmark during the two months which elapsed between the death of Christian IV and the election of Frederick III (6 July 1648); but the new king was by no means disposed to tolerate the outrageous usurpations of Ulfeldt and his wife, and this antagonism was still further complicated by allegations of a plot (ultimately proved to be false, but believed at the time to be true) on the part of Dina Vinhofvers, a former mistress of Ulfeldt, to poison the royal family. Dina was convicted of perjury and executed, but Ulfeldt no longer felt secure at Copenhagen, and on the day after the execution he secretly left Denmark (14 July 1651) with his family. Treason After living for a time in concealment at Amsterdam, Ulfeldt moved to Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania. In 1657, King Charles X of Sweden invaded Denmark. In July 1657, Ulfeldt responded to the King's invitation to enter his service. Sweden was Denmark's deadliest foe. Ulfeldt's purpose was twofold: humiliate his monarch and secure a personal fortune. He persuaded the commandant of Nakskov (a strategically crucial fortress) to surrender to Charles X, and did his best to convince his countrymen that resistance was useless. He even loaned the Swedish king a fortune to finance the war with money that, it is believed, was embezzled from the Danish state. Finally, as one of the Swedish negotiators at the Treaty of Taastrup, he was instrumental in assuring the humiliation of his native land. Ulfeldt's treason was rewarded by Charles X of Sweden with ennoblement as the Count of S√∂lvesborg in Blekinge; however a discontented Ulfeldt instead began intriguing against his new master. He was soon discovered, and in May 1659 was sentenced to death. On 7 July the Swedish regents amnestied him, and he returned to Copenhagen to try to make his peace with his lawful sovereign, who promptly imprisoned him and his wife. In the summer of 1660 they were conveyed to Hammershus in Bornholm, as prisoners of state. Later life Corfitz Ulfeldt's pillory, now in the National Museum of Denmark Their captivity was severe to brutal and they were released in September 1661 in the most degrading conditions. The fallen magnate henceforth dreamed of nothing but revenge, and in the course of 1662, during his residence at Bruges, he offered the Danish crown to the Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, proposing to raise a rebellion in Denmark for that purpose. Frederick William betrayed Ulfeldt's treason to Frederick III, and the Danish government at once impeached the traitor; on 24 July 1663 he and his children were degraded, his property was confiscated, and he was condemned to be beheaded and quartered. He escaped from the country, but the sentence was actually carried out on his effigy; and a pillory was erected on the ruins of his mansion at Copenhagen. During a new flight he died February 1664 in a boat on the Rhine not far from Basel. The circumstances of his death or his final resting place are not known. Legacy To posterity Corfits Ulfeldt has stood as the prototype of a traitor in Danish history. In addition, modern historians have been liable to view him as a highly mentally unstable man whose lust for power ended in megalomania and insanity. In contrast his wife Leonora Christina has been admired because of her long time as a prisoner after his death. She spent twenty-one years in confinement in the royal dungeon, Bl√•t√•rn, prior to her release during 1685. Jammers Minde is an autobiography completed in 1674 by Leonora Christina. It was first published in 1869 and translated into English as Memoirs of Leonora Christina.

The short (produced and directed by Rudolf Ising and co-produced by Fred Quimby with the voice of Bernice Hansen as the kittens and their mother, and musical supervision by Scott Bradley) explores the adventures of the \\"three little kittens who lost their mittens\\", as they explore a dreamland where space is made up entirely of dairy products (for example, the Milky Way is made of milk and the Moon is made of green cheese). The short won the 1940 Oscar for Best Animated Short Film, and was the first non-Disney film to do so. Other shorts nominated in 1940 included A Wild Hare by Warner Bros., introducing Bugs Bunny, and another MGM cartoon Puss Gets the Boot, with Jasper & Jinx, the prototype for Tom and Jerry. It was added as a bonus feature in the Marx Bros. DVD release of Go West (1940). Plot Three kittens, denied milk as punishment for losing their mittens after playing out in the snow, sail up into the Milky Way in a basket lifted by three helium balloons. Once in the Milky Way, they find it a land of natural milk springs and gushers. The kittens proceed to happily gorge themselves on milk, until they end up getting into trouble and risk falling back down to Earth. However, it turns out to be just in their imagination, and their mother comes in to their bedroom to invite them for supper. They rush down excitedly only to be shocked to see that it's milk.

History The section between the M6 and Junction 35A was originally opened in 1960,The Motorway Archive ‚Äì Dates Page as part of the Lancaster Bypass.Route 6 ‚Äì Junction 35 This was a 2 lane motorway. In 1970, the M6 was extended north, and a short spur was left to the A6. The terminal roundabout was given the junction number 35A. Plans existed to extend this as part of an Arnside link road, which would have connected the Furness Peninsula with the M6, but they were scrapped for environmental reasons, but parts of this road exist today, along the A590. In 1987, a link was constructed with the B6254, to remove traffic for Over Kellet Quarries and Kirkby Lonsdale passing through Carnforth. The road was then renumbered as the A601(M). No junction number was given to this terminus. In early 2020 the link road was downgraded to a B road.CBRD Motorway Database ‚Äì A601(M) Junctions { border=1 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: black; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"0080d0\\" style=\\"color: white;font-size:120%;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  A601(M) motorway - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"000000\\" style=\\"color: white\\"  Southbound exits  Junction  Northbound exits - align=\\"center\\"  Carnforth, Over Kellet, Kirkby Lonsdale B6254  Terminus  Start of motorway - align=\\"center\\"  Lake District, Carlisle, Kendal, Barrow-in-Furness, Lancaster, Preston, THE SOUTH M6  J35  Lake District, Carlisle, Barrow-in- Furness, Lancaster, Preston, THE SOUTH M6 - align=\\"center\\"  Start of motorway  J35a Terminus  Milnthorpe, Kendal, Morecambe, Carnforth A6 } See also *List of motorways in the United Kingdom *Great Britain road numbering scheme References External links *Pathetic Motorways ‚Äì A601(M) Category:Motorways in England Category:Roads in Lancashire Category:Two-lane motorways ","title":"A601(M) motorway"},{"id":"2137371","text":"The Canadian province of Alberta has 379 school authorities, which are sometimes referred to as school boards, school districts, or school divisions.

HMGN1 and HMGN2 (initially designated HMG-14 and HMG-17 respectively) were discovered by E.W. Johns research group in the early 1970s. HMGN3, HMGN4, and HMGN5 were discovered later and are less abundant. HMGNs are nucleosome binding proteins that help in transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair. They can also alter the chromatin epigenetic landscape, helping to stabilize cell identity. There is still relatively little known about their structure and function. HMGN proteins are found in all vertebrates, and play a role in chromatin structure and histone modification. HMGNs come in long chains of amino acids, containing around 100 for HMGN1-4, and roughly 200 in HMGN5. Recent research on the HMGN family is focused on their effect on cell identity, and how reduction of HMGNs relates to induced reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).  Function  Much of the research that has been done HMGN proteins have been done in vitro, while there is relatively little on the in vivo function and roles of HMGN proteins. Due to these proteins being predominantly found in higher eukaryotes, the use of microorganisms and other lower eukaryotes has deemed insufficient to determine the in vivo roles of HMGN proteins. A study was done with knockout mice to see the effect if any that HMGN proteins play on a full organism level. This resulted in the mice showing increasing sensitivity to UV radiation when having less than normal levels of HMGN(2). This would indicate that HMGN might facilitate repair of UV damage. The same increase in sensitivity was observed in mice when exposed to gamma radiation, however the cellular processes that repair DNA in either case are drastically different, leading to an inconclusive state whether HMGN proteins facilitate DNA repair in vivo. HMGN1 and HMGN2 do not co-localize within living cells. This is indication of possible different roles of each HMGN.  Family  HMGN Family of proteins. AAs are amino acids in length. Inspired by a figure from Developmental function of HMGN Proteins by Takashi Furusawa and Srujana Cherukuri HMGN proteins are part of broader group of proteins referred to as High Mobility group chromosomal (HMG) proteins. This larger group was named this for their high electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels and is differentiated into 3 distinct but related groups, one of them being HMGN proteins. HMGN family can be further divided into specific proteins, these being HMGN1, HMGN2, HMGN3, HMGN4, and HMGN5. The overall sizes of the proteins vary to each specific one, but HMGN1-4 average 100 amino acids. Whereas the larger HMGN5 proteins are 300+ amino acids long in mice and roughly 200 in length for humans. = HMGN 1 and HMGN 2 = HMGN1 and HMGN2 are among the most common of the HMGN proteins. The main purpose and function are reducing the compaction of the cellular chromatin by nucleosome binding. NMR evidence shows that reducing compaction occurs when the proteins targets the main elements that are responsible for the compactions of the chromatin. These have an expression rates that correlate to the differentiation of the cells it is present in. Areas that have experienced differentiation have reduced expression levels in comparison to undifferentiated areas, where HMGN1 and HMGN2 are highly expressed. = HMGN 3 = HMGN3 has two variants, HMGN3a and HMGN3b. Unlike the HMGN1 and HMGN2 proteins, both forms of HMGN3 tend to be tissue and development specific. They are only expressed in certain tissues at specific developmental stages. There is no preference to a certain tissue given by the two variants of the HMGN3 proteins. There is equal likelihood that either be present in a certain highly expressed HMGN3 tissue. The brain and the eyes in particular are areas that HMGN3 is heavily expressed as well as in adult pancreatic islet cells. It has been shown that the loss of HMGN3 in mice has led to a mild onset of diabetes due to ineffective insulin secretion. = HMGN 4 = The discovery of HMGN4 was done by GenBank during a database search and identified it as a \\"new HMGN2 like transcript\\", indicating that HMGN4 is closely related to HMGN2. There has been very little research done on HMGN4 proteins. The gene associated with the production of the HMGN4 is located in a region associated with schizophrenia on chromosome 6. Until this point every kind of HMGN has been identified in the vertebrates, but HMGN4 has only been seen and identified in primates. Within humans, HMGN4 has shown high levels of expression in the thyroid, thymus and the lymph nodes. = HMGN 5 = The most recent addition to the HMGN protein family is of HMGN5. It is larger than the previous HMGNs, containing 300+ amino acids, due to a long C-terminal domain that varies with species, explaining why mice and humans have a different size of HMGN5. Its biological function is unknown but has shown expression in placental development. There have also been cases where HMGN5 was present in human tumors including, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, etc. For this reason, it is thought that HMGN5 might have some link to cancer and might be a potential target for cancer therapy in the future.  Binding of HMGN proteins to chromatin  Chromatin organization By Sha, K. and Boyer, L. A., stemBook 2009 The location of HMGN during mitosis is the subject of several studies. It is very difficult to date their intra-nuclear organization during the various stages of cell cycle. There is a superfamily of abundance and ubiquitous nuclear proteins that bind to chromatin without any known DNA sequence, which is composed of HMGA, HMBG, and HMGN families. HMGA is associated with chromatin throughout the cell cycle, located in the scaffold of the metaphase chromosome. Both HMGB and HMGN are associated with the mitotic chromosome. The interactions of all HMGs with chromatin is highly dynamic, proteins move constantly throughout the nucleus. The sample nucleosomes for potential binding sites in a \\"stop and go\\" manner, with the \\"stop\\" step being longer than the \\"go\\" step. Through the use of immunofluorescence studies, live cell imaging, gel mobility shift assays, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, the above was determined and also by comparing the chromatin binding properties of wild-type and HMGN mutant proteins. In conclusion, HMGNs can associate with mitotic chromatin. However, the binding of HMGN to mitotic chromatin is not dependent on a functional HMGN nucleosomal binding domain, and weaker than the binding to interphase nucleosomes in which HMGNs form specific complexes with nucleosomes.  H1 competition and chromatin remodeling  Diagram of nucleosome with bound histone H1 Nucleosomes serve as the protein core (made from 8 histones) for DNA to wrap around, functioning as a foundation for the larger and more condensed chromatin structures of chromosomes. HMGN proteins compete with Histone H1 (linker histone not part of the core nucleosome) for nucleosome binding sites. Once occupied one protein cannot displace the other. However both proteins are not permanently associated to the nucleosomes and can be removed via post transcriptional modifications. In the case of HMGN proteins, Protein kinase C (PKC) can phosphorylate the serine amino acids in the nucleosome binding domain present in all HMGN variants. This gives HMGNs a mobile character as they are continuously able to bind and unbind to nucleosomes depending on the intracellular environment and signaling. Active competition between HMGNs and H1 serve an active role in chromatin remodeling and as result play a role in the cell cycle and cellular differentiation where chromatin compaction and de-compaction determine if certain genes are expressed or not. Histone acetylation is usually associated with open chromatin, and histone methylation is usually associated with closed chromatin. With use of ChIP-sequencing it is possible to study DNA paired with proteins to determine what kind of histone modifications are present when the nucleosomes are bound to either H1 or HMGNs. Using this method it was found that H1 presence corresponded to high levels of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, which means that the H3 histone is heavily methylated suggesting that the chromatin structure is closed. It was also found that HMGN presence corresponded to high levels of H3K27ac and H3K4me1, conversely meaning that the H3 histone methylation is greatly reduced suggesting the chromatin structure is open.  Transcriptional activity and cellular differentiation  = Functional compensation = While the role of HMGNs are still being researched, it is clear that the absence of HMGNs in knock out (KO) and knock down (KD) studies result in a significant difference of a cell's total transcriptional activity. Several transcriptome studies have been conducted which show various other genes are either unregulated or down regulated due to HMGN absence. Interestingly in the case of HMGN1&2 only knocking out HMGN1 or HMGN2 results in changes for just few genes. But when you knock out both HMGN1&2 there is far more pronounced effect with regard to changes in gene activity. For example, in mice brain when only HMGN1 was knocked out only 1 gene was up- regulated, when only HMGN2 was knocked out 19 genes were up-regulated and 29 down-regulated. But when both HMGN1&2 are knocked out 50 genes were up- regulated and 41 down-regulated. If you simply tallied the totals for the HMGN1 and HMGN2 knock outs you would not get the same results as an HMGN1&2 DKO (double knock out). This is described as functional compensation since both HMGN1 and HMGN2 are only slightly different in terms of protein structure and essentially do the same thing. They have largely the same affinity for nucleosomal binding sites. That means a lot of times if HMGN1 is absent, HMGN2 can fill in and vis versa. Using ChIP-seq it was found in mice chromosomes there were 16.5K sites were both HMGN1&2 could bind, 14.6K sites that had HMGN1 preference and only 6.4K sites that had HMGN2 preference. Differences in HMGN1 and HMGN2 activity are pronounced in the brain, thymus, liver, and spleen suggesting HMGN variants also have specialized roles in addition to their overlapping functionality. = Eye development = This overlapping functionality may seem redundant or even deleterious, however these proteins are integral to various cellular processes, especially differentiation and embryogenesis as it provides a means for dynamic chromatin modeling. For example, in mice embryo, during ocular development HMGN1,2&3. HMGN1 expression is elevated during initial stages of eye development in progenitor cells, but is decreased in newly formed and fated cells, such as lens fiber cells. HMGN2 in contrast stays elevated in both embryonic and adult eye cells. HMGN3 was found to be especially elevated at 2 weeks (for an adult mouse) in the inner nuclear and ganglion cells. This shows there is an uneven distribution of HMGNs in pre-fated and adult cells. = Brain / CNS development = Oligodendrocyte differntiation is HMGN reliant In human brain development HMGNs have been shown to be a critical component of neural differentiation and are elevated in neural stem cells (neural progenitor cells). For example, in a knock down study, loss of HMGN1,2&3 resulted in lower population of astrocyte cells and higher population of neural progenitor cells. In oligodendrocyte differentiation HMGNs are critical, since when HMGN1&2 are both knocked out the population of oligodendrocytes in spinal tissue was reduced 65%. However, due to functional compensation this effect is not observed when only HMGN1 or HMGN2 are knocked. This observation if not just correlation. With ChIP-seq analysis it is shown that chromatin modeling at the OLIG1&2 genes (transcription factors involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation) is in an open conformation and has HMGNs bound to the nucleosomes. It can be inferred that this redundancy is actually beneficial as the presence of at least one HMGN variant vastly improves tissue differentiation and development. These findings are summarized in the figure to the right.

Career =Harlem Knights= The team that would later be known as ‚ÄúMen on a Mission‚Äù started out by competing as a team in the Pro Wrestling Federation and the United States Wrestling Association where they wrestled as The Harlem Knights with Frazier being known as Nelson Knight and Horne as Bobby Knight, with the two being billed as brothers. In the PWF the team was managed by George South. The duo would return to the PWF in 1996 and won the PWF Tag Team Title. While in the USWA the team feuded with Jerry Lawler, Jeff Jarrett and other faces being pushed as the ‚ÄúMonster threat‚Äù due to their size. Their work in the PWF and the USWA got them noticed by the WWF and they were signed to a contract in 1993. =Men on a Mission= When Men on a MissionMen on a Mission: Rappin' fool trio that made life a living hell for anyone who had ears within a ten mile radius of WWF events. began appearing on WWF television on June 14, 1993, their vicious heel gimmick had been repackaged as faces. They wore bright clothes, had positive attitudes, and teamed with a rapping manager called ‚ÄúOscar‚Äù and they were now known as ‚ÄúMabel‚Äù, ‚ÄúOscar‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMo‚Äù, collectively ‚ÄúM.O.M.‚Äù or ‚ÄúMen On a Mission‚Äù. They had the image of three people who could be loved by the crowd but who were also attempting to make positive changes in their neighborhood. This was accomplished through use of several vignettes showing them walking down streets in the ghetto but saying positive things and talking about how things could be made better. WWF Tag Team Championship. The team met with moderate success and got over with the crowd because of Mabel's unusual size, their in-ring personas, and Oscar's crowd pleasing raps. Their fun loving personalities were prominently displayed at the 1993 Survivor Series, when they, along with The Bushwhackers, dressed up as Doink the Clown and wrestled as \\"The Four Doinks\\" in a comedy match against Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger, and The Headshrinkers. The team even won the match in comedic fashion, with all four team members garnering the pin on Bigelow. Their next feud was against the WWF Tag Team Champions The Quebecers. Men on a Mission won the titles on March 29, 1994 at a house show in London, England. This happened when the large Mabel fell on Pierre and stunned him. When the ref went to make his count, Pierre did not kick out as was scripted. Two days later, to fix the error, the Quebecers regained the titles in Sheffield, England. The title change was also reported on WWF television. Men on a Mission were temporarily sidelined when Mo injured his leg in a singles match against Owen Hart on the May 1 episode of Wrestling Challenge (taped April 12 in Syracuse, NY). Mo would not return to competition until October;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm meanwhile Mabel, who was seen as the big star of the group, began wrestling more singles matches in an attempt to get over as a solo wrestler. He was also used to help get rising stars over, due to his size. Men on a Mission returned to regular teaming in late 1994, and moved almost immediately back into the Tag Team Championship picture. The team was entered in an eight-team tournament for the WWF Tag Team Championship, which was vacant at the time due to champions Shawn Michaels and Diesel breaking up. The team was eliminated in the first round on December 17, 1994 by Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow (who went on to lose in the tournament final to Bob \\"Spark Plugg\\" Holly and The 1-2-3 Kid). After that they continued to climb the ranks in the tag division, culminating in a match against the then champion Smoking Gunns on an episode of Action Zone which aired in March 1995. The Gunns defeated Mabel and Mo, who responded by attacking them postmatch as a precursor to a villainous turn. The next week on Action Zone Oscar offered an apology to The Gunns, and on the show after that Mabel and Mo decided to bring out the Gunns to shake their hands. After shaking their hands and raising the arms of the Gunns, Mabel and Mo then responded by clotheslining Billy and Bart Gunn to the mat. As Mabel repeatedly splashed Bart while Mo assaulted Billy, Oscar tried to intervene and pleaded with his charges to stop. Mo shoved Oscar to the mat and held him there while Mabel nailed him with a running leg drop, completing the heel turn as Mabel and Mo mocked the Gunns by parading around the ring wearing their cowboy hats and antagonized the fans. With the turn, Mabel and Mo dropped the rapping and \\"trying to make a difference\\" characters and reverted to the ruthless thug characters they portrayed before joining the WWF. Originally, Oscar was to remain as the team's manager, but he objected to the idea of the heel turn and decided to leave the company. In an interview for Pro Wrestling Insider, Oscar explained that the reason why he signed on to be part of Men on a Mission was that he was a positive person and believed in the nature of the characters, and turning them into thugs was something he did not want to be part of. He retired from wrestling after the turn.http://pwinsider.com/article/41503/oscar-reveals-why-he-was-kicked-out- of-men-on-a-mission-why-pn-news-failed-details-on-the-mom-reunion-and-more-in- his-first-ever-shoot-interview.html?p=1 =King Mabel and Sir Mo= After a short feud with the Smokin‚Äô Gunns, Mabel returned to singles competition and was immediately given the spot as the top villain in the company. He won the 1995 King of the Ring and began referring to himself as King Mabel, with Mo becoming Sir Mo and taking on more of a managerial role. Mabel was put into a feud with Diesel, the reigning WWF Champion, with the two scheduled to wrestle at Summerslam. However, the WWF's plans changed on the August 14, 1995 broadcast of Monday Night Raw. That night, Men on a Mission were to face the Allied Powers in the main event. However, Lex Luger did not show and The British Bulldog asked Diesel to team with him. Bulldog then turned heel by attacking Diesel and assisting Men on a Mission in beating him down. The entire situation was referred to on air as the \\"Royal Plan\\" and was to involve Jim Cornette, who took the Bulldog as a client following the match. However, the feud between Mabel and Diesel was cut off following SummerSlam after Mabel injured the champion by performing a seated senton onto his lower back. With the Bulldog now taking over Mabel's top villain spot, Mabel was placed in a feud with The Undertaker.http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/big- daddy-v.html The feud ended just as quickly and once again, it was due to Mabel injuring his opponent as he broke several bones in Undertaker's face with a leg drop. In January 1996 they left the WWF after Royal Rumble 1996. =Post WWF= Shortly after leaving the WWF, Frazier and Horne (still wrestling as Mabel and Mo) moved to the United States Wrestling Association. They feuded with The Moondogs and Doug Gilbert and Brian Christopher. Then they were both entered in a tournament for the Unified Heavyweight Championship. Mabel defeated Mo on March 4, 1996 and went on to lose in the tournament final to Jerry Lawler. The team broke up in June 1996. They met each other once again on January 4, 1997 when Mabel won a Lumberjack match in USWA. Frazier eventually returned to the WWF as Mabel in 1998 doing a run in on 1998 King Of The Ring Ken Shamrock and getting beaten by Shamrock later that night. Frazier made an appearance in ECW as a part of The Full Blooded Italians after a match between Tracy Smothers and Tommy Rogers until Spike Dudley took him down with an acid drop. Frazier made his return at the 1999 Royal Rumble, taking on Mankind and later that night jumped one of The Headbangers to enter the Royal Rumble match. Undertaker and his Ministry of Darkness pulled him out of the match and threw him in the back of a hearse. This led to him being repackaged as Viscera, a member of the Ministry of Darkness. Frazier was released from his WWF contract in August 2000. In March 2003, Frazier, as \\"Nelson Knight\\", made a surprise appearance at a weekly NWA: Total Nonstop Action pay-per-view at the side of Ron Killings. A second appearance followed the next week, but Frazier soon returned to the independent circuit. On September 21, 2004, Frazier returned again to the WWE as Viscera. In 2007, he was repackaged as \\"Big Daddy V\\" and began appearing on the ECW brand. Frazier was released from his WWE contract on August 8, 2008. After wrestling for promotions such as the National Wrestling Alliance and the Insane Clown Posse's Juggalo Championship Wrestling, Frazier began wrestling for All Japan Pro Wrestling, as Big Daddy Voodoo, where he is a former All Asia Tag Team Champion with TARU and is part of the Voodoo Murders stable Horne stayed in the independent promotions and wrestled as both Mo and Rob Harlem. He and Frazier both resurfaced in Memphis Wrestling for a show in 2003, during which Horne (as Mo) turned on Frazier (as Mabel), which led to a one-off match which Frazier won. Horne retired from wrestling on March 1, 2006, and Frazier died of a heart attack on February 18, 2014.

History Born in Montreal, Quebec, Jacques H√©bert began attending Saint Dunstan's University in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island at age 16. He served as a journalist for the newspaper Le Devoir from 1951 to 1953 and created the publishing companies √âditions de l'Homme in 1958 and √âditions du Jour in 1961. He was a reporter during the Wilbert Coffin trial in 1954 and he later published two books on the subject: Coffin √©tait innocent (1958) and J'accuse les assassins de Coffin (1963). The latter book caused such controversy that the provincial government established a Commission of Inquiry into the case. H√©bert was a close friend of Pierre Trudeau and traveled with him to the People's Republic of China in 1960 in the midst of the Great Leap Forward. The two met both Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and recorded their observations in the book Deux innocents en Chine rouge (1961). The book was published in English as Two Innocents in Red China in 1968. A Chinese-language version was published in China in 2005 - H√©bert attended the launch in Shanghai with Alexandre Trudeau. In 1971, H√©bert founded Canada World Youth, an organization that expands \\"the role of youth in developing their communities and promoting world peace\\". He was appointed to the Senate on April 20, 1983, representing the senatorial division of Wellington, Quebec, and retired at the mandatory age of 75 in 1998. From 1991 to 1993 he was the Opposition Whip in the Senate and from 1993 to 1998 he was the Government Whip in the Senate.

RTL 4 is a general entertainment channel with infotainment, television drama, talk shows, game shows, news and talent shows. It is owned by RTL Nederland, a subsidiary of RTL Group. The station has three sister TV channels: RTL 5, RTL 7 and RTL 8, and four thematic TV channels: RTL Z, RTL Lounge, RTL Crime and RTL Telekids. Officially RTL 4 - along with RTL 5, RTL 7 and RTL 8 - is headquartered in Hilversum, broadcasting under a Luxembourg TV license. This allows them to avoid more strict control by the Dutch media authorities as Luxembourg's television watchdog is less strict. Despite being intended for Dutch audiences, RTL 4 is encrypted on the Dutch DVB-T Digitenne platform but free- to-air in Luxembourg. History It originally launched on the Astra 1A satellite as RTL V√©ronique on 2 October 1989, before re-branding as RTL 4 the next year. 1, 2 and 3 were already used by the Netherlands' public broadcasters. It was one of the first private commercial broadcaster in the Netherlands. Officially, it still broadcasts from Luxembourg. Private broadcasters were not allowed in the Netherlands until 1992. The encryption system employed by both RTL 4 and 5 analogue services whilst on the Astra 1A and 1C satellites was Luxcrypt. This standard was employed in order to protect the distribution rights sold by foreign studios to RTL. RTL 4 broadcasts the first and the longest running soap of the Netherlands, Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden (since 1 October 1990). RTL 4's latest radical change of programming was on 18 August 2007 when RTL obtained the soccer rights (Eredivisie) but lost the rights to the NOS the following year. In 2008 RTL 4 went back to its roots as a family entertainment channel with programmes such as Idols, X Factor, Dancing with the Stars and Dancing on Ice. That year RTL 4 also launched Ik Hou Van Holland, a quiz-show around and about the Netherlands with Linda De Mol. Logo from 2013-2016 From 2009 the talent shows are playing a major role in the programming of RTL 4, the X-Factor has been rescheduled successfully to Friday night with higher ratings in Season 2 (2009) and Season 3 (2010) on Fridays. In 2010, RTL 4 bought the rights for broadcasting Holland's Got Talent from SBS 6 and created together with pioneer John De Mol their own talent show The Voice of Holland in the Autumn of that same year. The Voice of Holland became a huge hit on Dutch Television with ratings around 3 million viewers every Friday Night. In 2012 yet another new talent show started, Beat the Best. RTL 4 also owns the rights for the soaps As the World Turns and The Bold and the Beautiful. In January 2007, RTL sold the rights for B&B; to SBS6, but bought the rights back in December 2010. With more money and space to buy other TV shows, RTL 4 bought the rights for the first season of the successful drama show Brothers & Sisters and took over CSI: Miami from sister channel RTL 5. Television host Peter van der Vorst has been appointed Content and Marketing Director of RTL Nederland. He will start on 1 March 2019. Radio From May 1991 until September 2006, the station has had several accompanying radio stations, such as RTL 4 Radio, RTL Radio, RTL Rock Radio, Happy RTL, and RTL FM. Between June 2007 and 1 January 2012 RTL Nederland owned Radio 538, one of the largest radio stations of the Netherlands. Programming Hits on RTL 4 include the RTL Nieuws, Editie NL, RTL Boulevard, Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden and the Saturday night family show Ik hou van Holland. Talent shows are also very popular on RTL 4, such as Idols, X Factor, Holland's Got Talent, Supernanny and The Voice of Holland. RTL 4 also owns the rights for American TV series. As is the practice with other television and film services nationwide, programmes in another language as well as portions of local programmes with foreign language dialogue are carried with Dutch subtitles in lieu of dubbing. =Domestic= Current =Game Shows= *BankGiro Miljonairs (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?) *E√©n tegen 100 *I Can See Your Voice (Dutch version of the South Korean program of the same name) *Vijf tegen Vijf (Family Feud) *De Zwakste Schakel (The Weakest Link) =News= *RTL Nieuws =Reality= *Bouwval gezocht (Property Ladder) *Dancing on Ice *Dancing with the Stars (British version of Strictly Come Dancing) *Eigen Huis & Tuin *Holland's Got Talent *The Voice of Holland *The Voice Kids *The Voice Senior =Soap Operas= *Goede tijden, slechte tijden =Talk Shows= *RTL Boulevard Past =Children's Shows= *De Club van Sinterklaas *Telekids =Comedy= *Gooische Vrouwen *Voetbalvrouwen (Footballers' Wives) =Drama= *Baantjer *Moordvrouw *Peter R. de Vries: Crime Reporter =Game Shows= *The Big Music Quiz (Dutch version of Le Grand Blind test) *Dit was het nieuws (Dutch version of Have I Got News for You) *Ik hou van Holland *De Jongens tegen de Meisjes *Het Moment Van De Waarheid =Reality= *Hoe schoon is jouw Huis?
