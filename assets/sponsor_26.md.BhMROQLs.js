They were built in middle of the twelfth century and are the only surviving elements of the mosque of Bahram Shah.C.E. Bosworth, The Later Ghaznavids, (Columbia University Press, 1977), 115. The two minarets are 600 meters (1968 feet) apart and lie in an open plain, north- east of Ghazni city. Both minarets of Ghazni are 20 metres (66 feet) tall and built of fired mud brick. The surface of the towers are decorated beautifully with intricate geometric patterns and Qurunic verses on elaborate terracotta tiles. In the 1960s, both towers were fitted with sheet metal roofs in a limited preservation effort. History The 12th century minarets are the most famous monuments of Ghazni city and are among the last surviving remnants of the great Ghaznavid Empire. The two minarets are called, Mas'ud III Minaret and Bahram Shah Minaret after the ruler who built them, Masud III (A.D. 1099-1115) and Bahram Shah (A.D. 1118-1157). The excavated palace of Mas'ud III lies nearby to the towers. An 1839 painting shows the cylindrical upper sections of the minarets before their destruction in 1902 earthquake. The minarets were taller before the upper sections were damaged and destroyed over time. Part of the Masud III minaret top was destroyed in an earthquake in 1902. Threats Ghazni Minarets are not well preserved or protected. Both towers are in danger from natural elements and the political instability in Afghanistan. There are no basic security measures in place to prevent vandalism and the towers are in need of new roofing to prevent water infiltration into the towers. The towers' facade contains intricate geometric patterns and Quranic inscriptions which are deteriorating rapidly with exposure to rain and snow. They are further affected by the nearby road and the area is subject to periodic flooding.

Geography  It is about 270 km from the state capital of Bangalore and 54 km from the city of Ballari. It was part of the Madras State and transferred to Karnataka after the formation of new states.  Etymology  Legend says that Gudekote was ruled by a king called Banasura, who was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Impressed by his devotion, the divine couple assured him that they would guard the village for eternity. The village was then the size of a city, and was known by the name of its ruler. British geologist and archaeologist Bruce Foote claimed that the boulders here are so huge, that he hadn't seen any of this size, in all of South India. Gude, in Kannada, is literally translated to a heap or a group. Gudekote is surrounded by hills with huge boulders. The fort (kote, in Kannada) is situated on top of one such rocky hill and possibly gave the name Gudekote to this village.  History  The ruins in and around the village date to prehistoric times. Stone age weapons and delicate ruins have been found in caves and by the sides of boulders, in Appayaganahalli, Panchalingeshwara, Doregudda and other places. Gudekote was once Mauryan rule, indicated by edicts in nearby Brahmagiri and Siddapura. Satavahana edicts have also been found in nearby Kottur, Kudligi, Shivapura, Choranur, Molakalmuru, Ashoka Siddapura and other places. It was later ruled by Badami and Kalyana Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and saw some development under the rule of Hoysalas and the kings of Hosamanedurga. Under the Vijayanagar empire, Gudekote was an important administrative centre of the palegars, who ruled for nearly 250 years. Gundalanayaka was the first palegar of Gudekote, along with Bommantaraja, Chinnayyaraja, Immadi Rajappanayaka, Jattingaraja and Shivappanayaka. Toward the end of the 18th century, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan captured Gudekote, which went back to the palegars after Tipu lost to the British in 1792. It was transferred to the Nizams in 1799, and then to the British in 1800, and joined Mysore State in 1947. It is believed that one of Karnataka's brave woman warriors, Onake Obavva, daughter of Chalavadi Chinnapa, was born in Gudekote.

There were six blast furnaces by 1804, and in 1806 about 7,500 tons of pig iron were produced, the ironworks being the fifth largest in Britain. The foundry made large castings for civil and mechanical engineers, the forge made plates and rods. The castings for Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, designed by Thomas Telford and built in 1795, were made at the works. When William Reynolds died in 1803, Ketley Ironworks were valued at ¬£110,000. His interests in the works were passed to Joseph. By 1816 demand had fallen, and he closed the works. The site was revived in 1818 by the newly created Ketley Company: the forge and three blast furnaces were again in use, and in 1830 about 5,750 tons of pig iron were produced.

He is considered a pioneer of biotremology for work on behavioural and anatomical basis of vibrational communication.  Early life and education  He was born as the eldest of five children to the writer Karl Gustav Ossiannilsson and his wife Naemi. After home schooling, he did military service and later enrolled at the Lund University, starting his work on insects. Ossiannilsson's first published paper (1934) dealt with the fauna of Auchenorrhyncha in Sweden. The following year he graduated and met his future wife Ingeg√§rd Malstr√∂m, with whom he married in 1938. That year, their daughter Maj was born.  Career  When World War II broke out, he was conscripted, but he continued doing entomological work in Sweden. To bolster the family's income, he secured a temporary position as an assistant at the National Institute of Plant Protection (Institutet f√∂r v√§xtskydd). The position became permanent in 1940, so he moved his family to Stockholm. Working as a general and applied entomologist, Ossiannilsson spent most of the time determining various pest insects, but Auchenorrhyncha as a group remained his specialty. Among other works at that time, he published a complete fauna of Auchenorrhyncha in Sweden. His interest was piqued by the claim that leafhoppers and planthoppers were silent, unlike the closely related cicada. However, he observed that members of the former two groups also possess tymbals with which cicadas produce sound, so he proposited that the sound is simply too faint to hear. He put an adult leafhopper in a glass tube and pushed the tube in his ear, after which he was able to detect faint vibrations. Thus, he discovered a new form of insect communication. He performed behavioural experiments with which he demonstrated that vibrations, not sound per se, were involved in male-female courtship, and completed an anatomical study of vibration-producing structures in numerous species. This work was to become his doctoral thesis, and was published as Insect drummers. A study on the morphology and function of the sound-producing organ of Swedish Homoptera Auchenorrhyncha with notes on their sound production (1949). Ossiannilsson even managed to record these vibrations and a phonograph record was produced. However, the theory that insects transfer information using substrate-borne vibrations was largely ignored by his contemporaries. Nine years later, this work was continued by the German entomologist Hildegard Str√ºbing, and later other researchers who established the basis of biotremology. In the meantime, Ossiannilsson became an assistant professor at the Agricultural college in Uppsala (now part of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences) and later full professor. There, he started working on the taxonomy of aphids, later returning to Auchenorrhyncha. He published several monographs on these groups for the series Fauna Entomologica Scandinavica. He created a collection of over 20,000 mounted specimens before retiring in 1974, but he continued taxonomical work even after that, expanding his interest to Psylloidea.  Final years  Most of Ossiannilsson's free time was devoted to field collecting Auchenorrhyncha as well. Beside entomology, his interests were art and gardening. After his last publication in 1992, he suffered a stroke which left him half paralyzed, so he quit researching. His wife looked after him until his death in 1995. His contribution to science is now recognized, among others, by the community of biotremologists who established the Insect Drummer Award for esteemed researchers.

She has appeared in numerous films, including Amai Muchi, The Torture Club, and the Nikkatsu film Wet Woman in the Wind, for which she received an Emerging Actress Award at the 26th Japanese Professional Movie Awards.  Biography  Mamiya was born March 9, 1991 in Aichi Prefecture. Under the name Yuki Mogami she worked as a gravure idol starting in 2009, but changed her professional name in 2012 to pursue an acting career. Mamiya started her film career with two Takashi Ishii films that were released in 2013. In the erotic thriller Amai Muchi she played the younger version of Naoko, with the older version of Naoko played by Mitsu Dan. She also appeared in the erotic romance film Hello, My Dolly Girlfriend, which was described by Mark Adams of Screen Daily as a \\"bizarre blend of voyeuristic sexuality and rather brutal violence\\". The next year she appeared in The Torture Club, an adaptation of Makoto Fukami's erotic comedy manga about a bondage club in a prestigious girls' school. In 2015 her photobook Trip was published by Takeshobo. Mamiya starred in the 2016 erotic suspense film ', an adaptation of an Edogawa Ranpo story.

Glenn Kenny, writing for The New York Times, remarked that Mamiya had \\"a smoldering quality that fit the bill\\" but suggested that \\"the 'roman porno' reboot project should have rebooted its sexual politics\\". Slant Magazine noted the film's resemblance to \\"vintage American screwball comedy, in which a rigid man is freed of his reservations by the uninhibited behavior of a beautiful and intelligent woman\\". Mamiya received an Emerging Actress Award at the 26th Japanese Professional Movie Awards for her performance in Wet Woman in the Wind. Mamiya appeared in a 2017 V-cinema spin-off of the Super Sentai television series Uchu Sentai Kyuranger and in the 2017 Yu Irie film '.

The fifth Maktoum Ruler since the establishment of the dynasty in 1833. Maktoum's short but 'liberal and enlightened' reign was to transform the coastal port. He was responsible for the establishment of the trading community of Dubai, encouraging disaffected merchants from Lingeh to bring their businesses to Dubai after the Persian government had introduced unpopular taxes.  Accession  Maktoum bin Hasher came to power following the death of his uncle, Sheikh Rashid bin Maktoum, who had entered into the 'Exclusive Agreement' of 1892 with the British. The latest in a number of treaties signed since the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, which bound the Trucial Sheikhs to maintain peace at sea, the Exclusive Agreement bound Dubai and its other signatories to protectorate status, including an undertaking not to \\"cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part territory, except to the British Government\\". His rule was contested by Sheikh Rashid's sons, Buti and Saeed, who were arrested and imprisoned in Dubai's Al Fahidi Fort. Following a period of intense campaigning from the friends of the two, Maktoum accepted an offer made by the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Saqr bin Khalid Al Qassimi, to take them as exiles and, after five months' imprisonment, they were freed and lived in Sharjah for the remainder of Maktoum's reign returning only on his death and the accession of Sheikh Buti bin Suhail Al Maktoum in 1906.  Rule  In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti - palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai, while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death. Despite these setbacks for the community, Maktoum's rule saw the fast expansion of the pearling industry as well as the opening of new businesses along Dubai's increasingly busy creekside wharfage. Dubai's population at the time was estimated by J. G. Lorimer at some 10,000 people, with 250 houses established at Shindagha, the traditional area settled by the Al Bu Falasah. In 1901, Maktoum established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh, but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the Al Qassimi tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly ‚Äì in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo. The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent.' Maktoum presided over the first formal meeting of the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast in April 1905. That meeting was attended by Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi of Sharjah, Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mualla of Umm Al Quwain, and Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Humaid Al Nuaimi of Ajman. The meeting was called as the result of a dispute which had arisen between Masfout and Hajarain (today known as Hatta) in the Wadi Hatta, in which the Bani Qitab tribe had built a fort in the wadi and were stopping caravans passing to and from Oman. Masfout at the time was linked to the Na'im of Buraimi, while Hajarain had been ceded to Sheikh Hasher bin Maktoum by the Omani Sultan, Turki bin Said. He also entered into a further treaty with the British in 1902, abolishing the arms trade.  The Fath Al Khair incident  In Autumn 1903, the Fath Al Khair, an Omani vessel flying a French flag, foundered off Dubai and there were accusations that it had been subsequently plundered. The vessel was regarded by the French Vice-Consul in Muscat as being under his protection and he applied directly to Maktoum bin Hasher for reparations, intending to despatch a cruiser to Dubai to enforce his message. At this point, the Government in India advised the British resident in the Persian Gulf to inform the French of the existence of the Exclusive Agreement and its terms. It was agreed in 1904 that the British would take over the French case and it was heard in the Sharia court in Dubai and compensation was awarded to the owner of the vessel, which had sunk as the consequence of a collision. This incident was the first test of the Exclusive Agreement, which in this instance benefited Dubai considerably.  Death  Maktoum died of heart disease in Dubai in on the 16 February 1906, leaving behind him a unified Dubai with a thriving port and a pearl trade directly employing some 7,000 men. He was succeeded by Sheikh Butti bin Suhail Al Maktoum.

The emblem is identical to the emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.  History  = First version = The first emblem of the Chuvash ASSR was identical to the emblem of the Russian SFSR. The differences were only in the inscription. = Second version = In the Constitution of the Chuvash Empire, adopted on January 31, 1926, stipulated that the republic may have a coat of arms and a flag. On February 25, 1926, at a meeting of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Chuvash ASSR, a commission was formed to develop the emblem and the flag of the republic. A contest for the best design of the coat of arms was organized. After finalizing the drafts at a meeting on December 10, 1926, the commission decided to adopt the coat of arms of Chuvashia with the following description: The emblem was designed by the artist and photographer P.E. Martens, a graduate of the Baron Stieglitz Institute (now Academy of Applied Arts).  First revision  By decree of the Presidium of the CEC of the Chuvash ASSR on January 3, 1927, the state coat of arms of the Chuvash ASSR was adopted with some changes: the background of the emblem became red, the sickle, the hammer, the stars and the rays - golden. The inscription \\"–ß–°–°–†\\" was represented in two languages: on the left - \\"–¢–∞–≤–∞—à—Å–µ–Ω –ê–≤—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º–ª–∞ –°–æ—Ç—Å–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å–∞–º–ø–∞ Council –†–µ—Å–ø—É–ø–ª–µ–∫–µ\\", and on the right - \\"–ß—É–≤–∞—à—Å–∫–∞—è –ê–≤—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º–Ω–∞—è –°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞\\".

The 2nd (7th) Congress of Soviets of the Chuvash Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic finally approved the coat of arms which was created in 1927, adopting the Resolution \\"On the State Coat of Arms of the Chuvash ASSR\\" on March 30, 1927. This decree established the following description of the emblem:  Second revision  On February 12, 1931, the IV (IX) Congress of Soviets of the Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic corrected the images of the coat of arms and the flag, adopting the decree \\"On the State Emblem and the Flag of the Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\\". Decorative elements in the form of the Chuvash national ornament were removed from the official symbols of the state due to \\"not reflecting the correct national policy of the proletarian state\\". A new description of the emblem was as: = Third version = July 18, 1938, the Chuvash ASSR adopted a new \\"Stalinist\\" Constitution of the Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. According to the text of the Constitution, the coat of arms of the Chuvash ASSR was the emblem of the RSFSR with some inscriptions in Chuvash style. The official blazon for the emblem from the Constitution of 1938:  First revision  The extraordinary VIII session of the 9th Supreme Soviet of the Chuvash ASSR on May 31, 1978 approved a new Constitution of the Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.

Life  Barthel was a born in Lohmen, Saxony to the ropemaker Clemens Barthel, who was an unsuccessful electoral candidate for the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1898. He began as a toolmaker at the Ernemann factory in Dresden, a renowned manufacturer of photography equipment. He became a member of the German Metal Workers' Union (DMV) and in 1923 joined the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD) and the Communist Party (KPD). In 1924 he became one of the first to be laid off in the wake of the financial crisis and hyperinflation of 1923. In 1927, he completed a training course for the KJVD at the Reichsparteischule for the Communist Party, and became KJVD district leader for eastern Saxony. He was sent by Conrad Blenkle and Fritz Rau to participate in the provincial party secretariat of the Communist Party in Suhl, Thuringia. The leader of the secretariat Hans Tittel was a supporter of Heinrich Brandler, who had fallen out of favour with leading members of the KPD and with Moscow. In order to remove the so-called \\"right-wing dissenters\\", the party demanded that the Thuringian KPD pass a resolution on the decisions of the 4th Session of the Central Council in Moscow. Walter Ulbricht was present for the vote on the proposals. Because of their \\"deviation from the party line\\", the so-called Brandlerists were then expelled. Ernst Th√§lmann then lauded praise upon the KJVD Thuringia under Karl Barthel. Many of the expelled supporters of Brandler went on to form the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition). = Parliamentary career = In December 1929 Barthel was elected to the Thuringian Landtag as the youngest member of the KPD faction. In 1930 he first met his future wife, Leni Streng, later to be a chemist. After a short time on the editorial board of the newspaper \\"Freedom\\" (\\"Freiheit\\") in D√ºsseldorf, in November 1931 Barthel was in Kassel and was confirmed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party following the recommendations of Thalmann and John Schehr to the post of political secretary for Hesse-Waldecks as successor to Kr√§mer, who had been imprisoned. In the 6th election (1932) he became one of the 89 deputies of the KPD in the Reichstag. In November 1932 he married Leni Streng. On 7 February 1933, he took part in the last meeting of the central committee in the Sportshaus Ziegenhals. After the Reichstag fire three weeks later, Barthel and all the other KPD deputies were declared criminals. Walter Ulbricht commissioned him as an instructor for Lower and Upper Silesia. = Arrest and sentence = On 28 November 1933, Barthel was arrested by the Gestapo in Breslau at a meeting with the local KJVD district leaders and was held in the custody of Edmund Heines. Three weeks later, he was removed to a private facility of the Marine SA following the discovery of an alleged escape route of which he was unaware. In his own communication, he merely confirmed the statements made the people with whom he met. On 28 March 1934, Barthel was imprisoned as a \\"police protection detainee\\" (Polizeischutzh√§ftling) in the Graupestra√üe prison in Breslau, and was sentenced in November to two and a half years in prison and five years of loss of civil rights (Ehrverlust). He was first transferred to a jail in Wohlau, then to the Lichtenburg concentration camp, and finally to the Buchenwald concentration camp. = Imprisonment in Buchenwald = : \\"The life of every prisoner in the concentration camp was constantly surrounded by death. Extreme restraint, vigilance, cunning and luck were needed if the prisoner wanted to avoid the threat of annihilation.\\" (translated from \\"Rot f√§rbt sich der Morgen\\") Barthel's block elder Hans Bremer along with he second block elder Oskar Fischer, in retroactive revenge for the \\"Felseneck process\\" and in place of two escaped criminals. Barthel worked in SS service buildings and was occasionally able to listen to Radio Berom√ºnster. Following the 1939 release of the first KPD Reichstag deputy from imprisonment in a concentration camp, Theodor Neubauer, Barthel was contacted by his wife. Through co- operative SS members such as the mechanic Hans Prinzler, he was able to smuggle out his manuscript to her, which was later published as Die Welt ohne Erbarmen (\\"The world without mercy\\") in the German Democratic Republic. In 1944, Barthel was sent to the Weimar Mews (Marstall Weimar) for 14 days, during which he was held in the same building where the disgraced former concentration camp commander Karl Otto Koch was imprisoned. He later declared that many Communist prisoners were killed after the Gestapo became aware of their being previously subjected to violent interrogations. Barthel himself was taken back to concentration camp without questioning. Barthel's friends in the concentration camp included Alois Neumann, later Minister of Justice of Czechoslovakia, who escaped from Czechoslovakia in 1939 (then the \\"Czech protectorate\\" under German control) and also Dr. Plojar. After the bomb attack by the US Air Force on 24 August 1944, Barthel was able to use his keys to the SS drink cellar to provide water to many of the wounded, including Rudolf Breitscheid and the Italian Princess Mafalda of Savoy, but both succumbed to their injuries. = Post-war period = After the war, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany appointed Barthel on 14 July 1945 to the position of mayor of Jena. Later after the merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), he became an SED member and director of public utilities in Jena. He died in Jena in 1974, aged 66.

Erskine was unsuccessful standing for parliament at Aberdeen Burghs at the 1713 general election, but was elected Member of Parliament for Aberdeen Burghs at the 1715 general election. However, he was unseated on petition on 22 July 1715. Erskine is believed to have taken an active part in the 1745 rebellion when he would have been 74.

It is located in the Bockenheim quarter of Frankfurt. A listed monument, it now serves as a theatre venue of the St√§dtische B√ºhnen Frankfurt, mostly for Baroque and contemporary opera.  History  Tram of type A in front of the Depot, c. 1900 Before 1900, a wooden hall existed here for the cars of the horse-drawn trams. Since it was not suitable for the new electric trams, it was demolished in 1900 and replaced by the current building, with an added wooden structure to house the main workshop for the trams (Hauptwerkstatt). While Frankfurt was badly damaged by bombing in 1944, the main hall suffered only minor damage. After the war, the hall became too small for growing traffic. The depot function was discontinued on 6 February 1966, and all facilities were then used for the workshop. In October 1978, a new depot was opened in Praunheim, while the old depot was closed. In 1979, the Depot was listed as a historic industrial monument (Industriedenkmal), as one of the first in the Rhein-Main area. The tram tracks remained until about 1986. All supporting structures were then demolished to make room for parking lots. The hall was occasionally used for events, such as performances of the Circus Roncalli in 1986. When the opera house was damaged by fire in November 1987, the Frankfurt Opera began to use the play theatre, and a new venue was needed for plays. In 1988, the Bockenheimer Depot was rebuilt as a theatre, designed by . An adjacent building was erected as a steel construction, and a square created in front of the historic hall. When the opera house was reopened in 1991, the depot was mainly used for guest performances. In 1994, an exhibition celebrated the 1200th anniversary of the city, called \\"FFM 1200/Tradition und Perspektiven einer Stadt\\" (Frankfurt am Main 1200/Traditions and perspectives of a city). From 1995, the company performed at the hall until it was dissolved in 2004. Since then, the facility, which belongs to the City of Frankfurt, has been used mostly by Oper Frankfurt, Schauspiel Frankfurt and sometimes the dance theatre Dresden Frankfurt Dance Company (formerly: The Forsythe Company). It can be rented for other events. The opera has used the building mostly for contemporary musical theatre and Baroque operas, including the first performance in Germany of the opera Nacht by Georg Friedrich Haas in 2005, and a production of Monteverdi's L‚ÄôOrfeo with Christian Gerhaher in the title role in 2008. In 2013, Emilio de Cavalieri's Spiel von K√∂rper und Seele was staged. In 2014, the opera Der goldene Drache by Peter E√∂tv√∂s received its world premiere. In the 2018/19 season, the German premiere of Olga Neuwirth's Lost Highway was directed by Yuval Sharon, with David Moss, among others.  Architecture  Bockenheimer Depot from the university The main building of the depot once served as a shed for trams. It was built in 1900 with three naves of yellow bricks with red cornices and decorations. The wooden roof construction goes back to models of the French Renaissance builder Philibert de l'Orme and has become rare. As a theatre venue, the hall now seats around 400 people. The depot is a listed monument according to Hessian law.  Literature  * Dieter H√∂ltge, G√ºnter H. K√∂hler: Stra√üen- und Stadtbahnen in Deutschland. 2nd ed. 1: Hessen.

The building is now part of University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The Industrial Savings Bank was founded in 1909 to serve merchants and factory workers on Flint's north side. However, during Flint's economic boom period in the first two decades of the twentieth century, the bank quickly grew, serving customers citywide. By 1913, the bank was ready to move into a new, larger building. However, it did not close the original location, becoming the first bank in the city to have multiple locations. Soon, Industrial Savings had six branch offices. By 1922, the bank was ready to expand again, and they hired the New York architectural firm of Davis, McGrath and Kiesling to design this building. Construction started in 1922 by the Realty Construction Co. of Flint, and the building was completed in 1923. In addition to housing the Industrial Savings Bank headquarters, the building also housed the Industrial Mutual Association, an early Flint benefit society. The Industrial Savings Bank flourished during the 1920s, and in 1929 merged with the Union Trust and Savings Bank. The new bank, the Union Industrial Trust and Savings Bank, began construction on a new building (now the home of the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation). The bank continued operations into the Great Depression, but like many banks experienced troubles, and closed permanently in 1933. The bank's assets, including the 1922 building, were placed in receivership. Several attempts were made to sell the building, but it was not until 1943 that the Greater Flint Industrial Union Council purchased it to use as offices for Congress of Industrial Organizations locals. The building, however, was underutilized, and in 1948 it was sold to a group of investors. Over the next few decades, it housed a variety of businesses, professionals, and governmental offices. In 1997, the University of Michigan‚ÄìFlint opted to purchase the building, now known as the Northbank Center. The building was refurbished in 2000, and as of 2018 houses the UM-Flint Dance Studio, various campus and community offices, a small business hatchery, and the Grand Ballroom. Description The Northbank Center is a twelve-story, L-shaped, Renaissance Revival building measuring 99 feet by 150 feet, and located on a corner lot. On the main facade, the first three floors form a base, divided into three major bays by paired and fluted pilasters with Corinthian capitals. The pilasters are limestone, with the interior of the bays formed by rusticated granite and multi-pane windows. The base is capped with a limestone architrave, frieze, and cornice with the founding dates and the words \\"Industrial Savings Bank Building\\" in the entablature. The facade above is ten bays wide, with a piano nobile stretched over seven floors. Each bay contains a double hung sash window. Construction is brick, with a limestone bandcourse every two floors and rusticated granite quoining on the corners. A double- molded bandcourse separates the main section from the upper two floors. The eleventh floor has twelve six-pane casement windows separated by limestone panels. A corniceline is above the eleventh floor, and the twelfth floor is recessed, forming a roof top terrace, with the twelfth floor facade nearly invisible from the street level. The twelfth floor similar to the eleventh, but has a stucco finish and a decorative balustrade. The side facade is eight bays wide at the ground floor. The facade is similar to the main side, but for the elimination of the paired pilasters in the base, and the twelfth floor, which is recessed only in the corner sections.

She was active in the Western Sydney suburbs of Fairfield and Cabramatta focusing on services for women in minority communities, including advocacy to prevent honour killings and freeing girls from forced marriages. In 2018, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, a government appointed corruption commission, ruled that Sharobeem had stolen over $750,000 from the charities she managed and had falsified her qualifications. Prior to the ICAC investigation, Sharobeem was widely held as female activist and was appointed to various government advisory boards. Activism Sharobeem's activism focuses on the areas of women's health and underage marriages. According to Sharobeem, a small number of child bride cases exist in Australia today. Ms Sharobeem's activism was underlined by her personal story of being forced into an arranged marriage at 15-years-old and living through years of domestic abuse before becoming a widow at age 29, however, during the 2017 corruption case against her, the claim Sharobeem was a child bride was discovered to be false.https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/revealed-sharobeem-family- sent-500000-to-relative-in-egypt-after-icac-grilling-20170621-gwve6n.html Sharobeem was appointed as a member of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board, the Community Relations Commission (both state government bodies), as well as immigrant women organisational bodies.

ICAC concluded that Sharobeem misused public funds while managing IWHS and NESH for the financial benefit of herself and members of her family, including her son Richard Sherobeem's cosmetic liposuction procedure. ICAC also investigated Sharobeem's false claim of academic qualifications which she used to gain employment at the Community Relations Commission (CRC) and to become a member of the Anti- Discrimination Board (ADB) of NSW. The investigation was titled by ICAC as \\"Operation Tarlo.\\" ICAC initially referred the case to NSW Crime Commission and the Supreme Court ruled to freeze Sharobeem's financial assets. =FACS investigation= Prior to the ICAC investigation, the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services (FACS) conducted its own preliminary investigation following anonymous complaints from staff at Sharobeem's organisation.

It was built from 1840 to 1850. It is also known as Dover. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 29 September 2000.  History  Based on an analysis of the building fabric and the existing land title information, it is considered it was constructed around 1840 and would have been a worker's cottage on land owned by Alexander Brodie Spark, the man who built Tempe House in the 1830s. The first registered land grant for the site was 470 acres. It was made in October 1799 to Thomas Smythe, Provost Marshall by Gov. Hunter Oct 1799. Smythe died in 1804 and the land eventually passed to his senior, John Palmer. John Palmer (Commissionary) sold it to his brother-in-law Robert Campbell in 1808. Campbell held it for 27 years and sold 63 acres bordering Cooks River and O'Shea's Creek (the site of old Tempe Village) to Alexander Brodie Spark in 1835. In 1842 Spark surveyed both St Peters and Tempe village areas for their future sale. 63 acres at Tempe were mortgaged to the Bank of Australia. In 1850 156 allotments, part of the Village of Tempe (700 allotments) (Lot 43 block 2 is 44 Barden St) were sold to Edward Flood. In 1854 Edward Flood sold a lot, including lot 43 block 2, to Joseph Nobbs. In 1861 Joseph Nobbs sold 3 lots, including lot 43 to Frederick Barden. The street was later renamed from Campbell to Barden Street after Frederick.  Description  Interior wall showing original split timber vertical slabs The building is a split timber slab cottage. Originally roofed with she-oak shingles, now roofed with corrugated steel roof sheeting. It is now clad with aluminum sheeting on walls, except for one rear wall in brick. The front two rooms were the original slab cottage, with the remainder of the building having been added later. It was reported as at 15 June 2000 that the underneath of the cottage retained some archaeological surface deposits that were relatively undisturbed. At least two-thirds of original fabric of the original two room cottage remains. It shows aspects of original construction and is in relatively good condition. = Modifications and dates = # Original Cottage constructed between 1840 and 1850 # Brick wall (230mm by 2650mm) extension part of workshop then kitchen post 1850 # Main rear lean-to 1950s # Smaller kitchen and bathroom add 1960s # Bear Shed 1960s # Original cottage lined internally (gyprock) 1970s  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The timber slab cottage at 44 Barden Street Tempe dates from the mid-19th century. It is a rare surviving example of the type of vernacular rudimentary timber building built in early Sydney. The house is one of the oldest houses in Tempe and is on land which was part of an original land grant dating back to 1799. It was constructed 1840, and would have been a worker's cottage on land owned by A.B. Spark, the man who built Tempe House in the mid-1830s. The walls are made up of vertical timber slabs which have been split. The hardwood slabs have been crudely thinned at each end and are fixed with original \\"Ewbank\\" nails (produced from 1838‚Äì70). The walls have been painted with multiple layers of limewash. The gaps between the timber slabs have been caulked with a lime putty made from slaked rock lime. The interior walls are timber lath and plaster. The floors are hardwood pit-sawn timber, with saw markings and square edge detailing fixed on round joists with the remnants of the original bark still preserved. The foundations are sandstone piers set into a sand clay footing. Timber Slab Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 29 September 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Land Grants for the site go back to October 1799. The original grant of 470 acres was used for agricultural purposes farmed with assigned convicts. The land was also owned by Robert Campbell who built Tempe House across the river. He sold the land at about this time possibly to help pay for Tempe House. It is probably the oldest extant vernacular house in Tempe. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Small cottage form evident from street. The original southern exterior wall is now part of the living room which is now internal. This wall is 6m slab wall and 2.7m. The adjacent 19th century brick wall is also visible. The cottage is a rare example of a rudimentary timber slab cottage. Although the exterior is now encapsulated within modern aluminum weatherboard cladding it is visible on the inside wall of the living room. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is significant because it shows an example of a small domestic house from early Sydney. It was constructed c.1840 and would have been a worker's cottage on land owned by A.B. Spark, the man who built Tempe House in the 1830s. The house shows how older buildings are set on sites at a skew angle and do not always align with new sub-divisions. This provides evidence of an earlier occupation before sub division. It is one of the oldest house in the area and provides evidence of early land use. Grooves in the rear wall show evidence of early steam driven machines. This may have been associated with the agricultural development or be part of some small industry manufacturing process. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Provides evidence of the technology of slab cottages in the middle of the 19th century. The house is raised of the ground and uses nails to fix the slabs which have been roughly thinned out to receive the \\"Ewbank\\" nails. The construction shows a reasonable understanding of carpentry techniques and uses mortise and tenon joints. Accommodation seems above normal for convict/ lessee/ or shepherd. More likely built for a supervisor or farm caretaker for owners. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This type of vertical timber slab construction is rare, particularly in the Sydney region. It is similar to Dundullimal Homestead, Dubbo.

It was built in the 13th century surrounding the Ghazni town to form a walled city. The 45 metre (147 foot) high citadel dominates the skyline. The citadel is at risk of destruction due to multiple threats. Already more than half of the citadel's 32 original towers have been destroyed or heavily damaged with the collapse of one tower being caught on video in June, 2019 and being shared widely on social media. The citadel is located in the center of the city and nearby major roads. A lack funds to aid in the site's preservation, heavy rains, and the country's ongoing civil war have further contributed to the citadel's collapse. History Painting by James Rattray shows town and Citadel of Ghazni, 1839-1842 In 962, the Turkic slave commander of the Samanid Empire, Alp-Tegin, attacked Ghazni and besieged the citadel for four months. He wrested Ghazni from the Lawik ruler, Abu Bakr Lawik. Alp-Tegin was accompanied by Sabuktigin during this conquest. In 1839, the citadel was the site of the battle of Ghazni during the first Anglo-Afghan war when the British troops stormed and captured the citadel. It saw further violence during later decades of wars. On 14 June 2019, a tower collapsed due to heavy rain and possible government negligence. Threats The old citadel of Ghazni is in a deteriorating condition. Many of the towers and walls of the fortress are crumbling. Decades of war and continued political instability in Afghanistan have contributed to the deterioration of the fortress. War and lack of funds have hampered restoration efforts. In June, 2019 one of the fort's 32 original towers collapsed and was caught on video and posted to social media sparking international calls for the Afghan government and international community to do more to preserve the country's cultural heritage.
