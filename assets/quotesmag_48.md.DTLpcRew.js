The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire. The Mexican insurgents were commanded by Mariano Matamoros y Guridi and the Spanish by Agustín Cosme Damián de Iturbide y Arámburu who would later go on to become the Mexican emperor, and by Ciriaco del Llano. The battle lasted approximately one hour and resulted in a victory for the Spanish Royalists. The battle This short battle was a complete loss for the Mexican rebels. After a battle lasting about an hour, the smaller royalist army soundly defeated the Mexican rebels inflicting heavy casualties. The Mexican commander, Mariano Matamoros was captured whilst attempting to flee the field of battle by a loyalist cadet named Eusebio Rodríguez. In addition to losing a majority of their army, the Mexicans also lost 23 artillery pieces and around 1,000 muskets to the Spanish.  Aftermath  After taking stock of their tremendous losses, the Mexican rebels attempted to bargain for the life of General Matamoros who had been the second in command of José María Morelos' forces. They petitioned the government of the Spanish Viceroyalty for a prisoner exchange where they would return 200 captured royalist soldiers for Matamoros. The Spanish refused the offer and ordered the execution by firing squad of Matamoros on 3 February 1814. After the death of Matamoros, José María Morelos ordered the execution of all 200 Spanish royalist prisoners.

History  It was founded as the Fatima Institute on October 8, 2005, by the Emeritus of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Makeni led by Reverend George Biguzzi (born 1n 1936, Italy). In August 2009, it was granted university status and took its present name. Owned by the Diocese of Makeni, and the Bishop of Makeni is the university chancellor. In 2011, along with City of Rest and the Community Association for Psychosocial Services (CAPS), UNIMAK became a founding member of the Mental Health Coalition (MHC) of Sierra Leone. Specializing in mental health service provision, academia, and advocacy, the consortium of organizations has been at the forefront of calls for reform of the mental health sector in Sierra Leone. Ebola restrictions forced a temporary closure of the University of Makeni between 2014 and 2016. In 2018, UNIMAK created an additional campus in the Koinadugu District of Sierra Leone. The campus is located in Kabala Town and UNIMAK is the first University to have begun operations in the district. In 2018, the university's application fees were eliminated for application forms as part of an initiative championed by President Julius Maada Bio to improve access to higher education for young people. In 2019, the University became a founding member of the First Responder Coalition of Sierra Leone (FRCSL), with the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society, LFR International, the Holy Spirit Hospital, and Agency for Rural Community Transformation (ARCT). The Coalition's mission was to \\"facilitate the development of emergency first responder programs to alleviate the burden of traumatic injury in Sierra Leone.\\"  Governance  The university is privately owned by the Emeritus of the Catholic Diocese of Makeni and is the first private university in the country owned by the Catholic Mission. It is also governed by members of the Makeni University Governing Council.  Programs  As a research-oriented university, there is a large breadth to the research being conducted at UNIMAK. = Public Health = Representatives from the University of Makeni and Makerere University in Uganda met with academics from the School of Public Health at the Imperial College London to discuss building institutional capacities to provide public health education. The partnership has helped build the health education program at the University.  Ebola  In 2015, during the latter stages of the Ebola crisis outbreak, researchers from the University of Cambridge and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute studying unconventional transmission of Ebola by sequencing the virus in real-time initially constructed temporary genome sequencing facilities to provide in-country sequencing capabilities to process patient samples from Makeni. Since the end of the crisis, the facilities have since been moved to the University, where they have formed the UNIMAK Infectious Disease Research Laboratory. The laboratory provides training for local scientists and students, crucial to sequencing and managing continued Ebola cases in Makeni without international collaborators present. UNIMAK has been a leader in the PREDICT Ebola Host Project, as one of two Sierra Leonean institutions involved in the project (the other being Njala University). The PREDCIT project is a USAID-funded project headquartered at the UC-Davis One Health Institute. Subsequent to the Ebola Crisis, two groups began searching for hemorrhagic disease reservoirs in West Africa to preempt future crises. One group was led by the CDC and Njala University, while the other was led by UC-Davis and UNIMAK. As a result of the project, scientists were able to discover an Ebola virus species (Marburg Virus) in a host (fruit-eating bats) prior to detection in an infected human or sick animal for the first time ever. = Special Needs Educators Program = UNIMAK is currently the only university in Sierra Leone to offer special needs teacher training. The absence of special needs teachers in Sierra Leone to educate disabled children has become a priority for the Ministry of Education, having assured the government that it is championing policy for the expansion of these programs in Parliament based on UNIMAK's programs.

It began test broadcasting on January 16, 2012, and full-fledged broadcasting on January 22. Until June 10, 2013, it was a monosport television channel: \\"Hockey,\\" which also included the news online portal xsport.ua  History  On June 1, 2011, the National Council of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting at a meeting decided to issue a satellite broadcasting license to Totveld LLC. The logo and name of the channel according to the application were “Hockey”. Then it was announced that the channel would begin broadcasting “in January - February 2012”. On August 18, 2011, the channel won the National Council competition, and received a license for digital broadcasting. At the end of May, 2013, the owner of the channel decided to renew the license and change the channel name to “XSPORT”, as well as expand the broadcasting concept, showing not only hockey, but also other sporting events. On June 10, 2013, the channel was officially rebranded. XSPORT positions itself as the only Ukrainian multisport channel promoting a healthy lifestyle. The mission of the channel is to draw attention to Ukrainian sports. Along with classic sports - hockey, boxing, martial arts, athletics, tennis, swimming, handball - the channel offers its viewers sports-themed films, extreme sports and sport fishing programs. Due to many factors, such as the war in the east of Ukraine, the difficult economic situation in the country, and the instability of the exchange rate, the XSPORT channel decided on January 1, 2015 to suspend its own television broadcasting. First of all, such measures were associated with the inability to allocate a budget for purchasing high-quality foreign content, which would have had to be done in foreign currency. Thus, the channel suspended broadcasting to optimize technical costs. As for online broadcasting and the official site of the XSPORT channel, such a decision did not affect their work. The online resource continued to inform Ukrainian fans about sporting events in Ukraine and around the world. On April 13, 2016, XSPORT resumed broadcasting on the satellite and on the T2 digital network after a forced pause. On November 9, 2017, the channel updated the logo and graphic design, which were then in yellow and blue colors.

Unusually for a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, the Model W had a flat-twin engine and a trailing link fork. The Model W set speed records on runs from New York City to Chicago and from the Canada–United States border to the Mexico–United States border. Slow home market sales led to the end of production after four years. Design W. S. Harley's patented compression release system. Note the screw caps in the cylinder heads giving access to the valves. 1922 Harley-Davidson WJ Harley- Davidson's intention in introducing a new middleweight model was to increase the size of the motorcycle market by appealing to new riders with an entry- level product. The design imitated the British Douglas motorcycle flat-twin with cylinders in line with the frame, and offered several features that were meant to bring new motorcyclists into the market, including a smoother running engine than a typical Harley-Davidson V-twin, a lower center of gravity for easier handling, and a design that kept the rider and the motorcycle cleaner from oil and the dirt that oil attracted. It was cleaner because there were fewer oil compartments, due to the transmission and clutch being integrated with the engine crankcase, providing fewer ways for the oil to leak. In addition, an optional drive chain enclosure could keep chain lubricant off the motorcycle and the rider's clothing. =Drivetrain= The engine components were designed for ease of access and maintenance. The valve guides and valves could be removed without removing the engine from the motorcycle. The cylinder heads were integral with the engine. The intake and exhaust manifolds were cast as one piece such that the exhaust would heat the fuel mixture to improve fuel atomization. The engine had a large external flywheel on the left side similar to that on the horizontal single-cylinder Moto Guzzi. The Model W engine was Harley-Davidson's first flathead engine, and its transmission was the first in a Harley-Davidson motorcycle to be housed in the engine cases. The transmission included helical gear drive, a wet clutch, and a three-speed gearbox. The engine was a stressed member of the frame. =Suspension= The front suspension was by a trailing-link fork, unlike those on other Harley- Davidsons, which used leading-link forks at the time. =Electrical system and ignition= The Model W initially used a magneto-powered ignition system, but a battery and coil system became available with the Model WJ in 1921. The Model WF continued with magneto ignition. Electric lighting became available on the Model W in 1920. =Accessories and trim= The Model W had a standard luggage carrier on the rear fender. In 1921, the tank logos were changed to be similar to those on Harley-Davidson's larger V-twin motorcycles. Endurance records In July 1919, the Model W became the first motor vehicle of any kind to climb Mount San Antonio, near Mount Baldy, California. A contractor rode a Model W 1,200 miles through Death Valley surveying sites for hotels and rail lines, without problems with the motorcycle. Hap Scherer, a publicity manager for Harley-Davidson, set record times on endurance runs from British Columbia to Tijuana and from New York to Chicago. Demise Beam-framed motorcycle with Model W drivetrain, patented by W. S. Harley and A. Ziska, Jr. The Model W never sold well in the United States, and the expected crowd of new riders taking up motorcycling on Sport Twins did not appear. In 1920, a year after the introduction of the Model W, Indian began offering their Scout, which was similar in size, faster, and much more popular. The Model W cost more than a used Ford Model T and about nine-tenths the cost of Harley-Davidson's one litre V-Twin motorcycle, making it attractive neither as basic transportation nor as a sporting vehicle. Although the Model W sold well in Europe, Harley- Davidson discontinued it in 1923 in favor of promoting their single-cylinder models there. William S. Harley and Adam Ziska Jr. patented a steel beam frame design for use with the Model W drivetrain. Collection and exhibition 1919 Harley-Davidson Model W on display at the Spring 2005 exhibition of The Art of the Motorcycle in Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.A. A Model W Sport Twin was lent by the Chandler Vintage Museum of Transportation and Wildlife to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum for the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in New York, and for the Fall 2001 Guggenheim Las Vegas show. For the Spring 2005 follow-on The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at Wonders: The Memphis International Cultural Series, a Model W from the collection of Motorcycle Hall of Famer Bob McClean was shown.

Also known as a ground anchor, percussion driven earth anchor or mechanical anchor, it may be impact driven into the ground or run in spirally, depending on its design and intended force-resistance characteristics. Earth anchors are used in both temporary or permanent applications, including supporting retaining walls, guyed masts, and circus tents. History The first practical earth anchor was invented in 1912 by Albert Bishop Chance in Centralia, Missouri, in response to an ice storm that knocked down his companies telephone poles. The town of Centralia holds an annual Anchor Day Festival.  Applications  guy wires on a guyed mast near Thabazimbi, South Africa Earth anchors are typically used in civil engineering and construction projects, and have a variety of applications, including: * Retaining walls, as part of erosion control systems. Core Applications, retrieved 2012-07-09 * Structural support of temporary buildings and structures,Geotechnical Engineering Circular No. 4 retrieved 2012-07-09 such as circus tents and outdoor stages. * Tethering marine structures, such as floating docks and pipelines. * Supporting guyed masts, such as radio transmission towers. * Anchoring utility poles and similar structures. * Drainage systems, for loadlocking and restraining capability to happen simultaneously. Platipus Anchors, retrieved 2012-07-09 * Landscape, anchoring trees, often semi-mature transplants.Patent 2765764 Summary * General security, as in anchoring small aircraft. * Sporting activities, such as slacklining or abseiling.  Types  = Deadman = A deadman is one of the simplest ground anchors in terms of equipment needed, and is suitable for light loads or temporary installations. It is a horizontal beam, such as a log or steel girder, placed crosswise to the load and buried in a hole in the ground. It can be constructed with as little as a tree branch, adequate rope and adequate digging. A deadman may also be placed on the surface, held in place by a number of picket stakes. This allows a greater load to be taken than a single row of pickets.  Performance  Once installed and load- locked, an earth anchor exerts effort to the soil above it, with the soil in turn providing resistance. Upward soil compression created by the anchor is typically exerted in a frustum shaped cone, reflecting: * The shear angle of the soil * The depth at which the anchor has been installed * The load applied to the anchor * The size of the anchor and size and angle of its lateral surfaces When angled these lateral surfaces generate greater cone-shaped soil resistance than a simple cylinder created by purely perpendicular design.  Installation  Site analysis determining soil load resistance is often required before earth anchor installation. Included are depth that the anchor is to be driven, and soil strength, moisture content, and corrosivity. When appropriate, test installations are done to determine optimal anchor design or conformance with project specifications. Installation methods differ depending on soil composition and moisture. Earth anchors are commonly driven into the ground using a drive rod and impact hammer. Pilot holes are required in denser soils. After an impact driven anchor has been installed, the drive rod is removed and the anchor load-locked, typically by rotating it ninety degrees. For lighter anchors a hand tool is often sufficient.

The church, which was built in 1917, was designed by Nick Ressler with elements of the Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles. The church has historically served a unique congregation of Czech immigrants from the Crimea and is considered to be the most significant representation of New Hradec's Czech heritage. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History New Hradec was founded in 1887 by Bohemian immigrants from the Crimea; its first settlers are the only documented Bohemian immigrants from the Crimea to have settled in America. These settlers established the parish of Saints Peter and Paul in 1898 by building a wood church. This church burned down in May 1917, and the congregation built the current structure later in the year. The new church was dedicated and its cornerstone laid on August 19, 1917; it was designed by Nick Ressler of Mandan and contracted by Charles Bakke of Dickinson. From 1918 to 1950, the church also served as a school, with classes taught by the Sisters of Notre Dame. Throughout its history, the church has used the Czech language, hosted and been supported by Czech cultural organizations and has been a defining institution for the Czech community of New Hradec. Due to its cultural significance to the local Czech community, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 3, 1986. Architecture Saints Peter and Paul Church was built with common and brown brick and exhibits elements of the Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles. In particular, Tudor influences can be seen in the tracery on the windows, the archway around the door, and the church's buttresses. The structure consists of a church and a school building, the latter being approximately half the size of the former. The church has a bell tower with an eight-sided wooden spire at its peak. The interior of the church seats 300 and has a high degree of historical integrity, including the original wood floors and pews. A significant amount of plaster statues can be found inside the church, including plaster Stations of the Cross. The church is considered to have remarkable integrity of both design and building materials for its location and function.

Dotted with centres of learning (agrahara), Balligavi was an important city during the 11th - 12th century Western Chalukya rule. The term Anadi Rajadhani (ancient capital) used in medieval inscriptions to describe this town tells a tale of great antiquity. Art historian Adam Hardy classifies the style involved in the construction of the temple as \\"Later Chalukya, non mainstream, relatively close to mainstream\\". He dates the temple to late 11th century, with inscriptional evidence of additions made up to 1131, by the Hoysalas during their control over the region. The building material used is soapstone. The Archaeological Survey of India classifies the style of architecture as distinctly Hoysala.Hardy (1995), p324 The Hoysala ruling family was during this period a powerful feudatory of the imperial Western Chalukya Empire, gaining the trappings of independence only from the period of King Vishnuvardhana (1108-1152 A.D).During the rule of King Vinyaditya (1047–1098), the Hoysalas established themselves as a powerful Chalukya feudatory (Chopra 2003, p151, part 1)Sen (1999), p498Foekema (1996), p14 The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. Deity The cella (garbhagriha) in the shrines to the west and south contain the Shivalinga (the universal symbol of the Hindu god Shiva) and the cella to the north has an image of the god Vishnu. The temple is connected with the legend of demon Bali according to some lithic records. In its heyday, the temple attracted a large number of followers of the Kalamukha sect of Shaivism. A four faced image of the god Brahma, which at one time may have been inside the temple, is on display in a museum within the temple complex.

The western shrine has a vestibule where as the other two shrines have a \\"half hall\\" (ardhamantapa). All shrines open up to a six-pillared hall called mahamantapa which is preceded by a large ornate open \\"gathering hall\\" called sabhamantapa. The layout of the gathering hall is \\"staggered square\\" which has the effect of creating projections and recesses. Each projection of the wall has a complete \\"architectural articulation\\" (achieved by repetitive decoration).Foekema (1996), pp 21-22 The gathering hall has entrances from the north, south and eastern directions. Decoration The outer walls of the shrines are quite austere save for the pilasters that are capped by miniature decorative towers (aedicula).Foekema (1996), p28 The superstructures over the shrines are 3-tiered (tritala arpita) vesara (combination of south and north Indian style) with the sculptural details being repeated in each tier. The temple exhibits other standard features present in a Hoysala style temple: the large decorative domed roof over the tower; the kalasha on top of it (the decorative water-pot at the apex of the dome); and the Hoysala crest (emblem of the Hoysala warrior stabbing a lion) over the sukhanasi (tower over the vestibule).

Moth traps are devices used by entomologists to capture moths. Most use a light source. Pheromone traps are also used. All moth traps follow the same basic design - consisting of a mercury vapour or actinic light to attract the moths and a box in which the moths can accumulate and be examined later. The moths fly towards the light and spiral down towards the source of the light and are deflected into the box. Besides moths, several other insects will also come to light, such as scarab beetles, Ichneumonid wasps, stink bugs, stick insects, diving beetles, and water boatmen. Occasionally diurnal species such as dragonflies, yellowjacket wasps, and hover flies will also visit. A simple moth trap The reason insects and especially particular families of insect (e.g. moths), are attracted to light is uncertain . The most accepted theory is that moth migrate using the moon and stars as navigational aids and that the placement of a closer than the moon light causes subtended angles of light at the insects eye to alter so rapidly that it has to fly in a spiral to reduce the angular change -- this resulting in the insect flying into the light. Yet the reason some diurnal insects visit is entirely unknown. A more complex moth trap Some moths, notably Sesiidae are monitored or collected using pheromone traps.

The year at which the century changes is called the pivot year of the date window. Date windowing was one of several techniques used to resolve the year 2000 problem in legacy computer systems. Reasoning For organizations and institutions with data that is only decades old, a \\"date windowing\\" solution was considered easier and more economical than the massive conversions and testing required when converting two-digit years into four-digit years. Windowing methods There are three primary methods used to determine the date window: * Fixed pivot year: simplest to code, works for most business dates. * Sliding pivot year: determined by subtracting some constant from the current year, typically used for birth dates. * Closest date: Three different interpretations (last century, this century, and next century) are compared to the current date, and the closest date is chosen from the three. =FOCUS= Information Builders's FOCUS \\"Century Aware\\" implementation allowed the user to focus on field- specific and file-specific settings. This flexibility gave the best of all three major mechanisms: A school could have file RecentDonors set a field named BirthDate to use ::DEFCENT=19 YRTHRESH=31, covering those born 1931-2030. Those born 2031 are not likely to be donating before 2049, by which time those born 1931 would be 118 years old, and unlikely current donors. DEFCENT and YRTHRESH for a file containing present students and recent graduates would use different values. Examples Unix and Windows systems have environment variables that set the fixed pivot year for the system. Any year after the pivot year will belong to this century (the 21st century), and any year before or equal to the pivot year will belong to last century (the 20th century). Some products, such as Microsoft Excel 95 used a window of years 1920–2019 which had the potential to encounter a windowing bug reoccurring only 20 years after the year 2000 problem had been addressed. Below is a simple example of fixed date windowing COBOL code, often used to figure the century for ordinary business dates. IF RECEIPT-DATE-YEAR >= 60 MOVE 19 TO RECEIPT-DATE-CENTURY ELSE MOVE 20 TO RECEIPT-DATE-CENTURY END-IF. The above \\"fixed-60\\" code establishes a fixed date window of 1960 through 2060.

Undergone several incarnations, it began its airing on July 16, 2012 and was axed on February 12, 2016 to give way to the expansion of CNN Philippines Newsroom. Background =TalkTV/Solar News Channel Era (2012-2014)= Formerly anchored by ABS-CBN news presenter Nancy Irlanda, the newscast was first known as Solar Nightly News and was launched on July 16, 2012 on Talk TV, by then aired on SBN UHF Channel 21. The launch of the newscast was a result of the formation as Solar Television Network's news and current affairs division, which in turn was brought by the privatization of Radio Philippines Network (RPN) by Solar Entertainment. It was carried over upon the channel's rebranding as Solar News Channel in October 30. Solar Nightly News was simulcasted on RPN (by then affiliated by Solar Entertainment-operated ETC) from January 14 until November 29, 2013 after the network ceased production of its late-night newscast RPN NewsCap due to the retrenchment of the program's production team and other employees of the privatized network. The simulcast was also a replacement of Solar Network News to RPN's news content, as a result of Solar Entertainment's decision to scrap the cable-only limitation of American Idol season 12 and allow the broadcast to be available to RPN (over-the-air) viewers (in which the original plan was to limit the AI via satellite broadcast to cable viewers while RPN will continue to air Network News at 6 PM). On December 1, 2013, Solar News Channel switched its affiliation to RPN, making it a program at its own right. Nancy Irlanda retired as the newscast's anchor on January 10, 2014; Mitzi Borromeo, anchor of Solar News program News Café took over by the end of the month. Hilary Isaac joined Borromeo weeks later but left some months later to join Daybreak. =9TV Era (2014-2015)= Solar Nightly News dropped the Solar branding on July 21, 2014 upon the impending acquisition of Solar Television Network (which turned into Nine Media Corporation) to the ALC Group of Companies a month later, with a new titlecard and graphic introduced on August 25, 2014 following channel's rebrand to 9TV. Mitzi Borromeo was held over as anchor. During the newscast's tenure, it also kept its one-hour runtime. =CNN Philippines Era (2015-2016)= The final incarnation was launched on March 16, 2015 in lieu with the launch of CNN Philippines along with a CNN-themed graphics and a revamped news studio. However, the newscast was cut to a half-hour to make way for the network's current affairs block. It also debuted segments such as Nightly Focus and Heads Up, a peek on the following day's headlines.

His academic speciality was modern Japanese history and he was a professor emeritus at Hitotsubashi University. In 1980 he became a member of the Science Council of Japan and was a former chairman of the Historical Science Society of Japan.  Life  He was born in Tokyo and after graduating from Rokuchu Tokyo Prefectural School, now Shinjuku Tokyo Metropolitan High School, in March 1940, he was part of the 55th graduating class at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in July 1941 and the following December was deployed to North China as a trainee officer with the rank of Second Lieutenant attached to the 27th Division’s 3rd China Garrison Infantry Regiment. In March 1943 he was promoted to First Lieutenant and in April was put in charge of a company. In 1944 his division moved to a new front and participated in Operation Ichi-Go, after which he was promoted to captain. In March 1945 in the final stages of World War II he was ordered to transfer to mainland Japan and in June was appointed as commander of a battalion within the 524th Infantry Regiment of the 216th Division in preparation for the expected invasion of Japan. He survived the war and in November was sent into the reserves. In May 1946 Fujiwara enrolled in history courses at the department of humanities at Tokyo Imperial University, now the University of Tokyo and graduated in March 1949. From 1954 to 1968 he worked as a part-time lecturer in the department of humanities and sciences at Chiba University. Then in 1967 he started a new job at Hitotsubashi University and in November accepted the position of associate professor in the department of sociology. In December 1969 he became a full professor and, in 1970, the head of his department. He left Hitotsubashi University in 1986 due to compulsory retirement but the same year got a part-time job as a lecturer in Rikkyo University’s department of humanities. Between 1989 and 1993 he was a professor at Kagawa Education Institute of Nutrition.  Research  In the beginning he specialized in the medieval history of Japan but on the advice of Sho Ishimoda he switched to modern history and broke new ground in the history of the Showa period. He engaged in research on the modern history of Japan focusing on military and political history due to his experience as a professional soldier and his reflections on that. He was influenced academically by Kiyoshi Inoue. Fujiwara’s name became widely known in 1955 when his book Shōwa Shi that he co-authored with fellow historians Shigeki Tooyama and Seiichi Imai became a bestseller. The writer Katsuichiro Kamei famously criticized the fundamental Marxist outlook of the book which divided Japanese society into a war-mongering ruling class and heroic anti-war resisters while ignoring the wavering majority who did not fit neatly into either.Katsuichiro Kamei, “現代歴史家への疑問,” Bungeishunju, March 1956, 58-68. This dispute wound up involving many intellectuals including writers and historians and out of it the book Shōwa Shi Ronsō (\\"Controversies of Showa History\\") was developed. Fujiwara was a prolific researcher of the Nanking Massacre and took the standpoint that the scale of the massacre reached 200,000 victims. Tokushi Kasahara has deemed that his research made a detailed re-examination of the atrocity applying methods and theories of historical research against his own experience in the army fighting on the battlefield, and analyzing it in the context of Japan’s military history, making special reference to the historical idiosyncrasies of the Japanese army and the latent contempt and discriminatory attitudes of the Japanese people towards China which reinforced them.Tokushi Kasahara『南京事件論争史』 Heibonsha Shinsho、2007  Poison gas photograph scandal  On 31 October 1984 the morning edition of the Asahi Shimbun published over more than half of its front page a close-up black-and-white photograph of smoke like a wildfire or burning field billowing thickly with the headline of “Definitive photographic proof of poison gas use by the Japanese Imperial Army discovered”. Fujiwara Akira had deemed the photo to be of poison gas and he was introduced as “a historian and former army officer who is putting forward proof-positive research of chemical warfare in the Sino-Japanese War”. However, it was soon after questioned in a news report by the Sankei Shimbun whether it might be just a smoke screen, and later the same photograph was checked by volume 9 of the series Ketteiban Showa Shi (\\"Showa History: The Definitive Guide\\") published by Mainichi Shimbun in May 1984, and it was determined that there was nothing like poison gas in it. However, Asahi Shimbun was unapologetic and Fujiwara likewise did not once over the course of his life apologize or issue a correction.  Concerning the Korean War  The established theory on the Korean War is that the North Koreans advanced across the 38th parallel and the American army, though taken by surprise, managed to rally. However, in Shōwa Shi Fujiwara and his co-authors wrote, “On the 23rd American Air Force fighter units stationed in Japan massed at Kitakyushu. Then on the 25th the South Korean army began to advance across the 38th parallel on the pretext that North Korea had made an incursion.”Akira Fujiwara et al., 昭和史 (Tokyo: Iwanami Shinsho, 1955), 231. Fujiwara argued that South Korea was the aggressor and his writing strongly suggested that the US army was making preparations for the war. What’s more, though it was made clear in the memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev that the Korean War was an invasion by the North, Fujiwara held firm to his assertion that the Korean War started with South Korea’s “pre-emptive attack” up through the 1970s. Motohiko Izawa has criticized a number of modern historians like Fujiwara for putting ideology ahead of truth in their belief that the North Korean side was just and that American imperialism and the South Koreans were the villains.Motohiko Izawa 『逆説のニッポン歴史観』  Works  = Sole author = * 『軍事史』（東洋経済新報社、1961年） * 『日本帝国主義』（日本評論社、1968年） * 『天皇制と軍隊』（青木書店、1978年） * 『昭和の歴史（5）日中全面戦争』（小学館、1982年） * 『戦後史と日本軍国主義』（新日本出版社、1982年） * 『太平洋戦争史論』（青木書店、1982年） * 『南京大虐殺』（岩波書店［岩波ブックレット］、1985年） * 『日本軍事史』（日本評論社、1987年） * 『世界の中の日本』（小学館、1989年） * 『昭和天皇の15年戦争』（青木書店、1991年） * 『南京の日本軍――南京大虐殺とその背景』（大月書店、1997年） * 『餓死した英霊たち』（青木書店、2001年） * 『中国戦線従軍記』（大月書店、2002年） * 『日本軍事史［戦前篇・戦後篇］』（社会批評社、2007年） = As a co-author = * （遠山茂樹・今井清一）『昭和史』（岩波書店、1955年） * （遠山茂樹・今井清一）『日本近代史（全3巻）』（岩波書店、1975年-1977年） * （功刀俊洋・伊藤悟・吉田裕）『天皇の昭和史』（新日本出版社、1984年） * （荒川章二・林博史）『日本現代史――1945→1985』（大月書店、1986年） * （粟屋憲太郎・吉田裕・山田朗）『徹底検証・昭和天皇「独白録」』（大月書店、1991年） * （安斎育郎）『戦争から平和へ――21世紀の選択』（かもがわ出版、1994年） * （南京事件調査研究会）『南京大虐殺否定論13のウソ』（柏書房、 1999年）（著者は 井上久士、小野賢二、笠原十九司、藤原彰、吉田裕、本多勝一、渡辺春巳） = As an editor = * 『日本民衆の歴史（10）占領と民衆運動』（三省堂、1975年） * 『日本民衆の歴史（11）民衆の時代へ』（三省堂、1976年） * 『日本民衆の歴史（8）弾圧の嵐のなかで』（三省堂、1978年） * 『日本民衆の歴史（9）戦争と民衆』（三省堂、1978年） * 『体系日本現代史（6）冷戦下の日本』（日本評論社、1979年） * 『資料日本現代史（1）軍隊内の反戦運動』（大月書店、1980年） * 『ロシアと日本――日ソ歴史学シンポジウム』（彩流社、1985年） * 『沖縄戦と天皇制』（立風書房、1987年） * 『沖縄戦――国土が戦場になったとき』（青木書店、1987年） * 『南京事件をどうみるか――日・中・米研究者による検証』（青木書店、1998年） = As a co-editor = * （今井清一・大江志乃夫）『近代日本史の基礎知識――史実の正確な理解のために』（有斐閣、1972年） * （松尾尊兌）『論集現代史』（筑摩書房、1976年） * （野沢豊）『日本ファシズムと東アジア――現代史シンポジウム』（青木書店、1977年） * （功刀俊洋）『資料日本現代史（8）満洲事変と国民動員』（大月書店、1983年） * （雨宮昭一）『現代史と「国家秘密法」』（未來社、1985年） * （洞富雄・本多勝一）『南京事件を考える』（大月書店、1987年） * （今井清一）『十五年戦争史（全4巻）』（青木書店、 1988年-1989年） * （今井清一・宇野俊一・粟屋憲太郎）『日本近代史の虚像と実像（全4巻）』（大月書店、 1989年-1990年） * （荒井信一）『現代史における戦争責任――現代史シンポジウム』（青木書店、1990年） * （洞富雄・本多勝一）『南京大虐殺の研究』（晩聲社、1992年） * （粟屋憲太郎・吉田裕）『昭和20年/1945年――最新資料をもとに徹底検証する』（小学館、1995年） * （塩田庄兵衛・長谷川正安）『日本戦後史資料』（新日本出版社、1995年） * （小野賢二・本多勝一）『南京大虐殺を記録した皇軍兵士たち―第十三師団山田支隊兵士の陣中日記』（大月書店、1996年） * （森田俊男）『藤岡信勝氏の「歴史教育・平和教育」論批判』（大月書店、1996年） * （姫田光義）『日中戦争下中国における日本人の反戦活動』（青木書店、1999年） * （新井利男）『侵略の証言――中国における日本人戦犯自筆供述書』（岩波書店、1999年）  References  Hitotsubashi University faculty People from Tokyo 1922 births 2003 deaths Chiba University faculty University of Tokyo alumni 20th-century Japanese historians ","title":"Akira Fujiwara"},{"id":"36448530","text":"Whitman is an unincorporated community in Nelson County, North Dakota, United States.

It began with the establishment of the Malaysian Pilgrims Fund Board (Tabung Haji) and the country's first Islamic bank, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (BIMB), which began operations on 1 July 1983. Since then, BIMB has become the core component of Malaysia's Islamic financial system. With its initial objective confined to the development of a viable and modern alternative to meet financial needs, the Malaysian model is now one of the most advanced Islamic banking systems in the world. Objectives The ultimate goal of the Malaysian Islamic financial model is to operate in parallel with Malaysia's conventional financial system. To achieve this, the Islamic financial system presents itself as a viable alternative to the more established, conventional system. A specific legal framework and financial instruments are pre- requisites to the Islamic financial system. Initially, an Islamic Banking Act was enacted to cater for this system. As the system developed and new components within it were introduced, legal rules such as the Takaful Acts and rules governing the Islamic Interbank Money Market were issued. Because of the pressing need to kick start the expansion of the Islamic Banking system, the Central Bank (Bank Negara Malaysia - BNM) later allowed the conventional banking institutions to offer Islamic banking services using their infrastructure. The option was seen as the most effective and efficient mode of increasing the number of institutions offering Islamic banking services quickly and inexpensively. Following this, on 4 March 1993, BNM introduced \\"Skim Perbankan Tanpa Faedah\\" (Interest-free Banking Scheme), or SPTF, which became the “Skim Perbankan Islam - SPI” (Islamic Banking Scheme) in 1998. In October 1996, BNM issued a model financial statement for the banking institutions participating in the SPI, requiring them to disclose the Islamic banking operations (balance sheet and profit and loss account) as an additional item under the Notes to the Accounts. In harmonizing difference in opinion, the National Shariah Advisory Council, the highest deciding authority on Shariah issues pertaining to Islamic Financial System, was set up in 1997. Financial Sector Master Plan To prepare the domestic system for future challenges, BNM formulated the Financial Sector Master Plan (FSMP), a comprehensive ten year strategy to evolve a competitive, dynamic and resilient financial system that could withstand challenges caused by globalisation and liberation of the financial markets. The Islamic banking sector is recognized as one of the major potential growth sectors addressed in the FSMP. The Malaysian experience of Islamic Banking has had a tremendous impact on neighbouring countries and others across the globe. Islamic banking services in Malaysia have aided both Muslim and non-Muslim customers, and helped the country's economic development and national building process.

He was the son of Percival Rae and Ethalynd Maud Nix, and went to the Mico Practising School in Kingston. Rae's first cricket was played as a teenager in the Senior Cup for Kensington; he later played for Kingston. He played for Jamaica in 1925 in three matches against Barbados. In five innings, his highest score was 19 runs, but in the second game, he took four for 50 (four wickets for 50 runs) with the ball. The following year, Rae played three games for Jamaica against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team of English cricketers. He bowled less frequently than in 1925 but was more successful in batting, scoring 75 in the first match. In early 1927, he scored 98 and 84 in a series of games against an English touring team led by L. H. Tennyson, but barely bowled. His success in these games against English teams placed him in contention for a place on the West Indies tour of England taking place in 1928. Rae played in a series of trial matches in December 1927 and January 1928; in the final match, he scored 80. This performance, coupled with his previous form, secured his selection for the tour of England. Previews of the tour noted that Rae was an occasional wicket-keeper, a dependable fielder and capable of bowling leg theory. He was also described as someone who played big shots when batting. However, when Rae played in England, he bowled only five overs on the entire tour and played just seven first-class games. His highest score was 42 runs, and in total he made 74 runs at an average of 8.22. He did not play in any of the Test matches. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, reporting on the West Indies tour, said that Rae never \\"achieved anything of note\\". According to his obituary in the Daily Gleaner, his form in 1928 was affected by bronchitis. The remaining first-class cricket of Rae's career was played against English touring teams. Against Julien Cahn's team, he scored 121 for Jamaica in February 1929, his only first-class century. Later during the tour, he played for a West Indies team against Cahn's tourists and scored 64. The following year, he played for Jamaica against an MCC touring team and in 1932 he played against another team brought by Tennyson. Rae's final first-class games were in 1936 against Yorkshire County Cricket Club, which toured Jamaica in February and March. In one of these games, he scored 56, his last half- century in first-class cricket. He continued to be involved in the Kingston Cricket Club, and served as its president for many years, including at the time of his death. Rae was also a prominent businessman in Jamaica. After working briefly in theatre and cinema upon leaving school, by 1921 he was co- promoter at the Rae Brothers car dealership. In 1933, he became managing director of the firm for a year and held a similar position at Nash Motor Sales from 1939 to 1940. In addition, he was involved with the trade unions and local politics; he later joined several government committees. He was involved for several years on the government's water committee, acting as president in 1966. He was also a Justice of the Peace. Rae was married and had a daughter and a son, Allan, who later played Test cricket for West Indies in the 1950s. Rae was known as \\"Big Man\\" and had a reputation for being forceful, controversial and opinionated. Critics considered that he was not a naturally talented batsman, but improved through application and practice.

The water ride became so popular at AstroWorld that Six Flags debuted six new river rapids in the early 1980s, including Six Flags Over Georgia in 1982, and at Six Flags St. Louis in 1983.

Dewhurst (31 October 1894 – 4 January 1954) was a Trinidadian cricketer who played for West Indies before the team attained Test match status. A highly regarded wicket-keeper, Dewhurst was an influential and popular member of the Trinidad and West Indian sides. In his later career, he improved substantially as a batsman. He toured England with the West Indies team in 1923 but missed the 1928 tour of England in controversial circumstances. Despite continued speculation that he would be recalled, he did not play representative cricket again. Early career Dewhurst made his first-class debut for Trinidad in 1920, playing two matches against Barbados. The following season, he played twice in the Inter-Colonial Tournament, and also played both games in 1922. In the final of the latter tournament, he scored 58, his maiden first-class half-century and only his second score in double figures. During 1923, a representative West Indian team toured England. Dewhurst was selected as wicket-keeper for the tour. He played in 15 games to score 182 runs at an average of 10.11, with one half-century: 52 against Nottinghamshire. Although not the team's official vice-captain, Dewhurst was very influential in the side. His performances as wicket-keeper were widely praised in the English press, and according to one team-mate from that tour, the bowling was difficult for a wicket-keeper to take. Despite competition from C. Piggott, whom many Trinidadians considered a superior wicket-keeper, Dewhurst secured his place as Trinidad's wicket-keeper after the tour. Many critics regarded Dewhurst as the best wicket-keeper in the West Indies. Dewhurst continued to play for Trinidad between 1923 and 1926, although, owing to his business commitments, he was unable to play in every game. In 1926 he played against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was touring the West Indies, for both Trinidad and a West Indies team. He passed fifty three times against the touring team, and such was his improvement as a batsman that critics suggested he could hold a place in the West Indies team for his batting alone. However, Dewhurst did not play another first-class match until 1930. Controversy and later career Dewhurst occasionally captained Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament and was a candidate to captain the West Indies cricket team in England in 1928, when the two most likely men were unwilling or unable to lead the team. Dewhurst had acted as vice-captain of the West Indies team in 1926 to Harold Austin, but in the event, Karl Nunes was selected as captain. Dewhurst was also overlooked as vice-captain in favour of Vibart Wight although the latter had no captaincy experience.Article reprinted in Dewhurst was named in the team to tour England, but he withdrew. Some newspaper reports blamed illness for his decision, others suggested business reasons. Critics believed that Dewhurst's absence adversely affected the team; the replacement wicket-keepers were not regarded as equal to Dewhurst's ability, and the vice-captain had little success. It was suggested that Dewhurst only missed the tour because he had not been chosen as vice- captain. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted: \\"The absence of Dewhurst—a member of the team of 1923—was very severely felt.\\" However, Dewhurst was criticised in the West Indies for being unsporting by refusing to go on the tour. After an absence from first-class cricket, Dewhurst returned to play for Trinidad in 1930 when the MCC toured the West Indies. Before the series, he was named in the press as a candidate to lead the West Indies Test team. A Barbados newspaper claimed that he was the only suitable potential captain from Trinidad. The same report suggested that, while he may not have been available for every Test, he was an ideal leader if the selectors chose different captains for the matches played on each island.Quoted in During the tour, and before the Trinidad Test, the Trinidad team played the MCC. Nelson Betancourt captained in the first game and won the match; Dewhurst led in the second and was defeated. Subsequently, Betancourt was selected as captain for the Trinidad Test match. Citing \\"insularity and prejudice\\" in West Indian selection, an article in a Trinidad newspaper stated: \\"The selection of Betancourt in preference to Dewhurst was a pre-arranged affair, the latter being only given the leadership of the second Trinidad team in order to keep quiet a suspicious and already much chagrined public.\\"Quoted in The newspaper suggested that Dewhurst had been set up to fail when the selectors gave him a weaker team to play the MCC, that he still out-performed Betancourt in captaincy, and that the decision was based on factors other than ability. The match between Trinidad and MCC was Dewhurst's last in first-class cricket. In 31 first-class matches, he scored 665 runs at an average of 16.21, passing fifty in six innings. He held 47 catches and made 13 stumpings. Both the Trinidad and West Indian selectors continued to leave Dewhurst out of teams. He was not chosen to tour Australia with the West Indies in 1930–31. One press report suggested \\"reasons are to be found in directions other than cricket\\", and that minds had been \\"poisoned\\".Quoted in Dewhurst continued to be mentioned as a prospective selection, and even as a possibility for the West Indies captaincy, in the early 1930s, and critics still believed him to be the best wicket-keeper in the West Indies. But his lack of regular cricket was considered to count against him. Impact Writing about cricket in Trinidad, historian C. L. R. James noted that Dewhurst always kept wicket \\"excellently\\", but that many Trinidadians considered Piggott a better wicket-keeper who was only left out because he was black and Dewhurst was white. James recalled that people were astonished when Piggott was not chosen to tour England in 1923. But he suggests it was not a surprise as without Dewhurst's selection, among the Trinidad representatives on the West Indian team, there would have been no players from the Queen's Park Club, the most prestigious club on the island, nor would there have been any white players. Writing in 1927, in the expectation that Dewhurst would tour England the following year, his 1923 team-mate C. R. Browne wrote that Dewhurst's \\"heart is as big as his body\\" and that his \\"expansive smile captures many victims\\". He described him as \\"very unassuming, but winning in appearance Dewhurst is effective in his job and inspires confidence in bowler and fieldsmen alike. Without Trinidad's skipper no West Indies Team is complete.\\" References 1894 births 1954 deaths Pre-1928 West Indies cricketers Trinidad and Tobago cricketers ","title":"George Dewhurst (cricketer)"},{"id":"36448794","text":"NGC 2146 is a barred spiral galaxy type SB(s)ab pec in the constellation Camelopardalis.

She previously worked under Johnson as Deputy Mayor for Education and Culture when he was Mayor of London. Early life and education Mirza's family came to the United Kingdom from Pakistan; her father found work in a factory while her mother was a housewife and taught Urdu part-time. Mirza was born in Oldham, Greater Manchester, North West England and had two older brothers and an older sister. She went to Breeze Hill School until 16, then moved to Oldham Sixth Form College for her A-levels. She was the only pupil in her Sixth Form college to gain a place at Oxford University, studying English Literature at Mansfield College, graduating in 1999. She then completed an MA in Social Research in 2004 and a PhD in Sociology in 2009, both at the University of Kent.King’s People - Munira Mirza. King’s College London. Career Early on Mirza was involved in revolutionary politics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/15/munira- mirza-pms-nonsense-detector-who-has-attacked-racism-claims including being a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, a small group that dissolved in 1997. She contributed to its magazine, Living Marxism, which was dissolved after losing a libel case to ITN over the Bosnian genocide. The magazine was replaced by the Spiked website, for which she has written articles. Many of Mirza's Revolutionary Communist Party colleagues became influential in Conservative Party Eurosceptic circles after the dissolution of their party, while remaining closely associated with each other's endeavours. Mirza has said that \\"I became a bit of a 'museums junkie' in my early twenties. My first job in the arts sector was at the Royal Society of Arts, where I became especially interested in the politics of culture – why we value what we do, how to make the arts more accessible, and why public interest in the arts matters. From there, I started a PhD in Sociology, looking particularly at the politics of culture.\\" She worked briefly at the Tate Gallery. During 2005-2007 Mirza worked as Development Director for the conservative think-tank Policy Exchange. While she was there she edited a collection of essays, Culture Vultures: Is UK Arts Policy Damaging the Arts?, which challenged the government's efforts to promote socially inclusive arts. and wrote Living Apart Together: British Muslims and the Paradox of Multiculturalism. In December 2009, she appeared in the BBC Radio 4 programme Great Lives, nominating the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. From 2008 to 2016, Mirza worked for the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, initially as Cultural Adviser, and Director of Arts, Culture and the Creative Industries. From 2012, she was one of six Deputy Mayors, being Deputy Mayor for Education and Culture. She advised the Mayor on priorities for culture and education and led the delivery of key programmes, including £40m education and youth investment in London. In 2014, Mirza said that she was not a Conservative. Her book The Politics of Culture: The Case for Universalism was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2012. In it she argued that consensus about the value of cultural diversity had bred ambivalence. In 2016, Mirza was a vocal advocate of Brexit, a stance which, in cultural circles, she later described as \\"the new being gay\\". She said the referendum result was achieved through a process of democracy that, in some way, echoed Magna Carta, and that a copy of this should be sent to the EU. In 2018, Mirza was mentioned by the New Statesman as a possible Conservative Party candidate for the 2020 London Mayoral election. In January 2019, she joined King's College London as Executive Director of Culture, leading the institution's cultural strategy together with oversight of the Science Gallery London at Guy's Campus. On 24 July 2019, following her former boss Johnson becoming Prime Minister, Mirza was appointed Director of the Number 10 Policy Unit, replacing James Marshall. Mirza has drafted policy including financial policy. Johnson has spoken of her as \\"extraordinary\\", \\"ruthless\\", and one of \\"the five women who have shaped my life\\". =Arts involvements= Mirza is a member of Arts Council England, London Area Council; and the board of the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Mirza has a record of advocating for public investment in the arts, but has also warned that organisations will need to become \\"more entrepreneurial and look for ways to stretch their resources\\", including through corporate sponsorship. =Views on multiculturalism and racism= In 2006 Mirza was critical of the multiculturalism encouraged by New Labour claiming that it accentuated differences between groups, encouraging conflict and that treating people differently \\"fuels a sense of exclusion\\". Mirza stands firmly against the anti-racism movement, describing it as \\"bogus moral crusade\\" imported from the USA, \\"...with its demented campus dramas and neuroses about ‘safe spaces’, ‘micro-aggressions’ and ‘cultural appropriation’\\". She has attracted criticism for saying that \\"it seems that a lot of people in politics think it's a good idea to exaggerate the problem of racism\\", and Theresa May's proposed racial disparities audit for public services set the scene for \\"another bout of political self-flagellation regarding the subject of race in Britain\\", and that \\"accusations of institutional racism — and their official endorsement — have corroded BAME communities' trust in public services, thereby making things worse.\\" As well as calling May's racial disparities audit a \\"phoney race war\\", Mirza also described The Lammy Review of 2017 into the treatment of BAME groups in the justice system as \\"wrongheaded\\" and \\"misleading\\". On Boris Johnson's column criticising Denmark for banning the burqa, while likening the garment to 'bank robbers' and 'letterboxes', she said \\"there are many people in this country who are uncomfortable about the burqa. When people argue we should use more sensitive language what they are really saying is let's not be critical at all, let's not offend, let's not criticise this practice because it upsets Muslims\\", further defending Johnson's comments as \\"reasoned, balanced and thoughtful\\". Regarding the Windrush scandal, Mirza claimed that \\"the real lesson is not one of racism, as in the deliberate targeting of ethnic minority groups, rather it is that the process of immigration enforcement needs to be improved\\". In June 2020, following the George Floyd protests, Mirza was asked to establish a commission on racial inequalities.

He served as a Finance Minister of Cyprus under president Glafcos Clerides from 19 March 1999 until 28 February 2003. Education Takis Klerides was born in Nicosia, Cyprus, in 1951. He earned his Business studies degree in England and then qualified as a member of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) in England, having completed the examinations in 1974. He is now a Fellow of ACCA and a member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus (ICPA). Career After graduation Kleridis worked for a few years in England and Greece. He returned to Cyprus to join Metaxas Loizides Syrimis & Co (later KPMG Cyprus), Accountants, Auditors, Consultants, where he became a partner in 1981. He left KPMG in March 1999 when he was appointed Minister of Finance of the Republic of Cyprus, a post he held until February 2003. European Union In his speech to the House of Representatives in November 2002, Klerides outlined that during 2001 and 2002 the Economy of Cyprus faced an adverse external environment. Nevertheless, as the Minister pointed out, the Government set specific strategic goals and succeeded in achieving them. These include the positive record in macroeconomic stability, manifested in the low inflation rate and the containment of the fiscal deficit below 3% of GDP, thus fulfilling the corresponding Maastricht Treaty criterion, the improvement of the standard of living, the enhancement of competitiveness and the modernisation of the public sector. Cyprus Stock Market Bubble The 1999–2000 Cyprus Stock Exchange bubble took place while Klerides was serving as finance minister. There have been several calls in the Cypriot media for tighter regulation to prevent Financial crimes and white collar crime as investigating authorities attempted to get at the root cause, in which investors lost millions as the result of artificially inflated share prices. In a report released in 2002 by local newspaper Cyprus Weekly, it praised the activities of the Watchdog Committee of the House of Representatives, which investigated the causes of the bubble and called for tighter supervision of auditors, increased powers for regulators and greater public education to ensure that such a situation does not arise again. Likening the 2000 crisis to the aftermath of the collapse of Enron, the newspaper called for new standards to ensure the independence of auditors from CSE activities. The report also called for an increase in the investigative powers of the Cyprus SEC (CySEC).

He attended private schools in Warsaw and graduated from the classical gymnasium in Łomża in 1893, after which he entered the Imperial University of Warsaw in the Division of Mathematics and Physics. At the time, Russian was the language of instruction at the university, as Warsaw was under Russian rule. He was expelled from the university for participation in patriotic (anti-Russian) demonstrations in 1894. He moved to Lwów Polytechnic School, where he obtained a so-called half-diploma in 1897. Desiring to continue his mathematical education, he moved to Leipzig, where he worked under Sophus Lie. His doctoral thesis, published in 1898, was titled Beiträge zu der Theorie der Iterationsrechnung. Böttcher married Maria Wolle in 1900, and had four children. Career Following his doctorate, Böttcher returned to Lwów to take up a junior position at the Lwów Polytechnic School. By 1911, he was licensed to teach (venia legendi) at the school, and he offered courses on theoretical mechanics as well as mathematics for engineering. All his attempts to obtain habilitation at the University of Lwów failed, however. This meant that he was not permitted to guide doctoral students. Böttcher was a member of the Polish Mathematical Society. He took seriously his role of an educator, encouraging the introduction of differential and integral calculus at school level, and writing several high-school textbooks. One example is Principles of Elementary Algebra, adapted to the curriculum in the Polish Kingdom (1911), which followed the so-called Meran programme that aimed to teach students to think in terms of functions. =Main works= Böttcher's most important work was in the iterations of rational mappings of the Riemann sphere. His name is attached to Böttcher theorem, in which he introduced Böttcher's equation and solved it under certain assumptions. He obtained results about the orbits of iterated rational maps, studied their convergence regions (Fatou components) and boundaries (Julia set); he also gave examples of everywhere chaotic maps constructed via elliptic functions. Indeed, his example of rational maps whose chaotic set is the entire sphere predated the more famous Lattès examples by over twenty years. =Academic reception= Böttcher was one of the founders of Holomorphic dynamics, which he viewed as a part of the mathematical theory of iterational calculus. Despite his achievements, however, his early publications were considered insufficient to warrant a habilitation at the University of Lwow in 1901. Seventeen years later, with more publications to his name, he approached the University again for habilitation, but his request was denied. The committee's criticism focused on erroneous and unscientific reasoning in some of his papers, and cited the lack of clarity even in his expository works. As Böttcher worked in a mathematical discipline considerably removed from the interests of other Lwów mathematicians, he found little support from his peers. Indeed, his partial results and conclusions were forgotten, and a complete theory came about only decades later following the independent investigations of Pierre Fatou, Gaston Julia, Samuel Lattès and Salvatore Pincherle. Later life Böttcher retired from the Polytechnic School in 1935. He died in Lwów on May 29, 1937.

It is an uncommon but widespread species, having been reported from Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. The fruit body (mushroom) begins developing in a thin, egg-like sac. This ruptures and the stem expands quickly, leaving the sac at the base of the stem as a volva. The cap, which can attain a diameter of up to , is white to slightly yellowish and covered with silky hairs. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced gills, free from attachment to the stem, and initially white before turning pink as the spores mature. The mushroom grows singly or in clusters, often appearing in old knotholes and wounds in elms and maples. V. bombycina contains compounds with antibacterial properties.  Taxonomy  The species was first described in 1774 by German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer as Agaricus bombycinus. Throughout its taxonomical history, it has been shuffled to several genera, including Pluteus (by Elias Fries in 1836), Volvaria (Paul Kummer, 1871), and Volvariopsis (William Alphonso Murrill, 1911). Rolf Singer placed it in its current genus, Volvariella, in 1951. Other names that have been applied to the species include Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Amanita calyptrata and August Johann Georg Karl Batsch's Agaricus denudatus (both published in 1783), but these are illegitimate names as Schäffer's earlier 1774 name has priority. In 1949, Murrill described the variety flaviceps from collections made growing on magnolia wood in Gainesville, Florida. Although he originally described it as a new species, Volvaria flaviceps, Robert Shaffer considered it a variety of V. bombycina. Variety microspora was first described in 1953, was later (1961) named by R.W.G. Dennis; variety palmicola was originally described as a distinct species Volvaria palmicola by Belgian mycologist Maurice Beely in 1928, and later as a variety of V. bombycina by the same author in 1937. The root for the generic name Volvariella (as well as Volvaria and Volvariopsis, genera in which the species had been formerly placed) derives from the Latin volva, meaning \\"wrapper\\" or \\"a covering\\". The specific epithet bombycina derives from the Latin root bombyc, or \\"silky\\". Common names for the mushroom include the \\"silky sheath\\", the \\"silky rosegill\\", the \\"silver-silk straw mushroom\\", or the \\"tree mushroom\\".  Description  The fruit bodies of Volvariella bombycina are initially egg-shaped when still enclosed in the universal veil. As they expand, the caps later becoming bell-shaped or convex, and finally nearly flattened in age, attaining a diameter of . The dry cap surface is covered with silky threads. Its color is white to yellowish, becoming more pale approaching the margin. The flesh is thin, soft, and white, and has an odor, resembling raw potatoes. Gills are crowded close together, free from attachment to the stem, and initially white before turning pinkish as the spores mature. The stem measures long by thick, and is typically tapered upward or thickened below. It is white, with a smooth surface, and is often slightly curved. The universal veil is membranous, often areolate (cracked into irregularly shaped blocks) or scaly, and forms a long, saclike volva that wraps around the base of the stem. It is white to yellowish or dingy brown, and often divided into lobes. The variety flaviceps has a yellow cap. The variety V. bombycina var. flaviceps is distinguished from the main form by its smaller, bright yellow caps, up to in diameter, and its dirty-white, scaly volva. Murrill also noted that it developed a \\"peculiar sickening odor during drying\\". V. bombycina var. microspora has smaller spores (6–7.5 by 4–5 μm), a yellow cap, and a blotched brown volva. V. bombycina var. palmicola also has a yellow cap and small spores (5.9–7.5 by 4.3–5.4 μm), but can be distinguished from the previous varieties by its distantly spaced gills. Mushrooms produce a spore print with a color ranging from pinkish to salmon. Spores are elliptical, smooth, and measure 6.5–10 by 4.5–6.5 μm. The basidia (spore- bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 19–43 by 6–11 μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia that occur on the gill face) are usually spindle shaped, but have a widely variable morphology; they are abundant in the hymenium, and have dimensions of 26–122 by 8–57 μm. The cheilocystidia (on the gill edge) are similar in morphology and abundance, some may feature knobs held at the end of slender projections up to 20 μm long; dimensions are in the range of 26 and 144 μm long by 8–46 μm wide. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of V. bombycina. The fruit bodies can be readily grown in laboratory culture. = Similar species = The combination of a silky white cap, white stem, pink gills, pink spore print, and growth on wood is characteristic of this species and make identification of Volvariella bombycina in the field relatively easy. Some Pluteus species have a general similar appearance, and also produce pinkish to pinkish-brown spore prints, but they lack a volva. Amanita species grow on the ground and make white spore prints. V. pusilla has a small cap measuring in diameter with silky fibers and short lines visible at the cap edge when moist; it grows in soil in gardens and greenhouses and on lawns. V. hypopithys has a medium-size white cap that is in diameter with silky to scaly fibers and lacks the short lines at the cap edge when moist; it grows on the ground in woods. V. caesiotincta has a bluish-gray cap, while V. gloiocephala can be distinguished from V. bombycina by its smooth cap that is sticky when damp, and a white volva. = Edibility = The fruit bodies are edible, and usually considered of good quality. They have been called \\"excellent\\", \\"tasty\\" with a \\"modest and pleasant flavor\\", and \\"worth eating if found in large enough quantities\\". Alexander H. Smith related a story of how unique circumstances led to the development of a local superstition about the species: > ... the members of a family here in Ann Arbor were poisoned, some fatally, > as the result of eating caps of a species of Amanita. The next year Volvaria > bombycina fruited on a maple tree at the home of these people, and the story > was circulated that some of the spores of the poisonous fungus, which caused > the deaths the year before, had escaped from the house, lodged in the tree, > germinated, grew and were now producing fruiting bodies. Consequently the > carpophores of the Volvaria were held in great awe by the neighbors, and > soon came to be referred to as the \\"ghost mushroom\\". No one, of course, > would consider eating them.  Habitat and distribution  Fruit bodies often grow in knotholes or clefts of trees; shown here on sugar maple. Volvariella bombycina is a saprobic species. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods. Favored species include sugar maple, red maple, silver maple, magnolia, mango, beech, oak, and elm. It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks. It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years. Despite its preference for hardwoods, it has been reported growing on rare instances on coniferous wood. An uncommon species with a wide distribution, it has been reported from Asia (China, India, Korea, Pakistan), the Caribbean (Cuba), Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005, making it a legal offense to pick it. Variety microspora is known from Venezuela, while V. bombycina var. palmicola occurs in the DR Congo.  Bioactive compounds  Several bioactive secondary metabolites have been isolated and identified from Volvariella bombycina fruit bodies, mycelium, or pure culture. The compounds ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraene-3-one, ergosterol peroxide, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, and indazole were found in liquid culture. In 2009, the novel compound isodeoxyhelicobasidin was identified from culture broth; this compound inhibits the enzyme human elastase. The fungus also produces compounds that have antioxidative activity.

Set in Venice under the fascist regime in the early months of 1940, it recounts a tale of a voluptuous woman in her forties who is unable to respond to her husband but undergoes a belated sexual awakening with her daughter's fiancé, which enables her to please her husband at last. The film caused scandal in some quarters because it contains several explicit shots of nudity (characterised by certain critics as \\"gynecological\\") and sex scenes involving the well-known actress Stefania Sandrelli. However, the film ultimately obtained a decent level of commercial success. Plot Desperate after 20 years of marriage at his inability to arouse his beautiful but inhibited wife Teresa, retired art teacher Nino Rolfe records his love for her and his frustration in a diary that he locks in his desk, leaving the key for her to find. When she passes out after a party, he undresses her and their daughter's fiancé Laszlo administers an injection. Laszlo, who surreptitiously fondled her exposed buttock during the injection, is also seized with desire for Teresa. Nino starts taking secret photographs of Teresa asleep but the only person he can find to develop them is Laszlo, who starts a steamy affair with Teresa. His fiancée Lisa reproaches her mother but remains complicit by not breaking off with Laszlo, who also begins taking provocative pictures of Teresa. In addition, Teresa starts keeping a diary of her feelings, which she makes sure Nino can find. So a web of guilty relationships is formed, recorded in supposedly secret diaries and photographs. It ends when Teresa, liberated by her wild cavortings with Laszlo, feels able to give pleasure to Nino as well. The effort gives him a stroke, and the story ends with his funeral, held on the day Italy enters the war. Production The Key is based on Kagi by Tanizaki Junichiro. The book had been previously adapted to film by Kon Ichikawa in Odd Obsession. Brass' film relocates the story to Mussolini's time and changes the setting to Venice.  Cast  * Stefania Sandrelli: Teresa Rolfe * Frank Finlay: Nino Rolfe * Barbara Cupisti: Lisa Rolfe * Franco Branciaroli: Laszlo Apony * Ricky Tognazzi: a student * Ugo Tognazzi: a drunk Reception From a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin found that \\"Despite its solid production values, The Key has a reassuringly uninflated approach to its material\\" and that the film \\"is a much more creative use of genre than many more 'respectable' commercial attempts.\\" In a retrospective review, Sight & Sound stated that \\"Brass makes no apology for underlining a personal preference (common to the pornography enjoyed by his generation) for frequent displays of stockings and suspenders, wispy pubic hair and above all the female posterior\\" while stating that \\"visually the film plays rewarding games with reflections and colours. But the political ambience is weakly conveyed in comparison with Bertolucci's The Conformist (1970), with which The Key shares its period, Sandrelli and producer Giovanni Bertolucci.\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1983 References External links * Italian films Italian erotic drama films Films directed by Tinto Brass Films set in Venice Films set in 1940 1980s erotic drama films Films scored by Ennio Morricone Films based on Japanese novels Films based on works by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki Adultery in films Italian remakes of foreign films ","title":"The Key (1983 film)"},{"id":"36449189","text":"George Cory in the uniform of St Andrew's College Cadet Corps Sir George Edward Cory (3 June 1862 in Stoke Newington - 28 April 1935 in Cape Town), was an English-born South African chemist and historian, best known for his six- volume publication \\"The Rise of South Africa\\". Early life The son of George Nicholas Cory, George was apprenticed at age twelve to an ivory turner. He was privately tutored and later attended St. John's College at Hurstpierpoint. At the age of 23 he was employed as assistant telegraph engineer at Siemens Brothers in Woolwich. In 1881, together with Cameron Swan, son of the inventor Joseph Swan, he installed the first electric light in London in the Savoy Theatre. In 1886, he was admitted to the University of Cambridge as a non-collegiate student, graduating with a BA in 1888, taking honours in the Natural Sciences Tripos, becoming a member of King's College and appointed a demonstrator in chemistry while studying medicine in his spare time.  Work in Grahamstown  He was awarded an MA degree in 1891 and emigrated to South Africa in the same year, taking up the position of vice- principal at the Grahamstown Public School . He soon went on to become government lecturer in physics and chemistry at St. Andrew's College in 1894. Here he founded the chemical laboratory, financed by Barney Barnato and other sponsors. On the establishing of Rhodes University College in 1904, Cory took up the post of Professor of Chemistry, a position he held until 1925 when he retired. After his arrival in Grahamstown, Cory found a new interest in the history of the Eastern Province, perhaps sparked by his home in Grahamstown having formerly been the Drostdy, the residence of the Landdrost or magistrate. He wasted little time in developing an intellectual circle of friends – \\"Some time in 1892 or thereabouts, some of us—Meredith, Rev G W Cross, Adv. Lardner-Burke, Webb of St. Andrew's, all now dead—and myself started a Society called the \\"Athenaeum\\". Cory started tracking down and questioning old Bantu chiefs and any survivors of the 1820 Settlers. During his spare time he travelled on foot and covered large areas of the Eastern Cape, amassing an enormous amount of historical data. The magistrate's office in Grahamstown had preserved a large number of letters, bound in volumes, and pertaining to public matters – material giving useful insight into life in the 1800s. The perusal, copying and summarising of these records was tackled by Cory over a number of years. At that time Leander Starr Jameson was prime minister of the Cape Colony and with a bequest made by Alfred Beit, arranged to assist Cory in his investigations, provided that some publication would result. Thus the first volume of The Rise of South Africa appeared in 1910. The success of this volume was such that the Rhodes Trustees sponsored further work and accordingly volumes 2 and 3 were published in 1913 and 1919, volume 4 in 1926 and volume 5 in 1930. Cambridge honoured Cory with a Doctor of Letters in 1921, and the following year he received a knighthood. Volume 6 of his work appeared posthumously in the Archives Year Book for 1939. Some time in 1915 Cory wrote and published, in a small print run, a paper entitled \\"A short history of slavery at the Cape.”  Personal life  Lady Cory, née Gertrude Blades The Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint George, Grahmstown George Cory married Gertrude Blades of Northwich in 1895, and they raised 5 children – Dulcibel Mowbray 1 November 1899, Sutu Alfrida 26 August 1902, John Hugh Mountain 12 July 1905, Robert Rhodes 24 June 1908, and Margaret Patricia Gertrude 28 July 1910. Dulcibel Mowbray became a botany teacher and plant collector, marrying Paul Ribbink, the Librarian of Parliament in 1932, and settling in Cape Town. She corresponded with the botanists Rudolf Marloth and Selmar Schonland. Cory had a passion for church music and was a regular chorister at the Grahamstown Cathedral. He was known to be affable and a great conversationalist with a host of friends. Notwithstanding his academic duties he found time to serve on the Grahamstown City Council for two years and was a member of other public bodies. He was instrumental in the organising of Grahamstown's centenary celebrations in 1912 and promoted the 1820 Settlers' centenary in 1921. His knowledge of the Settlers and his lantern slide lectures made him a sought-after speaker on the subject. His famous slide collection is curated by the Cory Library for Humanities Research, at Rhodes University.  Work as an historian  Visiting London in 1922 he came across the diary of the Rev. Francis Owen in the archives of the Church Missionary Society. Owen had been an eye-witness to the murder of Piet Retief and his party by Dingaan in 1838. Cory persuaded the Society to donate the diary to South Africa, and published an edited version in a Van Riebeeck Society memoir of 1926. He presided over the first dinner of the Rhodes University College alumni in London, at which occasion he was told that his portrait was to be painted by John Henry Amshewitz. When Cory retired in 1925, he settled in Cape Town and spent his final years working in the Government Archives, having been appointed honorary archivist and historiographer. The Royal Empire Society awarded him a gold medal in 1933 for his historical work. The Cory Library for Historical Research was started in 1931 when Cory donated his collection of books, letters, pamphlets, manuscripts, maps, journals, newspapers and photographs, to the Rhodes University College Library. Cory, and George McCall Theal, have been branded as \\"settler\\" historians, although their goal was never to glorify settler history, and the pair have been undeservedly relegated to obscurity by some historians, notably Christopher Saunders and William Miller Macmillan. Even though his methods were meticulous and groundbreaking, Cory was rankled by the 'amateur' label affixed to him by professional historians. He was a pioneer in his use of \\"conversations\\" for gathering information. Previously, documentation was the only accepted medium considered reliable by others working in the same field. Cory also placed the issue of slavery squarely on the national historical agenda with his 1915 essay \\"Slavery at the Cape of Good Hope\\".

Formed in March 1942 at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, its prime function initially was the assembly and despatch of combat aircraft from the United States; it also performed salvage operations. From 1942 until 1947 it took on the role of administering the Amberley base. The depot was responsible for heavy maintenance of the RAAF's English Electric Canberra jet bombers following their entry into service in 1953. In the 1970s it began maintaining and upgrading the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, along with Bell UH-1 Iroquois and Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters. No. 3 AD merged with No. 482 Maintenance Squadron in March 1992 to form No. 501 Wing, which maintained the F-111 until disbanding in 2001. History =World War II= alt=Three men servicing a single-engined military aircraft No. 3 Aircraft Depot (No. 3 AD) was formed at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, on 16 March 1942. It came under the control of No. 5 (Maintenance) Group.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, p. 175 The depot's first, temporary, commanding officer was Squadron Leader W.H. Nicholson. On establishment, No. 3 AD's main purpose was the assembly and despatch of combat aircraft manufactured in the United States. In its first six weeks of operation, it assembled 123 Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters and a dozen Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The depot was also responsible for the inspection of RAAF CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons. A further role was salvaging damaged aircraft from units in the local area, and despatching them to No. 5 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Wagga, New South Wales, for repair. Wing Commander (later Group Captain) G.E. Douglas, previously in charge of No. 1 Aircraft Depot at Laverton, Victoria, assumed command of No. 3 AD in June 1942. Station Headquarters Amberley was dissolved on 1 July, and the depot took over the role of command and control of the base.RAAF Historical Section, Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations, pp. 119–123 As the war progressed, Amberley became one of Australia's largest aircraft maintenance facilities, as well as a way station for United States Army Air Forces personnel and equipment bound for operations in the South West Pacific. In addition to Airacobras and Marauders, among the aircraft types No. 3 AD assembled during World War II were Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks, Republic P-43 Lancers, Vultee A-31 Vengeances, Supermarine Spitfires, Grumman F6F Hellcats, and North American P-51 Mustangs. =Post-war years= No. 82 (Heavy Bomber) Wing and its three squadrons of Consolidated B-24 Liberators arrived at Amberley as lodger units between February and April 1946. In the aftermath of World War II, No. 3 AD continued to command and administer the base until the re-establishment of Station Headquarters Amberley in 1947. No. 82 Wing converted to Avro Lincolns during 1948.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111, p. 48 In October 1952, when Lincolns flew observation flights as part of Operation Hurricane, the first British atomic test in Australia, No. 3 AD was responsible for handling underwing canisters used to collect radioactive particles.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111, pp. 55–56 The RAAF's first jet bomber, the English Electric Canberra, began replacing the Lincoln in December 1953.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111, p. 104 No. 3 AD was responsible for \\"deep\\" maintenance of the Canberra, which involved stripping aircraft back to their components. This process was generally required every five years, and could take up to a year to complete. The depot also performed deep maintenance on the CAC Sabre fighter during its service with the RAAF.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 176 No. 3 AD's crest was approved by Queen Elizabeth II in June 1959; the design featured a Maltese cross in azure, symbolising the unit's home state of Queensland, surmounted by a cock's head in gold with a red comb. From December 1966 until January 1969, No. 3 AD was commanded by Group Captain James Rowland, later Chief of the Air Staff and Governor of New South Wales. By the 1970s, the depot was responsible for maintenance of the RAAF's Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters as well as the Canberra bombers. It also maintained the McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms leased to the RAAF from 1970 to 1973 as an interim strike force pending delivery of the long-delayed General Dynamics F-111C.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 386–388Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 115 alt=Camouflaged swing-wing military aircraft in flight The F-111C represented the most significant maintenance challenge undertaken by the RAAF, and No. 3 AD's hangars and workshops were extensively revamped before and after the new bomber's entry into service in mid-1973.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 177–178Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 41, 111–112 The depot was responsible for major upgrades and complex maintenance involving stripping down the airframe and engines, while intermediate-level servicing was carried out by No. 482 (Maintenance) Squadron, a unit of No. 82 Wing.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111, p. 160RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, pp. 66–69 After General Dynamics in Fort Worth, Texas, had modified the first of four F-111Cs earmarked to be brought up to RF-111C standard for photographic reconnaissance, No. 3 AD modified the remaining three aircraft at Amberley during 1980. In 1982–83, the depot upgraded to C-model standard four F-111As delivered to replace the four F-111Cs from the RAAF's original order that had been lost through accidents.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 162 It conducted the F-111 Pave Tack infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system upgrade in 1985.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 164–167 No. 3 AD also took on responsibility for maintenance of Boeing CH-47 Chinooks after the helicopters entered service with No. 12 Squadron, based at Amberley, in September 1973. The depot had no familiarity dealing with significant damage to the Chinook, and when one of the helicopters crashed following an engine failure in 1975 the repairs were not completed until 1981. From the 1980s, No. 3 AD's organisation included a maintenance management squadron made up of individual flights responsible for the upkeep of equipment, engines, and airframes, the last-mentioned including armament and de-seal/re-seal. The process for de-sealing and re-sealing the F-111s fuel tanks, which the depot first undertook between 1977 and 1982 and which lasted six months per aircraft, caused controversy owing to the hazardous working conditions for ground crews. Brain damage to personnel caused by chemical exposure resulted in a class action that cost the Australian government more than A$20 million in damages.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 206–208 On 16 March 1992, No. 3 AD merged with No. 482 Squadron to form No. 501 Wing, which became the largest unit in the RAAF, comprising over 1,200 personnel.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 196 The depot completed its disbandment on 30 June that year.

Statoblasts are masses of cells that function as \\"survival pods\\" rather like the gemmules of sponges. Statoblasts form on the funiculus (cord) connected to the parent's gut, which nourishes them. As they grow, statoblasts develop protective bivalve-like shells made of chitin. When they mature, some types stick to the parent colony, some fall to the bottom, some contain air spaces that enable them to float, and some remain in the parent's cystid (outer casing) to re-build the colony if it dies. Statoblasts can remain dormant for considerable periods, and while dormant can survive harsh conditions such as freezing and desiccation. They can be transported across long distances by animals, floating vegetation, currents and winds. When conditions improve, the valves of the shell separate and the cells inside develop into a zooid that tries to form a new colony. A study estimated that one group of colonies in a patch produced 800,000 statoblasts.

Reception Initial critical reception for the book has been positive, with a reviewer for the Irish Independent writing that \\"To say that this is a departure for the Wexford novelist is an understatement, but it can hardly fail to be a major talking point when it's published in October.\\" The Huffington Post also commented favourably on Tóibín's attempts to humanise Mary, saying: \\"The Testament of Mary is a reminder that Jesus indeed had a mother, and she was nobody's fool.\\" It was on the shortlist for the 2013 Man Booker Prize.

Biography John Edgerley was born about 1814, probably in Upper Arley, then Staffordshire England and worked as a gardener at Arley Hall. He migrated to New Zealand in 1834 on the sailing ship Emma Eugenia ex the Downs, arrived en route at Sydney 10 May 1835 and reached the Hokianga 30 July. He spent the years to 1841 at Horeke in the Hokianga as gardener/botanist for Lieutenant Thomas McDonnell, who had been appointed an additional British Resident in New Zealand - they had travelled out together. He brought plants with him from England and when Edward Wakefield visited Horeke in 1839 he found a flourishing garden. There are records in England of John Edgerley sending plant specimens and live plants to Kew Gardens, Mr. A. B. Lambert and the Earl of Mountnorris. Auckland Museum has 8 letters written by John Edgerley to A B Lambert, J. Smith (curator at Kew) and Sir William Hooker concerned with the collecting of New Zealand plants for English collections, including “the royal gardens”. Subsequently, Edgerley returned to England with both live and dried plants and was at Arley Hall again in April 1842. When John Edgerley sailed for England in 1842 he had taken back a collection of New Zealand plants for Kew Gardens. In return the director of Kew, Sir William Hooker, undertook to provide him with a wide range of flowering shrubs (six casefuls) for setting up his nursery on this land in Epsom. Edgerley requested the following plants: “Rhododendrons, camellias, arbutus or strawberry tree, laurustine, Portugal laurel, common laurel, azaleas, a plant or two of lilac, wisteria sinensis, tree paeonia, with a few plants of fuchsias – corymbiflora if you can spare it, ribes sanguinea, magnolia grandiflora, deutzia scabra, box for hedging, with a few good roses, white moss if you can spare it, ajuga japonica, cedar of Lebanon, jasminum…acorns, chestnuts, hawthorn berries or any other seed you thought would germinate, also a small collection of good flower seeds with fir cones” . Although roses, flowering seeds and annuals had been imported by early missionaries, their planting concentrated on practical plants such as fruit trees, shelter trees and crops. Certainly this was the first importation of rhododendrums, camellias, azaleas, lilac and wisteria into New Zealand . He married Sarah Newnham at Upper Arley on 27, December, 1842 and they travelled on the Tyne arriving at Hobart August 1843 then coming on to Auckland. It was possible that he leased some land immediately in the Epsom/Newmarket area as in the police census of 1844, he was living in a raupo hut in that location. John Edgerley brought a collection of items out with him including a set of blasting tools, candle snuffers, a tinder box and a humane man trap, these items are now in the Auckland War Memorial Museum. A New Zealand Crown Grant, of land in the area now called Epsom, dated 21 December 1844 for 6 acres 2 roods was issued to John Kelly and Frederick Whitaker. This land was transferred to John Edgerley on 15 December 1851. On 10 June 1848 John Edgerley obtained a crown grant of 5 acres adjoining this Kelly/Whitaker grant. At the land in Epsom, including the land now known as 74 and 66 Gillies Ave, he established a nursery which he worked till he died in 1849 at 35 years. By May 1846 he was advertising a large variety of fruit trees for sale, including a dozen varieties of apples at “Eden Nursery”. By 1848 he was advertising twenty four types of apple trees, six types of plum trees, twenty four types of cherry trees, four types of pear trees, five types of peach trees, seven types of nectarines and three types of apricot trees as well as a variety of other plants. Two uncommon New Zealand shrubs bear Edgerley's name. Pomaderris prunifolia Fenzl var edgerleyi and Pseudopanax edgerleyi. Edgerley served as a judge at the first Agricultural and Horticultural Show, held on 18 December 1843 at Mr Hart's Exchange hotel. Edgerley's granddaughter was Kate Edgerley, botanist and teacher. Family John and Sarah had two boys, John born 26 July 1846 and William born 4 April 1848. A daughter Sarah was born in 1850. In 1852 Sarah Edgerley sold the fruit trees, put cows on the 11 acres and ran a milk supply. John Edgerley's son, John, was one of the first white people born in Auckland in 1846. According to his own record he was born in the raupo hut on the land at Epsom. He was apprenticed to the building trade, serving in the Remuera and Parnell Volunteers during the land wars, then moved to the Thames gold fields, Fiji and Melbourne. In Fiji he built houses for Missionaries and ran a cotton plantation. He returned in to Epsom in the 1860s and in the early 1880s he went into partnership with his brother William, settling on the land at Epsom and running a building business. Around this time the brothers built a return villa on a high point of their property, incorporating John Edgerley's 1849 house according to family lore and Dinah Holman in “Newmarket lost and found”. John's wife Sarah died in June 1895 aged 83. 1895 the Edgerley brother were conspicuous attenders at the annual meetings of Epsom ratepayers, usually held in William Edgerley's workshop. John Edgerley was elected to the Epsom Road Board in 1901 and served until April 1920. In 1903 the Edgerley family sold the upper part of their land to George Goldsboro architect (now 66 Gillies Ave) for £196 and part to Alfred Kidd (now 74 Gillies Ave) for £180. Like Highwic, these properties were chosen because the building platforms, on land rising up the slopes of Mount Eden, had views across the valley and down to the harbour. Around this period, Mr Goldsboro built Mrs Wilson's house at 66 and Mr Kidd built a house at 74 to designs by Mr Goldsbro’. The entrances were from Domain Rd now called Gillies Avenue. The land must have been wooded with volcanic rock forest as there is the large stump of a mature puriri tree under the Kidd house. Around 1917, John and William Edgerley sold land to the south of the homestead to allow the Kidd family to extend their gardens . From 1926, the Edgerleys subdivided the property to the east of the homestead creating Edgerley Avenue from the drive to their house. John Edgerley Jr died on 1 October 1942 aged 97 in the house at 11 Edgerley Ave. In 1942 the homestead was bought by AC Wood who commissioned the Californian architect A B Crocombe to renovate the property. This was done in the “modern American colonial style” and was featured in the New Zealand Institute of Architects ‘Home & Building’ magazine in 1944 as a good example of modernising a villa. Although the outbuildings, a laundry, a workshop and a woodshed have been demolished the house remains exactly as re- designed in 1943. Neither The Newmarket Heritage Study, (Report to Focus Newmarket group, Dinah Holman, February 1996) nor Historic Places Trust's submissions to Plan Change 196 make any mention of the Edgerley homestead. Under Plan Change 196, the zoning alters from 7a to 8c – highly intensive high-rise of up to six stories. In July 2010 the Edgerley homestead was sold by A&C; Shaw to Runcorn Hotel Development Corporation, a China-based development company, along with the former Carlton Bowling Club and the former garden of 74 Gillies Ave. The deal for the entire site was in the region of $22 million. On 16 January 2011, in a telephone conversation with staff of Thresher Urban Design and Landscape Architecture, who have been contracted by Runcorn Hotel Development Corporation to assist them with their planning application, Paul Waite learns that their initial proposals do not include retention of any trees or historic buildings but Runcorn has proposed highly intense development of the site. In 2011 a demolition permit was issued by Auckland Council for the Edgerley homestead.

The main goal of Rostest is governmental standards control aimed at ensuring and maintaining uniformity of measurements in industry, health care, communication systems, trading, military defense, and resource counting as well as environmental protection and other economic activities.  Activities  The Rostest specialists perform checking, calibrating, testing different means of measuring for approving the type, validation of the testing equipment as well as the methods of performing measurements.  Certification in Russia  Rostest mark according to GOST R 50460-92 The new Rostest mark of certification was introduced in Russia in 1992 and went into effect on 1 July 1993. In order to import and sell goods in Russia it is necessary to draw up permissive documents, including Correspondence Certificates, Correspondence Declaration, and Letters of Refusal. The main objective of Rostest is to draw up permissive certification documents. The institutions that cooperate with Rostest in Russia include: Russian Techno Regulation, Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES), Russian Consumer Rights' Supervision, RRIS (Russian Research Institute of Certification). On receiving the necessary Russian certificates any foreign manufacturers get an advantage over other manufacturers: they can offer their products with necessary documents and thus save money of distributors. If earlier distributors and Russian buyers of foreign products had to draw up the certification documents, so nowadays most Russian customers wish to purchase the products that already have all necessary Russian certificates. The Rostest certification center cooperates directly with manufacturers and draws up the certificates according to different certification schemes. One of them is to draw up the documents for the series of products. This scheme allows transfer of a copy of the certificate to any Russian buyer or distributor.  Mission of Rostest  On the base of Rostest in Moscow they founded one of the first organs for certification of products and services and the quality systems within the system of obligatory certification in the early 1990s. The certification within the obligatory certification system (OCS) proves the safety of goods and services for people and the environment. This type of certification is necessary for importing and selling products into the territory of the Russian Federation.

Plot Cristina, the princess of a fictional monarchical state named Saint Tulipe, is visiting Rome with her father, Gustavo VI, who is trying to appeal to Italy's national bank for a loan to buoy his country's financial crisis. Bored and rebellious, Cristina sneaks away from the embassy and decides to engage in a sightseeing tour of the city. On the bus she takes, Cristina meets the driver Barnaba Cecchini, who instantly falls in love with her. Barnaba, a charming and happy-to-go ATAC employee, takes Cristina around the city, including the Forum Romanum, and slowly begins to win her personal interest. But after having had her fun and spending a (chaste) night in his apartment, she locks him into his clothes dresser's massive drawer and leaves with her family's bodyguards without telling him about her true identity. After a fruitless search on his own, Barnaba recognizes her when he witnesses a TV report about her sojourn in Rome, and despite his modest background he boldly asks her father for her hand. When Gustavo refuses, Barnaba engages in a series of daredevil schemes to prove his worth, even to the point of appearing (by Cristina's invitation) at a royal banquet in his ATAC uniform and holding successful discussions about high politics with a number of international dignitaries. However, although Barnaba succeeds in impressing Gustavo and winning Cristina's genuine affection, Saint Tulipe's financial crisis finally drives the king into engaging his daughter to an arms manufacturer. Determined not to lose the love of his life, Barnaba appeals to the citizens of Rome to make a donation for the cause. As Gustavo's family leaves the city, Barnaba's sympathizers shower them with money, thus annulling both the royal debts and Cristina's planned engagement to a stranger, and Barnaba gaining Gustavo's approval to marry his daughter.

Pequeño grupo arqueológico de estructuras de factura inka. ... . also Muyuqmarka (Quechua, hispanicized spellings Moyoc Marca, Muyucmarca, Muyuqmarca, Muyucmarka, Muyuc Marca, Muyuc Marka), is an archaeological site in Peru. It is the base of what was a round Incan tower, which is situated within the fortress Saksaywaman above Cuzco. It was used as a Temple of Inti (god Sun), but became part of a complex of rectangular buildings which mostly still remain today. However, the temple and the two flanking towers were dismantled during the Spanish rule. What remains of Muyuq Marka indicates that it was \\"a round building with an open central court which had a fountain.\\" The temple had triple walls, which were aligned with the zenith sunrise and the antizenith sunset. It was one of the three towers that were in the upper part of the Inca temple of Sacsayhuamán. This tower is famous because in 1536, in the Battle of Sacsayhuaman the Inca army soldier named Cahuide jumped from the top of the tower so as not to fall into the hands of the Spaniards.Willka Jankani y Carlos Piazzini N. (compilers), Muyucmarca de Sacsayhuamán. According to \\"Inca\\" Garcilaso de la Vega this tower was a store of pure water. The Muyuqmarka consists of three concentric, circular stone walls connected by a series of radial walls. There are three channels constructed to bring water into what many scientists consider to be a reservoir. A web-like pattern of 34 lines intersects at the center and there is also a pattern of concentric circles that corresponded to the location of the circular walls. Originally, the Myuqmarka was a building with 4 superposed floors. The first body would have had a square floor; the second would have been cylindrical; the third would have had also a cylindrical shape. The successive would have formed circular cultivation terraces with decreasing width, being the widest of 3.6 m and the narrowest of 3 m. The tower would have ended up in a conic ceiling. Muyu Marca must have reached a total height of 20 meters. It was as amazing work that generated the admiration of several chroniclers. The Spaniards destroyed it, in spite of the protests both from Cieza and Inca Garcilaso. (3)http://www.ancient- wisdom.co.uk/perusacsahuaman.htm  Description by the chronicles  View of Muyuq Marka with the city of Cusco in the background. Several chroniclers name three towers that were on top of the hill of Sacsayhuamán. One of them is Pedro Sánchez de la Hoz who entered Cusco along with Francisco Pizarro. In his chronicle he tells us that in Sacsayhuamán there were three towers, the one in the middle in a cubic form of four or five bodies superimposed one on top of the other. However, Garcilaso de la Vega contradicts him by stating that the middle tower was circular in shape. But both agree that there were three towers and that their sizes were considerable. \\"Inca\\" Garcilaso narrates that under the towers there were huge tunnels that interconnected with each other even between the three towers, he also says that in his childhood he used to play there but only until the beginning of its destruction by the Spaniards. Subsequently, Pedro Pizarro referred to two towers \\"formed by two very tall cubes\\", probably he only managed to observe Paucamarca and Sallacmarca because Muyuq Marka had already been destroyed by the Spaniards.

In 1980, he successfully completed a doctorate on the early work of Friedrich Nietzsche under the direction of Hans Heinz Holz, Gert Mattenklott and Katharina Kanthack.Dissertation: Ein Text ohne Ende für den Denkenden. 1st edition 1982, 2nd expanded edition 1989, Frankfurt am Main, . From 1983 to 1985, holding grants from the German Academic Exchange Service and the Italian foreign ministry, he worked in Florence with Mazzino Montinari, who was editing the first Nietzsche edition free of falsifications, based on the studies he had been carrying out in Weimar since the 1960s. Until 1997, Schmidt-Grépály lectured in philosophy at the Universities of Florence, Kiel, Oldenburg and Bremen, then from 1998 at Jena and the Bauhaus University, Weimar.

Machu Picchu was thought to have been built c. 1450 by the Sapa Inca Pachacuti as a country estate, although it is equally likely that the Inca discovered much older ruins (the inti watana, the temple of the sun, and the temple of the condor) and opted to build this majestic estate on older foundations. . In the late 16th century, the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo and the clergy destroyed those Intihuatana which they could find. They did so as they believed that the Incas' religion was a blasphemy and the religious significance of the Intihuatana could be a political liability. The Intihuatana of Machu Picchu was found intact by Bingham in 1911, indicating that the Spanish conquerors had not found it. Design The Intihuatana of Machu Picchu was carved directly into the bedrock of the mountain's summit area. It is characterized by complex surfaces, planes and angles whose purpose at this time is unknown. Incomplete descriptions of its purpose by the Inca in their chronicles only add to its mysterious existence. Archeological explanations which are not currently mainstream assert that the Inca did not construct Inti Watana but rather found it, along with other mysterious structures pre-existing at Maccu Picchu. This implies a problematic consideration, that the Inti Watana's construction was done by an as-yet-unknown, apparently highly advanced earlier civilization. Current archeological thought has no rigorous explanation who this earlier culture could have been. Featuring a slightly inclined plane at its top, an upright stone column tilts 13 degrees northward. Other features include a granite block resembling a carved shelf, bench, or altar, and a rectangular base. Intihuatana Function Possibly used as a sundial, it was aligned with the sun's position during the winter solstice. The Inca believed the stone held the sun in its place along its annual path in the sky. At midday on the equinoxes the sun stands almost above the pillar, casting no shadow at all. At midday on 11 November and 30 January, the sun stands almost exactly above the pillar, casting no shadow. On June 21, the stone is casting the longest shadow on its southern side and on December 21, a much shorter one on its northern side. The base is said to be \\"in the shape of a map of the Inca Empire\\" but most archaeologists disagree, observing that the base is squat and stubby whereas the Tawantinsuyu is long and thin. Pedro Sueldo Nava describes the landmark as \\"perhaps one of the most beautiful and enigmatic places to be found in Machu Picchu.\\"  See also  * Inti, the ancient Incan sun god * Kusichaka River * Machu Q'inti * Pakaymayu * Phutuq K'usi * Wayna Pikchu * Wayna Q'inti * Sallqantay References Archaeological sites in Peru Ancient astronomy Inca Empire Archaeological sites in Cusco Region 15th-century establishments in the Inca civilization 16th-century disestablishments in the Inca civilization 1911 archaeological discoveries ","title":"Intihuatana, Urubamba"},{"id":"36449585","text":"The Free University of New York (FUNY) was an educational social enterprise initiated by Allen Krebs, Sharon Krebs and James Mellen in July 1965. as reproduced in FUNY began as a home for professors dismissed from local universities for protesting the Vietnam War, or for holding socialist views.

History The MediaNews Group logo, which still appears on print newspapers. MediaNews Group was founded by Richard Scudder and William Dean Singleton. Both had experience in the American newspaper industry. Scudder ran the Newark (New Jersey) News, a newspaper founded by his grandfather. Singleton had begun his career as a reporter when he was 15, for a small-town Texas newspaper and subsequently became the president of Albritton Communications, a newspaper conglomerate in Texas. Based in Denver, Colorado, Scudder and Singleton purchased their first newspaper in 1983. They incorporated MediaNews Group in 1985, with Singleton as CEO and Scudder as chairman. The company began to purchase small local newspapers that were undergoing financial troubles. In 1987, the company made its first major acquisition: the Denver Post. Ultimately, it became one of the largest newspaper companies in the United States. It operated 56 daily newspapers in 12 states, with combined daily and Sunday circulation of about 2.4 million and 2.7 million, respectively.http://www.medianewsgroup.com/about/ Blurb from the corporate websitehttp://www.medianewsgroup.com/about/ MediaNews Group About Page The company owned KTVA, a CBS affiliate in Anchorage, Alaska, from March 2000 to October 2012, and radio stations in Texas. Singleton was a pioneer in \\"clustering\\": cutting jobs at individual newspapers and consolidating functions at a hub near a cluster of newspapers. For example, the Alameda Newspaper Group in suburban San Francisco in the mid-1990s had a central newsroom in Pleasanton, California, that did all the copy editing, layout and page makeup for five daily papers. Upon acquiring the diverse group of papers, Singleton consolidated several news sections (such as sports and features) to one local office away from the metropolitan area, having a few reporters do the job of many people. Singleton soon earned the nickname \\"Lean Dean\\" for his slashing of jobs through clustering. His tight-fisted methods were later adopted as the preferred model by Alden Global Capital and other hedge funds that took over near-bankrupt newspaper companies. In August 2006, Singleton took out around $350 million in loans to purchase four newspapers from McClatchy Company. Among those providing the loan was the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\\"\\"Gates Foundation Makes MediaNews Loan\\", Toronto Star. August 22, 2006. It came out of bankruptcy in March 2010 under the majority ownership of its lenders. The MediaNews creditors then removed Media News president Jody Lodovic and its chairman, William Dean Singleton, was reassigned to the position of “executive chairman of the board.\\" The Singleton-Lodovic appointees to the MediaNews board were replaced by new directors representing the stockholders group led by Alden Global Capital, a hedge fund firm which has acquired a large, though not controlling, stake. Several interim executive positions were also filled by people related to Alden or its parent, Smith Management LLC. MediaNews became managed by Journal Register's Digital First Media. As of 2012, the combined newspapers and online media outlets managed by the company had 66.6 million readers. In 2017, the company was ranked third-largest among the newspaper groups in the country. Alden Global Capital has been accused of \\"strip mining\\" its newspaper holdings. In October 2017, the company's CEO, Steve Rossi, stepped down from his position. In February 2018, Digital First Media put in a $11.9 million winning bid to purchase the Boston Herald. In March 2016, a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of Freedom Communications and its two major newspapers, the Orange County Register and the Riverside Press-Enterprise to Digital First Media. The papers were integrated into Digital First Media's Los Angeles Newspaper Group, which was renamed the Southern California News Group on the same day. In November 2018, DFM announced plans to lay off 107 staff from its Colorado Springs, Colorado financial services operations, as it outsources the work to Genpact starting December 28. In January 2019, Digital First Media acquired 7.5% of Gannett's public stock, and made an unsolicited bid to acquire Gannett for $1.36 billion. On February 4, 2019 Gannett's board \\"unanimously rejected\\" the offer, saying \\"that MNG does not have a realistic plan to acquire Gannett\\". On February 11, 2019, Gannett issued a press release accusing Digital First Media of engaging in a proxy fight. After a failed attempt to place 3 nominees on Gannett's board of directors through a proxy vote on May 16, 2019, DFM reduced their stake to 4.2%. In August 2019, GateHouse Media ultimately announced its intent to acquire Gannett instead. On Feb. 5, 2020, MediaNews Group purchased the assets of Red Wing Publishing/Big Fish Works. The sale included the Hutchinson Leader, the Litchfield Independent Review, the International Falls Journal, the Lakeshore Weekly News, the Chanhassen Villager, Chaska Herald, Eden Prairie News, Jordan Independent, Shakopee Valley News, Prior Lake American and the Savage Pacer. In April 2020, the two of west metro newspapers - The Eden Prairie News and Lakeshore Weekly News bought earlier in 2020 by Digital First Media, announced their closure at the end of April 2020 due to a decline in advertising revenue during the coronavirus outbreak.

The company has a reputation for buying smaller daily newspapers in a single area (examples include Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area) and consolidating their operations, including sharing staff writers and printing facilities. As a result of the cost-cutting, some former employees say that the newspapers are focused on making a profit to the detriment of good journalism. William Dean Singleton was quick to point out MediaNews's commitment to print journalism but resisted efforts to develop online web sites for his newspapers, believing print would remain the format favored by readers. The Berkshire Eagle editor David E. Scribner, two years after MediaNews bought his newspaper, said the staff realized Singleton had miscalculated the impact of the internet and attributed the downward spiral of his media properties to his short-sightedness.Elfland, Mike. \\"Sentinel & Enterprise Sale Set,\\" Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), January 8, 1997. In recent years similar criticism has been aimed at the new organizational structure under Digital First Media. The Denver Post editorial staff and others have criticized the owners of hedge fund group, Alden Global Capital. Alden has a reputation for cutting costs by reducing the number of journalists working on its newspapers as Singleton had done and March 2018, The Washington Post called Alden \\"one of the most ruthless of the corporate strip-miners seemingly intent on destroying local journalism.\\" Alden has additionally received critical coverage from its editorial staff of the Denver Post and described Alden Global Capital as \\"vulture capitalists\\" after multiple staff layoffs. Pension fund controversy The company has been criticized for investing its employee pensions in funds managed by its parent company, Alden Global Capital.  Antitrust allegations  On July 14, 2006, San Francisco businessman and real estate investor Clint Reilly filed a lawsuit against MediaNews Group and San Francisco Chronicle parent Hearst Communications, alleging that the two companies have been conspiring to control advertising rates, a violation of antitrust laws. In November 2006, Reilly's attorney presented to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston a letter from Hearst senior vice president James Asher to MediaNews President Jody Lodovic that said the two companies agreed to \\"offer national advertising and internet advertising sales for their San Francisco Bay Area newspapers on a joint basis, and to consolidate the San Francisco Bay Area distribution networks of such newspapers ....\\" Illston, suggesting she had been misled by the companies when they said they had not been collaborating, issued a 14-page rulingU.S. District Court Order Re: Second Application for Temporary Restraining Order, November 28, 2006. forbidding Hearst and MediaNews from working together on national advertising sales or distribution. On December 21, 2006, the San Francisco Bay Guardian and nonprofit Media Alliance filed suit to make the details of Reilly's lawsuit—and MediaNews and the Chronicle's response—public. As a result of the filing, many documents in the case were voluntarily disclosed by the defendants. The judge allowed redacted versions of two more documents to be released. She kept 17 others under seal. One of the documents unsealed was the deposition of Hearst's Asher, who says that as of September 2006, his company had recorded cumulative losses of $330 million on its investment in the Chronicle, which it acquired in mid-2000. He said Hearst proposed selling the Chronicle to MediaNews, but MediaNews didn't offer enough money. Asher also said Hearst and MediaNews have discussed working together for years. Although the trial was scheduled to start Monday, April 30, 2007 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, the parties announced Wednesday, April 25, 2007 that a settlement had been reached.

William Porter (1805-1880) was attorney-general of the Cape Colony and a drafter of its first constitution in 1854. Early life William Porter was born in Ireland (Derry) on 15 September 1805 into a family with strong liberal convictions. He read law and was called to the Bar of Ireland in 1831. Political manoeuvrings in Britain in the 1830s led to an interim of liberal control in London, and the new government swiftly replaced conservative civil servants with known liberals throughout the Empire. Porter's family's liberal convictions, as well as his own, put him in line for such an opportunity, and in 1839 he was appointed as Attorney General of the Cape of Good Hope. Attorney-General (1839-1865) Porter arrived in the Cape Colony, bringing what he called \\"an unspeakable hatred of oppression of every kind\\", and set about promoting equal rights and justice for all, regardless of race or class. The prominence of his position in the Cape helped to bring liberal principles into the mainstream in the conservative colony. Several progressive local leaders such as Saul Solomon, John Molteno and John Fairbairn soon surfaced and, taking advantage of their beliefs' new acceptability, began to take control of the Cape's politics.RFM Immelman: Men of Good Hope, 1804-1954. CTCC: Cape Town, 1955. When the Cape was granted its first Parliament in 1854, Porter was one of the primary drafters of the infant State's constitution. The constitution prohibited discrimination on the basis of race and made provision for a franchise system where whites and blacks voted on equal terms and without distinction. This was the birth of the uniquely multiracial \\"Cape Qualified Franchise\\".P. A. Molteno: The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1900R.W. Murray: South African Reminiscences. Cape Town:JC Juta & Co. 1894. Political career (1865-1873) William Porter in later life. When he retired from his position as attorney-general in 1865, Porter entered politics, and was elected to the parliament which he had assisted in creating. Here the local leader John Molteno, who shared Porter's political views, had achieved a degree of parliamentary control and was using this electoral base to push for the next stage in independence from Britain, a locally-accountable executive, or \\"Responsible Government\\". Porter joined this movement for responsible government, lending his considerable moral authority as an acknowledged \\"father\\" of the Cape's constitution. His final years in politics were spent in the drive for women's rights, religious freedom and the abolition of capital punishment in the Cape. In 1872, the Cape finally attained Responsible Government and Molteno approached Porter with an invitation to become the Cape's first Prime Minister. Porter declined however, citing ill-health.N. Worden: Cape Town: The Making of a City. New Africa Books. 2011Illustrated History of South Africa. The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. Later life The refusal of honours however, was quite typical for Porter's personality. He also turned down a knighthood and a chief justiceship among other offers. He retired from politics in 1873 and returned to Ireland, leaving a prosperous, democratic and stable Cape Colony with a rapidly growing economy. He settled in Belfast for his final years and died in 1880. The tiny town of Porterville, Western Cape, (est.1863) was named after him.J. L.

Background  ATTF had been carrying on attacks on Bengali Hindu settlements in a bid to oust all post-1949 settlers from the state. They along with the NLFT had massacred 30 Bengali Hindus in May 2003. The village of Kamalnagar is situated on a sharp bend on the Agartala Khowai Road, under Kalyanpur police station in West Tripura District. It was a sparsely populated village abundant with mango and jackfruit trees and inhabited by impoverished Bengali Hindu farmers. The dwellings consisted of mud huts and lacked electricity connection. Some of the residents had moved to Kamalnagar from Kalyanpur in 2000, due to fear of attacks by the militants.  Killings  In 2003, on the eve of independence day at around 9-45 pm, the All Tripura Tiger Force insurgents attacked Kamalnagar. The attackers first cordoned off the entire village and set fire to the huts. As the people rushed out of their huts, the militants fired indiscriminately on those came in front of them. Others were chased down and shot at. Some of the militants entered the huts and fired at their victims hiding below the bed. A few villagers were axed to death. During the killing spree the attackers continuously abused the victims. The attacks lasted around half an hour. According to unconfirmed reports Tripuri villagers from neighbouring areas accompanied the militants. Fourteen Bengali Hindu villagers including seven members of one family were killed in the massacre. Many were injured in the attack. T.B. Roy, the Superintendent of Police arrived on the spot soon after the massacre on his way to Agartala from Khowai.  Aftermath  Tensions began to mount in the Kamalnagar and neighbouring villages of Kalyanpur police station in the aftermath of the massacre. More than 300 Bengali Hindu families abandoned their houses in Kamalpur and took shelter at the Kamalpur High School. The Tripuris residing in the area, including government employees, students and patients all fled the area in fear of backlash. The locals blocked the road, demanding a permanent Tripura State Rifles outpost. Five ministers who went to visit Kamalnagar were heckled by the public.  Investigation  On the next day, one of the survivors filed a written complaint at the Kalyanpur police station. On 5 January 2009, two ATTF commanders identified as Michael and Royal Debbarma who were responsible for the massacre surrendered before the Sub-Divisional Police Officer of Jirania in the West Tripura District. The police investigated the incident and framed charge sheet against seventeen accused. The trial began in 2009 at the Additional District and Sessions Court in Khowai in which the testimonies of 38 witnesses were recorded. At the end of the trial three persons Kartik Debbarma, Brajendra Debbarma and Ashok Debbarma were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The rest fourteen were acquitted due to lack of evidence.

Located in the Parish of San Antonio of Quito Canton in Pichincha Province, it has an elevation of and is located on a mountaintop about above valleys on either side. Attributed to the Pre- Columbian era Quitu-Cara culture, it was presumably used as an astronomical observatory even before the arrival of the Incas, and is the only prehispanic site in the Americas that is located precisely at the Earth's Equator. History Catequilla is translated from Quechua to mean \\"follower of the moon\\". Its construction, circa 800 AD, is attributed to the Quitu-Cara culture. The site consists of a semicircular wall, in length with a diameter of , although no clear architectural features accurately show the exact positions of its ends. It leans toward the east end south sides with at an azimuth of 113 degrees, and declines on the western end to the north side, with an azimuth of 293 degrees. The wall height varies between and , but based on the broken material beside it, the wall could have been more than high. In the northwest of the site, there is a lithic disk (a circular stone-filled platform) in diameter, consisting mainly of stone masonry. It has three lines of stones. Situated on a hill, there was a water source at the site at one time. Along with the stone-filled circles of Jarata and Pacpo to the south, it forms a straight line along which the shade from the mountains falls during the June solstice. While many of the indigenous people today believe that the purpose of these circles was to provide a solid flat surface for the threshing of wheat and other cereals, several astronomic and geodetic alignments have been detected, questioning the validity of this theory. After several archaeological excavations by Oswaldo Tovar, many ceramics were unearthed from Incan and colonial times. Though the site is virtually abandoned, nearby mining operations in the area could jeopardize its integrity. Even so, the government has taken no action. As it is located on the equator, it is said to be in the \\"Middle of the World\\". As of 2011, it is said to be \\"the only important pre-Inca site in Ecuador to have been commercially exploited.\\" The Inca pucara (stone fortress) of Rumicucho is located about north of Catequilla.

The role of an anti-intrusion bar is to absorb the kinetic energy of the colliding vehicles that is partially converted into internal work of the members involved in the crash. Performance The performance of a side beam is measured by several indicators. The most important are: * the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA), which measures the amount of energy absorbed per unit mass; * and the energy efficiency η, which is the ratio between the mean load and the peak load transmitted to the vehicle during the impact. Furthermore: * the amount of intrusion, for a given energy, must be as small as possible; * the maximum depth or diameter of the bar must be reasonably small, as the vehicle door does not generally allow much space; * the cost of the member must be reasonably small. Typical design The anti-intrusion beams commonly span the length of the door at about a vertical midsection of the door. As the figure shows, the typical profiles can be open or closed (tubular, usually with a round cross section). Some examples of anti-intrusion bars for cars They are conventionally made by stamping or hydroforming processes. When the cross section is closed, the tubes can be used as-received.

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons headquarters. Gerhard Michael Kallmann (February 13, 1915 – June 19, 2012) was a German-born American architect and academic. Together with Michael McKinnell, Kallman is best known as the lead designer of Boston City Hall, which was constructed in 1968 by their architectural design firm, Kallmann McKinnell & Wood. Life and career Kallman was born to Theodore and Olga Jarecki Kallmann in Berlin, Germany, on February 13, 1915. His family was Jewish and intellectual. They moved to the United Kingdom in 1937 and Kallman enrolled at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. He immigrated to the United States with his family in 1948. He began teaching at the Chicago Institute of Design less than one year after arriving in the U.S. Kallman became an assistant professor of architecture at Columbia University in 1954. In the early 1960s, Boston Mayor proposed a new city hall as part of plan to revitalize a declining section of the city's downtown. A competition was held to design a new city hall. Kallman, then a professor at Columbia University, and Michael McKinnell, a Columbia graduate student submitted a design for the proposed Boston City Hall in 1962. Kallman and McKinnell defeated many established, better known architects to win the contest for the new city hall. Kallman and McKinnell founded their new firm in 1962 shortly after winning the competition, Kallmann, McKinnell & Knowles (now called Kallmann, McKinnell & Wood), and moved to Boston to work on their city hall design. Influences for city hall, a large concrete structure, included the Le Corbusier’s monastery at La Tourette, France. Boston City Hall, which they designed in a New Brutalism style popular in 1960s, was completed in 1968. Though controversial and even derided among some Bostonians, who have called it a \\"giant concrete harmonica\\" and a \\"dungeon,\\" Boston City Hall had an important impact on the city. While called a \\"hall of shame\\" by the urban planning nonprofit, Project for Public Spaces, a 1976 survey of architects named it one of the top ten buildings in the United States. Kallman remained best known for Boston City Hall. However, he also designed the headquarters of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague and United States embassy in Bangkok, Thailand. Kallman also designed entire campuses for the University of California and buildings for Ohio State University and Brandeis University. Gerhard Kallmann died in Boston on June 19, 2012, at the age of 97.

It is available for Windows, iPhone and Android. In 2012, it won the DemoGod Award at DEMO Spring '12. Technology In a real-life conversation, sounds follow a complex journey before reaching the listener's ears. Listeners's brains then analyse the sounds and their alterations to determine the source's position in the room. This enables them to identify the speaker even without seeing them or recognizing their voice. In a crowded, noisy room, the brain can isolate specific sounds and focus on decoding relevant information while disregarding other sounds, a phenomenon also called the cocktail party effect. Traditional conferencing software uses one microphone that mixes all sounds, losing this location information and making it impossible for the brain to use spatial information to filter what it is hearing. This increases fatigue by requiring listeners to distinguish who is speaking, as well as what they are saying. Voxeet uses multiple microphones to reproduce natural location mechanisms, creating a virtual 3D audio space that makes listening easier and less taxing. Features Voxeet allows up to 8 participants to have online conferences with high definition voice and 3D sound on Windows computers, and iPhone and Android phones.

It increases the pathogenicity of the cell. More specifically, it is found in streptococcal M-like plasminogen (Pg)-binding protein (PAM) from Gram-positive group-A streptococci (GAS). VEK-30 represents an epitope within PAM that shows high affinity for the lysine binding site (LBS) of the kringle-2 (K2) domain of human (h)Pg. Plasminogen Plasminogen (Pg) is an important mediator of angiostatin production in the fibrinolytic pathway. Plasminogen is made up of five subunit kringle molecules (Pg-K1 to Pg-K5), of which the first three make the protein angiostatin. VEK-30 is a protein domain of the group A streptococcal protein PAM. It binds to Pg-K2 domain of angiostatin and activates the molecule to mediate its anti- angiogenic effects. VEK-30 binds to angiostatin via a C-terminal lysine with argininyl and glutamyl side chain residues known as a 'through space isostere'. Function Since VEK-30 binds to Pg-K2 domain of angiostatin, its function is crucial to blood clotting, and in lower organisms increase their pathogenicity.

History In 1888 Daniel McGilvary, an American missionary of Scottish origin and founder of the Laos Mission, established a church house and a school in Chiang Saen District, Chiang Rai Province, which he named \\"Boys School\\". This school was located near the banks of the Kok River, close to the confluence with the Mekong. After less than twenty years this school was moved to Chiang Rai city, to its present location near the Overbrook Hospital. In 1914 missionaries of the Presbyterian Church in the United States took over the management. The school used to give education exclusively to boys until 1927, when girls were admitted. In 1934 it was renamed \\"Christian Witthayakhom School\\" after having been merged with a certain girls' school that had also been founded by Christian missionaries.โรงเรียนเชียงรายวิทยาคม ประวัติโดยสังเขป In 1941, during World War II and the Japanese invasion of Thailand, Christianity was considered the \\"religion of the enemies\\": the Allies of World War II.

In 1953, eight years after the war, the school reestablished Christian education led by the Church of Christ in Thailand, the oldest Protestant umbrella organization in Thailand. It was renamed Chiengrai Vidhayakhome School, which gave the school the acronym CVK that it uses nowadays. A street divides the northern and the southern wing of the school.

The valley contains the Cerro de Catequilla, which contains the pre-Columbian astronomical observatory, Catequilla. The village of Pomasqui itself lies roughly from the equator. The Monjas River flows nearby and the valley is an important centre for viniculture in Ecuador, with vineyards. The economy features vegetable and fruit production. To the northwest is the Pululahua Geobotanical Reserve. History The valley played an important role in military conflict as the Spanish army under Benalcazar invaded in 1534. Atahualpa leaders such as Rumiñahui and Quizquiz led organized attacks against the invading Spanish, and some 4000 locals were slaughtered by them here for giving in to the invaders.

It is a type of systemic bias. Several factors can lead to respondent error. Language and educational issues can lead to a misunderstanding of the question by the respondent, or similarly, a misunderstanding of the response by the surveyor. Recall bias can lead to misinformation based on a respondent misrecalling the facts in question. Social desirability bias can lead a respondent to respond in a fashion that he or she thinks is correct or better or less embarrassing, rather than providing true and honest responses. When designing a survey it should be remembered that uppermost in the respondent's mind will be protecting their own personal privacy, integrity and interests. Also, the way the respondent interprets the questionnaire and the wording of the answer the respondent gives can cause inaccuracies to enter the survey data. Careful questionnaire design, effective training of interviewers and adequate survey testing can overcome these problems to some extent. Sometimes, it also may be a case that a particular survey is being done for a socially prohibited issue, like use of pantyhose as conducted by DuPont in 2001-02. For such surveys questionnaire may not be as successful as a Projective Technique. So, some cases can be classified where the respondents may intentionally generate an error.

He is the founder of Taghyeer (Change), a Palestinian national movement promoting nonviolence to achieve and guarantee a nonviolent solution to the conflict. Awwad’s story and efforts have been featured in over twelve documentaries including two award-winning films, Encounter Point and Forbidden Childhood. Furthermore, he was honored by the global nonprofit thinktank Synergos as the Arab World Social Innovator in Palestine for \\"introducing non-violence, reconciliation, and civic participation to Palestinians as a means of empowering citizens to seek social change and find a more equitable solution to conflict.\\" Awwad is currently finishing his memoir called Painful Hope, an account of his experiences as well as his strategy and vision for the Palestinian future. He lives in Beit Ummar, near Hebron. Biography Refugees from Al-Qubayba near Bayt Jibrin, Awwad’s family was forced off their land in the 1948 Palestine war (The Nakba) and subsequently settled in Beit Ummar. Awwad, born in Halhoul in Hebron Governorate in the West Bank, was raised in a politically active family and at a young age, following in his mother's footsteps, became a member of Fatah. (His mother was a close associate of Yasser Arafat and was a leader of Fatah in the region). Prior to becoming a nonviolent activist, he served two prison sentences in Israel. First arrested while studying for secondary exams (after an Israeli helicopter observer reported seeing him throw stones), Awwad refused to pay a 1,500 shekel fine, stating later that, although a stone- thrower, he had not participated that day. He was imprisoned for three months. Eight months later, he took part in the First Intifada as a teenager, and was subsequently sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of stone-throwing, throwing Molotov cocktails, and being active in a military cell. According to Awwad, his major crime consisted in refusing to cooperate with his interrogators who wanted information concerning his mother's political activities. He served four years and was released after the signing of the Oslo Accords. Along with 280 released prisoners, he was confined to Jericho for the remainder of his sentence. Awwad’s story of transformation, from former militant to supporter and educator of nonviolence, began during his second stint in prison. In 1993, he coordinated a hunger strike with his mother, also in prison at the time, in order for them to see each other. After 17 days on strike, their confiners permitted the request. The success of the strike was a turning point: \\"When we succeeded, it transformed my political mind; I realised that another, non-violent, way to achieve my rights existed. I had been blinded by arguments – about blame, victimhood, punishment and justice. But now I realised that showing my humanity in a non-violent way was the best weapon to achieve my rights.\\" On his release, he was recruited by the PA as a security officer, working for them until he resigned in 1997 out of disagreement and despair. On 20 October 2000, after the outbreak of the Al Aqsa Intifada, According to Awwad he was shot in the leg by an Israeli settler. He was evacuated to Saudi Arabia, where he received medical treatment. On returning, Awwad learned of his brother Yousef's death. Yousef was an employee of a company that worked with the Jewish National Fund, and, according to his brother, was not involved in militant activities. He was shot in the head by an Israeli soldier at a close distance. (In a further account, Awwad says the shooting arose from talking back to the soldier, a violation of a new regulation of which he was unaware). Yousef's tragedy marked another turn in Awwad's personal and political life: \\"My brother wasn't a criminal or a terrorist, he was my best friend, a beautiful man who had two kids who he wanted to raise,\\" he recalls. \\"I spent sleepless nights with my suffering. I struggled with the concepts of justice and revenge. But taking revenge was not the answer for me. Not because there was a lack of pain or anger but because what I wanted was justice. Yet the only real justice – to have my brother back again – was impossible. When I realised that, I hated myself, my enemy and the whole world. I felt that I was the victim of everyone.\\"  Becoming an activist  Awwad, together with his mother and brother Khalid, became a member of the Bereaved Families Forum, after its founder reached out to the family expressing condolences and support. A year after Yousef's death, Awwad's mother hosted a group of bereaved Israeli parents. At the forum, Awwad met and was befriended by Robi Damelin. Their connection resulted in a years- long world tour, the two activists arguing that peace can only occur if reconciliation takes place between the victims. Awwad’s political consciousness changed as a result of these talks. > \\"I began a complex, painful journey in non-violence and reconciliation, > touring almost 40 countries and speaking out in order to bring this message. > But I also realised it was essential to create a national Palestinian non- > violent movement that would ensure two things: that we could resist > occupation non-violently, but [also] that we would stop being victims and > begging others to help us. I believe this first step has to come from us. > This doesn’t mean Israel isn’t guilty or that we are angels. But we have to > create a place where we will no longer be prisoners of the anger that this > situation creates every day. We must escape the prison of our narrative.\\" Along with other activists, ex-prisoners, and youth, Awwad created the Taghyeer movement with the aim \\"to show people that they can develop themselves without waiting for others.\\" He adds, \\"We have visited communities and engaged community leaders in order to create the mass movement that will guarantee enough pressure [and support] on politicians of both sides.\\"  Taghyeer and nonviolence  Awwad began reading into the nonviolent strategies and philosophies of Gandhi, Mandela, and Martin Luther King Jr. while imprisoned. Acting upon those principles first with the hunger strike and later by founding and organizing Taghyeer, Awwad sees nonviolence as manifesting a lifestyle of successfully defending one's rights. On 24 September 2016, Taghyeer organized a mass demonstration in support of \\"nonviolent transformation\\" for over 3,000 Palestinian men, women, and children hailing from areas throughout the West Bank. The movement also serves as a grassroots initiative incubator, organizing workshops and community actions to empower local Palestinians by identifying \\"community priorities\\" and by initiating \\"the appropriate projects throughout the West Bank.\\" Taghyeer, the Metta Center for Nonviolence writes, is dedicated \\"to fostering Palestinian national nonviolent identity in action – through which communities, leaders, and organizations come together to address social development needs, and at the same time resist occupation and open a path to resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\\" When peace negotiations have stalled and Palestinian suffering continues, Awwad points to nonviolence as a path for hope: \\"The Palestinians have been living in extreme despair for years and both the international community and Israeli society have given us no hope, no model of peaceful solution. The role of nonviolence is to speak to people's despair – not to tell them they are right, but to show them a way out.\\" Nonviolence, as Awwad sees it, transforms those who embody its way of life: \\"I think nonviolence is the celebration of my existence. I used to wake up, and I wish that I was not born. Today I wake up and I celebrate this.\\"  Reconciliation efforts  Awwad is a friend of Rabbi Hanan Schlesinger, a Jewish leader of Roots. They have been on several international tours together, speaking about their stories of personal transformation and building awareness of their efforts to forge reconciliation and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians. When met with criticism for these efforts, especially in regard to speaking with right wing Jews, Awwad responds that dialogue does not start with agreement, but rather is \\"the secure place for argument,\\" adding, \\"If we don't dialogue with the people we disagree with how can we have any solutions.\\" After meeting Awwad, among other Palestinians, Schlesinger underwent a reconfiguration of his political and spiritual self: \\"When you only live among your own and only know your own narrative, you are naturally very suspicious of the other who is just an intruder and just a thorn in your side and something that doesn’t belong there,\\" he says. \\"But when you open up your heart and you see the other, you begin to see the truth is complex – that my truth is true, but it's a partial truth and there's another truth that’s also partial and I have to learn to put them together and make the larger truth. I believe we can do that.\\" David Shulman, who describes him as one of the leaders of a new generation of nonviolent resisters in Palestine, quotes him as arguing: \\"The Jews are not my enemy; their fear is my enemy. We must help them to stop being so afraid – their whole history has terrified them – but I refuse to be a victim of Jewish fear anymore.\\"[15] David Shulman has cited Awwad as one of three exponents of satyagraha active on the West bank, together with Abdallah Abu Rahmah and the Israeli peace activist Ezra Nawi [16]. \\"Some people think that satyagraha [Gandhi's word for nonviolence] is weakness; they believe the angrier you are, the stronger you will be. This is a great mistake. ... You cannot practice nonviolence without listening to the other side's narrative. But first you have to give up being the victim. When you do that, no one will be able to victimize you again\\" [17]. Yet even for Awwad, dialogue work merely scratches the surface of what is required to bring dignity, security, and peace to the Holy Land. Taghyeer, according to him, remains the path forward. \\"Our role is not to dialogue forever. Dialogue is only a carrier from truth to a bigger truth. The bigger truth is what we need to do for peace: not only building a non-violent identity, but creating a mass movement on the ground – where hundreds of thousands of people will come onto the street to force the political leadership to sit and find a solution that we will all benefit from,\\" commenting that the bigger truth is having two truths fit in the land with dignity and freedom.  Political vision  Awwad's speeches often bring up a dichotomy between being right and being successful, his personal preference the latter—a reality he sees materializing through mass political and social pressure: a movement of hundreds of Palestinians that will stand up nonviolently for their rights, and an Israeli mirror to support the cause. According to his political vision, a national framework must be developed for peace: \\"It has to be a national movement on the ground. A national nonviolent movement because peace for us is not to dialogue with Israelis… Dialogue is not a goal for us.\\" In the same Tedx Jerusalem speech, he continues, \\"Peace for us is not to go to five-star peace conferences, where these organizations take their members to feel good with themselves and they eat hummus and hug each other. Peace for us is not to continue a good life. Peace for us is to start living, because we are not alive. … Peace is engagement in normal life conditions,\\" in which human and national rights are in harmony with people's lives.\\" References External links 1972 births Living people Nonviolence advocates Palestinian pacifists Palestinian activists People from Hebron Governorate Date of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ali Abu Awwad"},{"id":"36450003","text":"Jung Su-young (born 17 October 1985) is a Korean handball player for Hanam Handball Club and the Korean national team.2019 World Men's Handball Championship roster He competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics.

He is most known for participating at the 1912 Summer Olympics and for launching the idea for the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link. Løvold started wrestling during his journeyman years while living in Oslo. He joined IF Ørnulf and became Norwegian Champion in Greco-Roman wrestling in 1912. This qualified him to the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, but Løvold lost both his matches in the light heavyweight event. He moved back to Kristiansund in 1913, where he founded a wrestling club and started as an instructor. He also founded wrestling clubs in Molde and Trondheim. As a butcher, he ran several butcher shops in town. From 1951, Løvold dedicated his time to working towards a fixed link for Kristiansund. Early life and professional career Løvold was born on 19 November 1888 in Kristiansund, Norway, as son of Missionary Ole Løvold (1846–1919). Løvold started as a butcher apprentice with his brother B. O. Løvold, before setting out on his journeyman years, where he worked at Bye in Bergen and Axel Jensen in Oslo. He received his trade certificate in 1910. He moved back to Kristiansund in 1913, where he lived for the rest of his life. He married Bergljot, who died in 1958. Løvold established a butcher shop in Storgaten in 1914, which he ran until it was taken over by the municipality in 1917. He then operated various retailing businesses until joining Nordmøre Slakteri. There he was chief of operations until the slaughtering company closed in 1932. He then established Ansgar Kjøtt og Pølseforretning, which at first was located at Nordmør Landbruksforretning butafter two years moved to Massestretet. His store was destroyed in the bombings of the Norwegian Campaign during World War II, although rebuilt after the war. After he retired, the store was taken over by his sons. Sports career It was during the journeyman years in Oslo that Løvold joined organized wrestling. Wrestling in Kristiansund was first introduced by Løvold wrestling at circuses and town fairs. On 8 January 1911 he held a major show against circus artist Erik Blixt, for which Løvold was promised 100 Norwegian krone (NOK) if he won. Although successful, he did not accept the prize money, as it would have made him a professional. He started competing for Fagforeningernes TIF and later IF Ørnulf in Oslo. He represented the latter when he won the 1912 Norwegian championships, thus qualifying him for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. There he participated in the Greco-Roman light heavyweight, but was sent home after losing both his introductory rounds, against Finland's Karl Lind and Austria's Karl Barl. After moving home to Kristiansund in 1913, Løvold was instrumental in establishing a wrestling club. The sport became popular and within a few years all the major sports clubs were offering wrestling. Especially the labor movement's clubs took up the sport, and Kristiansund was quickly known as a wrestling town. Løvold coached several clubs, including IL Nordlandet and Ynglingen. In 1913 he succeeded at getting sponsorships of NOK 300 from various companies throughout town to purchase mats, which was instrumental in making the sport more popular in town. He later became known as a benefactor and sponsor of local wrestling. Kristiansund's first major national tournament was held in 1915 and the first Norwegian Championships in Kristiansund were held in 1922. Løvold also traveled to the neighboring town of Molde to establish a wrestling club there, although wrestling never became as popular in Molde as in Kristiansund. He also established Trondheim's first wrestling club. From 1939, when the labourers' wrestling clubs in Kristiansund merged to form the club Kristiansund AK, Løvold represented this club. Philanthropy Løvold was an active member of Foreningen Kristiansunderen, an organization which worked for the betterment of the town. After seeing The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Løvold started working to build a mermaid statue fountain in Kristiansund. The mermaid statue was never built, although he eventually secured sufficient funding to build a fountain. Løvold traveled to the United States in 1951 to visit his siblings Oscar and Lise in Minnesota, which he had not seen in 42 years. He also visited New York City, where he drove through the Holland Tunnel. On his way home he came in contact with Prime Minister Oscar Torp. Back in Kristiansund, Løvold started working with the idea of building a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland. He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. The local press dubbed him the fixed link general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans. Along with Engineer Gunnar Tonning, Løvold traveled several times to Oslo to meet with national politicians and authorities. In addition to Torp, he consulted the engineering company Aas-Jakobsen, the NATO office and Kolbjørn Varmann, Minister of Transport and Communications. In 1958 a joint municipal and county committee was established to follow up the plans, where Løvold was appointed chairman. Its main function was the ordering seismic surveys of Freifjorden, which gave positive results. Major Worm Eide manned for caution and stated that there was no funding available. Subsequently a committee led by Ole Mollan was appointed, which criticized the original committee for not prioritizing more critical transport investments. During the entire planning and construction of the Tromsø Bridge, Løvold subscribed to both the Tromsø newspapers, Nordlys and Bladet Tromsø, to follow the development. Erling Kjeldsen, who was the main initiator of the Tromsø Bridge, was an inspiration for Løvold. Following in the steps of Tromsø, Løvold established Tunnellforeningen (\\"The Tunnel Association\\"). Its prime goal was to circulate a petition, which received 6,000 signatures—two thirds of the electorate. The organization also featured paroles in the 1961 Constitution Day parade. During the summer, Løvold painted a large, while \\"tunnel entrance\\" on a cliff at Spellmannshaugen as a public relations gimmick. The point he painted was the exact location the Freifjord Tunnel would have its opening. Another organization, Fastlandsforeningen (\\"The Mainland Association\\") was established by Løvold on 27 September 1961. That year another public committee was established, again chaired by Løvold. Løvold died on 12 November 1961 in Kristiansund, 72 years old.

He chose a career in the Royal Navy that spanned a period of history where Great Britain was at the centre of wars and empire building and took him from Boston and the War of Independence to espionage with French Royalists; prisoner of war to shipwrecked; all this whilst hoping to become a Walloon ruler or, at least, heir to a princely fortune.  Early life  Philippe D'Auvergne was born in Jersey, where his family had lived for four centuries. His mother Elizabeth, the daughter of Philip Le Geyt, died giving birth to him. His father, Charles, was an ex-British Army officer, advisor to British Cabinet Committees and aide-de-camp to various Governors; they included John Huske, Governor from 1749 to 1761, who left Charles £2,000 when he died in January 1761. His younger half brother, Corbet James D'Auvergne (born 1767), also joined the Royal Navy, and was associated with Jane Austen. D'Auvergne was educated in Jersey, then England and France. He was fluent in French and English and had a mathematical mind, later to be used in various scientific studies and research. Much of his youth was spent sailing around the coast of Jersey.Balleine, (1973)  Navy  D'Auvergne joined the Royal Navy, and became a midshipman in 1770. He was trained aboard the Royal Yacht , under the command of Captain John Campbell. The Royal Yacht was used as a training vessel, for picked men. This was far easier than the usual training on a man- of-war. Accounts of Philippe's lifeKirke, (1904) put this down to Earl Howe, later Vice Admiral of England and First Lord of the Admiralty. Howe had befriended Charles d'Auvergne, whilst commanding the flotilla stationed at Jersey during 1756. Philippe's next vessel was , where he is reported as meeting Empress Catherine of Russia; and on a return trip was influenced by a French scientific team at Copenhagen. Throughout this time Philippe studied mathematics and tried to solve the problem of time keeping and barometric pressure at sea.Philippe D'Auvergne, An Account of the New Improved Sea- compasses (1789) = Arctic expedition = During 1773, the Admiralty commissioned an expedition to the Arctic, to further science and knowledge. Two sloops were refitted for the expedition and on 4 June 1773The National Archives (United Kingdom): The Racehorse, Captain's Log Book: ADM 51/757 and the Racehorse Master's Log Book: ADM 52/1416 the and set sail for the North. The muster roll for Racehorse lists Philippe d'Auvergne as a midshipman.The National Archives (United Kingdom): HMS Racehorse Muster and Paybook ADM 36/7490 Onboard Carcass was a 15-year-old midshipman, named Horatio Nelson. The expedition failed to find the Northwest Passage, but they had sailed further north than any previous expedition, approximately , a position just north of Svalbard. This and the scientific experiments carried out meant the expedition was a seen as a success.Baron Constantine John Phipps, Voyage towards the North Pole; and Sir Albert Hastings Markham, Northward Ho. During 1774 d'Auvergne continued his scientific education and also prepared sketches for the journal Voyage towards the North Pole by Captain Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave.Kirke, (1904) pp.30–31 = American War of Independence = By 1775 d'Auvergne was assigned to ,The National Archives (United Kingdom): Ship's Paybooks: ADM 34/4 and he is recorded as discharging to on 27 August 1775. Asia was assigned to the fleet at Boston Harbour, to support British forces against the American militia. D'Auvergne, still a midshipman, was ordered to take charge of one of the boats carrying soldiers to attack Lexington. Paul Revere had already warned the Yankees of the attack, resulting in the British force of 800 being reduced by 73 dead and 185 injured by the pursuing American militia. D'Auvergne continued to command boats carrying troops around Boston and on 17 June 1775 after transporting troops, watched the ensuing Battle of Bunker Hill. He was on board one of the ships that bombarded and burnt Falmouth. Appointed acting Lieutenant, D'Auvergne went with the Chatham which landed troops on Long Island, he was commanding a number of flat bottomed boats with hinged gateways, before crossing to Manhattan Island under fire. D'Auvergne was next assigned to , under the command of Admiral Shuldham, commander of the fleet in Boston Harbour. The Admiral was impressed with this young acting Lieutenant and d'Auvergne was commissioned as a Lieutenant on 2 June 1777 and was given , an eight-gun galley, to command.The National Archives (United Kingdom) Colonial Office Correspondence, CO 5/127 On 25 October 1777 d'Auvergne captured the Delaware with a company of Grenadiers;The National Archives (United Kingdom): Colonial Office Correspondence, CO 5/94 and on 27 May 1778 landed a party of marines at Fogland Ferry, successfully destroying the guard house.The National Archives (United Kingdom): Colonial Office Correspondence, CO 5/96 By late 1778 France and Spain had signed a treaty of alliance with the American colonies. When French frigates entered Rhode Island, d'Auvergne carried out his written orders and scuttled Alarm on 30 July 1778. Now ashore, d'Auvergne was made a Major of the Naval Brigade. The court martial of d'Auvergne for the loss of his vessel is reported as being aboard , 28 September 1778. The court martial acquitted d'Auvergne, the British had been forced to scuttle ten vessels in all, including Flora. =Prisoner of war= After returning to England, d'Auvergne was assigned to as First Lieutenant. On 18 March 1779 Arethusa fought the French vessel Aigrette for two hours off Ushant, but during the engagement a larger French line of battle ship was spotted and Arethusa broke off. In the dim light she struck a rock off the coast of Molène. Of the 200 crew, thirteen escaped, apparently never to be seen again, and the remainder were taken prisoner, and interned in Carhaix, Brittany.  Duke of Bouillon  Godefroy Charles Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, the Duke of Bouillon was looking for someone to adopt as the Duke's only surviving son, Jacques Leopold, was seriously disabled and unable to father an heir to the throne. One choice for an heir was a Breton soldier, Théophile Malo Corret, who was an illegitimate half brother to Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne , the Marshal of France. Theophile was from Carhaix and mentioned that a Philippe d'Auvergne was being held prisoner. this chance comment intrigued the Duke, parole was secured and Philippe d'Auvergne travelled in February 1780 to the Château de Navarre in Évreux, Normandy to meet the Duke. He was provided with clothes suitable for a Royal Court and in fluent French told the Duke of his adventures to date. Returned to prison, Philippe d'Auvergne was quickly exchanged and returned to England. The Duke had liked him and hired genealogists to link the Jersey Auvergne's with the French principality.  Further naval duties  D'Auvergne was exchanged with French prisoners of war and returned to England in the spring of 1780, In June he was appointed to . During March 1781 Lark sailed as part of an invasion fleet against the Cape of Good Hope under the command of Commodore George Johnston. They were sent to punish the Dutch for their alliance with the French. On 16 April 1781 the fleet stopped at Porto Praya to take on water and fresh supplies. While the British fleet was at anchor the French fleet, sent to help the Dutch, entered the harbour and attacked the British. After an inconclusive battle the French broke off. After a brief pursuit, Commodore Johnstone chose to stay and make repairs to the damaged ships, enabling the French fleet to reach the Cape first. The British fleet failed to land at the Cape, but they did capture five Dutch East Indiamen in the \\"battle\\" of Saldanha Bay before heading back to England. During this expedition d'Auvergne made a report to Commodore Johnstone of the intelligence that had gathered from her capture on 1 July of the Dutch East Indiaman Heldwoltenlade, which had left Saldanha on 28 June, intelligence that led to the capture of the Dutch ships. Johnstone described d'Auvergne as a \\"very promising young officer\\".The New Annual Register, Or General Repository of History ..., (1781), Vol. 2, p.89. = Trindade and Martim Vaz = D'Auvergne was promoted on 21 August 1781 to Master and Commander and took command of a ten gun cutter , allowing the former captain of Rattlesnake to return to London on Lark. On 30 September, Rattlesnake, , and captured the French ship Philippine. The prize money was remitted from Jamaica, suggesting the capture took place in the Caribbean. French records have the capture occurring in the Antilles. Rattlesnake and were sent to survey Trindade and Martim Vaz, to establish the islands suitability for a base for outward-bound Indiamen. The islands are volcanic with nothing but turtle doves and land crabs.Noted when Edmund Halley placed a Union Jack on the islands in 1700. On the evening of 21 October 1781 during a heavy storm, Rattlesnake lost her anchor rope and in trying to get to sea struck a rock and was run ashore; Jupiter picked up five sailors. Commodore Johnstone had previously wished to colonise the island and claim it for Britain, so d'Auvergne agreed to stay on the tiny island with 30 sailors, 20 captured French sailors, one woman, some animals and supplies. A supply ship arrived in January 1782 and the news of Rattlesnakes loss arrived in England on 5 February.Lloyd's List №1333. Then the castaways appear to have been forgotten. d'Auvergne and his people remained on the island until 27 December 1782, when by chance, , escorting East Indiamen, passed by. d'Auvergne fired distress signals and she rescued the 30 sailors, 20 Frenchmen, and the woman.The National Archives (United Kingdom) Log Book, ADM 51/137 D'Auvergne and the surviving crew were taken to Madras, India. A second Court Martial took place regarding the loss of Rattlesnake and d'Auvergne was absolved of any liability for the loss and commended for the most extraordinary command he had been given by a superior. =India= Whilst in India D'Auvergne met Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot. Muhammed had gone into debt helping the British against the French. This caused the British East India Company to claim most of his state, claiming an annual income from the Nawab. The Nawab asked d'Auvergne to make a petition to the King to reclaim his state. D'Auvergne, on his return, made the petitionA petition of the claim is held by the Société Jersiaise in 1783. The petition was successful and the state returned to the Nawab. It was reported that D'Auvergne married whilst in India, but the India Office Records held by the British Library have no record of a marriage. Although there is a marriage of a Philip d'Auvergne to an Anne Lowrie in 1800, the individual in question was a captain in the army.Philippe d'Auvergne was in Jersey at this time. =Peace= On his return to England d'Auvergne was promoted to Post-captain, but the peace with France meant demobilisation. Between 1784 and 1787 d'Auvergne spent time travelling and escorted John Townsend son of Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney on a Grand Tour. D'Auvergne obtained an honorary degree in 1785 and elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 11 June 1786. In 1787 he was appointed a Revenue officer in Jersey, on board , a post he continued in until 1789 when he asked to be relieved due to ill health. The Duke du Bouillon had now found a way to connect the families, using the reported arrival of the d'Auvergne family in the Channel Islands during the 13th century. In the 14th century Thiébaut d'Auvergne obtained a grant of land in Jersey and the family remained there until the 18th century. In 1787 the adoption was agreed by King George and notices were published in the London Gazette. D'Auvergne was now known as the Prince of Bouillon, and would be Duke of Bouillon if Jacques Léopold de La Tour d'Auvergne died without issue. With this new title came an offer of French naturalisation, d'Auvergne rejected this offer, stating he would never betray his sovereign.In records held by Société Jersiaise. D'Auvergne visited the Duke in 1790 and found the Duke had married the 14-year-old daughter of his mistress. If this new wife produced a boy, d'Auvergne would not inherit. However, the Duke was not well and officially confirmed d'Auvergne as the Prince-Successor, which George III confirmed on 27 February 1792. The Supreme Council of Bouillon, did not confirm the appointment, stating it did not comply with French law; this would have future consequences. During this period d'Auvergne also assisted Channel Island merchants in securing convoys for their shipping.The National Archives (United Kingdom) Foreign Office correspondence: FO 95  French Revolution  In 1793, at the beginning of the French Revolution, d'Auvergne was based in London. The Governor of Jersey Alexander Lindsay had opened communications between England and the Royalists. Lindsay was then transferred to Jamaica in 1794. = Administrateur des Secours Accordés aux Émigrés (Administrator of Relief Grants to Emigres) = By 1794, after a petition from the Defence Committee of the Islands, and a letter from d'Auvergne to the Admiralty, he was appointed as commander of the floating battery and Senior of Officer of Gunboats in Jersey. Several gunboats formed his flotilla: , , , and . The ships were not purpose-built men of war, but rather small former Dutch hoys converted to gun-vessels. The crew were mainly from Jersey, as Englishmen did not want to serve on them, there being little opportunity for prize money. Merchants and locals on Jersey provided the money to defray the extra costs to support the flotilla. The vessels were not effective and the Navy withdrew them, selling most. Nonesuch was paid off in December 1794, but the Navy replaced her with the 16-gun floating battery , which the Navy re-rated as a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate to increase d'Auvergne's salary as her commander and commander of the flotilla. To replace the hoys, d'Auvergne received the services of the hired armed vessels Daphne, Royalist, and Aristocrat.The commander of Aristocrat was Lieutenant Corbet James d'Auvergne. With this responsibility d'Auvergne was asked, in September 1794, to assume the role Alexander Lindsay had started. A manuscript memorial to the War Office, held by the Library in Jersey, shows his duties as: * To command a division of armed vessels to cover the Islands. * Open communications with the continent, to obtain information on hostile enemy movements. * Maintain communications with the insurgents in Western Provinces. * To distribute succours (sic; assistance) to the lay French emigrants in the Islands. In addition to his government duties, d'Auvergne distributed £122,031 of non-government monies to thousands of émigrés who had fled through Jersey, obtaining receipts for every penny spent and passing an audit with praise. He also established a school for the émigré children. =Spymaster in revolutionary era= sols Provided with £30,000 a month by the secret service of the British government to use to cause unrest in France and to whom he reported directly, the communications with the French Royalists was maintained by a network of spies, and insurgents whilst smuggling arms, ammunition and supplies across the short stretch of water to the French mainland. The authorities in Jersey were suspicious of d'Auvergne who was reporting directly to London and of the émigrés in Jersey at a time of threatened invasion, émigrés were required to wear a white ribbon and obey a curfew. Jersey was an excellent base for d'Auvergne, who erected on a tower, the Prince's tower as it became called, that he had owned since 1754 at La Hougue Bie, a signal station, the masts of which could be clearly seen from the French coast. The smuggling of people with forged documents and materiel into France together with forged French Assignat notes, which were being mass-produced in London with the successful result of causing hyperinflation which raged in France until 1802. From 1795 he was given complete access to Mont Orgueil castle as a base, this reinforced Gorey harbour as the base for the ships d'Auvergne used to transport people and goods to France, messages were sometimes routed for/from French fishermen through secure drops on isolated rocks or in a lobster pot. Not only was d'Auvergne involved in the administration of French Emigres who had flocked to Jersey and passing intelligence to London, he also supported the attempted invasion at Quiberon. British and émigré forces landed at Quiberon to support the Chouans and the French Royalist and Catholic Armies on 21 July 1795. The invading force was led by General Comte Joseph de Puisaye. Puisaye was under the command of Comte D'Artois of the House of Bourbon, whilst his second in command, Louis Charles d'Hervilly, was under the command of Louis XVIII, of the House of Orleans. The invasion started well, the forces landed without incident and they had the element of surprise, but d'Hervilly produced a letter to take command of the force. This fight for command, Puisaye won eventually, allowed the French Republican forces to counterattack and the Royalist forces were forced to retreat. An intercepted report stated that all the men from Quiberon (approximately 750 men) were executed at Auray, these were mainly nobles of Louis XVIII.The National Archives (United Kingdom) Foreign Office correspondence: FO 95/605/19 A chapel now stands on the site, known as Champ des Martyrs. General Puisaye was accused of desertion. Neither d'Auvergne nor the Comte de Puisaye seem to have trusted each other,The National Archives (United Kingdom) War Office correspondence: WO 1/921 with Puisaye trying to avoid Jersey, and deliver directly to London. d'Auvergne continued to ask Henry Dundas if he should send arms to Puisaye. After Puisaye returned to Jersey he retired from the military and headed for Canada. A regular visitor to Jersey was Georges Cadoudal, the Chouan leader implicated in an attempt on Christmas Eve 1800 to assassinate Napoleon Bonaparte, in rue Saint-Nicaise Paris. A barrel of gunpowder concealed in a water cart was detonated as Bonaparte's carriage went by, but it was ignited too late, and the First Consul was only showered with broken glass.  Claims to the throne of Bouillon  = First claim to throne of Bouillon = The Prince's Tower, d'Auvergne's gothic residence, as depicted by Philip John Ouless in 1855 D'Auvergne lost the command of Jersey with the peace with France. His role was a wartime role, with peace came a Captain's half pay. He now spent his time in his house and gardens on Jersey, even opening the gardens to the public. His library contained 4,000 volumes, from scientific to classic, to French history. From 1792 he developed a neo-Gothic construction at La Hougue Bie known as the Prince's Tower. The mediaevalist architecture of the tower (originally to be called La Tour d'Auvergne as a symbolic motif of his adopted family name) supported both his claims to ancestry and his interest in fashionable architecture of the day. His promotions raised him to Vice Admiral of the Red. In Bouillon the French had annexed the Duchy of Bouillon in 1795, and Duke Godefroy III, died in 1794, his son Jacques Leopold La Tour d'Auvergne inherited the title of Duke. Jacques Leopold died on 3 March 1802 without issue, and Philippe d'Auvergne used the full title and dignity of Duke after this date. After the Peace of Amiens on 25 March 1802, d'Auvergne headed to Paris to fight a claim by another apparent heir, but on his arrival, the French police, knowing of his actions in Jersey, dragged him from his hotel without any charge, or any explanation and threw him in jail. Correspondence from Mr Merry, Ambassador in Paris, complains of the French authorities actions and states that d'Auvergne was held for five days, and when released was given only 24 hours to leave France, a near impossibility at that time.The National Archives (United Kingdom) Foreign Office correspondence: FO 27/64 Questions were raised in Parliament, but no further action was taken as they did not wish to upset the latest peace.Parliamentary Papers Online (subscription website) = Spymaster in Napoleonic era = D'Auvergne returned to Jersey. By 1802 the émigrés had been given a way to return home, as Napoleon Bonaparte had taken control of France, and granted the émigrés amnesty. Many signed the declaration offered and returned. D'Auvergne continued to collect intelligence from France, including the buildup of forces at Brest, where Bonaparte was massing a force to assist the Irish in their fight against the British. D'Auvergne's ring of spies was diminishing as either they were captured, or signed Napoleon's declaration. In 1803 he was given a 44-gun Adventure-class frigate to reinforce Jersey defences, however it was wrecked next year in a gale. Some of the spies continued to travel across the sea to France, and one was Noel Prigent, experienced in landing in France; he had journeyed across the sea over 150 times. In 1807 d'Auvergne was informed of the Chouans wanting to rise and rebel again, so Prigent and companions were sent to France to gain intelligence. On their arrival they found no signs of a possible uprising or even anyone willing to assist them. All the usual safe houses were closed to them. Prigent and his companions spent a number of weeks travelling around Brittany and living in ditches, and after a number of failed attempts to return to Jersey, one of the companions, Bouchard, gave himself up to the French. Bouchard then led the Secret Police to Prigent and his companions. As soon as Prigent was captured, he gave up every detail he knew about the correspondence, including landing places, codes and safe houses used by d'Auvergne's spies. Bouchard then agreed to return to Jersey and persuade d'Auvergne that he was sent by Prigent. D'Auvergne welcomed him and sent Bouchard back to France with letters to General Puisaye, and further correspondence to Prigent. Bouchard had asked that Comte Vaucouleurs be despatched to France, and shortly afterwards he left for the French coast. He was arrested as soon as he landed. Armand de Chateaubriand followed in September 1808, but it was apparent that everyone was behind Napoleon. No-one would support Chateaubriand, and after a couple of failed attempts to return to Jersey, Chateaubriand was arrested and along with 10 other émigrés was shot. The efforts of Bouchard and Prigent to save their own lives also failed, as they were shot on Bonaparte's orders. Even the Comte d'Artois was indicating he should have sole control of the correspondence.The National Archives (United Kingdom) War Office correspondence: WO 1/922 Any hope of a new Royalist revolution was never going to materialise. 1808 saw d'Auvergne promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral and put in charge of naval ships in the Channel Islands although as he was not afloat, could not benefit from prize monies. In 1809 Napoleon confirmed an order to confiscate all assets of the Bouillon family, granting d'Auvergne's Château de Navarre to his divorced wife, Josephine. Promoted to Vice-Admiral, d'Auvergne stood down from his role in 1812, possibly due to ill health, possibly aware of the next period of peace and put on half pay. = Second claim to the throne of Bouillon = In 1814 the Comte d'Artois of the House of Bourbon, was proclaimed King Louis XVIII, and when d'Auvergne visited him in Paris, agreed to support d'Auvergne's claim to the Duchy of Bouillon, for all the support he had given to the Royalists over the last 20 years. The officials of the Duchy taking an oath to d'Auvergne as the 8th Duc de Bouillon and he was formally declared Prince of Bouillon. On hearing Napoleon had returned, d'Auvergne went to Brussels, he marched to war with a small regiment formed in the colours of Bouillon, where nine days before the Battle of Waterloo, d'Auvergne discovered that the Treaty of Paris which had left the Congress of Vienna to rewrite the map of Europe, had decided to form a buffer state, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, along the border of France. This meant there was no place for an independent principality and the Duchy would be part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Although the Duchy was lost, the right to the estates in France, however further complications came in the form of another claimant to the throne, Prince Charles de Rohan, a grandson of a half-sister of the old Duke. Things looked good as d'Auvergne had the backing of Lord Castlereagh, and the Congress had rejected a similar case. with everyone watching Waterloo, the Congress decided the King of the Netherlands should rule on the case, and left the ruling to the arbitrators and the King and whilst d'Auvergne was away, Congress decided to uphold the claim by Rohan, the blood relation.  Death  Philippe d'Auvergne returned to London, the security for his personal loans having been lost, he was bankrupt, owing £12,000 in Jersey alone. He committed suicide at Holmes' Hotel, London, on 18 September 1816; he was buried in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster. An inventory of his house and library from the auction of his estate are held by the Jersey Archives. The Duchy of Bouillon remained in upheaval until 1825 when it was divided between the last Duke of Bourbon, the Prince de La Trémoille and the Princesse de Poix. Philippe d'Auvergne died with the titles: * Monsignor His Serene Highness Philippe d'Auvergne, by the Grace of God and the will of his people, Duc de Bouillon. * Vicomte de Turenne. * Duc d'Albert and de Chateau Thierry. * Comte d'Auvergne. * Comte d'Évreux et du bas Armagnac. * Baron de la Tour, Oliergues, Maringues and Montgacon, Peer of France. Most of these titles died with him. Descendants D'Auvergne fathered three illegitimate children by Mary Hepburn of St. Helier, Jersey, to whom he gave his name: Mary Ann Charlotte (b. 1794), married in 1815 to Sir Henry Prescott, later Admiral; Anne Elizabeth (b. 1800), married to Admiral John Aplin; and Philip, who died a midshipman aboard at Colombo in 1815, and was buried 19 March 1815 at St Peters (\\"The Fort\\").According to the burial register, cited in Notes, references and bibliography ;Notes ;References ;Bibliography * Ashelford, Jane (2008) In the English Service, the life of Phillippe d'Auvergne, Jersey Heritage Trust, * Balleine, George Reginald (1973) The tragedy of Philip d'Auvergne, Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy and last duke of Bouillon.

Sri Chand, also referred to as Baba Sri Chand (8 September 1494 – 13 January 1629), was the founder of the ascetic sect of Udasi and was the elder son of Guru Nanak, first Guru and founder of Sikhism. He was born to Mata Sulakhani on Bhadra sudi 9, 1551 Bikrami (i.e. 8 September 1494). Relationship with Sikh Gurus Not much is known about the relationship of Guru Angad and Sri Chand.

Cunningham,Joseph A History of the Sikhs However the Sikh Gurus, Guru Amardas, Guru Ramdas, Guru Arjan and Guru Hargobind who were also contemporaries of Sri Chand did revere him. Guru Harigobind's eldest son, Baba Gurditta, was given to the Udasis at the behest of Baba Sri Chand's request and Baba Gurditta eventually replaced Baba Sri Chand as head of the Udasis after his death. Baba Gurditta was the father of Guru Hari Rai, the grandfather of Guru Hari Krishan and the elder half-brother of Guru Tegh Bahadur. Ram Rai, son of Guru Har Rai joined Udasi sect after a failed attempt of being an official eighth Guru of the Sikhs.

Background  Bagber is a village under the Kalyanpur police station in West Tripura district of Tripura. It is located in West Ghilatali, approximately 1 km from the police station. In May 2000, during the ongoing ethnic riots scores of Bengali Hindus had taken shelter at a refugee camp in Bagber. The camp was located at the Niranjan Sardarpara Senior Basic School.  Events  On 20 May, at around 5 P.M. in the afternoon a heavily armed group of around 60 NLFT militants raided the Bagber village. They hurled grenade at the house of Ajoy Ghose, the local CPI(M) leader. At the news of the attack, the refugees who had taken shelter adjacent to the Niranjan Sardarpara School, began to flee towards Kanchanpur. Seeing the refugees fleeing, the NLFT militants turned their guns on them. Three refugees were killed instantly. The militants then targeted the inmates at the refugee camp, where they killed sixteen and injured several others. The CRPF personnel deployed at Bagber didn't protest when the massacre took place. 19 Bengali Hindus were killed on the spot and several others were critically injured in the massacre. Six of them succumbed to their injuries later.  Aftermath  On 21 May, at around 11 A.M. in the morning, suspected NLFT rebels killed three Bengali Hindus at Ratia-Durgapur under Kalyanpur police station. After that the rebels set fire to several houses. 333 families were relocated from five Gram Panchayats of Kalyanpur after the massacre and settled in Amar Colony under North Kalyanpur Gram Panchayat. Each of the families were promised 24 tins and 2,000 rupees cash to build their homes. However, they were not entitled to avail any loan from the North Kalyanpur Gram Panchayat.

He served the emperors Constantius II, Julian, Jovian and Valens. He was appointed consul in 372 alongside Domitius Modestus. He served under Constantius during his campaign against the Alemanni, 354–5, under Julian in his Persian campaign, 363, and under Valens in the First Gothic War, 367–9, and Armenia, 370. He was one of the clique of senior officers who elected Jovian to the throne, and may have played a similar role in the election of Valentinian. He died in 378 while serving as magister peditum, one of the two most senior military positions of the Roman Empire. Early career Arinthaeus began his career as a military officer. In 354–5 Arinthaeus served as a tribune, a middle-ranking officer, in Raetia.Martindale & Jones, pg. 102 He belonged to one of the legions which accompanied Emperor Constantius II on his campaign against the Alemanni, where Arinthaeus was instrumental in securing a victory against the enemy in difficult circumstances.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, Book XV, 4:10 In 355 Constantius elevated his cousin Julian to the rank of caesar with authority over the Western Empire.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae XV.8.5–16 Meanwhile, Arinthaeus rose through the ranks, becoming a civilian court official under Constantius.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, Book XXV, 5:2 In 360 Julian revolted and proclaimed himself emperor. In 361, taking advantage of a pause in the ongoing war against the Sassanid Persian Empire, Constantius marched against Julian. Arinthaeus accompanied Constantius, but shortly after setting out the forty- four year-old Emperor died of natural causes and civil war was averted.Lenski, pg. 14 Arinthaeus is next mentioned in AD 363, as a comes rei militaris, a senior military position. He accompanied the new emperor on his Persian campaign. Julian had gathered an army of 65,000 men, and advanced into the heart of Persian territory. Arinthaeus was put in charge of the cavalry on the left wing during the advance into Mesopotamia, responsible for screening the main army from the Persians. He repulsed at least one attack by the Persians during this part of the campaign.Boeft, pg. xix He commanded an infantry force during Julian’s victory outside the walls of the Persian capital Ctesiphon. Afterwards he led his forces in ravaging the countryside and pursuing what Persians he could find.Martindale & Jones, pgs. 102–103; Boeft, pg. xxi As the city was considered impregnable Julian moved north, aiming to join up with a large Roman detachment commanded by Procopius and Sebastianus. Julian was mortally wounded in a skirmish. Map showing Julian's campaign of 363 Arinthaeus and a number of other court officials who had served under Constantius began looking among their number for a replacement, but were opposed by the officers who had served under Julian in the west. Eventually the joint officers, including Arinthaeus, agreed to the elevation of Saturninius Salutius. Salutius was the Praetorian Prefect of the East, second only to the Emperor in this area, and had been a senior advisor to both Constantius and Julian. Salutius refused, on the grounds of old age and a lack of military experience. The sources are unclear as to what happened next; there is a suggestion that the impatient junior officers forced the hand of their seniors, even that the throne was mistakenly offered to an officer with a similar name to the one intended. In any event, Arinthaeus and the other commanders, deep in enemy territory and attempting a difficult retreat, agreed on Flavius Jovianus, a tribune of the Palace Guard, who became the Emperor Jovian. Jovian kept much of Julian’s senior staff intact, and Arinthaeus retained his position. The army continued to retreat but ran short of supplies and was trapped by the Persians on the wrong bank of the Tigris at Dura. Jovian sent Arinthaeus and Salutius to negotiate a truce with the Sassanid emperor, Shapur II. The negotiations lasted four days, and saw Arinthaeus and Salutius agree a treaty whereby the Romans gave up five satrapies on the eastern side of the Tigris River, and abandoned control of eastern Mesopotamia, including the vital border fortress of Nisibis.Lenski, pgs. 161–163 Rome also abandoned its ally Armenia.Lenski, pgs. 164–165 In exchange, the Roman army was supplied and assisted on its way and Jovian was recognised as Roman emperor. On their way back from the east, Jovian dispatched Arinthaeus to Gaul, where he was ordered to confirm Jovinus as the Magister equitum, or senior military commander.Martindale & Jones, pg. 103 Service under Valens Jovian died before reaching Constantinople, the Roman capital. The army's commanders gathered again, at Nicaea, with civilian officials from the capital. It is not known if Arinthaeus was present at this meeting, but he supported its choice, Valentinian I.Lenski, pg. 21 He was transferred to the court of Valentinian’s brother and co-emperor, Valens, at Constantinople. Valens immediately moved east to make a show of force to any Persians tempted to take advantage of the imperial confusion. Arinthaeus went with him. Part way to the border they learnt that ex-general Procopius had proclaimed himself rightful emperor and seized the capital. Valens was shaken and considered abdication and perhaps even suicide. Most of his troops had already crossed into Syria when he learned of the revolt, which allowed Procopius to gain control of the provinces of Asia and Bithynia, winning increased support for the insurrection. Valens reappointed Sallustius, and dispatched the available legions under veteran generals Arinthaeus and Arbitio to march on Procopius.Gibbon, p. 852, 853 On the border of Bithynia and Galatia Arinthaeus confronted an army commanded by Hyperechius, an ally of Procopius, and convinced his troops to abandon Procopius. Procopius fled, but was soon captured and executed. Valens appointed Arinthaeus Magister peditum, a senior military position, which he held until his death.Martindale & Jones, pg. 103; Lenski, pg. 79 Emperor Valens Arinthaeus then accompanied Valens during the First Gothic War from 367 to 369. In 368 he was dispatched to harass the Thervingi in Gothia, with his soldiers rewarded with a gold coin for every barbarian head they brought back.Lenski, pg. 128 The following year Arinthaeus was asked to negotiate a peace with King Athanaric of the Goths, and was then promptly dispatched to the Persian frontier.Lenski, pg. 133 After spending the end of 369 and early 370 repairing the road between Amaseia and Satala, he marched into Armenia with an armed force to re-install Papas (Pap) on the throne of Armenia. Shapur II had invaded Armenia shortly before, but Arinthaeus was able to force him out with little fighting, and to curtail Papas’ attempts to come to an agreement with the Sassanid emperor. Arinthaeus remained in Armenia throughout 371.Lenski, pg. 173; Martindale & Jones, pg. 103 During the following year Arinthaeus was appointed consul, serving alongside Domitius Modestus. Becoming a consul was the highest honour of the Roman state, and as such candidates were chosen carefully by the emperor. It is notable that one of the consuls who preceded him was the son of Emperor Valentinian and that the pair of consuls for the following year were the co- emperors Valentinian and Valens.Martindale et al, pg. 605–8 In 377 magister peditum Traianus fought a bloody and inconclusive battle against the Goths known as the Battle of the Willows. Valens accused Traianus of cowardice, but thanks to the support of Arinthaeus and Magister Equitum Victor, Traianus was able to put the blame on Valens' persecution of the Nicenians.Ammianus Marcellinus, XXXI VIII,3. Arinthaeus died in 378. He was baptised a Christian on his deathbed. He was married and had at least one daughter. He was a correspondent of Basil of Caesarea, also called Saint Basil the Great. As a supporter of Orthodox Christianity he was alleged to have confronted the emperor Valens over his Arianism. See also * Gothic War (376–382) Footnotes =References= * Boeft, J.

Since the beginning to the present day the main musical direction for the group has been heavy metal. The band sticks to the 1980s style. In addition, one can trace the influence and identify the components of such styles as speed metal, power metal, hard rock, techno thrash and some other styles in the music of Holy Dragons. The band recorded its first full-length album, Dragon Steel, in 1998. Since 2003, the band began to work with the Russian record label Metalism Records, some of the albums were released in cooperation with Soyuz Music, Metal Agen, Sound Age, etc. In 2009, the band released the album Iron Mind as a free downloadable Internet release. Currently the group is working with independent label Pitch Black Records, based in Cyprus.Label rosters History =Formation= Holy Dragons as a band were formed in 1992 in the then capital city of Almaty (since 1997 Astana has replaced Almaty as a capital of Kazakhstan). The bands creation date is considered to be 11 September 1992 when guitarist Jurgen Thunderson got together the first line-up with the singer Oleg \\"Holger\\" Komaroff, to make music in the style of hard rock and heavy metal. During the first years, the group was called \\"Axcess\\", which later was changed into its current name in 1997. The participants of the first line-up were: Bulat Sadvakassov – lead guitar, Marat Sadvakassov – drums and Roman \\"Africa\\" Cubashev (bass guitar). Under this name, the band recorded multiple demo tapes, which were distributed primarily through re-recording from one tape to another with a tape recorder among friends. Axcess – \\"In Magic Kingdom\\" (1992), Axcess (pre-Holy Dragons) – \\"Прыгни в Ад!\\" (\\"Jump into Hell\\") (1992), Axcess (pre-Holy Dragons) – \\"Дубовые Мозги\\" (\\"Oaken Brains\\") (1993) – most of the songs from those early demos later entered the licensed albums. The band started stylistically experimenting in lots of different metal genres and they became one of, if not the first metal band Kazakhstan had produced. Since that time, the line-up has undergone considerable changes with Thunderson remaining the sole constant member as a founder. =\\"Axcess\\" years (1992–1995)= Gradually, line-up was changed, Cubashev left the band to make his own reggae-project \\"Люди Солнца\\" (\\"People of the Sun\\"). He was replaced by bassist Denis Kozlov, playing on the bass-guitar and electronic organ. By mid-1993, the existing staff fell apart. Jürgen continues his musical career as a part of Izverg\\" (kaz), which played death metal at that time, and in a blues-rock \\"Benn Gunn Band\\", and Holger finds himself in the heavy metal band \\"Cerberus\\", where, however, his participation was occasional, and he started to be engaged in his own group of \\"Project Minstrel\\". In 1994, the group gathers back again, with new recruits Veniamin Polovinko – bass guitar and Slava Greechenco – drums (ex-\\"Benn Gunn Band\\"), joined by Holger Komaroff. Two months after the start of the rehearsals, the group recorded a rehearsal demo Axcess – \\"Genocide\\", which included five tracks. After the recording of the demo, live performances and participation in local rock festivals at the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995, the group splits. Jürgen continues to work as a part of the project \\"Heder\\", Holger goes to \\"Project Figaro\\". Greechenko and Polovinko – to \\"Benn Gunn Band\\" and \\"Deathrack\\" respectively. =Reformation (1995–1997)= By mid-1995, Jürgen decided to revive the group under a different name. Enlisting the support of a guitarist known under the pseudonym Chris \\"Thorheim\\" Caine (ex-\\"GB-5\\", \\"Lamia\\"), the newly formed group was looking for new members, as well as for the support from the former members of the group. This period was marked by a very brief participation of Veniamin Polovinko, and then Lekmar. Holger briefly appeared again only to disappear for a few years very soon. There were a lot of session drummers and other members of the group, coming and going at that period.According to the official Eventually, the first demo album (under the \\"Holy Dragons\\" name), 8 songs demo \\"Halloween Night\\", was recorded in 1996, which was later developed into their debut album, Dragon Steel in 1998. By 1997, with somewhat stable line-up (Anders \\"Caban\\" Kraft – vocals (ex- Beermaht, Holy Inquisition (kz)), Marina \\"Gill Sheffield\\" Mikhailova – bass guitar (ex-\\"Lamia\\", \\"GB-5\\", \\"Green Low\\"), the group becomes known as the Holy Dragons. Under that name the band goes into enters the studio for the first studio recordings and gives live performances. At that time the band recorded the first licensed album – \\"Dragon Steel\\" (an earlier version of the album, with Anders Kraft vocals), which was released in Kazakhstan by \\"Studio Iris\\" in the tape format. It took the band only 28 hours of studio time. For the promotion purposes the band presented two most successful tracks from the album in the form of a single, called \\"Wild Cat\\". The band (although vocalist Anders \\"Caban\\" Kraft wasn't very much accepted by foreign listeners), showed solid heavy metal on this album. Perhaps it was the first complete recording of an album of the metal band from Kazakhstan (except for demo records), which has been available outside the country. \\"Dragon Steel\\" became the first and last release for Anders \\"Caban\\" Kraft, bassist Gill Sheffield and drummer Simon, who were replaced by Daniel \\"Dan\\" Thorne, Steven Dreico and Seva Sabbath respectively. Later, vocals for this album were rewritten for CD format release with a new singer, who became Daniel \\"Dan\\" Throne. =The english-lyrics \\"classic\\" line-up (1998–2001)= Meanwhile, there were changes in the line-up again. There came and then left a keyboardist Konstantin Baev, then vocalist Anders \\"Caban\\" Kraft leaves and creates a band\\"Tornado\\" (kaz) (later joins– \\"Seduser Embrace\\" as a bass guitarist). The band starts to search for a new singer and there have been a lot of people, who went through the band, people like Tatiana \\"Gliuk\\" Gemashova and others. Despite the frequent changes in the line-up, the band recorded a demo \\"Knights of the Kamelot\\" with Jurgen vocal's, many songs from which were subsequently overwritten on the albums to follow, such as \\"Thunder in the Night\\" and \\"Judgment Day\\". Shortly after the recording is finished, Gill Sheffield left, and by the middle of July 1998 there came Daniel \\"Dan\\" Throne – vocals (ex-\\"Wooсk\\") and Steven Dreico – bass guitar (ex-\\"Wooсk\\"). The band overwrites the vocal lines on Dragon Steel (this version of the album became a cassette compilation \\"The Best\\"), released by Kazakhstan Fair Play studio in 1999. In 2008, the album was released by CD Russian label \\"Metalism Records\\". By the end of the year, the group was joined by Alex – (drums, ex-\\"Deathrack\\"). The year 1999 was mega-effective for the band. In 1999 the band gave a lot of live performances, starred in the TV show, wrote half an hour live video for the TV- program \\"City Jazz, City Blues\\", then recorded an album \\"Rock Ballads / Dragon Ballads\\" – consisting entirely of ballads, 8 songs, some of them were included into the compilation album \\"The Best\\" and some of them were also released as a bonus track to the earlier versions of CD- edition of \\"Judgment Day\\" and \\"Gotterdammerung\\", and a little later – \\"House of The Winds\\" (album, which is based on the songs composed in the 90s). \\"Rock Ballads/Dragon Ballads,\\" spawned a music video for the song, \\"Christmas Time,\\" and was released independently, as was their third album, \\"House of the Winds\\" in 1999. It was published in 2001 as a part of a cassette box set \\"Rage of the Dragon Lords\\". Later, in 2004 re- mastered album version (2004, \\"Obitel Vetrov\\"), with Russian-lyrics Holger Komaroff vocals was released on CD by \\"Metalism Records\\" in cooperation with the \\"Soyuz Music\\" and \\"Metalagen\\". All this activity was combined with concerts and even work \\"in the club format.\\" Also in 1999, the band creates a website and puts their freshest album at that time, \\"House of the Winds\\" for free download in MP-3 format. In 2000 \\"Thunder in the Night\\" was recorded. At this point, the drummer had left the band and Thunderson handled the drums himself. It was certainly a much more polished representation of the band, with far better art work and a shorter track listing of more polished songs. In the same year Holy Dragons signed a contract with a Polish PR agency, Dragonight Records to release their fourth album, \\"Thunder in the Night\\" on the CD and TAPE versions, a limited edition. (источник 3 – официальный сайт группы) Later, in 2004 re- mastered version of this album (2004, \\"Polunochniy Grom\\") with Russian-lyrics Holger Komarov vocals was released on CD by \\"Metalism Records\\" in cooperation with the \\"Soyuz Music\\" and \\"Metalagen\\". The drums on the album were recorded by Jürgen Thunderson. The record contained some solid production work which represented a much clearer sound than some of their previous work, which was brought up soon after this album's release via a compilation album entitled, \\"Rage of the Dragon Lords\\", only the next year. The beginning of 2001 was a time of discord and misunderstanding for the band. Instead of the next album, the band recorded a Russian-lyrics single \\"Strannik Zvezd\\" and partly English-lyrics demo \\"Warlock\\", which becomes the last work of Daniel Throne as a vocalist. Despite the local success, a compilation \\"Rage of the Dragon Lords\\" issued by the Kazakh studio Fair Play, which was a box set with which included albums \\"House of the Winds\\", \\"Thunder in the Night\\" and the single \\"Strannik Zvezd\\", it was impossible to stop the collapse of the band. On December 22d in 2001, Daniel \\"Dan\\" Throne and Steven Dreico leave the band. Briefly Jurgen gets to the microphone stand and a new bass guitar member comes, Muha Fly (bass guitar, backing vocals, ex-\\"Iron Cross\\" (kaz)) – but it didn't improve the situation. That same year, an EP, \\"Warlock\\" was released before their next album, \\"Judgment Day\\", recorded in 2002, being released in January 2003. =Russian-lyrics line-up. \\"The Komaroff era\\" (2002–2009)= Soon Muha Fly leaves the group. The entire 2002 the rest of the band remained busy working on the next album. The basics of this work consisted in the re-written tracks from the \\"Halloween Night\\", \\"Knights of the Kamelot\\", \\"Warlock\\", and some new material. \\"Judgment Day\\" marked the beginning of the Russian language period in the history of the band and also saw the debut of the new old singer, Holger Komaroff, as well as their first full length as a trio, following the departure of Steven Dreico, though second guitarist Chris Caine remained. By the end of summer a new bass player Chris \\"Kuzmitch\\" Larson joines the band (being the member of the \\"Black Fox\\" (kaz)) and the new-old singer Oleg \\"Holger\\" Komaroff. The first rehearsal of the new line-up is held on September, 16 and already a month later, the group sends the album materials to the newly formed Moscow label \\"Metalism Records\\", which decided to release the album, together with the \\"giant\\" of the Russian music industry \\"Soyuz Music\\". In 2003 CD appears on the shelves, and in 2006 the second edition of the album with new artwork, re-mixing and digital re- mastering with 20-page booklet was released. The work on the musical material was in full swing on the Russian version of the old material and new songs. At the beginning of 2003 there is a change of drummers and the group was joined by Yurii Morev (being the member of \\"Phoenix\\" (kaz)). The band recorded the album with the original title in German \\"Gotterdammerung\\" (known also under the name of \\"Sumerki Bogov\\" (\\"Twilight of the Gods\\"), the label translated the album title without informing the band about it.The album was released in the same year at \\"Metalism Records\\" in cooperation with the \\"Soyuz Music\\" as CD-format. In 2005 it was re-released with the new artwork and digital re-mastering with 20-page booklet. The work continues. In the same year, 2003 the band recorded three English-language versions of the songs from the album \\"Gotterdammerung\\" – which make up a demo-single called \\"Blood Of Elves\\", but because of the reaction of the English-speaking public for a very strong accent of Holger, this activity was stopped. That same year, the group took part in the first in Kazakhstan CD- collection dedicated to the local rock scene – \\"Underground KZ\\", pt.1 – in 2003 with the songs \\"Blood of Elves\\" and \\"Twilight of the Gods\\". On 31 October 2004 \\"Metalism Records\\" in cooperation with the \\"Soyuz Music\\" and \\"MetalAgen\\" releases two band CDs \\"Obitel Vetrov\\" and \\"Polunochniy Grom\\" – the Russian-language version of the albums of 1999 and 2000 – \\"House of the Winds\\" and \\"Thunder in the Night\\" respectively. The band began recording their next album, but despite active studio and concert work, even at the regional level, on 28 October 2004, Morev and Larsson left the band. In 2005 marked the group non-concert status and the release of the album \\"Wolves of Odin\\" (released by the \\"Metalism Records\\") in the speed- metal 80th style. Only in 2006 the complete line –up was formed when the band was joined by Anton Repalo and Andrey Evseenko (both – former \\"Otrajenie\\"). In the same year, \\"Metalism Records\\" releases another album, a conceptual \\"Black Moon Rising\\". The song \\"Tengri\\" from the album was included into the collection of the magazine \\"Salon AV\\" – \\"Ognivo: Russian Metal Hits”. The band recorded a demo for the song \\"Wolves of Odin\\" with Kriss Blackburn, singer of Swedish group \\"VII Gates\\". Over the next year the band was busy recording the album \\"Labirint Illyuziy” (“Labyrinth of Illusion\\"), which came out in 2007 in the traditional \\"MetalisM Records\\", this time – together with the \\"Sound Age Rec.\\". On 7 January 2009 the next album \\"Jelezniy Rassudok\\" (\\"Iron Mind\\") came out in the beginning in the form of free Internet release, and a little later – on 20 April 2009 – in CD format on the label \\"Metalism Records\\". Soon bass guitarist Andrey Evseenko left the band and by the end of the year vocalist Holger Komarov also left the band. Holger s currently busy with his one-man- project \\"Oko / Rokolo\\". After the next album \\"Iron Mind\\" when Holger Komaroff made a decision to step down as the band's vocalist and with his departure the Russian-lyrics period is ended, and the band returned to the English lyrics. =Virtual band (2009–2012) and \\"Project Holy Dragons\\" (2009–2011)= After Holger’s departure the band converted into a studio project. The group returned to the English-lyrics format. A person, hiding under a pseudonym The Zerstörer, performed the functions of a singer and bass-guitarist, who made his recording debut with the band on the album, Runaway 12. The second half of 2009 and the beginning of 2010 marked active studio work, which resulted in two releases in 2010. He also recorded vocals for \\"Zerstorer – The Chapters of World War III\\" – a concept album dedicated to the mysteries of the Cold War and the nuclear confrontation of the superpowers. The album was out as a free Internet release as a result of this virtual membership. This was to be his final release with Holy Dragons, and by the end of 2010 Tne Zerstörer was replaced by Ian Breeg, an associate of Rhapsody of Fire and Blind Guardian members, Oliver and Alex Holzwarth (Holzwarth Brothers), who was also a member of Brutal Godz and Hammerforce bands. The band removed the word \\"project\\" from its name and went back to its original name. Version with Ian Breeg vocals is released in autumn of 2012 in CD format by the European label Pitch Black Records. The album is sold through a distribution network of Nuclear BlastZerstörer on the Item number: 208450 and other labels. In the same year, after finishing instrumental recording of the next forthcoming album Dragon Inferno, Jürgen created a solo electronic instrumental space rock-ambient project \\"The Heepnotizer\\", also available for free download.\\"The Heepnotizer\\" project on But, Breeg recorded only one full-length album with the band, which was titled Zerstorer (and two singles: \\"Majestic 12\\" and \\"Three Ways of Genocide\\"), after that being replaced by Alexandr Kuligin, who made his recording debut with the band on \\"Dragon Inferno\\" (2014). In the first half of 2012, bassist Ivan Manchenko joined the band. The band started active rehearsals of the new concert programme and finalized the work on the recordings of vocals for Dragon Inferno. The problems arise for the already recorded album, scheduled for the autumn of 2013. This schedule is ruined because of disagreements with Ian Breeg. Ian Breeg leaves the group, the group has to overwrite the vocal tracks of the album Dragon Inferno with guest vocalists. Soon the place near the microphone was taken by Alexandr Kuligin on the regular basis, however, all in the same \\"virtual\\" format. The album was released on the same label, Pitch Black Records, with the support of other labels.Dragon Inferno on Item number: 235686 =H-Dragons (2013 -)= In 2013, the band created a side-project- H-DRAGONS, guitarist Jürgen Thunderson composed songs and became a lead singer for this project. H-DRAGONS initially focused on Russian-speaking audience, online distribution and the free distribution of their records. On 6 August 2013 H-DRAGONS presented their debut single \\"Subjective Reality\\" in the form of a free-distributed online release formats FLAC, MP3. In 2014 the band released four singles – \\"Sinister Piper\\", \\"Characters Cursed Sleep\\", \\"Toothless Wolf\\" and \\"Emptiness\\". =With Alexandr Kuligin (2014–2016)= In October 2014, Cyprus label Pitch Black Records releases a new album called \\"Dragon Inferno\\". In this album, the band made a bet on experimentation with vocals – in addition to the main singer Alexandr Kuligin, this album also featured two session vocalists, Sergey Zubkov and Artemiy Ryabovol. The album has 11 tracks, four of which were published on singles \\"Majestic 12\\" and \\"Three Ways of Genocide\\" in 2012 with vocals of Ian Breeg. Holy Dragon's 2014 release has been awarded \\"Kazakhstan release of the year\\" by Global Metal Apocalypse blog and was included to Global Metal Apocalypse compilation GMA HQ 2014 with \\"Black Moon Rising\\" track. In 2015 (as a free-distribution online format) there was published a five-song EP \\"Dragon Inferno Outtakes\\", which included the rejected versions of the songs of the album \\"Dragon Inferno\\". In the end of 2015 the band takes part in the RUSSIAN-LANGUAGE TRIBUTE TO HELLOWEEN project by internet portal MASTERSLAND.COM and a sci-fi writer Valentin Lezhenda (co-author of the popular book series S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Metro 2033 and Inhabited Island, presenting a cover version of Helloween 's song Ride the Sky (Russian language version – \\"V Nebesa\\"). On the 31 st of October the track is released as a free Internet single, including both – the Russian and the English language versions. The beginning of 2016 saw Holy Dragons opening a RUSSIAN-LANGUAGE TRIBUTE TO RAGE with RAGE cover \\"Sent by the Devil\\", which is MASTERSLAND.COM project together with the writer Valentin Lezhenda. On 15 April 2016, the band released a new album under the name \\"Civilizator\\" via Pitch Black Records. The album was released as a CD and digitally. =Thora Thorheim as a live vocalist= Guitarist of the band Thora Thornheim aka Chris Caine has debuted as a live concerts vocalist in April 2015. Alexandr Kuligin, who has never performed as the frontman of the band live, had softly departed after the release of \\"Civilizator\\".

Listed at 5' 5\\", 135 lb., she batted and threw right handed.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary – W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Softcover, 295 pp. Language: English. . Like many players, Pat Brown had a brief career in the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League because she felt that the schedule demanding and the continuing trips interfered with her studies. She then went on to obtain four degrees and be listed in four different Who's Who directories for her accomplishments during a law librarian career that spanned forty years of dedicated service to Suffolk University in Boston. Born in Winthrop, Massachusetts, Patricia was the youngest of four children in the family of Joseph and Harriet (née Taylor) Brown. While growing up, she had two dreams: to play baseball and to attend college. She was told she could not play baseball because she was a girl and could not attend college because she had no money. Nevertheless, she achieved both of these dreams. Brown started playing sandlot ball at an early age with her brothers Joseph Jr., Thomas and Alan and their neighborhood friends. Playing sandlot baseball was a real struggle for me at first. I was so tired of hearing that I should go home and play with my dolls that I wanted to cry, she remembered. But the young Pat did not scream at the boys. She just bided her time. From time in time I played first base, second base, and shortstop, as well all three outfield positions. I never dared to volunteer to be the catcher, and luckily no one ever asked me to catch, she added.A League Of My Own: Memoir of a Pitcher for the All- American Girls From 1946 through 1948 Brown attended Winthrop High School, where she excelled in basketball, field hockey and tennis. Under the direction of Ellen Kiernan, she was a member of the field hockey team that played outside schools for the first time since before World War II. Nevertheless, Brown did not play organized softball until being in high school. Even Little League Baseball had started in 1939 in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Winthrop did not as yet a Little League team. Not that mattered to her, because girls were not allowed to play baseball. It not was until 1974 that Little League announced, almost relunctantly, that its teams were open to girls. Following her graduation, Brown became interested in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League after reading about it in a Boston newspaper. She sent a letter to the league's headquarters in Chicago. Pretty soon she received got a letter asking her to come to a tryout involving hundreds of girls. She was not considered, but in 1950 a second chance came. This time she made a good impression on the league's scouts with her strong throwing arm. Finding women who could pitch was a problem for the league, she explained.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Brown was signed as a pitcher and was assigned to the Kenosha Comets. But Comets manager Johnny Gottselig felt she had control issues and need refinement, so she was sent to the Chicago Colleens development touring team. Brown was promoted to the Battle Creek Belles in 1951, but she did not have much of a chance to show her abilities.1950 Chicago Colleens. Retrieved 2019-03-27.1951 Battle Creek Belles. Retrieved 2019-03-27. She collected a 9-9 pitching record for the Colleens, while posting a .298 batting average and a .394 on-base percentage in 23 games. Her stint with the Belles was limited to two innings of shutout ball in one pitching appearance.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book – W. C. Madden.

Brown attended Suffolk University during the off-season, but when the college would not release her early in order to play and the league would not allow her report her late in the season, she opted to quit baseball and decided to concentrate on her studies. She then earned Bachelor of Arts (1955), Juris Doctor (1965) and Master of Business Administration (1970) degrees from Suffolk University, and a MTS degree from Gordon–Conwell Theological Seminary (1977). Brown was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar Association in 1965. She received her Librarian's Certification in 1963 and her Law Librarian's Certification in 1967. She then had a 40-year career as the Law Librarian and Professor at Suffolk University. In addition, she was a longtime member of the Winthrop Council on Aging; the SHINE Program (Serving Health Information Needs of Elders) counseling at the Winthrop Senior Center, retiring as a Law Librarian Emeritus in 1992. In 1988 Brown received further recognition when she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Then, in September 1990, she was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch at a Boston Red Sox home game against the Milwaukee Brewers at Fenway Park. She was joined in the ceremony by Patricia Courtney, Maddy English and Mary Pratt, other Massachusetts residents who played significant roles in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.Retrosheet.com – Boston Red Sox 5, Milwaukee Brewers 4. Game Played on Monday, September 10, 1990 at Fenway Park Besides this, Brown received numerous awards and recognitions over the years. She appears listed in the Who's Who in America, Who's Who in American Law, Who's Who in the East, and Who's Who of American Women directories. In February 1990, the Women's Sports Foundation presented her an award For Outstanding Service in Women's Sports, during the governor's annual Massachusetts Women in Sports Day at the State House in Boston. She also was honored at the dedication of the Suffolk University girls' basketball team first home game in their new gym in February 1991, and was inducted in the First Annual Winthrop High School Hall of Fame in March 1997. By 1993, she spent over a year working with the New England Sports Museum to organize an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League display. She formed a working group that included former AAGPBL players Wilma Briggs and Marie Mansfield, as well as the aforementioned Maddy English, Mary Pratt and herself, of course. The finished exhibition contains assorted pictures, an original contract, and baseball spikes, gloves and uniforms, among other memorabilia. She wrote A League Of My Own: Memoir of a Pitcher for the All-American Girls, which was published by McFarland & Company, in 2003. In her book, she shares her thoughts on the league's history, including what Philip K. Wrigley sought to do by creating the AAGPBL in 1943, what happened after that, and why the league folded after its twelve years of existence. I feel like I have finally pitched my no-hit game, she commented about her book. Patricia Brown died in Park Ridge, Illinois, at the age of 81.

A Holy Trinity Church was built during interwar Yugoslavia in the center of Banja Luka. The construction of the temple lasted from 1925 to 1929, and was solemnly consecrated on the Day of Salvation in 1939. During the German bombing on April 12, 1941, the temple was hit and the altar section (apse) was significantly damaged. In May of the same year, the Ustashas declared the temple a \\"mound of the city\\" and ordered the Serbs, Jews and Roma to completely demolish it, brick by brick. During socialist Yugoslavia, while many buildings were rebuilt, the demolished Cathedral was not allowed to be reconstructed. During the Bosnian war, Eparchy of Banja Luka was granted permission for the destroyed temple to be rebuilt, and the monument to fallen soldiers was moved to a nearby site, also owned by the church. The erection of the new temple began in 1993 when the foundations were sanctified. This solemn act was performed by Serbian Patriarch Pavle with the bishops and clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The temple was rebuilt under the name of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, because, in the meantime, a temple was named after the Holy Trinity in Banja Luka (1963-1969), as a memorial to the demolished one, which the Orthodox Serbs thought would never be able construct again. The cathedral is built of red and yellow travertine stone, originating from Mesopotamia, whose quality (excavation and processing) is guaranteed by prof. Dr. Bilbija, an expert from the Belgrade Institute for Material Testing. It is built with a three-layer wall: stone, reinforced concrete, brick. The domes are covered with golden stainless steel, brought from Siberia. Exterior construction work on the temple was completed on September 26, 2004, when the first liturgy was also served. The liturgy was served by 8 bishops with the clergy and deacons of the Diocese of Banja Luka, with the presence of tens of thousands of believers. The present temple is architecturally identical to the previous one and is the tallest religious building in Banja Luka, with a bell tower 47 meters high and a 22.5 meter dome.

History  The agglomeration Augsburg (Regio A³) and the metropolitan area of Munich are two of the largest business locations in Bavaria with a large number of international companies having their seats there. For local companies an international school is an important site factor in the competition for foreign specialists and executives.International School Augsburg (German) - website provided by Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung, last downloaded on April 24, 2012. Therefore, the ISA was established with the support of the IHK Schwaben (International Chamber of Commerce in Swabia) and opened in 2005 for its first school year. The location of choice was Gersthofen, situated 15 minutes from downtown Augsburg, 30 minutes from Munich and having good access to transport. In 2005, 65 children started their first school year in preschool (Early Learning Centre), Lower School (grade 1 to 5) and the first year of Middle School (grade 6). In 2010, the first class took their International General Certificate of Secondary Education exams (IGCSE) and in the following school year 2010/11 the High School was set up. In school year 2017/18, 342 students from more than 26 nations were enrolled in the ISA. In 2018, the seventh class took their International Baccalaureate exams (IB Diploma).  Campus: the buildings  In 2005, the school moved into the first bricks-and mortar-built building in Ziegeleistraße.

The band was formed in 2010 by Jana Hunter, Geoff Graham, Abram Sanders and Will Adams. Lower Dens has released four albums: their debut on Gnomonsong and a follow up album on Ribbon Music. Their third album, Escape from Evil, was released on March 31, 2015 on Ribbon Music.  History  = Formation and Twin-Hand Movement = The idea for the band formed when Jana Hunter, at that time performing as a solo artist under his own name, grew tired of touring and decided to take a hiatus from the road. For his final tour before this planned hiatus, he put together a backing band. The enjoyment Hunter got from playing with a band versus performing as a solo artist gave him the idea to form Lower Dens: \\"During that tour, I realised that it wasn’t the touring life that I hated, but more so that the kind of music I wrote as a solo artist wasn’t something I felt entirely comfortable sharing in a performance setting. Lower Dens then was eventual result of the decision to make music with the specific intention of sharing and enjoying it with others.\\" According to bassist Geoff Graham, the band's creative process starts with Hunter creating \\"song sketches\\" which the band finishes together: \\"Every song is different but we do try to make decisions democratically, and try every idea and then decide by majority what choices we make.\\" After playing several shows in early 2010, the band released their first album Twin Hand Movement on July 20, 2010 via Gnomonsong. Pitchfork gave the album a rating of 8.1, comparing Hunter's vocals to those of PJ Harvey and Beach House's Victoria Legrand. Dusted Magazine praised the album's lyrics, stating that they are \\"delivered without irony, yet self-aware enough to appreciate the obviousness.\\" = Nootropics and other projects = The band began writing their sophomore album while still on tour supporting Twin-Hand Movement. The limitations of writing on the road forced Hunter to work through a laptop and a keyboard rather than the guitar, which led to the increased presence of synths on the album: \\"I did try to write with a guitar on headphones through a tiny amp plugged into ... the cigarette lighter of the car, but that is an extraordinarily inefficient way to write music ... I talked the band into getting laptop; we got Garage Band and a MIDI digital interface keyboard, and that’s how most of the record was written.\\" After finishing up touring for Twin-Hand Movement, the band chose to record their followup at The Key Club in Benton Harbor, MI. Hunter cited the studio's location as an imperative part of the recording process: \\"It's just very simple, and there are farm stands and a beautiful, great lake nearby. Fewer distractions meant more focus ... We slept nights in bunk beds above the studio. It was, in many ways, perfect.\\" Graham noted the amount of time spent in the studio as another important factor: \\"We had a month of working 7 days a week, living in the studio we were recording in ... we had time to add all these extra dimensions and it made things lusher and thicker.\\" In an interview with Stereogum, Hunter listed Kraftwerk's Radio- Activity, Fripp & Eno, and David Bowie's production on Iggy Pop's The Idiot as major influences during the writing and recording periods. Nootropics was released on April 30, 2012 via Domino Recording Company's Ribbon Music. The album received positive reviews from major publications including Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and Spin. Joe Colly of Pitchfork praised the album's first single \\"Brains\\" for adding \\"krautrock and electronic touches to the group's signature guitar swirl\\" and suggesting \\"a new dimension and a new confidence\\" for the band. In April 2013, the band opened for Beach House and Yo La Tengo at the Baltimore stop of the latter's Fade tour.

Koniecpolski dealt a crushing defeat to Khan Temir's forces near Novyi Martyniv (Мартинів). The victory at Martyniów was the biggest Polish victory over the Tatar raiders in a century. Background In the spring of 1624 the Crimean Tatars began to organize another raid into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth borderlands. The horde, led by Khan Temir, approached the Commonwealth in May, and hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski gathered forces to stop it. However, his army was numerically inferior, so that at first he could only carry out delaying actions. By 13 January when he received intelligence that the horde had begun to turn back, he had about 5,000 troops: 600 hussars, 1350 registered Cossacks cavalry, 650 additional Cossack cavalry, 1450 other light cavalry, 350 infantry, 450 nobles from pospolite ruszenie, and several light cannons. This force included several notable soldiers and commanders, such as Stefan Chmielecki, Jan Odrzywolski, Samuel Łaszcz, Paweł Czarniecki and Stefan Czarniecki. He sent some forces, including mobilized peasants, to block possible routes of retreat for the horde, in order to force the horde to cross a river near the village of Martynów, where he planned to ambush them. The Tatar strength is unknown. Leszek Podhorodecki cites a contemporary diarist's estimate of 15,000, calling it a \\"gross exaggeration\\". Battle Freeing of the jasyr prisoners Koniecpolski had to lay several possible ambushes, as Khan Temir was a savvy tactician, and would not fall easily into a trap. Eventually, he tricked the Tatars into attacking his lines, and after some feints by both sides, he managed to trick them into attacking a fortified tabor formation. In order to entrap Khan Temir, Koniecpolski created the illusion that his forces were retreating, abandoning high ground and leaving some scattered wagons with supplies, suggesting disorder. The Tatar attack was absorbed by the Polish cavalry, and a bloody battle ensued, which after about an hour caused the Tatars to break off. Koniecpolski's then pursued them, before withdrawing again, this time luring Tatars into the artillery fire of the tabor formation. This was followed by the charge of all 12 chorągiews of Polish cavalry. In the ensuing retreat, many Tatars drowned in the Dniestr river or nearby muds, and Khan Temir was wounded. Polish forces pursued the fleeing Tatars, and were able to free most of the people the Tatars had captured and were leading into slavery (jasyr). The Polish pursuit ended on the night of 20 to 21 June. Aftermath The victory at Martyniów was a major success for Koniecpolski, as it was the biggest Polish victory over the Tatar raiders in a century. At the same time, Khan Temir lost some influence among the Tatars. References ;Bibliography * *Winged Hussars, Radoslaw Sikora, Bartosz Musialowicz, BUM Magazine, 2016.

Completed in 1893, it replaces the now ruined St Anne's Chapel (Sct Anna Kapel). History In the Middle Ages, Gudhjem's St Anne's Chapel served the fishing communities on Bornholm's northern coast and was probably also used by Hanseatic visitors from the north of Germany. Based in particular on the fresco's discovered on the south wall, it is estimated that the chapel was built around 1300. Alterations were first carried out in the Middle Ages and again in 1790. With the Reformation the church passed from the Archbishopric of Lund to the Danish crown where it still belonged in 1809 but later became fully independent as is the present church. In 1895, the old church was dismantled. The new church, consecrated on 3 September 1893, was located to the west of the old churchyard as it was decided to leave the foundations of St Anne's in place, safeguarding its site as one of the island's last coastal chapels.Otto Norn, C. G. Schultz, Erik Skov, \\"Allinge Kirke: Bornholms Nørre Herred\\", Danmarks Kirker, Bornholm, Nationalmuseet, Gad, 1954, pp. 432–448. Description Designed by Mathias Bidstrup, the new church consists of a nave, a polygonal apse at the eastern end and a tower with a spire to the west. It is built of granite blocks and has a slate roof. Some of the artefacts from the old church can be seen in the new one. The altarpiece in the form of a triptych dates from c. 1475 and is from a Lübeck workshop. The centrepiece shows the Virgin Mary on her deathbed together with the twelve apostles. The panel on the left depicts St Anne with the infant Jesus as well as St John and other saints. The right panel presents St Dorothea with St Olaf to one side. The pulpit from 1575 was substantially reworked in 1789. Its four panels, separated by columns, show the four apostles.\\"Gudhjem kirke\\", Bornholmerguiden.dk. Retrieved 16 July 2012.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a southeast European country, while Turkey is a transcontinental country with a small European part on the Balkan peninsula around Istanbul. Diplomatic relations between the two countries started on 29 August 1992. Bosnia and Herzegovina has two embassies in Ankara and Izmir and one consulate in Istanbul, while Turkey has one embassy in Sarajevo and one consulate in Mostar. The two countries enjoy very warm diplomatic relations, due to historical and cultural ties dating back to the 15th century. There is a large population of Bosniaks in Turkey and a smaller community of Turks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. History Due to strong bonds between the Bosnian region and the Ottoman Empire since the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans historically, a significant Turkish community as well as ties linking Bosnia and Turkey were established when Bosnia fell under Ottoman rule. Bosnia and Herzegovina was an important region for the Ottomans. Being its westernmost province, the Ottomans invested heavily in military infrastructure at the borderlands, and at the same time promoted cordial relations between settler Turks and the local populace. Many historical Ottoman figures, such as the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, came from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most Turks left Bosnia and Herzegovina after Austria-Hungary occupied this region in 1878, although it de jure remained Ottoman territory for another 30 years. It was officially annexed in 1908, bringing the 445-year Ottoman era to an end. After Mustafa Kemal Atatürk established the newly Republic of Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire, many modern Turkish politicians sought to Bosnia and Herzegovina with Turkey, according to the motto of \\"two states, one heart.\\" Under Yugoslav rule, religious observance declined, in spite of the fact that Josip Broz Tito did not totally suppress other religions like most other Communist nations during the Cold War. =Bosnian War= Turkey recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state on 6 February 1992. It was one of the first countries to do so; Bosnia and Herzegovina did not formally declare independence until the following month. Both countries established diplomatic relations on 29 August 1992. On 22 July 1995, Turkish president Süleyman Demirel mediated between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia when both countries signed the Split Agreement which enabled joined defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia against Serb forces. Post-war relations Mustafa Cerić, the president of the Islamic community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, stated: \\"Turkey is our mother, so it was, so it will remain.\\" On 11 July 2012, while visiting commemoration of Srebrenica massacre in Srebrenica, Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, stated that Alija Izetbegović told him while he visited him in hospital that he left him \\"Bosnia [and Herzegovina] as a testament\\" and that \\"Bosnia [and Herzegovina] is an inheritance of the Ottomans\\". In recent years Turkish influence amongst the Bosniak politicians is growing. Erdogan is known for his effort in conciliation of two major Bosniak political parties, the Party of Democratic Action and the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the latter is de iure a multi-ethnic party. Many Bosnian towns with a Bosniak majority have streets named after Ottoman statesmen and conquerors. In center of Sarajevo there is a street named after Sokollu Mehmed Pasha and in Bihać there is a street named after Suleiman the Magnificent. In March 2018, Bosnian leader Bakir Izetbegovic said, some days before the visit of the Turkish President in Bosnia, that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is a mentor for the Muslims and this is the reason that West doesn't like him.Bosnian leader: Erdoğan long-awaited mentor for Muslims In 2016, as part of a state project named \\"living languages and accents in Turkey\\" the Turkish government accepted the Bosnian language as a selective course for its schools and announced that classes would start in 2018, first being piloted in areas with people of Balkan origins such as the Izmir region. =Turkish lobbyist group UEBD= In February 2018, a new pro-Turkish lobby group with the acronym \\"UEBD\\" was founded. Its opening promotional video, titled Olive Branch from Bosnia, a reference to the ongoing Turkish offensive against Syrian Kurds, showed Bosnians from all walks of life voicing their admiration and support for Turkey's military operation, spoken in fluent Turkish, and supplemented with prayers for the success of Turkey's operation. The new lobby group has raised suspicions in Bosnia and in Western countries about Erdogan's intentions to \\"strengthen his influence\\" in the Balkans.

As such, Alarid was the last Mexican governor of New Mexico. Early career Juan Bautista Vigil y Alarid was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1792, son of Domingo Vigil and María Francisca Alarid, both from military families. In 1808 he married Rafaela Sánchez in Tomé, New Mexico. After the independence of Mexico from Spain in 1821, he became secretary of state to the first Mexican governor of New Mexico, Francisco Javier Chávez. He was to serve in various positions in the New Mexican government until the United States take-over. New Mexico was at first a province of the Estado interno del Norte, with capital in Chihuahua. In May 1824 Vigil was New Mexican deputy to the state congress in Chihuahua. As of 6 July 1824, New Mexico was made a separate territory, with El Paso del Norte (now called Ciudad Juárez) transferred from New Mexico to the State of Chihuahua, a move that Vigil opposed. In 1826 Vigil was appointed customs collector by the central government, in charge of regulating the trade with the United States via the Santa Fe Trail, a difficult position and one in which he came to blows with the trader Charles Bent. Acting governor Vigil y Alarid was left in charge as acting Governor of New Mexico when his predecessor Manuel Armijo fled Santa Fe to escape the approaching U.S. troops under General Stephen W. Kearny. On 19 August 1846 he accepted the defeat of New Mexico and pledged the loyalty of himself and his fellow citizens to the United States. In his speech he said, presumably reflecting the views of other leading citizens: In September 1846 Kearny appointed Charles Bent as Vigil y Alarid's successor. Later career Vigil y Alarid moved south to Aldama, just north of Chihuahua city, some time before 1851. He was elected to the local council of Guadelupe on 10 February 1852. The head of the council was Father Ramón Ortiz, who was also the commissioner of repatriation for emigrants from New Mexico. He participated with Ortiz in organizing the festivities for Mexican Independence Day on 16 September 1852. However, Vigil testified against Ortiz during an investigation of his activities as emigrant commissioner the next year, that led to dismissal of Ortiz. After 1846, Alarid y Vigil fought for the rights of Mexicans by using the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo to their advantage, until he considered that, in fact, his Mexican homeland \\"had died.\\" After losing a political office in New Mexico, he ended up allying with Mexico again and defended the old loyalties. Little is known about Vigil's later life until his death in 1866.

It designs, builds and operates the UK payments infrastructure, which underpins the provision of the Bacs payment system and the UK ATM LINK switching platform covering 65,000 ATMs and the UK Faster Payments systems. Vocalink processes over 90% of UK salaries, more than 70% of household bills and 98% of state benefits. In 2013 the company processed over 10.5 billion UK payments with a value of over £5 trillion. In July 2016 MasterCard purchased a 92% stake in the company, with the remainder to be held by UK banks for a period of three years. Background In 1968, the Joint Stock Banks Clearing Committee chaired by Dennis Gladwell, set-up the Inter-Bank Computer Bureau to modernise the existing paper-based standing order system. Secure electronic funds transfer between banks was introduced from later that year, significantly reducing both the processing time and human error associated with paper-based transactions, particularly bulk payments. In 1971 the company adopted the name \\"Bankers Automated Clearing Services Limited\\", soon shortened to Bacs, which was formally adopted as the company's name in 1985. =Cruickshank Report= In November 1998 HM Treasury commissioned a review of competition within the UK banking sector, to be chaired by Sir Don Cruickshank. Reporting in March 2000, The Cruickshank Report of competition within the UK banking sector recommended that: *Clearance scheme ownership and management should be split from infrastructure operation and delivery *Infrastructure management should be conducted on a commercial basis with fair and open access to third parties *A need for a low-cost way to transfer money quickly In response, on 1 December 2003, Bacs Payment Schemes Ltd (BPSL) was split from Bacs Limited. BPSL was established as a not for profit company with members from the banking industry, the purpose of which is to promote the use of automated payment schemes and govern the rules of the Bacs scheme. Bacs Limited owns the infrastructure to run the Bacs scheme. Bacs Limited was permitted to continue to use the Bacs name for one year, becoming Voca Limited on 12 October 2004. =LINK Interchange Network Ltd= LINK Interchange Network Ltd was formed in 1985 to create interoperability between ATMs across the United Kingdom. It became an international network in the 1990s through connection with the MasterCard and Visa networks. In October 2002 LINK launched the first service that used ATMs as a retail channel, enabling the facility to top-up a mobile phone at an ATM, bringing banking and mobile phones together for the consumer. Faster Payments Service In 2005 a joint proposal from Voca and LINK was selected to deliver the payment-processing infrastructure for the Faster Payments Service, a near real-time interbank transfer for internet and telephone banking. After forming a strong working partnership, which brought Voca's bulk processing together with LINK's real-time payment switching, the companies agreed to merge on 2 July 2007 to form VocaLink. Since its launch in 2008, over 3 billion real-time faster payment transactions have been processed by VocaLink. UK payments infrastructure VocaLink operates its services out of two data centres based in the UK; based in Harrogate and Dunstable. =Bacs= Bacs provides two payment products to consumers: * Bacs Direct Credits, payer-initiated interbank transfers. VocaLink processes 2 billion of these payments every year, including over 90% of all UK salaries and 98% of state benefits. * Direct Debits, transfers initiated by authorised payees. Three-quarters of UK adults have at least one direct debit commitment; the average person has at least six. VocaLink provides the underlying BacsTEL-IP infrastructure for Bacs, which processes over 5.6 billion of clearing and settlement of automated payments a year, with a value of £4.2 trillion. =LINK= VocaLink provides the switching infrastructure behind LINK, the busiest ATM switching system in the world which switches over 3.5 billion card-initiated transactions from 130 million enabled cards annually. =Faster Payments Service= VocaLink designed, built and operates the infrastructure for the Faster Payments Service on behalf of the Faster Payments Scheme. Running in parallel with Bacs and CHAPS, launched in 2008 it enables interbank transfers in real time. Since 2008, over three billion Faster Payments transactions have been securely processed by VocaLink. Mobile payments =Paym= VocaLink provides the underlying technology to Paym, a mobile payment system for the UK developed by the Payments Council. Recipients are identified by their mobile phone number instead of bank details such as sort code and account number. It was launched through participating banks and building societies in April 2014, and once users opt-in will by the end of 2014 support 9 out of 10 UK bank accounts. =Zapp= VocaLink has developed Zapp, a function that will reside within mobile banking apps to allow users to make real-time payments to retailers when shopping online or in-store. The service will be open to all financial institutions, merchants, acquirers and consumers, when it launches in 2015. A Zapp payment works through secure digital 'tokens', which means that customers don't reveal any of their financial details to retailers. This also means that merchants do not need to store card details. Zapp has been developed by VocaLink who operate the UK payments infrastructure. VocaLink processes over 90% of UK salaries, more than 70% of household bills and 98% of state benefits. In 2013 VocaLink processed over 10 billion transactions with a value of over £5 trillion. Zapp is backed by four UK high street banks, meaning 18m consumer accounts are potentially Zapp-enabled: HSBC, Nationwide, Metro Bank, Santander.  International payments infrastructure  On 12 July 2010 through EAPS, LINK opened all UK cash machines to the similar German Girocard scheme operated by Zentraler Kreditausschuss. Similarly the VocaLink agreement with the Pulse network allows Discover card and Diners Club International cardholders to use LINK ATMs. VocaLink also provides a gateway service to Visa, MasterCard and China Union Pay. Between 2007 and 2012, VocaLink operated a Single Euro Payments Area clearing and settlement mechanism, participating as a member of the European Automated Clearing House Association. The service was discontinued as a consequence of the low participation of VocaLink's shareholder UK banks into the platform. In May 2008, VocaLink signed a deal with the Swedish Automated Clearing House Bankgirot, to outsource part of the Swedish payments system. This was the first time that the processing of a national payments scheme has been transferred to a non-domestic player. In March 2014, in partnership with BCS Information Systems, VocaLink launched an immediate payments service, Fast And Secure Transfers (FAST) in Singapore, enabling fourteen Singaporean banks to offer the ability to transfer funds between bank accounts in real time. Take Home Pay Index  The VocaLink Take Home Pay Index tracks monthly take home pay levels in the UK. Compiled using data captured by VocaLink from the salary payments of over two hundred FTSE 350 companies and six hundred public sector organisations, the indices are split by broad sector group: manufacturing; services; public sector; FTSE 350.

Today, the basilica is under the care of the Conventual Franciscans, whose headquarters in Rome is in the adjacent building. The Cardinal Priest of the Titulus XII Apostolorum is Angelo Scola. Among the previous Cardinal Priests are Pope Clement XIV, whose tomb by Canova is in the basilica, and Henry Benedict Stuart.  History  Built by Pope Pelagius I to celebrate the victory of Narses, the general of the Emperor Justinian, over the Ostrogoths, and dedicated by Pope John III to St. James and Saint Philip the Apostle, the basilica is listed as 'Titulus SS Apostolorum' in the acts of the synod of 499. Santi Apostoli was ruined by the earthquake of 1348, and left abandoned. In 1417, Pope Martin V, whose Colonna family owned the adjacent Palazzo Colonna, restored the church, while the facade was built at the end of the same century by Baccio Pontelli. It was frescoed by Melozzo da Forlì whose wall-paintings at Santi Apostoli were renowned for their innovative techniques of foreshortening and came to be regarded as Melozzo's masterpiece. Pope Clement XI instigated dramatic renovations of the church. Melozzo's frescoes were either destroyed or moved partly to the Quirinal and partly to the Vatican Museums. A new Baroque interior was designed by Carlo Fontana and Francesco Fontana, and was completed in 1714. The church was later restored again, with the facade completed by Giuseppe Valadier in 1827. The inscriptions found in SS. XII Apostoli, a valuable source illustrating the history of the church, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.V. Forcella, Inscrizioni delle chese e d' altre edifici di Roma, dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI Volume II (Roma: Fratelli Bencini, 1873), pp. 219-298.  Interior  Facade of the Basilica and plan 250px This church has three naves, divided by a row of Corinthian pillars, supporting the ceiling, on the middle of which is painted in 1707 the Triumph of the Order of St Francis, by Baciccio. There are also frescoes of the Evangelists by Luigi Fontana. The use of perspective is very good, and the angels appear to come out of the vault. Above the sanctuary is a fresco from 1709 by Giovanni Odazzi, representing the \\"Fall of Lucifer and his Angels\\". To the right of the high altar are the tombs of Count Giraud de Caprières (died 1505) and Cardinal Raffaele Riario (died 1474), tentatively attributed to Michelangelo. To the left is a monument to Cardinal Riario, by the school of Andrea Bregno and possible designed by Andrea Bregno himself. There is also a Madonna by Mino da Fiesole. On the wall, to the right of the portico of the ancient church, is an antique bas-relief of an eagle surrounded by an oak crown that it holds in its talons. Opposite is the monument of the engraver Giovanni Volpato executed and erected by his friend and countryman Antonio Canova. It consists of a large bas-relief, representing \\"Friendship\\" in the form of a woman weeping before the bust of the deceased Volpato. On a pier of the nave on the right-hand side, near the first chapel, is enshrined the heart of Maria Klementyna Sobieska, wife of the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart. Her tomb is in St Peter's Basilica. Her monument is by Filippo della Valle. Her husband used to pray here every morning. James III was laid in state here himself in 1766, before he was buried with his wife at St Peter's. = Frescoes of Melozzo da Forlì = 250px 250px Melozzo da Forlì painted, on the ceiling of the great chapel, the Ascension of our Lord. According to Giorgio Vasari, \\"the figure of Christ is so admirably foreshortened as to appear to pierce the vault; and in the same manner the angels are seen sweeping through the field of air in two opposite directions.\\" This painting was executed for Cardinal Raffaele Riario, nephew of Pope Sixtus IV about the year 1472. During the dramatic renovation of the church, it was removed and placed in the Quirinal Palace in 1711, where it is still seen, bearing this inscription: \\"\\". Several heads of the apostles which surrounded it, and were likewise cut away, were deposited in the Vatican palace. = Chapels = The twelve chapels in total, with three domed ones on each side, are adorned with marbles and fine paintings; the painting in the first chapel to the right is by Nicola Lapiccola; and that in the next by Corrado Giaquinto. The Chapel of St. Anthony contains eight fine marble columns, and a painting by Benedetto Luti. The first chapel on the right-hand side is the Chapel of the Immaculate. It has a 15th-century Madonna donated by Cardinal Bessarion (1403–1472). The Chapel of the Crucifixion on the right-hand side is divided into a nave and two aisles. The 8 columns are from the 6th-century church. The tomb of Raffaele della Rovere (died 1477), brother of Pope Sixtus IV and father of Pope Julius II, is found in the chapel on the left side of the crypt. It was designed by Andrea Bregno. The confessio was constructed in 1837. During its construction, the relics of St James and St Philip, which were taken from the catacombs in the 9th century to protect them from invaders, were rediscovered. The wall paintings are reproductions of ancient catacomb paintings. An inscription explains that Pope Stephen IV walked barefoot in 886 from the catacombs to the church carrying the relics on his shoulders. The other chapels were decorated between 1876-1877. Pope Clement XIV (1769–1774) is buried in the last chapel on the left side, near the door of the sacristy. His Neo-Classical tomb is by Antonio Canova, made in 1783-1787. Besides the statue of that Pope, there are two uncommonly fine figures of \\"Temperance\\" and \\"Clemency\\". This was the first major work Canova did in Rome. Beyond the sacristy is the chapel of St. Francis, painted by Giuseppe Chiari. On the altar of the following chapel, the second chapel on the left has an altarpiece from 1777 by Giuseppe Cades, depicting Saint Joseph of Cupertino. The two columns of verde antico, green marble, are the largest known in that type of stone. The \\"Descent of the Cross\\", on the altar of the last chapel, is a famous work of Francesco Manno. On the second pillar on the left side is the epitaph of Cardinal Bessarion, and a 16th-century portrait of him. His mortal remains were moved here in 1957.

The office then formed the basis for the Buyid control over the Abbasid caliphs and over Iraq after 946. The title continued in use by Muslim states in the Middle East, but was mostly restricted to senior military leaders. It was also used in Norman Sicily for a few of the king's chief ministers.  In the Abbasid Caliphate  = Background = The first person to be titled amir al- umara was the commander Harun ibn Gharib, a cousin of the Caliph al-Muqtadir (), in 928.Bosworth & Savory (1989), pp. 969–971 He was followed soon after by his rival, the eunuch Mu'nis al-Muzaffar (845–933), who served as commander- in-chief of the caliphal army and the power behind the throne for most of al- Muqtadir's reign. From 928, Mu'nis was involved in a tumultuous power struggle with his rivals in the court's civilian bureaucracy, which ended with the deposition and execution of al-Muqtadir in 932, and his replacement with his brother al-Qahir (). Mu'nis and the military were now dominant in the affairs of the Abbasid court, beginning a period of troubles that was, in the words of the historian Hugh Kennedy, \\"dominated by the struggles of military men to control the caliphate and, perhaps more importantly, the revenues of the Sawad which would enable them to satisfy the demands of their followers\\".Kennedy (2004), pp. 186–193 Mu'nis himself was executed by al-Qahir in 933, but in 934 another palace coup deposed al-Qahir and replaced him with ar-Radi (). The frequent coups and violent struggle for control of the Caliphate greatly enfeebled the central government in Baghdad. Effective control over the Maghreb and Khurasan had long been lost, but now autonomous rulers emerged in the provinces closer to Iraq: Egypt and Bilad al-Sham were ruled by the Ikhshidid dynasty, the Hamdanid dynasty had secured control over Upper Mesopotamia, and most of Iran was ruled by Daylamite dynasties, among whom the Buyids were most prominent. Even in Iraq itself, the authority of the caliphal government was challenged. Thus in the south, around Basra, Abu Abdallah al- Baridi established his own domain, often refusing to send tax revenues to Baghdad and establishing contacts with the Buyids of nearby Fars.Kennedy (2004), p. 194 The historian Ali ibn al-Athir (d. 1233) asserted that after the death of Mu'nis, the post of amir al-umara fell to Tarif al-Subkari, who was also head of the treasury. = Elevation to regent = Finally, in November 936, the failure of the vizier Ibn Muqla to control the provincial governors and confront the disastrous financial situation of the Caliphate, led to the appointment of the governor of Wasit, Muhammad ibn Ra'iq, to the position of amir al-umara.Kennedy (2004), pp. 194–195 The authority granted to Ibn Ra'iq and his successors was sweeping. According to the contemporary scholar Miskawayh, he was named governor of Baghdad and commander-in-chief of the army, was entrusted with the collection of the kharaj land tax and the supervision of all public estates, as well as the maintenance of security. He was also granted a banner and robes of office, as well as the privileges of being addressed by his kunya, and his name added to the caliph's during the Friday prayer. In effect, writes Miskawayh, the caliph \\"resigned to him the government of the kingdom\\".Donohue (2003), p. 110 Henceforth, effective power in both military and civil administrations passed from the caliph to the amir al-umara and his secretary, who ran the civilian administration. Ibn Ra'iq took care to deprive the caliph of his last support base by disbanding the old household bodyguard, replacing them as the core of the caliphal army with his own Turks and Daylamites. = Struggle for power, 936–946 = Silver dirham of 940/941 CE, with the names of Caliph al-Muttaqi and the amir al-umara Bajkam Despite his extraordinary authority, however, Ibn Ra'iq failed to stabilize the situation and a decade-long complicated power struggle between various regional leaders followed for the office of amir al-umara. On 9 September 938 Ibn Ra'iq was deposed by his former subordinate, the Turk Bajkam, who secured his own succession to the post four days later, and ruled until his death by Kurdish brigands on 21 April 941. Caliph al-Muttaqi (), raised to the throne by Bajkam after al-Radi's death, now tried to restore civilian rule, appointing Ibn Maymun and then Abu Abdallah al-Baridi as viziers, but the military retook control under the leadership of Kurankij, who became amir al- umara on 1 July.Kennedy (2004), pp. 195–196Donohue (2003), p. 9 He was deposed on 16 September by Ibn Ra'iq, who within a few days re-assumed his old position. However, Ibn Ra'iq's restoration provoked the reaction of al-Baridi, whose forces occupied Baghdad, forcing Ibn Ra'iq and al-Muttaqi to flee to the Hamdanid ruler al-Hasan in Mosul. The latter helped the Caliph recover Baghdad, had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated on 13 February 942, and assumed the position of amir al-umara himself on 18 February, with the laqab of Nasir al- Dawla. The Hamdanids too were unable to consolidate their control in the face of financial difficulties, and a military revolt under the Turkish general Tuzun forced Nasir al-Dawla to abandon his post (11 May 943) and retreat to his base at Mosul. Tuzun became the new amir al-umara on 1 June.Kennedy (2004), pp. 196, 270 Al-Muttaqi tried to regain his independence by remaining at Raqqa instead of Baghdad and contacting the Ikhshidids, who encouraged him to seek refuge in Egypt. In the end, al-Muttaqi refused and returned to Baghdad, where Tuzun deposed and blinded him, raising al-Mustakfi () to the throne. Tuzun's tenure lasted until his death in August/September 945, but was overshadowed by the rising power of the Buyids. In 944 Mu'izz al-Dawla tried to take Baghdad but was beaten back. After Tuzun's death, his secretary and successor, Muhammad ibn Shirzad, held only feeble authority and tried to fend off the Buyid threat by allying himself with Nasir al-Dawla. His efforts were in vain, and on 17 January 946, the Buyids under Mu'izz al-Dawla entered Baghdad.Donohue (2003), pp. 9–10Kennedy (2004), pp. 196, 214–215 This began the Buyid era in Baghdad and Iraq, which lasted until the Seljuq conquest in the mid-11th century.cf. Kennedy (2004), pp. 215–240 = Under the Buyids = Possession of the title of amir al-umara formed the institutional framework of Buyid authority in Baghdad itself and vis-a-vis the caliph, who now became simply another state functionary and was given an annual salary. Although Ahmad ibn Buya had seized Baghdad, the strong family ties of the Buyid brothers determined their respective positions with each other, and the post of amir al-umara fell to the elder brother and ruler of Fars, Ali, known by his laqab Imad al-Dawla. After his death in 949 he was succeeded by the eldest surviving brother, Rukn al-Dawla, ruler of Rey, until his death in 976. It appears, however, that Ahmad (Mu'izz al-Dawla), who continued to rule over Iraq, also retained the title for himself, and gave it in addition to his son Izz al-Dawla when he declared him his heir in 955. In response, Rukn al- Dawla's son and heir 'Adud al-Dawla () began to assume titles of sovereignty in Persian fashion, like shahanshah (\\"shah of shahs\\"), malik (\\"king\\"), or malik al-muluk (\\"king of kings\\"), to underline his pre-eminence. Thus, under the later Buyid rulers, Persian titles were more prominent, and amir al-umara came to denote the designated heir-apparent. In general, Buyid use of the title appears to have been inconsistent, and it was employed more as an honorific rather than an office.Donohue (2003), pp. 13–34, 128  In other Muslim states  = Iran and Khurasan = Further east, neither the Samanid Empire nor the Ghaznavids appear to have employed it often, except for the case of Abu Ali Simjuri, a rebel military commander who took control of Khorasan in 991 and proclaimed himself amir al-umara. Later Muslim dynasties, whether Iranian or Turkish, used the title mostly in a military context, although not always associated with the command-in-chief of the army. Thus the Seljuq Turks, who overran the former lands of the Caliphate in the later 11th century, used it as one among many designations for senior military commanders (ispahsalar, amir-i salar, muqaddam al-'askar, etc.). Only two instances are known where the title was held by princes of the dynasty as a mark of distinction: Osman, a son of Chaghri Beg, who in 1073 was named governor of northern Afghanistan, and Muhammad, a grandson of Chaghri Beg, who in 1097 rebelled in Khorasan against his nephew, Sultan Barkiyaruq (). In the Safavid Iran, the title was initially of considerable importance, as it was held by the commander-in-chief of the Qizilbash forces that formed the mainstay of Safavid regime. In the time when Husayn Beg Shamlu occupied the office in 1501–1510, he was the most powerful state official, but after his fall it fell in importance and lost much power, particularly to the qurčibaši, the commanders of the Turkmen tribal cavalry. The amir al-umara enjoyed a revival in the period of Qizilbash tutelage over Tahmasp I in 1524–1533, but thereafter disappears almost completely. It only reappeared occasionally in the late Safavid period, when it designated a military commander exceptionally appointed to a border region threatened with foreign invasion. = Mamluks and Ottomans = The title was also, albeit rarely, used by the Mamluk Sultanate centered in Cairo, apparently associated with the commander of the army (atabak al-'asakir), but also appears to have been given to other amirs. In the Ottoman Empire, it was used, along with the Persian equivalent mir-i miran, as a translation of beylerbey (\\"bey of beys\\").  In Norman Sicily  As a result of the long period of Arab rule in Sicily, the Italo-Norman Kingdom of Sicily continued the use of many Arabic terms in its administration, among which was \\"emir\\" (am[m]iratus in Latin, in Greek, the other two languages in official use), whose holders combined military and civilian authority.

It stars Shyam Fernando and Anjali Patil in lead roles with Maheshwari Ratnam and Wasantha Moragoda. Music composed by Lakshman Joseph De Saram. Based on the 1876 short story \\"A Gentle Creature\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevski, Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka was adapted into a post-war Sri Lankan background. Principal photography was shot in Bogawanthalawa, Central Province, Sri Lanka and Sarasavi Studio in Colombo. Synopsis Sarathsiri, a man in his mid-forties, runs a pawn shop from his two-storied building in a remote town surrounded by tea plantations. He broods, rarely talks, and in his spare time intently watches professional wrestling on TV. One day, Selvi, a young woman, lands at his pawn shop with a fistful of worthless trinkets and keeps coming back. Sarathsiri is intrigued by her and through his maid Lakshmi finds out that Selvi, a Tamil Christian is originally from Kilinochchi, an ethnic civil war stricken area of northern Sri Lanka. Her parents have sent her to this up country area of central Sri Lanka to save her life. Sarathsri gets to know that an older widowed businessman has asked for Selvi's hand in marriage and immediately rushes in to declare his own desire to marry her. She accepts and they get married. Once at home, Sarathsiri teaches her the basics of pawning business and tells her of his dream to own a tea plantation. However, he remains aloof, cold and unresponsive to Selvi who it seems is blossoming after the marriage. One day they go to see a South Indian Tamil movie at a local theatre. Selvi who has never seen a movie on a big screen is visibly happy. Sarathsiri, however, is his dour self and says it was a waste of money. While Selvi exudes a warmth and happiness, Sarathsri remains engrossed in his pawnshop and the wrestling bouts on TV. One day out of the blue, an old friend of Sarathsri appears at his door. Sarathsri drags his friend out for a drink, they return late at night drunk, and have an argument. In the morning while Sarathsiri is asleep Selvi goes downstairs to answer a knock on the door. Gamini (the friend) is awake and asks Selvi to forgive him for barging in unannounced. Selvi discovers through Gamini that Sarathsiri is an ex Sri Lankan army soldier. Shocked, Selvi leaves the house. Sarathsri goes looking for her and finds her at the same bus stop where he had proposed. At night Selvi confronts Sarathsiri and asks him why he hid from her his army past. Dissatisfied with his monosyllabic replies, Selvi says if she knew he had served in the army, she would have never married him. She tells him about her two brothers who were killed by the Sri Lankan army. She informs him that her parents brought her here to save her from being raped by the Sri Lankan army soldiers. Unsettled by her ferocity, Sarathsiri grabs his pillow and blanket and goes downstairs. As he is leaving the upper floor Selvi follows him asking how many Tamil women has he raped and how much gold has he stolen from them. Sarathsiri retorts saying if it wasn't for him, she would be starving. While rummaging through the closet, Selvi discovers a handgun in a hidden drawer. At night while Sarathsiri is asleep, she creeps downstairs and points the gun at his forehead. Next day when she opens the hidden drawer, to her surprise the revolver is missing. She feels that Sarathsiri is watching her. Selvi gradually becomes unresponsive and slips into a depression. With her health failing, Selvi's body is wracked with seizures. Sarathsiri silently watches her withering away. One day he finds Selvi singing to herself. It dawns on Sarathsri that he may lose Selvi. He falls on his knees and confesses to her, pleads with her to speak. He promises to change, be more responsive and begs her to give their relationship one more chance. He offers to go and find her missing parents. On hearing that, Selvi goes into a seizure. Sarathsiri becomes caring and nurturing. He feeds her, looks after her, and talks to her. He confesses that as a soldier he gave false witness to protect his fellow soldiers including Gamini after they were accused of raping and killing a Tamil girl. He tells her that he left the army because he couldn't come to terms with his lie. His confession makes her condition worse as she goes into a deep seizure. In a desperate effort to get her back, Sarathsiri sells his business and offers to take her to India and show her films. One morning Selvi unexpectedly apologises to Sarathsiri about not being the wife he desired and promises to make amends. Overjoyed, Sarathsiri kisses her from head to toe and leaves to buy air tickets for India. Selvi picks up the rosary and prays. Selvi is at peace. She has made her decision.

Poisoning accounts for 1% of NHS admissions. Pesticides used in agriculture (glyphosate and organophosphorus insecticides) are extremely toxic, but 87% of around 120,000 annual poisoning cases in the UK take place in the home. History In August 1962 the Ministry of Health announced it was forming a poisons information service. This was after the Emergency Treatment in Hospital of Cases of Acute Poisoning published by the Central Health Services Council in March 1962. Many more household chemicals were on the market, and the chemical composition was only known to the manufacturers. 4,000 to 5,000 people each year were lethally poisoned, with 6,085 in 1962; however, many of the deaths were (non-accidental) suicides. It started in 1963 by Dr Roy GouldingRoy Goulding at the Medical Toxicology Unit of Guy's Hospital, with a staff of 65. By the late 1960s, recreational drugs were presenting a widespread danger. Other centres were soon set up in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff. UKTIS was based in Newcastle from 1995. Structure It has four units in Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Newcastle. It is a member of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists. * NPIS Birmingham Unit (West Midlands Poisons Unit), City Hospital, Birmingham - Professor Allister Vale * NPIS Cardiff Unit, Llandough Hospital - Dr Laurence Gray * NPIS Edinburgh Unit (Scottish Poisons Information Bureau),Scottish Poisons Information Bureau Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh - Dr. Euan Sandilands. * NPIS Newcastle Unit, Regional Drug and Therapeutics Centre,Regional Drug and Therapeutics Centre Newcastle University - Professor Simon Thomas NPIS Birmingham has the NPIS Product Data Centre, provided by manufacturer's information, and deals with around 2,300 companies. NPIS supports (24 hours) NHS Direct (for England and Wales) and (24 hours) NHS 24 for Scotland. Northern Ireland has its Northern Ireland Regional Medicines and Poisons Information Service in Belfast, and NPIS is used when this is not available. The Republic of Ireland uses the service, via the TOXBASE database, which is used by the country's National Poisons Information Centre.Poisons Information Centre - Ireland Of all UK nations, Wales has the highest proportionate number of enquiries to the service, with Northern Ireland the fewest. Within England, there is a distribution of higher number of enquiries to the service in the north than the south, with NHS North East having the highest and NHS South of England having the least proportionate number of enquiries. The vast majority (95%) of enquiries come from A&E; departments. Around 65% of poisoning is from pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, ibuprofen, citalopram, diazepam and zopiclone) and 15% from household chemicals (detergents, bleach, and isopropanol).Annual report There are very dangerous chemicals stored in most UK kitchens. Wednesday is the busiest day of the week for enquiries, with the fewest at the weekend. Function The NPIS operates a 24-hour telephone advice service and internet database TOXBASE (www.toxbase.org for registered healthcare departments only). TOXBASE is free for UK NHS departments, and available by subscription to departments outwith the UK NHS. The TOXBASE app is also available for Apple and Android devices. The app is free for individual NHS users. The TOXBASE database contains information on approximately 17,000 products, together with generic advice on the management of poisoning. In excess of 1.5 million product accesses are made to the database each year. Most of the accesses are made by A&E; staff. NHS 111, NHS 24 and NHS Direct all use the TOXBASE database.

The 58-minute documentary was written, directed and narrated by Michael Rubbo and produced by Tom Daly for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Production Rubbo had originally gone to Vietnam with the stated goal of making a documentary about the work of Foster Parents Plan with Vietnamese war orphans. However, once there, and confronted with the enormity of what was taking place, he felt a film about this humanitarian operation was missing the real story. Rubbo's NFB producer, Tom Daly, supported him in his efforts to entirely rethink the film. Rubbo met the children in the film through Dick Hughes, a young American who offered his apartment as a safe haven for street kids. Hughes was part of a group of American student journalists who adopted a New Journalism approach covering the war—a highly personal and involved approach that would influence Rubbo's own style in making this film. This group of young journalists included John Steinbeck IV. Rubbo recorded his own subjective observations in a diary and developed the idea for what would be the first of his self- reflexive documentaries with the NFB. In Sad Song of Yellow Skin, Rubbo often comments on his own actions within the film, expressing his doubts, fears and concerns, reminding the viewer they are watching a film and not an objective representation of reality. Awards Awards for Sad Song of Yellow Skin included a special Canadian Film Award and the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary. It was named best film over 30 minutes at the 1971 Melbourne Film Festival.

They contain a section of Chester Rows, with shops at street level and along the Rows, and an arcade of shops stretching behind these to link with the Grosvenor Shopping Centre. The whole structure is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The buildings were first completed in 1910 for the 2nd Duke of Westminster. They were designed by W. T. Lockwood. In the initial design, the Bridge Street façade was faced with cream and gold ceramic tiles (faience), with Baroque decoration. However, there was strong public opposition to the design because it was too much of a contrast from the Black-and-white Revival buildings that had been recently erected in the city. Following a petition from Chester City Council, and the Bishop of Chester, the duke was persuaded to remove the façade, and to replace it with timber framing. The entrance from Bridge Street was modified in 2000 when the steps were replaced. Interior of the arcade Architecture The structure probably has a steel frame. The Bridge Street façade is mainly timber framed, with plaster panels, and some brick and faience decoration. It is roofed in green Westmorland slate. It is in five storeys, with five gables, and is expressed in an E-plan with three projecting bays. There are two shops at street level, two more at row level, and a further 20 in the arcade, most of which have modern fronts. The interior of the arcade is faced with faience.

It first aired on BBC One in the UK on 8 September 2012 and on BBC America on the same date in the United States. It was written by Chris Chibnall and directed by Saul Metzstein. The episode features alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) accompanied by Rory's father, Brian (Mark Williams), Queen Nefertiti (Riann Steele), and John Riddell, a British big-game hunter (Rupert Graves). The group lands on a large spaceship that contains dinosaurs and discover that it is a Silurian ark, though the Silurians have been murdered by Solomon (David Bradley), a black market trader who is intent on finding something of value. \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\" was conceived to be a fun episode, based on a suggestion from the special effects teams about incorporating dinosaurs into Doctor Who. The storyline and characters were developed between Chibnall and head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat. Due to budget limitations, a wider plot had to be developed because the dinosaurs could not be the centerpiece. The dinosaurs were a mix of props and computer-generated imagery. Along with the third episode, \\"A Town Called Mercy\\", \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\" was in the first production block of the seventh series, with production commencing in early 2012 in the studio and on Southerndown beach in the Vale of Glamorgan. The episode was watched by 7.57 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot The Eleventh Doctor receives a call from the Indian Space Agency about a vast spaceship which will crash into Earth in six hours. The ISA plans to destroy it with missiles unless the Doctor stops it first. He takes Queen Nefertiti of Egypt, Edwardian game hunter John Riddell, companions Amy and Rory, and, inadvertently, Rory's father Brian. Amy discovers the ship is a Silurian ark designed to carry the reptilian humanoids to a new planet along with flora and fauna from their time period to escape a destructive impact. The ship, however, registers no Silurian life forms left on board. After escaping from a group of pterosaurs in the engine room, the Doctor, Rory and Brian are escorted by two robots to a brutal man called Solomon who has been injured in a raptor attack and requires medical help. Solomon reveals himself to be a lawless exotic black market trader who has raided the spaceship in order to steal the dinosaurs. Having had the robots murder all of the Silurians, Solomon was unable to take control of the ship himself and the computer defaulted to its point of origin, causing it to return to Earth. Discovering Queen Nefertiti's identity and value, he decides to kidnap her and leave in his own ship. Though the Doctor refuses, Nefertiti agrees to go with him to save the others. Meanwhile, the ISA proceeds to fire their missiles at the ark, against the Doctor's wishes. While Amy and Riddell shoot hostile dinosaurs with \\"anaesthetic\\" guns, the Doctor disables Solomon's robots and rescues Nefertiti, then tricks the ISA missiles into targeting Solomon's ship rather than the ark: it is destroyed, taking him with it. Rory and Brian pilot the ark away from the Earth, as the ship can only be piloted by two people of the same gene chain. The Doctor then takes Amy, Rory and Brian back home where Brian, having overcome his fear of traveling, starts a world tour (with one of his postcards showing the dinosaurs on their new home of Siluria). Nefertiti, who has been flirting and clashing with Riddell, opts to go with him rather than return to her own time. Production =Writing and casting= David Bradley was cast as Solomon, the episode's main villain. Showrunner Steven Moffat said that putting dinosaurs on a spaceship was \\"the secret of success\\". The idea to use dinosaurs in Doctor Who came from the special effects teams The Mill and Millennium FX. As \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" was a darker opening episode, \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\" is more about fun. In Moffat's pitch to writer Chris Chibnall, he proposed, \\"Maybe it's a ship heading towards Earth, and Earth is on alert\\". Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episodes \\"42\\" (2007), \\"The Hungry Earth\\"/\\"Cold Blood\\" (2010), as well as work for the spinoff series Torchwood. The Doctor had previously encountered dinosaurs in the 1974 serial Invasion of the Dinosaurs. Moffat suggested the spaceship was Silurian, and Chibnall, who had written the return of the Silurians in \\"The Hungry Earth\\"/\\"Cold Blood\\", felt that it was \\"a nice reveal and shows you more about them, even in a story that isn’t really about them\\". Chibnall suggested including a \\"bonkers\\" gang of characters picked from around time and space. He felt that Doctor Who could have \\"collisions of characters that no other show in the world can do\\", and that it was about finding a \\"disparate\\" group of characters who would \\"bounce\\" off each other. Nefertiti's decision not to return to her own time fits in with the historical record, as the date and cause of her death are unknown. Chibnall asked to introduce Rory's father, as Amy and Rory would be leaving in four episodes and Rory's family life had not been explored yet. Mark Williams who played Rory's father previously appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio adventure The Eternal Summer. Rupert Graves, who played an Edwardian hunter in this episode, previously worked with Moffat on the BBC series Sherlock. David Bradley's character, Solomon, was modelled on a \\"well-known nightclub owner with long hair\\". Chibnall described him as \\"half businessman, half Somali pirate\\". Bradley and Williams had previously worked together on the Harry Potter film franchise. Bradley was later cast as the First Doctor William Hartnell for the 50th anniversary documentary drama An Adventure in Space and Time. Comedy duo Mitchell and Webb provided the voices of Solomon's two robots; executive producer Caroline Skinner called the casting choice \\"perfect\\". Richard Hope, who played the Silurian Bleytal, previously appeared as Malohkeh in the episodes \\"The Hungry Earth\\", \\"Cold Blood\\" and \\"The Wedding of River Song\\". =Filming and effects= \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\" and the following episode, \\"A Town Called Mercy\\", were the first episodes to be produced for the seventh series, both directed by Saul Metzstein. The two episodes are Metzstein's first Doctor Who credits. The episode contains one of the biggest sets ever built for the show. The scenes in the \\"engine room\\" were filmed at Southerndown beach, Vale of Glamorgan in late February 2012. The beach had previously been used as \\"Bad Wolf Bay\\" in \\"Doomsday\\" (2006) and \\"Journey's End\\" (2008), and as the planet Alfava Metraxis in \\"The Time of Angels\\"/\\"Flesh and Stone\\" (2010). The Tricerotops prop, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. The production team had to be mindful of the series' budget when planning the effects and sets; Chibnall commented that \\"it would be very easy to spend £300m on this but we don’t have it\\". As such, the dinosaurs could not dominate the episode, and Chibnall had to tell \\"a big other story\\". The scene where Amy, Riddell, and Nefertiti stumble upon a sleeping Tyrannosaurus rex was almost cut as it was originally intended to feature computer-generated (CGI) raptors, which were too expensive. However, Millennium FX realised they could use a baby T-Rex that had been in an exhibit they designed. The episode contains a variety of \\"favourite\\" dinosaurs; some were built from scratch, while others were CGI. Smith had to wear padded trousers when riding the triceratops, and recalled it was \\"a painful couple of hours, a laugh though and definitely worth it\\". Half of the triceratops was actually built and pushed by crewmen when Smith, Darvill, and Williams were riding it. The rest of it was filled in with CGI by The Mill. The Doctor Who logo in the title sequence featured the texture of a dinosaur's hide, in keeping with the varied \\"blockbuster\\" themes for each of the opening five episodes of the series. A preview clip of the episode was released at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International. Broadcast and reception \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 8 September 2012, and on the same date on BBC America in the United States. Overnight ratings showed that it had been watched by 5.5 million viewers live in the UK. Final consolidated ratings rose to 7.57 million viewers. The episode also received 1.8 million requests during the month of September on BBC's online iPlayer, placing it second on the chart behind \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\". It also received an Appreciation Index of 87, considered \\"excellent\\". In Canada, on Space, the episode was watched by an average calculation of 575,000 viewers, making it the most watched item on the channel that week. =Critical reception= \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\" received generally positive reviews from critics, with a few detractors. Dan Martin of The Guardian described it as \\"fun\\", with praise to the expensive-looking sets and dinosaurs, the usefulness of Amy and Rory, and the concept of the gang. While he admitted it was \\"flimsy\\" and \\"pretty much a story built around a title\\", he thought it was \\"the finest episode two from Doctor Who in some time\\". However, he was unsettled by the underscore of darkness that was \\"almost disturbing enough to ruin everything\\". Similarly, Charlie Anders of io9 called it \\"the most fun I can remember Doctor Who being in years\\", while also noting gradual distancing between the Doctor and the Ponds and identifying a recurrent theme in this season: the Doctor \\"not being recognized\\". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was pleased that the \\"flawlessly realised\\" CGI dinosaurs redeemed the ones seen in Invasion of the Dinosaurs. He also praised Bradley's Solomon and the \\"fresh slant\\" of having the ark built by Silurians, rather than humans as previously seen in the programme. The A.V. Club Keith Phipps gave it a B, finding that it was formulaic but executed well. Unlike Martin, he enjoyed the dark turns. Will Barber – Taylor of The Consulting Detective, found the episode \\"A mixture between good CGI and a rather nicely paced story means that “Dinosaurs on a Spaceship” keeps you hooked to the end.\\" Dave Golder of SFX gave the episode four out of five stars, describing it as \\"slight and fluffy and silly, with the occasional creaky bit of plotting ... but enormously entertaining\\". He was pleased that the guest characters were played \\"straight\\" rather than for comedy, and found the dinosaur effects \\"great\\" and the Silurian twist \\"enriching continuity\\". However, he felt that the teaser was too fast-paced, Nefertiti was \\"rather bland\\", and wrote that it was unlikely the Doctor would have a friendship with a big game hunter. IGN's Matt Risley rated \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\" 7 out of 10, noting that it \\"isn't going to win any awards for scriptwriting or pathos, but it certainly succeeded on a family-friendly level full of whimsy\\". Though he wrote that Brian was \\"brilliant\\", he overall criticised the \\"gang\\", feeling that they \\"served little purpose other than to inject some conveniently timed plot devices when needed\\". He also did not like the \\"bickering Marvin the Paranoid Android-lite\\" robots. However, Neela Debnath of The Independent enjoyed the gang, writing, \\"the more companions there are the more variety it adds to the show because each one has their own flaws and backstory\\". Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery was more mixed, giving it three stars out of five. He described it as \\"rather over-stuffed\\", with Riddell and Nefertiti one-dimensional and under-used. He also criticised the robots and felt that the Doctor leaving Solomon to die might have been \\"a step too far\\". However, he praised the three leads and Brian, as well as the foreshadowing with Amy and Rory. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph was even more negative, only rating it two stars out of five. He described it as \\"ultimately a bit of a mess\\", calling the contrast between the \\"uneasy mix of the humorous and downright daft\\" gang and the \\"sinister\\" Solomon story \\"jarring\\". Fuller also noted that the dinosaurs were \\"a sideshow to the main plot\\". Like Morgan, he also felt that the Doctor's actions at the end would \\"sit uneasily within the viewers\\".

It was written by Toby Whithouse and directed by Saul Metzstein. The episode featured alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) visiting the Wild West, where they encounter a town which is cut off from the rest of the frontier until they hand over Kahler- Jex, an alien doctor, to a cyborg called the Gunslinger. However, the Gunslinger is a product of experiments by Jex to win a civil war on his planet, and the Doctor is unsure of what is the right thing to do. Showrunner Steven Moffat pitched the Wild West theme to Whithouse when thinking of ways to give each episode a distinct theme. Whithouse further developed the theme, including classic Western tropes and a sympathetic villain. \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" and the previous episode \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\" were the first to enter production for the seventh series. Much of the episode was filmed in March 2012 in the desert area of Almería, Spain, in Mini Hollywood and Fort Bravo, locations used for many Western-set films. Reviewers noted that the episode addressed a moral debate. \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" was watched by 8.42 million viewers in the UK. Critical reception was generally positive, with some critical of the Doctor's actions and pacing. Plot =Prequel= A prequel to \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" was released exclusively onto iTunes, and titled \\"The Making of The Gunslinger\\". It depicts the actual making and formation of the Gunslinger, from a normal humanoid body. It also has an explanation of the making of the Gunslinger in voice-over by Kahler-Jex. =Synopsis= The Eleventh Doctor, Amy and Rory arrive at the American Frontier town of Mercy. They find that no one has been able to leave or enter town due to actions of \\"The Gunslinger\\", who demands they turn over Kahler- Jex, an alien scientist that crashed to Earth years earlier. The townspeople rescued him, and in exchange, he provided them with primitive electricity and the means to stop a cholera outbreak. The town's marshal, Isaac, is hesitant of turning over his friend to the Gunslinger, despite being near the end of their supplies. The Doctor sneaks out to get the TARDIS but finds Jex's crashed ship and discovers he was one of several scientists that did inhumane experiments to create cyborgs on their war-torn homeworld. The Gunslinger arrives, and confirms the Doctor's theory that he is one of Jex's experiments. He has sought vengeance and killed all but Jex. Though he cannot harm innocents by his programming, the Gunslinger warns that Jex must be brought to him or he will take more drastic measures. The Doctor returns to town, and angrily drags Jex to face the Gunslinger. Amy asserts that the Doctor has changed for the worse from months of travelling on his own. Jex pleads that he has atoned, but the cyborg prepares to kill him. Isaac pushes Jex out of the way and takes the lethal shot. As he dies, Isaac gives the Doctor his marshal badge and has him promise to protect Mercy. The Gunslinger departs, warning he will return for Jex at noon tomorrow. Jex tells the Doctor he is remorseful for all those deaths his work has caused. The townsfolk demand the Doctor turn Jex over, but he reminds them that Isaac's death will be for naught if they do so, and has come up with a plan from learning about Jex's society. When the Gunslinger arrives the next day, residents wearing facial markings similar to Jex race through town, confusing the cyborg and allowing Jex to flee to his ship. However, instead of taking off, Jex tells the Doctor he is ready to face justice in the afterlife, and causes the ship to self-destruct. The Gunslinger with no further purpose prepares to travel a distance to self-destruct, but the Doctor suggests a new resolve. As the Doctor, Amy and Rory leave, the Gunslinger stands watch over Mercy as its new marshal. Production In looking to give each episode of the series a distinct feel, showrunner Steven Moffat pitched the Wild West theme to writer Toby Whithouse, suggesting that the episode could be about a town terrorised by a robot. Moffat was keen on putting Matt Smith in a Western setting, who he called one of the last people one would expect to replace Clint Eastwood. Whithouse had previously written the Doctor Who episodes \\"School Reunion\\" (2006), \\"The Vampires of Venice\\" (2010), and \\"The God Complex\\" (2011). Moffat had been planning for the first five episodes of the series to have \\"movie marquee\\" themes. Whithouse noted that it was a genre he had not written before, but he \\"absolutely [loved] it\\". The Wild West has not been a setting for a Doctor Who episode since the 1966 third season serial The Gunfighters. Whithouse was advised not to watch The Gunfighters by the other writers, who said it was \\"not exactly the jewel in the crown\\". Whithouse felt obliged to include common Western tropes, such as the Doctor riding a horse and a face-off. He stated the hardest scene to write was where the Doctor is forced to use a gun; the Doctor is a pacifist and he would need \\"the right sort of emotional journey\\". Whithouse preferred the cyborg villain to be three-dimensional and sympathetic, which would require it to have a \\"living consciousness\\" rather than simply be a \\"soulless automaton\\". He wanted its look to be reminiscent of Frankenstein's monster, and later called the design \\"fantastic\\". It took about three and a half hours for Andrew Brooke to have all the make-up applied. Due to the costume, Brooke had to act with just his left eye. Smith had praise for guest actors Ben Browder, who he said \\"[made] a good cowboy\\" with \\"that great drawl\\", and Adrian Scarborough, who he said \\"steals the whole episode\\". Browder was offered the role and gladly accepted; he was aware of the show as his children had watched it, and he also wanted to do a western. Whithouse was \\"thrilled\\" with Browder's performance, as it was how he imagined the character. \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" and the previous episode, \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\", were the first episodes to be produced for the seventh series, and both were directed by Saul Metzstein. The two episodes are Metzstein's first Doctor Who credits. Much of the episode was filmed around the desert area of Almería, Spain, where studios have built Wild West-style streets that have been used in the making of over 100 Western-set films, such as A Fistful of Dollars. Filming the episode in Spain was cheaper than constructing a set in the UK. Moffat stated, \\"We knew from the start we need some serious location shooting for this one, and given the most iconic American setting imaginable, there was only one place to go – Spain.\\" They reportedly filmed there from 8 March to 17 March 2012. Filming took place at Oasys/Mini Hollywood, and Fort Bravo/Texas Hollywood. While Smith was allowed to try riding the horse, most of the action shown in the episode was done by his stuntman. Composer Murray Gold mimicked Western-style scores when creating the music for the episode. Themes James F. McGrath of the religious website Patheos found that \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" had strong religious themes and moral messages, writing that it \\"really is about mercy, about forgiveness, about war crimes, about vengeance, and about justice\\". He interpreted Amy's comment about how the Doctor's behaviour was due to his being alone for too long to mean that \\"when we loosen our ties to other human beings, we can begin to treat matters of mercy and justice, and the fate of other persons, differently, impersonally\\". McGrath also noted a \\"take-home religious message\\" in the scene near the end where the town gathers in the church while the Gunslinger and the Doctor face off; he felt that it emphasised the importance of valuing human life. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph wrote that the Western concept was \\"effectively window-dressing for Toby Whithouse's powerful morality tale, where not everything was quite as it seemed and went on to explore issues of morality, ethics, conscience and justice\\". The A.V. Club reviewer Keith Phipps noted that the \\"never-ending struggle between order and chaos\\" was common in Westerns, and the episode represented this with the question of \\"what should win out: Lawless revenge or civilized justice?\\". Ian Berriman of SFX interpreted the border around Mercy as a metaphor for the Doctor nearly \\"crossing [the] line\\" and \\"[breaking] his own moral code\\". He likened the Doctor's debate to that of the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) in Genesis of the Daleks (1975) and the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) in Resurrection of the Daleks (1984). In addition, reviewers noted that the episode presented its characters with \\"shades of grey\\", rather than black-and-white villains typically seen in the show. Broadcast and reception The official poster released by the BBC for this episode, as featured on the Doctor Who website. \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One and BBC One HD on 15 September 2012 and on the same date on BBC America in the United States. Overnight ratings showed that it was watched by 6.6 million viewers live, the highest overnight figure of the seventh series thus far. It was the third most-watched programme of the day, and was also the most popular programme the next day on BBC iPlayer. It later came in third on the iPlayer chart for September with 1.4 million requests, behind the first two episodes of the series. When final consolidated viewers were taking into account the figure rose to 8.42 million, also beating \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" to be the highest rated of the series.Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e Aug 27–Sep 02, 2012\\", listed under BBC1 It also received an Appreciation Index of 85, considered \\"excellent\\". =Critical reception= \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. IGN's Matt Risely rated the episode 8.5 out of 10, calling it \\"a weighty, progressive, sumptuous and entertaining adventure\\". He praised Whithouse and Metzstein for setting the right mood and found the highlight to be the Doctor's moral uncertainty. Dan Martin of The Guardian described it as \\"a complex morality dilemma fizzing with sharp dialogue\\". He wrote that it was Karen Gillan who \\"emerged as the real star of the episode\\", citing Amy's conversation with the Doctor about how travelling alone had affected him. The A.V. Club reviewer Keith Phipps gave the episode a B+, enjoying that it spent most of the time discussing the morality issue. The Telegraph Fuller awarded \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" four out of five stars, calling it \\"an absorbing, thoughtful, adult piece of drama\\". He praised Smith's toned-down performance and his conversations with Jex. Though he also praised the \\"well-crafted\\" scene between the Doctor and Amy, he felt that the episode was \\"a waste of Gillan and [Arthur] Darvill's talents\\" as the two did not feature much. Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery also gave it four stars, commending the Western atmosphere and the way the Doctor's darkness was handled. He also found Browder to bring an American authenticy to his role that a British actor would not have accomplished. However, like Fuller, he called Amy and Rory's sidelined role \\"one of the few downsides\\". Slant Magazine reviewer Steven Cooper described it as \\"a very enjoyable episode\\", though he noted that \\"the conclusion of the story is a slight let-down after the excellence of what has preceded it\\" because the issues between the Doctor and Jex were left unresolved. Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, praised the \\"brilliant twist\\" in having Kahler-Jex be the villain rather than the Gunslinger. She found the Doctor holding Jex at gunpoint as \\"completely uncharacteristic\\", but interpreted it as foreshadowing Amy and Rory's departure. Likewise, Charlie Jane Anders from io9 felt that the Doctor's decision to let Jex die was \\"out of character\\". She criticised the Gunslinger for neither simply using its presumably advanced targeting systems to kill Jex or making the townspeople leave so that he would not have human shields. Additionally, according to her, the episode in general \\"felt [...] like a Deep Space Nine episode transplanted to the Wild West\\". SFX reviewer Ian Berriman gave \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" three and a half out of five stars. He commented that the ethical debate made it \\"a surprisingly mature story\\", but otherwise the Western tropes made it \\"occasionally feel a little over-familiar\\". He also felt it was missing \\"another twist or two\\", as most of the episode was dedicated to figuring out what to do with Jex rather than discovering more about him. Berriman also had two \\"nitpicks\\" that arose with the plot; the Gunslinger could just walk into the town and take Jex away, or the Doctor could take Jex away in the TARDIS. Dave Golder of the magazine labelled \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" as a \\"disappointing\\" science fiction Western episode, writing, \\"There are some great things about this episode ... But in a show that usually has a lot of fun reinventing TV tropes, too much of \\"A Town Called Mercy\\" feels a bit been- there, done that.\\" Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more critical, writing that he did not \\"believe\\" or \\"feel\\" it. He felt that Westerns and Doctor Who were two things that \\"never quite gelled\\" and also criticised the \\"languorous pace\\" the fact that Rory had little to do. However, he did praise the \\"gorgeous\\" set and the \\"cleverly constructed a morality play\\".

One of SNL's buses, in central Lugano. The Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano or Lake Lugano Navigation Company (SNL) is a Swiss company operating passenger services on Lake Lugano. The company also operates bus routes in the same area, and is based at Cassarate in the city of Lugano. It was formerly known as the Società di Navigazione e Ferrovie per lago di Lugano and at one time also operated railways in the area. The passenger boats of the SNL principally provide services for tourist purposes, but they also connect Lugano with other lake-side communities, in both Switzerland and Italy, some of which have no road access. The bus services connect Lugano with Gandria and Campione d'Italia, both of which are also served by boat services. SNL is a member of the arcobaleno tariff network, but only accepts arcobaleno tickets on its bus services and not on boat services. It also grants a 40% discount on all its fares to holders of arcobaleno season tickets.  History  The Società di Navigazione e Ferrovie per lago di Lugano (SNF) was formed in 1873 to construct and operate a transport link from Menaggio, on Lake Como, to Luino, on Lake Maggiore, via Lugano. Although both ends of this link were in Italy, the company was created with Swiss finance, and registered in Lugano. Previous plans were to build a railway throughout, but difficulties in financing the proposal and the substantial engineering works that would be required, led to the revised plan which was eventually implemented. This involved the construction of two unconnected railways, both entirely located within Italy. The Menaggio–Porlezza railway and the were linked by the use of steamboats, between Porlezza and Ponte Tresa on Lake Lugano, to form the desired through route. The outbreak of World War I lead to a considerable loss of traffic and financial problems, and the SNF decided to sell its railways and concentrate on operating its steamboat services on Lake Lugano. The lines were sold to the Società Varesina per le Imprese Elettriche (SVIE) in 1919. After the sale, the company changed its name to the Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano. By 1926, the company was operating nine passenger steamboats on Lake Lugano, including six paddle steamers and three screw steamers, together with two cargo motor vessels. In 1927, the passenger motor vessel Lugano was introduced, and this vessel is still in service, having been renamed Milano in 1961. The last paddle steamers in the fleet were retired in 1962. In 1908, the shipping company Vedetta SA was formed by a group of Lugano hoteliers. They ordered five steel-hulled launches from Theodore Hitzler of Hamburg. The boats served various locations around Lugano bay. The company was merged into the SNL in 1944, and their earliest vessel, the Vedetta, is still owned by the SNL.  Fleet  The SNL operates a fleet of 11 motor vessels of various ages and sizes: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! width=\\"100\\"  Name ! Built in ! class=\\"unsortable\\"  Passengers + Crew !

His works have been exhibited nationally and internationally and are in private and public collections worldwide. In 2009 the Office of Public Works in Dublin, Ireland acquired one of his artworks for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Life and career Between 1963 and 1970, he attended Arnold School in Blackpool, northern England. In 1971, he attended Roehampton Institute (London University) to study Philosophy and Art. From 1974–1986, he taught in London schools. Currently he lives part of the year on a farm in County Carlow, Ireland where his studio is located. Tim Woolcock is a supporter of Blackpool FC. Style and influences As a modern British painter Woolcock's landscapes have often been described as mystical in their composition. He has always shown an affinity with Zen and this is reflected in most of his work. The strong pigments used in his oil colour have also made his work distinctive. The London Times art critic Joanna Pitman wrote this about Woolcock's style and influences: \\"The scale and proportions of his work present an internal harmony, and this mood is completed in the delicate balance between form and the exquisite colours he uses. We see lyrical lines and geometric fragmented shapes...Woolcock has seemed to show an interest in Cubism and a wonderful sense of contour and drama. There is a meditative serenity in his colour variations which perhaps reflects the contemplative personality of Woolcock himself...his landscapes evoke the beauty and grandeur of the Irish Countryside\\" At the Paisnel Gallery Exhibition \\"Nine by Three\\" in 2016 Tim Woolcock stated \\"The execution of a painting can be startling spontaneous once I've comprehended the essence of a subject. Some of my paintings may instill different feelings in two separate viewers. Over the years I have asked collectors what motivated them to purchase my paintings and the majority replied 'the primary visual impact was the deciding factor'. I have never really attempted to manipulate my material to communicate something to an audience. I would always hope that paintings produced would evoke a spirit.

The lights inside the wristband can be controlled by a software program, which sends signals to the wristband, instructing it to light up or blink, for example. The RGB version has a white strap and can emit any colour on the visible spectrum. The single colour version is available in green, blue, yellow, red, pink, and white. The first use of Xylobands on a large scale was on Coldplay's 2012 Mylo Xyloto tour. A Xyloband was given to each member of the audience, and as the concert played, the flashing of the bands was synchronized to the music. The inventor of the wristbands, Jason Regler, stated that he had the idea for the flashing wristbands while at a Coldplay concert, during the song \\"Fix You\\". Technology The wristbands themselves are constructed of a thick fabric with LEDs inside the fabric. A radio receiver is located within a plastic case on the band, and it receives wireless signals from a controller. These signals are sent either by a handheld TV remote styled controller, which has a range of 250 meters, or a controller which is hosted on a laptop computer linked to a radio transmitter, which can remotely control the bands from up to 300 meters away. The operator of the controller or laptop software may program all wristbands or only those of certain colors to flash on and off at specific intervals and specific moments. The wristbands are not intended to be lit outside of the concert venue, although there exist anecdotes of Xylobands \\"coming back to life\\" at seemingly random times. Uses A collection of Xylobands, as they appeared during the Mylo Xyloto Tour. Coldplay's second version of the Xylobands, in use during a concert on the A Head Full of Dreams Tour. The wristbands were given to each audience member at Coldplay's 2012 Mylo Xyloto tour. As the music played, the wristbands flashed with the music to create a colorful light show in the audience, which the Washington Post referred to as a \\"psychedelicatessen of moving, multicolored lights.\\". It was wrongly reported that Xylobands were costing the band approximately €490,000 per concert. Xylobands were also prominently featured in Coldplay's \\"Charlie Brown\\" music video. Santa Cruz-based electronic music event promotion company, VitalSC, are currently offering Xylobands as part of a VIP package for their upcoming annual Dubstep music event, Wobbleland. Xylobands were also used by Cisco Systems during their Cisco Live London 2013 event. The bands were given out to attendees to wear during a keynote presentation. Attendees to the conference were also given Xylobands when attending a party on the final evening of the conference. Video of the solutions keynote speech uploaded to YouTube includes references and brief footage of the bands. It is uncertain whether or not the bands will be used by other organizations, such as sports teams. Regler and Coldplay currently have an agreement which governs the design trademark on the bands, the patent, and the intellectual property rights to the Xylobands. Regler also stated that the band would not want the Xyloband experience diluted, and that it remained to be seen if they would be marketed to other organizations. Yet, Xylobands' website beckons prospective customers to \\"put your brand on a Xyloband!\\" In early October 2013, and then again in 2015, the Chicago Blackhawks used Xylobands as a part of their banner raising ceremony to celebrate their recent Stanley Cup wins. They were used in a concert in Abu Dhabi on 31 October 2013 while Al Gasmy, and Amr Diab where performing. It was a promotion to the telecom operator DU in UAE Also used during the Jay Z concert in Abu Dhabi on 1 November 2013 by DU. Audience members began throwing their lit bands into the air and across the heads of the crowd which, although unintended, created a fascinating visual display similar to fireless fireworks. On 29 October 2014, Xylobands were given to each fan in attendance for the New York Knicks vs. Chicago Bulls at Madison Square Garden. The Xylobands were used during introductions during a short performance by the Blue Man Group. In April 2015, the New York Rangers used Xylobands as part of their pregame ceremony in the first round of the 2015 Stanley Cup Playoffs versus the Pittsburgh Penguins Xylobands were launched by RB Concepts Ltd, a company set up by entrepreneur Clive Banks with inventor Jason Regler In August 2015, a video was posted on the Xyloband YouTube page showing iPad controlling and the bands flashing in different colors. The Xylobands are used in Coldplay's tour in support of their seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams. The Xylobands were also used in April 2016, as a 'concert element' during an on-stage music recording for the closure of Michael McIntyre's 'Big Show'. In June 2016, the bands were used during the opening session of the #smaccDUB conference in Dublin, Ireland and during Coldplay's headline performance on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival 2016. The Cancer Research UK Shine Walk (25/26 September 2016) gave away Xylobands to its entrants. This fundraising walk is a half or full marathon through the streets of London overnight, and the bands fit with the theme of the event, to \\"shine\\" by wearing LEDs, EL wire, Glow Sticks and so on to light up the night.

Securities and Exchange Commission, 327 U.S. 686 (1946), is a United States Supreme Court case holding that a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) directing a public utility holding company to divest its securities of all companies except for one electric company did not violate the Commerce Clause or the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.. Background PUHCA was one of a number of trust-busting and securities regulation initiatives that were enacted in response to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression, including the collapse of Samuel Insull's public utility holding companies. By 1932, the eight largest utility holding companies controlled 73 percent of the investor-owned electric industry. Their complex, highly leveraged, corporate structures were very difficult for individual states to regulate. PUHCA required electric company holding companies to register with the SEC, and authorized the SEC to limit a holding company to a single integrated electric system through the divestiture of its other public utility and unrelated companies. The North American Company, formed in 1890, was a holding company in a system that by 1940 contained 80 companies operating in seventeen states and the District of Columbia. These included the Union Electric Company, which operated an electric system around St. Louis, Missouri, and subsidiaries in Illinois and Iowa, the Washington Railway and Electric Company, and the North American Light and Power Company with systems in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa and its subsidiaries Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Pacific Gas and Electric, and Detroit Edison Company. In addition, North American also owned an investment trust company and West Kentucky Coal Company. Together the various electric systems served more than 3,000,000 customers in a service territory of 165,000 square miles. North American initially challenged the constitutionality of PUHCA and requested an injunction against its enforcement, but the Supreme Court in Landis v. North American Co., held that the case was premature and that North American should register and then litigate the constitutionality of PUHCA after the SEC conducted its proceeding. North American then registered in 1937 as a holding company with the SEC, reserving its right to challenge the validity of the remaining portions of PUHCA. After initiating an administrative proceeding, the SEC issued an order requiring divestiture of North American's securities in companies other than the Union Electric Company. North American appealed, but in 1943 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the order. Arguing that ownership of securities was not interstate commerce within the meaning of the Commerce Clause and that the divestiture ordered by the SEC was a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment, North American appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. Opinion The opinion by Justice Murphy first concluded that North American was engaged in interstate commerce and through its substantial stock ownership dominated its subsidiaries. The opinion then noted that North American's argument that PUHCA's divestiture provision was invalid because ownership of securities was not commerce had been previously rejected by the Court in the anti-trust case of Northern Securities Co. v. United States. Under its authority under the Commerce Clause, Congress could regulate to protect the freedom of interstate commerce using any means that were lawful and not prohibited by the Constitution. Under Northern Securities, Congress could deal with and affect the ownership of securities to protect the freedom of commerce, which it did in fashioning the divestiture remedy in PUHCA. Lastly, the Court dismissed the takings argument, noting that Congress had weighed the benefit to shareholders of efficient, common management of diversified companies against the actual and potential harm to the public, investors, and consumers from the use of pooled investments, and determined that the economic advantages of a holding company atop an unintegrated, sprawling electric system were not commensurate with the resulting economic disadvantages. In addition, it was not clear that there would be a loss necessary for a takings claim under the Fifth Amendment. PUHCA does not require the dumping or forced liquidation of the securities on the market for cash, so the stock of the companies ordered divested could be distributed to the shareholders or sold under a plan that protects shareholder rights. The Court determined that it could not conclude that North American shareholders were disadvantaged by the operation of the divestiture provision of PUHCA. Justices Reed, Douglas and Jackson did not participate in the consideration of the case. Although Chief Justice Stone had initially recused himself for a disclosed reason, but when he discovered that his disqualification plus those of the other justices would result in the lack of a quorum, he reversed his position. Subsequent events PUHCA was repealed by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 effective February 8, 2006.

The Tasitolu wetlands include three saline lakes, an esplanade, and a beach; it has been designated a Wetland of National Significance. Tasitolu Peace Park was designated in 2002 because of its cultural and historical importance. The Tasitolu Important Bird Area accommodates several near-threatened species. A 2004 reforestation project, which included community member participation, was funded by the national government. Subsequent to the 2006 East Timorese crisis, several hundred people sought refuge at Tasitolu's tent camp, established by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. INTERFET, an Australian-led international military Peace Keeping Force governed by the United Nations, has established a base at Tasitolu. Geography Lakeshore 200px Red coloration, 2006. Tasitolu lies in the west of the Comoro Suco, in the Dom Aleixo subdistrict. It is part of the Dili District, which is the smallest of East Timor's thirteen districts, while being the most heavily populated, and the economic and political center of the country. Situated on the northern coast of Timor island, which is the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands, Tasitolu is on the Wetar Strait/Strait of WetarSavu Sea. It is accessed by the Dili-Kupang road. Tasitolu Bus Station is located to the north of the easternmost lake, and another transportation hub, the Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport, is away. Lying at an altitude of above sea level, the protected area (whole area: ) consists of three permanent, shallow, saline lakes, and wetland surrounds. In some years, the water of the lakes turns red, probably due to red algae. There are also headwater ridges and a beach. The beach area has several dive sites which are developed for tourists. Reef visibility is excellent, there are no currents, and the sandy bank slopes gradually. A narrow, saline esplanade is situated between the mountain and sea. Tasitolu, Areia Branca, Hera, Metinaro, and Tibar are part of a coastal wetlands network of extensive mudflat and mangrove habitats. History Some people believe that the lake water turns red because many victims of the invaders during the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999) are buried here. The fact that the last colorations occurred in the years 1975, 1999 and 2006, all years when East Timor had to cope with violent events (the Civil War and the Indonesian invasion in 1975, the crisis in 1999, and the unrest in 2006), also leads to superstition regarding the coloration. Tasitolu was at one time a popular meeting place for the ABRI; and subsequent to the 1975 invasion, many Maubere people were killed here. Church of Tasitolu Approximately from the central lake, a traditional house was built in preparation for the 1989 visit of Pope John Paul II. He arrived in October, addressing a crowd at the \\"Tasitolu Altar\\", and spoke the local Tetum language, as well as English. Subsequent to his death, a high monument dedicated to the Pope was erected in 2008; it stands on a hill on the west side of the Bay of Dili, across from a statue of Jesus Christ in Cristo Rei subdistrict on the east side. A chapel next to the statue reminds of his visit. It was at Tasitolu that in 2002, East Timor declared its independence. Tasitolu was designated by the Timor Leste Government as a Peace Park on May 20, 2002 due to its social and historical importance. Two hundred trees were planted at the Peace Park on February 12, 2004 when it was launched by President Xanana Gusmão. In recent years, an international military Peace Keeping Force base has been established at Tasitolu. During the 2006 conflict approximately 150,000 people in East Timor left their homes and sought refuge as internally displaced persons (IDP) at what became a tent camp with limited facilities at Tasitolu, one of six Transitional Shelters in Dili District. IBA (Important Bird Area) Tasitolu was established in 2007. In late October 2008, plans for a five-star hotel with 350 rooms in Tasitolu were discussed; it would be the first luxury hotel in the country, to be built in 2012 between two mountain ridges, with a 27-hole golf course situated between the lakes and a business park. During excavations for the hotel, the remains of nine people were found, victims of the Indonesian occupation. The two who wore Portuguese military uniforms, are believed to have been freedom fighters of the Falintil. Also in 2008, approximately 100 bodies were found near Tasitolu in the Delta Comorro. In September 2009, the Minister of Social Solidarity announced that Tasi Tolu Transitional Shelter would close, and that the effected families would receive assistance through recovery or reintegration packages. On the country's ten- year anniversary of independence, in 2012, Tasitolu was again the site of an historic event when the new President Taur Matan Ruak, took over the office from José Ramos-Horta. Clownfish in a magnificent sea anemone Flora and fauna A Great Egret strolling along a glassy Lake Tasitolu In addition to the salt lake, the habitat is characterized as grassland, savanna woodland, and tropical dry forest. There are stands of both mangrove and eucalyptus. Every year, hundreds of water birds from Russia arrive during the winter. Many native birds also live here, as well as fifteen restricted-range species. Populations of several near-threatened species include slaty cuckoo-dove, pink-headed imperial pigeon, olive-shouldered parrot, white-bellied bush chat, and the Timor sparrow. Cephalopod, crustacean, frogfish, harlequin ghost pipefish, small octopus, rhinopias, sea horse, and soft coral crab encompass some of the sea life. Conservation Tasitolu has been designated a Wetland of National Significance and a Peace Park. The Tasitolu protected area is under threat from human use because of the proximity to the capital city. These threats include timber collection, urban dumping, industrial rock and sand extraction, agriculture, transportation, and tourism. Nature conservation and research constitutes a major land use. As such, a 2004 reforestation project was funded by the Department of Forestry in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and included community member participation. Tasitolu was not included in the 1982 FAO/UNDP or 1989 Regional Physical Planning Project for Transmigration (RePPProT) surveys. But it was included in the 2000 United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) survey, and in 2007, it became the thirteenth area in East Timor to receive the IBA designation. Along with the country's other IBAs, Tasitolu is part of the Timor and Wetar Endemic Bird Area (EBA).Trainor, C. R., Santana, F., Rudyanto, Xavier, A. F., Pinto, P. and de Oliveira, G. F.

History From the late 1860s, Monet and other like-minded artists, met with rejection from the conservative Académie des Beaux-Arts which held its annual exhibition at the Salon de Paris. During the latter part of 1873, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, and Sisley organized the Société anonyme des artistes peintres, sculpteurs et graveurs to exhibit their artworks independently. At their first exhibition, held in April 1874, Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name, Impression, Sunrise. Among the works Monet included in the first Impressionist exhibition was The Luncheon, 1868, which features Camille Doncieux and Jean Monet. The painting was rejected by the Paris Salon of 1870.Städelsches Kunstinstitut und Städtische Galerie, Frankfurt am Main Also in this exhibition was a painting titled Boulevard des Capucines, a painting of the boulevard done from the photographer Nadar's apartment at no. 35.

(Howard) West (March 23, 1873 - January 4, 1948), was a librarian and archivist active in the United States during the early 20th century. West was elected as the Texas State Librarian in 1918, was two time President of the Texas Library Association, co-founder and first President of the Southwestern Library Association, and was the first Head Librarian of Texas Technological College (later Texas Tech University). Early years West was born to James and Mary Robertson (née Waddell) in Pontotoc, Mississippi on March 27, 1873. She lived in Mississippi into adulthood. An avid learner who was intent on attaining as much education as possible, West would go on to earn two bachelor’s and one master's degree. She received a bachelor's degree from the Industrial Institute and College in Columbus, Mississippi (now Mississippi University for Women.) She later received both a bachelor's and master's degree in history from the University of Texas at Austin where she focused on the expansion of French and Spanish settlements in North America. Upon completion of her master's degree, West initially worked as a school teacher. She first returned to Mississippi where she taught in a number of rural areas. Later, she would teach in both Bryan and Austin. She began training as a librarian in 1905 as a cataloger at the Texas State Library. West then took a position with the Library of Congress in Washington, DC in 1906 in the catalog division. Later, she would join the manuscript division of the Library of Congress where she compiled the Calendar of the Papers of Martin Van Buren in 1910 and the Calendar of the New Mexico Papers. She did not complete this latter tome as in 1911 she returned to Texas to become archivist of the Texas State Library, a position she would hold until 1915. Her first foray into library administration came in 1915, when she moved south to San Antonio to take the directorship of the San Antonio Public Library. West worked hard to develop and improve the San Antonio library. She began issuing library bulletins on a regular basis, increased holdings, offered new services to special groups, sought recognition for the library’s services in local newspapers, and began a public lecture series. Her activities not only enhanced the services and holdings of the library, they also brought attention to West herself. Word of her activities and success spread and in 1918, after only three years, West would become State Librarian for Texas. Texas State Librarian At the time of her appointment as Director of the Texas State Library, West was the first woman to ever head a department of the state government. West entered the position with the same degree of passion and enthusiasm she had shown previously in San Antonio. Over the next seven years, she would develop the state’s first library service for the blind, facilitate the development of numerous county public libraries, and to increase overall holdings. West was also notable for lobbying the state for tenure for librarian staff as well as for increased salaries for all library employees. She also worked to lessen the political control of the state library.

She had studied with Franz Boas and was a specialist in the culture and history of the Pawnee people of the Midwest Plains. Her 1965 ethnography, The Lost Universe: Pawnee Life and Culture, is considered the authoritative work on Pawnee culture to this day. She is also known for the 1943 pamphlet for the U.S. Army, called The Races of Mankind, which she co-wrote with Ruth Benedict. It was intended to educate military personnel about the cultural differences among the peoples of the world in preparation for their fighting with a variety of allies from other cultures. The authors stated that perceived differences between the races are cultural rather than biological. Among the data used in the text was an IQ study from World War I, which found higher scores among some northern Blacks in the United States forces than among some southern Whites. The pamphlet was not widely circulated within the Army, and by the early 1950s, it was banned as subversive. Engaged in social activism during the 1940s, Weltflish attracted the attention of the FBI, which suspected her (and others on the Left) of being a communist. In 1952 and 1953 she was called to Congress for questioning by two of the Senate sub-committees dedicated to investigating \\"un-American activity\\" during the 1950s red scare. Two weeks before appearing at a 1953 hearing, in which she refused to answer questions from staffer attorney Roy Cohn and Senator Joseph McCarthy as to whether she was a communist, her 16-year appointment at Columbia was terminated. She was blacklisted and unable to find an academic position for nearly a decade. During her last decade in academia full-time, she taught at Fairleigh Dickinson University. She continued to teach part-time after retirement. Biography Regina Weltfish was one of two daughters; she was born in 1902 into a German Jewish family in New York City's Lower East Side. She grew up speaking German as her first language, taught by a German governess hired by her grandfather. Her father, to whom she was very close, died when she was 13. Encouraged by her grandmother, she went to the synagogue daily to say the kaddish for him during the first year after his death, an honor and responsibility traditionally reserved for a son.Pathe, R.A. (1988). \\"Gene Weltfish (1902-1980)\\", In U. Gacs, A. Khan, J. McIntyre, and R. Weinberg (Eds.), Women Anthropologists: A Biographical Dictionary (pp. 372-381). New York: Greenwood. . p. 373 Without a father, the family was in a difficult economic situation. Because her father had died without a will, the state managed his estate and kept it in trust. Weltfish's mother had to submit formal notarized petitions for every disbursement. To help the family, at 14 Weltfish started working as a school clerk and attended high school in the evenings. =Education= Graduating from Wadleigh High School for Girls Theory and Practice: Essays presented to Gene Weltfish, edited by Stanley Diamond. The Hague, The Netherlands, Mouton Publishers, 1980 in 1919, Weltfish entered Hunter College where she majored in journalism. She transferred to Columbia University's Barnard College, where she minored in philosophy under John Dewey. She graduated from Barnard in 1925 and enrolled in Columbia's graduate program in anthropology. She had already taken courses with Franz Boas during her senior year and continued to study with him as her adviser. During this time, she married fellow graduate student Alexander Lesser, who also studied with Boas and became an anthropologist studying Siouan-speaking tribes. They were married for 15 years. Their daughter Ann was born in 1931. The two did their first field work together in Oklahoma, working on Siouan kinship systems. Happening to meet Henry Moses, a Pawnee in New York, Weltfish decided to study his tribe as the subject of her dissertation. She traveled to the reservation in Oklahoma, where tribal members still mostly spoke Pawnee language. Weltfish had not previously studied that language but learned it during her years of studies. She focused on the study of aesthetics and craftsmanship, learning the art of basket-making, which was practiced exclusively by Pawnee women. Her doctoral dissertation from Columbia was titled The Interrelation of Technique and Design in North American Basketry. She completed her dissertation in 1929, but did not formally receive her Ph.D. until 1950. At that time Columbia modified its policy requiring that grad students pay to publish dissertations (at a cost of $4,000) and began accepting copies of mimeographed theses. =Career at Columbia University= In 1935 Weltfish was invited by Boas to teach at Columbia. She stayed on a year-to-year appointment until 1953.Pathe (1988), p. 374 Among her students at Columbia was Eleanor Leacock and Vera Mae Green. Columbia University never granted Weltfish tenure, most likely because of a long-standing practice of discrimination against women. In 1938 Ruth Benedict was the first woman to achieve tenure at Columbia but did not receive a full professorship until 1948, months before her death.Benedict received tenure in 1938, after having been an assistant professor since 1931, much longer than any male academic would have had to wait. She intervened on behalf of Weltfish at a board meeting, when the trustees were considering terminating the younger woman's employment.Silverman, Sydel. (2004). Totems and Teachers: Key Figures in the History of Anthropology. Rowman Altamira p. 118 =The Races of Mankind= One of Weltfish's minor works, co-written with Ruth Benedict, had a surprisingly great effect. Published in 1943, The Races of Mankind was a pamphlet intended for American troops. It set forth, in simple language with cartoon illustrations, the scientific case against racist beliefs.Benedict, R. and Weltfish, G. (1943) The Races of Mankind. New York: The Public Affairs Committee. Inc. The publication of this pamphlet and the subsequent political furor that it caused during the 1950s, when it was decried as a piece of socialist propaganda, attracted the attention of anti-Communist authorities. The authors recounted some results of IQ tests, which were first administered to the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in World War I. At a time when whites generally believed they were mentally superior to blacks, \\"Southern Whites\\" scored below \\"Northern Negroes\\" in the IQ test. Weltfish and Benedict argued that \\"The difference....[arose] because of differences of income, education, cultural advantages, and other opportunities,\\" since southern schools spent only a fraction of the amount spent on education in the North. This statement provoked outrage among some in the military, which had many Southerners as career officers and troops. Weltfish and Benedict devoted most of pamphlet to explaining that perceived differences in group mental abilities vary in accordance with social and cultural factors, not biological ones. The pamphlet represented the Boasian way of thinking about race, which later became the standard view in anthropology and was endorsed with a 1948 UNESCO declaration. At the time, its contention that race was socially constructed was politically controversial, especially in the American South, where white Democrats had long maintained Jim Crow, racial segregation, disfranchisement of blacks, and white supremacy.Pathe (1988), p. 375 More than 20 years later, Weltfish explained why she wrote the pamphlet: Some far-right political groups in the US still consider Weltfish's work to be part of a conspiracy by Boas and his students to eliminate the study of race in psychology and anthropology in \\"preparation for the defeat of 'White Civilization' by the Jews\\".Winston, A.S.

Available: =Blacklisted during the McCarthy period= In 1953 Weltfish lost her position at Columbia University after 16 years of employment as an adjunct lecturer.Price 2004:132 notes that Pathe 1988 is in error when he states that she was fired in 1952 The FBI had been interested in her political activities for some time, and in 1944 the head of the Anthropology department Ralph Linton, who had replaced Boas in 1937, reported her to the FBI for alleged communist sympathies. The FBI investigated Weltfish's activities, noting her political engagement in the Congress of American Women, her signatures on civil rights petitions, and her appearance on the radio station WNBC.Price, David H. (2004). Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI's Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists. Duke University Press, p. 112 The FBI had classified the Congress of American Women, of which Weltfish was once president, among subversive organizations in the 1940s after its spokeswomen criticized some of President Harry S. Truman's foreign policies. In 1952 Weltfish was quoted in the Daily Worker as repeating a claim made by Soviet critics that the US Army had used germ warfare in the Korean War. Shortly thereafter she was subpoenaed to appear in the fall of 1952 before the McCarran Senate Judiciary Committee, where she was questioned. She refused to answer questions about her political affiliations, but when asked about the Daily Worker article, she said that she had been misquoted.Price (2004), pp. 123-4 In 1953 Senator Joseph McCarthy's Senate Committee on Governmental Operations was conducting hearings to determine whether un-American literature was being purchased by American libraries. Weltfish was called in for questioning regarding her role in writing the pamphlet, The Races of Mankind, which the committee had declared to be subversive. Two weeks before she was scheduled to appear, Weltfish was told by the trustees of Columbia that her employment contract would not be renewed at the end of the year. The university said she was being dismissed based on the university's adoption of a new policy against the prolonged use of annual contract-based lecturers. But, the university promoted other lecturers affected by the change to tenured positions rather than dismissing them. Weltfish maintained that she was fired because she was a woman. Later historians have concluded that she was fired because the trustees saw her as a political liability, who could threaten funding, in the tense and charged environment during the years of the red scare.Price (2004), pp. 131-2 On April 1, 1953, Weltfish was questioned by the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security staffed by Roy Cohn and consisting of senators Joseph McCarthy, Karl Mundt, John McClellan and Stuart Symington. Weltfish responded negatively to the committee's demands that she name colleagues with communist sympathies. Asked about her own political position she refused to answer, invoking the Fifth Amendment.Bosmajian, Haig. (1999). Freedom Not to Speak. NYU Press. pp. 134-5 Weltfish simply said that \\"she thought of herself as a good American and acted on issues as her conscience and knowledge dictated\\".Pathe (1988), p. 377 When asked about the nature of the claim made in the pamphlet that some northern blacks had scored higher on intelligence tests than southern whites, Weltfish responded that particular data set was from the US Army's records.Price (2004), pp. 127-8 Having lost her employment at Columbia, Weltfish was effectively blacklisted and remained unable to find a teaching position for the next eight years. The Nebraska and Bollingen Foundations gave her some financial support, which allowed her to study museum materials from the Pawnee collection at the University of Nebraska. Based on this and her previous field work, she wrote The Lost Universe: Pawnee Life and Culture (1965) about Pawnee history and ethnography.Price (2004), p. 133 =Later years= In 1961 Weltfish was hired at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, where she worked until 1972, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 70.Pathe (1988), p. 378 After her retirement from Fairleigh Dickinson, Weltfish continued teaching as a part-time faculty member at the New School for Social Research and Manhattan School of Music in New York City, and as a visiting professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. At Rutgers, she participated in a new program in gerontology. She died on August 7, 1980, just 5 days short of her 78th birthday.

Janda Pai Kapiraju was written and directed by Samuthirakani, and features Nani and Amala Paul in lead roles. The film's soundtrack and score were composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar. A second version was concurrently made in the Tamil language, titled Nimirndhu Nil, with Jayam Ravi in the main role. While the Tamil version with Jayam Ravi released in 2014, the Telugu version was released on March 21, 2015. Nani played a double role for the first time in his career. Despite already having a Tamil version, the Telugu version was dubbed and released in Tamil as Velan Ettuthikkum in 2018.https://in.bookmyshow.com/kozhinjampara/movies/velan- ettuthikkum/ET00076622 Plot Aravind Shivashankar (Nani) is a 26-year-old youth who was brought up in an ashram run by Harish Chandra (Nassar). His upbringing gives him strong moral values, but when he leaves his home, his beliefs are challenged by the corrupt social system. Unsettled by this, Aravind decides to fight immorality by taking on corrupt bureaucrats. People he becomes close with - his friend Suresh (Vennela Kishore), the lawyer Rajasekhar (Subbu Panchu), the journalist Gopi (Siva Balaji), and his girlfriend Indumathi (Amala Paul) - join him on his mission to fight corruption. They create a fake persona, Harish Chandra, based on a modified picture of Aravind, and use this to trick government officials into accepting bribes. They then successfully expose 147 officials, including Indumathi's father (Ahuti Prasad), a court judge, and an MP (Tanikella Bharani). All of the exposed officials team up, led by the MP, the judge, and Sathenapalli Savithri (Rethika Srinivas), an IAS officer, to take on Aravind and his team. They plan to use a look-alike, who fits the image and description of Harish. The look-alike is named Maya Kannan, a 42-year-old middle-aged man who does underground work for the Tamil Nadu government. He is implied to be a womanizer. The officials attempt to show that Harish is indeed a real person, in order to thwart Aravind's plan. Maya Kannan, in Tamil Nadu, accepts the deal with the government officials on the condition of receiving 14.7 crores from the corrupt officials. After learning of this plot from an employee of a government hospital, Pune (Dhanraj), also employed by the 147 members, Aravind fears that all his efforts will be in vain. He heads to Tamil Nadu to stop Kannan from claiming the made up identity of Harish, leading to a fight between the two. As the case takes place in court, Aravind and his team members are disappointed as Kannan successfully claims the identity of Harish. Just when the corrupt officials are glad that things are going as planned, there is a plot twist: Kannan explains that he was supporting Aravind from the start! The court declares in favor of Aravind, and Kannan praises Aravind for his efforts. Kannan further explains who he is - a Psychology graduate who runs orphanages and senior homes for young girls and the elderly. He explains that he used the 14.7 crores to build orphanages in four separate states. As Arvind and Kannan embrace each other and step out of the court, Kannan is stabbed multiple times and a fight breaks out. The attackers were hired by the corrupt officials to kill Aravind and Kannan. Both of them, with the help of the public, manage to fight off their attackers, and Kannan saves Aravind from being stabbed. However, Kannan eventually succumbs to his injuries with further wounds, leaving Aravind and his team devastated. The end credits explain that Aravind and his team became successful in their fight against corruption.

At that time, only the walls were left standing. In addition, the interior walls were removed to create a banquet hall for formal occasions. The towers of the palace were seen in a film in 1954. The palace is now a notable venue for award ceremonies.

Martínez held the rank of brevet Brigadier General. He was appointed governor on 30 March 1844 and took office on 29 April. He initiated various improvements in Santa Fe, for example planting trees on the plaza de armas and along the street and road leading northwest to the Rosario chapel, with a ditch to provide water for them. He also converted into plaza into a bullfight arena, with stalls for spectators. He also borrowed a press so he could start publishing a newspaper. New Mexico was a province of Mexico until 30 December 1836. It then became a department, with a departmental legislature in Santa Fe and representation in the Departmental Congress in Durango. On 17 June 1844 Governor Martínez divided the Department into three districts, Central, North and Southeast. Each district was in turn divided into seven counties. The population of the entire department at that time, including Pueblo Indians, was 67,736. At one time during his term as governor Martínez received some Ute delegates in Santa Fe. The discussion became heated, and Martínez called the guards, who killed some of the Utes. This eventually led to a full-scale war with the Utes. He was removed from office early in 1845.

Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963), was a Supreme Court of the United States case in which the Court amended United States nationality law with respect to draft evasion. Background Francisco Mendoza-Martinez (a natural-born United States citizen.) confessed to the court that he had moved to Mexico (where he also had citizenship status) in 1942 for the purpose of evading the responsibilities of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 (for which he served a year in prison). After his release from prison, Mendoza-Martinez was ordered deported on the grounds that he was not a US citizen (part of the Selective Training and Service Act, as amended by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, stripped draft evaders of their citizenship). Mendoza-Martinez charged that the penalties prescribed by Section 401(j) of the Selective Training and Service Act and by Section 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act were in violation of the due process protections granted by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The case, heard jointly with Rusk v. Cort, was appealed to the Supreme Court by United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Supreme Court decision In a five-to-four decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Mendoza-Martinez (but upheld his conviction for draft evasion), upholding the ruling by the Southern District Court of California. The two statutes in question were declared unconstitutional. Speaking for the court, Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg stated: > The imperative necessity for safeguarding these rights to procedural due > process under the gravest of emergencies has existed throughout our > constitutional history, for it is then, under the pressing exigencies of > crisis, that there is the greatest temptation to dispense with guarantees > which, it is feared, will inhibit government action. In other words, the court acknowledged the expanded powers of Congress during wartime, but also ruled that those wartime powers do not permit Congress to circumvent the measures of due process.

The causitive agent is Toxoplasma gondii, and in the United States, most cases are acquired congenitally. The most common symptom is decreased visual acuity in one eye. The diagnosis is made by examination of the eye, using ophthalmoscopy. Sometimes serologic testing is used to rule out the disease, but due to high rates of false positives, serologies are not diagnostic of toxoplasmic retinitis. If vision is not compromised, treatment may not be necessary. When vision is affected or threatened, treatment consists of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid for 4–6 weeks. Prednisone is sometimes used to decrease inflammation. Signs and symptoms A unilateral decrease in visual acuity is the most common symptom of toxoplasmic retinitis. Under ophthalmic examination, toxoplasmic chorioretinitis classically appears as a focal, white retinitis with overlying moderate inflammation of the vitreous humour. A unifocal area of acute-onset inflammation adjacent to an old chorioretinal scar is virtually pathognomonic for toxoplasmic chorioretinitis. Focal condensation of vitreous and inflammatory cells may be seen overlying the pale yellow or gray-white raised lesion in the posterior pole. Pathophysiology Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that causes a necrotizing chorioretinitis. =Congenital disease= Congenital disease occurs due to the acquisition of the organism by a pregnant woman exposed to tissue cysts or oocytes in uncooked meat or substances contaminated with cat feces. Spontaneous abortion may result if the disease is acquired during the first trimester. Congenital toxoplasmosis may lead to hydrocephalus, seizures, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, and fever. However, retinochoroiditis is the most common manifestation, occurring in 3/4 of cases. In congenital toxoplasmosis, the disease is bilateral in 65–85% of cases and involves the macula in 58%. Chronic or recurrent maternal infection during pregnancy is not thought to confer a risk of congenital toxoplasmosis because maternal immunity protects against fetal transmission. In contrast, pregnant women without serologic evidence of prior exposure to Toxoplasma should take sanitary precautions such as having someone else clean and maintain litter boxes and avoiding undercooked meats. Diagnosis In most instances, the diagnosis of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis is made clinically on the basis of the appearance of the characteristic lesion on eye examination. Seropositivity (positive blood test result) for Toxoplasma is very common and therefore not useful in diagnosis; however, a negative result i.e. absence of antibodies is often used to rule out disease. Others believe that serology is useful to confirm active toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis, not only by showing positivity but by also showing a significant elevation of titers: The mean IgG values were 147.7 ± 25.9 IU/ml for patients with active disease versus 18.3 ± 20.8 IU/ml for normal individuals. Antibodies against Toxoplasma: * IgG : appear within the first 2 weeks after infection, typically remain detectable for life, albeit at low levels;and may cross the placenta. * IgM : rise early during the acute phase of the infection, typically remain detectable for less than 1 year, and do not cross the placenta. * IgA : Measurement of IgA antibody titers may also be useful in a diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis in a fetus or newborn because IgM production is often weak during this period and the presence of IgG antibodies may indicate passive transfer of maternal antibodies in utero. IgA antibodies however usually disappear by 7 months. In atypical cases, ocular fluid testing to detect parasite DNA by polymerase chain reaction or to determine intraocular production of specific antibody may be helpful for establishing etiology. Neuroimaging is warranted in AIDS patients presenting with these findings because intracranial toxoplasmic lesions have been reported in up to 29% of these patients who have toxoplasmic chorioretinitis. Prevention Quarterly precipitation and toxoplasmic reactivation of retinochoroiditis in Argentina Toxoplasma infection can be prevented in large part by: * cooking meat to a safe temperature (i.e., one sufficient to kill Toxoplasma) * peeling or thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables before eating * cleaning cooking surfaces and utensils after they have contacted raw meat, poultry, seafood, or unwashed fruits or vegetables * pregnant women avoiding changing cat litter or, if no one else is available to change the cat litter, using gloves, then washing hands thoroughly * not feeding raw or undercooked meat to cats to prevent acquisition of Toxoplasma Prolonged and intense rainfall periods are significantly associated with the reactivation of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Changes promoted by this climatic condition concern both the parasite survival in the soil as well as a putative effect on the host immune response due to other comorbidities. Treatment Small extramacular lesions (lesions not threatening vision) may be observed without treatment. Sight-threatening lesions are treated for 4–6 weeks with triple therapy consisting of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. During treatment with pyrimethamine, leukocyte and platelet counts should be monitored weekly. Folinic acid protects against the decrease in platelets and white blood cells induced by pyrimethamine. Prednisone may be used for 3–6 weeks to reduce macular or optic nerve inflammation and can be started on day 3 of antibiotic therapy. Corticosteroids should not be used without concurrent antibiotic treatment or in immunocompromised patients due to the risk of exacerbation of the disease. Currently, there is no published evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that corticosteroids would be an effective adjunct for treating ocular toxoplasmosis. Trimethoprim- Sulfamethoxazole has been shown to be equivalent to triple therapy in the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis and may be better tolerated. Clindamycin and azithromycin can also be considered as alternative therapies. Spiramycin may be used safely without undue risk of teratogenicity and may reduce the rate of transmission to the fetus. AIDS patients require chronic maintenance treatment.

Rózmann was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 16 July 1939. He studied composition with Rezső Sugár at the Bartók Béla Secondary School of Music between 1957 and 1961. From 1961 on, he attended the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, studying composition with Endre Szervánszky and organ with Sebestyén Pécsi. He graduated in both subjects in 1966. After gaining his diplomas, he worked as a teacher of score reading at the Teacher’s College of the Liszt Academy in Szeged. At the end of the sixties, he composed film music for Mafilm (Hungarian Film Studios). His Improvisazione for flute and piano was published in 1971 by Editio Musica Budapest. In 1971, he went to Sweden for postgraduate studies of composition. His teacher was Ingvar Lidholm at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. In the College studio, he discovered the tools of electroacoustic music making. He also started to work in Elektronmusikstudion (EMS, the Stockholm Electroacoustic Music Studio). The first result of his experiments was Impulsioni, a cycle of short electronic pieces from 1974, which won third prize at the Bourges Concours International de Musique Électroacoustique in 1976. After finishing his studies at the Royal College of Music in 1974, Rózmann settled in Stockholm, spending the rest of his life in and near the Swedish capital. From the seventies on, he thought of recorded electroacoustic music as the only suitable medium for his creative ideas. His first conspicuous public appearance as a composer was the premiere of Bilder inför drömmen och döden (Images of Dream and Death) on 9 March 1978. The concert was held in Cirkus, a large event hall in Stockholm. From 1978 for nineteen years he was organist at the Stockholm Catholic Cathedral. Here he met the choir-leader and musicologist Viveca Servatius, who later became his life partner. 1978 also saw the beginning of his second large-scale work, Tolv stationer (Twelve Stations), the first one to use recorded sounds of acoustical origin (while the previous two used entirely synthetic material). Its composition engaged Rózmann until as late as 2001, resulting in a work with a playing time of more than six hours. The first parts were premiered in the Stockholm Culture House in 1984. In 2014 Editions Mego records released a 7-CD box set of the entire series of the Stations. In the early eighties, Rózmann started to build a private electroacoustic studio which he installed in the basement of the Catholic Cathedral. Besides, he continued to work in EMS where he remained a frequent visitor until the end of his life. Between 1980 and 2005, he composed a series of eight electroacoustic works, each with the title Orgelstycke (Organ Piece). Sounds from his main instrument, the organ, were his much appreciated basic material, besides the human voice and the sounds of bowed zither and prepared piano. Rózmann’s third piece of epic length, Rytmer och melodier (Rhythms and Melodies) was composed in 1987 and premiered in the Berwald Concert Hall in 1988. In 1990, a series of three author’s nights dedicated to Rózmann was held in the Stockholm centre for contemporary music, Fylkingen. Six of his pieces were played on that occasion, three of them for the first time. While almost all of his nearly thirty compositions were performed in Sweden in his lifetime, only one was played in public concert in his native country, Hungary. Trumpetmusette was composed for the Budapest Electroacoustic Music Festival of the Hungarian Radio, and was premiered there in 1994. In 1997 he left his service of the Catholic Cathedral and moved with his private studio to Skogås, a suburb of Stockholm. It was in the same year that he finished one of his most concentrated works, De två med tre instrument (Two, with Three Instruments). In January 2005 he completed his last work, Orgelstycke nr III/a (Organ Piece Nr. III/a), going back to an idea conceived in the eighties. In February he still lived to see one of his biggest and most celebrated concerts. During five consecutive afternoons of the Stockholm New Music festival, were played his huge Gloria cycle preceded by Orgelstycke nr IV (Kyrie eleison), under the collective title Mässa (Mass). The Gloria cycle, an extensive musical setting of the corresponding liturgical text, was composed between 1989 and 2004, and requires some seven hours to perform. In summer 2005 Rózmann was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died on 12 of August. In accordance with his own wish his ashes were scattered to the wind. The uncompromising nature of Rózmann's character can easily be traced both in the reports about his behaviour and in his music. As a fervent devotee of his work, he shut himself up in windowless studios for hours, often working until late in the night. In his late years he didn’t participate in the events of official musical life, he didn’t even attend his own premieres. In his work, he looked neither for the approval of the professional, nor for the pleasure of the audience. The only thing that counted was the perfect articulation of his vision. This vision was inspired by the (recorded) sound itself, originating from many different sources. As this raw material had been worked out and made to be specially plastic, an extremely powerful drama evolved, especially in Rózmann’s large-scale works. A drama that reproduces the most basic conflicts of human existence, gives a shocking insight to its darkest depths, and shows that sin and purity, darkness and light walk side by side, their qualities mutually presupposing each other. The play is often elaborated in a symbolical and pictorial way with quotations from Buddhist and Christian liturgical music on one side, violent clashing, snarling and devilish laughter on the other. Put between these forces, the cry of the struggling human soul is heard.

History  The Pediatric Rheumatology Hospital E. Stoeber, L. Sänger: Zur Geschichte der Kinderklinik und Rheumakinderklinik in Garmisch- Partenkirchen, 1992Jane Schaller: The History of Pediatric Rheumatology, Pediatric Research 2005;58:997-1007 evolved out of a pediatric facility for treating tuberculosis. Dr. Elizabeth Stoeber, the first chief of medicine, was able to use funds from the Marshall plan to convert the facility to a full pediatric hospital. Initially, mainly patients with rheumatic fever were treated. However, by the end of the decade focus shifted towards patients with Still's disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The Pediatric Hospital of the Inner Mission in Garmisch-Partenkirchen with the newly constructed rheumatology wing, approx. 1965 With increasing availability of steroids and non-steroidal antirheumatic drugs as well as the addition of facilities for physiotherapy, the 1960s saw the development of a program for the therapy of the often severely impaired and handicapped children. In addition, hospital schooling starting in 1952 was developed into a full hospital school by 1975. Donation from various sources, especially the German branch of the Lions Club allowed significant expansion of the facilities.http://www.lions-bayern- sued.de/hilfe-fuer-das-rheumakranke-kind.html By 1971, a new hospital building was inaugurated, including a gymnasium and exercise pool. The 1980s saw international recognition of pediatric rheumatology as a subspecialty with increasing competition from outpatient clinics in university hospitals. The Pediatric Rheumatology Hospital continued with a focus on clinical work and physiotherapy.Second Workshop on Physiotherapy in JCA (Garmisch- Partenkirchen), Rheumatology 1993;32(5):425 Modifications to the building created more space for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and balneotherapy. At the same time, social support was improved by obtaining a house nearby providing lodging and other facilities to families of inpatients. In 2004, the general hospital wing was moved to the newly constructed Garmisch General Hospital. The Pediatric Rheumatology Hospital, renamed the 'German Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology', was now the only facility in Europe exclusively dedicated to treating rheumatic diseases in childhood. Starting in 2002, the hospital building was renovated in several stages. As the Inner Mission sold the hospital in 2010, the Pediatric Rheumatology Hospital was taken over by the chief of medicine, Professor J.-P. Haas with the help of private investors.  Structure of the Hospital  The Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology today The Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology treats children and adolescents with rheumatic diseases including juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but also systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile dermatomyositis, scleroderma and other connective tissue disorders. Patients, originating mostly from Germany, but also a significant number of international patients, are mainly treated as inpatients. A smaller part of patients is also treated on an outpatient basis. Children and adolescents with chronic pain syndromes are treated in a specialized ward setting. Also integrated into the hospital are outpatient facilities for pediatric cardiology and developmentally delayed children.  The Garmisch Treatment Concept  The Pediatric Rheumatology Hospital uses a team-based approach with a multidisciplinary treatment concept. The basis of this concept is to treat the child or adolescent as individual, using five 'columns': medical therapy, nursing therapy, physical therapy, psychosocial and educational therapy and the hospital school. Using these columns, an individual treatment concept is tailored to the needs of the patient during his stay.

The new construction company Haka Oy finished the hotel in May 1972.

The truck, which shares its 815.000 engine and some other mechanicals with the Lancia Flavia, is the successor of the Appia-based Lancia Jolly. The 1½ ton Superjolly has a longer wheelbase than its predecessor. The little truck was produced from 1963 to 1970 in Turin, Italy. The first model (315.000) was produced in 1674 examples, while 1272 of the 1.8-litre 315.024 model meant that overall production was 2948. The Superjolly has front-wheel drive with independent suspension, meaning that the loading area is uncommonly low. The subframe and drivetrain of the Flavia were used, with some modifications to handle heavier work, but the Superjolly also utilized parts from the Appia, Fulvia, and Flaminia ranges. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, although later models had the Flavia's fully synchronized four-speed. The front suspension setup is similar to the Flavia's, independent double wishbone with a single (albeit heavier duty) transverse leaf spring. The track is rather than 1300 as on the Flavia, while the leaf sprung live rear axle is wide.Rudler, p. 6 Engines The engine was originally a 1.5-liter flat-four cylinder, and with it has considerably more power than does the Jolly's V4 engine.

Born into a prominent and long-standing London family, Adams inherited a baronetcy when young, and went on to have a successful career at sea. He was promoted to lieutenant during the Seven Years' War, and within two years was commanding a ship of his own. He was captain of several frigates, and went out to the East Indies with one. He had some success against French and Spanish shipping, capturing privateers, before being sent to Newfoundland after the end of the war. Here he made the acquaintance of Constantine Phipps and the naturalist Joseph Banks, and also met the future explorer James Cook, who was conducting surveys of the Newfoundland coast at the time of Adams' visit. Adams returned to Britain and was given command of a new ship. He returned to North America with her, but died while in command of her. The baronetcy he had inherited became extinct on his death. Family and early life Thomas was baptised in Old St. Pancras Church on 17 February 1738.The Environs of London: Pancras 1795 Adams was the son of Sir Robert Adams, a solicitor in the city of London, and his second wife, Diana. Thomas was the eldest of two sons by his father's second marriage, having a younger brother named William. The Adams were an important London family, with Thomas' great-grandfather, Sir Thomas Adams, having served as Lord Mayor of London and a Member of Parliament, for which he was created a baronet. Robert Adams inherited the baronetcy on the death of his elder brother Charles, and when Robert died circa 1754, it passed to his son Thomas. Thomas was baptised on 17 February 1738 at St Pancras Old Church. Thomas Adams embarked on a naval career, and was commissioned as lieutenant on 8 June 1757, during the Seven Years' War. He was advanced to commander within a few years, taking over the ketch in November 1759. A further promotion followed on 17 August 1760, when he was advanced to post-captain. After this he was appointed to command the 24-gun . Command Adams was employed on the home station, cruising against enemy warships and privateers. He had relatively few successes during his time in command, though he did manage to capture the French privateer Brimborion off the Isles of Scilly on 8 August 1761. Brimborion was out of Dieppe, and was armed with one carriage gun and twelve swivel guns and had a crew of 35. She had been cruising for two weeks and had captured two sloops and a snow. Adams carried her into Plymouth. After his arrival there he received orders to sail to the East Indies, departing England on 23 May and returning in July 1762. Adams was moved from command of Terpsichore shortly after his arrival, and instead appointed to the newly built 32-gun . He commanded her during the blockade of the Basque Roads and on 29 November 1762 he captured the 10-gun Spanish vessel Pacto de Familia. The signing of the Treaty of Paris in February 1763 ended the Seven Years' War and Boston was paid off in March. Adams was not long without a ship, having received an appointment that month to take over the 32-gun . Niger was initially employed off the west coast of Scotland, around the Isle of Arran, in 1764, and it was about this time that Adams appears to have married the Hon. Frances Warter-Wilson in Dublin. In early 1766 he was ordered to Newfoundland. Also on board for the voyage were Constantine Phipps, and the botanist Joseph Banks, while Adams had James Burney with him as his servant. The purpose of the journey was to transport a party of mariners to Chateau Bay to build a fort, to continue strengthening relations with the native population, and to survey some of the coast of Newfoundland. During his time in Newfoundland Adams met James Cook, who was engaged in surveying the coast, and introduced him to Banks. Later life Adams returned to England in 1767 and paid off Niger. He was without a ship until August 1769 when he recommissioned his former command, HMS Boston, which had just completed a refit. He was sent out to North America again. He died in command of Boston while on the Virginia station in April 1770. His will was proven in November 1770, which described him as a bachelor, implying his wife had died. That he died without issue and that his younger brother William had presumably predeceased him, is shown by the fact that the baronetcy became extinct on his death. Notes a. Sources disagree on the date of his death. Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History gives a date of 12 April, while Charnock's Biographia Navalis has 16 April. Citations References *Biography.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as an example of a large-scale company housing project. The building is located at the corner of Union and Main Streets, in the southern part of the historical center of Windsor. History The National Acme Company (NAMCO), formed after the National Acme Manufacturing Company acquired the Windsor Machine Company, was the main employer in the town of Windsor between 1915 and 1930. The success of NAMCO was at a large extent dependent on its ability to attract the workforce from outside Windsor. The block represents the approach to urban settlement which is based on family housing in contrast to housing of single men, the predominant approach at the time. The property on the northern bank of the Mill Brook, where the block is currently located, was purchased by the Windsor Machine Company in the late 1880s. A new plant was constructed nearby in 1909, and a club and a dormitory for the workers was constructed on the site. The club was badly damaged by fire and demolished in the middle of the 1910s, which caused a housing shortage. At the time, the number of workers at the plant was around 1600. The new apartment block was constructed in order to replace the lost housing. The location was chosen close to the plant as there was no public transportation in Windsor, and the use of cars was restricted in winter by the climate conditions. The contract to build the block was awarded to Massachusetts-based L. A. Lafrance company and started in the spring of 1920. By the time of completion in 1922, the NAMCO block was the biggest residential building in northern New England. In 1933, during the Great Depression, the Winsdsor facility of NAMCO was closed down. In 1989, the building was rehabilitated and currently hosts low-income housing. Architecture The block is made of brick and has a flat roof. It is composed of nine identical four-storey buildings containing eight apartments each (two apartments at each floor), so that the whole complex contains seventy-two apartments. The buildings are separated by a fire wall. The main facade faces Union Street. The facade is separated into nine buildings as well, by using the bow fronts. Each individual building has an entrance from the main facade. Inside, the floors are connected by straight-run stairs. The building incorporates colonial revival features, including the red brick walls and flat-arched windows. Most of the apartments consist of a living room, a dining room, a bedroom, a kitchen and a bathroom. The fourth-floor apartments are slightly different and have two bedrooms each. Two of the apartments have been adapted for handicap access.

The locals are adept at casting, trolling, fly fishing, bottom- fishing, bone fishing and spear fishing, as well as teaching angling to tourists. Among the fish caught are barracuda, tuna, tarpon, trevally, marlin, wahoo, sailfish, grouper, billfish and snapper.

As a member of the HSS, Košutić traveled through Europe and United States to inform the world public about the Serb hegemonist policy of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the \\"Croatian issue\\". Because of his activity he was often arrested by the Yugoslav authorities, and in 1924 he was a victim of an assassination attempt. Briefly between the 1926 and 1927 he was a Minister of Construction where he made a great effort combating the corruption. During the World War II, in the Independent State of Croatia, he was most notable for his participation in the abortive Lorković-Vokić plot in 1944, a coup which had the goal of establishing a coalition government between the Ustaše and the HSS and align the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) with the Allies. After the war, he became politically inactive. Early life Košutić was born in Radoboj, near Krapina, in the Croatian region of Zagorje. His father Stjepan was HSS commissioner for Krapina region and he often met with Antun and Stjepan Radić, leaders of the HSS, so young August had a chance to listen to their conversations. After graduating from the elementary school, August entered the Zagreb gymnasium, where he was an excellent student. Because of that, he was entrusted with school library. Soon, August learned to write a stenography, so he was invited to work for the Sabor (Croatian parliament), where he started a close relationship with Stjepan Radić, who was also his godfather at his chrism, when Radić gave him all of his published works. Young Košutić spent a lot of time in Radić's home to help him with writing and redaction of his articles, brochures and books. Košutić entered the Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb, but because of World War I, he stopped his study as he was invited to join the army. At the beginning of war he was an artillery officer, but later joined the air force school and he saw the end of the war as an air force officer. After the war, attended a technical school in Brno in Czechoslovakia, where he graduated and become an engineer, but where he also worked as an assistant. Soon, he returned to Croatia to work within the HSS, and in 1921 he married Radić's daughter Mira. Kingdom of Yugoslavia =Activity within the HSS= When the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created, its Prime Minister became Nikola Pašić, who enforced centralism and hegemonist rule, often accompanied by terror. Radić and Košutić travel aboard to inform the world public about the violent policy of Belgrade. Even though Košutić had immunity as member of parliament, authorities took his passport and forbade him to travel aboard, so he crossed the border illegally; in 1923 he was with Radić in London, later he went from Vienna to Zagreb where he was sent by Radić to inform the Croatian public about the image which was created about Croatia in the world. From Vienna, Košutić accompanied Radić on his way to Moscow to meet Georgy Chicherin, the Soviet foreign minister who wanted to meet Radić. Košutić continued to travel aboard, and as such, he bothered the Serbian authorities. In 1924, while he was holding a speech, in order to assassinate him, Jovo Gnjatović, a Serb, stuck him with a gunstock in his head. Košutić soon recovered, even though the doctors claimed he wouldn't; when he returned to Zagreb he was arrested. =Member of government= In 1926, Košutić was named undersecretary in the Ministry of Traffic and on 24 December 1926, Košutić was named Minister of Construction in the government of Nikola Uzunović, but after the stood down with the Radical Party, the HSS left the coalition on 1 February 1927. As a Minister of Construction, Košutić fought the corruption, which was highly present in this ministry, and illegal trading of properties. His ministry made a heavy blow to the corruption. =Activity before the implementation of a dictatorship= In 1927, after the HSS left the government, the new election was announced. For the HSS' political campaign, Košutić traveled to Macedonia, where the HSS had a lot of supporters, but he was arrested by police and transferred to Belgrade. Nevertheless, he continued to travel in Montenegro, Herzegovina, and South Croatia. In June 1928, Puniša Račić executed an assassination, killing few prominent members of the HSS and mortally wounding its leader, Stjepan Radić in the parliament. As a close associate of Radić, Košutić was one of his possible successors as president of the HSS after Radić died from wounds which he suffered during an assassination attempt in 1928. =Emigration= In August 1929, seven months after Alexander I of Yugoslavia imposed a royal dictatorship, Košutić emigrated, at first to Zürich, but after invite of the American branch of the HSS, he left for the United States in 1930. Immediately after he left the country, he was accused of stealing a few million Yugoslav dinars. This unabled his political activity in the United States, so he returned to Europe. In May 1930 Košutić and his party colleague Juraj Krnjević wrote a memorandum which they presented to the League of Nations outlining the disproportionate impact of king's decrees in Croatia. The memorandum also spoke of cultural domination, Croatia's lack of representation after suspension of political parties, of harsh treatment at the hands of \\"bureaucrats appointed by the absolutist king of Serbia,\\" and the disproportionate application of the Law for Defence of the State in Croatia. Košutić and Krnjević also traveled in Geneva, London, Paris and to the United States as well. In 1931, American authorities concluded that the accusation was false and the charge was dismissed, so in Berlin, Košutić found out that he may return to the United States. He travelled across the United States to inform the Croatian emigration about the situation in Yugoslavia, counting on their help. After that, in March 1932, he went to Vienna, where he criticized Belgrade regime for corruption. From Vienna he continued to travel across the Europe to hold lectures and speeches. On 14 November 1932, on invitation of the British Royal Institute of International Affairs, Košutić held a speech about the \\"Croatian issue\\", and soon he left the significant impact in the diplomatic world when his speech was published by the Royal Institute. =Returnal to Yugoslavia= In 1934, King Alexander was killed by Ustaše in Marseille and was succeeded by Prince Paul, for whom Košutić claimed that he is a man of culture, and ulike Alexander, a friend of Croats. Košutić returned to Yugoslavia in 1937, when he was elected member of parliament. When the Banovina of Croatia was established on 24 August 1939, Maček sought the appointment of Košutić as Ban of Croatia, however, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia opposed Maček's proposal and chose Ivan Šubašić for the role. At the beginning of the 1930s, Košutić had been appointed Vice President of the HSS, while its president was Vladko Maček, who succeeded Radić. In the name of Maček, he led the negotiations with Dušan Simović, a Yugoslav general that led the military coup in 1941 which led to the abandonment of the Tripartite Pact. The negotiations were about the HSS' entry into Simović's government; recognition of the Tripartite Pact; appointment of two co-regents of which one would be Croat and removal of the Serb military from politics. Maček feard a coup by Croat separatists who sought to exploit the widespread Croat resentment against the Serbs for the coup and force a break with Belgrade. Soon afterwards, Yugoslavia was attacked by Germany and its allies and was quickly defeated. Independent State of Croatia The Axis-allied state, the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), was established on 10 April 1941. Not long after the NDH was established, Košutić was detained in prison for three days and released without hearing. Again, he was arrested on 6 May and kept in prison until 20 August, when he was released but placed under house arrest. For the third time, he was arrested on 29 August 1942, and in September, along with another sixty members of the HSS who were pre-war members of parliament and leaders of the party, he was detained in Lepoglava prison on suspicion that he had collaborated with the Yugoslav Partisans. Together with all sixty members of the HSS, he was released on 23 December 1942. When Maček was arrested, Košutić remained in Zagreb with about six of the remaining HSS leadership, and became the de facto leader of the HSS. In early 1943, while Maček was under house arrest, Košutić along with an interim HSS leadership team including senior members Ivanko Farolfi and Ljudevit Tomašić re-commenced political activity with the assumption that the Western Allies would soon land on the Dalmatian coast and would win the war. This activity included circulating leaflets promoting Maček as the only Croat acceptable to the Allies, and attempting to make contact with them. They also made contact with sympathetic officers of the Home Guard. In order to expand the base for the Ustaše and to strengthen the Ustaše leadership, Ante Pavelić discussed forming a coalition government with Košutić and at the same time, weakening the Partisans. The negotiations took place between 1943 and 1944, but HSS leadership at the end, refused Pavelić's proposal to enter the government. Again in the middle of 1944, the negotiations were renewed on the initiative of the Minister of Interior, Mladen Lorković, ending with the Lorković-Vokić plot and imprisonment of the leaders of the coup when one fraction among the Ustaše and the nationalist wing of the HSS were defeated. At the same time, Košutić negotiated with the Communist Party of Croatia through Ivo Krbek, also a HSS member and former Deputy Ban of Croatia. Those negotiations were initiated by London, with goal to gain the support from the Croatian Home Guard in possible invasion of the Croatian Adriatic coast. On 1 September 1944, Pavelić invited him on conversation, but Košutić feared he would be manipulated by the Ustaše and joined the Partisans along with Radić's youngest son Branko. Communist Yugoslavia Not long after he joined the Partisans, the communists arrested him and kept him imprisoned until 6 September 1946. After he was released, he became politically inactive and advocated that HSS should also freeze its activities in order to avoid arrests by the communists. He thought that the HSS needed to maintain its political strength and wait for the communist government to agree on concessions, which he believed would happen very soon due to an internal conflict within the Communist Party, which occurred after the Tito-Stalin split, and the crisis with the Western powers due to the border disputes over the Free Territory of Trieste. Many members of the HSS thought that Košutić made some sort of an agreement with the communists, so the leaders of the HSS, Juraj Šutej, Tomo Jančiković, Franjo Gaži, Božidar Magovac and Ivan Šubašić opposed his idea about the inaction. Košutić died in Zagreb.

One scholar who has done extensive research presents and discusses the available evidence and concludes that Niguma was indeed Naropa's older sister, not his wife or consort.Sarah Harding. Niguma, Lady of Illusion. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. pp. 3-6 Previous incarnations Niguma was considered an emanation of the great dakini Mandarava, Guru Rinpoche's foremost Indian disciple.Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters. Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. . Teachers There is almost no information about Niguma's teachers in the extant sources. As one scholar writes: Thus, from the perspective of the spiritual lineage, it is said that Niguma's spiritual realization originates directly from the Buddha Vajradhara, rather than from any living human teachers.Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters. Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 227. .Sarah Harding. \\"Seeking Niguma: Lady of Illusion.\\" http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Niguma (2010). Accessed 5-7-16. Notable students and the transmission of Niguma's lineages =Sukhasiddhi= There is some evidence that the great dakini and Vajrayana teacher Sukhasiddhi may have been a student of Niguma's. Other evidence indicates that they may never have met even while living during the same time period. Both Niguma and Sukhasiddhi were teachers of Khyungpo Neljor, and both Niguma and Sukhasiddhi are credited with the formation of the Shangpa Kagyu lineage of Vajrayana Buddhism. =Marpa Lotsawa, or Marpa the Translator= The great meditation master and translator, Marpa Lotsawa received teachings from Niguma on at least two occasions. Marpa is said to have visited Niguma each time he traveled to India. Sources say that he sought out Niguma on the advice of Naropa.Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters. Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 227. .Sarah Harding. Niguma, Lady of Illusion. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 5 The story is told thusly, in The Life of Marpa: Another source says that Marpa's first visit to Niguma was suggested by Naropa and that a later visit to Niguma was suggested by Shantibhadra. During the first meeting, Marpa received the Catuhpitha empowerment and instructions. During his second visit with Niguma, he received prophecy about meeting Naropa again, even though Naropa had already died.Sarah Harding. Niguma, Lady of Illusion. Snow Lion Publications. 2010. p. 5-6 =Khyungpo Neljor= Niguma had many important students during her lifetime. The Tibetan meditation master Khyungpo Neljor () stands out both for his intensive travel to seek teachings and transmissions from qualified masters and also for receiving the entire corpus of teachings from Niguma that would become the basis of the Shangpa Kagyu lineage. Khyungpo Neljor traveled to Nepal and India seeking teachings and transmissions from a variety of teachers, including Niguma.Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters. Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 227. Some of Niguma's realization, and teaching style, can be seen in the description of Khyungpo Neljor meeting Niguma for the first time. While in India studying with various teachers, Khyungpo Neljor asked those he met if there were any teachers who had met the Buddha Vajradhara. He was told that Niguma had. So, he sought out Niguma in order to receive even higher levels of teaching from her. He found the dakini Niguma in the Sosa charnal ground of eastern India.Alexander Gardener. Kungpo Neljor.http://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Khyungpo-Naljor/6285. Accessed 5/7/16http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eight_great_charnel_grounds It is traditional for a student to request teachings and transmissions three times before they are bestowed. When Khyungpo Neljor first requested transmissions, Niguma is said to have replied in the code-language of the dakinis: \\"I am a flesh-eating dakini!\\" One source says that she claimed to be the queen of the cannibals.Kongtrul, Jamgon; Zangpo, Ngawang (2003). Timeless Rapture: Inspired Verses of the Shangpa Masters. Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. p. 227. Finally when Khyngpo Neljor again asked for transmissions, Niguma demanded gold from him. He had been traveling with great amounts of gold in order to make offerings to any teacher he met. When he offered the gold to Niguma, she threw it up into the air and it scattered throughout the forest. Then, Khungpo Neljor then returned to Tibet, and established a monastery at Zhangzhong in the Shang region in western Tsang. This was his main seat, and he became known as the Lama of Shang. Although he was reputed to have founded hundreds of monasteries and had thousands of students, he passed the teachings of Niguma to only one of his students, Mochok Rinchen Tsondru. The Shangpa lineage is often referred to as the \\"secret lineage\\" because Niguma instructed Khyungpo Neljor to transmit the teachings to only one student for the first seven generations beginning with Vajradhara and Niguma. Niguma then passed the lineage to Khyungpo Neljor who passed it to Mokchokpa Rinchen Tsondru (1110-1170). After that, Niguma's lineage went to Wonton Kyergngpa (or Chokyi Senge, 1143-1216), Sangye Nyenton (or Rigongpa, 1175-1247/1255?), and Drogon Sangye Tonpa (1207-1278). At this point, the lineage stream was opened up and teachings and practices were given to many others.Sarah Harding. Niguma, Lady of Illusion.

Here are both songs to Niguma and songs by Niguma. =The Six Dharmas of Niguma or The Six Yogas of Niguma?= Niguma brought forth a tantric sadhana cycle, a cohesive set of spiritual practices, referred to properly as the Vajra Lines of the Six Dharmas, sometimes also referred to as the Six Yogas of Niguma. This is a parallel to the more well known Six Yogas of Naropa. Yet, for both Niguma's and Naropa's Vajrayana sadhana cycles, it is more accurate to use the term six dharmas. The Six Dharmas of Niguma are classified as completion stage (rdzogs rim) practices focusing on controlling and refining the channels, winds, and energies of the subtle body. Details of the sadhana cycle brought forth by Niguma can be found in Selected Works of the Dalai Lama: The Tantric Yogas of Sister Niguma compiled, edited, and translated by Glenn H. Mullin, 1985, Snow Lion Publications.

Nison L. Alpert, ed. Judaica Press, 1974, pp. xii-xxiii. was a prominent Polish Orthodox Jewish rabbi, communal activist, educator, journalist, and Torah scholar. He was the founding editor of the first Agudath Israel Hebrew journal, Digleinu (Our Banner), and author of Ma'ayanah shel Torah (Wellsprings of Torah), an anthology of commentaries on the weekly Torah portion, which is still popular today. He was incarcerated in the Warsaw Ghetto and deported to the Trawniki concentration camp, where he was selected for deportation to the death camps and murdered around November 1943. Early life Friedman was born in Sochaczew (Sochatchov), Poland in 1899. His father, Aharon Yehoshua Friedman, was a poor shamash (synagogue caretaker); his mother supplemented the family income by selling wares in various fairs and markets.Avrohom, A. \\"Rabbi Alexander Zusha Friedman Hy\\"d: One of the few\\". Yated Ne'eman (Israel English Edition), 30 April 1999, pp. 14-16. Alexander Zusia, their only son, proved himself to be an illui (exceptional student) at a very young age. When he was 3, he knew the entire Book of Genesis by heart. When he was 9, his melamed informed his father that he had nothing left to teach him. His father then arranged for him to learn with a Talmudic scholar who had been brought from another town by three wealthy families to teach their gifted sons. The tuition was three rubles each per week, a huge sum in those days. When these families heard that Alexander Zusia would join their group, they offered to pay his father the three rubles for the privilege of having Alexander Zusia learn with and motivate their sons. But his father insisted on paying the tuition himself, which amounted to his entire week's wages. After his bar mitzvah, Alexander Zusia entered the Sochatchover yeshiva. In the summer of 1914 he became engaged to a girl from a nearby town. With the outbreak of World War I, he, his bride and his parents fled to Warsaw, where he studied under Rabbi Baruch Gelbart, a well-to-do Talmudic scholar who offered to support him, an offer which he refused. Friedman also attended lectures given by Rabbi Dr. Emanuel Carlebach for young Jewish refugees in Warsaw. Communal activist Postwar Poland was full of new reforms and political movements that caused many Jewish youth to rebel against traditional Torah observance. Friedman founded the Orthodox Federation to strengthen youth who were still loyal to the Torah camp. At the First Knessia Hagedola in 1923, he read aloud a statement in the name of Haredi youth pledging allegiance to the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. His organization, like other Orthodox ones, united under the banner of Zeirei Agudath Israel, the Agudah youth movement. Friedman subsequently rose in the ranks of the Agudah youth movement to become its leading figure and advisor. In 1925 Friedman was appointed secretary-general of Agudath Israel of Poland, a position he held until his death. He represented Agudath Israel in the Jewish Community Council of Warsaw, and was elected to the latter body three times, in 1926, 1930, and 1936. He was also the chairman of Keren HaTorah (the educational fund-raising arm of Agudath Israel), head of the Federation of Yesodei HaTorah Schools (the network of boys schools run by Agudath Israel), member of the National Executive of the Bais Yaakov movement in Poland, and director of the Bais Yaakov Teachers Seminary in Kraków. He was also a founder of the Seminary for Religious Teachers in Warsaw and lectured in this teacher-training institute. In addition to his other gifts, Friedman was a masterful orator and writer. His speeches combined deep knowledge of the Torah with original insights, and he was the second most popular speaker for the Agudath Israel of Poland, second only to Rabbi Meir Shapiro, the Rav of Lublin.Friedenson, Joseph. \\"Heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto\\" in Torah Lives: A treasury of biographical sketches, Rabbi Nisson Wolpin, ed. New York: Mesorah Publications, Ltd., 1995, pp. 110-112\\\\. . He wrote many articles for the religious press expounding the Torah point of view. In 1919 he founded and edited Digleinu (Our Banner), an Agudath Israel publication for young people. This paper was published between 1919 and 1924, and again between 1930 and 1931. From 1936 to 1938 he was a co- editor of Darkeinu (Our Path), the official journal of Agudath Israel of Poland. He also wrote poetry. Friedman visited Palestine in 1934 as part of a delegation led by World Agudath Israel activist Rabbi Yitzhak-Meir Levin. His sister, who had married Rabbi Avraham Mokatowski (known by his pen name, Eliyahu Kitov), immigrated to Palestine before World War II, as did his parents, but he opted to remain in Poland because of his communal responsibilities.Seidman, Dr. Hillel (1997). \\"Rabbi Alexander Zisha Friedman\\" in The Warsaw Ghetto Diaries, Targum Press, pp. 336-346\\\\. . Warsaw Ghetto Ruin of the Judenrat building in Warsaw On 20 November 1939 Friedman was arrested together with 21 other Polish Jewish leaders and jailed for one week to prevent them from resisting the construction of the Warsaw Ghetto. After his release he became the sole representative of Agudath Israel in the Warsaw Judenrat (Jewish Community Council), which advised the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee regarding the latter's relief efforts. At that time, religious Jews faced much discrimination from secular Jewish relief organizations. Friedman successfully pushed for the opening of the first kosher soup kitchen in Warsaw, which was followed by the opening of several other free kitchens operated by Agudath Israel workers. The Joint and the Judenrat entrusted him with hundreds of thousands of dollars in stipends to distribute to the hundreds of refugee families that arrived penniless in Warsaw, a task he fulfilled with humility and sensitivity. Friedman was one of the Torah leaders in the Warsaw Ghetto. He organized an underground network of religious schools, including \\"a Yesodei HaTorah school for boys, a Bais Yaakov school for girls, a school for elementary Jewish instruction, and three institutions for advanced Jewish studies\\". These schools, operating under the guise of kindergartens, medical centers and soup kitchens, were a place of refuge for thousands of children and teens, and hundreds of teachers. In 1941, when the Germans gave official permission to the Warsaw Judenrat to reopen Jewish schools, these schools came out of hiding and began receiving financial support from the official Jewish community. Though Judenrat president Adam Czerniaków often asked Friedman to become a member of the Judenrat, Friedman only agreed to organize the Judenrat's religious committee, which he staffed with representatives of all the religious political parties. On 22 July 1942 the Germans began mass deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto to the death camps. Among those deported were Friedman's wife and 13-year-old daughter, their only child, who had been born to them after 11 years of marriage. Friedman alerted world Jewry to the start of deportations in a coded message. His telegram read: \\"Mr. Amos kept his promise from the fifth-third.\\" He was referring to the Book of Amos, chapter 5, verse 3, which reads: \\"The city that goes out a thousand strong will have a hundred left, and the one that goes out a hundred strong will have ten left to the House of Israel\\". At a general political meeting in the Warsaw Ghetto on 25 July 1942, attended by members of the Joint, the Bund, General Zionists, Left-wing Zionists, communists, Jewish socialists, and members of Agudath Israel, Friedman was one of the only Jewish leaders who advised against armed resistance. He said, \\"God will not permit His people to be destroyed. We must wait and a miracle will certainly occur\\". Historians believe that this position grew out of Agudath Israel's belief that armed opposition would cause the Germans to liquidate the Ghetto. With the beginning of mass deportations, the Joint ceased its activities in the Ghetto and Friedman lost his financial support for his activities. With much effort, he procured a job as a shoemaker in the large Shultz factory, where he worked a 12-hour shift. Other Torah leaders who worked in the same factory were Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, the Piasetzener Rebbe; Rabbi Moshe Betzalel Alter, brother of the Gerrer Rebbe; Rabbi Avraham Alter, Rav of Pabianice; and Rabbi David Alberstadt, Rav of Sosnowiec. When the Joint resumed its operations clandestinely between October 1942 and January 1943, Friedman rejoined the organization to assist religious Jews. In March 1943 Friedman received a Paraguayan passport from Rabbi Chaim Yisroel Eiss, the Agudah rescue activist in Zurich, Switzerland, but he did not show it to the German authorities. Following the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April, Friedman was among those deported to the Trawniki concentration camp in the Lublin region. He was chosen for deportation to the death camps sometime after September 1943; his date of death is assumed to be November 1943, the same month the Trawinki camp was liquidated. Works His popular work, Der Torah Kval (1937), translated into Hebrew as Ma'ayanah shel Torah and into English as Wellsprings of Torah, combines insights from classic and Hasidic Torah commentators with Friedman's own chiddushim (novel Torah ideas) on the weekly Torah portion and Haftarah. Friedman wrote this work in Yiddish rather than Hebrew, and in a lighter, easy-to-understand style of short teachings, to appeal to the many Jews who were no longer versed in the difficult language and concepts of Hebrew sefarim. This work continues to be popular today and is frequently cited by Torah writers. Other published works include Kesef Mezukak (Refined Silver) (1923), a book of chiddushim on the principles of Talmudic study, and Kriah LeIsha Yehudit (Readings for the Jewish Woman) (1921). Friedman also published several textbooks for religious schools, including Iddish Lashon (Yiddish Language), a Yiddish primer. He wrote many other pamphlets and collections of chiddushim - including a collection on the Talmudic tractates of Gittin, Kiddushin, and Yoma that he titled Avnei Ezel (Guiding Stones) - which were lost in the war.

Hatfield Memorial Trail is a proposed long-distance trail through the Columbia River Gorge in Multnomah County and Hood River County, Oregon. The trail will be approximately 60 miles (96.6 kilometers), although the trail is still unofficial and its exact course is yet to be determined. The trail was first proposed by Tom Kloster on June 20, 2010 and suggests the Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail use existing trails from Multnomah Falls to Starvation Creek. Prior to this suggestion, the Talapus Trail, connecting the Pacific Crest Trail and Larch Mountain was slated for construction in 1974. Hikers openly used trails in the Bull Run into the 1980s, including the Talapus Trail (never officially constructed). Sights  The Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail features several waterfalls, forested land, mountains and valleys. Views from the trail include larger volcanoes in the Cascade Range including Mount Hood, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Rainier. The trail runs along the southern valleys and peaks on the Oregon side of the Columbia River. At times the river is visible during travel on the trail. Common vegetation seen on the trail includes Douglas-fir, western hemlock, vine maple, and large cedar tree. The trail is in old-growth for only short sections, as logging and the Yacolt Burn of 1902 destroyed much of the forest. The Bull Run problem Because the United States Forest Service has not made the Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail an official trail yet, and because some proponents of the trail would rather see it run past some remote landmarks such as Mt. Talapus, Eagle Butte, and Table Mountain, the exact course of the trail is still undetermined. All of these landmarks lie within the Bull Run Watershed, which is closed to the public under Public Law 95-200 (PL 95-200 or Bull Run Act). An alternate route, which avoids the Bull Run Watershed boundary, is currently used by hikers, although they do not have the opportunity to see some of the aforementioned places deep in the Columbia River Gorge when hiking this route. Some hiking is legal in the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit, \\"including 8.3 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, 1.3 miles of the Huckleberry Trail, and 1.4 miles of the Oneonta Creek Trail,\\" according to Oregon Health Authority's report on drinking water from 2011. This includes some usage by pack animals. The Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail would share some of the Pacific Crest Trail through the Bull Run Watershed and use some decommissioned roads (both in and out of the watershed). As of July 16, 2012, The Bull Run Watershed Management Unit, the Forest Service, nor the Portland Water Bureau have allowed for hikers to use any of the sections of the Bull Run Watershed, holding up an official version of the trail. On August 1, 2012 the Oregonian newspaper reported that the Portland Police Bureau were loaning FLIR surveillance equipment to the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office for the purpose of detecting people in the Bull Run Watershed. Portland City Council would need to vote on the issue of allowing additional hiking trails to be used in the watershed, but no vote is on the docket so far. Trail name and signage Proposed trail signThe Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail has some controversy around its name. The name comes from former Senator Mark Hatfield, a key figure in conserving the wilderness through which the proposed trail runs. Some feel the name of the trail should not reflect the name of a politician or have issues with Mark O. Hatfield's legacy. Another issue up for debate is what the signage will look like on the Mark O. Hatfield Memorial Trail. The trail has no signs at all and hikers and backpackers must follow signs for over 15 trails and roads in order to hike the trail in its entirety.

He was selected for the British team in the men's 50 km walk at the 2012 Summer Olympics, having previously competed for England in the 2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. Career King originally took up racewalking after being encouraged by his athletics club's coach. He competed in the 2002 Commonwealth Games at the age of 19, but was disqualified during the fifth lap after being in fourth place. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games, he finished in seventh place. King took a four-year break from international competition prior to competing at a 2012 World Cup event in Saransk, Russia, where he finished in 51st place with his second-fastest time ever. At the Dudinska 50 km in Dudince, Slovakia, he set a new personal best of four hours, six minutes 34 seconds, eight minutes faster than his previous best. This placed him within the Olympic \\"B\\" qualifying time for the 2012 Summer Olympics of 4 hours and 9 minutes. King suffered from a sleepless night after selectors did not let him know of his inclusion in the British team for the Games prior to the public announcement. The selectors had previously informed him that he would find out the day before the announcement. He was named as a member of the British squad, after being the only British athlete to achieve the qualifying time in the men's 50 km walk. King is the first competitor in the event for Great Britain since Chris Maddocks who competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Prior to the Olympics, he underwent altitude training with other members of the British squad in the Pyrenees. In the walk, he finished 51st, posting the time of 4:15.05. On the final lap, he gave hi-fives to members of the supportive home-crowd and games makers. His was the last ranked result of all participants of the walk. Just one month after the 2012 Olympic Games, Dominic won the National Long Distance Walking Championships, completing 100 miles in 18 hours, 13 minutes and 9 seconds, and becoming centurion number C1098. In 2019, he competed in the men's 50 kilometres walk at the 2019 World Athletics Championships held in Doha, Qatar. He was disqualified after a fourth red card. Personal life King lives in Colchester, and races for the Colchester Harriers club. He works at the University of Essex. He has a twin brother named Daniel, who is also a racewalker, and Dominic's training partner. Daniel raced against Dominic at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and finished higher than his twin, in 5th position.

Hammond was a right-handed batsman, although his bowling style is unknown. He was born at Storrington, Sussex. Hammond made his first-class debut for Sussex against Kent in 1841 at the Royal New Ground, Brighton. He played first-class cricket for Sussex in a thirteen-year career, making a total of forty appearances, the last of which came against a United South of England Eleven in 1859. In his forty matches, he scored a total of 932 runs at an average of 13.91, with a high score of 92. One of three half centuries he made, this score came against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 1843, an innings which helped secure Sussex a draw. His early appearances for the county were met with success, however, according to Scores and Biographies, \\"After 1849, however, he seldom was engaged in a match, owing to (at least the compiler was so informed) his being a bad field, but could throw in well at the distance of 70 or 80 yards.\\" The same publication noted of his batting that he \\"was a fine and powerful hitter\\". In addition to play first-class cricket for Sussex, he also appeared for a number of other teams in first- class cricket. In 1842, he played one match for the Slow Bowlers against the Fast Bowlers at Lord's, indicating that he was perhaps a slow bowler of some sort. In 1844, he appeared once for Petworth against the Marylebone Cricket Club, as well as once for the Married players against the Single players. The following season he appeared three times for Petworth, making two appearances against the Marylebone Cricket Club and one against Hampshire. In that same season he appeared once for the Players in the Gentlemen v Players fixture. He also made a single appearance for England against Kent in 1845, while in 1846 he played in a repeat of that same fixture. Besides playing cricket, he also stood as an umpire in four first-class matches from 1849 to 1864. He died at Rackham, Sussex, on 20 July 1901. His father, John Hammond, was a prominent first-class cricketer of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, while his nephew, Ernest Hammond, also played first-class cricket.

It performs the same function as a conventional unit injector in an internal combustion engine, such as in an on-road or off-road vehicle or a diesel-electric locomotive. The pressurized delivery of fuel is camshaft-driven, but the timing of the injector's internal operations are controlled by the engine control unit so as to achieve certain advantages. Advantages * Maximum horsepower, within the applicable emissions tier * Minimum emissions, possibly at the expense of slightly increased fuel consumption * Minimum fuel consumption, possibly at the expense of slightly increased emissions * Optimum vehicle performance Construction Central to the EUI is the built-in plunger pump, which, just as in a UI, allows for low- pressure fuel delivery and return to all injectors, yet provides exceptionally high pressure and concomitant injection and atomization of the fuel to a cylinder during the engine's power cycles. As in a UI, the injector is connected to common banks of fuel supply and fuel return. Fuel is always circulating within the EUI as two of its functions, other than injection for combustion, are injector lubrication and injector cooling. Connections on UIs are by formed steel tubes. Connections on EUIs are by stainless steel- reinforced hoses. The controlled part of the injector is a solenoid-operated spill valve. Normally, it is open, allowing the fuel to return to the supply line when the pump plunger descends. When the solenoid is energized, the spill valve closes, and the fuel is forced through the spray tip into the cylinder. The four phases of EUI operation are: ; Fill phase: As the pump plunger retracts, fuel is drawn into the pump chamber from the fuel supply line. ; Spill phase: The pump plunger begins descending, but the spill valve is open, and fuel recirculates back to the return line. ; Injection phase: Partway through the pump stroke, the solenoid is energized, which closes the spill valve. The fuel is forced into the cylinder through the spray tip. ; Pressure reduction phase: Toward the end of the pump stroke, the spill valve is re- opened, allowing the fuel to recirculate again and ending the injection phase. Thus, although the mechanical plunger pump has a fixed stroke, electronic control can select any part of that stroke to deliver to the cylinder, thereby controlling the volume and timing of fuel delivery. Users This system is employed primarily on Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) locomotive, marine and stationary engines, and primarily on the 710 family of diesel engines. Locomotive use When implemented in a locomotive, the ECU may also be incorporated into the Locomotive Control Unit (LCU), which performs a variety of functions, such as wheel-slip control, \\"phone home\\" for incident reporting and scheduling of delivery of service parts, etc. EMD's LCU is often GPS- assisted, and maintenance personnel can effectively monitor the performance of perhaps thousands of locomotives at all times. EMD has released updated LCU software, and EIUs which complement that software, which allows mixing Tier-1 and Tier-0 injectors within the same engine, and yet meets the applicable emissions tier for that engine. A specific benefit is reduced inventory of injectors. A significant feature of the new EUIs is reduced \\"smoke\\". Also improved fuel economy. Indeed, the new \\"Tier 1/Tier 0\\" injectorsEMD Part Number 40112933 (new); 40112941 (remanufactured) are also applicable to locomotives which are not certified to any Tier, and the same \\"smoke\\" reduction and fuel economy benefits apply thereto.

The Berrangés were essentially a family of Dutch Reformed ministers, but there were also \\"sick-comforters,\\" medical doctors, public servants, politicians and advocates. His mother was Elizabeth Theresa Krogh. Berrangé's maternal grandfather, Johannes C. Krogh of Danish extraction, was Special Commissioner sent from the South African Republic to Swaziland (1894 to 1898), head of the Boundary Commission that settled the border between Swaziland and Moçambique (Maputo) in 1897 and one of the Boer signatories to the \\"Treaty of the Peace of Vereeniging\\". Family Berrangé married (7 March 1930) Yolande Viviane Brewer, née de Pierres (born 1900), who loved and supported him in all ways for 50 years until her death (1980). They had one son, Jevan Pierres Berrangé (b. 1931, d. 2018); a daughter Gelda Frances Berrangé (b.8 February 1927, d. 2015), and a son Eric Brewer (b. 15 June 1921, d. 30 March 2010) from their respective earlier marriages. Education Berrangé was born in Pretoria soon after it had been occupied by the British during the Anglo-Boer War. He received his primary education at the Falk Real Gymnasium in Berlin (1907–1910) and at the German School in Johannesburg (1911). His secondary school was Hilton College, Natal, where he is commemorated on a plaque as \\"Scholar of the Year'\\". On leaving school (1917) he enlisted as one of Major Miller's recruits and became a Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, being trained in Kent, UK. After demobilisation (1919) he returned to South Africa and worked briefly for the Institute for Medical Research before going to the University of Cape Town from which he graduated (1924) with a law degree – BA LLB Recreation and other interests Berrangé was an immaculate dresser and had a penchant for high living and fast cars. He was always against authority, loved a challenge and revelled in danger. He was a very active man, both intellectually and physically. Sports at school, in the RAF and at university included boxing, rowing, rugby and swimming. Later he became a motor racing driver (1932) on South African circuits. He had a large collection of sporting firearms and was keen on big game hunting and bird shooting. His considerable knowledge of guns and ballistics was something that he found useful in some of his criminal cases. In the 1930s he had an interest in a small gold mine in Swaziland. He read avidly and travelled widely in Africa and Europe. Communist Berrangé joined the South African Communist Party of his own volition in about 1938, holding the opinion that it was an organisation which expressed in practice those economic and social theories which appealed to him. Berrangé was an ordinary member attached to the Central Branch in Johannesburg, except for a period when he was on a committee dealing with Industrial Legislation and Trade Union Work. Berrangé resigned from the SACP in 1950 when and because it was dissolved, after the passing of the Suppression of Communism Act 1950. Berrangé later reappraised and radically changed his views, to become critical of the theories and practices of the party. Despite this change of views he remained friends with some former comrades and subsequently was a member of the team defending Bram Fischer in court. Legal career Berrangé was admitted to the South African Bar in 1924 but in 1926 he left the Bar and went into partnership with his father, James Louis Steyn Berrangé (born 16 October 1865,died 1931), as an attorney. He remained at the Side Bar until 1950 when he was re-admitted to the Bar where he remained until his retirement in 1966. Berrangé built up a reputation as an outstanding criminal defence and human rights lawyer with a reputation for devastating cross-examination. He was a co-founder of The Organisation for Rights and Justice and Chairman of the Legal Aid Society. As such he was often willing to accept briefs in cases where non-whites were charged under the discriminatory apartheid laws, and in such cases usually acted pro bono. =Special wartime duties= In 1941 Berrangé was charged with special duties by Brigadier General Collyer, Military Secretary to General Smuts. These duties included seeking out fascists who might be infiltrating the armed forces. After the Second World War, however, Berrangé would find himself increasingly involved in defending the human rights of those prosecuted by the Nationalist Government some of whose members had been supporters of the Nazis. =Alexandra bus boycott= Following the Alexandra Township bus boycott (1944), organised in response to the bus companies raising bus fares by a penny, the Government passed emergency legislation that prohibited all meetings. Communists Bram Fischer and Berrangé discovered a legal loophole in this legislation which meant that the boycotters could still assemble and march. However, when discussing this loophole over the phone, their lines were tapped by the police who thereby learned of it and hastily redrafted the legislation. The boycotters won their concessions in the end. This was the first of many times that Berrangé and Fischer worked together for justice for the oppressed. =African mine workers' strike= In 1946, whilst he was on holiday in Europe, Berrangé received a phone call from Bram Fischer asking him to return to South Africa to defend him and others on a charge of inciting the African Mine Workers' Strike. This was strongly supported by the SACP. Some 70,000 African miners took part in this momentous strike which lasted five days before it was violently put down by the police at the cost of eleven miners killed and more than 1,200 injured. The 52 defendants pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a strike, but they received relatively modest sentences = The F.M. Alexander case = Together with others including Harold Hanson and Bram Fischer, Berrangé acted for F. M. Alexander in the high profile Alexander Libel Trial which caused an international stir. Berrangé was initially introduced to the Alexander Technique by his wife, Yolande. In the 1940s all close family members were having \\"Alexander lessons\\" from Irene Tasker who had been taught by Alexander in New York and London, and his son Jevan was attending Tasker's Montessori school. When Dr Ernst Jokl, Director of Physical Education to the South African Government and apparently hostile to the Alexander Technique, asked Tasker to demonstrate the Technique, she arranged for Berrangé to be present as a legal witness. Upon reading Jokl's subsequent article in the SA Government journal 'Volkskragte', Berrangé was of the opinion that it was libellous and suggested that Tasker show it to Alexander, whom subsequently started libel proceedings. As instructing attorney for Alexander, Berrangé journeyed to London in 1946 to help prepare the case with his client and English Counsel. He became friendly with Alexander, who joined Berrangé and his wife Yolande and the Barlows (Bill and Marjory, Alexander Technique teachers) on a short holiday to France. The trial proper was heard in South Africa in 1948. Alexander won his case and was awarded damages. =The Treason Trial= The circumstances which led to the South African Treason Trial, the proceedings, and the conclusion some ten years later, all demonstrated Berrangé's personal qualities and professional skill. In 1951 when the leaders of the Congress Movement developed a plan involving deliberate defiance of the apartheid laws, Berrangé was consulted on its legal implications. After the Defiance Campaign during which some 8,000 volunteers went to prison; in 1955 the Congress of the People organised a convention, attended by thousands of delegates, to present the Freedom Charter that was essentially a call for a democratic South Africa in which \\"all shall enjoy equal human rights\\". The Nationalist Government's reaction to this was to arrest 156 people and charge them with high treason, a crime punishable by the death penalty. The accused represented a cross-section of South Africans from all walks of life and included Oliver Tambo, Chief Albert Luthuli (winner of the Nobel Peace Prize), Helen Joseph and Nelson Mandela. The formidable defence team included Berrangé who, in a stirring opening address at the preliminary hearing, contended, inter alia, that the ideas and beliefs expressed in the Freedom Charter, although opposed to the policy of the Government, were shared by the overwhelming majority of humankind, of all races and all colours, and also the overwhelming majority of the country's citizens. He argued that the treason allegations amounted to a political plot comparable with the Inquisition and the Reichstag Fire Trial, and were an attempt to silence and outlaw the ideas held by the accused and the thousands whom they represented. This vibrant address was published in newspapers around the world. The State alleged that holding the Congress of the People and adopting the Freedom Charter constituted steps towards the establishment of a communist state and the prelude to revolution. They aimed to show that speeches and writings by the accused were communistic. Probably the most farcical event in the trial occurred when expert witness for the prosecution, Prof. A.H. Murray of the University of Cape Town, gave evidence on the nature of communism and the infallible clues that he claimed indicated certain statements and speeches were communistic or communist inspired. Berrangé's cross-examination was dramatic. He read out a number of statements by various people and the professor agreed that these were \\"the sort of statements that communists make\\". Berrangé then revealed that the statements had been made by persons such as former SA Prime Minister Malan, President Franklin Roosevelt, William Pitt, Heine, Luther, Voltaire, Milton and Jefferson and finally one written by Prof Murray himself in the 1930s! The accused had been arrested in December 1956, but it was only in March 1961, after numerous hearings, that by unanimous verdict the Court found all the accused not guilty and Berrangé was carried aloft outside the court. =Move to Swaziland and retirement= In 1959 Berrangé left Johannesburg to live in Swaziland, where he acquired Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies thereby forfeiting his South African citizenship and passport. He continued to practise law intermittently, both in the Republic of South Africa and Swaziland, until his full retirement in 1966 and resignation from the Johannesburg Bar. The proceedings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission show that South African Government continued to keep Berrange under close surveillance whenever he visited the country. He was briefly on a committee whose purpose was to afford assistance to political refugees from South Africa. In 1963, at the time of the Rivonia arrests, two suspects, Harold Wolpe and Arthur Goldreich, made a spectacular jail break from the Johannesburg Fort and eventually managed to get to Swaziland where Berrangé helped by arranging a charter plane to fly them to Bechuanaland (Botswana) Berrangé died in Swaziland in 1983 at Siteki, Lubombo. =The Rivonia Trial= The Rivonia Trial was the outcome of a raid on Liliesleaf Farm at Rivonia near Johannesburg on 11 July 1963, when police arrested seven alleged members of the armed wing of the African National Congress, seizing many highly incrimating documents of their activities and plans. The accused included Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Raymond Mhlaba, Rusty Bernstein and Nelson Mandela, who had been arrested later upon release from jail. The charge was sabotage and the death sentence seemed likely. The defence team was led by Bram Fischer and included Berrangé, whom he asked to come from Swaziland. He accepted unhesitatingly despite risking ex- communication from the legal profession as he knew that the government was drafting legislation which would permit them to debar any \\"named\\" communist from practising law in South Africa. Berrangé had special responsibility for the defence of Bernstein, Mhlaba and Kathrada. Once again, his devastating cross-examination exposed inconsistencies and outright lies in the testimony of many of the state witnesses. With the exception of Bernstein, all the accused were found guilty and sentenced to lengthy jail terms (from 22 to 27 years) but avoided the death penalty. =Looksmart Ngudle inquest= As part of a crack-down following the Rivonia raid, in mid-August 1963 the police arrested Looksmart Khulile Ngudle, a regional leader of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Sixteen days later he was found hanged in his cell. Despite the police's best attempts at suppression of the cause of his death they were eventually forced to hold an inquest. Berrangé represented Ngudle's widow and decided to turn the inquest into a forum on police torture. When the Court deemed evidence of torture to other detainees as inadmissible Berrangé withdrew from the proceedings in protest. The matter was subsequently raised in Parliament by Helen Suzman to the great embarrassment of the Government. =Trial of Rusty Bernstein= Shortly after his acquittal in the Rivonia Trial, Rusty Bernstein was arrested again on three charges under the Suppression of Communism Act. Berrangé again Rusty and his wife Hilda were thus able to flee to the UK via Botswana. =The Fischer Trial= Berrangé's last political trial was defending his friend and colleague Bram Fischer, who along with 14 others had been charged in 1964 under the Suppression of Communism Act. In the event Fischer realised the futility of his case and whilst the trial was in progress skipped bail and went underground to continue the struggle against apartheid. He was recaptured nine months later in November 1965, put on trial for a second time, found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. Award In 2010 Berrangé was posthumously awarded The Order of the Companions of O.R.

Population: Geography Gazimursky Zavod (labelled as Gazimurskiy Zavod) (1951) Gazimursky Zavod stands on the right bank of the Gazimur River, which is a left tributary of the Argun. Its location in the Gazimur River basin is between the mountains of southeastern Transbaikal, about southeast of Chita.Энциклопедия Забайкалья. Entry on Gazimursky Zavod To the northwest rise the Borshchovochnye Mountains, about high; to the southeast are the Uryumkan Mountains with the peak Vershina Baydonki (); to the northeast are the Gazimur Mountains with Ushmunsky Golets (). History In 1773, silver and lead were found close to the village of Tayna. A small smelter was built in 1774–1778 and a settlement grew around it. In 1779, it became a seat of a volost. Destroyed by high waters, it was rebuilt and extended in 1789–1790. Their leader Yegor Barbot de Marny (1743–1796) even planned to transfer the management of all Southeast Transbaikalia's extensive mining region here from Nerchinsky Zavod, where the ore was exhausted. Since the expectations at Gazimursky Zavod were also not fulfilled, the plan did not succeed. The plant was expanded yet again in 1832—in 1834 there were 330 workers, including many exiles. However, in 1846 the smelter was closed. In 1837, there were 141 households in Gazimursky Zavod, but by 1860 their number declined to 109. In 1851, the first staff of the First Infantry Brigade of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks troops was in Gazimursky Zavod. A hospital was established, which was open also for the civilian population. From 1872 to 1918, the Third Infantry division was stationed there. On January 4, 1926, Gazimursky Zavod became the administrative center of its eponymous district. In 1934, a Machine and Tractor Station was established in the selo. In 1961, thirteen kolkhozes in the raion were consolidated into two sovkhozes. The administration of one of the sovkhozes was in Gazimursky Zavod. Economy Today Gazimursky Zavod is mainly a center of agriculture and forestry. It also houses most utilities of the district. =Transportation= Gazimursky Zavod is on the regional road R429 which connects it to Sretensk to the northwest. Sretensk is also the nearest railway station, the terminus of a branch line of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The R429 leads southeast to Nerchinsky Zavod, away, and on to Olochi, a village on the Argun River, navigable from there, and on the border with China. Another road from Gazimursky Zavod leads to villages downstream the Gazimur River. Since the 1970s, there was an air connection to Chita, but it came to a halt in the 1990s. The small airfield was closed in 2001. In 2007, Norilsk Nickel and the Russian Railways signed an agreement to build a railway Naryn–Lugokan, branching the Krasnokamensk railway, primarily focused on the transportation of significant molybdenum, antimony, copper, gold, and other ore deposits in the region.

He died in Paris on January 5, 1960. He was the son of the painter Allan Österlind and the father of watercolorist Nanic Osterlind. During his youth, Osterlind was close to the impressionist movement, through Armand Guillaume and the aging Auguste Renoir, whom he assisted. He was close to the Fauvism artists at their peak. He also developed mutual friendship and esteem with a number of prominent painters of the School of Paris, such as Amedeo Modigliani, Michel Kikoine, Chaim Soutine, Othon Friesz, Jacques Villon, André Dunoyer de Segonzac. However, Osterlind showed a fierce sense of independence, an extreme sensitivity to nature, and a dedication to pictural mastery. He pursued, over fifty years, and in a total indifference to trends, a landscape artist's work, original and filled with strong poetic intensity. Life =Youth 1887-1907= Through this period, Anders Osterlind stayed with his parents in Paris, Brittany (Bréhat, Penvern), or the Creuse area (Gargilesse). Whilst in Brittany, amongst his parents' friends, he met with the philosopher Ernest Renan, the art critics Armand Dayot and Charles Le Goffic, the poets Edmond Haraucourt and Max Jacob, the painter Maxime Maufra and in the Creuse area, the poet Maurice Rollinat. In Paris, he got acquainted with the large group of Scandinavian artists living in the capital at the end of the 19th century, in particular August Strindberg, Prince Eugen of Sweden, and the painter Per Ekström. When he was 5 years old, he also met Auguste Renoir, who was living next to his parents at the bottom of Montmartre hill, and who used to take him for long walks in the Luxembourg gardens. Later in his life, he found back the famous painter in Cagnes in 1918-1919. He received his primary education along the places of the family's moves, in schools at Penvern, and Bréhat, in Brittany, then in Gargilesse-Dampierre and Fresselines in the Creuse area. His secondary education was completed in Sainte-Croix school in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. He did not attend any art school or studio. His artistic education was provided by his father, the painter-etcher- watercolorist :sv:Allan Österlind, of post romantic and naturalist inclination, and by his French friends Maurice Rollinat, Maxime Maufra, Jean- François Raffaëlli, as well as by the Nordic community he used to get with, and in particular the swede Per Ekström who taught him the art of painting knife which shall become a feature of his work. In 1905, at the SNBA Paint Fair, Anders Osterlind hung a pastel \\"L'Aurore\\" (The Dawn) and an oil painting \\"Effet de neige\\" (Snow effect), his first painting which he presented to his master Per Ekström as a gesture of recognition. =The maturity (1907-1960)= From 1907 onwards, he started selling his work, in particular in Sweden. He moved around in the Montparnasse group, and from 1918-1919, he associated himself with the artist group which was to form the Ecole de Paris : among his friends were Michel Kikoine, Amedeo Modigliani, etc. Anders Osterlind is primarily a landscape artist. In search of light, emotion, he went to numerous places around France. He also stayed abroad. He got inspired by the Paris area (Versailles, Moret-sur-Loing, Rambouillet forest), Northern Brittany (Penvern, Ploumanac'h, Tonquédec, Bréhat, Lannion, Saint-Quay-Portrieux), Finistère (Bénodet, Portsall), Normandy (Honfleur, Barfleur, Yport, Martagny, etc.), South of France (Arles, Cagnes-sur-Mer, Aix-en-Provence, Vaison-la-Romaine), and also by the Creuse, Corrèze, Sarthe, Touraine, Alps, Lozère (Florac), Cantal (Thiézac), Charente, Pays Basque. He also stayed in Tunisia, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. Osterlind was a member of the \\"Salon d'Automne\\" (the well established Fall exhibition), the Salon des Indépendants, of the board of the \\"Salon des Tuileries\\", vice-president of the \\"Salon du dessin et de la peinture à l'eau\\". He has left over 2000 paintings, held in private collections and in numerous museums in France and abroad. His paintings =1907-1926= Getting away, under the influence of the Fauves and cubist artists, from the impressionists and realist trends of the artistic group around of his father, Osterlind asserted, as from his first entry to the Salon of SNBA (Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts), a solid taste for a rich paste, expressing a lyrism which developed over time : paintings of Neuilly-sur- Seine, Colombes, Brittany, Cagnes-sur-Mer. His palette simplified: ochre, fauve and green shades prevail in the Versailles and Creuse areas and the Orne forests landscapes. The artist reached his plain maturity. The critics then set him at the level of Maurice de Vlaminck, whom he is no follower of, but, was like him, drawn to develop a personal and quite original work. =The maturity 1926-1940= From 1926, playing audaciously with blacks and whites, Osterlind provided landscapes with silvery lakes and rivers, under large grey skies, which years the critics referred to as the \\"grey period\\". The landscapes of Lozère, Charente and Somme then set out all the shades of green, to the surprise of those critics, who characterized these years as the \\"green period\\". =The shock of the war 1940-1948= The defeat of France, the death of his son and the surge of the new painting deeply moved the artist, whose work then took a tragic flavour : snow landscapes in Cantal, paintings of the Paris area and Brittany spattered with chrome yellow, ultramarine, carmine, dark descent from the cross under reddish skies, tormented standstills, which disconcerted the lovers of his paintings in the grey and green periods with their soft and strange poetry. =Back to peaceful times 1948-1960= He stayed in Brittany, and spent summers in Vexin, and also more in particular in the sunny peace of the countryside near Aix-en-Provence, which he painted with Cézanne in mind. This artist was the only reference whom he acknowledged next to his father, Per Ekström and the Creuse area of his youth. His work ended by large paintings in which warm and cold tones combine in flower bunches with deep substance and landscapes radiant with an appeased inner life. =1960= His death shall be, for artists like Marc Chagall and critics such as René Huyghe, from the Académie française, that of a great artist in his time.

Curtiss's milkweed belongs to the subfamily Asclepiadoideae and the genus Asclepias. This dicotyledonous, perennial plant was placed on the endangered species list by the state of Florida to protect this rare milkweed. Although Curtiss milkweed is found all over Florida, the populations are very isolated and concentrated. Description Curtiss's milkweed is a deciduous plant that can become very tall and lanky, reaching up to 2–4 feet tall. The leaves of Asclepias curtissii are large, elliptical, and dark green in color and usually have a noticeable undulating edge. The flower of this plant bloom in the summer months. The flower heads (umbels) of this plant are few and are usually located on the ends of the main stalks and consist of about 20–30 individual flowers, which are a bright white when they bloom. Ecology The sap of Asclepias curtissii contains cardenolides which are toxic to vertebrates in high quantities. Despite this deer are the main consumers of Curtiss's milkweed, followed up by grasshoppers removing some flowers. Many insect larvae use Curtiss's milkweed as a shelter for the early part of their lives, as well as providing food for these larvae. Although Asclepias curtissii isn't usually associated with monarch butterflies as a food source, monarchs can feed off of it and will if the need arises. Habitat Curtiss's milkweed lives in the excessively drained parts of Florida. Asclepias curtissii is usually found with other plants including Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), Chapman oak (Quercus chapmanii), myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia), and sand live oak (Quercus geminata), amongst other plants. Curtiss's milkweed has a very high tolerance for soil disturbance, often being found along the edges of fire lanes and sand roads. Reproduction The spread out population of this milkweed proposes a problem, mainly pollination, but Curtiss's milkweed has specialized flowers that only allow certain insects – that seek out this plant – to pollinate it. These insects include skipper butterflies and hairstreaks, which were found in abundance on the flowers of Asclepias curtissii.

From their principal totem they were frequently called the Wolf tribe of the Lenape. They were considered the most warlike portion of their nation and assumed the leadership in war councils. They were prominent in the early history of New York and New Jersey, being among the first nations of that region to meet the European settlers. Background The Munsee originally occupied the headwaters of the Delaware River in present-day New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, extending south to the Lehigh River, and also held the west bank of the Hudson River from the Catskill mountains nearly to the New Jersey line. They were bordered by the Mahican and Wappinger on the north and east, and the Lenape (Delaware) on the south and southeast. They were regarded as a buffer between the southern Lenape and the Iroquois Confederacy based in present-day New York south of the Great Lakes. Their council village was Minisink, probably in Sussex County, New Jersey. The bands along the Hudson were prominent in the early history of New York, but as European-American settlements increased, most of the Munsee moved south to join their relatives along the Delaware.Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico, Vol.3, Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology, 1912 History In 1669 they aided the Esopus tribe in attacking the Dutch colonists, and were defeated by Martin Cregier (see Esopus Wars). By a noted fraudulent treaty known as the Walking Purchase, the main body of the Munsee was forced to move from the Delaware River about the year 1740. They settled on the Susquehanna River, on lands assigned them by the Iroquois - (Ong we Oweh - \\"The only true men\\"). Soon afterward they moved westward, joining the main Lenape nation on the Ohio River. Most became incorporated with that group. In 1756 those remaining in New York were placed upon lands in Schoharie County and were incorporated with the Mohawk. A considerable body, the Christian Munsee, who were converted by the Moravian missionaries, drew off from the rest and formed a separate organization, most of them moving to Canada during the American Revolution. Others joined Ojibwa and Stockbridge people in Wisconsin. The majority were incorporated in the Lenape, with whom they participated in their subsequent wars and removals. Those who kept the name of Munsee were in three bands in the early 20th century, in Canada and the United States. Two had consolidated with remnants of other nations, so that no separate census is available. These nations were the Munsee of the Thames, Ontario, Canada, 120 (now recognized as a First Nation known as the Delaware Nation at Moraviantown; Chippewa and Munsee Franklin County, Kansas, 90 , they had a federal reservation together from 1859 but dissolved their tribal relations in 1900); and Stockbridge and Munsee, Green Bay Agency, Wisconsin, 530.

After the war, Beale spent several years training Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) pilots on Republic F-84 Thunderjets. He married Sung Ching, the sister of a ROCAF fighter group commander, adopted her daughter and settled in Taiwan. AUREV service Beale left the air force and joined Civil Air Transport, a CIA front organisation based in Taiwan. CAT valued Beale for his connections with the ROCAF hierarchy. In April 1958, CAT sent Beale to Clark Air Base in the Philippines, where he was assigned a Douglas B-26 Invader that had been painted black and had its markings obscured. On April 19, 1958 Beale flew the bomber to Mapanget, a rebel-held Indonesian Air Force base on the Minahassa Peninsula of northern Sulawesi. The rebels were Permesta, led by dissident local army officers opposed to the government of President Sukarno. Beale and his B-26 formed part of the CIA element in Permesta's Angkatan Udara Revolusioner (\\"Revolutionary Air Force\\") or AUREV. Beale flew his first AUREV mission on April 20, attacked Palu, the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, with four bombs followed by machine-gun fire. On April 21 he made a similar attack on the Indonesian Air Force base on the island of Morotai, damaging the runway and setting a line of fuel drums on fire. In the next few days Beale flew two more sorties attacking Palu. Very early on April 27 one of Beale's CAT colleagues, Allen Pope, brought a second CIA B-26 from Clark to Mapanget. Later that morning Pope flew to attack Morotai ahead of a Permesta amphibious assault while Beale flew to Ambon Island further south. Beale attacked Ambon City, the provincial capital, setting on fire a military command post, a fuel depot and a Royal Dutch Shell complex. On April 28, 1958, Beale bombed and sank the Indonesian Navy corvette KRI Hang Tuah, killing 18 crew and wounding another 28. This photo shows Hang Tuah in her original guise as the RAN Bathurst class corvette . The CIA instructed CAT pilots to target commercial shipping in order to drive foreign merchant ships away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and undermining Sukarno's government. On the morning of April 28 Beale attacked Balikpapan on the south coast of East Kalimantan province in Borneo. He first hit the airfield with a bomb in the middle of the runway, and then turned to attack the Royal Dutch Shell oil terminal in Balikpapan harbor. He bombed, set ablaze and sank the British 12,278 ton oil tanker , that belonged to Eagle Oil and Shipping, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. He then aimed a bomb at a second British tanker, the 8,139 ton , that belonged to another Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, Anglo-Saxon Petroleum. However, the bomb bounced off one of Daronias ventilators amidships without detonating and landed harmlessly in the sea. Beale then machine-gunned and destroyed Royal Dutch Shell's oil pipes to its wharf. With the last of his 500 lb bombs, Beale turned seaward and sank an Indonesian Navy Bathurst class corvette, KRI Hang Tuah, killing 18 crew and seriously wounding another 28. The CIA's plan to intimidate foreign trade quickly scored its first success. Royal Dutch Shell suspended its tanker service to Balikpapan and evacuated shore-based wives and families to Singapore. After his raid on Balikpapan, Beale returned to Mapanget and re-armed. On the afternoon of the same day he attacked Ambon City, hitting and slightly damaging the Indonesian Army barracks next to the marketplace. On April 30, Beale returned to Ambon and bombed the airstrip again. On May 1, Beale and his B-26 returned to Clark Air Base for a rest. Early on May 9, Beale returned to Mapanget, releasing Pope who then took his turn to go on leave. Later that same morning, Beale attacked Ambon again. Ambon now had several machine guns with which it gave anti- aircraft fire. An Indonesian Air Force North American P-51 Mustang chased Beale's B-26 but failed to catch it. On May 10, Beale with his B-26, plus two Philippine Air Force pilots flying AUREV P-51 fighters, attacked Amahai airfield on the island of Seram, destroying an Indonesian Air Force P-51 on the ground. On May 12–13 Beale and the two Filipinos flew two sorties over Central Sulawesi, inflicting heavy damage. On the afternoon of May 13 Beale and his B-26 attacked Ambon again, this time accompanied by an AUREV Consolidated PBY Catalina flown by CIA agent Connie W Seigrist. Off Ambon, Beale strafed and holed a large sailing vessel, which then settled atop a coral reef. Beale tired of both the heavy flying schedule and personality clashes at Mapanget air base. By May 15 he had quit the operation, leaving Pope as the sole B-26 bomber pilot. The operation did not last much longer. On May 18, Pope attacked an amphibious landing force that was steaming from Ambon to re-take the islands of Morotai and Halmahera. Pope was shot down and captured, exposing the USA's sponsorship of the Permesta rebellion.Time, June 9, 1958 Embarrassed, the Eisenhower administration terminated CIA support for Permesta and withdrew its agents and remaining aircraft from AUREV. Covert operations in Laos After the USA aborted its CIA attack on Indonesia, Beale remained in CAT service. In 1959 the CIA airline became Air America, and by 1962 Beale was flying covert missions in support of US covert operations in Laos. On April 2, 1962, Beale was in a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver trying to take off from an airstrip in northeastern Laos. The DHC-2 was overloaded, failed to become airborne and crashed at the end of the runway, killing all on board. He died from severe burns over 100 percent of his body.

The coup came in response to Hobeika's signing of the Syrian-sponsored Tripartite Accord that aimed to put an end to the Lebanese Civil War. Background The tussle between Samir Geagea and Elie Hobeika for control over the Lebanese Forces (LF) had started as early as March 1985. That same month, Samir Geagea gained control over the LF after defeating the last leader of the Phalangist militia, Fouad Abou Nader. In May of that same year, however, Elie Hobeika was appointed to lead that unit. In December 1985, Hobeika signed in the name of the LF an agreement with the Syrian government, the Druze Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) led by Walid Jumblatt, and the Shia Muslim Amal Movement headed by Nabih Berri, which became known as the Tripartite Accord. One of the cornerstones of the agreement was the disbandment of Lebanese militia forces. It also provided for initiating political changes that would end Christian dominance of the Lebanese parliament and army. There was a dispute over whether to retain links with Israel and how to react to Syrian-sponsored negotiations to end the fighting. Hobeika broke LF links with Israel and supported the negotiations between the LF, the Lebanese government, Syria, and Druze leaders such as Walid Jumblatt. Geagea opposed the negotiations which he claimed would make unacceptable concessions to Syria and weaken the Lebanese Christian community's political power. In October 1985, with negotiations in progress, skirmishes took place between Geagea's supporters and Hobeika's supporters, where hobeika's supporters tried to bribe geagea's supporter's to betray Geagea. In December 1985, a peace agreement, the Tripartite Accord, was reached. It was signed by Hobeika for the LF, but the LF Command Council was split, with only half agreeing with the deal. In addition, the agreement was criticized by the former President of Lebanon Camille Chamoun and leader of the predominately Christian Maronite National Liberal Party (NLP), and by some Maronite Church leaders because they felt that this agreement was one sided favoring the muslim communities in lebanon. The coup Samir Geagea and president Amine Gemayel decided not to accept the agreement, with Geagea's LF faction attacking Hobeika's LF Loyalists' positions in east Beirut on 8 January 1986, being backed by the Lebanese Army's 9th Brigade.Collelo, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 223.Barak, The Lebanese Army – A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 115. On 13 January, in a bid to greatly extend Hobeika's own power, his faction stepped up the conflict by assaulting the positions held by the Kataeb Party militia loyal to Amine Gemayel. The Kataeb party leader, Amine Gemayel, was at the time serving as president of Lebanon. The support of the Kataeb to the pro-Geagea LF faction during the conflict that ensued proved decisive in the defeat of Hobeika, resulting in his ousting from the command of the LF, which was subsequently taken over by the victorious Geagea. The defeated Hobeika escaped from east Beirut in a helicopter and made his way to the town of Zahle in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley, where he rallied his remaining supporters to form the dissident Lebanese Forces – Executive Command (LFEC) militia sponsored by Syria. Later, Geagea attacked the Kataeb that supported him and started a consolidation of power campaign which resulted in crippling the Kataeb.

Cozart's music first became popular during his teen years in the early 2010s among high school students from Chicago's South Side. In 2012, his popular local single \\"I Don't Like\\" was remixed by rapper Kanye West and reached the Billboard Rap Top 20, further raising Cozart's profile. A bidding war between major labels resulted in Keef signing with Interscope. His debut album Finally Rich was released in December 2012, and featured the singles \\"I Don't Like\\" and \\"Love Sosa\\", which would popularize the Chicago rap subgenre drill. Chief Keef has faced ongoing legal issues during his career, including weapons possession charges, house arrest sentences, and a performance ban imposed by Chicago authorities. Though he was dropped from Interscope in late 2014 and later signed to 1017 Records, he continued self-releasing projects through his own Glo Gang label. These included: Nobody (2014), Back from the Dead 2 (2014), Bang 3 (2015), and Thot Breaker (2017). In recent years, critics have pointed to Chief Keef as a major influence on contemporary hip hop through his innovation with the drill subgenre and the impact of his music on other artists. Life and career =Early life (1995–2010)= Chief Keef was born Keith Farrelle Cozart in Chicago, Illinois, to Lolita Carter who was 16 and unwed. He is named after his deceased uncle, Keith Carter, who was known as \\"Big Keef.\\" He lived at the Parkway Garden Homes, locally known as O-Block, located in the Washington Park neighborhood on the city's South Side, a stronghold for the Black Disciples street gang of which Chief Keef is a member.Rosemary Regina Sobol, Chief Keef pays $531 to settle speeding ticket , Chicago Tribune (July 30, 2016): \\"his former home in the Parkway Gardens apartment complex on the South Side.\\" Chief Keef has been estranged from his biological father, Alfonso Cozart, since he was a minor. His legal guardian was his grandmother with whom he lived in Chicago. He began rapping as a 5-year-old using his mother's karaoke machine and tapes to record his music. During his childhood, Chief Keef attended Dulles Elementary School and the Banner School, a therapeutic day school. He dropped out of Dyett High School at age 15. =Early years, Finally Rich, and subsequent mixtapes (2011–13)= Kanye West, a fellow Chicagoan, remixed Keef's single \\"I Don't Like,\\" raising his profile. In 2011, Chief Keef first attracted local attention from Chicago's South Side community with his mixtapes, The Glory Road and Bang. In December, he was arrested for firing a gun from his car in Chicago's Washington Park neighborhood; he was placed under house arrest at his grandmother's residence for 30 days, followed by another 30 days of home confinement. While under house arrest, he posted several videos to his YouTube account, forerunners to Chicago's hip hop subgenre, drill. Keef's song \\"I Don't Like\\" became a hit in Chicago. A local party promoter called it \\"the perfect Chicago song because 'niggas just hate everything out here'\\". It caught Kanye West's attention, and he remixed the song with rappers Pusha T, Jadakiss and Big Sean. As a result, Keef \\"suddenly shot up out of obscurity\\". In the summer of 2012, Chief Keef was the subject of a bidding war among record labels wishing to sign him, including Young Jeezy's CTE World. While 2012 proved to be a relatively quiet year in terms of his musical output, Chief Keef began the year by signing with Interscope Records. In a separate deal he was promised his own label imprint, Glory Boyz Entertainment (GBE). The deal was worth $6,000,000 over a three album layout, with an additional $440,000 advance to establish GBE. The deal gave Interscope the right to pull out of the contract if Chief Keef's debut album Finally Rich, released on December 18, 2012, had failed to sell 250,000 copies by December 2013. Featured guests on the album include rappers: 50 Cent, Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy, Rick Ross and his fellow Glory Boyz member Lil Reese. In May 2013 he signed with 1017 Brick Squad Records. Chief Keef is featured on \\"Hold My Liquor\\", the fifth track on Kanye West's album, Yeezus, released on June 18, 2013. Keef's contributions to the track were praised by musician Lou Reed who said, \\"'Hold My Liquor' is just heartbreaking, and particularly coming from where it's coming from – listen to that incredibly poignant hook from a tough guy like Chief Keef, wow.\\" On his 18th birthday, August 15, 2013, Chief Keef celebrated by releasing the mixtape Bang, Pt. 2. It was highly anticipated as the first project following his debut album, but received a mixed to negative critical response. On October 12, 2013, another mixtape, Almighty Sosa, was released. Like Bang, Pt. 2, Almighty So also received mixed to negative critical reviewss. After serving his October 2013 jail term (see § Legal issues), he began working on his second studio album and a biopic. =Nobody and Bang 3 (2014–2016)= Chief Keef began experimenting with producing his music in 2014. Meaghan Garvey of The Fader noted this was fitting as the rapper has \\"always been more concerned with vibe than meaning, and production is his most efficient tool to create a mood without getting bogged down by pesky syntax.\\" In January, Chief Keef announced he was working on a new mixtape entitled Bang 3. In February, he unveiled the cover art to his upcoming mixtape Back From The Dead 2 the sequel to his critically acclaimed mixtape, Back From The Dead. During the month, Chief Keef said his former lean addiction and bad mixing contributed to the lack of quality music on his two mixtape projects Bang Pt. 2 and Almighty So and that he was disappointed in both projects. Later in the month, he announced an EP before his second studio album Bang 3, entitled Bang 4, as a preview. The following day, Fredo Santana announced he and Chief Keef were going to release an album collaboration. In March, Keef released the first official single from Bang 3 entitled \\"Fuck Rehab\\" featuring his fellow Glo Gang artist and cousin Mario \\"Blood Money\\" Hess. This marked Hess's final recording before his death on April 9, 2014. On March 14 Chief Keef released the official music video for \\"Fuck Rehab\\". Although Interscope executive Larry Jackson announced that Bang 3 would be released on June 10, it was delayed again. In October 2014, Chief Keef was dropped by Interscope Records. He confirmed via Twitter that every project he had planned, including the release of the long-awaited Bang 3, would still be released. Young Chop criticized Interscope's decision to drop Chief Keef. Despite being set for a Christmas 2014 release, Bang 3 did not materialize. Chief Keef's mixtapes, Mansion Musick set for a November 28 release, and Thot Breakers set to release on February 14, 2015, were not released as announced. However, he was successful in releasing Big Gucci Sosa, a 12-track collaborative mixtape, with Gucci Mane, as well as Back From the Dead 2, which was made available for digital download from iTunes. Chief Keef self-produced 16 of the 20 songs on the mixtape. David Drake of Pitchfork Media said, \\"For his first steps into the rapper-producer territory, he shows promise—though it's tough to imagine most of these beats working outside the context of a Chief Keef album, as they are primed to frame his vocals.\\" Rolling Stone ranked the mixtape 25th on its list of the 40 best rap albums of 2014 commenting, \\"The bleak world from which he came still shapes his sound; it's a bleak and lonely record, with few guests and a darkly psychedelic shape formed by drugs and likely PTSD. Yet he finds a gleeful humanity inside the world's rotten core, with bluntly potent, economical rapping that gets strong mileage per word.\\" In November, he announced Nobody, a \\"Glo Producer album\\" that featured guest vocals by Kanye West and Tadoe. It was set to be released on December 2, but appeared on December 16. The album's title track was noted for being one of Keef's more emotionally driven tracks. Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound wrote \\"the track itself feels like the apex of a night spent binge-drinking.\\" The album was awarded a 7.0/10 score by Pitchfork Medias Meaghan Garvey. On February 18, 2015, Chief Keef released Sorry 4 the Weight, a 20-track mixtape. Elliott Pearson of The Alibi commented: \\"Sorry 4 the Weight is another consistent chapter in the rapper’s singular Midwestern gothic repertoire, and if 'What Up' is any indication, he’s made serious progress as a beat-maker too.\\" The mixtape was largely a solo effort, featuring only Andy Milonakis and Glo Gang labelmate, Benji Glo. In 2015, his track \\"Faneto\\" was slowly building momentum since its October 2014 release. On April 24, 2015 Chief Keef announced his next album, titled The Cozart, saying it would be released soon. He signed with FilmOn Music, a division of media tycoon Alki David, in May 2015. On July 11, 2015 Marvin Carr, better known by his stage name Capo, a longtime member of Chief Keef's Glo Gang label, was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting in Chicago. After killing Capo, the driver of the vehicle reportedly struck a stroller holding 13-month-old Dillan Harris killing him instantly. Chief Keef announced on Twitter he would be holding a free benefit concert as a tribute to Capo and encouraged concertgoers to donate to the Harris family. He also announced the formation of the Stop the Violence Now Foundation, in an attempt to decrease crime in Chicago. Because of outstanding warrants in Illinois, Keef was scheduled to attend the concert via hologram from a sound stage in Beverly Hills. The concert, organized by HologramUSA and FilmOn Music, was planned to be held in Chicago's Redmoon Theater. It faced a series of delays after Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel's office claimed Chief Keef was \\"an unacceptable role model\\" and that his music promoted violence. Chief Keef's representatives then worked out an arrangement with promoters of Craze Fest in Hammond, Indiana, to hold the concert there. Chief Keef's hologram made a plea for peace in Chicago saying, \\"Stop the violence, stop nonsense, stop the killing. Let the kids grow up,\\" before performing \\"I Don't Like\\". Fearing the concert was a threat to public safety, Hammond mayor Thomas McDermott, Jr. had the city's police department shut down the generators powering Chief Keef's hologram. McDermott was quoted as saying, \\"I know nothing about Chief Keef. All I’d heard was he has a lot of songs about gangs and shooting people — a history that’s anti-cop, pro-gang and pro-drug use. He’s been basically outlawed in Chicago, and we’re not going to let [him] circumvent Mayor Emanuel by going next door.\\" Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn criticized Emmanuel and Hammond for their decisions, claiming they infringed upon Chief Keef's First Amendment rights. =Dedication (2016–2018)= In March 2016, Chief Keef tweeted that he was retiring from rapping. The announcement came as his recorded output was slowing down. However, later in the year he was featured on MGK's song, \\"Young Man\\". He also released a 17-track mixtape Two Zero One Seven in January 2017. Chief Keef joined a long line of rappers, including Jay Z, Lupe Fiasco, Nicki Minaj and others, who claimed to have retired only to return to making music. Chief Keef released four mixtapes in the lead up to releasing his third album, Dedication, on December 1, 2017. The Guardian called Dedication his \\"most satisfying album to date.\\" In 2018, Chief Keef was able to drop more mixtapes, such as Mansion Musick and Back from the Dead 3 and more mixtapes in The Leek series. He also did more features for musicians such as Playboi Carti, Soulja Boy, and G Herbo. =Glotoven and Almighty So 2 (2019–present)= In early 2019, Chief Keef and Zaytoven worked together in the studio. Chief Keef later confirmed they were making a collaborative mixtape called Glotoven. It was released on March 15, 2019, and was supported by the single \\"Sky Kid\\". On April 20, 2019, Chief Keef revealed he had another mixtape planned, dubbed Almighty So 2. He then released a song with Youngboy Never Broke Again called \\"Fireman\\". The mixtape is also scheduled to have features from Lil Uzi Vert, Soulja Boy and Lil Reese, among others. Chief Keef also released another single titled \\"Boost\\". In March 2020, Chief Keef earned his first major production credit on Lil Uzi Vert's second studio album, Eternal Atake, with the song \\"Chrome Heart Tags\\". Chief Keef was later featured on Uzi's album Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2 with a vocal performance on the song \\"Bean (Kobe)\\", which became his highest-charting song on the Hot 100 at number 19. Other ventures =Glo Gang= As part of his contract with Interscope Records, Chief Keef's label imprint, Glory Boyz Entertainment (GBE), was established. He and his manager, Rovan Manuel, each owned 40% of GBE's shares. Chief Keef's cousin and fellow rapper, Fredo Santana, his uncle Alonzo Carter, and Anthony H. Dade, owned the remaining 20% of GBE. Various associates would be signed with the label, such as rappers Lil Reese, Fredo Santana and producer Young Chop. The label had been active since 2011 but had only released mixtapes and was not a fully functioning record company. After releasing Chief Keef's Finally Rich in December 2012, the label was set to release an album by Lil Reese in the following months, along with various mixtapes. However, on January 3, 2014, Chief Keef said that Glory Boyz Entertainment was \\"no more,\\" and he was starting a new record label named Glo Gang. Prior to his death, Blood Money revealed in an interview the members of Glo Gang were Chief Keef, Tray Savage, Ballout, Capo, Tadoe, Justo, and himself. Current artists * Chief Keef * Tadoe * Ballout * Lil Flash * Benji Flo * JusGlo Former artists * Lil Reese * Tray Savage * Fredo Santana * Capo * Blood Money * SD * Snap Dogg Personal life At the age of 16, Chief Keef had his first child, a daughter, born Kayden Kash Cozart—nicknamed Kay Kay. He was served with a request for child support by the child's mother. In November 2013, DNA documents revealed that he had fathered a 10-month-old daughter, and was subsequently ordered to begin paying child support. In September 2014, Chief Keef announced the birth of his third child, and his first son, whom he named Krüe Karter Cozart. In May 2015, he was sued by another woman who claimed he is the father of her child. Since he had failed to respond to the legal documents with which he was served, he was ordered to appear in court. After failing to do so, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. Despite these issues, LA Weekly reported that at least on Instagram Chief Keef \\"appears to take fatherhood seriously.\\" In August 2015, he caused a controversy after naming his newborn son Sno \\"FilmOn Dot Com,\\" inspired by his record label, FilmOn Music, to promote his album Bang 3. Nevertheless, following a dispute over the child's paternity, FilmOn Music retracted the name until the matter is settled. Two of his cousins, Fredo Santana and Tadoe, were signed to his Glory Boyz Entertainment label. His step-brother was shot dead on January 2, 2013. Another of his cousins, Mario Hess, also known as Big Glo, who performed under the stage name Blood Money, was shot and killed in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood on April 9, 2014. Hess had been signed to Interscope Records just two weeks prior to his killing. In an interview with Billboard, Chief Keef explained how Big Glo's death influenced his life saying, \\"When that happened that was the biggest lesson. It told me 'You gotta grow up.'\\" After being evicted from his Highland Park home, he relocated to Los Angeles. In an interview with Noisey's Rebecca Haithcoat, Chief Keef told her his favorite part about Los Angeles is, \\"the quiet\\". After moving to Los Angeles, he began indulging in his new-found hobby of art collecting, once he discovered the paintings of art teacher Bill da Butcher while in rehab. Once acquainted, da Butcher began working on paintings personally meant for Chief Keef. He believed that his move to Los Angeles benefited him; in an interview with Billboard, he said: \\"I got away from all the unnecessary trouble. It's better out here [in L.A.] than in Chicago, because I got in so much trouble. I like living out here. I think it improved me. It changed me, and [inspired] me to go somewhere bigger.\\" =Legal issues= On January 27, 2011, Chief Keef was apprehended on charges of heroin manufacture and distribution. As a juvenile offender, he was determined to be a \\"delinquent\\", rather than guilty of his charges, and served time under house arrest. In December 2011, he left his grandmother's home holding a coat over his hands in front of his waistband. A policeman stopped to question the rapper. He dropped the coat, flashed a handgun and ran away. Officers chased the then-16-year-old, who turned around several times and pointed the gun at them. The policemen \\"discharged their weapons\\" but missed. They caught him and recovered the loaded pistol. Chief Keef was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm on a police officer and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He was also given a misdemeanor charge for resisting arrest. He was held in the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center until a judge sentenced him to home confinement at his grandmother's house. On September 5, 2012, Chicago Police stated Chief Keef was being investigated for a possible connection to the shooting death of fellow rapper and Englewood resident, Joseph Coleman, who performed under the stage name \\"Lil JoJo\\". This began after Chief Keef had mocked his death on Twitter, which he later claimed was the result of his account being hacked. Coleman's mother has openly maintained Chief Keef paid to have her son killed. Cook County prosecutors asked a judge to remand him to juvenile detention for alleged parole violations on October 17, 2012. This was in response to a video interview he held at a shooting range which included footage of him discharging a firearm. A hearing was set for November 20, 2012, which was subsequently delayed and moved up to January 15, 2013. The court ordered Pitchfork Media, which had posted the now removed video, to provide the interview's footage. On December 31, 2012, Chief Keef was issued a judicial summons for a new and unrelated alleged parole violation. Prosecutors claimed he failed to notify his juvenile parole officer of a change of address. A hearing was set for January 2, 2013. Although prosecutors requested that he be jailed, Cook County judge Carl Anthony Walker allowed him to remain free, saying he had not been presented with \\"any credible evidence\\" to warrant incarceration. Chief Keef was taken into custody on January 15, 2013, after a juvenile court judge ruled that the gun range interview video constituted a probation violation. Two days later, he was sentenced to two months in a juvenile detention facility and was made a ward of the state. He was released on March 14, 2013. On January 17, 2013, Chief Keef was sued by Washington, D.C.-based promotion company Team Major for $75,000 for a missed show. According to the firm, he was supposed to perform at The O2 Arena in London on December 29, 2012. He never showed up and neither he nor his label has explained why he missed the date. He ignored the lawsuit, and the court ordered him to pay $230,019 damages to Team Major by default. He was arrested in an upscale hotel in DeKalb County, Georgia, for allegedly smoking marijuana in public and for disorderly conduct on May 20, 2013. He was released later in the day. Eight days later, Chief Keef was arrested for driving 110 mph in a 55 mph zone in his hometown of Chicago, and for driving with an unlawful number of passengers. He was later released on bond. He returned to court on June 17 and pleaded guilty to speeding. He was ordered to pay a $531 fine, serve 18 months of probation, complete 60 hours of community service and undergo random drug tests. On October 15, 2013, Keef returned to jail for a 20-day sentence for a probation violation after testing positive for marijuana. On October 24, 2013, he was released early for good behavior. However, on November 6, 2013, Chief Keef was jailed on another probation violation. Following a stint in rehab, Chief Keef was arrested on March 5, 2014, in Highland Park, Illinois, for driving under the influence of marijuana, driving on a suspended license and was cited for having no proof of insurance. On February 4, 2014, Kim Productions filed suit against him to recover losses they allege were incurred after he failed to appear at a RapCure benefit concert in Cleveland, Ohio, in June 2013. The suit alleges that Kim Productions provided him with a $15,000 deposit for the performance. The lawsuit also alleges that as a result of his failure to appear, the concert had to be cancelled. In June 2014, Chief Keef was evicted from his Highland Park home. Although Bal Bansal, the owner of the house, maintained he was a good tenant and that his departure from the home was voluntary, police confirmed it was an eviction. In January 2017, he was arrested for allegedly beating up and robbing a producer by the name of Ramsay Tha Great. He claimed that Chief Keef stole his Rolex watch and pointed firearms at him. These charges were dropped for lack of evidence. Chief Keef was arrested in South Dakota for smoking cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia in June 2017. He was able to make bail and took the charges to trial. In April 2019 he pleaded no contest and was given a suspended sentence. Image Chief Keef is often seen as a representation of the \\"Chiraq\\" gangsta rap culture that is present in Chicago. He often refers to himself as \\"Sosa\\" as do his peers and the media. The nickname \\"Sosa\\" is a reference to Alejandro Sosa, the drug kingpin in the movie Scarface. LA Weekly reported that Chief Keef's Glo Gang entourage respects the rapper. One member of the Glo Gang, Ballout, stated, \\"We learned all that from Sosa, we be in the studio with him so much,\\" calling him, \\"a rhyming machine. A music genius. Black Justin Bieber, if you ask me.\\" The New York Times stated that Chief Keef \\"symbolizes\\" Chicago's drill music scene and is the \\"best known of the young generation of Chicago rappers.\\" In November 2012, Lucy Stehlik of The Guardian described Chief Keef as drill's \\"alpha male\\". David Drake of Pitchfork Media wrote, \\"Chief Keef is in rarefied air for street rap—a creative voice with an original, cohesive aesthetic,\\" adding, \\"to the grassroots, among a new generation of stars, he sits at street rap’s aesthetic center, not its margins.\\" Chief Keef has drawn comparisons to 50 Cent. A The New York Times article compared Chief Keef to 50 Cent, noting that, like him, Chief Keef makes thuggery, \\"a major part of his early-career persona.\\" Lupe Fiasco, who has been involved in a controversy with him, has been referred to as an \\"antagonist\\" to Chief Keef's more gangsta-rap persona. The New York Times writes, \\"Lupe Fiasco is a stern and didactic teacher, but it’s arguable that Chief Keef’s music is far better at ringing warning bells.\\" Another rapper, Common, has praised his contributions to rap saying, \\"I think Chief Keef brought something that nobody else was doing and he brought it raw. He brought it real. With that, I have to respect that as an artist that he has come and brought that.\\" Other rappers, such as Rhymefest and Lupe Fiasco, however, have been critical of Chief Keef. In June 2012, Rhymefest authored a blog post critical of his image and message, describing him as a \\"bomb\\" and a \\"spokesman for the Prison Industrial Complex\\". The post was also critical of rappers Waka Flocka Flame and Rick Ross, citing similar issues. Rhymefest reiterated these views in a subsequent interview with Salon. Lupe Fiasco's criticisms of Keef touched off a feud between the two. Influence Many publications have referred to Chief Keef as a highly influential figure in contemporary hip-hop, for both his musical style and gangster image. His melodic style of rapping and his characteristically slurred delivery of lyrics has been called the catalyst for the success of mumble rap, and an influence on a large number of modern artists such as Young Thug, 21 Savage, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Lil Pump, XXXTentacion, Lil Uzi Vert and Juice Wrld, among others. Additionally, Chief Keef's heavy use of adlibs, specifically the word \\"aye\\" as a large part of a song was a major influence on the Soundcloud rap subgenre and the artists that emerged from it. Controversies =Hip hop feuds= In an August 2012 interview with Baltimore radio station 92Q Jams (WERQ-FM), Lupe Fiasco stated that Chief Keef \\"scares\\" him and described him as a \\"hoodlum\\" and a representative of Chicago's \\"skyrocketing\\" murder rate. A tweet from Chief Keef's account threatening Fiasco was posted on September 5. Chief Keef claimed that his account had been hacked and the tweet was not his. On September 13, 2012, Fiasco released a video interview in which he made amends to Chief Keef. In November 2014, rap group Migos and Glo Gang member, Capo, were involved in a physical altercation in a Chicago restaurant. Later, Chief Keef uploaded an image onto Instagram featuring an alleged stolen chain belonging to rapper Quavo of Migos. Though this incident escalated the already existing tension between the two groups' members, the feud seemingly ended. Chief Keef was involved in a feud with rapper 6ix9ine in May 2018. This stemmed from Tadoe's domestic abuse and relationship issues relating to fellow rapper Cuban Doll. She was in a relationship with Tadoe but also friendly with 6ix9ine. 6ix9ine then dissed Chief Keef and rapper Lil Reese on social media posting a video of his semi-romantic vacation to Hawaii with Cuban Doll to Instagram,6ix9ine shows off Cuban Doll amid Tadoe – Vlad TV reports on 6ix9ine and driving up to Chief Keef's old neighborhood and taunting him.6ix9ine Escalates Feud With Chief Keef – Hot New Hip Hop Report on 6ix9ine Beef He also contacted Aereon Clark, known professionally as Slim Danger, the mother of one of Chief Keef's sons and recorded himself buying her designer clothes, verbally taunting Chief Keef and later receiving fellatio from her.6ix9ine takes Chief Keef babymama on Shopping Spree – XXL Mag ReportingSlim Danger admits to performing fellatio on 6ix9ine – Vlad TV Reporting On May 8, 2018, Trippie Redd previewed the song \\"I Kill People\\" on Instagram, featuring Chief Keef and Tadoe, which was aimed as a diss toward 6ix9ine and Cuban Doll.Trippie Redd joins GloGang's Beef with 6ix9ine – Decoding Lyrics On June 2, 2018, Chief Keef was fired upon outside the W Hotel in New York City. He was not hit and there were no injuries from the incident. Due to the ongoing feud, 6ix9ine was confirmed to be under investigation by the New York Police Department for possible involvement in the incident despite being in Los Angeles at the time. In February 2019, 6ix9ine pleaded guilty to ordering the shooting of Chief Keef. He had offered his associate Kintea \\"Kooda B\\" McKenzie $20,000 to shoot at Cozart. 6ix9ine was later found to be an informant for the U.S. Government helping to lock up Kooda B, and his manager Kifano \\"Shotti\\" Jordan. =Instagram= On September 15, 2012, Chief Keef uploaded an obscene photograph of him receiving fellatio from a female fan onto Instagram, which he removed shortly afterwards. However, his account was subsequently banned for violating Instagram's terms of service. He has since created another Instagram account, and has had his activities on the app mentioned by various outlets.

Known as the Kozhiglover Rav after his short term as Rav of Koziegłowy, he served as rosh yeshiva of the yeshiva in Sochaczew (Sochatchov) from 1910 to 1914 and rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin, the premier yeshiva of Poland, from 1934 to 1939. During the German Occupation of Poland, he was incarcerated in the Warsaw Ghetto. In spring 1943 he was deported to the Majdanek concentration camp, where he was murdered. His book of responsa, Eretz Tzvi (Land of the Deer) is widely quoted to this day. Family background Frumer was born in Czeladź, Poland,Manela, A. \\"HaGaon HaRav Aryeh Tzvi Fromer of Kozhiglov, Hy\\"d\\". Hamodia Kinyan HaChag, April 6, 2017, pp. 30–33. to Hanoch Hendel Frumer, a tailor.\\"ואלה תולדות רבי אריה צבי פרומר זצוק\\"ל (These Are the Generations: Rabbi Aryeh Tzvi Frumer) \\" (in Hebrew). Recollections of Israel Ehrlich, printed in HaTzofeh, 21 Shevat 5736 (January 23, 1976). Reprinted in Eretz Tzvi (1976), pp. 6-11. He had one brother, Reuven, and two sisters, Taibel Leah and Faigel. His mother, Miriam Kayla, died when he was three years old. After his father remarried, he was sent to learn in a cheder in the nearby town of Wolbrum, where he boarded with his mother's relatives. Here he proved himself to have a sharp mind and understanding. People began calling him by the Yiddish translation of his name, \\"Leib Hirsch\\". At the age of 12 he went to learn in the yeshiva ketana in Amstov, near Częstochowa, where he outpaced boys his own age in their studies. A year later, after his bar mitzvah, he moved to the yeshiva of the Sochatchover Rebbe, the Avnei Nezer, in Sochaczew. Here Frumer found fellow students at the same high intellectual level as he, and grew into a Torah scholar of note. He became a devout Sochatchover Hasid, and went on to serve the first three Sochatchover Rebbes. Rav and rosh yeshiva At age 18 Frumer married his cousin, Esther Schweitzer, daughter of Yehuda Shraga Schweitzer of Lvov, and was supported by his father-in-law in the latter's home in Mysłowice so he could continue his Torah studies. In 1913 Frumer published his first book, Siach HaSadeh, a series of essays explaining topics in the Gemara, especially those in Seder Moed. In 1910, upon the death of the Avnei Nezer, his son and successor, Rabbi Shmuel Bornsztain, appointed the 26-year-old Frumer to succeed his late father as rosh yeshiva in the yeshiva in Sochaczew. This yeshiva enrolled hundreds of young men and operated until the outbreak of World War I. During World War I the city of Sochaczew and the yeshiva were destroyed in a fire, and Frumer moved with his family to Warsaw. At war's end, when the second Sochatchover Rebbe relocated to Zgierz, Frumer succeeded his uncle, Rabbi Yitzchok Gutensztain, as Rav of Koziegłowy. He established a yeshiva in his home which grew to 50 students. Thereafter he became known as the Kozhiglover Rav. Frumer was forced to leave the city in 1921, either due to the enmity of a neighboring priest or a disgruntled rich man who had lost a din Torah. Sochatchover Hasidim living in Zawiercie asked him to serve as their Rav and he acquiesced. He also established a yeshiva in that city.Rosenberg, Yizi. \\"Memories of My Youth\\", in Yizkor Book of the Holy Community of Zawiercie and Environs (Poland), S. Spivak, ed. Tel Aviv: Former residents of Zawiercie and Vicinity, 1948, p. 478. A while later, Frumer was nominated to be the Rav of Zawiercie, but lost to another candidate, and moved with his yeshiva to nearby Sosnowiec. With each move, he gained more students and more admirers from surrounding towns, leading to the decision of the directors of Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin, the premier yeshiva of Poland, to invite him in 1934 to be the successor to Rabbi Meir Shapiro, who had died suddenly in late 1933. Frumer brought \\"a new spirit of scholarship, righteousness, and depth\\" to the hundreds of exceptional students at Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin. He served as rosh yeshiva until the Germans closed down the yeshiva in 1939. In 1935 Frumer spent four months visiting Palestine. In 1938 he published his second work, ארץ צבי (Eretz Tzvi) (the title being another name for the Land of Israel and a play on his own name), a book of responsa concerning practical laws in the Shulchan Aruch, section Orach Chaim. This work included his responses to queries from such Torah luminaries as the Gerrer Rebbe. It has been noted for its unique approach to halacha, using non- halakhic and kabbalistic sources to solve halachic problems, and is still widely quoted to this day. Frumer also produced an anonymous pamphlet titled עיקרי דיני תפילה (Main Laws of Prayer), which was widely read in prewar Poland. At the second Siyum HaShas in Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin in June 1938, Frumer initiated the Mishnah Yomit worldwide daily study program, as a complement to the Daf Yomi daily Talmud study program.Shlomi, B. \\"Daf Yomi: A Lifeline as the Holocaust Looms\\". Hamodia Magazine, 17 May 2012, p. 16. Warsaw Ghetto After the Germans closed down Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin, Frumer fled to Warsaw and moved into the Warsaw Ghetto, where he continued to study Torah and produce chidushim (original Torah insights). He and another Sochatchover Hasid, Rabbi Avremele Weinberg, directed the clandestine education of several hundred Sochatchover yeshiva students in the ghetto under the direction of the third Sochatchover Rebbe, Rabbi Dovid Bornsztain, who was also incarcerated there. As the Nazi deportations increased in frequency, Frumer and his Rebbe joined other Torah scholars who disguised themselves as workers in a large shoe factory owned by Fritz Schulz. Frumer worked in the Wooden and Fur Shoe section, which produced wooden clogs and fur slippersKaliv World Center, Shema Yisrael (2002), p. 103. and supplied footwear for the German soldiers on the Russian front. While he worked, he reviewed his Torah studies by heart. Twelve days after the Warsaw ghetto uprising, Frumer and his family were deported with other Jews to the Majdanek concentration camp. Frumer was murdered a few days later, on May 2, 1943 (27 Nisan 5703). It was reported that as he was taken to the gas chamber, he clapped his hands and proclaimed aloud, \\"Let us sanctify God's Name with joy.

This type of bullfighting is peculiar to the Azores, and is composed of events with four adult bulls of the breed brava da ilha Terceira along a designated road or street around 500 metres in length. The bull is controlled by a rope around its neck, held by six people (pastores) that direct the bull and prevent its leaving the field of play. The bull is led along the course of the road, and taunted and teased by players, but with no intent to kill the animal; the animal's horns are capped with balls or leather to diminish the risk to the players. All the bulls are released after each event in order to rest before the next event (at least three weeks). Portuguese immigrants from the Azores also practice tourada à corda in the city of Brampton, southern Ontario, Canada. History The first known tourada à corda was in 1622, organised by the Câmara de Angra during the celebrations in honour of the canonisation of saints Francis Xavier and Ignatius of Loyola. It is presumed by the inclusion of the touradas in the festivities that they were already a popular event.  Sources * Diário Insular, 5 February 2009.

It was directed by British television director Jon Jones and the screenplay was written by Andrew Davies. Felicity Jones stars as the protagonist Catherine Morland and JJ Feild plays her love interest Henry Tilney. The story unfolds as the teenaged Catherine is invited to Bath to accompany some family friends. There she finds herself the object of Henry Tilney's and John Thorpe's (William Beck) affections. When she is asked to stay at Northanger Abbey, Catherine's youthful and naive imagination takes hold and she begins to confuse real life with the Gothic romance of her favorite novels. Northanger Abbey was one of three novels adapted for ITV's Jane Austen season. It was shot on location in Ireland from late August 2006 on a budget of £2 million. The drama was co-produced by Granada Productions and American studio WGBH Boston. Northanger Abbey premiered on 25 March 2007 in the United Kingdom and on 16 December 2007 in Canada. It was broadcast in the United States and Australia in 2008. The drama was viewed by 5.6 million people in the UK, making it the second most watched of the 2007 adaptations. Northanger Abbey garnered mostly positive reviews from television critics, with many praising the cast's performances. Plot Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland (Felicity Jones), daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Morland (Gerry O'Brien and Julia Dearden), is a tomboy with a wild imagination and a passion for Gothic novels. Family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen (Desmond Barrit and Sylvestra Le Touzel), invite Catherine to spend the season in Bath and she readily accepts. At her first ball, Catherine meets and dances with Henry Tilney (JJ Feild). The following day, Catherine makes the acquaintance of the Thorpe family. She becomes good friends with Isabella Thorpe (Carey Mulligan) and she meets Isabella's brother, John (William Beck), when she is reunited with her own brother, James (Hugh O'Conor). John flirts with Catherine at a ball, but she is more interested in meeting with Henry and his sister, Eleanor (Catherine Walker). Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite her having made plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton to Wick Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney (Liam Cunningham), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her to spend the day with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does. On her return home, Isabella tells Catherine that she and James are engaged. James and John announce that they are to leave Bath for a few weeks and after talking about marriage with Catherine, John leaves believing she is in love with him. Isabella catches the eye of Henry's older brother, Captain Frederick Tilney (Mark Dymond), and flirts with him after she learns how low James' income will be. General Tilney invites Catherine to stay with his family at Northanger Abbey and she accepts. When Isabella tells Catherine that John is going to propose to her, Catherine tells her friend to write to him and explains that he is mistaken. Isabella continues to flirt with Frederick and Catherine asks Henry to convince his brother to leave her alone. However, he tells Catherine that Frederick will be leaving town soon to re-join his regiment. Catherine states that Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she imagined it and she becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that perhaps it is possible to read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother has no intention of marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing. General Tilney returns home from a trip away and orders Eleanor to send Catherine home to Fullerton that night. Catherine endures the trip alone and believes that Henry told the General about her suspicions. A few days later, Henry comes to Fullerton and explains that the General discovered that Catherine's family were not as rich as John led him to believe. He apologises for his father's actions and explains that even though he will probably be disinherited, he loves Catherine and proposes. Catherine accepts and the couple marry. Production =Conception and adaptation= On 10 November 2005, Julia Day from The Guardian reported ITV controller of drama, Nick Elliott, had ordered three new adaptations of Mansfield Park, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion. Elliot commented that the adaptations would be \\"important remakes for the new generation\\". He explained, \\"About every 10 years, all the great stories need retelling. These films will be very much 2007 films... we've asked and pushed the production team to make them young. Her stories always make great TV drama and our Jane Austen season will feature the absolute cream of British acting talent.\\" Elliott revealed that he had deliberately shied away from ordering adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility to focus on Austen's lesser known works. Each of the productions were made by a different company, cast and directors, so they had \\"a distinct look\\". They were also made to appeal to a younger audience that might have previously switched off other Austen adaptations. Northanger Abbey was given a budget of £2 million, and it marked only the second filmed adaptation of the book; with the first being made and broadcast in 1986. Andrew Davies, the screenwriter who adapted Pride and Prejudice for the BBC, was commissioned to write the script for Northanger Abbey. He had previously written an adaptation of the novel for Weekend Television in 1998. It was optioned by Harvey Weinstein for Miramax Films and drafts from other writers were added, before the project was abandoned. Davies told The Daily Telegraph's Hugh Davies that Northanger Abbey was much more straightforward to adapt than Pride and Prejudice, which was \\"quite a fiendish bit of compression\\". The reporter explained, \\"A young heroine thinks she has stumbled across a Gothic conspiracy of murder and concealed corpses. In fact, the true crimes are those of psychological cruelty and selfishness. Davies said that part of the back story was having the heroine read the 1764 best-seller The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole, which he uses to fill Catherine's head with the expectation of unspeakable secrets in the Abbey.\\" The writer admitted that he used artistic license when it came to the scene in which Catherine's friend, Isabella, goes off with Captain Frederick Tilney. Austen did not state what happened to them in the novel, but Davies believed Frederick would have seduced Isabella. During an interview with Marion McMullen from the Coventry Evening Telegraph, Davies explained that the Gothic elements to the novel gave him inspiration to add dream sequences and fantasies to the script. He told McMullen, \\"I've been very faithful to the book, but one of the differences has been writing the scenes showing Catherine's fantasies. Catherine is a great reader of horror fiction – the gothic novel was fairly popular in those days, like a young girl today who would read a lot of rather steamy romances. In this production, we see some of Catherine's fantasies, some of which are quite steamy for a young girl.\\" Davies admitted that he was proud of his reputation for \\"sexing up\\" the novels he had adapted and commented that none of his scenes were gratuitous. He told McMullen that he often looked for excuses to get the characters out of their clothes, as he felt they were always being \\"buttoned up to the neck\\". Producer Keith Thompson said Davies had made Northanger Abbey a bit more erotic than the novel and thought the script had \\"a wonderful cheekiness to it.\\" Davies chose to use a narrator to speak Austen's words and help set the scene at the beginning and end of the film. =Casting= Felicity Jones portrayed Northanger Abbey's heroine, Catherine Morland. Karen Price from the Western Mail reported ITV were looking for \\"big names\\" and promised the best British acting talent, while they were casting the three adaptations. In July 2006, Thompson revealed the cast had yet to be confirmed and that the casting agent, John Hubbard, was \\"scouring\\" Ireland and the United Kingdom for actors to fit the roles. On 14 August, a writer for the Irish Film and Television Network stated the casting for Northanger Abbey had finished and had been confirmed. British actress Felicity Jones was chosen to play Catherine, the protagonist and eldest daughter of the Morland family. Jones received the part upon her first audition, just two weeks after graduating from Oxford University. She revealed that she really wanted the role, explaining \\"sometimes when you read a script, you think 'God, I'd love to do that.'\\" While speaking of his fondness for the characters, Davies commented that Jones' casting as Catherine was \\"perfect\\". American-born actor JJ Feild was cast as Henry Tilney, the \\"highly eligible young clergyman\\", and William Beck received the role of John Thorpe, Henry's rival for Catherine's affections. Actress Carey Mulligan was given the role of Catherine's shallow and selfish friend Isabella Thorpe. The actress had previously worked with Davies on an adaptation of Bleak House. Speaking to Graham Fuller of The Arts Desk, Mulligan commented, \\"I wanted to play Isabella because I'd never played a character like that before.\\" Irish actor Hugh O'Conor was chosen to play James Morland, Catherine's brother and Isabella's fiancé. Other Irish actors cast in the production included Liam Cunningham as the \\"eccentric\\" General Tilney and Gerry O'Brien and Julia Dearden as Mr. and Mrs. Morland respectively. Desmond Barrit and Sylvestra Le Touzel were cast as Mr. and Mrs. Allen, the wealthier older couple that invites Catherine to go to Bath with them. Le Touzel previously portrayed Fanny Price in the 1983 adaptation of Mansfield Park. Catherine Walker and Mark Dymond appeared as Henry's siblings Eleanor and Captain Tilney. Geraldine James was credited as the narrator and voice of Austen. =Filming= Lismore Castle served as Northanger Abbey Northanger Abbey was shot on location in Ireland from late August 2006. The Independent's Sarah Shannon stated that ITV had filmed in the country \\"largely thanks to the generous tax incentives offered by the republic's government.\\" Filming lasted for five weeks and the drama was shot on Super 16 mm film. Twenty-first century Dublin streets doubled for nineteenth century Bath, the setting for the novel. Shannon thought some viewers might be annoyed with this and Thompson commented, \\"But isn't that shot of the Royal Crescent in Bath a bit of a cliché? What we've done is create our own Bath.\\" Lismore Castle in County Waterford was chosen as Northanger Abbey, home of the Tilney family. Higginsbrook House, near County Meath, served as the exterior to the Morland family's home. The house was later used in Becoming Jane, a film about Austen's early life. Other shooting locations included Dublin Castle, Ardbraccan House and Charleville Castle. Jones told Paul Byrne of the Evening Herald that she enjoyed shooting in Ireland as she got to see a lot of the country. =Music and choreography= British composer Charlie Mole wrote the score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions were the most taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them to make sure they were right. She explained, \\"But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!\\" Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added \\"the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!\\" Promotion and broadcast ITV launched a nationwide campaign to promote its Jane Austen Season. The campaign included three television adverts and cinema, outdoor and press adverts. ITV Creative made the 20, 30 and 60 second promotional trailers, which began airing on ITV channels from 25 February 2007. The following day adverts began appearing in selected national press publications. The outdoor and press adverts were created by M&C; Saatchi and MindShare carried out the media buying. Northanger Abbey was the second of the Austen adaptations to be shown in the UK. It was broadcast on ITV at 9:00 pm on 25 March 2007. The drama aired on the TVOntario channel in Canada on 16 December 2007. Northanger Abbey was shown on 20 January 2008 on the US channel PBS as part of their Austen Masterpiece Theatre series. On 15 June, the film was broadcast on Australia's ABC1 channel. =Home media= Northanger Abbey was released on a single disc DVD and as part of a box-set in the UK on 26 March 2007. The Region 1 DVD was released on 22 January 2008. In April of that year, ITV announced they would be making a range of classic programmes, including the adaptation of Northanger Abbey, available to purchase through the iTunes Store. Reception Upon its first broadcast in the United Kingdom, Northanger Abbey was viewed by 5.6 million people and had a 26.6% audience share. This made it the second most popular of the adaptations, behind Mansfield Park. 931,000 Australians watched the drama when it aired on ABC1 in June 2008. Northanger Abbey garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. Shortly before it aired in the UK, reporters for four newspaper publications selected the drama as their \\"Pick of the Day.\\" Jade Wright of the Liverpool Echo thought the adaptation had showed \\"a good-natured and frank Catherine\\", with Jones managing to \\"combine humility and humour with perfect aplomb.\\" Wright praised the decision to cast Mulligan and said the actress \\"shone\\" as Isabella. A The Guardian reporter included Northanger Abbey in their feature on the week's television highlights, saying \\"Yes, yes, more Austin, but Andrew Davies' adaptation of one of her lighter novels is the perfect Sunday evening blend of eruditeness and pretty frocks.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald's Lenny Ann Low also praised the cast and their performances, stating \\"Lush with straining bosoms, knowing looks and segments bringing Morland's wild dreams and fantasies to life, Northanger Abbey is well cast. Felicity Jones catches Morland's mix of youthful naivety, heart-whole feelings and mindful beliefs perfectly and J.J. Feild, as the dishy but sensible Tilney, grows in appeal as this feature-length drama builds to a climax.\\" Low's colleague, Joyce Morgan later selected Northanger Abbey as one of the week's best television programmes. However, Ruth Ritchie, writing for the same newspaper, stated that the makers of the adaptation tried \\"desperately to create an air of mystery about the dastardly deeds at Northanger Abbey,\\" but the audience knew it was about as scary as \\"a ninja turtle.\\" Ritchie likened the ITV Austen adaptations to a \\"Posh Country Home and Away.\\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"Northanger Abbey the novel was as fun as it gets for Austen, and the television film quite lives up to the same standard.\\" Ginia Bellafante, a critic for The New York Times, proclaimed the drama gave the audience \\"innocent faces and heaving breasts, hyperbolizing the sex that always lurks beneath the surface of Austen's astringent presence.\\" She went on to say Northanger Abbey was made to be a television movie and commented that it was more fun than the book. The San Francisco Chronicle's David Wiegand wrote \\"Persuasion is a bigger challenge to try to squeeze into 90 minutes, the real difference between that film and Northanger is the latter's consistency of high-quality performances, a careful and attentive adaptation by Andrew Davies and solid direction by Jon Jones.\\" Writing for The Daily Telegraph, James Walton observed \\"Northanger Abbey was a perfectly acceptable costume drama – but not one that ever really caught fire.\\" Simon Hoggart, writing for The Spectator, commented that Davies's adaptation of Northanger Abbey \\"was much bolder and more confident than Mansfield Park the week before.\\" The Hollywood Reporter's Ray Bennett praised Northanger Abbey, calling it \\"a wonderfully evocative version\\", which was \\"written with flair and imagination by Andrew Davies\\". He proclaimed \\"Capturing vividly the flush and wonder of adolescence, the film mines Austen's first-written but last-published novel to find purest nuggets of wit, romance and social satire. The story's 18th-century heroine, Catherine Morland, has a fevered imagination and Davies draws on Austen's droll illustrations of it to create scenes of gothic adventure.\\" Bennett added \\"the film is shot beautifully by Ciarán Tanham while composer Charlie Mole's score adds to the quickening pace of Catherine's fantasies.\\" For his work on Northanger Abbey, cinematographer Tanham was nominated for Best Director of Photography at the 5th Irish Film and Television Awards.
