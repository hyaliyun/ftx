The Security Council affirmed the importance of a fully operational professional Haitian police force and the revitalisation of the legal system. In this regard, UNSMIH was established to maintain a stable environment and assist in the training of a new police force, initially until 30 November 1996. The mission would initially consist of 300 policemen and 600 troops. Haiti also had to quickly receive additional financial support from international institutions for the reconstruction of the country. Finally, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali requested by 30 September 1996 to report on the implementation of the current resolution and to seek further opportunities to reduce the operational costs of UNSMIH.

He was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL) in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He won Super Bowl XLVIII with the Seahawks over the Denver Broncos, and he also played for the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. He played college football at Oregon. He also played recreational softball in Philly in spring 2016 under the pseudonym Dick Mahoney.http://www.csnphilly.com/the700level/legend-dick-mahoney Thurmond was a founding member of the historically great Seahawks defensive unit nicknamed the Legion of Boom. Early years Thurmond attended West Covina High School in West Covina, California, where he was a two-sport star in both football and track. Considered one of California‚Äôs fastest players, he helped lead West Covina to the CIF Southern Section Division VII championship and a 11-2-1. He recorded 29 receptions for 730 yards and seven touchdowns his senior season in addition to rushing for more than 400 yards and two more scores. He added 85 tackles and five interceptions to earn All-San Gabriel Valley Region honors. He also received All-CIF Southern Section second-team plaudits as a wide receiver in 2004 after attracting first-team All-San Antonio League, All-CIF And all-Valley attention following his 2003 campaign.http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=177420 Also a standout in track & field, Thurmond made it to the finals of the 2005 USATF Junior Championships in the 110m hurdles, placing eight (14.65 s). As a junior, he ran a season-best time of 14.29 seconds, and in the CIF State Meet, he missed the final by only .10 seconds. He owned personal-bests of 14.16 seconds in the 110m hurdles, 6-8 (2.04m) in the high jump and 15-7 (4.81m) in the pole vault.http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID;=225780 College career Thurmond played football and ran track at the University of Oregon from 2005 to 2009. He became a starter as a redshirt freshman in 2006, earning honorable mention for the all-Pac-10 team. Thurmond III once again was awarded an honorable mention all-Pac-10 in 2007. After battling injuries in 2008, Thurmond III finished with 5 interceptions, along with one in the 2008 Holiday Bowl. On September 26 against Cal, Thurmond III was hurt and did not return after a hit to the knee on the opening kickoff return. It was later determined that Thurmond III had torn three ligaments in his knee, and would miss the remainder of the 2009 season. Professional career =Seattle Seahawks= Thurmond was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the fourth round (111th overall) of the 2010 NFL draft. He was signed to a contract on June 17, 2010. He was expected to replace Kelly Jennings as the starting corner for the 2011 season. On October 24, 2011, Thurmond was placed on injured reserve with a broken fibula and high ankle sprain, ending his season. On November 24, 2013, Thurmond was suspended for four games for violating the NFL's policy on substance abuse. Super Bowl XLVIII Before the 2013 NFL season, Thurmond's previous seasons were hampered by injuries that ultimately delayed his development. Thurmond began the 2013 NFL season serving a four-game suspension then returned to replace Brandon Browner who had lost trail speed and was less effective in slot coverage. The Seahawks' secondary would ultimately thrive in 2013 with him, Brandon Browner, Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas, and Byron Maxwell all excelling together as the Legion of Boom. Thurmond defended the slot throughout the season and stepped in for the suspended Browner in the postseason to help the Seahawks franchise win its first Super Bowl, defeating the Denver Broncos, 43‚Äì8. After the success of the Seahawks' secondary, Thurmond became a coveted free agent along with former teammate Brandon Browner. =New York Giants= Thurmond was signed to a one-year deal with the New York Giants on March 16, 2014. On September 15, 2014, Thurmond was placed on injured reserve after a torn pectoral sustained in a Week 2 game against the Arizona Cardinals. =Philadelphia Eagles= On March 11, 2015, Thurmond signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles. During the off-season, Thurmond changed position to safety due to the team's lack of depth at the position. He started the season strong, intercepting 3 passes in the first 5 games, which at the time made him the NFL's co-leader in interceptions. On November 15, 2015, Thurmond converted a safety against the Dolphins in a 20‚Äì19 loss. In a week 17 win over the Giants, his former team, he intercepted Eli Manning and returned it 83 yards for a touchdown. This is recorded in professional game logs as a fumble recovery and does not count towards his interception total. Thurmond had his best year statistically, with 71 tackles, 3 interceptions, 7 pass deflections, 2 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, and 1 safety, all career highs. Although Thurmond was a sought after free agent and had offers of over $4 million per year, Thurmond decided to retire on May 31, 2016.

It is not to be confused with kudzu, a vine-like plant. When the computer boots, kudzu detects changes in the running system's hardware configuration, if any, and activates the newly detected hardware (or removal of hardware). kudzu only runs at boot time, and then exits. There is no performance penalty during normal operation. (Since Fedora release 9, kudzu is supplemented by HAL) kudzu detects and configures new and/or changed hardware on a system. When started, kudzu detects the current hardware, and checks it against a database stored in /etc/sysconfig/hwconf, if one exists. It then determines if any hardware has been added or removed from the system. If so, it gives the users the opportunity to configure any added hardware, and unconfigure any removed hardware. It then updates the database in /etc/sysconfig/hwconf. If no previous database exists, kudzu attempts to determine what devices have already been configured, by looking at /etc/modprobe.conf, /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/, and /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Options usage ‚Äîhelp, -? : Print help information. -q, --quiet : Run 'quietly'; do only configuration that doesn't require user input. -s, --safe : Do only 'safe' probes that won't disturb hardware. Currently, this disables the serial probe, the DDC monitor probe, and the PS/2 probe. -t, --timeout [seconds] : This sets the timeout for the initial dialog. If no key is pressed before the timeout elapses, kudzu exits, and /etc/sysconfig/hwconf is not updated. -k, --kernel [version] : When determining whether a module exists, use the specified kernel version. (If this is not set, it defaults to the current kernel version.) Do not specify suffixes such as 'smp' or 'summit'; these are automatically searched. -b, --bus [bus] : Only probe on the specified bus. -c, --class [class] : Only probe for the specified class. -f, --file [file] : Read hardware probe info from file file and do not do an actual probe. -p, --probe : Print probe information to the screen, and do not actually configure or unconfigure any devices. Files /etc/sysconfig/hwconf : Listing of current installed hardware. /etc/sysconfig/kudzu : Configuration for the boot-time hardware probe. Set 'SAFE' to something other than 'no' to force only safe probes. /etc/modprobe.conf : Module configuration file. /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* : Network interface configuration files. Bugs The serial probe will disturb any currently in-use devices, and returns odd results if used on machines acting as serial consoles. On some older graphics cards, the DDC probe can do strange things. Running kudzu to configure network adapters post-boot after the network has started may have unintended results.

Heather O'Grainn is a worker in the Office of Future Threat Assessment in Washington state. Aa variety of groups with diverse aims, but an overlapping desire to end modern technological society (which they call the Big System), create a nanotech plague (\\"Daybreak\\") which both destroys petroleum-based fuels, rubber and plastics and eats away any metal conductors carrying electricity. An open question in the book is whether these groups, and their shared motivations, are coordinated by some conscious actor, or whether they are an emergent property / meme that attained a critical mass. The Daybreak plague strikes, and world governments are helpless to deal with it. Industrial civilization rapidly breaks down, and tens of millions die in the U.S. alone (the global death toll measures in the billions). There is a presidential succession crisis. Just as society in the U.S. seems to start stabilizing, previously placed pure fusion weapons detonate, destroying Washington, D.C. and Chicago. This is followed by additional pure fusion weapon strikes, which are determined to be weapons that are being created on the Moon by nanotech replicators.

It follows the story of Paula who is accompanying her father to Istanbul to purchase a rare artifact of a lost pagan cult. Cybele‚Äôs Secret is the companion book to Wildwood Dancing. Background Cybele's Secret was first published in Australia in October 2007 by Pan Macmillan in trade paperback format. In December 2007 it was published in the United Kingdom by Tor Books in hardback format and in 2008 it was published in the United States by Knopf Books. Cybele‚Äôs Secret joint won the 2008 Sir Julius Vogel Award for best young-adult novel with The Sea-wreck Stranger by Anna Mackenzie. It was also a short-list nominee for the 2007 Aurealis Award for best young-adult novel but lost to Anthony Eaton's Skyfall. Synopsis/Plot Summary Cybele's Secret (pronounced Ke-beh-leh) is the sequel to Wildwood Dancing. It is narrated by Paula, the fourth sister of five and a scholar. She accompanies her father on a business trip to Istanbul to try to find a statue of the goddess Cybele. Paula's father thinks it appropriate to hire a bodyguard for Paula as the streets in the city are a dangerous place for a young, foreign woman. As Paula is about to make a decision on which man she will hire, another, named Stoyan, shows up. He admits to having left his previous boss alone and exposed, which proved fatal for the boss, but Paula hires him anyway. After a while, they go to a dinner, where Paula meets an influential lady who runs a women's only library and steam room. She invites Paula to come along one day, which Paula gladly accepts, being excited about the prospects of so many books. She begins to research Cybele, to see if it would give her a clue as to where the statue was. She knows that time is running out to find the statue; one of her father's colleagues is already murdered because of it and there are rumours of a religious cult of Cybele's followers somewhere in Istanbul. Paula finds some old records with delicate pictures around the edge, on which appear strange words that only she can see. She soon realises that the faerie folk have given her a task, as they did her older sister Jena several years ago, but does not know what it is, only having a few words from the witch Dragutsa to go off; 'You must help an old friend of mine.' Paula ropes her Stoyan into helping with the quest, and also begins to teach him how to read and write. To find the statue, Paula must join with a daring and dangerous pirate named Duarte, who has promised a friend that he would return one day to the island where they have found out that the statue is kept. Paula finds herself drawn to him as she also is to Stoyan. They set out for the island on the pirate's ship to find the statue. Paula's father does not know about this. On the island they find many perils, including the influential lady who owns the library that Paula has been using, and who turns out to be the leader of the religious cult. She admits to wanting the statue for herself and followers, and is willing to kill to get it. Paula, Stoyan and Duarte have to journey through a cave and pass certain tests such as helping Tati, (Paula's sister who goes to live with Sorrow in the Faerie realm at the end of Wildwood Dancing) without speaking to or touching her. They achieve this through Stoyan's amazing control of dogs. Then they must choose a gift each. Paula chooses a tapestry of five girls sewn to look like her and her sisters. The influential lady chooses the statue, which Paula, Duarte and Stoyan did not realise was an option. Another task is that Paula must collect three tiny creatures which sit on her arms and head. After the many tasks, they come out of the cave into another place on the island. The cave begins to collapse, shaking and dropping stones, with their opponents still inside. Faced with the choice of saving herself or dying with her guard, the cult's leader chooses to die with the guard she took such good care of the whole time. The statue is placed back where it should belong, with the villagers who live on the island and who are the true worshippers of Cybele. The adventurers return to Istanbul, upon which Paula eventually realises that yes, she is in love with Stoyan. They decide to get married back at Paula's home, which is a welcome event to everyone, including Stela, who exclaims that maybe since Tati and Jena have had their tasks, and Iulia is married, it will be her turn to go back to the Faerie realm, and she will be able to see Ildephonsus and all her other little friends again.

The Security Council stressed the importance of the timely implementation of various peace agreements, including the Lusaka Protocol, between Angolan government and UNITA. Progress had been made recently, but the overall pace of implementation was slow. Talks on the formation of an army unit had been successfully completed and there was also an agreement on forming a unity government. Respect for human rights and the demilitarisation of Angolan society was important and the recovery of the Angolan economy was essential for lasting peace. The two parties were praised for the military framework agreement and the beginning of the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan army. They had also worked on the removal of checkpoints, the re-opening of major roads and the quartering of 52,000 UNITA troops, which were all welcomed by the Council. UNITA was requested to transfer its arms and ammunition to UNAVEM III. The Angolan government had also promulgated an amnesty law and a civilian disarmament program had started. There was a reduction in hostile propaganda and all parties were reminded to cease disseminating such information. The resolution also condemned the use of mercenaries, and requested the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali by 1 October 1996 on the implementation of the current resolution.

It has been suggested that this was the first airliner ever lost to sabotage, and in the immediate aftermath, suspicion centred on one passenger, Albert Voss, who seemingly jumped from the aircraft before it crashed. Accident The aircraft was employed on Imperial's regular London‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìCologne route, which it had flown for the previous five years.Barker (1988), p. 56. On this leg of the journey the plane was travelling from Brussels to London, which route would take it north from Brussels heading over Flanders before crossing the coast for the flight across the English Channel and then making the brief traverse over the Kent countryside to land at Croydon Airport in Surrey. The two-hour journey began, slightly delayed, just after 12:30 pm.Barker (1988), p. 57. While flying over the fields of northern Belgium, the plane was seen by onlookers to catch fire before losing altitude and plunging into the ground.Barker (1988), p. 58. As the aircraft began its descent, a passenger was seen to exit the aeroplane and fall to earth without a parachute. He was later identified as Albert Voss, a German who had emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he practised as a dentist in Manchester.Barker (1988), p. 55. At approximately , the aircraft split into two sections which hit the ground separately, instantly killing all those still on board.Barker (1988), pp. 59‚Äì60. Investigation and inquest The subsequent investigation found that the fire had started towards the rear of the plane, in either the lavatory or the luggage area at the back of the cabin. No items recovered from the front portion of the wreckage showed any evidence of fire damage before the impact, nor was there any evidence of fire in the engines or fuel systems. The investigators narrowed the cause down to the firing of some combustible substance, either accidentally by a passenger or crew member or through vibration or some other natural occurrence, or deliberately by bombing.Barker (1988), pp. 60‚Äì61. At the inquest into Albert Voss's death at least one witness, his estranged brother, accused him of being culpable, claiming that Voss's business trips to the continent to buy anaesthetics masked a lucrative sideline in drug smuggling. This rumour had followed Voss for some time before his death and was alleged to have been the subject of investigations by the Metropolitan Police. Voss, according to his brother, was travelling aboard the aircraft together with his niece, and they were aware that the authorities were on to them. Under this theory, Voss sought to escape from the authorities by destroying the aircraft using various flammable substances to which his work gave him easy access and then bailing out in the confused circumstances, hoping that in the aftermath no one would notice one fewer body than there should have been.Barker (1988), pp. 61‚Äì62. An autopsy showed that, other than some minor burns, Voss was unharmed before he exited the aircraft.Barker (1988), p. 59.Barker (1988), p. 63. The inquest jury eventually returned an open verdict ‚Äì indicating that they believed his death may not have been accidental, but that they were unable, on the evidence before them, to come to a definite conclusion ‚Äì rather than the verdict of accidental death the coroner attempted to direct them towards.Barker (1988), pp. 63‚Äì64.

He was a member of the first national parliament when Nigeria gained independence in 1960. He was elected governor of Plateau State on the Nigerian People's Party (NPP) platform during the Nigerian Second Republic, holding office from October 1979 until the Military coup of 31 December 1983 that brought General Muhammadu Buhari to power. Later, he was founding chairman of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Birth and early career Lar was born in Pangna, Langtang, Plateau State in April 1933. His father was a farmer and his mother a pottery maker. He studied at the Sudan United Mission Primary School in Langtang, and then at the Gindiri Teachers College where he qualified to teach at the Primary School, Langtang. After two years he returned to Gindiri for his Senior Teacher's Training Programme, earned his Higher Elementary Certificate and started to teach at the Senior Primary School level. He planned to become a clergyman. Lar was elected as a councilor to the Langtang Natives Authority in January 1959. On 12 December 1959 he was elected to the Federal Parliament on the platform of United Middle Belt Congress (UMBC). He was reelected in 1964, and from then until 15 January 1966, when General Yakubu Gowon took power in a coup, Lar was parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. He was also a Junior Minister in the Federal Ministry of establishments. After the fall of the democratic government, Lar attended Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, graduating in 1970 with an LLB and being called to the bar in 1971. He established a private legal practice, and was co-founder and first National Secretary of the Nigerian Legal Aid Association. In 1972, Lar joined the Board of Amalgamated Tin Mines of Nigeria. He became Chairman of the Board of Directors of African Continental Bank, Member of the Nigeria Council of Legal Education and a member of the Constituent Assembly (1977‚Äì1978). He was vice-chairman of the panel chaired by Justice Ayo Irikefe that recommended expanding from 12 to 19 states during the regime of generals Murtala Muhammed and Olusegun Obasanjo. Lar was also a Board member of the USA-based World Environmental Movement for Africa. Second and Third Republics At the start of the Second Republic, Lar was a co-founder of the Nigerian People's Party. He was nominated as the party‚Äôs presidential candidate in 1978, and later won the governorship election in Plateau State as the first Executive Governor on October 1 1979. His deputy was Alhaji Aliyu Akwe Doma. He was active in building infrastructure in the state including hospitals, educational institutions, rural electrification, water supplies, and roads. He introduced reforms to state employment laws, abolishing the daily pay and contract systems and introducing paid maternity leave for nursing mothers. After the military coup in December 1983, General Muhammadu Buhari set up military tribunals which tried all former governors. Although Lar was not found guilty of embezzlement or misappropriation, he was sentenced to 88 years in prison, first in Jos and then in Kirikiri in Lagos. His case was reviewed and he was released by the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida, who started another transition to democracy in 1992. During the Nigerian Third Republic, Lar was a supporter of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He was appointed Minister of Police Affairs by the government of General Sani Abacha, later resigning when he realized Abacha was not serious about restoring democracy. Fourth Republic In the transition to the Nigerian Fourth Republic Lar became the first National Chairman of People's Democratic Party (PDP) in 1998, holding this position until 2002 when he handed over to Chief Barnabas Gemade. In February 2004 he resigned as chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, handing over to Chief Tony Anenih at a caucus in Abuja. He remained a power in the PDP until 2005, when he supported Vice President Atiku Abubakar in his falling out with President Olusegun Obasanjo, and later supported Atiku's bid for the Presidency in 2007. In April 2006, Lar also welcomed the decision of former Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida to compete for President in the 2007 elections, saying that in a democracy anyone was entitled to run. Lar has been described as an ardent Middle-Belter, an active participant in the Middle Belt Forum. In Plateau State he championed a policy based on the idea that the state should help indigenes realize the benefits of their \\"emancipation\\" from Hausa domination, and that the centuries-old Hausa and Jarawa communities in Jos and Yelwa should be relegated to non-indigene status. In an interview in February 2009 he said that the Middle Belt was being neglected despite the great contributions it made to national unity, a reference to sacrifices in the Nigerian Civil War. He also complained of discrimination against Christians in the North, to the extent that they could not get land to build a church. In February 2010 Vice President Goodluck Jonathan appointed him Chairman of the Presidential committee tasked with recommending how to prevent further violence in Jos, the capital of Plateau State. Death On 9 October 2013, Plateau state governor Jonah David Jang announced the death of Mr Lar.

It derives from Rosa chinensis, and is generally accepted as the first East Asian rose cultivar to reach Europe. It is recorded in Sweden in 1752 and in England before 1759, but was probably cultivated in China for several centuries. It is believed to be the rose which inspired the song The Last Rose of Summer by the Irish composer and poet Thomas Moore. It is also known as Parsons' Pink China, named after Mr Parson who introduced it commercially to the UK in 1793.  Description  'Old Blush' has light silvery pink semi-double flowers of medium size that darken as they age. They bloom in fives and have a light to strong tea fragrance, a cupped to flat bloom form, and an average diameter of . The red buds appear in clusters almost continuously from early June to the first frost - in warmer regions even throughout the year, and can develop to small, red rose hips. The shrub has an arching form, few prickles and mid- green leaves that have a crimson colour when young. It grows tall and about wide, tolerates half shade, poor soils, and is winter hardy down to -18 ¬∞C (USDA zone 6 to 7). The cultivar can be trained as a small climber, reaching up to height which has larger flowers.  Awards  The cultivar was one of the four cultivars inducted into the Old Rose Hall of Fame by the World Federation of Rose Societies at its creation in 1988.  Offspring  'Old Blush', together with 'Slater's Crimson China' and the tea roses 'Hume's Blush Tea-scented China' and 'Parks' Yellow Tea-scented China', introduced to European gardens roses which would bloom repeatedly from spring to fall, whereas the Old European roses tend to bloom only once, on the previous year's wood. The chinas and teas became the foundation of numerous new classes of roses, including the bourbons, noisettes, hybrid perpetuals, and thence the modern garden roses. 'Old Blush' itself was parent to two of these classes: a natural cross of 'Old Blush' with 'Autumn Damask' on the Ile de Bourbon gave rise to 'Rose Edouard', the first bourbon rose; and John Champneys' hybrid of 'Old Blush' with the musk rose was 'Champneys' Pink Cluster', the first noisette and parent of the better known 'Blush Noisette'. Two well-known sports of 'Old Blush' are 'Climbing Old Blush' (known since about 1750), one of the best climbers with slightly larger flowers than its parent, and 'Viridiflora', a green cultivar, that was introduced by Bambridge & Harrison in 1845.

Each branch has its own system and sequence of courses, with the overall focus on leadership and management. Education generally increases in intensity and level of knowledge as individuals progress in rank and assume broader leadership roles. EPME is distinct from the technical training which service members receive for their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), or Navy Rating. Joint The DoD operates a Joint Senior Enlisted Professional Military Education (SEJPME) course designed to integrate members from across all branches of service into a unified force. The SEJPME Course is designed to expose enlisted personnel to joint education and prepare them to succeed by improving their ability to operate effectively as part of a future joint force and supervise multiple Service members. The course is available online as a distance-learning course. Air Force Air Force EPME is created and provided through the Thomas N. Barnes Center for Enlisted Education, part of the Air University system, named after the service's fourth Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Thomas N. Barnes, the first African-American to attain the highest enlisted position in any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. The principal instructional method for all Air Force EPME is guided discussion, in which students share ideas, experiences, and work together to achieve various educational objectives. Formative evaluations are an integral part of the curriculum and serve as feedback tools for the student and instructor. Summative objective and performance evaluations are used to determine whether the educational requirements outlined in the course are met. All EPME courses include fitness and drill and ceremony components as well as formal lectures and academic research projects.

As well as one-on-one and group/topic chat, it also featured cloud- based file storage, video calling, searchable message-history and inline-image viewing. The software was available to download onto computers running Windows, Mac or Linux, as well as Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Since 2014, HipChat used a freemium model, as much of the service was free with some additional features requiring organizations to pay per month. HipChat was launched in 2010 and acquired by Atlassian in 2012. In September 2017, Atlassian replaced the cloud-based HipChat with a new cloud product called Stride, with HipChat continuing on as the client-hosted HipChat Data Center. In July 2018 announcement, Atlassian announced a partnership with Slack under which Slack would acquire the codebase and related IP assets of HipChat and Stride from Atlassian. Following this, HipChat and Stride customers were migrated to the Slack group collaboration platform in a transition that was completed by February 2019.  History  HipChat was founded by Chris Rivers, Garret Heaton, and Pete Curley, who studied together at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and also created HipCal and Plaxo Pulse. They launched the first HipChat beta on December 13, 2009. HipChat was made available to the public starting January 25, 2010. On March 22, 2010, HipChat launched a web chat beta which allowed users to chat via the browser in addition to the existing Windows, Mac and Linux client. HipChat's web client came out of beta and SMS chat support was added on April 16, 2010. On May 12, 2010, HipChat unveiled its official API. HipChat is mainly written in PHP and Python using the Twisted software framework, but uses other third- party services. On July 19, 2010, the team moved into an office in Sunnyvale, California. Co-founder Pete Curley announced that HipChat had secured $100,000 in funding on August 10, 2010. This round of seed funding allowed the company to start advertising and cover operational costs. HipChat launched their iOS app on March 4, 2011 and their Android app on June 2, 2011. On March 7, 2012, Atlassian, which had been using the service internally, announced it had acquired HipChat. On April 24, 2017, HipChat experienced a hacking incident in which user info, messages, and content were accessed. On May 11, 2017, Atlassian announced HipChat Data Center, a self-hosted enterprise chat tool. On September 7, 2017, Atlassian discontinued the cloud-based HipChat, replacing it with HipChat's successor, called Stride, which offers additional features to enhance efficiency of collaboration. The client-hosted HipChat Data Center continues to be supported. =Integration with Slack= On July 26, 2018, Atlassian announced that HipChat and Stride would be discontinued February 15, 2019, and that it had reached a deal to sell their intellectual property to Slack. Slack will pay an undisclosed amount over three years to assume the user bases of the services, and Atlassian will take a minority investment in Slack. The companies also announced a commitment to work on integration of Slack with Atlassian services.  Features  The primary features of HipChat are chat rooms, one-on-one messaging, searchable chat history, image sharing, 5 GB of file storage, and SMS messaging for one-on-one conversations. A premium version adds video calling, screen sharing, unlimited file storage, history retention controls, and a virtual machine version allows HipChat to run within corporate firewalls. A guest access mode allows users outside of the organization to join a group chat via a shareable URL. Inline GIF playback and custom emoticons are also available. The product is available as a mobile client, a web client and a downloadable native application. HipChat Data Center is Atlassian's self-hosted team communication offering. In addition to integration with Atlassian's other products, HipChat integrates with services such as GitHub, MailChimp and Heroku. To allow for more third- party integrations to be added, HipChat features a REST interface with several language-specific implementations. Administrators can access 1-to-1 chat histories if the customer's company policies permit viewing of employee communications.HipChat TOS update, April 25, 2014 See also *List of collaborative software  References   External links  *Official Site Category:Web applications Category:Chat websites Category:Adobe Integrated Runtime platform software Category:Instant messaging Category:Atlassian products Category:Business chat software ","title":"HipChat"},{"id":"27089918","text":"Poecilasthena pulchraria is a moth of the family Geometridae.

Biography Bruce Conte was born in Sanger, and grew up in Fresno, California USA. Conte and his cousin Victor Conte began playing in a 'family' rhythm and blues band as junior high school students in the early 1960s. Throughout high school they performed in the rhythm sections of several local bands, including Common Ground, playing the local club scene in 1967‚Äì69. In 1969 Conte moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and joined The Loading Zone, who shared rehearsal halls with, and regularly opened shows for, Tower of Power. Conte became close to Tower of Power's founder and leader, Emilio Castillo, and to Stephen Kupka‚Äîthe primary song-writers for the group‚Äîand began co-writing songs with them and occasionally sitting in with the band. In 1972, Tower of Power began recording their eponymously titled third album, but at the beginning of the sessions, Castillo decided to change a number of band members and Conte and fellow Loading Zone member Lenny Pickett were invited to join, along with lead vocalist Lenny Williams. Conte remained with Tower Of Power until 1979, performing on the albums Tower of Power, Back To Oakland, Urban Renewal, In The Slot, Ain't Nothin' Stoppin' Us Now, We Came To Play, and the live album Live And In Living Color. Conte also contributed backing vocals, as well as a number of songs to these albums both as sole and co- writer. In an interview with Robb Lawrence, Conte cited as his primary influences Albert King, Grant Green, George Benson and Jimmy Nolen (primarily his work with James Brown). Conte's lead playing is mostly in an expanded blues style often using blues, pentatonic and Dorian mode scales. After leaving Tower of Power in 1979, Conte played in a number of groups in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas, as well as with Al McKay in his All-Stars, and released four solo albums. One of these is Bullet Proof on Severn Records (2002). In 2006 Conte rejoined Tower of Power, touring with the band for 14 months, before moving to Cebu in the Philippines. Back in Los Angeles in 2012, Conte, an insulin-dependent diabetic, announced that a routine blood test in July of that year had revealed that he has leukemia. An appeal to raise funds for his medical treatment was established via the Jeremy Wilson Foundation. Equipment Conte's guitar throughout nearly his entire period with Tower of Power was a 1957 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop. Conte performed primarily using the neck pick-up and played the guitar so much that he wore through the pickup cover. Conte sold the guitar in 2006. During the Tower of Power years, Conte played through a 1967 Fender Super Reverb in the studio, using a Fender Quad Reverb or sometimes Twin Reverb for live work. He also used Vox wah wah and MXR Phase 90 effects pedals. More recently Conte has played a Baker guitar through a Rivera amplifier.

Biography In 1934 Li graduated from the School of Engineering at Beiping University (ÂåóÂπ≥Â§ßÂ≠∏, (different from today's Peking University in Beijing, even though Beiping is the official name for current Beijing in Republic era). In 1937 Li graduated from the School of Engineering at National Central University (now called Nanjing University) in Nanjing, receiving a Bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Li, as Chief Engineer, established the first airplane factory in China ‚Äì the Dading Airplane Factory (Â§ßÂÆöÈ£õÊ©üË£ΩÈÄ†Âª†) in Dading, current Guizhou Province, Southwestern China. Li also led the building of the first Chinese indigenous aircraft engine. Li participated in the examination for the Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program, and obtained the same score as Qian Xuesen. However, there was only one scholarship awardee and Qian published two or three more articles than Li, so Qian was preferred. Nevertheless, Li went to study in the United States and received master and doctor's degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT, Li co-founded the Man-Vehicle Laboratory. Li was also the Director of the MIT innovation center. In 1951, Li collaborated with Charles Stark Draper and published an article on optimal control, which opened a new field of automation. Li founded several companies including Dynisco, Setra Systems (co- founded with his brother S. Y. Lee), and Y.T.Li Engineering. Li is also an inventor and has been granted more than 60 US patents. In 1987 Li was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering for \\"his contributions to innovation in instrumentation, control, and to engineering education'\\". From 1980 to 1984, Li was the President of the Chinese American Association. Li was an important person involved in the peace dialogue between Beijing and Taipei during the 1970s and 1980s. Li delivered Chiang Ching-kuo's personal messages to Deng Xiaoping when Deng was visiting the United States and Hong Kong.

Jeremiah (iii) or Jeremiah ben Abba;JEREMIAH BEN ABBA, Jewish Virtual Library; Article ) was a prominent Jewish Amora sage of the Land of Israel, of the fourth generation of the Amora era (4th century). He is always quoted by the single name \\"Jeremiah,\\" though sometimes that name is used for Jeremiah b. Abba. Biography He was born in Babylonia, and initially was unsuccessful in his studies.Ketuvot 75a He then emigrated to Caesarea, after which he made rapid progress in his studies. Among his teachers in the Land of Israel were Abbahu;Bava Metzia 16b Samuel bar Isaac, whose homilies he very frequently reports;Yerushalmi Peah 1 16b; Yerushalmi Megillah 1 70d; Yerushalmi Hagigah 1 76c and Rabbi Assi;Gittin 44a; Hullin 21a but his principal teacher was his countryman Rav Zeira. Both Zeira and Abbahu loved the young scholar as a son.Moed Kattan 4a; Bava Metziah 16b Ammi employed Jeremiah as tutor to his son.Yerushalmi Beitzah 5 63a Once while Zeira and his pupil were engaged in some halakhic investigation the hour of prayer arrived, and Jeremiah began to betray impatience at being detained. Zeira, noticing it, reproved him with the words, \\"He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination\\".Proverbs 28:9; Shabbat 10a Jeremiah developed such industrious habits as to evoke from his teacher the remark that since the death of Ben Azzai and Ben Zoma, with whom industry ended, there had not been so zealous a student as Jeremiah.Yerushalmi Nedarim 8 40d; compare Sotah 9 15 But in his anxiety to acquire knowledge and accuracy he developed extreme captiousness. He frequently provoked the laughter of the academy, except of his teacher;Niddah 23a and ultimately his ultra-subtleties became insufferable. His considerate preceptor time and again warned him against pursuing his arguments beyond the bounds of halakhah;Rosh Hashana 13a; Sotah 16b but it proved of no avail. At last his colleagues gave vent to their displeasure. The college was seriously discussing a point of law, when Jeremiah broke in with what appeared to be a ridiculous objection, whereupon he was ordered out of the academy.Bava Batra 23b It happened that after the death of the great teachers a legal problem vexed the minds of the scholars, and there was none to solve it. It was submitted to Jeremiah, who returned it with the solution, which he prefaced with the humble words: \\"Although I am not worthy [to be consulted by you], your pupil's opinion inclines this way.\\" On receipt of this, which was taken as an apology for the past, his colleagues reinstated him.Bava Batra 165b Thenceforth Jeremiah was the undisputed head of the scholastic circle at Tiberias,Yerushalmi Shabbat 1 3d, 3 6c; compare ib. 6 8a and questions were addressed to him from different parts of Palestine. Nor was his fame limited by the boundaries of his adopted country. In Babylonia also his opinions carried great weight, and when a contemporary or later Babylonian scholar introduced a statement by the phrase \\"It is said in the West,\\" it was generally assumed that that statement emanated from Jeremiah.Sanhedrin 17b The reverence in which he was held by his former countrymen appears from the following colloquy between his younger contemporaries Abaye and Raba: Said the former: \\"One Palestinian scholar is worth two of ours\\"; whereupon the other remarked: \\"And yet when one of ours emigrates to Palestine he is worth two of the natives. Take, for example, Jeremiah; although while he was here he could not comprehend our teachers, since emigrating to Palestine he has risen to such eminence as to look upon us as 'stupid Babylonians'.\\" Indeed, not only did Jeremiah repeatedly apply this epithet to Babylonian scholars, but he spoke disdainfully of his nativeland as well. Whenever an opinion by a Babylonian scholar met with his disapprobation, he would say: \\"Those Babylonian simpletons! they dwell in a land of darkness and advance opinions of darkness\\".Pesachim 34b; Yoma 57a; Bekhorot 25b Along with the leadership of the scholastic circle, the management of public affairs was entrusted to him. He considered this occupation as paramount to engaging in the study of the Law;Yerushalmi Berachot 5 8d but it sometimes caused him unpleasantness. Once, some serious trouble threatened the Jews of Tiberias, and much treasure was required to avert it. Jeremiah was called upon to assess the people, and in discharging this duty he displeased his older colleague Jacob b. Bun. Jeremiah had called on Jacob for a considerable contribution, whereupon he remarked, \\"Jeremiah is still at his tricks: he deserves excommunication.\\" The feeling between them became so bitter that they excommunicated each other, though they soon revoked their decrees and became reconciled.Yerushalmi Moed Kattan 3 81d Jeremiah had many pupils, among them Rabbi Jonah and Hezekiah II, who became leading scholars of the next generation. He left the following directions for his interment: \\"Clothe me in white garments with sleeves, put stockings and shoes on my feet, place a staff in my hand, and lay me down on my side. Thus equipped, when the Messiah comes I shall be ready to follow him.\\"Yerushalmi Kilaim 9 32b; Yerushalmi Ketuvot 12 35a Teachings His name is frequently found in both halakhah and aggadah, in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, and in the Midrashim.

A native of Australia, he served in the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps in World War I before moving to England and joining the staff of the Hospital for Sick Children at Great Ormond Street. An amateur tennis player in the 1920s, he made four appearances at Wimbledon. He created several medical devices, including the Denis Browne bar and a restraint device used in surgery known as the Denis Browne crucifix. Browne suggested modifications to the surgical or medical treatment of children with several conditions. He devised his own approach to the repair of hypospadias and worked on improvements to the management of other genitourinary, gastrointestinal, orthopaedic and cardiovascular problems. He was the first president of the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons and the association awards the Denis Browne Gold Medal for worldwide excellence. Browne was married to novelist Helen de Guerry Simpson until her death in 1940. A few years later, he married nurse administrator Lady Moyra Ponsonby. He practised at Great Ormond Street until 1957, when he was named emeritus surgeon. He died of a short illness a few years after his retirement and was survived by his second wife and three children. Early life Browne's grandfather, William Stawell, who was Chief Justice of Victoria Born in Melbourne, Browne was the son of Sylvester J. Browne and Anne Catherine Stawell. His maternal grandfather, William Stawell, had come to Australia from Ireland and had become Chief Justice of Victoria. Browne's uncle, Thomas Alexander Browne, was an author with the pseudonym Rolf Boldrewood. Sylvester Browne moved his family to a sheep farm in New South Wales when Denis was nine. A tall, athletic youngster, Browne had been given the middle name Wolko, which was an Aboriginal word for \\"big man\\". Growing up on a sheep farm had given Browne long-lasting interests in shooting and horsemanship. He studied medicine at St. Paul's College in Sydney, where he held the position of Senior Student in 1914. After graduating from medical school, Browne was a captain with the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps during World War I, and he served in Gallipoli with the 13th Light Horse Regiment. He became ill with typhoid fever, necessitating his return to Australia. He later returned to service and was in charge of a field ambulance in France. He later returned to service and was in charge of a field ambulance in France. He moved to the 3rd Australian Auxiliary Hospital in England. He was allowed military leave to spend time with orthopaedic surgeon Sir Robert Jones of the Royal Southern Hospital in Liverpool, leading him to resign his military commission in 1919. He subsequently worked as a physician in Middlesex and London. Career Browne joined the staff of England's Hospital for Sick Children at Great Ormond Street in 1922, and he introduced several devices to enhance the care of children with surgical problems. He introduced a \\"top hat\\" facemask device for the delivery of ether anesthesia to children in 1928. In 1930, Browne created a wooden T-shaped device for the restraint of infants during surgery. A second version of the device, which became known as the Denis Browne crucifix, was padded and made of duralumin. Browne studied and influenced the surgical management of a wide variety of problems, including cleft lip and palate, patent ductus arteriosus, intestinal obstruction and genitourinary problems. He paid special attention to the surgical problems of newborns, and he introduced new thoughts on the development and management of conditions such as club foot and hypospadias. In formulating his version of the hypospadias repair, Browne knew that fistulae lined with epithelium would not close, so he created a fistula between the hypospadias and the similarly lined tip of the penis. He also realised that one of the common steps in such repairs ‚Äì the transfer of skin from the foreskin to the ventral surface of the penis ‚Äì was unnecessary. Denis Browne bar In the correction of club foot, Browne suggested that the feet would respond to bracing. He created a device consisting of a bar and open-toed shoes that would keep the feet joined horizontally at optimal angles of external rotation ‚Äì 20 degrees of external rotation for unaffected feet and as much as 90 degrees for the affected limbs. Nearing the end of his career, Browne expressed frustration that the Denis Browne bar had met with resistance from orthopaedic surgeons and that the device had been modified without his consultation before it was introduced in the US. Often approaching surgical problems with unique thought processes, he was sometimes seen as resistant to the opinions of other physicians. He was said to be very kind, but he could appear aloof, as he did not engage in much conversation. Commenting on Browne's reputation for brash behavior, surgeon E. Durham Smith wrote, \\"He certainly had a prickly personality and a particular venom reserved for orthopaedic surgeons and anatomists, but his achievements may have been possible only by one possessed of such a strong and towering character.\\" Browne was an honorary fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and the International College of Surgeons. He was the first president of the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons (BAPS). He and a few other paediatric surgeons had founded the organization in 1954. Because there were only thought to be 50‚Äì60 paediatric surgeons in the world at that time, BAPS quickly developed an international membership. Personal Browne's father- in-law, Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough As a young doctor, Browne married novelist Helen de Guerry Simpson and they had one daughter, named Clemence after one of Simpson's literary collaborators, Clemence Dane. Simpson died in 1940. For the next few years, Browne lived at Great Ormond Street, and his daughter sometimes came to stay with him. He married Lady Myra Ponsonby in 1945; she was the daughter of Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough. She was a nurse and later became the vice president of the Royal College of Nursing and the superintendent of St. John Ambulance. They had two children together, a son and daughter. His son is the libel barrister Desmond Browne QC, a former Chairman of the Bar of England and Wales. Browne was a skilled amateur tennis player, and he appeared in the first round at Wimbledon each year between 1921 and 1924. His four Wimbledon losses included a singles match against future Japanese Olympian Masanosuke Fukuda and a doubles match where he faced Jacques Brugnon. In his room at Great Ormond Street, he painted a line at the level of a tennis net so that he could practise his shots. Browne enjoyed making modifications to common objects for his personal use. He created a round tennis racquet that he felt was superior to the traditional oval, and he was known to modify his own guns. When he was at Great Ormond Street, Browne created a universal golf club with an adjustable angle of lift. A resident at the hospital recalled that when Browne demonstrated the golf club, he drove a golf ball with such force that it broke a window at the nearby homeopathic hospital. Later life During Browne's tenure as surgeon-in-chief at Great Ormond Street, a number of distinguished physicians practiced there, including cardiac surgeon David Waterston and urologists David Innes Williams and Barry O'Donnell. In 1957, Browne was named an emeritus surgeon. Four years later, he was made Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) and Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Browne developed a brief illness and died at his London home on 9 January 1967. The year after Browne's death, the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons established the first annual Denis Browne Gold Medal for outstanding worldwide contributions to the field.

Education He has received a Master of Fine Arts degree in painting at Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia in 2006 and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting at Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He currently lives in Houston, TX. Career McGrath‚Äôs work responds to consumer media culture and the historical use of Christian icons in colonial Latin America. As a painter, growing up in Puerto Rico, one of the oldest colonies in the world and at the same time one of the countries with most cars per square mile, he explores the relationship between traditional icons and the modern-day consumer society. The paintings project a world filled with unexpected anachronisms where spirituality is transgressed by triviality. Religious symbols lose their original meaning and are amorally converted into disposable marketplace products from the media culture. This recontextualization of the \\"retablo\\" altarpiece painting imported from the Old World in colonial times allows him to question today's assumptions about the demise of colonialism. By utilizing the \\"retablo\\" format, Patrick McGrath can emulate previous indoctrination strategies and question the imported set of values from the corporate global economy. The \\"retablos\\" act then as purveyors of the belief system intrinsic to a capitalist society, which, assuming control over the media, diffuses the pervasive corporate propaganda and manufactures mass consent with its offers of salvation. While these religious icons lose their aura of sanctity displaced by some product or celebrity, these in turn seem to gain a pseudo-religious position. In some of his paintings, the cult to TV celebrities and movie stars pretends to take over every possible space, reaching a ubiquitously self-centered divinity status. Many of the \\"retablos\\" that he has created are paintings distributed in three united plates. These triptychs operate as history books meant to be read carefully 'between the lines'. The lines in this case are the constant commercial interruptions implicit in the message. The work intends to pronounce a commentary about how the neoliberal globalization, with its consumerist doctrines, transmitted by the media, have altered dramatically the way we understand religion, live, and relate to each other and our environment. Through a redefinition of our cultural identity and establishing a dialogue with history, Patrick McGrath intends to confront the intolerable historic amnesia that affects us all.

The painting records British colonial life in the Indian court of Asaf-Ud-Dowlah. The painting is part of the Tate Gallery collection. The painting was completed in February 1788, four years after the event it records. A recent cleaning has revealed the original colours and made more apparent what appears to be an erection visible on the Nawab of Oudh, the central figure. History Johann Zoffany was a German-born painter who had become a successful portrait painter in London. Among his principal patrons were the royal family. Queen Charlotte had sent Zoffany to Florence where he had agreed to paint the Tribuna of the Uffizi. The agreed price was high and he was paid ¬£300 a year.Tribuna of the Uffizi, Royal Collection, accessed April 2010 Zoffany stayed seven years. On his return, he brought for Queen Charlotte the painting of The Tribuna of the Uffizi that included within the body of the Uffizi a number of British residents in Florence. The painting received a cool reception because it included people who were not considered appropriate or desirable. Against advice, Zoffany had included people such as Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet, British consul at Florence, and the painter Thomas Patch. Patch had been expelled from Rome for a homosexual act; at this time homosexuality was illegal in the eyes of both the church and the state. One figure who was thought acceptable was George Nassau Clavering-Cowper, 3rd Earl Cowper, who is shown on the left of the painting contemplating the aesthetic virtues of the Niccolini-Cowper Madonna - which Zoffany eventually sold to him. A watercolour which is thought to also show this cock fight, painted about 1830.Asif ud-Daulah, Columbia.edu, accessed April 2010 Zoffany had to leave the country as all of his usual commissions were no longer forthcoming. He never again got a royal commission. He had hoped to sail with Captain Cook, but as a second choice he elected to make the long journey to Lucknow. His fellow painter, Ozias Humphrey, was already painting portraits of the wealthy employees of the British East India Company and of Indian princes. He may have told Zoffany of the opportunities available in Lucknow. In Lucknow, Zoffany met the main players at the court. The nominal head of the State of Oudh was Asaf-Ud-Dowlah, although the governor Warren Hastings was the British representative. He commanded the power of the British East India Company, and it was Hastings who commissioned the painting of the cockmatch by Zoffany.Indian Life and Landscapes by Western Artists , Pauline Rohatgi et al., Chapter 4, accessed April 2010. In time, Hastings was summoned back to England to face charges of corruption laid by Edmund Burke which took years to dismiss. Versions The Ashwick version - the original is lost There are at least two different versions of the painting of the cock match. The two attributed to Zoffany are the Daylesford version (above) and the Ashwick version. Both are clearly the same composition but the Daylesford version contains many more background figures and subtle variations. Different people are included and they are arranged in subtly different ways. The Daylesford painting was sent back to England when it was complete. There is a story that the painting was lost at sea and recreated later by Zoffany but that is not now thought to be true. However there are other studies of the same subject. About 1790 a key was published which identifies many people in the painting.Key to the painting There is an engraving by Richard Earlom which is of the Daylesford version. Less well known is a painting from the Indian court which seems to show the same subject matter. People in the painting(s) Both of Zoffany's versions of the painting show at their centre Asaf-Ud- Dowlah, the Nawab. This man was held in very low regard, but he was the nominal head of state. His favourites included Colonel John Mordaunt and Claude Martin. Mordaunt was the illegitimate and nearly illiterate son of the Earl of Peterborough. He had managed to be assigned to Warren Hastings and through him he was appointed head of security. His real role however included organising entertainments.John Zoffany, R.A. His Life and Works : 1735-1810, accessed April 2010 Mordaunt and his employer were said to have shown the same low tastes in entertainment. Even at that time, cockfighting was not well regarded in British society. Mordaunt had arranged for British birds to be brought to India, where he used them to take on local cockerels. Claude Martin was a Frenchman who had switched sides to the British. Clever and skilful, Martin is shown on the right sitting on a couch. Martin's contemporaries shown in both versions of the painting include the Frenchman Antoine Polier. Polier made his fortune in Lucknow which he eventually took back to France. He was unlucky enough to arrive in the middle of the French Revolution and he was stabbed to death at Poitiers for being a noble. Wombwell (on the right) was the local paymaster. Zoffany is included in the painting, as is Ozias Humphrey, although in the Ashwick version Zoffany is more surreptitious and the figure of Humphrey has been thought to be a Lieutenant Humphrey. Both versions include a scene where a young Moslem boy is being publicly embraced by a Hindu man. A nearby spectator appears to be held back from expressing his indignation. Another detail is the sexual arousal of Asaf-Ud-Dowlah. This detail is said to be more obvious now that the painting has been cleaned. Some say this may be Warren Hastings' joke to show the Nawab of Awadh in this way. His homosexuality is well recorded. His favourite, Hassan Raza Khan, is the figure in the red turban who is at the centre of the scene. He is said to have hundreds of wives whom he ignored and he died without children. Claude Martin, in a letter to Ozias Humphrey, made an interesting observation on Colonel Mordaunt's role: > Colonel Mordaunt is now at the vizier's court, hunting, fighting cocks and > doing all he can to please the Nabob in the expectation of being paid the > large sums due to him by the Prince... although the Prince has dark and > sinister intentions, but I fear much of his success, as the vizier is not > much willing to pay his debts particularly to Europeans for what I know of > his character I think it such that if one could read in his heart then one > would perceive it loaded with many dark and sinister intentions and as you > know those that compose his court you then ought to know what man he is.

The tool implements the Test Template Framework (TTF) proposed by Phil Stocks and David Carrington in . Usage Fastest presents a command-line user interface. The user first needs to load a Z specification written in LaTeX format verifying the ISO standard . Then, the user has to enter a list of the operations to test as well as the testing tactics to apply to each of them. In a third step Fastest generates the testing tree of each operation. After testing trees have been generated, users can browse them and their test classes, and, more importantly, they can prune any test class both automatically or manually. Once testing trees have been pruned, users can instruct Fastest to find one abstract test case for each leaf in each testing tree. Testing tactics supported by Fastest Currently, Fastest supports the following testing tactics: *Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF). It is the only testing tactic applied by default (regardless of whether the user has added or not other testing tactics) and the first one to be applied. *Standard partitions (SP). The user can add, modify and delete standard partitions for any predefined Z mathematical operator by simply editing a text file . *Free Types (FT) *In Set Extension (ISE) *Proper Subset of Set Extension (PSSE) *Subset of Set Extension (SSE) Pruning testing trees in Fastest Fastest provides two ways of pruning testing trees : *Automatic pruning. :To prune a testing tree, Fastest analyzes the predicate of each leaf to determine if the predicate is a contradiction or not. Since this problem is undecidable, the tool implements a best-effort algorithm that can be improved by users. The most important aspect of the algorithm is a library of so called elimination theorems each of which represents a family of contradictions. This library can be extended by users by simply editing a text file. Elimination theorems are conjunctions of parametric Z atomic predicates. *Manual pruning. :Fastest users can prune subtrees or individual leaves of testing trees by issuing two commands. These commands will prune all the test classes in the subtree regardless of them being empty or not. The main purpose of these commands is to allow engineers to reduce the number of or to eliminate unimportant test cases. How Fastest finds abstract test cases The tool finds abstract test cases by calculating a finite model for each leaf in a testing tree . Finite models are calculated by restricting the type of each VIS variable to a finite set and then by calculating the Cartesian product between these sets. Each leaf predicate is evaluated on each element of this Cartesian product until one satisfies the predicate (meaning that an abstract test case was found) or until it is exhausted (meaning that either the test class is unsatisfiable or the finite model is inadequate). In the last case, the user has the chance to assist the tool in finding the right finite model or to prune the test class because it is unsatisfiable. Architecture and technology Fastest is a Java application based on the Community Z Tools (CZT) project. The tool can be used in one of two modes : *In distributed mode Fastest works as a client-server application. The application can be installed in a number of computers each acting as client, a server or both. Users access the application through clients which send test classes to servers (called testing servers) which try to find an abstract test case out of them. In this way the heaviest task is distributed across as many computers as possible. Since the calculation of an abstract test case from a test class is completely independent from each other, this architecture speeds up the entire process proportionally with respect to the number of testing servers. *In application mode each instance of Fastest is completely independent of each other. All the tasks are computed in the local computer. =Adding new testing tactics= As can be seen from the TTF presentation, testing tactics are essential to the method. They are the tools that engineers must use to create the most discovering test cases possible. Then, the more sound testing tactics available to engineers the better. In Fastest users can add testing tactics of their own by implementing the Tactic interface provided by the tool. This interface has methods to configure and apply testing tactics. The interface definition is the following: package client.blogic.testing.ttree.tactics; import java.util.*; import net.sourceforge.czt.z.ast.Spec; import common.z.TClass; import common.z.OpScheme; /*Interface that abstracts a testing tactic (needed to generate test trees) and * makes possible its application to a test class in order to generate new ones. */ public interface Tactic { /*Applies this tactic to the specified test class and returns the list with * the generated test classes. * @param tClass * @return */ public List applyTactic(TClass tClass); /*Sets the specification of the system under test. * @param opScheme */ public void setSpec(Spec spec); /*Gets the Z schema box of the operation under test. * @return */ public Spec getSpec(); /*Sets the Z schema box of the operation under test. * @param opScheme */ public void setOriginalOp(OpScheme opScheme); /*Gets the Z schema box of the operation under test. * @return */ public OpScheme getOriginalOp(); /*Parses the parameters of this tactic. * @param str * @return */ public boolean parseArgs(String str); /*Sets the instance of TacticInfo associated to this object. * @param tacticInfo */ public void setTacticInfo(TacticInfo tacticInfo); /*Gets the instance of TacticInfo associated to this object. * @return */ public TacticInfo getTacticInfo(); /*Gets the description of this tactic. * @return the string with the description of this tactic. */ public String getDescription(); /*Sets the description of this tactic. * @param description */ public void setDescription(String description); } See also *Test Template Framework *Model-based testing Notes References * *. *. * Category:Software testing tools Category:Formal methods tools Category:Z notation Category:Articles with example Java code ","title":"Fastest"},{"id":"27090360","text":"Gary O'Kane (born 23 January 1970 in Dunloy, County Antrim, Northern Ireland) is an Irish retired sportsperson.

Getter√∂n Nature Reserve (Swedish: Getter√∂ns naturreservat) is a nature reserve at Getter√∂n in Varberg Municipality, Sweden. It consists of parts of the peninsula Getter√∂n and an area to the north. It has an area of 350 hectares, of which 235 are land. The reserve was established in 1970. Getter√∂n Nature Reserve is protected as a Natura 2000 site and included in the Ramsar list. Getter√∂n Nature Reserve is one of northern Europe's premier birdwatching sites. In the reserve's wetland nesting species like gadwall, garganey, black- tailed godwit, ruff, dunlin, little tern, and pied avocet. The pied avocet also serves as a symbol for the nature reserve. Also in the winters there are many different species at Getter√∂n, for example little grebe, water rail, common kingfisher, Eurasian bittern, bearded reedling, whooper swan, and smew. Also birds of prey, like the peregrine falcon, are common.  History  The wetlands at Getter√∂n were created in the 1930s, when the shallow strait between the mainland and Getter√∂n was filled out. Two bays were created, one on each side of the artificial isthmus. In the southern bay, the Port of Varberg is located. In the northern bay, where the stream Himle√•n flows into the Kattegat, dredged material from the harbor was dumped, which made the bay smaller and shallower. This meant that the wetlands were formed. Soon, many bird species were nesting here, and the birdwatchers flocked to. Slowly, the bay became smaller, thereby undermining the quality of the wetland as a bird area. In the 1990s there was a restoration of the area, and areas with reeds were replaced with open water and shore meadows. A pond with several small islands where the birds can nest was constructed.  Activity  There is an information center at the nature reserve, with a caf√© and toilets. There is also an exhibition about the nature reserve, and spotting scopes through which the visitors can look out over the nature reserve. There are also temporary art and photography exhibitions in the building.

China and Russia abstained from voting on Resolution 1067, which was approved by the other 13 members of the Council.

The Security Council recalled the sovereignty that all countries had in the airspace above their territory and territorial waters. In this regard, all countries had to abide by principles, rules and standards in the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), including rules relating to the interception and non-use of weapons against civil aircraft. The resolution noted that the shooting down of the two planes, which were part of the Brothers to the Rescue organisation run by Cuban exiles, was a violation of the principle that no weapons were to be used against civil aircraft in flight and that, when intercepting such aircraft, the lives of those on board not should be jeopardised. Cuba had argued that the flights were provocative acts in its airspace. Condolences were expressed to the families of the four persons who died as a result of the interception, which was condemned by the Council. All the parties were called to respect international civil aviation laws and procedure, while at the same time reaffirming the right of states to use appropriate measures against aircraft being used for purposes contrary to that of the Chicago Convention. All states that had not yet ratified the Chicago Convention were urged to do so, while the decision of the ICAO to investigate standards and practices to avoid a similar incident in the future was welcomed.

The Northwest Airlines 727 had been chartered to pick up the Baltimore Colts professional football team in Buffalo in western New York. All three crew members on board died when the aircraft struck the ground following a stall and rapid descent caused by the crew's reaction to erroneous airspeed readings caused by atmospheric icing. The icing occurred due to failure to turn on the pitot tube heating at the start of the flight. This was one of two Boeing 727s to crash in the United States that day; the other was TWA Flight 514 in northern Virginia, northwest of Dulles airport. Accident The flight was chartered to pick up the Baltimore Colts in Buffalo after the aircraft originally earmarked to transport the team was grounded by a snowstorm in Detroit. The Boeing 727-251, registration N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a ferry flight to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past , the overspeed warning horn sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a stick shaker stall warning. The aircraft leveled at until it started to descend out of control in a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g. At about , a large portion of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer separated due to the high G-forces, making recovery impossible. Flight 6231 struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26. The aircraft had descended from altitude to ground level at above sea level in 83 seconds. The crash occurred about west of Thiells, New York. Police described the crash site as a heavily wooded marshy area and accessibility was hampered by winter weather conditions including wind and a rain-snow mix. Despite the 727's full load of fuel, there was no explosion or fire when the plane hit the ground, and there was no post-crash fire, although police described the crash site having a \\"strong smell of jet fuel.\\" Crew The aircraft had three crewmembers on board. Captain John B. Lagorio, age 35, had worked for Northwest for almost nine years. He had just under 7,500 flying hours flying experience, with just under 2,000 hours total time flying the Boeing 727. The first officer, Walter A. Zadra, 32, had been working for Northwest for almost seven years. He had about 4,700 hours flying experience, of which two thirds was as a second officer (flight engineer). His Boeing 727 experience amounted to about 1,250 hours, but only 46 of that was as a pilot ‚Äì the other 1,200 hours experience was as a flight engineer. The second officer, James F. Cox, 33, had been with the airline for almost six years and had 1,600 hours experience as a Boeing 727 Flight Engineer. Investigation An example of a pitot head The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) led the accident investigation and released its final report on August 13, 1975. Investigators found that the flightcrew had not activated the pitot head heaters and the pitot tubes had become blocked with ice which caused the crew to receive incorrect airspeed readings. The crew, believing the readings were true, pulled back on the control column and raised the nose, which caused the aircraft to stall. From the NTSB report's abstract: > ...the probable cause of this accident was the loss of control of the > aircraft because the flightcrew failed to recognize and correct the > aircraft's high angle of attack, low-speed stall and its descending spiral. > The stall was precipitated by the flightcrew's improper reaction to > erroneous airspeed and Mach indications which had resulted from a blockage > of the pitot heads by atmospheric icing. When investigators analysed the 727's voice recorder, the recording revealed that the pilots believed that the shaking of the stick shaker mechanism was caused by the airliner reaching the speed of sound, and not a warning that it was going into a stall.

He was the last king of Ava who was able to hold on to the increasingly fractious kingdom in its entirety. Soon after succeeding his father Narapati, the new king had to put down a rebellion in Toungoo (Taungoo) in 1470, and suppressed an insurrection by his brother the lord of Prome (Pyay), whom the king pardoned. He gained submission of the eastern Shan state of Yawnghwe, and quelled a potential rebellion in the northern Shan states of Mohnyin and Mogaung. He was succeeded by his son Minkhaung II. Early life Thihathura was born in 1431 to Viceroy Narapati of Prome and his chief wife Atula Thiri Maha Dhamma Yaza Dewi, a descendant of Pinya royalty. Thihathura was the eldest of eight children by the couple; he had five younger full sisters and two full brothers Mingyi Swa and Thado Minsaw.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 82‚Äì84 Not yet twelve, the young prince was made heir apparent when his father ascended to the Ava throne in January 1442 (Tabodwe 804 ME).Hmannan Vol. 2: 85 Accession Thihathura ascended to the Ava throne in July 1468 after his father King Narapati died in Prome, having fled from an assassination attempt by one of Thihathura's sons a year earlier. The middle son of Thihathura had stabbed his grandfather the king because the king had disapproved of the young prince's wish to marry his first cousin, daughter of Princess of Sagaing, Thihathura's eldest sister.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 97‚Äì99 Thihathura did not punish the son, and instead allowed him to marry the girl for whom he had stabbed his grandfather, and gave the towns of Sakut, Salin, Baunglin, Legaing, Myo-htit, Taungta, Mindon, Thayet, Myede, Kanyin, and Myaung. He made his elder son, Minkhaung II, crown prince and gave Dabayin as an appanage. The youngest son Minye Kyawswa was given Yamethin to govern.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 100 Reign The queen dowager Atula Thiri was shocked by her son's decision not to punish his son for stabbing his grandfather, and instigated Toungoo to revolt.Harvey 1925: 100‚Äì101 Toungoo, a remote province in the southeastern part of Ava Kingdom, had a long history of insurrections. Its last rebellion lasted seven years (1451‚Äì1458).Fernquest 2006: 62‚Äì66 Toungoo called in help from Hanthawaddy Pegu. Thihathura dispatched an army under Gen. Sithu Kyawhtin, who was accompanied by two of his sons. The governor of Toungoo resisted with the help of Pegu but was defeated in 1470. The princes spared the rebellious governor's life, and carried him off to Ava, leaving Sithu Kyawhtin as the head of the troublesome province.Phayre 1967: 92 Next, the king sent an army to gain submission of Prome, and pardoned his brother Mingyi Swa who was lord there. In 1475 the king with help from the Shan State of Hsipaw (Thibaw) raided Yawnghwe (Nyaungshwe), securing its submission. In early 1476 (837 ME), he sent an expedition against Hanthawaddy, and raided Kawlia near Hlaing. In 1476, Sithu Kyawhtin, lord of Toungoo, enlarged his town. The ministers perceived that this meant Toungoo was about to revolt but the king showed them they were wrong by telling him to let himself be dragged by the hair to court; he did so, saying \\"It is my king‚Äôs command\\". He turned his attention to the Shan states of Mohnyin and Mogaung in the north which had not openly revolted but not explicitly submitted to the new king either. In 1472, he asked China to honor its 1454 recognition of the Shan states as Burmese. China warned not to obstruct the trade route from Yunnan to Burma but would not reaffirm its previous recognition. Ava had to wait until its affairs in the south sorted out. In late 1476 (838 ME), Thiahthura personally led a large-scale expedition to Mohnyin and Mogaung. The king sailed up the Irrawaddy river with 7000 troops and his youngest son Minye Kyawswa of Yamethin marched by land with another 7000 troops, 300 elephants and 6000 horses. Only then did the rulers of the region submit in advance of the king's armies.Fernquest 2005: 299 Thihathura sent envoys to Ceylon in 1474. The envoys brought a broom made of the hair of the king and queen, and its handle studded with gems to sweep the floor of the Temple of the Tooth at Kandy. Death Thihathura died c. August 1480 at age 49 (50th year).The two main standard Burmese chronicles differ on the death year. (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 354): Maha Yazawin says he died in 1482 at age 53 (54th year) while the later chronicle Hmannan Yazawin says 1480 at age 49 (50th year). (Harvey 1925: 101‚Äì102) gives 1481. Based on Hmannan's reporting, he died soon after July 1480 since (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 110) says he had reigned for 12 years.

It was to have been operated by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, and was intended to demonstrate technology for future spacecraft. The satellite had a mass of , and was expected to operate for at least two years. STSAT-2B was originally intended to operate alongside a second spacecraft, STSAT-2A; however STSAT-2A was lost in 2009 after the payload fairing of its carrier rocket failed to separate, leaving the rocket unable to achieve orbit. Instruments The primary instrument aboard STSAT-2B was the Dual-channel Radiometer for Earth and Atmosphere Monitoring, or DREAM, which would have measured the brightness temperature of the Earth at 23.8 GHz and 37 GHz.Dual-channel radiometers for Earth and atmosphere monitoring (DREAM) on micro satellite STSAT-2 The secondary payload, the Laser Retroreflector Array or LRA was to have been used for the Satellite Laser Ranging experiment, which was intended to determine the parameters of the satellite's orbit with a greater degree of precision. Data collected by the secondary payload would have been used to calibrate DREAM, to conduct geodetic research, and to evaluate the performance of the carrier rocket. Due to lower manufacturing tolerance, the retroreflectors on STSAT-2B would have provided greater precision than those intended on STSAT-2A. A series of technological experiments were also to have been conducted; investigating attitude control systems, and testing pulsed plasma thrusters, star trackers, a Sun sensor, as well as an experimental onboard computer, and data relay at rates of up to 10 megabits per second. Launch STSAT-2B was launched by a Naro-1 rocket, flying from the Naro Space Centre. The launch was the second flight of the Naro-1, which consisted of a modified Angara first stage manufactured by Khrunichev, and a South Korean solid-fuelled upper stage. The previous Naro-1 launch was that of STSAT-2A, which occurred in August 2009 and ended in failure. The launch was initially scheduled to occur on 9 June 2010, during a two-hour launch window opening at 07:30 UTC (16:30 local time). Further launch attempts were available at the same time each day until 19 June 2010. The launch attempt on 9 June 2010 was scrubbed after the launch pad's fire suppression system activated for no apparent reason. Following the scrub, the launch was rescheduled for the next day, and took place at 08:01 UTC (17:01 local time) on 10 June 2010. During the first stage burn, around 137 seconds into the flight, contact with the rocket was lost. South Korean science minister Ahn Byung-man later told reporters that the rocket was believed to have exploded. If the launch had been successful, STSAT-2B would have been deployed into an orbit with a perigee of approximately , an apogee of approximately , and around 80 degrees of inclination.

Discovery  The volcano was discovered in 1970 when the French oil company Elf Aquitaine was doing test drills in the Wadden Sea, hoping to find a gas field that a seismic survey had indicated. To their surprise they hit volcanic rock beneath the reservoir rock, which turned out to be an extinct volcano. The gas field went in production in 1988 and is still producing gas. Another clue indicating the presence of the volcano was the temperature. While the usual temperature at that depth is about , they found .  Volcano  The volcano has a height of approximately and a circumference of several kilometers /miles. The volcano was formed about 160 million years ago, during a time of orogenesis on the European continent. The eruptions were short and severe with heavy explosions. This, along with the mineral composition, points to volcanic activity as a result of subduction far away from the volcano. During the Cimmerian Orogeny, the Cimmerian Plate collided with Kazakhstania, sending shock waves through the Eurasian Plate, resulting in volcanism. The volcano is covered by layers of sandstone from the early Cretaceous that act as reservoir rock for the gas. The seal rock consists of shale. The volcanic rock is magnetic, creating a magnetic anomaly.

The current music director and conductor is Mark Russell Smith. Established in 1916, the orchestra has a full season, performing six Masterworks series concerts, three pops concerts, and five signature series chamber concerts. The 96-member orchestra principally performs at two venues: the Adler Theater, located in Davenport, Iowa and Centennial Hall on the campus of Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois. The Riverfront Pops Concert in early September is held at the W.D. Petersen Memorial Music Pavilion in LeClaire Park on the Davenport riverfront. Its Holiday Pops Concert is performed at the Adler Theater. The signature series concerts are held in a more intimate setting, often in Augustana's Wallenberg Hall. It also maintains five ensembles for local youth and conducts extensive outreach in area schools. History =Tri-City Symphony Orchestra= Burtis Opera House (on the left) hosted the first concerts. The orchestra began at a meeting of musicians and citizens from Davenport, Rock Island and Moline on February 10, 1916. They hired Ludwig Becker of Chicago as the first music director. The first name for the orchestra was the Tri-City Symphony. The Tri-Cities, as the area was then called, was the smallest community in the United States to support a full symphony orchestra. The first rehearsal for the orchestra was held on March 12, 1916, and its first concert was held on March 29. The orchestra was composed of 60 amateur and professional musicians from the Tri-Cities. The first performance was held before an audience of 1,200 people at the orchestra's first home, the Burtis Opera House, a vaudeville theater in Davenport. The program included: Wagner's Prelude to Die Meistersinger von Nuremberg; the Wagnerian aria Dich Theure Halle sung by contralto Esther Plumb; Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (Unfinished); Camille Saint-Sa√´ns‚Äô Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, featuring pianist Robert MacDonald; and a few shorter pieces, including a string Orchestra elegy, a waltz, and Tchaikovsky's Marche Slav, The orchestra's first pops concert was held on May 6, 1917, at the Davenport Coliseum. While the orchestra was popular among the citizens of the community, it struggled financially. At first, many of the musicians were not paid, although members of the local musicians union were paid a nominal fee. Because donations fluctuated the number of concerts the orchestra performed fluctuated. Some seasons the orchestra performed eight concerts and during other seasons they had as few as three. Because of the economy during World War I, the 1918‚Äì19 season was cancelled. The symphony struggled to set prices that would attract audiences while at the same time enable it to cover its costs. In some cases the prices were so low that sold- out programs lost money. =Great Depression= Centennial Hall The former Masonic Temple in Davenport The orchestra survived until the Great Depression. The musicians union insisted that their members receive payment, but the symphony could not afford to pay. By 1933 it was out of money. Most of the union musicians left the orchestra and were replaced by amateurs. Unable to perform its more traditional, complex programs, the orchestra offered free tickets for the 1933‚Äì34 season, except for a few seats that were sold for a quarter. Frank Kendrie, the new music director, was paid a $100 per concert. In 1934 orchestra board member Elsie von Maur suggested they charge what the concerts were worth and return to hiring well-known guest artists. The changes worked. The orchestra started to make money, and was able to hire professional musicians again. The Junior Board was established in 1936 to sponsor fundraising projects. In 1940 Elsie von Maur became the symphony's first manager, a position she held for 47 years. Von Maur began the practice of the orchestra's playing the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" on December 7, 1941, at the concert after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. The tradition of not applauding after the national anthem dates from that same concert, when the audience's stunned silence followed the anthem. During World War II, students filled the chairs of musicians who had joined the military. Unlike during the previous war, attendance at the concerts remained high, and the orchestra added concerts in 1944. =After World War II= The symphony made its national broadcast premiere with a live concert on NBC radio's Orchestras of the Nation on January 31, 1948. Later Augustana College's radio station (WVIK) started to broadcast the orchestra's masterworks concerts the week after the performance. The symphony continued to grow in the 1950s. Concerts were moved to Centennial Hall at Augustana College. In the 1960s concerts were held at the Masonic Temple in Davenport as well. In 1976 they hired Lance Willett as the first executive director. =Quad City Symphony Orchestra= Former logo In the 1980s, the orchestra relocated its performances to the Adler Theater, the former RKO Orpheum in Davenport, which was renovated. At the same time, the orchestra changed its name to the Quad City Symphony to better reflect the area. On October 10, 1996, the symphony premiered Lalo Schifrin's Rhapsody for Bix, a tribute to Davenport native and jazz great Bix Beiderbecke. Schifrin conducted the orchestra. On July 3, 2010, the symphony participated in the Quad Cities Independence Day celebration, \\"Red, White and Boom!\\", for the first time. They played a 60-minute pops concert in Davenport's LeClaire Park. Youth Ensembles Adler Theatre The is Quad City Youth Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1958 and is the is the premiere youth orchestra in the region that trains musicians in middle, junior high and high schools. It is open to musicians from 22 school districts. The 96 musicians perform concerts in the autumn and the spring, as well as the annual Symphony Day, which is a series of education concerts for elementary school students. The Youth Philharmonic Orchestra is another Youth Ensemble Group and is an intermediate full orchestra in which members can gain experience playing with other instrument groups. Other groups in the Quad City Youth Ensembles include the Youth String Ensemble for string players who are not ready to play the full orchestral repertoire of the symphony, the Prelude Strings an introductory group for students playing the violin, viola or bass, and the Youth Choir an introductory group for singers in the Quad Cities region. All ensembles preform at annual Fall and Winter Concerts along with the Quad City Symphony Orchestra during the Side-By-Side Concert. https://qcso.org/education/youth- ensembles/ensembles/ Volunteers for Symphony In 1936 the Junior Board was begun to sponsor fundraising projects for the symphony. In 1957 the Tri-City Symphony Auxiliary was formed as another support for it. The group was renamed the Guild of the Quad City Symphony Orchestra after the change of names. Both organizations merged to form Volunteers for Symphony in 1996.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 as Calvary Baptist Church/First Baptist Church. It is affiliated with American Baptist Churches USA. History In 1839 First Baptist Church organized and held its first service in the home of John M. Eldridge on Brady Street. The Rev. Israel Fisher was its first pastor. The charter members were: J. M. Eldridge, Mary Eldridge, John Swartout, Charles Swartout, Mr. and Mrs. Richard Price and Mr. and Mrs. David Wilson. Richard Price and David Wilson were the church's first deacons. Baptists then occupied a series of buildings in the city. They moved into a room over a store on Front Street, now River Drive. Services were held there until the congregation built a brick structure at the corner of Fourth and Brady Streets on a lot donated by Antoine LeClaire. The congregation met there until they moved into a new building on the corner of Sixth and Main Streets. They sold the Brady Street location to St. Luke's Episcopal Church. In October 1851 sixteen persons who had taken letters from the First Baptist Church met in a schoolhouse on Perry Street to organize Second Baptist Church. The first officers of the church were Dr. J. M. Witherwax, C. G. Blood, W. M. Crosson, Levi Davis and J. Solomon. First Baptist Church from the southeast The Second Baptist congregation purchased a house on the northwest corner of Fourth and Perry Streets and held services there. In 1852 they sold this lot and bought one on the southwest corner of Fourth and Perry. A short time later they moved to Third and Brady Streets into a place called the Medical College. That same year the Rev. E.M. Mills joined the community as its pastor. He stayed for five years, and toward the end of his pastorate, they built a church building at the corner of Fourth and Perry Streets. Second Baptist incurred considerable debt in building its new building. Soon after the building was completed both First and Second Baptist were joined. In 1864 the Rev. D.S. Watson became the pastor, the debt was canceled, and the church was renamed Calvary Regular Baptist Church. On May 6, 1886, under the pastorate of the Rev. Frank L. Wilkins, D.D. the congregation decided to build a new church building on the corner of Perry and Fourteenth Streets. The property for the new church was acquired for $3,400. Chicago architect John S. Woolacott designed the structure that was built by John Whittaker. with The cornerstone for the new building was laid on September 21, 1889, and it was dedicated on Sunday, May 25, 1890. The total cost of the building and its furnishing was $33,000. That price included a pipe organ, which cost $3,100. In 1968 the congregation reverted to the name First Baptist Church. Architecture First Baptist is a late 19th-century interpretation of the Romanesque style inspired by Henry Hobson Richardson known as Richardsonian Romanesque. It combines late Victorian polychrome surface areas with a shingle-style roofline treatment. The sanctuary is nearly square in plan and features a very high hipped roof with blind dormers, corner pavilions, and a three-stage tower. The structure was built of red brick and rough stone. It incorporates wide, rounded arch windows in its massive form. They are accompanied by smaller rectangular windows that are grouped in twos and threes. Period stained glass fills the window openings. The corner tower originally had a spire on top. It was removed in the 1950s after it was damaged in a storm. A classroom wing is attached to the sanctuary.

In the Bills 3-4 defensive scheme, he moved from defensive end to inside linebacker, which is an unusual position change considering most defensive ends move to outside linebacker in 3-4 defensive schemes. After several weeks of failing to generate a consistent pass rush, Bills head coach Chan Gailey decided to move Moats to his more natural position of outside linebacker to utilize his pass rushing skill set. In a Week 13 contest of the 2010 season, Moats delivered a hit on Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre that aggravated the quarterback's shoulder injury. It was Moats' hit that eventually led to Favre's consecutive starts streak ending at 297 when he did not play against the New York Giants the following week. Moats' personal catch phrase, 'Don't Cross The Moats', was created by Joe Zogaib. Since then, it has a become a popular trending topic on Twitter, and Moats himself even tattooed the phrase across his upper back. In December 2013, Moats was named the team's Walter Payton Man of the Year for 2013. Moats earned this honor through his work with the United Way of Buffalo and Erie County and other local groups.

The stream flows through the town of Goslar.  Geography  The Abzucht rises in the upper Winter valley (Wintertal) as the Wintertalbach at an elevation of NN. Its source lies on the northeast flank of the Schalke. From here the stream flows initially in a northeasterly direction. West of the Rammelsberg the Abzucht is impounded by the Herzberger Teich. Below this pond the canalised stream passes through the area of the Rammelsberg Mine and reaches the southern edge of the town of Goslar. Here it is joined by the Gose from the left before the Abzucht swings towards the east. After running through the Old Town (Altstadt) of Goslar it continues on, accompanied by the B 498 federal road to Goslar-Oker where it discharges into the Oker from the left at an elevation of . Along its long course the Abzucht descends a total of , which represents an average incline of 15.5 ‚Ä∞. The stream drains a catchment area of before its waters pass down the Oker, Aller and Weser to the North Sea.  History  While the water of the Gose can be used for brewing (Gose Beer), the Abzucht was heavily polluted by mining on the Rammelsberg. The name is derived from the word Abziehen i.e. 'flushing' or 'removing' the contaminated waters of the smelting works.Adelung, Grammatisch-kritisches W√∂rterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart, Band 1. Leipzig 1793, p. 141 In the area of the Winter valley and the Rammelsberg Mine the Abzucht drove water wheels and was used for washing the ore. Inside the town walls and outside on its way to its confluence with the Oker it drove numerous water wheels that supplied the mills or other industrial works (fulling mills, saw mills, etc.) with energy. The use of its name interchangeably after its confluence with the Gose is still reflected today in several road names, such as An der Abzucht, An der Gose or Abzuchtstra√üe.

The Security Council was alarmed by the assassination attempt on President Mubarak and stated that those responsible should be tried. According to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), it was an attack against the stability of the entire African continent. It also noted that Sudan had not complied with requests from the OAU the question of the OAE to extradite suspects to Ethiopia. The Council was determined to eliminate international terrorism. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council again demanded that Sudan comply with the OAU request. Measures taken by several states to enforce the provisions of previous resolutions were noted and others that had yet to respond were urged to inform the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of measures they had taken as soon as possible. It was then decided that all countries should prohibit planes from Sudan or operated by Sudan Airways take off, land or to overfly their territory. The sanctions would not take effect until at least ninety days after the adoption of the current resolution. By 15 November 1996, the Secretary-General was asked to report on whether Sudan had complied with the OAU request. Resolution 1070 was adopted by 13 votes to none against, with two abstentions from China and Russia.

It is designed to invest in the rural development of five economic regions of Azerbaijan, focusing on community- based infrastructure development. (Note: in the Azerbaijani language AzRIP is known as Az…ôrbaycan K…ônd ƒ∞nvestisiya Layih…ôsi, or AzKƒ∞L.)http://www.azrip.org/ The objective of the project is to improve the living standards of communities that participate by increasing their access to infrastructure services, by the building and/or repair of roads, health clinics, schools, footbridges, electrical resources, potable water resources, and irrigation and drainage systems. The AzRIP project became effective on January 18, 2005 and at this time is planned to be completed March 31, 2012. Finances are provided through a loan from the World Bank to the Azerbaijan government, and ultimately reimbursed by Azeri taxpayers.http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=104231&piPK;=73230&theSitePK;=40941&menuPK;=228424&Projectid;=P076234  AzRIP Communities  AzRIP targets rural communities with more than 1,000 and less than 10,000 people in areas that meet the criteria for high poverty incidence. These communities cover all rayons of Azerbaijan, including Nagorno-Karabakh. The economic regions targeted by AzRIP and the Azerbaijan rayons in those regions include: * Lower Shirvan: Hajigabul, Kurdamir, Zardab, Ujar, Goychay, Aghdash, Yevlakh * Mughan Salyan: Jalilabad, Neftchala, Salyan, Saatly, Imishli, Bilasuvar, Sabirabad * Nakhchivan: Sadarak, Sharur, Shahbuz, Babek, Julfa, Ordubad, Kangarli * North: Ismayilli, Gabala, Oghuz, Sheki, Gakh, Balaken, Zagatala, Quba, Gusar, Shamakhi, Agsu, Khachmaz, Gobustan * Northwest: Gazakh, Agstafa, Gadabay, Dashkasan, Tovuz, Tartar, Goranboy, Samukh, Barda, Shamkir, Goy Gol  Project Components  AzRIP has three components: * Infrastructure. This includes the identification, design, construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure based on community's needs. Those needs are identified and prioritized by the communities with the help of AzRIP personnel. * Capacity Enhancement. The capacities of communities and support service providers are enhanced through training, conferences, seminars, consultations, and monitoring and evaluation. * Project Management. The administrative and operational project implementation and management costs are financed. This includes the training and/or hiring of qualified personnel to undertake the procurement, disbursement, and management of project finances, as well as the reporting, monitoring and evaluation of community projects.  How AZRIP Works  AzRIP provides communities with the managerial, financial and technical resources needed to manage their community projects. To do this, AzRIP uses the Community Project Cycle to find eligible communities and to train community members in the selection, implementation and maintenance of their projects. This includes six steps: # Information outreach and selection of communities # Community mobilization # Training of the communities in the preparation of community project proposals # Training of the communities in project registration, appraisal, approval, and forming cooperation agreements # Training of the communities in procurement and implementation # Project completion, handover and evaluation. Key highlights of the project are: # Communities are selected on the basis of their infrastructure needs, community assessments and their ability to organize themselves and implement and maintain projects. # AzRIP contributes up to 90% of the funds for projects; those funds are provided by the Azerbaijan government through loans from the World Bank. Communities must contribute at least 10% of the project funds, and at least 2% it must be in cash. The remaining 8% can be in their own labor or materials. # Selected communities participate in Community Mobilization facilitated by AzRIP Project Assistance Teams (PAT). The region's PAT visits the community and guides the community members in an open and transparent process of identifying their needs, prioritizing and selecting projects as well as electing a Community Project Committee. # The PAT trains the Community Project Committees along with members of the Municipalities, local ExComs and other community leaders in leadership, management, planning, accounting, procurement, project implementation, monitoring and grant proposal writing. # When the Community Mobilization and trainings are done, the communities design and plan their own projects and send project proposals to AzRIP for approval. They are helped by engineers they choose and with the assistance of the AzRIP engineers. # The approval of a project is based on its proper design, its appropriateness, the transparency of the community's approval and AzRIP's site appraisal. # For projects under $15,000, communities may procure materials and perform their own construction. For projects over $15,000 a contractor must be hired through an open competitive bidding process. # The community establishes a Maintenance Committee with community funds to maintain the project throughout its life. Sustainability is the key to a project's success. The community must make sure that either the municipality or Community Organizations ensure project operation, maintenance and sustainability. AzRIP projects are based on two principal documents: * The Project Appraisal Document (PAD), which describes the project's development objective and strategic plan, plus the project's description, sustainability and risks. The PAD is used by the community and AzRIP project staff throughout the project to monitor the performance of their official duties. * The Operations Manual (OM), which contains all of the necessary guidelines, rules and criteria for Capacity Enhancement and Community Project implementation. The OM has five volumes: ** Volume I: Policy and Guidelines ** Volume II: Operations Procedures ** Volume III: Reference Manual ** Volume IV: Public Information ** Volume V: Financial Information Volume III of the Operations Manual can be found in English and Azerbaijani on the AzRIP web site at http://www.azrip.org.  Other Azerbaijan Rural Development Nonprofits  Many international organizations support agriculture and rural community development in Azerbaijan. Some of those organizations are described here. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a United Nations agency, was established in 1977 to assist in the agricultural development of needy countries worldwide, including Azerbaijan. Grassroots Human Security Grant Assistance Program (GHSGAP), sponsored by the Embassy of Japan in Baku, Azerbaijan, supports rural community development. A water supply system development project in the Shamakhi rayon was completed in two parts by the two organizations, the first by GHSGAP and the second by AzRIP.AzRIP Quarterly Newsletter, June 2010  See also  * Azerbaijan * World Bank * Rural Development * Non-profit organization * Not Just For Profit  References   Bibliography  * World Bank Projects Database, https://web.archive.org/web/20110611213229/http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK;=64290415&theSitePK;=40941&menuPK;=228424&Projectid;=P076234 * \\"Second Phase of Azerbaijani Rural Investment,\\" The Azeri Times 13(16), https://web.archive.org/web/20090726044127/http://www.theazeritimes.com/site/economy/2299 * \\"Rural Investment Project in Azerbaijan: Contract for Training on Monitoring and Evaluation\\"; International Development web site http://www.devex.com/projects/rural-investment-project-in-azerbaijan-contract- for-training-on-monitoring-and-evaluatio---2 * \\"Az…ôrbaycan K…ônd ƒ∞nvestisiya Layih…ôsi,\\" R√ºbl√ºk B√ºlleten 4(11): Dekabr 2009. * \\"Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project,\\" Quarterly Newsletter 3(10): September 2009. * \\"AzRIP Operations Manual,\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20100227081354/http://azrip.org/content.php?page=manual * \\"Grassroots Human Security Grant Assistance Program,\\" http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/gaiko/oda/shimin/oda_ngo/kaigai/human_ah/pdfs/e-1.pdf  External links  * Category:Economy of Azerbaijan Category:Government agencies of Azerbaijan ","title":"Azerbaijan Rural Investment Project"},{"id":"27091201","text":"Long a may refer to: * Long a, the traditional name of a vowel in English: see * the letter ƒÄ.

Biography  Robert P√©rez Palou was born in Linyola, Lleida, Spain, where he continues to reside. The son of a farmer, he also grew up to become one despite his early displays of artistic talent. With no access to formal art education, P√©rez developed his technique on his own. In 1988 he began to paint professionally while continuing to farm, until 1995, when health problems forced him at the age of 47 to retire from agriculture. P√©rez thereafter reoriented his life to devote himself completely to his early calling of painting. He has participated in art shows including exhibitions in Barcelona, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Dubai, Japan and Madrid. P√©rez is related to soccer players Bojan Krkiƒá and Lionel Messi. Two great-great-grandfathers of Bojan and Mesi were brothers. P√©rez is a descendant of the same family tree, being the uncle of the mother of Bojan. It was P√©rez through his research in 2011 who discovered this common ancestry.  Style and works  P√©rez specializes in studio portrait painting using pastel, although he has also used Oil painting. His mastery of the technique has allowed him to paint portraits with a high level of accuracy and detail, making his paintings close to photo-realistic. GAL ART describes him as \\"Excellent portrait painter expressing himself through pastel; mastering the drawing and technique, unveils knowledge that could be put to the service of spectacular beauty\\". Josep Mar√≠a Cadena, analyzing Young Hindu, said \\"It is a realist piece produced in pastel; it is well done, especially in the care of the hands, which is usually one of the more difficult body parts to draw\\". P√©rez paints three types of portraits: public figures, anonymous ethnic portraits, and paintings of private citizens. In his public figures series he paints known people from the social, political and show business spheres, later frequently personally delivering the portrait to its subject. These are actors, singers, athletes, politicians and philanthropists such as Julio Iglesias, N√∫ria Feliu, Jos√© Carreras, Baroness Thyssen, Pep Guardiola, Maria del Mar Bonet, Jordi Pujol, Jos√© Mari Bakero, Marta Ferrusola. In his ethnic series P√©rez paints anonymous individuals from the third world, mostly from Africa and India. P√©rez also paints portraits commissioned by private citizens.

Speck deals with an empirical evaluation of a carbon tax as an environmental policy instrument. Adopting an quantitative econometric perspective, the paper shows that carbon taxes in Sweden did have a positive role in reducing CO2 emissions when applied to petrol, and equally much older energy taxes played a role in reducing CO2 emissions from coal and LPG use. At the same time, the role of electricity imports, the price of oil, ecological rucksacks of international trade and other factors are discussed in detail: *Shmelev S. E. Speck S. U.

This research developed from a series of lectures he gave at European universities on sustainability in Russia, where social and environmental aspects of economic development have been neglected. This methodology is particularly important for defining sustainability, assessing the progress towards sustainability of a given society or system.

The book made it absolutely clear that a truly multi-dimensional approach must be used. The album has been acknowledged and praised by Pope Francis, Prince Charles, President Macron, Prime Minister Rutte, Government of India and Sir David Attenborough. The book was launched at the Club of Rome 50th Anniversary conference, has been shown in a large exhibition of 32 photographs hosted by the University of Oxford and presented at the UNFCCC COP24 Conference on Climate Change. The endorsements read: ‚ÄúThe great challenge of our time is to build and nurture human communities that honor, respect, and cooperate with nature‚Äôs inherent ability to sustain life.

The first team currently play in the Division. In 2008‚Äì09 the club won promotion to the league from the Midland Combination Women's Football League, after beating Crewe 4‚Äì2 at Pride Park. In addition to the first team, the club runs a reserve team who compete within the national reserve team pyramid, and nine academy teams that compete in the Nottinghamshire Girls League, Derbyshire Girls League and the Central Warwickshire Girls League. The club enjoys a strong working relationship with the Derby County Girls Centre of Excellence, allowing a dedicated player pathway from youth football into the Derby County Ladies senior squads. History =The Birth of Derby County FC Women= The club that was to become Derby County LFC started out as the idea of Sheila Rollinson and Jess Reid, who at the time were both playing for the Coventry-based ladies side Holbrooks Athletic. Sheila had recently moved to the Derby area and Jess lived in Burton, so they came up with the idea of forming a new more locally based team. Adverts for players were placed in both the Burton Mail and the Derby Evening Telegraph and at that time more of the replies came from the Burton area, so Burton Wanderers was born. The club's first season was 1978/9 in the Midland League (which later became the West Midlands League) and saw the club playing at Shobnall Fields in Burton, with Phil Rollinson as manager and Bob Reid acting as club secretary. Training sessions were held in Bitham School sports hall. After one season in the Midland league the club decided to move to the Nottingham League (later the East Midlands League) due to the standard of football being of a higher level. At this time a national women's league was not in place and as such the club regularly played against teams such as Doncaster Belles, which at the time contained most of the England team. Junior leagues were not in place and with girls not being allowed to play in boys‚Äô teams, the side often had 11- 13 year olds playing alongside adults. With the demise of another local side, Derby Rangers, a number of experienced players joined the club and in 1985 the club secured its first sponsorship deal with the Beacon Hotel. The deal saw the club's name change to Beacon Wanderers. During this period Dave Elks enjoyed a lengthy spell as the club's manager before handing over to Malcolm Aldridge. Gradually the balance of players swung more towards the Derby area and as the club name no longer included Burton, it seemed sensible to move both matches and training sessions to Derby. For a while Leesbrook school was the venue for both before eventually Derby City Council's Parkers Piece ground became the club's home. In 1990, John Jarman started the Community Department at Derby County Football Club and in the same year he held discussion with the management of Beacon Wanderers which eventually led to the formation of Derby County Ladies FC. At that time the club consisted of a single open-age team, however the association with Derby County quickly saw it extended to a reserve and third team. The first manager of the newly formed DCLFC was Neil Crofts. =Early years= Training for DCLFC was moved from Leesbrook to the now defunct DCFC Ramarena training ground, with the club playing an FA cup tie there. In 1993 the FA were instructed by UEFA to take over the running of Women's football and as a result a structure was put into place which eventually saw the setting up of the National League structure. This was done on a selection as opposed to results basis, with the FA identifying which teams it felt were appropriate for leagues within the structure. As part of this the Midland Combination league was formed with Derby County becoming founder members. At this juncture Maggit and Deb Newham became the first female managers of the club. In 1997, Raffaele (Raf) Long made contact with the club in order to secure coaching hours to contribute to his UEFA B licence qualification. This marked the start of a long association with the club, which saw Raf become its Chairman, a post that he eventually relinquished in 2013. =The Millennium and a Rise to National League Level= =2001/02= DCLFC recruited their first \\"official\\" junior squads which led to them having U14 and U12 squads competing in Notts Girls League for first time. Both teams enjoyed hugely successful seasons with each achieving the league and cup double. The U14 were jointly managed by Alex Penny & Kristian Speakman who both went on to have careers in the professional game. Steve Hall managed the U12 side which included Precious Hamilton, a player who would go on to represent the club a senior level as well as going on to play WSL football for Notts County. The same season saw the club's senior side struggle under the helm of then manager, Richard Astle. A number had left the club to join Sandiacre Town and relegation to the Unison East Midlands League came in the penultimate game of the season when a 90th minute of injury time goal by Stafford Rangers saw both teams relegated. =2002/03= The following season was one of consolidation although the club did reach the league's cup semi final where they lost to eventual league champions, Nottingham Forest. At junior level the club continued to blossom with a number of successes achieved =2003/04= This season saw DCLFC strengthened at Junior level with the introduction of a further two age specific sides. At senior level, Steve Hall stepped up to become first team manager and under his stewardship the club secured runners up spot behind Leicester City, whilst they lost in the league cup final to the same side. =2004/05= This proved to be the club's most successful season to that point with their history, with the first team completing a league and cup double in the Unison East Midlands Premier Division, which saw them gain promotion to the Midland Combination League. The Reserves finished a creditable third in the newly formed Reserve division, and in doing so moved up a level to play in the Combination League. At junior level the club's sides continued to secure silverware on a number of fronts. =2005/06= Derby County Ladies participates as a founder member of the inaugural FA Midland Centre of Excellence programme, with teams competing at U16 and U14 age group. Their participation in the programme reaped immediate reward in the form of England recognition for U16 captain Cara Newton. At senior level the first team enjoyed a season of consolidation, finishing a creditable 4th in their first season in the Midland Combination League. Notable results included a seven-goal mauling of TNS (who were league leaders at the time) in January, and a single goal victory over eventual league champions Crewe in the last game of the season. The Reserves also competed admirably in their first season in the Midland Combination Reserves League. =2006/07 & 2007/08= Both seasons saw the club compete at the top end of the Midland Combination league, whilst the club's junior sides continued to enjoy successful seasons across the board. =2008/09= The 2008/09 season was seen as a landmark one in the club's history as the first team not only won the league cup but finally won the Midland Combination league following a 4‚Äì2 win over Crewe in final League game of the season. The fixture was played at Derby County FC's Pride Park stadium and the result saw the club gain promotion to the Women's Premier League. The club's Reserves won Reserve Cup, whilst their U16s, U12's and U10's all achieved league and cup double success. =2009/10= The Ewe Rams first season proved to be a tough baptism in the WPL. Needing two points from the last two games to ensure they retained their status in the league, Derby travelled to Aston Villa for the penultimate game of the season. With 30 minutes remaining they found themselves 2-0 down before staging a brilliant come-back, with a fantastic Emily Jeffery strike sealing a 3‚Äì2 victory and with it safety 2010/11 proved to be Steve Hall's final one as manager, prior to him stepping down and it proved to be a successful one as the club secured a commendable 5th-place finish behind league champions Aston Villa and runners up Coventry City. =2011/12= The next season saw former junior coach, John Bennett return to the club as its first team manager when John Townson's brief tenure in charge was halted when he was given a professional contract closer to his North West home. The season once again proved successful with the club again finishing 5th. Manchester City pipping Sheffield FC to the title =2012/13= The 2012/13 season proved to be poor after the previous two, and saw the club finish one place off the bottom of the league. However, with only one team being relegated and local rivals Leicester City securing only four points all season, the clubs were never in danger of losing their WPL status. During this season the FA announced the launch of the Women's Super league (WSL) and invited applications from clubs playing at Premier League level. Derby submitted an application to join the league, however it proved unsuccessful falling short of the required challenging criteria in a number of areas. Shortly after the outcome was advised, Raf Long ended his 16-year association with the club, as he stepped down as the club's chairman to take up the Director role at the Leicester City Centre Of Excellence. =National Awards and a Push Towards WSL= =2013/14= The club started the 2013/14 season without a chairman, however they were able to welcome FA Regional Coach John Griffiths to the club in a mentoring role initially to the club's senior coaching staff. On the back of the failed WSL bid, the club's committee decided to look towards a more commercially and business focused model and sought to appoint a new figure head to lead the club in addressing the shortcomings that had been identified within the failed bid. Duncan Gibb, an experienced Commercial Manager within the leisure and sport industry, took up an offer to join the club as its Chief Executive in September 2013. Gibb moved quickly to address two identified weaknesses, namely a lack of external investment and a poor profile. He secured club partners (sponsors) for each of the team's 10 sides before turning his attention to the club's profile and securing a dedicated slot for the club on BBC Radio Derby's Sportscene programme. On the back of this dedicated weekly club columns in both the Derby Telegraph and Burton Mail were secured on the back of meetings with the respective papers editors. On the pitch Gibb appointed Griffiths to a newly created Director Of Football role that saw him introduce a playing philosophy throughout the club and in essence run the football side of things, while Gibb looked to address the off field shortcomings within the WSL bid. The season proved to be John Bennett's last as manager and he guided the club to a respectable 7th-place finish after the previous disappointing season. Bennett took the decision due to family commitments and one of his last games at the helm saw the club win the Derbyshire County Cup for a third consecutive year beating Sandiacre Town 6‚Äì2 in the final. As part of its plans to raise the club's profile, a friendly match was secured against 11 times league champions and former Champions League winners, Arsenal FC. A club record crowd of 600 saw a full strength Arsenal side consisting of England internationals, Kelly Smith, Rachel Yankey and Casey Stoney eventually defeat a resilient Rams side 5-0 =2014/15= Following receipt of over 30 applications the club returned to a female manager, appointing Jenny Sugarman to the role. Unfortunately after an encouraging start to the season, results deteriorated and with the club firmly entrenched in a relegation battle they parted company with Sugarman shortly prior to Xmas. Reserve Team Managers, Ash Abbey and Jack White undertook the role in an interim basis steadying the ship, before Stuart Wilson was appointed at the start of February. Wilson had previously won the league with Aston Villa and had recently been interviewed for the England U17's management role. Ironically the role had been secured by John Griffiths who as a result was forced to relinquish his Director Of Football role at Derby County. Wilson's tenure couldn't have been any more challenging starting with two marquee friendly fixtures against firstly reigning WSL Champions, Liverpool and a week later against reigning FA Cup holders, Arsenal. The games saw both clubs field full strength sides with gates of over 600 witnessing each. The Liverpool game had been initially postponed due to a frozen pitch with over 1,000 tickets having already been snapped up, however the rescheduled date fell on the same night that the men's club played. With these marquee friendly fixtures out of the way, Wilsons impact was immediate and the side embarked on an incredible sequence of results that saw them not only avoid relegation, but secure a top half 6th-placed finish Off the pitch, representatives of the club attended the annual FA Awards in London, where they saw the club secure runners up spot in the FA Club Of The Year awards on the back of the previous year's developments both on and off the pitch. However the best was saved until last when club founder Sheila Rollinson picked up the main award of the night when she was recognised for her ‚Äò Outstanding Contribution To Women's Football ‚Äò. The award was not just seen as a hugely justified accolade for her part in the amazing journey of Derby County from a local parks side to an established WPL club, but for her contribution to the wider game. =2015/16= On the pitch the club increased its portfolio of teams to 11 with the introduction of an U18's side to act as a conduit between its senior and academy sides. At first team level the club continued where it left off the previous season and topped the table going into December before the club's form plummeted leading to early exits in both the FA and League Cups and a slump to 7th place in the league. With targets of a run in at least one of the cups and a top five finish agreed at the start of the season, Manager Stuart Wilson and his Assistant Neil Wilson left the club with three games of the season left, which included the Derbyshire County Cup tie with big spending Long Eaton. Despite only being able to field four first team players, Ewe Rams delivered a superb performance on the day resulting in a 5‚Äì1 victory under the guidance of Reserve Team Manager, Petter Asser. Off the field the club continued to make significant strides in a number of areas. Dave Cholerton was appointed to the newly created Academy Director role that saw him oversee each of the club's 9 junior sides, whilst the club's Executive Committee was replaced with a Board Of Directors consisting of a Finance Director, Operations Director, Media Director and Commercial Director. Reward for the club's progress was realised firstly at local level as the club won the Derby City Club Of the Year Award, before the club was acclaimed nationally when it walked away from the FA Awards at Wembley Stadium named as the ‚Äò FA Premier League Club Of the Year ‚Äò. As part of the club's ambitions to put into place the foundations of a subsequent WSL bid, the club relocated to Mickleover Sports FC's, Don Amott LG Arena in January 2016. =2016/17= The club continued to make significant strides off the pitch during the close season, while matching these on the pitch. Sam Griffiths, a UEFA A License Coach was appointed to the role of Director of Football with a view to re- imbedding the playing and coaching philosophies that her predecessor John Griffiths had begun to implement during his tenure in the role. In addition to this, John Bennett returned for his second spell as Manager and was joined by a number of locally based coaching and support staff, with the club openly stating in the media that it wished to return to the 'Derby Way' a moniker applied to the men's arm of the club in the media following the sacking of Paul Clement earlier in the year, but one that had been formally identified and applied to the club's ladies side back in 2013 by John Griffiths. As part of her early work, Griffiths introduced an Under 18's Development side to the structure increasing the number of sides within the club to 12, and re-branded the Reserve team the Development side as the club looked to further replicate the men's arm of the club in terms of an operating model. In terms of personnel the club invested in six new signings with all but one of those coming from the WSL. These included Sheffield FC club legend' Lisa Giampalma, Doncaster Belles' Molly Johnson and ex Manchester City player' Leanne De Silva. Off the field the club appointed Andy Moore as its Media Director with a remit of introducing the best club website outside of the WSL and improving the club's social media face. As part of his work Moore quickly moved towards formally establishing links with Derby Universities media studies section. With the addition of players and personnel the club once again delivered both on and off the pitch. On the pitch pre-season targets of a top five finish and a run in one of the cups were realised, as the club equalled its highest ever league position following a final day victory over local rivals Nottingham Forest. Bennett's side would however almost certainly have surpassed expectation and secured a top three finish, had it not been for a significant injury crisis to key personnel, that saw Lorna Abbey side-lined for the majority of the season, Sam Griffiths and Emily Jeffrey sustain season ending ACL injuries and Lisa Giampalma side-lined for six weeks with what was at one stage thought to be a career ending eye injury. Towards the end of the season things had in fact got that bad, that Bennett didn't have a single centre half to call on, having started the season with six of them ! Following a disappointing League Cup exit at the hands of Division 1, Chester Le-Street, Bennetts side progressed to the third round of the FA Cup on the back of victories over Huddersfield Town and Sheffield United. The win over The Blades saw them rewarded with a mouth-watering tie with local rivals Nottingham Forest, which saw the club once again break its record attendance with over 800 supporters creating a fantastic atmosphere. Whilst the crowd was easily the biggest of the competition at that stage and surpassed the men's clubs crowd for their Checkatrade Cup home tie with Mansfield Town, a solitary goal against the run of play saw the visitors progress to the next round. The club's Academy under, Dave Cholerton continued to develop with seven league titles and cup successes secured by the end of the season. Perhaps more pleasing than that was progressing of players from within the club's Under 18's side to the First Team, with forward Ellie May and goalkeeper Charlotte Clarke both featuring regularly towards the latter part of the season, with the former also being called up to John Griffiths England U17's squad. Off the field the club were once again in the mix at the FA Awards at Wembley, securing runners up in the 'FA Premier League Club Of The Year' category, whilst Academy Director, Dave Cholerton came runner up to former England legend, Hope Powell in the ‚Äò Outstanding Contribution To Women‚Äôs Football ‚Äô award. Cholerton's input into the club's delivery was probably best captured when 64 schools and over 700 pupils attended the club's annual schools football festival in March. The club's new website was launched at the start of November and was very quickly recognised as the best in the Premier League, fully justifying the appointment of Andy Moore as Media Director. By the end of the season the website had secured over 60,000 hits and was on course to deliver 150,000 within its first year. ‚ÄòPartnerships‚Äô were seen as the key priority for CEO, Duncan Gibb when he addressed the club's annual Xmas function at Pride Park Stadium and by the end of the season key partnerships with both Derby University and Merrill Academy were at an advanced stage of negotiation, whilst talks were also underway to discuss a long-term partnership commitment to Mickleover Sports and their Don Amott Arena ground. =2017/18= Going into the 2017/18 season, off the pitch the board set about aims to achieve five key partnerships over the course of two years but efficiently achieved all within one year, ensuring the future of the Ewe Rams was secure off the pitch as they prepared to switch their focus to the playing side. The first key partnership was secured with Merrill Academy with 1st Team training reverting to their impressive facilities that included a new 4G pitch, gym and physio facilities. The second key partnership that was secured was with Derby University where the club linked up with the newly formed Football Journalism course to create three scholarships for women football players each year, over the next three seasons to join both the course and the Ewe Rams. A video promo saw the likes of former England International Kelly Smith and leading Sports Journalist and Presenter Jacqui Oatley advertise the course and the first scholar was recruited for the 2018/19 season. With first team games having moved to Mickleover Sports FC back in Jan 2016, the club secured a third key partnership with the club signing a 3-year extension to the tenancy with both clubs signing a memorandum to explore the Ewe Rams becoming a stakeholder in the ground. Despite securing Merrill Academy as a partner with their excellent facilities, the opportunity for the club's senior teams to train at Derby County's Moor Farm Training facility become available and towards the end of the season, the club secured a fourth partnership, which became a prelude to the 5th partnership and moved its First Team training sessions to the training centre. The move to Moor Farm for 1st Team training was only the beginning of what become the Ewe Rams fifth and most important partnership when Derby County FC agreed to greater synergy and formed the #OneClub approach offering financial, operational and admin support to the Ladies arm of the team. During the 2017/18 season, the opportunity to apply for a place in a new look FA Women's Football League structure was opened and Derby County Ladies with the support of Derby County put in a strong application to become a semi-professional FA Women's Championship side. Despite a strong bid the application was turned down with the club remaining in the FA National League structure. Despite the rejection, the FA named the Ewe Rams as the Club of the Year for the second time in three seasons thus becoming the only two-time winners of the title. That along with being named both the Derby City Council Club of the Year and the Derby Telegraph Sports Club of the Year saw the club finish a successful season off the pitch. On the pitch, the club finished a mediocre 7th in the FA Women's Premier Northern Division, a poor season by the Ewe Rams standard with the club also dumped out of both Cup competitions by lower league opposition. Manager John Bennett announced towards the end of the season that he would step down from the Manager's position at the end of the campaign, ending his long association with the club. Having been the club's Director of Football for the past two seasons, Sam Griffiths relinquished that role to become the club's new Manager for the start of the 2018/19 season. Along with the decision to step into the Manager's hot-seat, Griffiths also retired from playing having not played since the 2016/17 season due to injury, thus concentrating on her new position. =2018/19= Off the pitch, the club secured an extra key partnership as the linked up with the UK's leading Sports College, Loughborough College to create an educational partnership for young women footballers aged 16‚Äì19. This partnership will see the club work with the college to provide opportunities for players to develop with the Ewe Rams. On the pitch, Griffiths recruited 10 players with a number of key signings joining including key signings Jodie Redgrave from Brighouse Town LFC, Steph Smith and Callan Barber from Coventry United LFC and Olivia Mitcham joining from Leicester City WFC. Also returning to the club was former fan favourite Cara Newton after a 3-year spell with local rivals Long Eaton United LFC. Also joining the club were Rachael Ball (From Stoke City LFC), Emily Joyce (Birmingham City WFC), Leah Kellogg (Long Eaton United LFC), Monique Watson (Doncaster Rovers Belles) and Moriah McIntosh (Leicester City WFC) With the closer synergy between the main club, the Ewe Rams were afforded an opportunity to play local rivals Nottingham Forest Ladies at Pride Park Stadium in early September in front of a new National League record of 2,109 fans, the second highest attendance seen to date across all leagues in the UK. The Ewe Rams secured the win in the fixture when local girl and Derby County fan, Amy Sims, headed the only goal of the game to ensure all three points. That proved to be a catalyst for the season with Sam Griffiths squad continuing their improvement in the league as crucial wins against Sunderland Ladies and Stoke City Ladies, and a 10‚Äì0 win over Bradford City Women saw the club head into the back end of the season looking for their best ever finish. That was achieved as the Ewe rams won their final four games of the season to finish joint second with Sunderland Ladies, only finishing below them on goal difference behind Champions Blackburn Rovers Ladies. Elsewhere, the Development Team regained the Derbyshire FA County Cup with a 4‚Äì0 win over Long Eaton United Ladies at their Grange Park home and it was a double celebration with Tommy Booth's side also finishing in their highest ever position In the FA Midland Reserve Division as they earned a runners-up spot behind Stoke City Women. The success was replicated in the Derby County Ladies Academy with 13 trophies across all clubs in the biggest Academy intake in the club's history and one that will be strengthen further with the addition of an Under 18's side next season. The Foundation Team also earned a move, as a runners-up spot in the Derbyshire Women's League saw them invited into the East Midlands Regional League and a rebranding as the Derby County Ladies Community side. Off the pitch, the strengthened alignment of the club with Derby County saw the Ewe Rams short-listed for 'Improving the Participation of Women & Girls Initiative' award at the annual FA Awards, held at St George's Park, the fifth straight year of nominations at the event and the only club with this accolade. =2019/20= It was a busy off-season for Manager Sam Griffiths with 7 new faces joining the club. Ellie Gilliatt made the move from FA Championship side Sheffield United WFC, to be joined by former Leicester City WFC trio Sherry McCue, Sarah Jackson and Sophie Domingo. Former Nottingham Forest captain Kelly Darby joined as did Stoke City WFC pair Hannah Keryakoplis and Emily Owen. The Ewe Rams said goodbye to club stalwarts Camilla Newton and Grace Harrison, whilst youngster Karagh Tait went to University in the US and football legend Andi Bell retired from Tier 3 football after a 20+ career, scoring goals for fun.

Two of the most widely known examples of Mesoamerican religion are the Aztec religion and the Mayan religion.  Cosmology  calendar from the Codex F√©jervary-Mayer (Codex Pochteca). (Lacambalam 2014) The cosmological view in Mesoamerica is strongly connected to the Mesoamerican gods and the spiritual world. The construction and division of the universe, therefore, is a visual and symbolic set up for their religious beliefs. Like the many different peoples of Mesoamerica, the detailed surface of the Mesoamerican cosmological views tends to vary greatly. These views do have some similarities, such as belief in a fundamental cosmic order, in which the elements of time and space are the most important. These two elements are seen as the center of the universe and make the center of the quadruplicity, known as the Mesoamerican world tree, quite close to the quincunx. =Space and time= The importance of time is seen in the cycles of life, death and regeneration, which are similarly worshiped in most religions. Time is symbolized in the cycle of the sun, for Mesoamericans believed that the sun separates night and day, and that the death and regeneration of the sun is the reason for a new era. As an expansion of quincunx, which symbolizes space, two axes combine the universe with the inclusion of both the natural and the spiritual, vertically and horizontally. It is called the axis mundi, which in the case of mesoamerican cosmology, vertically consists of three worlds and horizontally of four directions and a center. In the vertical axis; the world on the surface of earth, in the middle; a world above where the stars are, and then a world below our surface. These three worlds are not to be confused with the Christian division of a heaven and a hell, although the Spaniards, in trying to convert the native Mesoamerican, made the two comparable by doing so.Markman and Markman, The flayed god (page number?) Pantheon The Mesoamerican pantheon includes dozens of gods and goddesses in addition to the major deities described below. Tlaloc (Aztec) / Chaac (Maya) / Dzahui (Mixtec) / Cocijo (Zapotec) - Chief rain god; deity of water, fertility, rain, and storms, also with mountain associations. Recognizable by his goggle-like eyes and distinctive fangs. Quetzalcoatl (Aztec) / Kukulkan (Yucatec Maya) / Q'uq'umatz (K'iche' Maya) - Plumed Serpent; god of wind, priests, merchants, and the link between the earth and the sky. Tezcatlipoca (Aztec) - \\"Smoking Mirror\\"; guileful omnipresent deity of cosmic struggle, feuds, rulers, sorcerers, and warriors; the jaguar is his animal counterpart. God K (Maya) - Some similarities with Tezcatlipoca, but also connected with lightning and agriculture, and exhibits serpentine features. Huitzilopochtli (Aztec) - Preeminent god and tutelary deity of the Aztecs in Tenochtitlan, where his temple with adjoined Tlaloc's atop a great pyramid constituting the dual Templo Mayor. Deity of the sun, fire, war and the ruling lineage.Miller, Mary and Karl Taube. 1993. The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya. Colonized Mesoamerica When the Spanish first arrived in Mesoamerica, they ransacked the indigenous peoples' territory, often pillaging their temples and places of worship. Beyond this, the devoutly Catholic Spaniards found the standing Mesoamerican spiritual observances deeply offensive, and sought to either cover up or eradicate their practice. This resulted in the erasure of Mayan religious institutions, especially those centered on human sacrifice and propitiation of the multi-deistic pantheon. Martial values and human sacrifice were a ritualistic core of Mesoamerican spirituality prior to European incursion, but quickly dissolved in the early stages of Imperial rule. Pre-Hispanic warrior culture in Mesoamerica placed high value on capturing enemies on the battlefield; killing on the battlefield therefore was not encouraged and in fact considered brutish and sloppy. This emphasis on non-lethal combat is evidenced in the fact that Aztec warriors were promoted on the basis of however many captive warriors they could bring back from the battlefield, not on sheer destructive ability to kill. Prisoner capture between rival cultures provided both sides with sacrificial victims for deity propitiation, wars even being pre-arranged by both sides, the so-called Flower wars. This practice was ultimately made impossible once Spain had subjugated the Yucatan Peninsula. The deity Huitzilopochtli in particular had a devoted blood cult, as it was believed that without his continued sustenance the cosmos would be plunged into darkness. Less violent rituals were calculatedly suppressed as well, with the Spanish authorities deeming them anathema in light of their own spiritual preconceptions. When the Spaniards and their Tlaxcalteca allies besieged Tenochtitlan after having been forced out for preemptively massacring unarmed celebrants, the Aztecs struck back and sacrificed their Iberian captives to Huitzilopochtli, but ultimately the Aztecs could not defend the city after a devastating smallpox epidemic killed many warriors and leaders including the tlatoani himself. Even though the Aztecs continued to worship some of their own gods after the conquest, worshipping in secret and even disguising deities as nominal Catholic saints, the cult of the war god was totally suppressed. Indeed, Huitzilopochtli is still much less well understood than other major deities such as Tlaloc or Quetzalcoatl, and little was written about him in what sources survive from the decades following the conquest.Handbook of Middle American Indians Volume 6. 1967. University of Texas Press. Pp 370-371 The early friars in colonized Mesoamerica wrote manuals describing indigenous rituals and practices, to define precisely what was acceptable and unacceptable, and to recognize the unacceptable when they saw it. From the start, authorities recognized the subversive potential of recording the details of \\"idolatry\\" and discouraged putting anything down in writing that might preserve pre-conquest religion. If tolerated at all, the recording these observations was a very subjective project, and only few of the manuals have even survived. Things considered to be \\"diabolical\\" varied depending on the reporting friar, one manuscript justifying a practice that another manuscript might condemn.Burkhart, Louise M. 1997. Indian Women of Early Mexico. University of Oklahoma Press. Missionaries in Mesoamerica attempted to take already existing symbols and elements in the local indigenous religions and societies, and give them Christian meaning and symbolism; e.g., the Mesoamerican world tree, which they interpreted as a cross. But at the same time they also demonized other elements, which were considered to not comply with Christian beliefs. They did this to make it easier to convert the Mesoamericans to Christianity. Before the Spanish conquest each village had a patron deity whose idol was worshipped, presented with offerings and adorned with jewelry and fine robes. After the conquest, each village got in its place a Roman Catholic patron saint whose image was adorned and worshipped like before.Handbook of Middle American Indians Volume 6. 1967. University of Texas Press. P 378 And destinations of pilgrimage where the indigenous peoples used to worship gods before the conquest, were adapted to Catholic saints like the Se√±or de Chalma (Chalma, Malinalco, Mexico State) and the Virgen de los Remedios ( Virgin of Los Remedios ) The Aztecs and the Maya shared many religious elements before the Spanish conquest, but reacted very differently to the same form of Spanish Catholicism. The Aztecs abandoned their rites and merged their own religious beliefs with Catholicism, whereas the relatively autonomous Maya kept their religion as the core of their beliefs and incorporated varying degrees of Catholicism.Handbook of Middle American Indians Volume 6. 1967. University of Texas Press. P 370 The Aztec village religion was supervised by friars, mainly Franciscan. Prestige and honor in the village were achieved by holding office within the religious organizations. It was not possible for the indigenous to enter the Orders or receive sacramental ordination as secular priests.Handbook of Middle American Indians Volume 6. 1967. University of Texas Press. Pp 379-380 From the 17th century on, Spanish clergy had very little to do with religious development in most Mexican villages and this gave free rein to Aztec religious syncretism. ) Greatly aiding the early missionaries was the image known as the Virgen de Guadalupe.

Sons of Perdition premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on April 24, 2010, having sold out at the box office within one hour from the time tickets went on sale.  Background  \\"Sons of perdition\\" is a term used by some Latter Day Saint denominations, including the FLDS Church, to describe former members who have apostatized from their religion and faith. The term is derogatory and intended to convey unholiness, sin and evil. Within the FLDS Church in the border towns of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, under the severe rule of prophet Warren Jeffs, hundreds of teenage boys were exiled from their homes and families among the FLDS faithful for infractions such as wearing short-sleeved shirts, listening to music or talking to girls. Whether forced out by church leadership or a deliberate choice to escape the harsh environment, the exiled teenage boys were shunned by their families and community. As a result of their limited education and lifelong insulation from the world apart from their polygamous community, these \\"lost boys\\" were ill-equipped to manage life on the outside of the church. Many of the youngsters turned to drugs or alcohol to cope with the traumatic separation; others found themselves in trouble with the law. Directors Tyler Measom and Jennilynn Merten followed these Lost Boys for four years to bring to the film the personal perspective of the exiled boys. As described by one film reviewer: > Sons of Perdition's concentration on Joe, Bruce, and Sam‚Äîand, to a lesser > extent, their exiled compatriots‚Äîis a shrewd one, allowing for a focused > examination of the toll wrought by such an upbringing on teens undergoing > the process of self-definition. Less a definitive historical account of > American polygamy than a study of a very particular strain of post-traumatic > stress disorder, Measom and Merten's doc is cautiously inspiring in its > snapshot of independence blossoming amidst oppression, heartbreaking in its > empathetic portrayal of lost young men permanently scarred by their elders, > and infuriating in its clear-sighted depiction of the criminal and emotional > horrors perpetrated in the service of religious psychosis. Measom and Merten found the subject matter appealing in part because of their own experience of having abandoned the Mormon faith they grew up in.  Cast  The documentary features three teenage boys, Sam Zitting, Joseph Broadbent, and Bruce Barlow. At the time of filming, all three were living in St. George, Utah, having left the dictates of Warren Jeffs and the FLDS Church, whose members resided in the Arizona‚ÄìUtah twin cities of Colorado City and Hildale (known also as the Crick or Short Creek). The film also features Utah private investigator Sam Brower. Release On April 24, 2010 Sons of Perdition made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival premiere in New York. At the 2010 AFI- Discovery SilverDocs Documentary Film Festival, Sons of Perdition was selected for the Sterling U.S. Feature Competition. Sons of Perdition was acquired by the Oprah Winfrey Network and was broadcast in June 2011.

Synopsis The story revolves around two daughters of ageing rock star Danny Kilman. The first, Destiny, is the result of a short fire made by a fan who played with matches, and lives with idealistic mother Kate on a rundown estate called Bilefield in Manchester. The second is Sunset, his oldest legitimate child, who doesn't enjoy the hectic, drama filled life that comes from being the daughter of a celebrity. As part of Destiny's eleventh birthday, Kate has arranged they go to the London premiere of the film \\"Milky Star\\", in which Danny has a cameo as himself, where hopefully they'll be able to meet him and tell him Destiny is his daughter. The plan fails, as only Sunset seems to notice the two. Kate realises she hasn't planned how to get home, and they're stranded in London till morning. She decides they might as well use the time to seek out Danny at his home in Robin Hill. Destiny climbs over the fence and comes across Sunset in the garden. The two become fast friends and Sunset believes her story about them being sisters, but Destiny and Kate get thrown off the premises when Sunset's mother Suzy discovers them. After finding their way back home, Destiny heads to school. Her teacher, Mr Roberts, announces they're doing an end-of-year talent show called \\"Bilefield's got Talent\\" to celebrate the end of elementary school. Destiny decides to sing the Danny Kilman song \\"Destiny\\", which she's named after. Mr Roberts decides to put her on last, due to being the best act in the class. Sunset tries to convince Danny that Destiny is his daughter, but he insists it's a lie to get money and attention from the media. To make up for failing, Sunset finds out Destiny's address, using the Danny Kilman fan- site, and sends her a letter and a leather jacket. At the grand birthday party for Sweetie, Sunset's sister, Suzy and Danny get into a fight. Danny walks out with an actress Sunset has dubbed \\"Big Mouth\\", who's real name is Lizzie. At the first run of the talent show, the judges panel is made up of students and it's treated like a popularity contest. Destiny is marked second to last place, because she's new and isn't part of any of the local gangs, the Flat boys and the Speedos. At the evening version, however, the teachers judge and Destiny comes first place. She sends Sunset a copy of the DVD recording. The next day, Kate confesses the reason she's suddenly become insistent on Danny Kilman knowing about Destiny is she's worried she might be ill and wants to know Destiny will be looked after if the worst happens. Destiny insists that Kate see a doctor and they find out that Kate has hyperthyroidism. Danny returns to Robin Hill with his manager, Rose-May, to tell the family about a chance to start Sweetie's star-career early. She qualifies to be on a show called Little Darlings about talented child of celebrities. Debs, the producer arrives the next day to see if Sweetie can sing, but as she's about to she loses her first tooth and starts crying. Debs decides Sweetie is too young to handle being on television. As she's about to leave, Sunset remembers the DVD and shows her. Destiny's striking resemblance to Danny and her amazing singing voice convince Danny, Rose-May, and Debs she's Danny's daughter, and they decide they can use it as a publicity stunt to distract from the recent bad press Danny's been getting for running off with Lizzie \\"Big Mouth.\\" Debs gets in contact with Destiny and Kate, and offers them a chance to be on Little Darlings and meet Danny. Destiny accepts and they're driven to London. They film her being reunited with Danny and she finally gets to see Sunset again.

He refers to the verse \\"My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips,\\"Psalms 89:35 [A.

He visited Egypt, the Middle East and other regions. Early life William Mounsey was christened on 25 January 1808 at St Cuthbert's Church in Carlisle, Cumberland. His father Robert Mounsey was a solicitor. The family home, Rockcliffe Manor, was at Rockcliffe, north-west of Carlisle. Army career Mounsey was intended to be a solicitor, like his father, but first had a military career. He purchased a commission as an ensign in the 15th Foot on 28 May 1829. He was promoted to lieutenant on 4 January 1833 and to captain on 14 April 1837.Hart, H. G. Hart's annual army list (1844) In 1838 he transferred to the 4th Foot and retired from the army in 1844. He sold his captaincy, returned to England and took over the family business as solicitor, possibly after his father's death. Antiquarian The Dwarfie Stane, Island of Hoy, Orkney Mounsey's inscription on the Dwarfie Stane Circa 1850 he became an amateur archaeologist. In his civilian life he was a solicitor. He spoke fluently Greek, Latin, Persian, Welsh and of course English. According to the 1851 census, he was living in Castle Street, Carlisle with his sisters Margaret, Mary and Ann, and was the holder of property chiefly vested in landed security. After his retirement he wandered in the UK dressed in a Jewish outfit and was known as the \\"Jew of Carlisle\\". During military service in the Middle East he had become fascinated by Jewish culture. Mounsey himself designed his priestly costume and had a long beard. It has been claimed that he worked as a spy in Persia and Afghanistan and this is how he mastered the Persian language. He is known for a carved inscription he left on the Dwarfie Stane, a Neolithic rock-cut tomb in an erratic block on the island of Hoy in Orkney.\\"Orkney: Peace with all the trappings of war\\" (21 Feb 2001) telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 27 May 2010. Mounsey camped here in 1850 and inscribed in Persian script in the sandstone: \\"I have sat two nights and so learnt patience\\", this is taken to be a reference to the Highland midge. Above the Persian is his own name written backwards in Latin script as 'YESNUOM SUMLEILUG'.Ritchie, A. Prehistoric Orkney (1995) Batsford Ltd http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/E/Scotland/Orkney/DwarfieStane.htm There is an information sign with remarks about the Persian inscription; his surname is spelled 'Mouncey'. To the right of the Persian text is another one, possibly with the same quotation, but largely obliterated. The combination of the Persian text (right to left) and his own name written in the same way is striking. He also left his mark on ancient sites in Cumberland. In 1850 he traced the course of the River Eden from the Solway Firth to its source in Mallerstang and set up a monument to mark the source of the river. It was an inscribed Dent-marble pillar with Hebrew, Greek and Latin elements. The Star of David was depicted. The pillar was smashed in 1870 by railway workers. In Outhgill (Cumbria) there is a replica made of limestone, called the \\"Jew Stone\\",Emett, C. William Mounsey and the \\"Jew\\" stone (1990) Castleberg placed in 1989 after the visit of a Jewish traveller, named Shalom Hermon, who saw the broken original in 1984. The Latin inscription translated reads: \\"William Mounsey, a lone traveller, commenced his journey at the mouth and finished at the source, fulfilled his vow to the genius and nymphs of the Eden on 15 March 1850\\". He carved a 9th-century Welsh verse on the walls of a pre-Roman archaeological site in 1852 and left other inscriptions near the river Eden. Letters carved in reverse are typical for Mounsey. Probably, he was the sculptor of a series of five enigmatic faces cut into the sandstone cliffs of Eden gorge near Armathwaite.Scholes, R. Walking in Eden (1997) Sigma Leisure Possibly the faces were a kind of self-portrait.http://www.english- lakes.com/armathwaite.htm There is a similarity between the faces, especially between the nicely worked out ones with moustache. The heads are middle-aged, like Mounsey at that time. Supposing that inscription and faces are contemporary and both done by Mounsey in 1855. This is certainly a possibility or more, considering the already mentioned arguments, pointing to his eccentricity with his urge to leave his mark during his wanderings. The inscriptions on Hoy (with his name and 1850) and near the river Eden (with 1855) are in the same bold style, have curious texts and are from the same period. The inscription near the river Eden consists of a quotation from Isaac Walton's Compleat Angler. So the nearby carved salmon could be done by Mounsey too. The carving of the heads by him is at least plausible. There are five heads, between them is a carved salmon and above them are some lines of poetry. All in soft sandstone and presumably done by Mounsey. In the book The Eden Way (Charlie Emett; 1990) two of the carved heads are depicted with the text: \\"Rock carvings by William Mounsey\\" but this is contrary to text elsewhere in the book; for instance: \\"The faces do not appear to carry the Mounsey stamp\\". There is a Stuart fireplace overmantel with similar faces, in the possession of Peter Ecroyd, who owns the part of the river near the faces (1990). He believes that the carved heads are older and not carved by Mounsey. But an older fireplace overmantel does not mean that the carving is earlier, because it could be done later. A carved head close to the end of Mounsey's inscription near the date is a striking fact. He was fascinated by a maze or labyrinth near the boathouse in Rockcliffe marsh. It was one of a number that have been cut on the marsh in the peat at different times. He believed these to represent Caerdroia, or the Walls of Troy, and to be restricted to land occupied by Celtic people.Watt, J. A short history of Rockcliffe, Cumberland (1952) In 1858 Mounsey drew attention to the description in a Welsh book Drych y Prif Oesoedd (Mirror of the Early Centuries) by Theophilus Evans (1716) of a custom formerly prevalent among Welsh shepherds of cutting in the turf a figure in the form of a labyrinth, a turf maze, which they called Caerdroia.Matthews, W.H. Mazes and Labyrinths (1922) His study Tales ‚Äì The Children of Lir and Cath Cluana Tairbh, (1859), and his Welsh version of Purgatorium S. Patricii, c.1860, are held in the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. These are examples of his fascination for the Celts, but he was also interested in other cultures. Three books, one about Spinoza (Exposition des sentiments de Spinosa) and another about Persia (Curiositez inovyes) and one about ancient grammar (Institutiones grammaticae Anglo-Saxonicae et Moeso- Gothicae), are now in the Dutch Royal Library and Open Library and State Library of New South Wales with 'W. H. Mounsey' stamped in them.Ritman, A. W.

She spent the first half of her career working mainly in Europe (particularly Warsaw) and then was predominantly active in Canada after moving to that nation in 1944. In Canada she worked under the stage name \\"Ruth Sorel\\", but in Europe she was known under her maiden name, Abramovitsch (sometimes spelled Abramowitz). The Canadian Encyclopedia states that Abramovitsch Sorel was, \\"A well-known, expressive performer, who was praised by local and international critics for her intensely theatrical German dance style, her literary inspiration and the emotion, musicality and precision of her execution... Working in Canada prior to the existence of grants for innovation, Sorel was a pioneer of European expressionism in Qu√©bec.\\" As a choreographer she was at the forefront of modern dance and contemporary ballet, combining two contrasting elements: German expressionist dance and classical ballet. For many years she operated and directed her own dance company in Montreal, Les Ballets Ruth Sorel (also known as the Ruth Sorel Modern Dance Group). Early life and career Born to Polish-Jewish parents in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Abramovitsch Sorel studied Dalcroze eurhythmics before becoming a dancer in Mary Wigman's company in Dresden in 1923 where she remained for six seasons. From 1927-1933 she was a principal dancer with the Berlin State Opera where she was much admired as the lead soloist in the ballet Legend of Joseph. Abramovitsch Sorel was forced to leave the Berlin State Opera by the Nazis due to her Jewish heritage and Communist leanings. She left Germany for Poland in 1933 where she soon won first prize at the international solo dance competition in Warsaw for her performance of Salom√©'s dance of the seven veils. From 1933-1939 she taught dance and directed student productions at Warsaw's advanced dance school. She also actively performed in Poland during those years, often appearing with dancer George Groke with whom she gave performance tours to Palestine and the United States during the 1930s. At the outbreak of World War II she emigrated from Poland to Brazil. She attempted to start a dance academy in that nation but was unsuccessful. Career in Canada and later years in Poland In 1944 Abramovitsch Sorel emigrated to Canada with her husband, the author Micha≈Ç Choroma≈Ñski. The couple settled in Montr√©al and Sorel soon opened a number of dance studios in the area, including studios in Westmount, Shawinigan, and Trois-Rivi√®res. At the latter studio she frequently presented her most gifted students in recital, often dancing herself. Abramovitsch Sorel quickly established herself as an important choreographer and dancer in the Qu√©bec region, now using the stage name \\"Ruth Sorel\\". She formed the Les Ballets Ruth Sorel which had a triumphant success representing Qu√©bec at the first Canadian Ballet Festival (CBF) in 1948 in Winnipeg. Later the National Film Board of Canada's documentary of the CBF included sequences from her celebrated Mea Culpa Mea Culpa, a medieval mystery. Sorel's dance company performed her choreography on tours in Canada and in the United States, notably giving performances at dance festivals in New York City and at Montr√©al's Chalet du Mont-Royal. In 1949 she had a major success in Montreal with La Gasp√©sienne, the first choreography with Qu√©b√©cois content, which used music by Pierre Brabant. The ballet was given performances in Toronto, New York City, and at the Great Theatre, Warsaw in 1950. In 1955 Abramovitsch Sorel and her husband left Canada suddenly for Poland. She lived in Warsaw for the remainder of her life. She died there in 1974 at the age of 66.

History Ground was broken for the Butterfly House in June 1997, and The Butterfly House opened its doors to the public on September 18, 1998. In 2000 the outdoor area known as the Butterfly Garden was dedicated. In July, 2001, the Butterfly House became a division of the Missouri Botanical Garden. In 2002, the \\"Emerson Lakeside Terrace\\" was opened. This plaza area is the site for many special events, both public and private. The Butterfly House also started participating with the Butterfly Conservation Initiative (BFCI) of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums In 2003, the Butterfly House was accredited by the AZA, becoming the only dedicated insect facility in this organization. In 2007, the historic Faust Family greenhouse structure was renovated, and started supplying much of the food needs for the animals. The facility was also recognized by El Bosque Nuevo as having purchased enough pupae from this sustainable butterfly farm for it to purchase an additional of land. Exhibits and facilities Butterflies feeding The main hallway contains several smaller exhibits, including Small Wonders, which focuses on habitats and lifestyles of invertebrates and arachnids, Butterflies of the World, which focuses on butterfly diversity, a children's video called Butterflies, and Aquatic Invertebrates. The Emerson Family Theater shows \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", a 17-minute introduction to butterfly behaviors and anatomy, twice each hour, and the Lopata Learning Lab provides formal classroom space for the educational activities of the Butterfly House. The Conservatory Garden is an glasses-in indoor habitat for butterflies. It consists of 5 vaults, the tallest of which is high at its apex to minimize visual (and flight) obstruction. This carefully controlled tropical environment houses as many as 80 butterfly species and 150 tropical plant species. In the \\"Miracle of Metamorphosis\\", hundreds of chrysalides from around the world are on display for visitors to watch the process of metamorphosis. Outdoors overlooking a reflecting pond is the Emerson Lakeside Terrace, a multi-use area available for rent that can host weddings, receptions, corporate dinners, and other large gatherings. Next to this is the Butterfly Garden, a demonstration garden where plants were carefully selected to serve as hosts for caterpillars and nectar sources for butterflies, as well as habitat for other animals in the adjacent Faust Park.

Individual poll aggregation  A poll aggregator may also forecast the likely outcome of upcoming elections by gathering and analysing pre-election polls published by others, and/or utilizing other available politics-related information which, according to its methodology, may affect the outcome of an election. For example, an aggregator may attempt to predict the winner of a presidential election or the composition of a legislature, or it may focus on attempting to determine current opinion by smoothing out poll-to-poll variation. Editorial commentary by the site's owners and others complements the data. Interest and web traffic peak during the last few weeks before the election. How individual polls are aggregated varies from site to site. Some aggregators take a long- or short-term running/rolling average or average the polls at certain points in time, while other aggregators might take a weighted poll average (e.g., giving less weight to older polls), or use some other proprietary method of aggregation, based on such factors as past pollster accuracy, age of the poll, or other more subjective factors. The averaging method has been criticized by at least one statistician because it doesn't weight them by sample size.\\"Election Handicappers Are Using Risky Tool: Mixed Poll Averages\\", the Numbers Guy, Wall Street Journal, February 15, 2008 In this way the resulting average support percentages do not reflect the actual support percentage for any candidate of the pooled polls. According to the American Association for Public Opinion Research, \\"[o]ther aggregators use regression-based analyses ‚Äî a method for adjusting data to account for unusual results (‚Äúoutliers‚Äù). Other aggregators combine additional data like historical election results or economic data with current polling data through statistical methods ‚Äì these are often called modelers.\\" Aggregators are not capable of accounting for systematic errors in the polls themselves. For instance, if pollsters are misjudging the turnout demographics, aggregators cannot undo these errors. Likewise, when there is a tendency to herd (i.e. for different pollsters to converge on a particular result to avoid being an outlier), aggregators will reflect this. Aggregators are useful in U.S. presidential elections because the presidency is determined by the winner of state by state elections (see Electoral College), and not by simple popular vote of the entire nation. Consequently to predict a winner, polls of individual states becomes more significant. An equivalent issue may arise in parliamentary systems if the legislature is sufficiently malapportioned as in Canada. Veteran political journalist Bill Moyers has commented that poll aggregators are a good tool for sorting out the polls.\\"Margins of Error. Poll Reading Tips\\", Bill Moyers Journal, October 24, 2008 Real Clear Politics was the first such web site. It began aggregating polls in 2002 for the congressional elections that year. Several sites existed by 2004, including Andrew S. Tanenbaum's Electoral-vote.com,Homepage ElectoralVote and Sam Wang's Princeton Election Consortium.Homepage Princeton Election Consortium Relative newcomer FiveThirtyEight began in 2008 by baseball statistician Nate Silver and has been lauded for the quality of its analysis. Pollster.com by Mark Blumenthal, now affiliated with the Huffington Post as Huffpost Pollster,Huffpost Pollster has likewise been given a top ranking for the depth and breadth of its chartable polling data.\\"Your Guide to Political Polling Sites\\", MediaShift, National Public Radio, October 16, 2008 Since 2010 the political blog Talking Points Memo has also sponsored a \\"PollTracker\\" feature which aggregates opinion polls. Other noteworthy examples include Drew Linzer's Votamatic,Homepage votamatic.org Josh Putnam's Frontloading HQHomepage Frontloading HQ as well as Politics by the NumbersPolitics by the Numbers Blog by Jay DeSart and Tom Holbrook. For an aggregator of poll aggregators see the PollyVote, which combines different polling averages as one component of a combined forecast of the US presidential election result. In Australia, William Bowe's Poll Bludger hosts the Bludger Tracker poll aggregator. For another example of aggregating other poll aggregators, discussed in more detail below, see Politicrunch. Polling aggregations are now common throughout the world. Some European polls are aggregated at pollofpolls.eu. A major Australian aggregator is BludgerTrack.  Aggregating poll aggregators  Given the proliferation of poll aggregators such as those mentioned above, a notable approach to poll aggregation is not to aggregate individual polls as has been done for years, but rather to aggregate the poll aggregators so as to (arguably) provide an even more stable overview of polling data. PollyVote, noted above, is a prominent example of an aggregator of poll aggregators.

Bemi is a Canadian architect who practiced in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from 1955 to 2005. During his prolific career, he contributed over 300 buildings to the National Capital area, including significant projects such as St. Basil‚Äôs Church, the Main Branch of the Ottawa Public Library, the downtown YM-YWCA, and the Ottawa Police Headquarters.University of Carleton Archives, George Bemi. Accessed 21 April 2010. His buildings are primarily designed in a Modernist or Brutalist style of architecture, characterized by massive concrete forms, asymmetrical volumes, curtain wall, honest materiality, and a play between solids and voids. Early life Born into a low income family in 1926, Bemi grew up in a working-class neighborhood in the north end of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. At the age of fifteen, he dropped out of school and took up odd jobs to help support his family. On the outbreak of WWII, he enlisted in the Navy at only seventeen and served as a stoker for two years. Although after returning from the war he had no plans to become an architect, he was rejected from the fire‚Äìfighting department because he was still too young to be accepted into the pension plan. He then approached the Department of Veteran affairs, an organization developed to help veterans re-integrate into society. Since, he had previously shown promise at drawing in school so it was suggested he become a draftsman. The Department of Veteran Affairs offered a month-for-month education program in which war veterans were entitled to one month of free education for every month served in the war. Grants were provided for those who wished to continue onto university afterwards. Through this program, Bemi completed an accelerated high school diploma at the Ford Plant, one of the temporary schools set up to educate war veterans. He subsequently went on to study architecture at the University of Manitoba, graduating in 1951. Career Bemi emerged from university during the post-war construction boom and immediately established a contracting business, Associated Architectural Services. The service completed construction drawings for architecture firms that were not able to handle the sudden influx of projects. He then went on to work for Defense Construction Limited, a government organization formed in 1951 with the mandate to expedite construction of military projects due to the Korean War. From there, he obtained a position with the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, a government organization established in 1946 to deal with post-war housing shortages. CMHC transferred Bemi to Ottawa where he continued to practice for the remainder of his career. In 1955, he joined the Montreal firm of Greenspoon, Freelander, and Dunn, as the architect in charge of their Ottawa division. Two years later, when the firm asked him to relocate to Montreal for the Jeanne-Mance slum clearance project, he declined and established his own firm of Bemi & Associates. He continued his own architecture practice until 2005, designing over 400 buildings and garnering several professional awards. In 2000, he was inducted into the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada‚Äôs College of Fellows for his contributions to architecture in the National Capital region. Architectural Works George E. Bemi‚Äôs earlier works were primarily Modernist buildings, but as his firm matured it evolved a Brutalist style of architecture. Projects such as Sampan Restaurant and Champlain Towers, which both won Ontario Architecture Association awards, exhibit strong modernist qualities: an exposed structure, a minimal and refined palette of materials, a lack of ornamentation, and a grid system. Later works reflect more expressive characteristics of the Brutalist style. The firm‚Äôs more important government commissions, including the Ottawa Congress Centre and the Ottawa Downtown Library, were part of this later body of work. These projects established Bemi & Associates as one of the leading architecture firms practicing in the National Capital region at the time. =St. Basil‚Äôs Church 1960= In 1959, Bemi & Associates hired Tim Murray and from 1960-2 the firm became Bemi, Murray & Associates. In 1960, the firm completed its first major recognized work, St. Basil‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church. The intimate, circular design fit seating for 700 people within 70 feet of the altar.\\"St. Basil's Roman Catholic Church Ottawa\\" Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, Dec 1961, 49. Due to the close nature of the church, an acoustical study was done to limit echoing. As a result of the study‚Äôs recommendations, the unique form of the church emerged. The design consisted of undulating walls topped by a thin-shelled concrete dome, sunken so that its centre point lay below grade. The most innovative aspect of the design was that the priest faced the congregation, six years before this was approved by the Second Vatican Council. =Ottawa Public Library Main Branch= The Ottawa Downtown Library is a concrete, sculptural, Brutalist building and was the firm Bemi & Associates‚Äô most notable project.University of Carleton Archives, George Bemi. Accessed 21 April 2010. The building replaced the neo-classic Carnegie Library that was demolished due to unstable soil conditions. A 10-foot high stained glass window was preserved from the Carnegie Library and incorporated into the foyer of the new library. At the time of its completion in 1973, Canadian Architect wrote of the project: \\"In the middle of this urban desert, George Bemi‚Äôs Ottawa Public Library sits as an unexpected and welcome relief\\".The Ottawa Public Library, The Canadian Architect Dossier, Dec 1974, 42-46. The white, precast concrete stands in contrast to the surrounding glass office towers and preserves the identity of the library. Due to its compact nature it became the first building in North America to lease its air rights, a controversial legal problem at the time. It is once again the subject of debate over its size. Critics of the library say it is too small, outdated, and inaccessible to function as the main library branch. While proponents of the building claim that it is Ottawa‚Äôs best surviving example of Brutalist architecture. =Ottawa Congress Centre= The Ottawa Congress Centre was designed by a consortium of Bemi, Pye, and Richards Architects Associated and was opened by Pierre Elliot Trudeau in 1983. It was a tight design problem, bounded by a bridge to the South, Daly Street to the North, and the Rideau Centre to the East. Situated on the former railway lands, the project was part of a revitalization initiative for the downtown core. The building itself was Brutalist style architecture, consisting of intersecting terraces of textured concrete. It was lauded for its integration into the site and the inclusion of public artworks, containing a mural by the Canadian artist David Gerry Partridge. The Ottawa Congress Centre was demolished between 2008 and 2009 and a new Convention Centre, designed by Brisbin Brook Beynon Architects (BBB Architects), is scheduled to open in 2011. =Terry Fox Elementary School= Designed in 1979, the Terry Fox Elementary School was an exploration in plug- in, plug-out architecture. The main hub of the school was fixed, while the classroom wings were prefabricated, detachable units that could be added to the hub as the school‚Äôs population increased. At the time, the Ottawa School Board was expanding rapidly and many students were being taught in temporary, portable structures. The design was awarded the American Association of School Administrators‚Äô Educational Design Award for its innovative attempt to create flexible, portable classrooms that are simultaneously comfortable and aesthetic.

He was proud of, and fostered, his son's musical talent: but he was also extravagant, and died in debt, beginning the cycle of family indebtedness which eventually led to his eldest grandson Richard selling Dangan 40 years later.
