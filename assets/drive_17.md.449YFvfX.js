Fundación Proacceso’s main project is the RIA (Red de Innovación y Aprendizaje), or Learning and Innovation Network, a group of digital inclusion centers that offer access to computers, the Internet and quality education.México ¡bravo!, June 3, 2010  Background  The Fundación Proacceso was created in 2008, and since then it has overseen the rapid growth and success of the RIA centers.La tecnología apoya a la educación, CNN Expansion, December 24, 2009 Its first year of operation, more than 68,000 users registered at the initial ten RIA centers. Today, the RIA network consists of 70 digital inclusion and educational centers in 55 municipalities throughout Mexico. The RIA centers offer courses on basic computer and Internet skills, English, finding work through the Internet, math and science for children, programming, photography, personal finance and more. Students can also obtain their high school, bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the RIA through an online educational platform. The Fundación Proacceso also designed 21 educational video games for the Ministry of Public Education in Mexico (SEP).  Educational Architecture and Urban Acupunture  The RIA centers and the Digital Libraries act as community spaces for shared learning and as part of the online global culture. Due to their modular and environmental architecture they were included in the OECD’s 4th Compendium of Exemplary Educational Facilities. OECD's 4th Compendium of Exemplary Educational Facilities Designed by Ludens, the RIA centers provide an environment conducive to learning through spaces that are sustainable, comfortable, secure and strategically located. The registration desks and the interior walls are built with a modular design that allows them to be easily moved, opened and closed or disassembled when changing the configuration of a center. Moreover, in order to minimize waste, the dimensions of the modules are based on the materials’ industrial measurements; this way, little to no material goes unused. The location of each RIA center is determined through an \\"urban acupuncture\\" process that analyzes population density, income levels, educational attainment levels, the location of schools and major transportation routes. This process has aided to maximize the impact of its projects. Each RIA center benefits an average of 10.7 schools in a radius of 2 kilometers and provides services to an average of 5,000 users per year. The Digital Libraries focus on the target population by being inside public schools and combining digital learning tools, fostering reading skills and providing cultural services.  Results and Impact Assessments  In seven years of operation, the projects of the Fundación Proacceso have reached more than 1,000,000 users from all ages of which more than 410,000 users have graduated from its courses. In 2011 the educational impact of Expedición RIA was evaluated by C230, a third party organization that specializes in econometrics and educational impact evaluations. The study concluded that the program Expedición RIA positively impacted children's performance by 8% in Math and by 7% in Spanish. In 2013, EGMA, an assessment designed by USAID and translated by Fundación Proacceso, was used to assess the program and demonstrated a positive impact on children's performance of 2 standard deviations, equivalent to that of a good teacher. Additionally, a Social Return on Investment (SROI) Report was conducted by students from the Wharton School of Business from the University of Pennsylvania. The study used the strictest methodology for an SROI and concluded that: For every $1 invested in the RIA, a total of $1.84 was generated in economic growth; and that women who finished the computing route at the RIA have 4 times more chances of finding work.

Types of mayoralty =Council-Manager= Under council–manager government, the mayor is a first among equals on the city council, analogous to a head of state for the city. He or she may chair the city council, lacking any special legislative powers, but in most cases able to set the legislative agenda. The mayor and city council serve part- time, with day-to-day administration in the hands of a professional city manager. The system is most common among medium-sized cities from around 25,000 to several hundred thousand, usually rural and suburban municipalities. =Mayor-Council= In the second form, known as mayor–council government, the mayoralty and city council are separate offices. Under a strong mayor system, the mayor acts as an elected executive with the city council functioning with legislative powers. He or she may select a chief administrative officer to oversee the different departments. This is the system used in most of the United States' large cities, primarily because mayors serve full-time and have a wide range of services that they oversee. In a weak mayor or ceremonial mayor system, the mayor has appointing power for department heads but is subject to checks by the city council, sharing both executive and legislative duties with the council. This is common for smaller cities, especially in New England (where most towns do not even have mayors at all). Charlotte, North Carolina and Minneapolis, Minnesota are two notable large cities with a ceremonial mayor. Titles Many American mayors are styled as \\"His/Her Honor\\" while in office.

He was the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University from 1995 to 1999. Rasnick's 1995 team was the last Eastern Michigan Eagles football team to finish with a winning record until the 2016 season, 21 years later. Early years Rasnick was born on September 15, 1959, to Jim and Donna Rasnick. He has a younger sister, Kendahl, born in 1963, and a younger brother, Ryan, born in 1967. According to Rasnick, \\"Sports was always a family deal\\", with both brothers playing basketball, Little League baseball, and Pop Warner football while Kendahl was a cheerleader and their parents either coached or cheered from the sidelines. Rasnick was the starting center for the San Jose State Spartans football team in 1981 and 1982. Coaching career =Assistant coaching= After graduating, Rasnick stayed at his alma mater, first working as a graduate assistant, then becoming the offensive line coach until 1986. In 1987, he became the team's offensive coordinator for four years. When head coach Claude Gilbert was fired following the 1989 season, Rasnick served as the team's interim head coach for several months during the off-season, and he was a finalist for the permanent head coach position. When Terry Shea was hired to take over at San Jose State, Rasnick became the offensive coordinator for the Utah Utes, where he remained for four seasons, from 1991 through the end of the 1994 season. Even from the beginning of his time at Utah, Rasnick was being considered for head coaching positions; Idaho State University contacted him following the 1991 season. During his time at Utah, the team consistently featured one of the nation's top offenses, and Rasnick was considered largely responsible for this success. =Eastern Michigan= On January 3, 1995, Rasnick was interviewed by Eastern Michigan, and the following day he was hired as head coach with a five-year contract. Rasnick brought a more open, pass-oriented offense to Eastern Michigan than his predecessor, Ron Copper had used. Rasnick's offense featured Charlie Batch as quarterback in 1995 and 1997; Batch sat out 1996 with an injury. During his time at Eastern Michigan, Rasnick's recruiting noticeably favored junior- college transfers rather than high school seniors. On November 16, 1999, three days after a 29–26 loss at Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan athletic director Dave Diles, Jr. held a press conference to announce that he had fired Rasnick as head coach. Diles announced that defensive coordinator Tony Lombardi would serve as the interim head coach for the final game of the season, four days later, against Northern Illinois, saying, \\"I felt it was best to make a change at this time to begin an immediate search for a new head football coach. After undergoing a very thorough and comprehensive assessment of our football program I'm convinced that Rick Rasnick is not the person to take our football team to a Mid-American Conference championship level.\\" Rasnick was the Eastern Michigan head coach for five seasons, from 1995 until 1999, compiling a record of 20–34.

Then, both sides of the dhebra are streamed with vegetable oil on a tava, until small brown spots appear. This is a plain dhebra, made of millet flour (bajra atta).

He was the former PSC Director of the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation. Working on behalf of the government of Bangladesh, he oversaw all energy production treaties with various foreign energy companies, including Enron Corporation, Niko Resources, and Tullow Oil. Abedin initiated the $230 million deal with Unocal Corporation (now Chevron Corporation) in 2004, after getting approval from Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. He was also a senior National committee member for International Clean Cities program of the United States Department of Energy in Bangladesh. Bangladesh was getting very polluted due to extreme use of fuels. In 2001, Abedin was the first to initiate the national plan to decrease the use of using liquid fuels, by introducing natural gas conversion. He thought if cars could be converted to use cooking gas instead of rather harmful fuels, the carbon emission would decrease exponentially.M. Raihanul Abedin. Use of CNG as an Alternative Fuel for Transport-Air Pollution Control Perspective (2001) p.49-54, International Seminar on Air Pollution in Dhaka City, 30 October 2001; France Bangladesh Association of Scholars and Trainees (FBAST)] He was given the permission by the Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to carry out his plans. As a result, Asian Development Bank funded his scheme and today more than 80% of Bangladeshi vehicles are run on gas which has lessened pollution significantly. Abedin then served as the managing director of Water Supply and Sewerage System operations of the government of Bangladesh, during the military-supported government of Bangladesh in 2007. He was forced to resign once the ruling party took power in the 2009 national elections when the newly formed government sued top officials of the old regime. Abedin, during whose time WASA was expanded from six to 11 zones was called in the Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives (LGRD) Ministry in April 2009 and asked to resign immediately due to nepotism, according to the new Government. Inquiries later suggested that it was just a scheme for him to abandon his post as the head of Dhaka Wasa. As a former high official of State-Owned Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited (RPGCL) Abedin was sued twice by the government on his birthday in 2008.Staff Correspondent ACC sues 7 top RPGCL officials for Tk 11cr graft (12 March 2008) The Daily Star The allegations were, however, false. RPGCL claimed that there was a corruption of BDT 15.3 million; however, the company RPGCL did not have an overall worth of BDT 10 million (around US$120,000) at that time, so the allegations weren't sensible.  Personal background  Abedin was born in East Pakistan to a family of dewans in Comilla, who were chief ministers to the Kings of Tripura in their capital at Comilla. He attended the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (then known as East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology), where he studied mechanical engineering, graduating in 1970. He was an Army Scholar. During his time in BUET, he was the President of Awami League Chatro League. He also led the Choi Dofa Andalon from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. He married Shamsun Nahar, a member of the Munshibari family of Comilla. Nahar was the older sister of authors Kamrun Nahar and Saleh Uddin. He has two daughters, Shehnaz Raihan Abedin (Jenny) and Nowrin Raihan Abedin, and a son, Mohammad Rafatul Abedin (Rafat).Profile of Major Raihanul Abedin Retired Army Officers Welfare Association = Military background = In March 1973, Abedin was commissioned in the East Pakistan Army, then later the newly formed Bangladesh Army, where he served alongside Sheikh Kamal, son of former President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of Bangladesh. In February 1984, he retired from the military, ranked a Major to work in the private sector.  Professional background  = Occidental Petroleum and Unocal (Chevron) = Abedin personally initiated the $230 million (£123.9m) deal with Unocal Corporation (now Chevron Corporation) in 2004, on behalf of Bangladesh, after getting approval from the Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. This was at the Bibiyana field, which was located roughly around 180 miles north- east of the capital Dhaka, and had a reserve of 2.4 trillion cubic feet of gas; it was found by Unocal in 1998. When asked about the 1997 blowout of the Magurchhara gas field, caused by Occidental Petroleum (later taken over by Chevron) and the resulting $6.12 billion suit against Chevron Corporation, (of which only TK 380,000,000 was paid in damages) and why nothing was done of it, he said \\"Ask the government\\". He also received objection letters from Tullow Oil, when they objected the sell out of Chevron Texaco interests to Niko Resources and the Government of Bangladesh. = Niko Resources = Between 2003 and 2006, Niko Resources was possibly involved in a corruption scandal involving the $750 million Tengratila and Feni gas fields in Bangladesh (the company accidentally caused an explosion, initially refused to pay for damages and gave the Minister responsible for overseeing compensation claims an expensive vehicle; Niko eventually did compensate the 620 affected families). Investigation into corruption allegations were made by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in January 2009. Blowout or failure of equipments are generally out of human control and scope. Most planned and prepared operations can fail against response from Mother Nature. In an attempt to blackmail the government of Bangladesh, Niko Resources suspended gas supply from the Feni gas field, Abedin sharply reacted by saying that they (Petrobangla under Bangladesh) might be constrained to take serious steps under the laws of Bangladesh. Abedin formally claimed compensations from Niko Resources, after both Begum Khaleda Zia, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and the Energy Advisor approved it. In his letter, Abedin outline Niko's duty to supply three billion cubic feet (BCF) of gas free of cost for burning the same amount of gas in Tengratila, and also compensate Petrobangla for another 5.89 BCF of gas burnt at the sub-surface level. The letter also sought Tk 840 million as compensation for damage to environment, after Niko paid Tk 25 million to the local people. Later, Abedin met with President and CEO of Niko Resources at the Energy Division meeting along with the Energy Secretary to resolve pending issues. =Rexwood-Oakland= Petrobangla was later allegedly involved in a non-bid negotiation with US Based joint venture of Oakland-Rexwood, the latter stating that it would invest $60 million. In 1998 and 1999, Enron Corporation was also selected for the blocks alongside Oakland, where Enron proposed 80 percent share for themselves, and the rest for Oakland. The High Court of Bangladesh, placed a ban on signing any Production sharing agreement with any international oil company in December 2001, the same year that Enron Corporation went bankrupt for the Enron scandal. Production sharing agreement head, Abedin outright rejected the notion, saying it was just a visit to the National Energy Sector, adding that they did not have a specific proposal. The Oakland-Rexwood blocks were later operated by Tullow Oil. = Water Board Authority and Development = After Petrobangla, Abedin was made the managing director of the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA), by the military- backed government of Bangladesh. He was given charge of the sector when ammonia and other impurities concentrations were severely high, which resulted in his taking an initiative to set a pre-treatment plant for controlling the ammonia concentration. It was to be supervised by Danish International Development Agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Denmark and funded by Asian Development Bank. He also talked about the World Bank-funded sewage treatment facility that improves water conditions. The national board was already on the deep end of the water shortage, by at least 350 million litres, with the demand for the Metropolitan capital of Dhaka being around 2 billion L. The national electricity crisis of the power grid was a major problem, as due to low voltage and frequent blackouts, maximum capacity could not be delivered. Raihanul Abedin was shocked by the previous paper works. Dhaka had a population of over 6 million but Dhaka Wasa had only 150 thousand customers. This proved why Dhaka Wasa was suffering from major losses in revenue since the beginning of time. Abedin took that into mind and founded a team that will go from house to house and inquire about their and water supplies. By the time Abedin resigned from his post, Dhaka Wasa's revenue went up by almost 300% and for the first time in the history of Dhaka Wasa, it was a profitable organisation. There were many complaints that there wasn't sufficient water to fulfill the basic demands of the public of Dhaka so Abedin devised a plan to construct another water treatment plant. After hearing negative comments from many experienced and influential people such as \\"no one could do it in the last 20 years and no one can do it now, just relax and let things be as it is\\", Abedin took nothing into importance and devised a plan to get the job done. He contacted World Bank for funds and after the approval came from World Bank, he gained the approval of the Chief Advisor. After three years the plans were passed, the construction for the new phase is currently under way. Abedin's dream to fulfill the demands of the public is actually coming true. He was asked by a journalist whether he would mind if his name wouldn't be mentioned in this project and he replied kindly, \\"I did this for the good of the public, I just did my job, and seeing the public pleased is all I could ever want. Cutting a red ribbon is not a big deal\\". Health issues became a concern, once researchers and studies found that various chemical concentrations were found to be ten times higher than the standards set by World Health Organization. This, according to the board was due to the disposal of industrial effluents that no government board monitored regularly at the time. In 2008, the online billing system was introduced for the utility board and it heralded mixed signals from the citizens mainly because of spotty Internet services and in 2009, WASA increased water tariff by 20 percent, only after a month after a five percent increase in tariff. He said that it was due to frequent power outage, which is why pumps have to be often run by generators, which is contributing to a rise in water lifting cost. By mid 2009, the water crisis was so large and widespread, that WASA decided to transport tanks of water on trucks to major areas of the capital. Earlier the same month, he said that \\"due to dependence on deep tube wells, water layers in the city are dropping around three metres a year on average\\" about the excessive use of underground water of the capital through around a thousand illegal deep tube wells, and filling up of low-lying land, canals and water bodies are causing the underground water level to drop alarmingly. Various researchers say that this could put the citizens in severe water crisis in the future and also cause land to subside. As a result, the capital braced for one of their history's worst water logging problems, that Abedin believed was resulted from unauthorised buildings being built on land filled up from ponds and lakes. He also brought attention to more than a 100,000 illegal links in the national water supply network which costs the nation around Tk 350 million a year. Before his resignation from the post, Abedin proposed the government to take measures to use the alternative sources of water like rainwater, constructing sufficient water reservoir around the capital and setting up of wastewater and effluent treatment plants. Oliver Twist – SWAT fiasco On 29 July, Abedin filed the case with Gulshan Police Station after a burglary at his house in Gulshan during which thieves stole a laptop, three digital cameras and two cell phone sets. Given his prominence, instead of regular police officers, the elite SWAT team followed the leads in the case. The investigation lead to the discovery of a network of young burglars who were street urchins. The media reported that this case was like that of Oliver Twist- Charles Dickens noted work. Resignation On 8 April 2009, Abedin resigned from his position and a Joint Secretary from the Ministry of Local Government Rural Development (LGRD) of Bangladesh was a temporary replacement for him, before the newly elected government chose another suitor. The new government filed a case that had Abedin allegedly occupying a state palatial residence, corruption and nepotism in appointment, promotion and transfer; unauthorised use of various official cars; use of staff for personal purposes. He also allegedly hired 331 employees with bribes, all from his ancestral region, Comilla. In addition, two deputy managing directors out of four, two additional chief engineers, two out of ten superintending engineers and most of those on muster roll were also from Comilla. It was later discovered that allegations regarding promoting or hiring employees from his ancestral region was decided by the WASA board. He was blamed for living in the \\"WASA chairman House\\" located in Gulshan. He claimed that the house was meant for the CEO of Dhaka WASA, which was the managing director. He said that the house was built in the late 80s and early 90s and at that time the house was named WASA chairman House and the post of the managing director was called chairman. Upon request from the World Bank and various other foreign organisations, the name was changed to managing director. He said, \\"there is also a post called Board chairman but it is not to be confused with the CEO\\". In response, Abedin said that according to the WASA Act of 1996, he is entitled to live in the palatial complex, as he took initiatives during the caretaker government to retrieve a six bigha palatial house of WASA in Gulshan, which had been rented out to people without any legal authority. \\"A government residential house cannot be rented out,\\" he added. After Abedin resigned, the charges disappeared. He concluded by saying \\"A certain group influenced some of media people to publish baseless reports about me with a malicious intention.\\"  References  External links * Raihanul Abedin profile at Retired Army Officers Welfare Association Category:Bangladesh Army officers Category:Bangladeshi engineers Category:Living people Category:1949 births Category:Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology alumni ","title":"Raihanul Abedin"},{"id":"30508414","text":"Hapuwala is a village in Sri Lanka.

An ARkStorm (for atmospheric river 1,000 storm) is a hypothetical but scientifically realistic \\"megastorm\\" scenario developed and published by the Multi Hazards Demonstration Project (MHDP) of the United States Geological Survey, based on historical occurrences. It describes an extreme storm that could devastate much of California, causing up to $725 billion in losses (mostly due to flooding), and affect a quarter of California's homes. The event would be similar to exceptionally intense California storms that occurred between December 1861 and January 1862, which dumped nearly 10 feet of rain in parts of California, over a period of 43 days. The name \\"ARkStorm\\" means \\"atmospheric river (AR) 1,000 (k)\\" as the storm was originally projected as a 1-in-1000-year event. The USGS sediment research in the San Francisco Bay Area, Santa Barbara basin, Sacramento Valley, and Klamath Mountain region have indicated that \\"megastorms\\" similar to the ARkStorm scenario have occurred in the following years A.D.: 212, 440, 603, 1029, c. 1300, 1418, 1605, 1750, 1810, and December 1861–January 1862 (the latest occurrence). Based on the intervals of known occurrences, ranging from 51 to 426 years, scientists have concluded that these events have a mean return period of around 150–200 years. Geologic evidence also indicates that several of the previous events were more intense than the one in 1861–62, particularly the events in 440, 1418, 1605, and 1750, each of which deposited a layer of silt in the Santa Barbara Basin more than one inch thick. The largest event was the one in 1605, which left behind a layer of silt two inches thick, indicating that this flood was at least 50% more powerful than any of the others recorded. The floods more intense than the 1861–62 event appear to occur at intervals of 200 years or so. Description 1861–1862 ARkStorm event If the ARkStorm scenario were to occur, it would have the following effects: * The Central Valley would experience flooding long and at least wide. * Serious flooding also would occur in Orange County, Los Angeles County, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay area, and other coastal communities. * Wind speeds in some places would reach . * Hundreds of landslides would damage roads, highways, and homes. * Property damage would exceed $300 billion, most from flooding. * Demand surge (an increase in labor rates and other repair costs after major natural disasters) could increase property losses by 20 percent. * Agricultural losses and other costs to repair lifelines, drain flooded islands, and repair damage from landslides, could bring the total direct property loss to nearly $400 billion. * Power, water, sewer, and other lifelines would experience damage that could take weeks or months to restore. * Up to 1.5 million residents in the inland region and delta counties would need to evacuate due to flooding. * Business interruption costs could reach $325 billion, in addition to the $400 billion required for property repair costs, meaning that an ARkStorm could cost a total of $725 billion, nearly three times the amount of damage predicted by the \\"California ShakeOut\\", a hypothetical Southern California earthquake with roughly the same annual occurrence probability.

A clock tower used as a rappel tower has all four clock faces set to 9:11. History The Muscatatuck Urban Training Center is located on the grounds of the former Muscatatuck State Developmental Center (MSDC). MSDC was created in 1920 as the Indiana Farm Colony for the Feeble Minded. It became one of Indiana's largest mental institutions approximately 3,000 patients and around 2,000 employees. From 1920 through 2005, MSDC housed many of Indiana's challenged citizens and was once the largest employer in Jennings County. In 1997, Indiana lawmakers passed a plan to reorganize the state's health plan. Modern methods of mental illness treatment shrank its patient population down to about 1200, and in 2001, Governor Frank O'Bannon announced that the state would close Muscatatuck. Governor Mitch Daniels passed control of the facility to the Indiana National Guard in July 2005. In 2015 computer security expert Walter O'Brien presented ScenGen and other artificial intelligence technology, deployed at Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, to SOCOM at Muscatatuck.

Lavandula latifolia, known as broadleaved lavender, spike lavender or Portuguese lavender, is a flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to the western Mediterranean region, from central Portugal to northern Italy (Liguria) through Spain and southern France. Hybridization can occur in the wild with English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia). The scent of Lavandula latifolia is stronger, with more camphor, and more pungent than Lavandula angustifolia scent. For this reason the two varieties are grown in separate fields.

J. Kutsch and Leo Riemens, Francke, 1975) was a German operatic tenor and actor who had an active career in Germany and Austria during the first half of the 20th century. He made recordings for several record labels during the early years of the recording industry, including His Master's Voice, Odeon Records, Polydor Records, Tri-Ergon, and Vox Records. On the stage he sang a variety of roles in operas and operettas from leading parts to comprimario roles. His stage repertoire included Belmonte in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Chapelou in Adolphe Adam's Le postillon de Lonjumeau, Count Almaviva in Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Daniel in Franz Lehár's The Merry Widow, the Duke of Mantua in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto, Gabriel von Eisenstein in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus, Indigo in Strauss' Indigo und die vierzig Räuber, Jeník in Bedřich Smetana's The Bartered Bride, Paolino in Domenico Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto, Pâris in Jacques Offenbach's La belle Hélène, Pietro in Franz von Suppé's Boccaccio, and Wilhelm Meister in Ambroise Thomas' Mignon. Bötel was the son of tenor Heinrich Bötel. He began his voice training with Mathieu Lorent in Hamburg, and later continued his studies with Ernst Grenzebach in Berlin. He made his professional stage debut in 1905 at Theater Aachen as Lancelot in Edmond Audran's La poupée. From 1906 until 1910, he was committed to the Komische Oper Berlin where he was lauded for his portrayal of the title role in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann. From 1909 to 1911, he sang in several operettas at the Theater an der Wien; most notably creating the role of Armand Brissard in the world premiere of Lehár's Der Graf von Luxemburg in November 1909. From 1912 to 1914, he was committed to the Raimund Theater in Vienna, and in 1914–1915 he was a member of the Halle Opera House. He spent the next two decades performing roles from the tenor buffo repertoire at the Berlin State Opera. In 1917, he created the lead tenor role of Hans in the premier of Jugend by Ignatz Waghalter at the Deutsche Opernhaus in Berlin. He also appeared at the Kroll Opera House from 1928 to 1931 and frequently as a leading tenor in operettas in Berlin opposite soprano Fritzi Massary. He retired from the stage in 1935. Bötel also occasionally worked as a dramatic actor and appeared in three silent films during his career: Martha (1916), Rheinzauber (1920), and Trick-Track (1921).

The company said it sold 8.42 million shares, corresponding to a 13% share in the company, at a price of 275 rubles ($9.59) per share, raising a total of $80.7 million, and said that it was planning to use the money to finance new stores.

Via the purchase, Sedmoi Kontinent gained 29,500 square meters of trading space and 12 stores in the region. By April 2008, Sedmoi Kontinent had 133 stores, most of them in the Moscow Region. The company's revenue in 2007 was $1.27 billion with a net profit of $99.2 million. In February 2009, the French retail company Carrefour made an offer for 74.8% stake in Sedmoi Kontinent. Carrefour estimated the market value of Sedmoi Kontinent as $1.25 billion.

Other houses were demolished and apartment buildings were built instead. The most important street in Boa Vista is Anita Garibaldi Street.

It was described to be in the style of an \\"overly dramatic telenovela\\" and tells the story of Armando Álvarez, who must save his father's ranch from a powerful drug lord. Casa de mi padre was released on March 16, 2012. Plot Armando Álvarez (Will Ferrell) has lived and worked on his father's ranch in Mexico his entire life. As the ranch encounters financial difficulties, Armando's younger brother Raúl (Diego Luna), shows up with his new fiancée, Sonia (Génesis Rodríguez). It seems that Raúl's success as an international businessman means the ranch's troubles are over as he pledges to settle all debts his father has incurred. But when Armando falls for Sonia, and Raúl's business dealings turn out to be less than legitimate, all hell breaks loose as they find themselves in a war with Mexico's most feared drug lord, the mighty Onza (Gael García Bernal). Cast *Will Ferrell as Armando Álvarez, heir to a Mexican ranch. *Gael García Bernal as Onza, a Mexican drug lord. *Diego Luna as Raúl Álvarez, Armando's younger brother. *Génesis Rodríguez as Sonia Lopez, Raúl's fiancée. *Pedro Armendáriz Jr. as Señor Álvarez, the father to Armando and Raúl. *Nick Offerman as DEA Agent Parker. *Efren Ramirez as Esteban. *Adrian Martinez as Manuel.

Production In August 2010, Emilio Diez Barroso and Darlene Carmaño Loquet of NALA Films announced that they were teaming up with Will Ferrell, Adam McKay, Kevin Messick, and Jessica Elbaum of Gary Sanchez Productions to produce the Spanish-language comedy, Casa de mi padre, starring Will Ferrell. NALA Films was to finance the project; it was set to start filming in September 2010 in California. Producer Darlene Caamano Loquet stated, \\"We are just thrilled he [Ferrell] is on board and are moving full steam ahead since we have one month to teach him Spanish\\". In October 2010, it was reported that Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna had joined the cast along with Génesis Rodríguez, Pedro Armendáriz Jr., Héctor Jiménez, and Adrian Martinez. Bernal will play a family friend, Luna will play Ferrell's brother and Rodriguez will play Ferrell's love interest. Matt Piedmont, a frequent collaborator with Will Ferrell, was named as the film's director. It was also reported that the plot will be told in an overly dramatic telenovela style and feature English subtitles. In January 2011, a synopsis of the plot was released along with a report that the title changed to Untitled Spanish Comedy. However, in April 2011, a teaser trailer for the film was released under the name Casa de mi padre. The film was shot in 24 days on a budget of about $6 million.  Release In November 2011, Pantelion Films, a joint venture between Lions Gate Entertainment and Televisa, acquired the rights to distribute the film in the United States and set a release date of March 16, 2012. Upon release, the film played on 368 screens, a \\"fraction of what Mr. Ferrell’s movies typically receive.\\" Televisa gave NALA Films approval over all aspects of the film's $8 million marketing campaign which was spent mostly on advertisements on TV networks such as Univision, a partly Televisa owned company. The U.S. premiere was held on Wednesday, March 14, 2012, at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.

The soundtrack was engineered and mixed by Dana Nielsen.AllMusic Credits: Casa de Mi Padre SoundtrackCD Universe: Casa de Mi Padre Soundtrack A cover of \\"Fight For Love\\" was later self-released by guitarists John Frusciante and Omar Rodríguez-López in November 2015.  Reception  =Box office= Casa de mi padre opened on March 16, 2012, and despite playing in only 382 locations, the film debuted in ninth place in its opening weekend and earned $2,200,000; an average of $5,759 per locale. According to exit polling the audience was 51% male and 68% Hispanic. The film closed in theatres on May 17, 2012, grossing $5,909,483 in the United States and $8,041,667 worldwide. =Critical reaction= Casa de mi padre has received mixed reviews from film critics. Metacritic assigned the film an average score of 52/100 based on reviews from 32 film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 42% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.3/10, based on an aggregation of 103 reviews, and offers the consensus; \\"Thinly written and not as funny as it needs to be, Casa de mi padre would have worked better as a fake trailer or short film; stretched to feature length, it wears out its welcome far too quickly\\". Claudia Puig of USA Today declared, \\"This very funny spoof of telenovelas and classic Mexican westerns is decidedly offbeat and absurdly daffy\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Will Ferrell's performance, writing \\"Ferrell is a good straight actor for the same reason that he's an inspired comedian: He commits himself to every moment. Even in a movie whose highest ambition is to be true to its quaintly delectable tackiness\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times commented that \\"Casa de mi padre demands that you not take it seriously, and for the most part that's easy to do\\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter stated, \\"It makes sense that this Spanish-lingo farce plays very much like an SNL sketch. The only problem is that it packs about as many laughs into its 85 minutes as a good skit does in eight or 10\\". Justin Chang of Variety called it \\"a likable enough lark that rarely achieves outright hilarity\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times remarked, \\"The movie is only 84 minutes long, including credit cookies, but that is quite long enough\\".

The doctrine is often used in combination with other doctrines, such as substance over form. The doctrine is applied to prevent tax abuse, such as tax shelters or bailing assets out of a corporation. The step transaction doctrine originated from a common law principle in Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465 (1935), which allowed the court to recharacterize a tax-motivated transaction.  Application  The doctrine states: :interrelated yet formally distinct steps in an integrated transaction may not be considered independently of the overall transaction. By thus linking together all interdependent steps with legal or business significance, rather than taking them in isolation, federal tax liability may be based on a realistic view of the entire transaction.. There are three tests for applying the step transaction doctrine: (1) a binding commitment, (2) a mutual interdependence of steps, or (3) the intent of particular result. = Binding commitment test = The binding commitment test was established in Commissioner v. Gordon.. Under this strict test, a court will combine a series of separate steps if the parties had a formal obligation to complete each step. This test is applied usually when there are long periods of time between steps in the transaction. = Mutual interdependence test = The mutual interdependence test combines a series of events if the steps are so interdependent that the legal relations created by one transaction would have been fruitless without a completion of the series. = Intent test = The intent, or end result, test combines a series of closely related events that do not have independent purposes. If the intent of a step was merely to serve the next step, the court may consider the steps together. This test is more concerned with subjective intent of each step than the mutual interdependence test is.  Examples  *In Commissioner v. Court Holding Co., 324 U.S. 331 (1945) the Supreme Court affirmed the tax court's treatment of a liquidating dividend and sale by shareholder as a sale of the corporation.. *In Kimbell- Diamond Milling Co. v. Commissioner, 14 T.C. 74 (1950), the purchase of a corporation and subsequent liquidation were disregarded and treated as purchase of assets.

It is not actually a public holiday, as that requires an act of Congress. Its purpose is: > to provide Americans with one National day when they can just sit without > celebrating, observing or honoring anything. It is sponsored by Coffin's National Nothing Foundation, registered in Capitola, California. The third Monday of every January has subsequently been inaugurated as Martin Luther King Jr. Day which falls between the 15th and 21st. This means that one-in-seven January 16's now fall on a public holiday (e.g. Monday, 16th Jan 2012), effectively usurping the very nature of National Nothing Day. In contrast, the Realist Society of Canada (RSC) has a religious holiday called THABS ( \\"There has always been something\\" Day, pronounced ). THABS Day is dedicated to the celebration of \\"the realization that 'if there was ever nothing, there would be nothing now'\\".

It aired on January 17, 2011. Plot Everyone goes to St. Cloud, Minnesota, Marshall's hometown, to attend the recently deceased Marvin Eriksen's funeral. Marshall is devastated, while his mother Judy keeps herself distracted by doing chores, having not eaten or slept in two days. Lily offers to help Judy, which results in Judy yelling at her before taking a nap. Meanwhile, Robin amazes the gang, as well as other people at the funeral, by providing them with virtually everything they need out of her purse from mobile chargers to drugs. She soon runs into rough waters when she accidentally gives alcohol to Marshall's teenaged cousin. Lily takes the blame and faces Judy's outrage to let the latter vent all her emotions. Finally, an exhausted Judy eats and rests. Judy and Marshall learn that the funeral service will not be held by the Reverend, but by his son Trey (Danny Strong). The gang is surprised to learn that Trey used to bully Marshall in high school, especially since Trey is very short. Trey turns out to be extremely insensitive, though Judy agrees that Marvin Sr.'s last words should be the theme of the service. Marshall is reluctant to tell any such story as his last conversation with his father was over trivial issues, while the stories told by his mother and older brothers are very touching and inspiring. After charging his phone, which was out of power since before Marvin's death, Marshall discovers that he has a voicemail from his father. Marshall is wary about listening to the message, and asks the group what their father's last words to them would be should their fathers die; they realize that none of them would have anything special to say. Meanwhile, Ted and Barney unsuccessfully try to make Marshall laugh by showing him multiple videos of men getting hit in the groin in odd ways. During the service, after hearing stories told by Judy, Marcus, and Marvin Jr., Marshall's turn to speak at the memorial service comes. He impulsively goes out to hear his father's message, which appears to be a pocket dial. An outraged Marshall says how much his father meant to him and how unfair it is that his last message to him was a \\"pocket dial\\". However, as he continues to rant, Marvin's voice jokes about his pocket dial error, before telling Marshall that he enjoyed his visit, and finally telling him \\"I love you.\\"—and immediately asks for his foot cream as his rash had started to act up again. Deciding that his father's last words to him were \\"I love you\\", Marshall keeps his father's real last words to himself, instead telling everyone of how his father had told him to rent Crocodile Dundee 3. Judy thanks Lily for what she has done during the course of the wake while making one last crude joke at Lily's expense, stating that it will be the last time, apparently resolving their strained relationship. After reflecting on the service, Ted, Lily, and Robin call their fathers to have meaningful conversations with them. Meanwhile, Barney calls his mother and tells her that he is ready to meet his father. Production This is the first episode since the season one finale, \\"Come On\\", to not have a cold opening; instead, it starts with the opening credits. Eric Braeden was set to reprise his role as Robin's father, but backed out at the last minute, claiming that his cameo appearance was not \\"substantial\\" enough. This led to Neil Patrick Harris calling him out over Twitter, and Braedan later responding back in the media. The part was recast with Ray Wise. Chris Elliott reprises his role as Lily's father, but does not appear on-screen; his brief cameo just consists of a voiceover as Lily is talking to him over the phone. Carter Bays stated that they intended to bring back Bill Fagerbakke as Marshall's father in future episodes, but during flashbacks. He later appeared in several episodes. Danny Strong appears in this episode. Perhaps his best-known role is as Jonathan Levinson on Buffy the Vampire Slayer alongside Alyson Hannigan. Critical response Reviews for the episode were highly positive. Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, noting it \\"[u]npretentious, unobtrusive, funny, balanced, and shot through with genuine feeling and unexpected grace\\". Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.5 out of 10. He said the episode built up on Bad News' momentum and had more roles in store for the rest of the main characters, but criticized Barney and Ted's efforts to lighten up Marshall as weak and worse during a funeral. DeAnn Welker of Television Without Pity graded the episode at A. Henry Hanks of CNN.com's Marquee Blog compared the episode's impact to that of The Mary Tyler Moore Show episode \\"Chuckles Bites the Dust\\" and the first episode of NewsRadio after Phil Hartman's death in 1998. = Ratings = The episode achieved the highest ratings of season 6, at 10.51 million viewers.

During this period, many of the president's political opponents died in the camp.  Biography  Siaka Touré was born in 1935 in Kankan, and studied in Paris and Moscow. He was a nephew (or perhaps cousin) of the President, Sékou Touré. As such, he was also a descendant of Samori Ture. He became an army officer, and also served as Minister of Transport. After the Labé plot was announced by the government in February 1969, Captain Siaka Touré became a member of the three-person Revolutionary Committee along with the President and General Lansana Diané, the Minister of Defense. Siaka had a collection of cars which he confiscated at will, imprisoning those who had the arrogance to protest.  Operation Green Sea  During the coup attempt (\\"Operation Green Sea\\") of November 1970, when Portuguese troops and Guinean fighters invaded Conakry and seized Camp Boiro among other locations, Siaka managed to hide in the Camayenne hotel and avoid capture. After the coup attempt failed, many opponents of the regime were rounded up and imprisoned in Camp Boiro. Siaka Touré presented a mild-mannered facade during interrogations, often proposing to act as an intermediary between the prisoner and his family. He was the sole master of the camp, allowing nobody to enter or leave without his permission. During his long tenure, many political prisoners died, some executed, some as a result of torture, and some from the \\"diète noire\\", or \\"black diet\\", meaning that they received no food and no water.  Guinean Market Women's Revolt  In 1977, there was a demonstration in Conakry, called the Guinean Market Women's Revolt, staged by women complaining of regulations against private traders. Siaka Touré met the demonstrators with a detachment of troops, and when they failed to stop ordered the troops to open fire. One woman was killed and many others were arrested. After the death of Sékou Touré in March 1984, Siaka Touré was imprisoned by the military regime that took power. Following an attempted coup by Diarra Traoré in July 1985, he was executed along with other members of the former regime such as Ismaël Touré, Mamadi Keïta and Moussa Diakité.

The Creation Engine has been used to create role-playing video games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. Development The Creation Engine is a game engine created by Bethesda Game Studios. After using the Gamebryo engine to create The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and Fallout 3, Bethesda decided that Gamebryo's capabilities were becoming too outdated and began work on Creation Engine for their next game, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, by forking the codebase used for Fallout 3. Following the completion of Skyrim, Bethesda set out to enhance the graphical core of the Creation engine by first adding a physically based deferred renderer to allow for more dynamic lighting and to paint materials object surfaces with realistic materials. Bethesda worked with technology company Nvidia to implement volumetric lighting through a technique that makes use of hardware tesselation. Additionally the updated version of the Creation Engine powering Bethesda's Fallout 4 offers more advanced character generation. Shortly before the release of Fallout 4, while Bethesda Game Studios began development of Starfield and downloadable content for Fallout 4, what is currently Bethesda Game Studios Austin (at the time BattleCry Studios) was tasked with modifying the Creation Engine to support multiplayer content in preparation for the development of Fallout 76. In conjunction with id Software (like Bethesda Softworks a ZeniMax Media subsidiary), BattleCry attempted to integrate id's Quake netcode into Fallout 4's engine. This was considered a challenge by experts in the online game industry. A primary issue facing the developers was that components of the core engine (dating back to Gamebryo used in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind) such as quests or world loading were designed centering on a single player (dubbed \\"Atlas\\" by the developers for its role in holding up the fabric of the loaded game world), a paradigm that would need to fundamentally change to allow multiple players spanning multiple worlds. In addition to the network changes to the engine used in Fallout 4, the Fallout 76 implementation of the engine was described at the game's E3 reveal as having \\"all new rendering, lighting, and landscape technology\\". Bethesda Game Studios claims the improvements also allow for a 16× increase in detail and the ability to view unique weather systems occurring at a distance. Features * Havok Behavior is a flexible animation tool that allows the developers to blend animations together in a few clicks. This means that animations such as walking and running can be blended together seamlessly to make the animations look much more realistic. This important addition enabled Bethesda to improve character animations in their games. * An upgraded version of Radiant AI allows non-player characters (NPCs) to dynamically react and interact with the world around them. The player can observe an NPC eat breakfast, go to work, go to the pub, and then go to sleep. The improved AI allows NPCs to react to the player's actions and they can become friendly or hostile to the player because of their actions. * Radiant Story allows for NPCs to dynamically create new quests for the player in unexplored places. * In previous games, Bethesda licensed SpeedTree for trees and foliage, but when making Skyrim with Creation Engine, the Bethesda team made their own foliage rendering system. The new system is capable of rendering larger amounts of foliage at one time and allows for more freedom with animations. =Creation Kit= thumb The Creation Kit is a modding tool for Creation Engine games. The Creation Kit takes advantage of the Creation Engine's modular nature. It was created by Bethesda Game Studios for the modding community of The Elder Scrolls series. The tool can be used to create worlds, races, NPCs, weapons, update textures, and fix bugs. Mods created using this tool are hosted on the Steam Workshop, Nexus Mods, Bethesda.net and various other sites. A Fallout 4–compatible Creation Kit was released in April 2016.

Priced at 1d., the newspaper was selling 40,000 copies a week by 1836.

In 1836 the newspaper merged with Henry Hetherington's London Dispatch.

History of St. Francis Xavier Parish The mission was used as a base of operations by Nicolas Perrot in his explorations of the Upper Midwest in the 1680s.
