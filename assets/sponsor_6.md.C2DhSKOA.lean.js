It was plundered by the Aetolians in 200 BCE, was taken by Antiochus III, 191 BCE, but recovered by Marcus Baebius Tamphilus and Philip V of Macedon in the same year, and was attacked by Perseus of Macedon, following the surrender of nearby Doliche, Pythium, and Azorus in 171 BCE.

From 2006 to 2010, she was the executive director of the Ruckus Society. Much of her work as a writer is based around the writings of Octavia E. Butler. Her first book, Emergent Strategy, was published in 2017 to positive reviews. Her second book, Pleasure Activism: The Politics of Feeling Good, was published in 2019 and demonstrates how activists can tap into emotional and erotic desires to organize against oppression.  Early life and activism  Brown was born in El Paso, Texas, to a mixed-race couple who met at Clemson University in South Carolina. She is the eldest of three children. Her father was in the military and she spent much of her childhood abroad in Germany, as well as in Georgia, New York, and California. As mixed-race children, Brown and her sisters experienced racism in school. Brown attended Columbia University where she studied African American Studies, political science, and voice. She was at the university when Amadou Diallo was killed by police officers in 1999. She cites this time as being pivotal to the development of her political consciousness, especially regarding issues of policing and race. She identifies as bisexual and has recounted experiences with homophobia and sexual assault. She's been living in Detroit since 2009 where she moved to after being invited to consult with Detroit Summer in 2006 and also after dating Detroit-based rapper Invincible.  Later career  After graduating from Columbia, brown began working with the Harm Reduction Coalition in Brooklyn. She served as a social justice facilitator at the Social Forum and work with social justice organizations in Detroit. Of her work in Detroit, brown wrote, \\"Our actions have to be towards the world we want. We need to be guerilla gardening and turning people's heat and water on. We need to be the guerillas putting up solar panels in the hood. That's what Detroit has taught me.\\" Between 2006 and 2010, Brown also worked as the executive director of the Ruckus Society, and cofounder and director of the League of Young/Pissed Off Voters, as well as collaborating with Arctic Indigenous Youth Alliance. In 2006, Brown served as a consultant with Detroit Summer, based out of the Boggs Center. From this Brown developed a strong relationship with Grace Lee Boggs, whom she counts as a mentor. Brown was a major figure within the Allied Media Conference as a host and facilitator. Throughout her career, brown has typically supported Democrats in presidential elections, encouraging her readers to vote for Joe Biden and Barack Obama.  Writing  Brown previously contributed to Detroit-based newspaper The Michigan Citizen, and was a sex columnist for Bitch magazine. She has published extensively on sex, healing, self-care, trauma, and science fiction. In 2010, she published the Octavia Butler Strategic Reader with Alexis Pauline Gumbs. In 2013, she received a Detroit Knight Arts Challenge Award to run a series of Octavia Butler-based science fiction writing workshops. In 2015, she collaborated with Walidah Imarisha and Sheree Renee Thomas to edit and release Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements, a collection of 20 short stories and essays about social justice inspired by Butler. Her own writing style has been said to belong to the afrofuturism genre. Her first book, Emergent Strategy, was released in 2017 to critical acclaim. Brown's most recent anthology, Pleasure Activism: The Politics of Feeling Good was released in February 2019. In April 2019, it appeared on The New York Times' Bestsellers List for Paperback Nonfiction, where it was number six.

L.\\" Mackenzie (22 February 1833 ‚Äì 26 December 1899) was a leading Scottish medical missionary and minister for the Presbyterian Church of England who was revered by the church for his nearly four decades of service to their mission at Swatow. During his tenure at the mission he made numerous lasting contributions such as his translation of the scriptures into the local Swatow dialect, ensuring the accessibility of important religious works, and establishment of out-stations that greatly expanded the mission's reach. Outside of Swatow, Mackenzie founded the Taiwan Mission on behalf of the Presbyterian Church of England and was invited to speak at missionary conferences in an array of cities that included Philadelphia, Shanghai, and Bristol.  Early life and education  Mackenzie was born in Inverness, Inverness-shire, Scotland on February 22, 1833. He was also christened in Inverness soon thereafter on March 13, 1833. Mackenzie was the fourteenth youngest of the seventeen children of Thomas Mackenzie and Grace Fraser. Mackenzie graduated from The University and King's College of Aberdeen, which has been merged into what is now known simply as the University of Aberdeen, with a Master of Arts (MA) degree in March of 1854.King's College (University of Aberdeen). Officers And Graduates of University & King's College, Aberdeen MVD-MDCCCLX. Aberdeen: Printed for the New Spalding Club, 1893. He subsequently received his postgraduate theological training at New College in the University of Edinburgh, where he received his degree as a Doctor of Divinity (DD).  Personal life  Mackenzie married his wife, Mary Bailie, in 1871 in London‚Äôs Marylebone neighborhood.https://ancestrylibrary.proquest.com Mackenzie was joined by his wife in China after her arrival at Swatow in 1872. Bailie made numerous contributions to the mission that complemented her husband's work, such as her important role in the construction of a boarding school for girls in 1873. Additionally, Bailie often accompanied her husband in his day-to-day missionary functions.MRS, A. G.

Thomas, the youngest, was born in China and remained with his parents in Swatow.  Missionary work  = Work in Swatow = Mackenzie arrived at the Presbyterian Church of England‚Äôs foreign mission in Swatow in 1860 and aided in the construction of the mission‚Äôs main hospital, which was completed in 1863. The mission would eventually be expanded to contain a smaller hospital for overflow and a hospital designated for women, in addition to the main hospital. Among these three structures, the mission was able to handle thousands of patients per year.MacGillivray, D. (Donald), 1862‚Äì, and Christian Literature Society for China. A Century of Protestant Missions In China (1807‚Äì1907): Being the Centenary Conference Historical Volume. Shanghai: Printed at the American Presbyterian Mission Press, 1907. After the completion of the main hospital, Mackenzie began to establish out-stations in surrounding areas that brought more patients in contact with the mission, thereby exposing more Chinese to the gospel. The Swatow mission was constructed in such a way that it was built around a ‚Äúwell-equipped center‚Äù from which missionaries would ‚Äúwork outwards to surrounding counties,‚Äù thereby prompting Mackenzie to venture into unfamiliar areas that lacked requisite medical infrastructure. Mackenzie's work at the Swatow mission was highly Evangelistic; Mackenzie would travel to villages and the individual households within them to establish contact with the locals and preach the virtues of Christianity. Some of these locals would subsequently join Mackenzie in the English Presbyterian Mission, assisting Mackenzie and the other missionaries in spreading the gospel and providing medical care. For those who didn‚Äôt join the mission directly, Mackenzie still inspired Chinese Christians who took it upon themselves to build new churches, convert fellow Chinese, and influence missionaries to open new out-stations in underserved areas. A Mission Printing Press, which was established in 1880, published scriptures and other religious works in Swatow vernacular, which were subsequently printed and distributed. Mackenzie led efforts at the Printing Press to translate the scriptures into the Swatow dialect. Mackenzie worked across several decades, alongside other Reverends such as George Smith and J.C. Gibson, to translate the Epistles of John and Jude from the New Testament. For many years Mackenzie also contributed to the press's monthly publication, titled Church News. Mackenzie helped the mission to greatly expand its educational opportunities in Swatow during the 1870s: a girls‚Äô boarding school, theological college, and boys‚Äô middle school were opened in 1873, 1874, and 1876, respectively. Thanks in large part to this educational infrastructure, the Church institutions in Swatow were largely able to be staffed by Chinese ministers and teachers, allowing the foreign missionaries in Swatow to pursue other endeavors. = Founder of Taiwan Mission = Mackenzie successfully expanded the scope of the English Presbyterian Mission‚Äôs operations during his tenure as a missionary. In 1860, along with Carstairs Douglas, a fellow medical missionary of Scottish origin, Mackenzie identified the suitability of Taiwan as a mission field. At the discretion of Mackenzie, the English Presbyterian Foreign Missions Committee subsequently sent a number of ministers to Taiwan. The first of these ministers was James Laidlaw Maxwell, who settled in the city of Takow on May 29, 1865. The presence of a British consul in Takow helped to facilitate the establishment of this mission.A. Hamish Ion (21 September 2009). The Cross and the Rising Sun: The British Protestant Missionary Movement in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, 1865‚Äì1945. Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press. p. 19. = Other missionary endeavors = Mackenzie would periodically serve the Presbyterian Church of England in a non-medical capacity in regions outside his designated mission location of Swatow. On May 10, 1871, Mackenzie was invited to speak at ‚Äúa meeting in support of the Foreign missions of the Free Church of Scotland, and of the Presbyterian Church of England.‚Äù The event was held in Exeter Hall, Strand, London and featured numerous other missionaries from regions such as Bombay and Amoy. Sir D. F. MacLeod, the former Lieutenant Governor of Punjab in British India, presided over the meeting. Mackenzie was chosen to represent England at the Second General Counsel of the Presbyterian Alliance, which was held in Philadelphia. The Counsel lasted from September 23 to October 3, 1880 and welcomed any church organized on Presbyterian principles, featuring delegates from a variety of nations across the world, such as Australia and India. Members of Missionary Conference held at Shanghai in May, 1877 In recognition of his thirty-six years of dedicated service as a medical missionary for the Presbyterian Church of England, Mackenzie was appointed Moderator of a synod for the church in 1897. The synod was held at St. James' Presbyterian Church of England, Bristol and was intended to commemorate Rev. William C. Burns becoming the church‚Äôs first missionary to China when he arrived there in 1847. Burns also worked in Swatow for a time, from March of 1856 until October of 1858, though his tenure there did not overlap with that of Mackenzie. At the synod, Mackenzie spoke at length about his tenure in Swatow and was very well received by the clergy of the church. On May 17, 1877, Mackenzie featured at a missionary conference in Shanghai that included missionaries from a variety of fields who were working in China at the time. Mackenzie spoke after Rev. Frederick Foster Gough and gave his speech ‚ÄúOn the Duty of the Foreign Residents Aiding in the Evangelization of China‚Äîand the best means of doing so.‚Äù  Death and legacy  Mackenzie died while in Swatow on December 26, 1899. He was survived by his four children, though his wife had died several years earlier. Mackenzie was admired for his willingness to venture away from the center of the mission and out into surrounding areas, where he would provide medical assistance and spread the gospel to previously overlooked communities. Mackenzie persevered in his missionary work in spite of the absence of three of his children, who remained in Scotland, and the death of his wife, who passed away while accompanying Mackenzie at the Swatow mission. Mackenzie laid the groundwork for the continued development of the Swatow mission after his death, with an Anglo-Chinese college being constructed in 1905‚Äì06. His founding of the Taiwan Mission and translation of the scriptures into Swatow dialect were also accomplishments that would have a meaningful impact on future generations of Chinese.

This 150+ year old bank is one of the largest community banks in San Joaquin County. Bank of Stockton has 19 branches, in 16 cities, throughout 9 counties in contiguous markets in Northern California. Bank of Stockton is California's oldest bank still operating under its original charter.  Founders  On August 12, 1867, a Certificate of Incorporation of the Stockton Savings and Loan Society (Bank of Stockton's original name) was filed with the San Joaquin County clerk. It was only two years after the Civil War, and the first group of organizers, 29 in number, met at the office of the Union Copper Mining Company, in Stockton, California. The following gentlemen were Incorporators: P. E. Connor, O. M. Clayes, R. B. Lane, H. H. Hewlett, James Littlehale, E. Conklin, Chas. Belding, J. McMullen, J. B. Webster, Wm. Fogarty, A. W. Simpson, L. U. Shippee, James Taylor, H. B. Underhill, R. B. Smith, L. Howard, J. M. Kelsey, John Sedgwick, Samuel Miller, H. Dohrman, W. P. Miller, E. S. Pillsbury, Andrew McShane, B. W. Bours, Chas G. Hubner, L. M. Hickman, L. L. Howland, Timothy Paige and Thomas Volland. These 29 men were inspired to band together to provide the people of Stockton with order and strength for their financial needs. They pledged to raise $100,000 in U.S. gold coins with which to start the Bank. J. M. Kelsey was elected to serve as the first President. At that time, Mr. Kelsey was the San Joaquin County Treasurer and Tax Collector. He was also an Officer of the Union Copper Mining Company. James Littlehale, the Bank's first Cashier, was a City Treasurer from 1866 to 1874, operated a successful produce brokerage and was the Secretary- Treasurer at the Union Copper Mining Company. B. W. Bours came from a pioneer land and banking family in Stockton. L. U. Shippee, who later became the Bank's second President, was a major land owner in the county. Andrew W. Simpson was on the first Board of Directors and served as a Vice President for 54 years, from 1867 to 1921. Mr. Simpson came to Stockton in November 1851 and secured work in the lumber business with his brother. He was a member of the Weber Fire Engine Company and was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Chicago in 1888. He was succeeded by his son Andrew W. Simpson Jr., and at his death in 1945, Andrew Simpson III was elected to the Board. In 1868, another well-known local resident, Charles Haas joined the board. He served until 1911 and his son Charles J. Haas served until 1915. Charles Haas‚Äô grandson, R. Raymond Haas, served as a Director from 1937 to 1966. The men who founded the bank were self-made businessmen and well-respected community leaders.  Early Years  The first location of the Bank of Stockton was shared with the Union Copper Mining Company and the rent was a mere $41 per month. When bank business began on September 20, 1867, the Bank's founders had so much faith in the community and its people that they actually loaned money before the first deposit came in. The first loan of $1,000 was made and the following day the first commercial deposit was made by Jones, Hewlett & Sons. H. H. Hewlett was an owner of this business, as well as an original founder and Director of the Bank of Stockton. He was known as one of the most successful bankers on the Pacific Coast. Within the first 24 days of operation, the Bank had $100,000 worth of business. A large part of the early acceptance of the Bank was due to the reputation of the men who were its founders. The leading principles by which the bank operated had a great deal of meaning to depositors. A document, entitled \\"An Agreement with Depositors\\" pledged that the Bank's Board of Directors would use deposits to make loans and investments, but always with the safety of depositors to come before the profit of the Corporation. In 1875, Bank business had increased to the point where the original office was too small to provide sufficient service; consequently a ten-year lease was signed on December 30, 1875 for the rental of the McKee Building at the southwest corner of Hunter and Main. On February 1, 1876, the first meeting was held in the \\"New Banking House.\\" President Kelsey passed away on January 29, 1877 and on February 6, 1877, L. U. Shippee was elected President. Mr. Shippee served for a 16 years until 1893 and was responsible for bringing the first State Fair of California to Stockton. Fred M. West was elected Secretary in 1880 and later became President in 1893. President Fred West build upon the tradition of the Bank of Stockton's commitment to the community. West, also a County Treasurer, played a major role in bringing both the Santa Fe and Western Pacific Railroads to Stockton and was the first President of the Stockton Chamber of Commerce. On December 2, 1903, the Bank purchased the \\"Arcade Property\\" on the northeast corner of Main and San Joaquin for $75,000. On July 17, 1906, a special Meeting of the Stockholders authorized the expenditure of $250,000 to build a new bank. This new home for the Bank of Stockton was constructed on the northeast corner of Main and San Joaquin Street. \\"Stockton‚Äôs First Skyscraper\\" graced the paper as headlines, and it was the new Bank of Stockton that the community was talking about. The early years of the Bank of Stockton concluded with a span of father-son leadership. R.E. Wilhoit, elected to the Board in 1894, succeeded Fred M. West as President in September 1909. Having served his community as a County Supervisor, Recorder, City Council President and Board of Education President, R. E. Wilhoit exemplified the Bank of Stockton's philosophy of community involvement. In 1917, R.E. Wilhoit's son, Eugene L. Wilhoit took over as President and served until 1949. Eugene not only maintained, but augmented the prestige of the Wilhoit name in financial circles. When the Bank of Stockton was frequently referred to as the \\"Wilhoit Bank\\" it carried with it a ring of confidence and assurance to depositors and stockholders alike. The Bank of Stockton and Eugene Wilhoit were instrumental in bringing University of the Pacific (United States) to Stockton. In the early 1920s, Tully C. Knoles came to Stockton, with the purpose of arranging to move a small college to the Stockton area from San Jose, California. Tully called on Eugene Wilhoit, who had been a graduate of the College of Pacific on the San Jose campus and in 1922, was elected to C.O.P.‚Äôs Board of Regents. In 1924, Eugene Wilhoit and Tully Knoles formed a committee to help raise money to relocate the University from San Jose to Stockton. Once here, one of the first things the college needed was financial assistance, and Wilhoit strongly approved it. This enabled the College of Pacific, now the University of the Pacific, to move to Stockton.  Growth and Change  In 1949, R. L. Eberhardt became the sixth President of the Bank of Stockton. He graduated from the University of California in 1923 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He served in the U.S. Army, American Expeditionary Forces in WWI and became a Master Sergeant with numerous military honors. With experience as an accountant with Irvine & Muir Lumber Company in Willits, California, and experience as Assistant Cashier with Bank of Willits, he became a State Bank Examiner for the California State Banking Department. In 1927, he came to the Bank of Stockton as Assistance Vice President and Cashier. At that time, the Bank‚Äôs assets totaled $9,000,000. In 1931, he became Vice President and in 1936, he was elected to the position of Executive Vice President. He served in that position until 1949, when he was elected President of the Bank. R.L. was active in Civic Affairs, as shown by his many years on the Port Commission and County Fair Board. He also served as President of the California Bankers Association and was a long time Regent of the University of the Pacific. Much of the bank‚Äôs growth took place in the 36 years that he was associated with it. His crowning achievement was the Bank‚Äôs new Headquarters Office, completed in 1960, on the corner of Miner and San Joaquin Streets in Stockton. Thousands of people came to see \\"the most modern banking facility in the state.\\" R. L. Eberhardt served as President until 1963, when his son, Robert (Bob) Eberhardt, was named President. Bob graduated from the University of the Pacific in Stockton. After finishing his secondary education at the New Mexico Military Institute, Bob enrolled at UOP where he played football. Midway through the season, he was called by the Air Force to serve in the Azores and France. In 1952, Bob joined the California State Banking Department as an examiner. He remained an examiner until 1956, when he began working at the Bank of Stockton. In 1958, he was named to the Board of Directors, and in 1959, he was appointed Vice President and worked alongside his father. In 1963, following his father's death, he took the helm as President of Bank of Stockton, as well as President of the Independent Bankers Association of Northern California. That same year, he succeeded his father as a member of the Board of Regents at UOP. In 1969, at the age of 42, Robert M. Eberhardt became one of the youngest presidents of the California Bankers Association. As chairman of the Bankers Responsible Government Committee, he helped bring community banks together to give them a voice in legislation in order to compete with larger national banks. In 1968, President Eberhardt negotiated with Bessie Carson Gunton, the daughter of one of the Bank's original depositors, William McKendree Carson, for the purchase of land formerly owned by her father, where Pacific Avenue and Benjamin Holt Drive in Stockton are located today. This piece of land was purchased for the purpose of the Bank's first \\"Branch Office.\\" The Carson Oaks Office opened in 1970. The 1980s saw even more growth for the Bank, with the acquisition of Mid-Cal National Bank. The four new locations gave Bank of Stockton immediate branch representation throughout San Joaquin County with branches in Lodi, California, Tracy, California, Manteca, California, and Pine Grove, Amador County, California. On September 16, 1990, the Bank's Quail Lakes Delta Office opened in Stockton. Slow, cautious growth has been a tradition for Bank of Stockton. In May 1990, the opportunity arose for the Bank to acquire the deposits of Royal Oaks Savings and Loan. This acquisition created a new Ripon branch location for Bank of Stockton. In 1993, Bank of Stockton became the first bank on the west coast to introduce the then-innovative \\"Image Check System\\" which replaced cancelled checks with reduced images of checks. In 1990, Bob Eberhardt acquired the photograph collection of late Stockton photographer, Leonard Covello, with the purpose of preserving local history. The Bank of Stockton had many historic items and photos of its own in an existing collection. The Covello Collection, which dated back to 1850 and consisted of more than 21,000 historical images from the Central Valley (California), the Mother Lode and surrounding communities, was an opportunity that Eberhardt could not pass up. The entire collection is now scanned into a visual database. Since then, the Collection has grown to over 31,000 photographs. In the fall of 1994, President Robert M. Eberhardt passed away. The legacy of leadership, commitment and determination that Robert M. Eberhardt left behind continues to serve as a major component of Bank of Stockton's strength. The tradition of family leadership continued when Douglass M. Eberhardt took his seat as the bank's eighth President, pledging his commitment to the traditions and philosophies that made Bank of Stockton a success for well over century. Douglass Eberhardt graduated from the College of the Pacific in 1959 with a Major in Business Administration and a Minor in Economics. He is a 1966 graduate of the University of Washington Pacific Coast Banking School and a 1974 graduate cum laude of the School for Bank Administration, majoring in Controllership. He also served in the U.S. Army Reserves, Armor Corps. Eberhardt has served on University of the Pacific's Board of Regents and has been very involved in the progress and growth of the University's Eberhardt School of Business, named after the Eberhardt family in June 1997. Like his brother and father before him, Doug's involvement in the community included seats on numerous boards and affiliations. Eberhardt also saw opportunity in response to a growing customer base in the Manteca, California area, and built a new, larger Manteca office in the fall of 1997. On December 5, 1997, Bank of Stockton officially acquired three Bank of America branches, giving the bank representation in the new markets of Angels Camp in Calaveras County, and Rio Vista, California in Solano County. The acquisition included a large B of A office in Ripon, California that was soon remodeled and became the bank's main Ripon location. Marking another milestone in the bank's history, Bank of Stockton became the first community bank headquartered in the Central Valley to reach more than $1 billion in assets in May 1999. In February 2003, Bank of Stockton opened a new branch in the City of Oakdale, California. The following fall, the Bank acquired Modesto Commerce Bank and Turlock Commerce Bank as Divisions of Bank of Stockton. The additional branches added over $330 million in assets and increased the Bank's assets to approximately $1.75 billion. The acquisition expanded the Bank's branch network into Stanislaus County. On December 21, 2006, Elk Grove Commerce Bank, a Division of Bank of Stockton, opened its doors. On August 25, 2008, to better serve the growing customer base in Modesto, California, the Modesto Commerce Bank division opened its Dale Road branch. On March 1, 2009, Bank of Stockton announced its plans to purchase the Sonora, California Branch of Wachovia Bank. In the fall of 2015, the Bank acquired three new branches of First Bank, located in Brentwood, California, Napa, California, and Fairfield, California. This acquisition increased the Bank's assets to $2.4 billion and gave the Bank representation in Contra Costa County and Napa county with a second branch in Solano County. The acquisition brought the bank's branch footprint to 19 in 9 contiguous counties. In 2015, Douglass Eberhardt II was elected 9th President of the Bank of Stockton, with Doug Sr. continuing as CEO and Chairman of the Board. The younger Eberhardt was previously Executive Vice President working closely with his father for over twenty years. Douglass II is a 1989 business graduate of University of the Pacific. Douglass is the 4th Eberhardt in the Bank's history to be named to the position of President, preceded by his father, Douglass, his uncle Robert, and his grandfather, R.L. Eberhardt. He is the 9th President in the Bank's history of 150 years, continuing the span of Eberhardt leadership. In July 2016, the Bank decided to consolidate the names of its Divisions, Modesto Commerce Bank, Turlock Commerce Bank and Elk Grove Commerce Bank, into Bank of Stockton.

Opposing forces included the Union Army, and the Confederate Army. Important battles were fought at Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley.  Background  In 1860, Mobile was the South's fourth-largest city, and home to several shipbuilding companies. Until 1862 when the Union Army captured New Orleans, Mobile was the second-largest port city of the South. Mobile was a key hub for the cotton trade upon which the South's economy depended, and the gateway to the interior of Alabama. Its position at the northern point of Mobile Bay made it a strategic location; if it fell, the Union Army's advance would be unimpeded.  Before the Siege  The Mobile Campaign was a series of battles fought during the civil war in the Federal‚Äôs efforts to capture the city of Mobile, Alabama. From March 26th to April 9th, 1865, 6,000 outnumbered Confederate soldiers held off 45,000 Union soldiers that were attacking from Fort Blakeley and Spanish fort. The Union troops knew that the capture of Mobile would be one of the key points of ending the Civil War. Union Major General Gordon Granger ‚Äòs original plan was to attempt to capture Mobile right after the fall of Fort Morgan. To capture the city, Granger wanted to bring his troops up the bay, disembark on Dog River, and march into Mobile. Even though Mobile did have a lot of earthen protection, its number of men that were defending it was very scarce. According to Paul Brueske, author of The Last Siege, ‚ÄúHad the Federals known how few men defended Mobile, they could have then captured the city with minimal losses.‚Äù However, after the battle of Mobile Bay, Confederate General Maury, fearing an attack from the Federals, asked his superiors for reinforcements. Confederate General Lidell was sent to aid Maury. In late 1864, Union Major General Henry W. Halleck sent a letter to General Grant asking for the Armies of the Cumberland to be sent to General Canby to aid him in capturing Mobile. General Halleck planned to use Mobile as a base to attack Selma and Montgomery in later battles because Mobile was one of Alabama‚Äôs key sources for supplies such as ammunition and food. Canby was apprehensive in attacking Mobile due to the strong defenses the Confederates had established. The Federals could not attack from the north due to a marsh in that direction. Many large vessels could not get within 12-miles of Mobile because of these geographical features. General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard boasted that Mobile would hold a siege for at least two months. General Richard S. Taylor, son of Zachary Taylor, directed the small garrison that defended Mobile. In December of 1864, Granger initiated a raid on Mobile‚Äôs western defenses. However, on December 26th, Granger and his men had to turn back due to a shortage of supplies and they could not break through the strong defense that the Confederates had put up. This raid encouraged Alabama Governor Thomas H. Watt to issue a draft for more men to fight and to defend Mobile from Federal attacks. General Taylor directed General Gibson‚Äôs and Holtzclaw‚Äôs brigades along with General French‚Äôs Division to defend Mobile. Despite that, these brigades suffered many losses at the Battles of Franklin and Nashville. On January 28th, Lieutenant John T. Walker prepared to attack the Federal flagship Octorara docked in Mobile Bay with his vessel, the Saint Patrick. The torpedo that he was using to attack the ship malfunctioned and failed to explode, which caused the Federals to attack the Confederate vessel. After the attack, Federals stopped blockade running from Mobile Bay, but Confederates were still apprehensive that the Federals would attack the city of Mobile.  Campaign  Mobile was besieged by the Union Army from March 25 to April 12, 1865. The city capitulated on April 12.

He co-edited the journal from its inception in 1974 until his death. In 2007, the Society for Cinema and Media Studies awarded him its Outstanding Pedagogical Achievement Award. Early life and education Charles Nelson Kleinhans was born in a working- class neighborhood of Chicago. In the early 1950s, his family moved to suburban Park Ridge. He graduated from Maine Township High School in 1960, a classmate of Harrison Ford. He then enrolled in the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, from which he earned a Bachelor of Arts in comparative literature. Kleinhans was in NROTC in college and after graduating was obligated to spend two years in the Navy. Afterward, he resumed his study of comparative literature as a graduate student at Indiana University. There, in Bloomington, he met his future spouse, Julia Lesage, a fellow graduate student. Career After earning a PhD in comparative literature, Kleinhans found temporary teaching jobs at Chicago State University (fall 1974‚Äìfall 1975) and Northeastern Illinois University (winter 1976‚Äìwinter 1977). In spring 1977, Northwestern University's Radio/Television/Film Department hired him to teach courses on contemporary film theory and experimental film. In fall of that year, he started a tenure-track line at Northwestern as an assistant professor and taught \\"introductory courses in microcomputer graphics, photography, film and video making, media literacy, popular culture; [and] advanced courses in production in aesthetics, film/tv theory, mass culture theory, experimental film and video, Latin America media.\\" He also shepherded over 40 dissertations. He was subsequently tenured and promoted to associate professor. After 32 years at Northwestern, he retired (2009) and became an associate professor. Aside from his long tenure at Northwestern, Kleinhans is best known for his part in the founding and editing of Jump Cut, a media-studies journal. He, Julia Lesage, and John Hess conceived Jump Cut as their time at Indiana University was coming to an end. The first issue was released in 1974. The three edited it collectively until the deaths of Hess and Kleinhans. As stated in an editorial in the first issue, Jump Cut's principal goal was: Jump Cut was printed in tabloid form from 1974 to 2001, when it made the transition to an online publication as ejumpcut.org. Later life and death During his time teaching in Evanston, Kleinhans continued to live in Chicago. After retiring from Northwestern in 2009 as an associate professor, he moved to Eugene, Oregon where his spouse had long taught at the University of Oregon. He died of heart failure after a brief illness on December 14, 2017.

It is the largest plant-based consumer packaged goods company in the world, operating in 95 countries. Upfield was spun off from Unilever and purchased by investment firm KKR in 2018. History Margarine was one of the first products sold by the company that would become known as Unilever. Antoon Jurgens of Oss, Netherlands, acquired the patent for making margarine from its inventor Hippolyte M√®ge- Mouri√®s in 1871. Through a series of mergers Jurgens' company became Margarine Unie in 1927 and then Unilever in 1929. Since that time, Unilever has added other margarine and food spread brands. Although the food spreads division of Unilever maintained a robust profit margin, in the 21st century sales declined as many consumers switched to more natural foods, like butter. In the five years leading to 2014, sales of margarine fell 6% while sales of butter rose 7%. Following a February 2017 takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz, Unilever chief executive Paul Polman made a pledge to investors to boost returns. In April of the same year, Unilever put the margarine and spreads division up for sale with the intention of returning the net cash from the sale to shareholders. The sale sparked a bidding war among buyout firms including Apollo Global Management, CVC Capital Partners, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, and Bain Capital. According to Bloomberg, it was the biggest-leveraged buyout in Europe in 2017. In December 2017, Unilever accepted an offer of ‚Ç¨6.8bn from investment firm KKR. The purchase, which was completed in July 2018, was funded by European and North American private equity funds that are under KKR's control. The brands in the sale represented about 7% of Unilever's global business. Products and operations Upfield's notable brands include Flora, Stork, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, Rama, Country Crock, Becel, and Blue Band.

Thomson dedicated his life to the spread of the gospel and to medical missionary work. His work as part of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society(EMMS) transformed the organization from its focus on the slums of Scotland to an international missionary aid organization. During his time with EMMS, Dr. Thomson advocated for missionaries across the globe, including Dr. Kaloost Vartan of the Nazareth Hospital and Dr. William Jackson Elmslie in Kashmir. Dr. Thomson also served as a pioneer for medical missionary training by creating the original EMMS training school at the Cowgate dispensary. This led to more training schools being created in other parts of the world, like Bombay(now known as Mumbai) and Calcutta(now known as Kolkata), India.  Early life  Dr. Thomson was born in 1821 in Kirriemuir, Forfarshire in Scotland. His father was a merchant who died when Thomson was young, and his mother passed away soon after. As a result, Thomson was sent to live with his older brother, a headmaster at Golspie in Sutherlandshire. At the age of 17, Thomson and a friend decided to dedicate their lives to the church by joining the ministry and they began Sabbath- school teaching. His class grew from that of 3 students to a Sunday school of 200 students. At age 20, William's brother left him in charge of Golspie and during his time leading this school, he is said to have influenced a student to join the ministry. After his time at Golspie, Thomson served as an evangelist in the Lowlands. A reverend was once quoted saying that Thomson's sole goal in life was to convert people to Christianity.  Education  In 1847, Thomson traveled to Edinburgh where he planned to begin his collegiate studies. In order to support himself, Thomson worked as a private teacher but his first experiences were said to have been bad and he had little success finding a teaching job. Despite this, he continued his collegiate studies and worked as an assistant chaplain at the Calton jail for four years. At the end of his Arts course, Thomson was planning on going to theological college and to go abroad to China as a missionary. These plans changed after his encounter with an Irishwoman living in the lower districts of Edinburgh. When he approached the woman, she was hostile towards him until she realized that he might be a doctor. Thomson offered the Irishwoman basic medicine in the form of castor oil which improved her health. This made Thomson realize how medicine could be an asset in his work. This prompted him to change his plans of going abroad as a religious missionary and instead pursue medicine as his course of theology. After he completed his medical training, Thomson joined the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society (EMMS).  Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society  Thomson was first introduced to the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society in 1854 through an essay competition. Dr. Thomson submitted an essay that didn't end up winning but was highly praised by one of the judges, Rev. Dr. Guthrie. Dr. Guthrie and other members of the society pushed Thomson to publish his essay which he did. In this essay, Thomson detailed the role the Church should play in the lives of the poor at the time. Following this first encounter with EMMS, Dr. Thomson was asked to take a superintendent position at the 39 Cowgate dispensary. This dispensary was first established by Dr. Peter David Handyside and it was Dr. Handyside and a colleague that convinced Dr. Thomson to take over that dispensary. During his time as the superintendent of the dispensary, Dr. Thomson created a training institution out of the dispensary. The Medical Missionary Society at the time gave an annual grant so that their current medical students would have access to the dispensary. These students were unreliable which prompted Dr. Thomson to urge the Society for more money to fund a training school. After securing funds from a friend, Dr. Thomson set up the Medical Mission Dispensary and Training Institution. Through this, he and his successors, John Lowe and Sargood Fry, were able to train at least 200 medical missionaries for the Protestant Church. In 1870, after working at 39 Cowgate and with EMMS for 11 years, Dr. Thomson felt that he needed to step away from the society. In an article published after Dr. Thomson's death, the editor of Medical Missions at Home and Abroad, writes his theory on why Dr. Thomson resigned. According to the editor, a dispute between Thomson and the directors of EMMS over whether or not a student was qualified to be a medical missionary led to Dr. Thomson losing the respect of his students and his authority as their instructor. This then prompted his resignation and departure from the Society.  Life after EMMS  A year after leaving 39 Cowgate and the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society, Dr. Thomson wrote that throughout the months he was away from the dispensary he was able to connect more with god. In addition to reconnecting with his religious beliefs, Dr. Thomson began missionary work in The Canongate and set up a hospital there. After some time, and after much insistence from his loved ones, Dr. Thomson and his wife departed from Edinburgh and went to France. While he was there, Dr. Thomson and his wife were invited to a meeting for the Bible Society's Rooms, and Thomson's loved ones spoke about the admiration they had for him and gifted him and his wife with ‚Ç¨1000. After this, he remained in the Riviera for two years and was invited to stay in Mildmay where he lived out his last years of life by conducting evangelistic services and having morning worship with the deaconess. In September 1892, Dr. Thomson traveled to Bournemouth, where he ultimately died on April 29, 1893. Dr. Thomson and his relatives were buried in the cemetery at Bournemouth.  Advocacy and Aid  Throughout his life, Dr. Thomson was in constant communication with other missionaries across the globe. * Dr Kaloost Vartan: Dr. Vartan, founder of the EMMS Nazareth Hospital, was in need of funds to sustain his work and reached out to Dr. Thomson. With his help, Dr. Vartan was able to continue his work in Nazareth with money Thomson fundraised on his behalf. This money supported Dr. Vartan for two years until the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society (EMMS) was able to fund his stay in Nazareth. On October 21, 1865, a meeting of the Directors of the Society took place which led to the Society ‚Äúadopting‚Äù Vartan as an agent in Nazareth. * Dr. William Jackson Elmslie: In his memoir, a letter was included in which he thanked Dr. Thomson for helping the Kashmir Medical Mission be featured in the Medical Missionary Journal which brought attention to this mission. In the feature of the Kashmir (in the periodical referred to as Cashmere) Medical Mission, the authors of the Church Missionary Society periodicals shared excerpts from Dr. Elmslie's letters and communications with other missionaries. In these letters, Dr. Elmslie recounts his experiences in Kashmir and the struggles he and Rev. Handcock underwent as a result of the authority figures in Kashmir. These letters served as a direct form of communication between Dr. Elmslie and the members of the Society. * Dr. Andrew Davidson: In 1862, Dr. Davidson began medical missionary work in Madagascar that was carried on until the colonization of Madagascar by France. Dr. William Burns Thomson, with the help of Dr. Theodore Maxwell, was able to send Dr. Davidson teaching supplies that aided his work in Madagascar. These supplies allowed Dr. Davidson to teach chemistry to the twenty students he had in his Medical Mission College. Dr. Thomson also served as a spokesperson for Davidson at the London Missionary Society by asking for another missionary and nurse for Dr. Davidson. Ultimately, the London Missionary Society allowed Thomson and Davidson to make the ultimate decisions of the work that took place at the mission station in Madagascar which allowed them to teach natives chemistry and midwifery. Over time, Dr. Davidson gained the trust of the queen of Madagascar at the time and went on to build a hospital, dispensary, and the Malagasy Medical Mission College. Through this college, Dr. Davidson trained natives on what they needed to know to be a medical missionary so that they could take mission trips to other parts of the island such as Fianarantosoa. *Dr. Kenneth Macqueen: In 1863, Dr. Macqueen penned a letter, that was published in the Society's Report, in which he pleaded the Society to fund a similar dispensary to Cowgate's. The directors didn't want to fund Dr. Macqueen's dispensaries, but Dr. Thomson was able to find a donor who wanted to give to their cause. After receiving a letter from Dr. Thomson, the donor sent a letter to Dr. Macqueen offering 2000 pounds, ¬£1000 for the Bombay Institute and ¬£1000 for the Calcutta Institute in India. The terms for this donation were to raise donations amounting approximately 1000 euros, which they accomplished, thus funding the Bombay and Calcutta medical mission dispensaries.  Legacy  On multiple occasions, in his autobiography and in his address at the Mildmay Park Conference in London in 1869, he mentions how his work as a doctor served as an asset to his religious mission. He describes how he would preach to his patients while also treating them and how these patients would then return to continue hearing about Thomson's god. He describes how being a doctor allowed him to reach people from different places that he otherwise may not have reached and how his title as a doctor allowed him to be more well-received by the people he was trying to reach. Thomson's devotion to the causes of EMMS are said to have been admirable by his peers. According to a 1915 periodical, Dr. Thomson's effort to train more missionaries allowed EMMS to grow in Scotland and expand its missionary work with direct impact on the existing services of EMMS today.

Ian propositions Blake about being his sugar baby but she politely turns him down. Blake writes about the experience for the paper but while River is interested in the material he refuses to give Blake her column back until she points out that it sounds like he is trying to pimp her out in return for her column. Blake and Nikki attend a costume party where Blake shows up as Raoul Duke and is surprised to see Jacob dressed up as the same. Blake takes Jacob home, but their attempt to have sex ends when Jacob does not have a condom. Blake writes about their failed hookup for her column, to Jacob's horror. After weighing Ian's offer, Blake decides to go on a date with him with her primary motivation being her desire to compete with Jacob for the journalism award. On their first date Blake has sex with Ian. She initially believes that she received nothing in return, however Ian gifts her a scooter after stealing her bike. Blake begins writing about her experiences with Ian and her column becomes a hit. When Jacob questions the ethics of her decision to write about Ian, Blake points out her column is anonymous. Blake continues to date Ian and despite initially asking him for nothing eventually asks him to write her a recommendation letter for the journalism award which he agrees to do. One afternoon when Blake is high on MDMA after having accidentally ingested a laced cupcake prepared by Nikki, Ian turns up with a diamond bracelet asking her to attend a wedding with him. Blake accompanies Ian and realizes that the wedding is that of Morgan's sugar daddy. The groom accosts her after the wedding and tells her that he is interested in having sex with her.

Returning home Blake is confronted by Ian who has finally read the writing sample she sent him and discovered she is documenting their relationship. He threatens to ruin her career if she doesn't take the column down and withdraws his recommendation letter for the award. Reflecting on what to do Blake decides to sell the jewellery Ian gave her and refuses to take down the column. While both Blake and the men featured in her column were always anonymous she decides to publish her final column under her real name as she is not ashamed of her experiences. Heading to graduation Blake receives a message from Jacob urging her to meet him at the bleachers.

Direct applications  Example 1. Nesbitt's inequality. For positive real numbers a,b,c we have that frac{a}{b+c}+frac{b}{a+c}+frac{c}{a+b} geq frac{3}{2}. Example 2. International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 1995. For positive real numbers a,b,c , where abc=1 we have that frac{1}{a^3(b+c)}+frac{1}{b^3(b+c)}+frac{1}{c^3(a+b)} geq frac{3}{2}. Example 3. For positive real numbers a,b we have that 8(a^4+b^4) geq (a+b)^4. Example 4. For positive real numbers a,b,c we have that frac{1}{a+b}+frac{1}{b+c}+frac{1}{a+c} geq frac{9}{2(a+b+c)}.  Proofs  Example 1. We have that frac{a}{b+c}+frac{b}{a+c}+frac{c}{a+b} = frac{a^2}{a(b+c)}+frac{b^2}{b(a+c)}+frac{c^2}{c(a+b)} geq frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ac)} geq frac{3}{2}. Example 2. We have that frac{Big(frac{1}{a}Big)^2}{a(b+c)} + frac{Big(frac{1}{b}Big)^2}{b(a+c)} + frac{Big(frac{1}{c}Big)^2}{c(a+b)} geq frac{Big(frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b}+frac{1}{c}Big)^2}{2(ab+bc+ac)} = frac{ab+bc+ac}{2} geq frac{3 sqrt[3]{a^2 b^2 c^2}}{2} = frac{3}{2}. Example 3. We have that a^4+b^4 =frac{a^4}{1}+frac{b^4}{1} geq frac{(a^2+b^2)^2}{2} geq frac{Big( frac{(a+b)^2}{2} Big)^2}{2} = frac{(a+b)^4}{8}. Example 4. We have that frac{1}{a+b}+frac{1}{b+c}+frac{1}{a+c} geq frac{(1+1+1)^2}{2(a+b+c)} = frac{9}{2(a+b+c)}.

Life Harriet Bagwell was born Harriet Philippa Jocelyn Newton around 1853 in Dunleckney Manor, Bagenalstown, County Carlow. She was the eldest child of Phillip Jocelyn Newton (1818‚Äì1895) and his wife Emily (d. 1886). She married Richard Bagwell on 9 December 1873. The couple had one son, John Philip, and three daughters, Emily Georgiana, Margaret and Lilla Minnie. For the first part of their marriage the family lived in Innislonagh, moving to the family estate at Marlfield House, Clonmel, County Tipperary in 1884. After this move, Bagwell became active in local charitable concerns. Her mother-in-law, Frances Bagwell (n√©e Prittie), had founded a school for Swiss embroidery, and it is possible that this inspired Bagwell to found her own embroidery cottage industry at Marlfield in 1885. The aim of this was to enable women to work in their own homes to earn extra income. Bagwell provided these women with raw materials and designs, and organised their payment and sale of the produce. The designs were adapted from Egyptian and Indian artwork. The resulting Marlfield Embroideries was a success, and generated a great deal of income for the local community. Work from the Embroideries were exhibited at a number of shows, including the Royal Dublin Society's stand at the 1887 Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester, and the 1897 Lancaster Arts and Craft Exhibition. Bagwell's older half-sister from her father's first marriage, Mrs Anne Vesey, founded the Dunleckney Cottage Embroidery in 1889 and was modelled on Marlfield. Bagwell also established a society which provided penny meals to local people living in poverty, along with a registry office for servants. With her daughters, they created a cookery school for national school girls around 1900. In 1895 Bagwell founded the Clonmel Cottage Hospital, helped in the promotion of the District Nursing Association, and served as an executive committee member of the Women's National Health Association. After she was widowed in 1918, she left Marlfield in 1920, moving to Dangan, Carrickmines, County Dublin. During this time she complied an informal history of the Bagwells for the family. This history included accounts of the burning of Marlfield House in 1923 by republicans. She died at the home of her young daughter, Lilla Minnie, Birdhill, Clonmel, on 12 February 1937.

Yavlinsky has advocated undertaking a campaign to remove corruption in government. He has asserted that the judiciary of Russia should be made genuinely independent. =Economic policy= During the 1995 legislative and 1996 presidential elections, Yavlinsky promised economic relief for the middle class that was neglected during Yeltsin's economic reforms. At this time, Yavlinsky described the sort of individual that he believed might be drawn to Yabloko's platform by saying, Yavlinsky long had been a figure who supported democratic and free market reforms, but opposed the course of actions which Yeltsin's regime had taken to implement reforms. Yabloko's economic platform sought to focus on a different order of priorities than both Yeltsin's regime and other democratic opposition parties had. Yavlinsky had declared, In the 1990s Yavlinsky advocated the creation of a flat tax. He also advocated for a more transparent, responsible, and efficient budget policy.

Vault Protector coins () were a type of Chinese numismatic charm coins created by Chinese mints. These coins were significantly larger, heavier and thicker than regular cash coins and were well-made as they were designed to occupy a special place within the treasury of the mint. The treasury had a spirit hall for offerings to the gods of the Chinese pantheon, and Vault Protector coins would be hung with red silk and tassels for the Chinese God of Wealth. These coins were believed to have charm-like magical powers that would protect the vault while bringing wealth and fortune to the treasury.\\"Coins in China's History\\", published in 1936 by Arthur B. Coole (ÈÇ±ÊñáÊòé). Vault protector coins were produced for over a thousand years starting in the country of Southern Tang during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and were produced until the Qing dynasty. Vault protector coins were typically cast to commemorate the opening of new furnaces for casting cash coins.  History  = Early history = There is some speculation by the Chinese numismatist Guan Hanheng (ÈóúÊº¢‰∫®) that an enormous silver Ban Liang cash coin manufactured by the Kingdom of Qin in the year 336 BC had been cast to serve as some form of vault protector. In his book Ban Liang Huobi Tushou (ÂçäÂÖ©Ë≤®Âπ£ÂúñË™™), Guan argues that large silver Ban Liang was \\"cast in 336 BC to commemorate the firing of the furnaces that began production of the first Ban Liang cash coins of the Qin state\\" and that the large silver Ban Liang cash coin did not see any circulation as it was a commemorative issue. = Southern Tang = The earliest known vault protector coin known to exist is the Da-Tang Zhenku (Â§ßÂîêÈéÆÂ∫´) which translates as \\"the Vault Protector of the Tang Dynasty\\" and was cast during the Baoda period of Li Jing. The diameter of these Datang Zhenku vault protector coins is 6 cm, and they have a thickness of 0.6 cm, the diameter of the square center hole is 1.24 cm and the Datang Zhenku coin weighs 93.7 grams. Only one of these vault protector coins is known to exist and it was owned by a coin-collector from the city of Tianjin named Fang Yaoyu (ÊñπËó•Èõ®) during the beginning of the twentieth century and it was later owned by another private coin-collector called Chen Rentao (Èô≥‰ªÅÊø§) before it ended up in the collection of the National Museum of China during the 1950s.Google Books - The Zhangs from Nanxun: A One Hundred and Fifty Year Chronicle of a Chinese Family by Laurence Chang.

Shunzhi era  Following the Manchu takeover of Beijing in 1644, the Qing dynasty established new mints in the city. Almost immediately did the Qing start imitating Ming dynasty coinage, including vault protector coins. Two central government mints were opened in Beijing and they began to cast the Shunzhi Tongbao (È†ÜÊ≤ªÈÄöÂØ∂) cash coins closely modeled after the cash coins of the preceding Ming dynasty. A special Shunzhi Tongbao vault protector coin was cast that was 6 centimeters in diameter and contained the Manchu reverse inscription \\"Boo Yuwan\\" (). Another variant of this vault protector coin exists which has the Chinese character \\"Â∑•\\" on the right side next to its square centre hole on its reverse side.  Xianfeng era  The Leizhou City Museum (Èõ∑Â∑ûÂ∏ÇÂçöÁâ©È§®) in the city of Leizhou, Guangdong and the Palace Museum in Beijing both own a Qing dynasty era Xianfeng Tongbao (Âí∏Ë±êÈÄöÂØ∂) vault protector coin. The reverse inscription of this vault protector coin reads Da-Qing Zhenku (Â§ßÊ∏ÖÈéÆÂ∫´, which could be translated into English as \\"Vault Protector of the Qing dynasty\\"). These coins have a diameter of 14 centimeters. The square centre hole is 2.5 centimeters in diameter, the vault protector coin weighs 1.05 kilograms. Only 5 of these vault protector coins were ever produced and during the beginning of the Republic of China, a eunuch had stolen all of them, the aforementioned two cash coins remained in China while the eunuch sold the other 3 Xianfeng Tongbao vault protector coins for what was purported to be \\"a large amount of money\\" to a British man. A description of this vault protector coin also appears in the book \\"Zhongguo Guqian Daji\\" (‰∏≠ÂúãÂè§Èå¢Â§ßÈõÜ) written by Hua Guangpu (ËèØÂÖâÊôÆ), where it is valued as being worth 1.200.000 yuan. The Leizhou City Museum came in possession of this coin during the 1950s, prior to this it was privately owned. During the Xianfeng era another type of vault protector coins was cast by the Ministry of Public Works with the obverse inscription Baoyuan Juzao (ÂØ∂Ê∫êÂ±ÄÈÄ†, which could be translated as \\"made by the Ministry of Public Works\\"). The reverse inscription of this coin reads Zhenku (ÈéÆÂ∫´, \\"vault protector coin\\"). This vault protector coin is very large in its size and has a diameter of 11.52 centimeters, its square centre hole is 1.8 centimeters in diameter, and it has a weight of 837.3 grams. In 1936 Arthur B. Coole (ÈÇ±ÊñáÊòé) claimed that only four of five of these vault protector coins were ever produced by the Ministry of Public Works Mint in Beijing. A Xianfeng Yuanbao (Âí∏Ë±êÂÖÉÂØ∂) vault protector coin was cast at the Ministry of Public Works mint with a reverse inscription that reads \\"ÈéÆÂ∫´ \\" (Zhen Ku Boo Ciowan). This vault protector coin a diameter of 117.43 millimeters and a weight of 902.1 grams. Chinese numismatist Ma Dingxiang (È¶¨ÂÆöÁ••), in his book \\"The coins of Xianfeng\\" (Âí∏Ë±êÊ≥âÂåØ), claims that the style of this vault protector coin is consistent to the styles of other Xianfeng era cash coinages. Furthermore, Ma Dingxiang claims that there exists only a single other specimen of a \\"companion vault protector coin\\" that was produced simultaneously by the Ministry of Revenue Mint in Beijing. In 2009 a Baoyuan Juzao vault protector coin was sold at an auction in Tokyo, Japan. This same coin was sold at auction in the year 2013 for $408,279 (RMB 2,530,000). At the time of this auction, this sale had broken the record for the highest amount of money that was ever paid for a Qing dynasty era coin.  Qixiang / Tongzhi era  After the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, his son was crowned the Qixiang Emperor, however, after only one month his reign title was changed to the Tongzhi Emperor. Because if this only a very small number of cash coins using the Qixiang inscription was used, to commemorate the new emperor a Qixiang Zhongbao (Á•∫Á••ÈáçÂØ∂) vault protector coin were made, this coin does not have any characteristics that indicate which mint had produced it. The reverse of the Qixiang Zhongbao vault protector coin contains the inscription Da-Qing Zhenku (Â§ßÊ∏ÖÈéÆÂ∫´). This coin had a diameter of 10.1 centimeters and a thickness of 0.47 centimeters. A Qixiang Zhongbao vault protector coin was sold at an auction in Hong Kong in the year 2013 for $745,755 (HK$5,750,000).  Guangxu era  Under the Guangxu Emperor a bronze vault protector coin with the obverse inscription Guangxu Tongbao (ÂÖâÁ∑íÈÄöÂØ∂) and the reverse side contains the Manchu inscription \\"Boo Yuwan\\" (). This vault protector coin has a diameter of 6.2 centimeters and a thickness of 1 centimeter. A Guangxu Tongbao vault protector coin was sold at an auction in the year 2010 for $51,485 (RMB 319,200). = Taiping Heavenly Kingdom = A vault protector coin of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom on display at the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom History Museum in Nanjing. During the later part of the Taiping Rebellion, the government of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom casted a mall number of vault protector coins with the inscription Taiping Tianguo (Â§™Âπ≥Â§©ÂõØ), these cash coins were notably 7.6 centimeters in diameter and were also very thick. The reverse sides of these vault protector coins contained the characters Shengbao (ËÅñÂØ∂, \\"holy treasure\\").TaipingRebellion.com Â§™Âπ≥Â§©ÂõØ Tai Ping Tian Guo - Coins of the Taiping. Retrieved: 13 January 2020. In his book \\"Coins of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom\\" (Â§™Âπ≥Â§©ÂúãÈå¢Âπ£), Chinese numismatist Ma Dingxiang notes that the vault protector coins of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were manufactured for the mints of Hangzhou, Hunan, and Suzhou. There are only 5 or 6 of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom-made vault protector coins known to exist and these coins all tend to display some very slight differences between them. A specimen that was previously in the collection of Ma Dingxiang and sold at auction held in the year 2011 for an amount of $111,286 (RMB 690,000).  Modern reproductions  Due to the rarity of vault protector coins, there isn't a lack of reproductions and fakes appearing on the coin collecting market. In the modern era vault protector coins are sought after both as collectible items as well as financial investments. Furthermore, some commemorative modern coins made from precious metals are sometimes also based on pre-modern vault protector coins. In the year 1982 a gold coin based on a Xianfeng era vault protector coin was created, in 1990 another a gold coin version of a different Xianfeng era vault protector coins was created, and in 1998 a gold coin inspired by the Da-Tang Zhenku from the Southern Tang was produced.

It was designed by James Nangle and built from 1912 by the New South Wales Public Works Department. It was also known as The Farm Home for Boys, Girrakool and Kariong Juvenile Detention Centre. Today, the site is referred to as the Mount Penang Parklands, a redevelopment precinct containing parks and gardens, a high school, an events park, commercial and office space and residential development. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 September 2003.  History  =Indigenous and early colonial use= The area and surrounding Central Coast are the traditional lands of the Darkinjung language group of Aboriginal people. \\"Kariong\\" is said to be an Aboriginal word meaning \\"meeting place\\".(Government Architect's Office, Heritage Group, 12/2009) An Aboriginal sites study in 1994 for the City of Gosford area included the Mount Penang site. Evidence of pre-European sites found are associated with the Hawkesbury Sandstone formations, being rock engravings, grinding groove sites and shelters with both art and occupation deposit. Common motifs found at rock engraving sites include, what appear to be kangaroos and marine animals such as whales, fish and eels.Vinnicombe 1980 Human forms have also been recorded throughout the region.Lough 1980 Some rock platforms contain many motifs, while other sites may only a small number of engraved figures.Godden Mackay Logan, 2001 European colonisation of the Gosford district began in the 1820s, with the main points of entry being Brisbane Water in the east and Mangrove Creek (a tributary of the Hawkesbury River) in the west. Most of the development subsequently occurred in the eastern or coastal sector. Early settlement of the district can be divided into two phases: # the pioneering era, 1821‚Äì31, when the district's resources were exploited and little development took place; and # the developing era, 1832‚Äì43, when considerable growth occurred in population and industry. At the head of Brisbane Water, on land between Erina and Narara Creeks, a government township was laid out in the 1830s. It was described as the township at Port Frederick in honour of Frederick Hely, who was Superintendent of Convicts and had a large property on Narara Creek. But when the survey plan was sent to Governor Gipps for approval, it was returned with the notation \\"to be called Gosford\\". Early industry include timber getters (forest oak, ironbark and red cedar), lime burners (from shells from the many Aboriginal middens or large natural deposits around the shores) and ship builders of Brisbane Water (this activity continued into the 20th century). Early economic activity also included small farms and grazing properties. Citrus orchards were planted on farms from 1880 where timber getters had cleared the land, and climate and soils were suitable. As roads were developed, farming spread to Somersby Plateau. In 1897 the district produced 3% of NSW's citrus crop, increasing to 21% by 1921 and 34% by 1928. Market gardens and passionfruit were also increasing in popularity. Other early townships in the district were at East Gosford, Kincumber and Blackwall (near Woy Woy), where the main shipbuilding yard was located. Until the 1880s the district's timber and other produce went to Sydney by boat, since few land routes were available. The railway, which was completed in 1887, provided opportunities for commencement of tourist activities in the area. Large numbers of tourists used trains to travel to Woy Woy and Gosford for fishing, hunting and sight seeing trips. Guest houses were developed to accommodate this rising demand for overnight or holiday accommodation. Railway access encouraged other industries, including dairying in the districts around Wyong.Biosys, 2009, 12 =Juvenile Justice Centre= The Mount Penang Juvenile Justice Centre was the largest centre of its type in the Southern Hemisphere, accommodating 170 male juvenile offenders. The centre was set out on an open plan, with the detainees housed in dormitories and attending schooling and vocational technical training on site during the week. The principle of rehabilitation through the combination of education and physical labour is a doctrine that the centre had adopted throughout its history. Indeed, the initial building phase between 1912 and 1922 relied on the physical labour of the inmates for the construction of the centre's major buildings, many of which are still in use today. The site maintains a link with the earliest days of juvenile reform in NSW when male offenders were housed on retired navy ships in Sydney Harbour and on work farms in the Sydney district. Some of the earliest buildings were designed to resemble lighthouse cottages, in keeping with the nautical background of the school. The centre also provides a tangible marker of the reform system for boys spanning most of the twentieth century. The Nautical School Ships, 1866‚Äì1911 In 1866, the Industrial Schools Act was passed through the Parliament of New South Wales in an effort to control wayward or destitute children. The Act was initiated following the findings of an 1859 Select Committee on the condition of the working classes in Sydney. The committee estimated that there was up to 1,000 destitute children in Sydney alone, and recommended the establishment of reformatory schools to get them off the streets. The schools were designed on Industrial Schools in England which would remove children who were homeless, involved in crime or neglected in some way and place them in reformatories, separating them from the bad influences that they were under. Once \\"saved\\", the children could then be given a rudimentary education, taught the basics of a trade and be apprenticed out to start their lives as useful citizens. One response to the 1866 Act was the establishment of the Nautical School Ships, the first of which was the Vernon. Encouraged by Henry Parkes, the then Premier of New South Wales the ex-navy sailing ship was converted into a training ship to house up to 500 boys. The ships combined a system of education and military-style discipline, based on a reformist vision. Social philanthropists supported the principle of removing a child from a bad family environment in order to ensure the child's moral reform. Military-style drills were introduced under the guidance of the Superintendent (from 1878‚Äì1895), Frederick William Neitenstein. The days on board were divided in two, with lessons taking up one half of the day and drill taking up the other half. The boys were under constant supervision, with inspections being a means to ensure they stayed on the right path. The boys were further controlled through a class system of seven grades, with each grade carrying privileges and work routines. Boys worked on a marks system to advance to higher grades, receiving the extra privileges that went with them. By encouraging advancement, the system was designed to maintain discipline and ensure self-reliance, both seen as being essential to reform. The Sobraon, a second training ship that had been built in 1866, replaced the Vernon in 1890. Both ships were anchored off Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbour, the Sobraon remaining there until 1911 Whilst moored off Cockatoo Island, the boys of the Vernon and the Sobraon maintained a small farm to supply themselves with fresh food, a tradition that would be carried on at Mount Penang. The Establishment of Mount Penang, 1912 In 1905, the Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders Act was passed to replace the former Industrial and Reformatory Schools Acts of 1866. he Gosford Farm Home for Boys was built under this new Act. In the early 1900s, the Government Surveyor recommended the Mount Penang site as a possible location for a Government sanatorium; however, this was never acted upon. During the same period, the Government also looked for a site on which to construct a new centre for juvenile delinquents. The new centre would be based on similar principles as the Brush Farm in Eastwood, where hard physical work and a basic school education would combine to assist in the rehabilitation of delinquent boys. The centre would also take the boys from the nautical training ships, which had become outdated and expensive to operate by the early 1900s. On 1 July 1912, a party of approximately 100 boys aged between ten and sixteen began clearing a site at Mount Penang near Gosford, in order to build a new State-controlled farm for wayward boys. The farm was to replace the former Nautical School Ships and the small Brush Farm. All the boys in the working party were formerly of the Sobraon, and were supervised by the former probation officer of the Nautical School Ship, Herbert Charles Wood. The site was situated on the lip of a reasonably flat summit of a sharp escarpment, three miles west of the town of Gosford. The site was also isolated from main population centres, a requirement that had worked against the Brush Farm site at Eastwood which had been encroached upon by residential development. It was the combination of these factors of inaccessibility and isolation that led the committee appointed to locate a new site for the training of male juvenile delinquents to choose Mount Penang for their site. The chosen location of Mount Penang was one track to Sydney, which went via Mangrove Mountain and Wisemans Ferry. Although remoteness worked in favour of the choice of the Mount Penang site for the farm, it did create serious problems during the construction of the complex. The Construction Phase, 1912‚Äì22 Access to the proposed site at Mount Penang provided the first obstacle that needed to be overcome. The only access to the building site was via a steep track, with gradients of between 1:8 and 1:11. With all the equipment and stores being bought in by bullock, bricks were ruled out as the main building material, due to the difficulties of transportation and associated costs. From the inception of the project, a building committee was established to oversee the construction and to work through any potential difficulties. As an alternative to bricks, the Committee recommended the use of local hardwood and sandstone for the works, the latter quarried on site, The building committee architect, James Nangle, also recommended the use of concrete for the buildings, which would reduce cost and overcome the problem of transport. James Nangle had worked as an architect in Sydney since 1891, being employed in the design of residential, commercial and industrial projects. His work with the Department of Public Instruction on the design of portable classrooms made him well qualified to sit on the Building Committee for Mount Penang. Nangle's association with the Department was further strengthened through his teaching in the technical education branch from 1890 to the late 1930s. From 1913, he was the Superintendent of the Branch, being instrumental in its move towards a more vocationally orientated approach. The Minister for Public Instruction approved the plans, with a budget set at ¬£12,000 for the main structures. Work commenced on the first day of July 1912, with the boys providing the labour; another cost-cutting measure. To begin with, the boys were accommodated in military-style bell tents while they worked on the construction of their own dormitories. The boys were split into work parties under the supervision of tradesmen who could provide assistance and guidance to the boys. The first buildings to be constructed were the ones that were the most essential to the institution: dormitories, a dining room, staff quarters, offices, a kitchen, store rooms for supplies and equipment, and accommodation for the tradesmen and Clerk of Works. The Minister for Public Instruction laid the foundation stone of No. 1 Dormitory by December 1912. By September 1913, No. 1 Dormitory had been completed, as had the Assistant Superintendent's residence and four weatherboard cottages for the married staff members. These cottages still stand along the entrance road to the complex. The first schoolmaster at Mount Penang, George Walpole, kept a diary of his time there, which included the construction phase in 1912. Walpole noted that the concrete mix for the works was made up of three portions of crushed stone, two portions sand and one portion cement mixture, all of which was mixed by the boys before being tipped into prepared boxing or formwork to create the walls. As two groups mixed the concrete, another would convey it to the site, while a fourth team lifted the boxing from the day before up the scaffolding for the next day's operation. In their spare time, mainly on Sundays when no construction work was undertaken, the boys developed a sports ground under Walpole's supervision, which was dedicated in 1912. The ground was developed adjacent to the building site, at the front of the dormitories but at a lower level. To the north of the building site, a team of boys also opened up a mile-long drain using a road plough, and sank a well 3.65 m (12 ft) deep to tap an underground stream for fresh water. By 1914, Mount Penang was dealing with all boy delinquents who had been institutionalised in NSW through the Children's Courts. In the Superintendent of Gosford Farm Home's Report to the Minister for Public year 1915, he set out the principle of the Farms' work ethic thus: > \\"Habits of steady industry are acquired, which are carried outside the > boundaries of the institution and characterise the future conduct of many > lads who, before, were inclined to settle down to any form of work and > herein lies the secret of reformation in many cases. Boys frequently are > bad, or delinquent, not from natural bent, but simply because they are lazy > and have never been forced to work steadily at any occupation requiring the > expenditure of a certain amount of energy.\\" In the same year, the Superintendent reported that a second dormitory of concrete, a concrete reservoir, a store and office had all been completed. The two dormitories were built either side of the Household block, with the officers' dwelling behind. This arrangement allowed for a suitable system in which to classify the inmates as well as providing constant supervision. Other works on the site during this period included: the construction of a windmill to pump water from a fresh water stream below the escarpment; five galvanised tanks for water storage; a carpentry workshop, a trolley line for transporting the sandstone from the quarry to the site; and a bullock team and wagon, two horses, two spring carts and one dray. The buildings were all roofed with corrugated iron. Also during this period a permanent dam and concrete reservoir was completed, supplying the site with constant fresh water. Construction work continued at the site until 1922. The northern, curved part of The Avenue, along which several of Mt. Penang Boys Home's main buildings are located, is thought to have been laid out 1912 as part of the initial detention centre development. The southern, straight part of The Avenue is thought to have been laid out slightly later, when attention turned to site landscaping. A row of brush box trees (Lophostemon confertus) was planted on each side. It appears that the road had been constructed and the trees planted by 1938. It functioned as one of two main entry ways into the site off what is now the Central Coast Highway. The Avenue is now the site's main entry drive.Biosys, 2009, 1 The Superintendent at Mount Penang during its formative years was Frederick Stayner. Stayner began teaching in 1884, and had been appointed to the Sobraon by the Department of Public Instruction in March 1894. From the Sobraon he had been transferred to the Carpentarian Reformatory at Brush Farm, Eastwood, before moving with the boys to Mount Penang in 1912. His experience and training from the two former institutions was instrumental in the development of Mount Penang. Under Stayner's leadership, a number of significant administrative operations were implemented at the farm. The first major change was the introduction of an honour system, where extra privileges were awarded to the boys if they behaved within the guidelines set by the centre. As an incentive the boys could shorten their time at the centre by advancing to probation based on the centre's honour system. Stayner organised the disciplinary system along a military line and teachers to carry or use canes without the direct authority of the Superintendent. The emphasis of the centre was to be on the character development of the boys as opposed to an unnecessarily harsh regime. Competitive sports were also introduced, giving the inmates a sense of teamwork as well as providing them with a regular exercise program. Schooling was also provided to the inmates. On arrival at the centre, boys were assessed to determine what level of education they had achieved. Each boy was required to reach a fourth class standard of primary school, regardless of age. Initially, the school operated in any building, or verandas, available to them. In the first years, schooling was conducted in the converted end of the new dormitory until a school building was erected behind the main complex. The syllabus was based on the 1905 Primary Syllabus, which was supplemented after 1935 with visits from lecturers from the University of Sydney. Consolidation, 1923‚Äì40 In 1923, the State Government passed the Child Welfare Act, repealing and consolidating a variety of provisions that existed in legislation relating to the care and management of children under State protection. The Act was designed to place a much greater emphasis on children's health, welfare and rehabilitation under the direction of the newly created Child Welfare Department, with Walter Bethal, who had been instrumental in setting up Mount Penang, as secretary. The new Act dealt with juvenile offenders who had come through the Children's Courts up to the age of sixteen, or those between sixteen and eighteen on minor charges in the adult system. The distinction reflected the Government's recognition of the need for more lenient treatment of young people under State care, away from the harsh environment of the NSW criminal justice system. Under the new system, the Gosford Farm Home was classified as an Industrial School with the schooling component being controlled by the Department of Education. Between 1923 and 1940, the living conditions and amenities at the centre gradually improved. An ongoing building program ensured that the boys continued to get building experience that could be used on their release, while at the same time upgrading their present conditions. In 1936, electric lighting and a hot water system were installed, which was followed in 1937 by a refrigeration service. By the end of 1937, the centre comprised four dormitories, a recreation hall that catered for concerts and movies, a dining and kitchen block, a hospital, a bathing and sanitary block, as well as a variety of outbuildings including a dairy and accommodation for single and married staff. Due to the relatively poor quality of the soil at Mount Penang, a farm was established on Government land at Narara, about 16 km from the centre. Here, thirty-one boys were transferred to clear the land and prepare it for cultivation. A vegetable garden at Narara provided for the requirements of both the Narara and Gosford centres. However, the Narara farm was closed in April 1934 following the opening of a much larger institution at Berry in the same year. All the while, pasture improvement was being undertaken at Gosford, with sufficient milk being produced for the centre's purpose. However, as farm training was now offered elsewhere, more emphasis was made on vocational training at Gosford from this time. As part of this program, further interaction with the local community in Gosford was encouraged. The institution wanted to make the local community more aware of the Farm Home, thereby gaining a level of acceptance. This was to be achieved through a number of initiatives. For example, sporting teams were organised at the centre to play in the local competitions, including football, cricket and athletics, which helped promote a positive self-image in the boys and improved relations with the local community. Further involvement came through the public use of the Recreation Hall to view the latest movies on the centre's own screen. The boys were also employed on community projects in and around Gosford. Maintenance, gardening and small construction jobs could be carried out by the boys, which helped develop a sense of civic pride and responsibility amongst the inmates. Despite these initiatives, some problems were inevitable considering the nature of the institution. As early as 1923, an inquiry was conducted by the Children's Court into allegations of mistreatment of the boys at Mount Penang. Part of the findings of the 1923 report was that there had been undue severity in some punishments at Mount Penang and it recommended a lessening of the use of the cane by officers working there. A second inquiry in 1934 investigated the punishment regime more closely, and found that it was common practice for more senior boys to administer punishment on junior inmates. Until 1934, this type of punishment often went unsupervised by staff and was open to serious abuse. One example of these forms of punishment had the offender being required to fight up to five other boys, with or without gloves. The fight continued until it was deemed that offender had received sufficient punishment. In 1925 the newly formed Main Roads Board began construction of the Pacific Highway. This work, completed in 1930, made road travel to the Gosford area much easier than previously. Further improvements, such as replacement of the Hawkesbury River car ferries with a new road bridge in 1945, led to a rapid increase in the numbers of day trippers to the Central Coast. Mount Penang Training School for Boys, 1944‚Äì1960 In May 1944, a new sub-institution was opened at Mount Penang by the then Minister for Education and Child Welfare, Clive Evatt. Built at an initial cost of ¬£25,000, it was originally designed as a maximum- security sub-institution for unresponsive boys, but after 1948 it became a privilege cottage, representing a shift in governmental policy in child welfare. The changes in government policies generally sought to move away from the authoritarian structures and harsh discipline that was associated with reform schools, towards a more open, family-style environment. It was an earlier example of the same kind of thinking that had led to the establishment of the Gosford Farm Home for Boys, establishing a smaller scale, more personalised type of institution. Also in 1944, a new Superintendent, Vincent Heffernan, was appointed. Heffernan had been an executive officer of the National Emergency Service during the war years and bought with him a new sense of purpose for the centre. Heffernan noticed that by the mid-1940s the centre was in a dilapidated state, both physically and ideologically. The honour system that had been introduced under Stayner had deteriorated, and discipline had become more and more rigid. In addition to this, the pastures were in poor condition as were both the pigs and cattle. Of further concern was the state of the various workshops and the schoolhouse. Between 1944 and 1947, Heffernan set about reinvigorating the Institution; buying new equipment for the trade rooms, establishing a boot shop to supply shoes, upgrading the pastures, and raising the pigs and cows to stud standard. A new dairy and stock shed were also constructed as part of the upgrade. The construction of new recreational facilities, including new playing fields, bowling greens and a tennis court, as well as extensive landscaping and planting were also begun during this period. From the 1940s, Mount Penang began to show their livestock, winning a number of prizes at local events and the Royal Easter Show in Sydney. In May 1948, the new Minister for Education, Bob Heffron, opened the converted detention cottage as a privilege cottage (renamed McCabe Cottage in 1976), in line with the new government thinking. The building was redecorated internally, and boys were allowed their own room. Although still supervised, the atmosphere was more relaxed than in the main centre. Adjacent to the cottage, two residences were also built to house visiting families, further reinforcing the reformation ideal. McCabe Cottage represented a new level of privilege at the centre. From the opening of Mount Penang, boys had had an opportunity to improve their position at the centre by showing that they could be trusted. The remote location of McCabe Cottage from the main centre at Mount Penang reinforced the trust that the boys had gained from the Institution. A survey of the former inmates of McCabe Cottage, conducted in the 1950s, found that of sixty-two boys who had passed through it, seven had been returned to the main institution, thirty-eight had been discharged and fourteen were still in residence. Only one of the discharged boys had been re- admitted and one had absconded. It seemed that the Cottage was working in the rehabilitation of the boys and helping them make a successful adjustment to life in the community. In 1976, McCabe cottage became a Pre-discharge Unit for the Justice Centre. In 1946, the name of the Institution was changed from The Farm Home for Boys, Gosford, to Mount Penang Training School for Boys, Gosford. The reason behind the name change was that the new name more clearly represented the idea that a varied program of planned training was required for the re-education and rehabilitation of delinquent youth. The application of the name \\"Mount Penang\\" was favoured over some of the other established names for the area, such as Kariong, as it had not been applied to any other institution or building. Since the 1940s the greatest development in Gosford has been the growth of urbanisation in the eastern sector, brought about by road and rail improvements, an upsurge in secondary industries and State planning policies which see Gosford as part of an expanding Sydney region. In recent times, the expansion of metropolitan Sydney, the availability of private and public transport and improved road systems have combined to change the development of Gosford from a rural community prior to World War II, to that of a city containing some secondary and service industries related to the tourist trade. Agriculture and horticulture continue in the mountain areas but, in declining importance to employment and production.Biosys, 2009, 13 1960 ‚Äì 2000 During the 1960s, five new buildings were erected behind the administration building and a new sports ground was built. The new buildings housed an assembly hall, a gymnasium, a new kitchen/dining room, a laundry and boiler house and a storeroom. The sports ground was defined on its northern boundary by this new collection of buildings. After 1970 gaps with deaths or removed trees have not been filled in the avenue. Several trees have been removed in the avenue's south, with road widening, creation of the link road to Old Mount Penang Road to the east, driveways for the fire station etc. In 1975, the new Superintendent of Mount Penang, Laurie Maher, implemented a building program aimed at improving the centre itself as well as the morale of the boys and staff. The first project in 1975 was internal modifications to the dormitories, with new and upgraded bathroom and toilet facilities being installed, providing more privacy for the boys. During the same year, a storeroom within the administration block was converted into a holding room. As well as renovations, a number of new buildings were constructed on the site during the late 1970s and early 1980s: a new Officer's Dining Room was built in 1976 adjacent to the boys' dining rooms; and a new office block, which included offices for the Superintendent, Deputy Superintendents, Salary Officer, a police interview room, a conference room and general office, was erected in 1978. A new hospital block and nurses quarters (to replace the original 1920s hospital) was also built during this phase, as was a new store and amenities building to the north of the gymnasium. In 1978, a 50m swimming pool was added to the recreational facilities at Mount Penang, constructed on the site of a disused bowling green. The former clubhouse associated with the bowling green then converted to a teacher's staffroom. In 1980, the school program was returned to the Education Department after having been controlled by the Child Welfare Department since 1953. A number of new programs were introduced into the school at this time, including a new program for boys who rebelled against the traditional methods and a remedial program for one-on-one teaching. In 1991, the school program was updated to a secondary level, having operated at a primary level since its beginning. Further to these changes, the school's name was changed to \\"Girrakool\\". It had been found previously that former inmates were reluctant to use certificates which had Mount Penang inscribed on them due to the attached stigma. The new name eliminated this concern. The school itself was now a collection of demountable schoolrooms, with the two original buildings serving as a library and cultural centre. A large proportion of the detainees at Mount Penang, often the majority, were men and boys of Aboriginal identity. This is not always clear in the documentary evidence of the history of the place, but it remains a vivid recollection of former detainees and their families. The centre was also often used as a place for immediately housing Aboriginal children removed from their families before they were assigned and relocated to other institutions. Because of this Mount Penang has close associations with the Kinchega Boys Home. The distinctively Aboriginal history of the Centre reflects the changing methods used to try and control the state's Aboriginal population, the very limited socio-economic roles allowed to Aboriginal people within the broader community, and the changing philosophies of \\"managing\\" a dispossessed people during the course of the 20th century. In 1990, the centre's Vocational Training Unit was relocated to a former Roads & Traffic Authority (RTA) depot on the western extreme of the site. In 1991, the last major building program was completed with the opening of the Frank Baxter Kariong Juvenile Justice Centre in 1999. This Juvenile Justice Centre was a purpose-built high security centre for those detainees with a history of escape or who had proved to be difficult to control in other centres, as well as those who had committed more serious offences on one edge of the former site. In 2009, arson led to the loss of the former Paint Shop in the western precinct. It was reported at this time that other buildings in the western precinct were in a neglected state. In 2015, the remaining correctional facility, then known as the Kariong Juvenile Correctional Centre, closed. =Redevelopment post-2000= Mount Penang Gardens (2003) Mount Penang Gardens in 2003, becoming a tourist attraction on the Central Coast. Designed by Anton James of JMD (James, Mather Delaney) landscape architects.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 1 October 2015 The gardens comprise 12 themed gardens feature a variety of permanent and changeable garden areas modelled around a cascading water fountain, bottle trees (Brachychiton rupestris) from Queensland, an obelisk water feature and an outdoor amphitheatre. The amphitheatre is an event space. Around it are the Bottle Tree Garden, Puddle Garden, Rock Garden and Display Garden, which are available for hire for events. Themed gardens include the Pond Garden; Entry Garden; Heath Mounds; Misty Mountains; Bamboo/Grass Gardens; Colour Field Garden; Bottle Tree Garden; Display Garden; Gondwana Garden; Rock Garden; Drylands/Arid Garden; Dragon Garden; Little Oasis; Grass/Sedge Garden; Cascade Garden and Puddle Garden. Fissure gardens feature specialised plants: Pandanus or screw pines; rainforest; lithophytes (rock-dwellers) and epiphytes (tree- dwellers); Barefoot/fissure and Wind fissure. Water Gardens including the Lower Pond and the water cascades feeding it. Landmarks include an Obelisk, Queensland bottle trees and Wondabyne sculptures (see below). Sculpture installations in Mt. Penang Gardens (2004) Wondabyne Quarry was the source of a fine-gained Hawkesbury sandstone used to create some 20 sculptures in the Wondabyne 1 and Wondabyne 2 international sculpture symposia conducted on the banks of the Hawkesbury River in 1986. 12 of these sculptures since 2004 have stood in the sculpture garden on the banks of Mt Penang Parklands' upper lake while the others are towards the Baxter and Kariong Detention Centres on the Parklands' northeast boundary. The sculptures were positioned as per the plan of artist, Bruce Copping, above the upper lake in the Botanic Gardens. The International Sculpture Symposium movement was spearheaded by Karl Prantl in Austria in 1959. The first international sculpture symposium took place in an abandoned stone quarry in St. Margarethan, Austria. Sculptors from around the world joined together to produce a permanent public artwork from local stone, a dynamic which would provide the model for many symposia to follow. Since then international sculpture symposia have been held in numerous towns and cities around the world, including Lindabrunn, Austria and Hagi, Japan (a town known for its pottery). The first Sculpture Symposium in Australia was held at Wondabyne near Gosford in New South Wales in 1986. Wondabyne is well known for its history of stone quarrying. The Wondabyne rail stop was named after Mt Wondabyne, located adjacent to the station across the bay, known as Mullet River or Mullet Creek. It was originally built in 1889 for quarry use only and known as Mullet Creek Station. It was later renamed Hawkesbury Cabin station, then finally Wondabyne. The stone for the Wondabyne Sculptures was sourced from the Wondabyne Quarry which is now owned by Gosford Quarries. The Wondabyne Sculpture Symposium held in 1986, featured sandstone sculptures by Bruce Copping and 11 other sculptors from 6 nations. The symposia was undertaken along the foreshore area near the railway stop at Wondabyne. However, in 1994 Gosford Council decided that it was in the best interest of public to relocate these sculptures due to access and liability issues at the original site. It was then decided the more desirable and accessible site was the new Mt Penang Parklands. The cache is hidden in the bushland area of the park and is a stone's throw from the Wondabyne Stone Sculptures.Ken Phelan, pers.comm., 16 December 2009 National Aboriginal and Islander Dance Association HQ and commercial development (2007) In February 2007, NAISDA, the National Indigenous Dance College, opened their new premises at Mt. Penang Festival Parklands site.Managing New South Wales Government Heritage, Issue 6, 9/2007 That year approval was given to build a Parklands Post Office, Family Tavern, Brewery & Hunter Wines Promotion Centre on The Avenue. Kariong High School (2008) In 2008 approval was given for construction of a new Kariong High School and landscaping in the parkland's south, facing the Pacific Highway. With approval for the high school on the former Events Park site, the Festival Development Corporation needed to re-establish the events function elsewhere on the site. In 2009 approval was given for two event park stages proposed (1) for the 2009 Flora Festival in September; (2) for a permanent events park layout further north and inside the Parklands site, away from the highway. Mount Penang Event Park Central Coast Region Development Corporation (CCRDC) owns the Mount Penang Parklands and is charged with securing ongoing management of public open spaces and community facilities at Mt. Penang, protecting and enhancing the broad Mt. Penang Parkland precinct including its remnant bushland and habitat areas. CCRDC gained a $45,000 grant from the NSW Government, through the Destination NSW 2011/12 \\"Regional Tourism Product Development Program\\" to electrify the Mount Penang Event Park. The total infrastructure project cost $61,000 and will enable new business opportunities, support and enhance regional tourism. Installation of permanent electrical services was effected between March and September 2013. The Corporation expects to attract a variety of new major events, and provide enhanced services to existing event organisers. Capable of accommodating up to 25,000 people, the Mount Penang Event Park is a prime location for events on the Central Coast.  Description  Mount Penang Parklands is located west of the sandstone plateau of Penang Mountain. The area and surrounding Central Coast are the traditional lands of the Darkinjung language group of Aboriginal people. \\"Kariong\\" is said to be an Aboriginal word meaning \\"meeting place\\". Archaeological excavations on Mt.Penang have revealed evidence of cultural Aboriginal sites associated with Hawkesbury sandstone plateaux, such as rock engravings, grinding groove sites and shelters. Common motifs found at rock engraving sites include kangaroos, whales, fish and eels. The Kariong area features temperate rainforest. Trees in the Mt. Penang Parklands vicinity support hollow-dependent native fauna species including nocturnal mammals such as possums and gliders, microbats and some bird species such as parrots, cockatoos and wood ducks. Mature native trees would have been logged in the area in the 19th century. For most of the 20th century, the site of the Mt. Penang Parklands was part of a much larger area that accommodated an institution for the care, control and rehabilitation of delinquent and destitute boys.Government Architect's Office, Heritage Group, 12/2009 It is now being redeveloped by the NSW Government. The Parklands are made up of six key areas: Event Park, Retail/Commercial Park, Mt Penang Gardens, Sports Park, Future Business Park and Bushland. The landscape characteristics of the site derive from its bushland setting, originally separated from suburban development; its location on a broad, ridgetop plateau with gentle slopes suitable for farming; availability of water supply through its central drainage swale and underground stream; the curving configuration of the eastern side of the ridge, with its steep rock benches downslope, creating a broad, amphitheatre effect; the excellent views outwards from the site from northeast, through east, to southwest; the diverse but pleasant views across and within the site created by the curving roadway, the spines of old buildings, the man-made dam and the grazing paddocks; the pastoral, almost Arcadian, rural landscape with old buildings and mature trees; direct access to an almost intact Hawkesbury sandstone plant community, with a good range of shrubs and herbaceous plants as understorey; he boundary or perimeter plantings of mature pines, poplars, coral trees and brush box; the remnant stands or scattered specimens of ancient scribly gums; the unexpected, but pleasant, informal \\"courtyards\\" created by the progressive placement of buildings over time; and the spaciousness around the buildings created by the numerous playing fields. The original buildings and most of the buildings that followed have been designed by the Government Architect, operating through the Department of Public Works and Services. A member of the original building committee was the prominent architect, James Nangle, who also proved influential during the design and construction of the buildings. The first buildings were designed so that the inmates could build them under the supervision of skilled artisans and tradesmen. The steep escarpment made the transport of building materials very expensive and James Nangle chose site- mixed concrete, using cement, sand and crushed sandstone as w economy measure (the sand may have been made from finely crushed sandstone). The concrete does not appear to have been reinforced and was poured in shallow timber forms, lifted in stages. Other materials used were timber and corrugated iron, with the majority of the early staff cottages null of weatherboard. The first dormitories and administrative buildings were constructed in the colonial era, with wide verandas, steeply pitched roofs and regular punctuation of windows and door openings. Plan forms were simple rectangles. The houses were bungalows with a similar character. The later houses are of mass concrete and show a superimposed Federation influence. These were introduced between the Colonial houses so that the styles alternated. Later buildings used brick as the principal building material, but continued to utilise the same simple shapes and motifs and, even though built over several decades, were very consistent within themselves and blended with the earlier structures. The 1980s buildings, which are located between re residences and the dormitories, utilised the same elements as the original Colonial buildings and serve as an important visual and physical link between the dormitories running along the ridge and the \\"Carinya\\" dormitory and the maintenance building further to the west. Whilst many of the education buildings, which are standard Department of Education demountable classrooms, depart from the themes outlined above, they are generally placed in discrete groups which are screened from the main buildings by vegetation. All buildings are single-storeyed, giving the site a low and spread out appearance. Ornamentation is almost totally lacking on all the buildings, which therefore rely on form and play of light and shade for total effect. Further unity is provided by the grouping of buildings by function, which is both an operational characteristic and a response to the topography. The McCabe Cottage complex is an architectural departure from the other buildings on the site. It is seated on the opposite side of the site and both the main building and the two detached cottages are excellent examples of 1940s Functionalist architecture. The contrast of this highly contrived architectural style with the main complex is dramatic but is moderated by its remote location, such that it stands as a separate entity. The farm buildings are also departures from the mainstream buildings. Of these, the barn is an excellent example of organic vernacular architecture, utilising the same characteristic mass concrete material as the main buildings. The others are utilitarian structures that follow modular construction patterns. The siting of the buildings in their farm paddock setting gives them considerable importance in the landscape. Dating of items is difficult, firstly because of the lack of accurately dated site plans showing the built elements at any given point in time and, secondly, because of the lack of adherence to recognised architectural styles of the various periods (with the exception of the McCabe Cottage complex). It appears that construction on the site was not an ongoing continuous process but, rather, several buildings were constructed at a time and were separated from previous and following periods of construction by many years. This pattern could be explained by availability of funding.Mount Penang CMP 2001. Goddan Mackay Logan Mount Penang remains intact enough to demonstrate the evolution of juvenile justice systems in 20th century NSW.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Mount Penang Juvenile Justice Centre has been the most important juvenile detention centre in NSW for most of the twentieth century and is a direct continuation of the nineteenth-century system of reformatory training ships. The design of the early buildings, their configuration and the layout of the site itself, as well as its agricultural and pastoral features, its remnant dairy and its landscaping collectively and individually illustrate juvenile penal philosophies and practices of the period and their subsequent evolution over eighty-five years of operation. The location of the centre is a feature in the historical expansion of the city of Sydney into its rural hinterland and its operations are an element in the development of Gosford and the Central Coast. Mount Penang also has significance for the local Aboriginal people both pre and post-contact, and during the time when Mt Penang as used as a juvenile detention centre and accommodated a number of Aboriginal detainees for whom the site would have profound associations. The centre has notable aesthetic qualities associated with its site and the available views, and layout of the low-scale buildings and the landscaping. The earlier buildings are attractive, human-scaled structures, which, while of an institutional character, utilise colonial homestead architecture appropriate to their setting and construction techniques of particular interest. The earlier buildings reproduce these forms to reinforce the characteristic appearance of the complex, whilst the McCabe Cottages group is an excellent example of the Inter-War Functionalist architectural style. The siting and relationship of buildings to each other and to the sports fields, paddocks and vistas are all components of the operational requirements and practices of the centre. These provide technical information regarding juvenile detention and reformatory practices. Mount Penang is very important to the many boys and young men who were detained there over the course of nearly a century. For most detainees, Mt Penang is a place where the unforgettable occurred ‚Äì experiences that strongly influenced the course of their lives. The place is significant to the many men and women who lived and worked at the former detention centre. For many of these people, it is a place of substantial personal and professional achievement. Mt Penang is also important to the local community as a landmark of historical and aesthetic importance. The place has functioned as a community meeting point, with many links between the wider community and the detainees and staff. Mount Penang Juvenile Justice Centre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 September 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Mt Penang has an associational link to the nineteenth-century system of training ships Vernon and Sobraon ‚Äì of which it was the immediate successor. These links are preserved in the growing of fresh produce, which the training ships had utilised on cockatoo Island and was continued at Mt Penang, The colonial character of the early dormitory buildings and their later naming after various ships from that period also contribute. Various changes in the juvenile penal philosophies and practices over the course of the twentieth century, are reflected in the development of the site and its features. The buildings and their arrangements are representative of the designs for government institutions, such as asylums and orphanages, fashionable at the time. The particular character of the place has evolved as a result of the ongoing and changing requirements of the centre and reflects the use of the labour and skills available within the centre. The rural location, its agricultural and pastoral features, its remnant dairy and the landscaping undertaken at the Centre demonstrate the work and recreational activities undertaken by the juveniles at the Centre over eighty-five years of operation. The location of the institution reflects the expansion of the city of Sydney into its rural hinterland following the improvements in transportation of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The location of the institution reflects the increasing urbanisation of the city area leading to space pressures upon institutions of this type. The complex has local significance in the development of the Gosford and Central Coast region as a place of employment and as a land use over more than eighty years of operation. Mount Penang is very significant in the Aboriginal history of NSW during the 20th century, being a major place of incarceration and detention of Aboriginal boys and men from all over the state, and a place for temporarily housing removed Aboriginal children before their relocation to other institutions such as Kinchega Boys Home. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The design and construction of the early dormitories was supervised by the prominent architect James Nangle, OBE, an early supporter of the use of concrete and steel in building. He was the secretary and testing architect of the Institute of Architects and was a member of the Mount Penang Building Committee. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The complex has positive aesthetic qualities associated with its site, the available views, the layout of the low-scale buildings and the landscaping undertaken for the centre. The early surviving buildings are attractive, human-scaled structures which, while of an institutional character, utilise a number of features derived from colonial homestead architecture appropriate to their setting. The colonial character of the interiors of the early dormitory reflects the desire to impart a particular aesthetic character to the facility. The architectural character of the buildings reflects a range of administrative objectives, such as the desire to minimise the prison character of the facility and to create the character of a rural colonial homestead in keeping with the reformatory aspirations of the institution. The siting and topography have been utilised in the design and evolving development of the centre to create a particular character appropriate to its operation. The sense of open space created by views out from within the centre, the enclosure provided by the uncleared surrounding bushland and the unfolding of vistas along the curving entrance road into the centre are essential elements of the institutional character of the centre. The McCabe Cottage complex is an excellent example of the Inter-War Functionalist architectural style. Its physical isolation from the main complex allows this building and the architectural character of the main complex to coexist without visual inconsistencies. Later buildings, particularly the most recent, reproduce the predominant architectural character of the older buildings to create a uniform appearance across the complex. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Mt Penang is of profound significance to the people who were detained there over its long history. For these people, Mt Penang is a place that reflects formative life experiences ‚Äì both positive and painful. It is a place where the detention of thousands of boys and young men can be acknowledged. The place is of very strong significance to the many people who worked there over many decades. For these people, Mt Penang is a place of personal and professional growth and achievement, as well as experiences that have strongly influenced their lives and outlooks. The site is a significant and recognised physical, social; and historical landmark for the communities of Gosford, Kariong and Somersby. In a wide variety of ways, it has functioned as a community meeting place and a resource that has supported local community needs. Mt Penang is a symbol of the experiences of many individuals detained over the course of nearly a century and of the staff who worked with them. It is a place where the many stories about these experiences are validated and told, and a place that many former detainees and staff want to visit. It is a symbol of the substantial historical and social influence of the detention centre on the development of local communities. Mt Penang is a place where many progressive innovations were introduced into the operation of juvenile detention services. It is, therefore, a place of personal pride and achievement for members. Mt Penang is a place where many staff lived, raised their families, socialised, and for long friendships and tight-knit communities. It is a place where some interaction between detainees, the families of staff and the wider community was possible. Mt Penang is significant to local Aboriginal people both pre and post-contact, and during the time that Mt Penang as used as a juvenile detention centre, when it accommodated a number of Aboriginal detainees for whom the site would have also profound associations. The site is valued as a landmark and community meeting place for its social, community service and aesthetic qualities. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The complex is a component in the overall system and practice of justice in NSW and has comparative relationships with female juvenile and both mate and female adult detention centres. The design of the buildings and their layout and relationship to each other is representative of the operational requirements of low-security juvenile detention and the comparison of this to other penal institutions provides technical information in this respect. The siting and relationship of buildings to each other and to the sports fields, paddocks and vistas are all components of the operational requirements and practices of the centre. These relationships demonstrate these requirements. The grouping of buildings which house similar or related functions into discrete areas is representative of the typical design of large institutions and, at Mount Penang, demonstrates the presence of the centralised design and planning associated with this government facility. Whilst centrally designed initially, Mount Penang was mostly self-sufficient in the supply of building skills and labour. Following its establishment, the centre has typically provided the new facilities and alterations to existing facilities that have been required based upon its own day -today needs. In this regard, the layout and operation of the Centre today reflects the modifications to the centralised plan that are the result of continued evolution and experience in the operation of a juvenile detention and reformatory facility. The body of experience reflected in today's facility provides information that is not obtainable from other sources. The archaeological resource at Mt Penang has some technical resource significance through its potential to provide information relating to the development and operations of the school not available from other sources. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There are few, if any, comparable surviving juvenile detention centres of this period in Australia and Mount Penang has rarity value in this respect. It has been the most important juvenile detention centre for NSW for most of the twentieth century and has no close comparison in this respect. Mount Penang was the largest centre of its type in the Southern Hemisphere, accommodating 170 male juvenile offenders. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The design of the early buildings, their configuration and the layout of the site itself illustrate range of juvenile penal philosophies and practices of the period, including the wholesomeness of the agrarian lifestyle, social isolation as a means of moderating negative influences, the influence of sporting activities and the use of communal dormitories for positive social reinforcement.

He was a medical missionary for the Baptist Missionary Society that served in the Belgian Congo, more specifically Yakusu. He was responsible for the establishment of a hospital, community- based dispensaries and training centres of medical auxiliaries. Chesterman's network of health dispensaries employed preventive medicine using the new drug tryparsamide to combat the prevalent issue of sleeping sickness in the area. His implementation of mass chemotherapy was extremely successful in eliminating the disease. Such success led to his methods being widely adopted in Africa, making Chesterman a prominent contributor to the field of tropical medicine. In 1974 he was knighted (Knight Bachelor) by Queen Elizabeth.  Personal life  = Early Life and family = Chesterman was born on 30 May 1894 in Bath, Somerset, England. His parents were William Thomas Chesterman and Anne Greaves Chesterman. He was born into a large Bath family that had a history of strong Christian connections going back to Neuchatel, Switzerland, and to the west country. The members of Chesterman's family were members of Manvers Street Baptist Church in Bath, which was the church where Chesterman was baptised as a young man on 31 January 1909. On 7 July 1917 Chesterman was married to Winifred Lucy Spear at Manvers Street Baptist Church. From their marriage, they had five children and they were Henry David Chesterman, Frederick Clement Chesterman, Hilda Heather Chesterman, Michael Paul Chesterman, and Elizabeth Hazel Chesterman. = Education = Chesterman was well-educated throughout his life. He was educated at Victoria College from 1905 to 1907 and then at Monkton Combe School from 1907 to 1911. Chesterman then went to study medicine at the University of Bristol from 1911 to 1917. His interest in tropical medicine stemmed from his experiences as a medical student dresser in Serbia during the World War I, where he treated victims with a variety of tropical scourges. His desire to pursue a career in tropical medicine especially stemmed from his responsibility for a malaria diagnostic service under his apprenticeship to Major Philip Bahr in Palestine. During his apprenticeship, he witnessed a lot of typhus and dysentery. He enrolled for a tropical medicine course at the London Dock Hospital after demobilisation. Afterwards, he pursued and received the Cambridge Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, as well as the London MD in tropical medicine. = Military Service and honours = In 1915, Chesterman served with the first British field ambulance in Serbia, while also serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria from 1917 to 1918. Additionally, he received the Serbian Red Cross medal and was given the position of the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1919 in recognition of his efforts with malarial patients among the troops in Damascus.  Mission  = Calling = Two people Chesterman looked up to were David Livingstone and Albert Schweitzer. After reading On the edge of the Primaeval Forest, Chesterman wrote an appreciation letter to Albert Schweitzer from his mission station at Yakusu, which was 2,000 miles east of Lambar√©n√©, in the former Belgian Congo and this letter was acknowledged by Schweitzer. Chesterman similarly admired the work of David Livingstone and this could be seen through his rejection of a promising academic career to follow the footsteps of Livingstone. As he travelled by ship to and from Serbia in 1915, he caught his first glimpse of Africa, which sparked his fascination. In 1955, as chairman of the Albert Schweitzer Fund in Great Britain, he hosted Albert Schweitzer's visit to Great Britain including a visit to Buckingham Palace. = Service = In August 1920, Chesterman journeyed to the Belgian Congo as a medical missionary of the Baptist Missionary Society immediately after he completed his studies in tropical medicine at the Albert Dock Hospital. On his arrival, he was given the position of the head of a new medical mission at Yakusu. Through the help of Arnold, Chesterman's brother who was a qualified architect, a new hospital was successfully constructed. Medical missionary service grew in the region through the 1960s. Within the riverside villages nearby Yakusu, a third of the population was suffering from an infection known as sleeping sickness. Through his treatment centres, Chesterman began a weekly programme of injection using the supply of a new drug called tryparsamide. He worked in collaboration with the Belgian authorities and such a partnership allowed for the development of a network of village dispensaries staffed by Congolese auxiliaries. Their methodical use of this new drug was so effective that it nearly eliminated sleeping sickness from the Yakusu region within seven years. Such an outcome raised Chesterman's status and he became perceived as a \\"powerful medicine man\\" by the locals. Soon after, Chesterman made use of both chemotherapy and nursing auxiliaries to fight the epidemic of yaws in the same region. Rather than relying on the improvement of standards of living and public hygiene, Chesterman advocated for the mass use of chemotherapy, which complements his support for the motto \\"prevention is better than cure\\". He also believed that the development of a programme of simple health posts that functioned through the service of trained and supervised medical auxiliaries would support the adoption of Western medicine in tropical Africa. This model would be further developed by Stanley George Browne in Nigeria leading to Chesterman's design being implemented to manage infectious diseases across the continent.  Life after missions  In 1936, Chesterman departed from Yakusu and left his missionary work behind. He was called by the Baptist Missionary Society to go to London to take up the position of the office of medical secretary and medical officer. During his time at the base in London, he participated in policy formulation in both missionary and colonial medicine. On his return, Chesterman involved himself in a variety of efforts that led to his legacy. In 1938, Chesterman attended the World Council of Churches meeting in Madras, where he persuaded Ida Scudder to allow the admittance of men students to the Vellore Women's Medical College. Chesterman joined a general practice in Buckinghamshire owing to the emergence of World War II. However, after the war, he became a renowned consultant in the subject of tropical medicine and was in great demand by the Colonial Office, insurance companies and foreign governments. It is reported that he was called to treat Mahatma Ghandhi because of his expertise in tropical medicine. Chesterman was offered the position of a lecturer in tropical medicine by the Middlesex Hospital. He contributed greatly as an active member of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and became appointed as the vice-president of the Society from 1951 to 1953. He became the president of the Hunterian Society from 1966 to 1967. Owing to the lack of books for the purposes of training the auxiliaries through his strategy, Chesterman wrote his own textbook titled African Dispensary Handbook (1929), which was revised and re-issued under the tile Tropical Dispensary Handbook for wider use. His new book was published in seven English editions and was also translated into French, Portuguese and Spanish. Additionally, he published a variety of articles on tropical medicine, as well as In the Service of Suffering, a popular history of medical missions. In addition to these contributions, he took on more responsibilities and positions: the president of the Medical Missionary Association, vice- president of the Leprosy Mission, supporter of the Friends of Vellore, the chairman of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital Fund, and a member of the colonial advisory medical committee. During World War II, Chesterman moved his family to Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire. With the passing of the war, he moved to and lived in Hampstead. There, he and his wife became members of Heath Street Baptist Church. He was an honorary Fellow in the Royal Academy of Music. He received the Order of the British Empire in 1917. In 1974 he was knighted (Knight Bachelor) by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of his overseas medical service. On 20 July 1983 Chesterman died at Bushey Health, Hertfordshire. He was cremated at Hendon, London, on 27 July.

Prior to her NOAA career, she operated under the United States Department of the Interior‚Ä≤s Fish and Wildlife Service from 1949 to 1956 and under the United States Fish and Wildlife Service‚Ä≤s Bureau of Commercial Fisheries from 1956 to 1970 as Murre II. The ship originally operated as a self-propelled barge, first as BSP-1915 for the United States Army during World War II and then for the Fish and Wildlife Service before undergoing conversion into a research ship in 1963.  Construction The Maritime Shipyards of the United States Army Corps of Engineers built the vessel at Seattle, Washington.AFSC Historical Corner: Murre II, Supply & Research Power Barge Retrieved August 26, 2018 She was launched in 1943.  Service history  =U.S. Army= Upon completion, the vessel entered United States Army service as the self-propelled barge BSP-1915 during World War II. She operated in the Aleutian Islands, hauling passengers, mail, fuel, and freight. =Fish and Wildlife Service= Murre II operating as a self-propelled barge, loaded with lumber and a bulldozerStarboard quarter view of Murre II On 14 May 1949, the U.S. Army transferred BSP-1915 to the United States Department of the Interior‚Ä≤s Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) at Kodiak, Alaska. The FWS renamed the barge Murre II and assigned her Juneau, Alaska, as her home port. The FWS continued to operate her as a self-propelled barge, using her to haul cargo and personnel to stream watchmen at stream guard camps and to the FWS field station at Little Port Walter in Port Walter, Alaska. She also served as a floating base for FWS surveillance aircraft and their crews. In 1956, the Fish and Wildlife Service underwent a major reorganization in which it was renamed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and its ocean-going ships like Murre II were consolidated under USFWS's new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF). Later that year, on 11 November 1956, Murre II suffered minor damage due to a blow-back in her engine room furnace which caused an explosion and fire. As late as 1963, only cursory oceanographic studies of the waters of Southeast Alaska existed. Murre IIs shallow draft made her ideal for operating in the region's shallow waters, and in that year the USFWS installed research equipment aboard her to address shortfalls in understanding of the oceanography of Southeast Alaska. In her first assignment in her new role as a multipurpose oceanographic research vessel, Murre II conducted a preliminary survey of Auke Bay. As she continued her work, an estimated 80 percent of Southeast Alaska's first recorded identifications of marine zooplankton came from samples taken by scientists aboard Murre II. In May 1964 a crankshaft broke in one of Murre IIs main engines, forcing her to cut short her monthly oceanography cruise ‚Äì in which plans had called for her to conduct both an oceanographic survey of Traitor's Cove and midwater trawling operations ‚Äì and return to port. Repairs took several months, during which the USFWS research vessel Heron took over her duties, but Murre II eventually returned to her oceanographic operations. =NOAA= On 3 October 1970, a major reorganization occurred which formed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the United States Department of Commerce. As part of the reorganization, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries was removed from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and placed under NOAA,Guinan, John A., and Ralph E.

Via a phased process during 1972 and 1973, however, the major ships of the National Ocean Survey and National Marine Fisheries Service, as well as those of the Environmental Research Laboratories, integrated to form a consolidated and unified NOAA fleet, operated and maintained by the National Ocean Survey‚Ä≤s Office of Fleet Operations.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner - Timeline of Significant Events Retrieved August 23, 2018 With the creation of NOAA, Murre II initially became NOAAS Murre II (FRV 63) and later was redesignated NOAAS Murre II (R 663), but rather than transfer to the consolidated NOAA fleet during 1972 or 1973 she continued to be operated and maintained directly by the NMFS‚Ä≤s Auke Bay Laboratory until 1987. After the creation of NOAA, Murre II continued her oceanographic activities. In 1972, she supported the NMFS's Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment, and Prediction (MARMAP) program. In August 1975 she made the first cruise to acquire information on the abundance and distribution of humpback whales in Southeast Alaska. In 1977, she supported a study of the effects of logging on the Porcupine Creek area. In 1977 and 1978, she took part in a long-term study of undisturbed estuarine systems by supporting investigations of the benthic populations of Steamer Bay, and she conducted trawl surveys of the distribution of Alaska pollock, also known as walleye pollock, in nursery areas in Stephens Pass and Tenakee Inlet in 1978 and 1981. In 1981, she also returned to Porcupine Creek to continue her support of the study of the effects of logging on the area. As part of \\"Plankton Watch 1982\\" ‚Äì a cooperative program of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Juneau-area nonprofit private fish hatcheries, and Auke Bay Laboratory ‚Äì she monitored plankton in Auke Bay weekly during 1982. She also conducted many surveys of pink salmon and chum salmon and carried out oceanographic and plankton sampling in many parts of Southeast Alaska during the 1970s and 1980s. During the 1980s, she served as the base of operations for research activities such as the autumn collection of Pacific ocean perch in Southeast Alaska, and in the mid-1980s she took part in United States‚ÄìCanada transboundary Pacific salmon studies in the Boca de Quadra area of Southeast Alaska. In 1987, NOAA finally transferred the operation and maintenance of Murre II to the NOAA fleet. She was decommissioned in 1989 and sold in 1991. According to NOAA, many Auke Bay Laboratory scientists described Murre II as \\"the ideal vessel for Southeast Alaska coastal operations ‚Äì supporting research efforts and moving people and supplies when and where needed,\\" and she had completed \\"35 years of distinguished service supporting fisheries research in Southeast Alaska waters\\" at the time of her decommissioning. She also proved seaworthy, surviving various encounters with severe weather; on one occasion, while returning from a research project, she encountered a storm in the Gulf of Alaska that ripped some of the wood sheathing off her hull, but the nails securing the wood to the hull remained in place and only a few of her above- water cargo bulkheads suffered damage. =Later career= After NOAA sold her, Murre II eventually became the property of a community college in Poulsbo, Washington, which used her on Puget Sound as a training vessel for scallop draggers.

It is often characterised by being inspired by nature, Scandinavian mythology, and Celtic knot patterns. Jewellery has a history in Scotland dating back to at least the Iron Age.  Traditional examples  Penannular brooch from the St Ninian's Isle Treasure Traditional examples of Scottish jewellery are often functional objects that have been decorated and over time have become jewellery items. Over time, these necessary objects took on more and more decorative appearances, and are now considered an aesthetic item that is more of an accessory. = Kilt pin = The kilt pin is a functional object that weighs down the edge of the apron of a kilt to keep it in place during movement. = Penannular/ Celtic brooch = The ring and pin style penannular brooch, also known as the Celtic or Viking brooch, had the original purpose of being a fastener for clothing. Also native to Ireland, its design was meant to mirror that of the torc. The first examples of this style of brooch date from circa 700CE. These items were first produced for the elite class out of precious metals, and over time the more simple item of the thistle brooch emerged from this tradition. = Thistle brooch = The thistle brooch is a simpler version of the penannular brooch, with less surface decoration, which gained popularity around 1100. The thistle is the national flower of Scotland and acts as an emblem. Today, thistle brooches are often made of silver and contain a thistle motif, and are not necessarily a penannular brooch. Examples of different styles of Scottish Luckenbooth brooches with varying decoration styles = Luckenbooth brooch = The Luckenbooth brooch is a style of brooch that originated on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. It is a kind of annular brooch that is heart shaped. It often comes in the form of two hearts woven together, with more ornate brooches also containing a crown pattern. The name Luckenbooth comes from the locked booths along the royal mile that had a similar pattern. This style first gained popularity in the 17th century, and had a revival in the 19th century in the form of pebble jewellery. They were traditionally given as a token of love or as an engagement present. A set of 16th Century Scottish Pebble Jewels, made of agate, gold and enamel = Pebble jewellery = Pebble jewellery, featuring the stones agate or \\"Scotch Pebbles\\", Cairngorm, jasper, jaspagate, and sometimes bloodstone, freshwater pearls, gold, silver and granite, is a style of jewellery that has a long history associated with Scotland. Pebble jewellery refers to a style rather than a specific item, with many examples of pebble brooches and bracelets, though other items such as pendants have also been known to be decorated in this style.  Materials  The materials traditionally used to create jewellery in Scotland are also found in the local area such as the agate mined from volcanic rocks north of Dundee. = Metals = The most common forms of metal in Scottish jewellery are silver, enamel, gold and pewter. These are often the backing to a stone setting in the case of rings and brooches, but can also provide decoration through casting and other decorative methods. Gold can be found locally in Scotland around the areas of Lowther Hills, Wanlockhead, and Leadhills. The first documentation of gold in the area is from the 16th century, and this gold was made into the Scottish Crown and supported a community of goldsmiths around the country who are still active today. There was even a short-lived gold rush in the 1860s. Silver was also actively mined in Scotland, with over five individual sites that, over time, have had silver extracted from them. = Stones = Stones such as agate, cairngorm citrine, jasper, malachite and granite were mined in the hills of Scotland and were popular in jewellery. Agate was made popular in Scottish jewellery styles in the 19th century, popularised by Queen Victoria. These stones are often found on bracelets, pendants and brooches. Sapphires, although rare in Scotland, can be mined from the Isle of Harris. Pearls are often common in jewellery in Scotland, with the addition of them to the Scottish Crown in the 16th century. They come from a pearl-bearing mussel, half the population of which are native to Scotland.  Techniques  Throughout history, metalworkers did not only produce jewellery, but also worked to produce handles and decorative cookware. Cold metalworking techniques can be used to make penannular brooches, beginning with wire and then flattening the ends to create the brooch shape.  History  A pendant with a Celtic pattern from Iona The crafting of jewellery or fictional items that could have been embellished to create a form of jewellery has a history in Scotland dating back to at least 300BCE, with the emergence of the \\"Celtic\\" style of decoration. The Celtic style and the Pictish style are very similar and both have an influence in Scottish jewellery today. Pictish has been discovered through archaeological investigation since the 18th century, and is commonly made of silver. A sizeable example of a discovery of Pictish jewellery was found at the Gaulcross hoard in Aberdeenshire, with examples of fragments of silver bracelets, brooches, and pendants from the post-Roman period. These finds contain examples of chain work, and ornate decoration on the fragments. They are now on display at the National Museum in Edinburgh. Other Pictish hoards have often found torcs, and different kinds of penannular brooches, some zoomorphic, though bronze brooches are more common than silver. In the Middle Ages, ornate jewellery was a sign of a high class. Lower-class people tended to wear more simple items that were primarily functional and made of more simple materials such as copper or pewter, compared to richer materials such as silver or gold. During the 1800s, a boom in the production of Scottish-style jewellery resulted due to the building of railways in Britain and increased access to travel. Scotland became a holiday destination, and jewellery was in demand as a souvenir. As a result, the styles of Scottish jewellery started to be produced in England, specifically Birmingham and Exeter. A resurgence of Celtic and medieval style Scottish jewellery occurred in the 19th century, as did the popularisation of agate pieces, also known as \\"pebble jewellery\\". During this period there was a rise in creation and wear of agate brooches and bracelets due to Queen Victoria's interest in the stone. The interest in agate re-emerged again in the 1970s. The Victoria and Albert Museum has many examples of Scottish jewellery from the later half of the 19th century, both pebble styles and Celtic designs. The modernist period of jewellery making began in Britain in the 1950s, inspired by the sleek, simple style of Scandinavian designs from earlier in the 20th century. According to the National Museum of Scotland, \\"British Modernist jewellery became defined by the use of textural, sculptural gold work, inspired by nature and often incorporating large gemstones\\".  Modern  Today, Scotland offers a wide range of styles of jewellery, ranging from the traditional Celtic style, to vintage Victorian and Edwardian pieces, to contemporary art deco and art nouveau styles. The tradition of jewellery making in Scotland continues today with many courses offered in Colleges around Scotland in various levels of difficulty in jewellery making.  Crown Jewels  The Scottish Crown in 2011 Despite the Honours of Scotland often being referred to as the \\"crown jewels\\", there are no pieces of pure jewellery in the usual sense in the set. It consists of the crown, the sceptre, and the Sword of State. The crown is the only object of the three that is supposed to have been made in Scotland. It was originally dated from approximately 1503, but was remodelled due to damage in 1540 by the Edinburgh goldsmith John Mosman. Over six weeks, Mosman added 68 Scottish freshwater pearls, 41 ounces of gold, and 44 gemstones to the new crown, but also made use of the gold and jewels from the original state crown.  Other Noteworthy Pieces  This section contains information on other famous pieces of jewellery that either originate from or are associated with Scotland. = Stewart Jewels = The Stewart Jewels are items of jewellery that originate from the Stewart dynasty who ruled Scotland for generations and went on to rule England after the death of Elizabeth I. The set consists of three items, all of which are on display with the Honours at Edinburgh Castle: the St. Andrew Jewel, a collar of the Order of the Garter, and a ring with a ruby set into it. = Lorne Jewels = The Lorne Jewels, part of the Secondary Honours of Scotland, were gifted to the nation in the 1930s by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyle. The jewels consist of a single necklace with a pendant and a locket that was made in London in the 1870s and was a gift from the 9th Duke of Argyll to his soon-to-be wife. It consists of a chain made of diamonds studded with pearls, the pendant has a pearl set in the centre which is surrounded by two rows of diamonds of different shapes. The locket hangs from the bottom of the pendant and is attached by 2 emeralds shaped into the likeness of bog myrtle. The locket itself is shaped like a pear and is encrusted with diamonds, with extra decoration in sapphires depicting the motto of the House of Lorne and the Galley of Lorne. This piece is also on display at Edinburgh Castle.  Noteworthy jewellers  =Matthew Auchlek= Matthew and John Auchlek worked for James IV and Margaret Tudor. They were recorded making chains and necklaces. They gilded the sceptre, the king's spurs and the buckles of the queen's bridle and horse harness. Matthew Auchlek gilded a reliquary of Saint Duthac.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1500-1504, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 376 380, 385, 390. = John Mossman = The two Mossman men, John and James, were both goldsmiths who worked in Edinburgh in the 16th century. Both served as court jewellers to the Stewart family during their Scottish rule. They are also known for owning the John Knox House in Edinburgh. The identities of the two men are often confused, with many sources being unclear on who is the father and who is the son. John Mossman was an Edinburgh-based goldsmith who is most famous for remodelling the Scottish crown in 1540. He made a reliquary for a bone of St Adrian of May for James V from Scottish gold.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 396. = James Mossman = James Mossman was the son of John Mossman. He and James Cockie were made free men of the Edinburgh incorporation of goldsmiths on 1 May 1557.Jean Munro & Henry Steuart Fotheringham, Edinburgh Goldsmiths' Minutes (SRS: Edinburgh, 2006), p. 23. He was the court jeweller for Mary of Guise, and reportedly produced pieces for both her and the royal family. Mossman was executed for his loyalty to Mary, Queen of Scots during the siege of Edinburgh Castle in 1573. He pledged Mary's jewels for loans and set up a mint for silver coins in the castle. He was hanged on 3 August 1573. = Thomas Foulis = Thomas Foulis was a goldsmith who made silver plate for James VI and others. He became an important financier of the crown.Julian Goodare, (2004, September 23).

The mural, a 16' x 26' foot long canvas located on the United Nations Security Council's east wall, features a central image of a rising phoenix surrounded by images of war and disharmony, near the mural's bottom, and more tranquil images at the top. The mural accompanied renovations to the Security Council by Norwegian architect Arnstein Arneberg, and was first publicly displayed on April 4, 1952. It was commissioned by the Norwegian government as a gift from Norway to the United Nations. In 2013, Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide, stated that Krohg's ambition \\"was to give the United Nations a chamber that could inspire those working in it to carry out the core of the United Nations mandate\\". Krohg's mural has been met with controversy. Some, such as the Los Angeles Times, called it \\"imaginative\\", while the BBC described it as \\"the world's worst mural, at which I have sat and gazed for many bewildering hours\\". TOC  Artist background  Per Krohg, also known as Per Lasson Krohg, was born June 18, 1889 in Oslo Norway and died March 3, 1965 in Oslo aged 75. As the son of painter Christian Krohg, Per Krohg studied under his father at the Academie Colarossie art school in Paris between 1903 and 1907. Between 1907 and 1909 Krohg was a pupil of French painter Henri Matisse. He then returned to Norway and was appointed a professor at the Oslo State Art and Craft School. As identified by Encyclopedia Britannia, \\"Krohg‚Äôs early paintings were primarily landscapes and portraits, but his large, expressive, flowing strokes were better suited to the monumental character of mural paintings\\".  Selection and design process  The United Nations entrusted Norway to fit out and decorate the Security Council while Sweden and Denmark were responsible for the General Assembly Building and Secretariat Building. These three Scandinavian countries were given the role of expressing the \\"important political, diplomatic and symbolic position assigned to these countries during the first phase of the United Nations Organisation\\". According to Glambeck, the work of Per Krohg and other Norwegian artists was selected by Jacques Carlu and Howard Robertson from the United Nations Art Panel to be presented to the United Nations Security General. Once selected to complete the mural, the local authorities in Oslo created an art studio for Krohg to use in the creation of the mural which was located in Oslo's Town Hall. In 1940 Krohg designed the artwork and presented sketches to the United Nations.  Artistic inspiration  Krohg's mural design was inspired by traditional Italian Renaissance frescoes. He reinterpreted renaissance frescoes with modern forms of painting by applying oil paints to a large piece of dry canvas. Krogh's strong Christian faith was also a key inspiration to his mural, as his modern interpretation of Italian Renaissance Frescoes resemble the religious murals found in Catholic churches. When painting the mural Krohg was also inspired by his teacher Henri Matisee. Matisse inspired Krohg to utilise a mix of fauvist colours, exaggerated gestures and depictions of everyday life. Krohg was also part of a group of four Norwegian artists including Henrik Sorensen, Jean Heiberg and Axel Revold who emphasised the purpose of their art as a form of moral education. This is evident in the United Nations Security Council mural through Krohg's aim to create an artwork which inspires peace and harmony.  Subject  The mural as seen from the Security Council observation seats Krohg's artwork consists of eight main elements, one large bottom field and seven separate framed panels. These panels combine together to display a pictorial story which can be read as a horizontal and vertical story. = Bottom field = In the bottom field Krohg used brown and red tones to depict a coiled dragon holding a sword in its mouth as it attempts to pull it out of its body. Above the dragon Krohg has painted a bridge and a sloping hill in which humans are climbing towards a brighter field above. These men, women and children are moving from each side of the sloping hill to meet in the middle where a white Phoenix stands with its wings unfolded. Krohg wanted to display an image of the future world in which the United Nations would save the world, just as according to his Christian belief, Jesus Christ saved the world. This is demonstrated through his use of a framework of Christian iconology where he has replaced Christ with a rising phoenix. According to the United Nations the bottom field of the mural \\"represents man's efforts to emerge from a dark past of war and slavery to a better life and a future illumined by science and the arts\\". On the right side of the bottom field, Krohg has created an image of three shackled men which are embraced by the human figures in the panel above. On the left side a female figure is climbing up a rope also moving towards a brighter panel above. Both images on the right and left side depict \\"multiple scenes of human struggle with life and death\\". = Square panels = In the two square panels the forefront displays a crowd of joyful people from different ethnicities and a background filled with urban architecture. A line of blue silk runs between the two square panels and the vibrant colours creates a \\"striking contrast between the dark figure climbing into the urban area with their backs to us and the colourfully dressed crowd facing us\\". The line of blue silk running between the two square panels illustrates the United Nation's commitment to future peace and individual freedom. In the right square panel, a man stands waving the United Nations flag among the joyful crowd, emphasising the role of the United Nations in creating a peaceful world after World War Two. = Central oval panel = The oval piece sits in the centre of the artwork above the Phoenix and displays an image of calmness and serenity as a man, woman, and child sit kneeling. This panel reflects the Security Council's main purpose - \\"to maintain the world in a state of peace\\". The woman is kneeling with a bouquet of flowers in her hand and holds the elbow of the man next to her. Above the couple a tree is pictured where a figure is depicted handing an orange fruit to the child below, symbolising charity. As stated by Trygve Neergaard, Krohg was inspired by his heritage and his painting Peace in the Norwegian National Museum. In this artwork, \\"the children surrounded the solemnly kneeling parents in safe tranquility\\", inspiring Krohg to place a similar concept in the centre of the United Nations Security Council. On the right side of the tree a young boy stands observing the familial bliss shared between the kneeling figures. = Extreme left panel = The extreme left panel also depicts a city environment. The highlight of the panel is a human figure depicted as opening a window, allowing sunshine to enter in the room. A man is also pictured, pulling a woman from the dark world below. At the top of this panel six figures engage in a business trade and exchange different tools and bags of wheat. This illustrates movement from World War Two towards harmony and sharing. = Extreme right panel = In this panel Krohg illustrates an image of a man standing next to a prancing horse, admired by a figure with a pickaxe in dark hues from below. Above the horse sits a woman looking into a microscope and man looking into a telescope, illustrating the world's increasing knowledge and value of health and science. = Top left field = The entire top field is dominated by green trees that resemble palms and cypress trees. On the left two figures are depicted building a form of architecture which has been suggested to resemble Oslo City Hall and represents industrial expansion. In the top left corner a figure stands next to a blank canvas and begins to paint the Sun in front of him. = Top right field = The right top panel is also dominated by images of vegetation similarly found in the top left field. This panel displays three distinct images. A pair of dancing jesters, a figure playing a piano and two men in the background playing musical instruments and illustrates the movement of society towards valuing fine arts, music and theatre. The backdrop is also covered by skyscrapers creating another image of a city environment.  Composition  = Equality and harmony = Scenes of equality are displayed in the two rectangular panels were Krohg has depicted images of enslaved men being embraced by crowds of people from different ethnicities. In the right panel a human figure from the crowd pulls a man with Asian headgear from the beneath them, symbolising equality with people from different continents. As explained by the United Nations, \\"equality is symbolised by a group of people weighing out grain for all to share\\". = Familial bliss = The oval shaped centre panel symbolises the desire for a good family which shares compassion and harmony in the new world order. Krohg sought to encapsulate the expectations of the Security Council to \\"operate as the custodian of international order in the post-war era\\". = Restoration = The dark tones and ashes depicted in the bottom field of the artwork is symbolic of World War Two, a prevalent event which influenced Krohg's mural. As identified by the artist, \\"the essence of the idea is to give an impression of light, security and joy. The world we see in the foreground is collapsing, while the new world based on clarity and harmony can be built up\\". The image of a woman opening a window to allow sunshine into the room in the extreme left panel expresses the new harmonious world removed from forces of evil. Krohg wanted the artwork to inspire the delegates in the Security Council chamber to ensure the work of the United Nations provides the opportunity for a new and more valuable life after the tragedies of World War 2. = Faith = Throughout the mural, Krohg has combined elements from different Christian sources. Inspired by an image of Christ rising from the Catholic tradition, Krohg has created an image of a rising white Phoenix, making the mural relatable to universal audiences. Further references are made to the Greek Orthodox Church through the use of an almond shape centre panel called a mandorla, which traditionally displays sacred images.  After completion  Between April 2010 - 2013, the mural was removed to be cleaned, reassembled and redisplayed in the Security Council. Over 8.2 million US dollars was donated by the Norwegian government to assist with the renovations to the Security Council Chamber. The renovations involved replacing the original blue silk displayed in the two rectangular panels which depicted the anchor of faith, growing wheat of hope and heart of charity with the textile rayon due to the original silk shrinking.  Controversy  Several academics have questioned the neutrality of the mural, particularly its reflection on Norway. In an article for the German Review on the United Nations, Maria Sandvik raised the question of whether Norwegian Secretary- General Trygve Lie and head architect Arnstein Arneberg pressured Krohg to paint the artwork in a particular direction. Ingeborg Glambek writes that \\"it is obvious that the first UN Secretary-General, Trygve Lie of Norway was influential when the decision was made.\\" The head architect of the Security Chamber, Arneberg, has said that in his role as secretary-general, Trygve Lie exercised significant power in ensuring that \\"Krohg's painting was hung in the council chamber.\\" This controversy has been complicated by the lack of clarity around how Norway and Arneburg financed the creation of Krohg's artwork. Another controversy developed around Per Krohg's sketched design of the mural, when it was presented to a special group of the United Nations Art Panel. This committee was responsible for assessing all the art proposals for the Security Council. The panel did not initially accept Krohg's artistic concept, citing concerns that the intricacy of the artwork might distract delegates, and cause them to lose concentration. In response, the head architect, Arneburg, rejected the view of the Art Panel, emphasising that the \\"painting was very important to the effect the room would have as a window on Norwegian culture and art.\\" On January 7, 1950, a royal decree (that cost Norway 109,000 kroner) made it compulsory for the United Nations Art Panel to approve the painting.

It was designed by Joshua John Moore and built from 1830 to 1839. The property is owned by Liverpool City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Horningsea Park was one of Governor Lachlan Macquarie's large pastoral grants made following the establishment of Liverpool in the 1810s. The 500-acre property was granted to Lieutenant Joshua John Moore in 1819.Keating, 1995 The grant was conditional on 50 acres being cultivated within five years.Israel, 2012, 17 Moore was one of the few early settlers allowed to pass through the Cowpastures with cattle in 1821 to his land at Baw Baw. He was the first pastoralist to occupy land on the present site of Canberra and his is the first written mention of that name. In the 1840s Polish explorer and discoverer of Mount Kosciuszko, Pawe≈Ç Strzelecki lived at Horningsea Park. The place thus has strong links with early exploration beyond the Cumberland Plain, as well as with the early movement of the Australian economy from an agricultural to a pastoral base. Moore was a Lieutenant in the 14th Regiment of Foot and a Battle of Waterloo veteran. He arrived in NSW in 1816 and was appointed Clerk to the Judge Advocate. Horningsea Park was part of an integrated area of large pastoral grants (mainly to military or civil officers or wealthy free settlers) which stretched from Liverpool to the Nepean River. Horningsea Park escaped the subdivision of the area which took place in the 1880s boom. Moore's first residence on Horningsea Park was Cumberland Cottage, built in the 1820s. There were five employees listed as working on the property in the 1828 census: a woman servant, a boot maker, a gardener and two labourers. As well as indicating the presence of accommodation on the property at the time, a woman servant would imply a homestead. The present Horningsea House was built in the 1830s, by 1839using convict labour. An unreferenced map (1882) described by Keating shows the house, grand driveway, and an assemblage of outbuildings around the house. The Moore family sold Horningsea in 1855 to clear debts from the 1840s depressionKeating 1995 to members of the Solomon family, who gave the house its current name. Subdivision of the original 500 acre grant took place in the 1880s.Israel, 2012, 5 The house was described in 1907 as having 13 rooms and a detached kitchen and wash house at the rear. There was a large stable and buildings associated with dairying and grazing.Keating, 1995, in Israel, 2012, 18 The house underwent extensive renovations in the 1930s by Alfred Emil Schoeffel and his wife Daisy Mildred Pearse. The cellars were filled in, the (front) verandah was replaced with the present porch, the eastern part of the house was reconstructed, and some outbuildings were demolished. The Schoeffels sold Horningsea Park in the early 1950s. In 1947 the house and a sixty-acre block were separated from the remaining (612 acres of) land, which was subdivided in 1949. The 60-acre house block was later expanded to 90 acres and was bought by Lucile and Michael Polya, dairy farmers. Following the loss of its pastoral context in the 1950s, by 1960 the holding was reduced to 22 acres (9 hectares), the size and shape it remains today. It was used as a residence until 1974 when the Polyas sold the property. It had reached a derelict state by the 1970s. The house was classified by the National Trust of Australia in 1976, when it was also saved from demolition after intervention from the Minister for Planning and Liverpool Council. After many changes in ownership the house and 22 acres came into possession of a British-based company who proposed development of the site for a caravan park. Demolition had already started when a preservation order was placed over the property, but not before vandals stripped its internal fittings including cedar doors, windows and shutters, a cedar staircase and all the marble mantelpieces. The owners erected a new roof and boarded up windows and doors. The property was put up for sale in 1980. Front detail The house was stabilised, progressively reconstructed (from 1982) and what was the gutted shell was extensively renovated following its recognition as a heritage item and making of a permanent conservation order in 1983. At that time some of the outbuildings were still standing and the work included demolition of a single-storey service wing on the northern side of the house. These were visible in photographs taken prior to the reconstruction in the early 1980s.Israel, 2012, 18 In 1991 the Liverpool Heritage Study referred to sandstone and pressed-brick footings associated with former outbuildings. Footings of outbuildings were visible in 1991. As these footings were described as being of \\"machine-made bricks\\", the structures were most likely built during the twentieth century. The house today is a product of the extensive reconstruction it underwent in the early 1980s, . The floors and joinery are new, photographs of that time showing a shell. Usual areas of archaeological potential such as underfloor spaces were removed or disturbed at this time. For intents and purposes the house, except for its southern, eastern and western walls and the internal load-bearing walls, was built . The cellars date to the house's original construction. Of the original property the curtilage is now quite small. The sites of most of the property's work buildings are likely to be under the neighbouring housing subdivision. The outbuildings nearest to the house, of which the detached kitchen and wash house are specifically referred to, are likely to have been disturbed by the reconstruction works and subsequent landscaping. A cistern stands close to the house's north-west corner. It has been converted into a wine cellar. Following its reconstruction, it was used as the office of a land company managing an adjacent residential redevelopment, but returned to residential use after being sold in 1999. It was heavily renovated in 2004, with two additional wings added to the building in a design sympathetic to the heritage features. In August 2018, it was advertised for sale as either a residence or commercial premises.  Description  Long driveway Horningsea Park is a two-storey brick/rubble and stucco Georgian style house set in the remains of its former estate, still retaining the long entrance driveway from the Hume Highway. The house has been restored and reconstructed from a semi-ruinous condition, having been severely damaged in the 1970s by part-demolition.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The intact survival of Horningsea Park for so long as a large rural entity is significant testimony to its viability as a pastoral and dairying assemblage. In relation to its setting within the estate, the house retains an ability to demonstrate socially and historically significant concepts about Australian colonial and post-colonial life. The place has strong links with early exploration beyond the Cumberland Plain, as well as with the early movement of the Australian economy from an agricultural to a pastoral base. A fine early Georgian homestead, with visual evidence of its former estate and surrounded by trees some of which are from the original garden. Horningsea Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Woodward, ‚ÄúNew England‚Äôs Other Witch-hunt: The Hartford Witch-hunt of the 1660s and Changing Patterns in Witchcraft Prosecution,‚Äù OAH Magazine of History (July 2007): 16 They were the first large-scale witch trials in the American colonies, predating the Salem Witch Trials by nearly thirty years. John M. Taylor lists a total of 37 total cases, 11 of which resulted in executions. The execution of Alse Young of Windsor in the spring of 1647R.G. Tomlinson, Witchcraft Trials of Connecticut: The First Comprehensive, Documented History of Witchcraft Trials in Colonial Connecticut (Hartford: The Bond Press Inc., 1978), 4. was the beginning of the witch panic in the area, which would not come to an end until 1670 with the release of Katherine Harrison.Woodward, 19.  Witchcraft in Connecticut  The history of witchcraft in Connecticut is difficult to track, owing primarily to the lack of documentation from the accusations, trials, and executions. In the words of Benjamin Trumbull in his 1818 History of Connecticut: > ‚ÄúIt may, possibly, be thought a great neglect or matter of partiality, that > no account is given of witchcraft in Connecticut. The only reason that is, > after the most careful researches, no indictment of any person for that > crime, nor any process relative to that affair, can be found.\\"Tomlinson, > vii. Despite this, there is enough existing evidence to gain an insight into the culture of witchcraft trials at the time. In the early days of the trials, Reverends Samuel Stone of Hartford, Joseph Haynes of Wethersfield, and Samuel Hooker of Farmington served on a \\"prosecutorial tribunal\\" which contradicted the traditional idea that prosecutors should remain skeptical and immune to public pressure to convict.Woodward, 17. As was the popular belief of the time, the magistrates of Connecticut relied on evidence of \\"the devil‚Äôs involvement in inflicting harm\\" to secure a conviction of witchcraft, but such evidence could easily be found through \\"battering interrogations.\\"  Key figures  = Alse Young = Alse Young was the first person executed for witchcraft not only in Connecticut, but likely in the whole of the American colonies. On May 26, 1647, she was executed in Hartford.Tomlinson, 4. Her execution was recorded in the journals of John Winthrop the governor of Massachusetts Bay; and Matthew Grant, the second town clerk of Windsor. There are no further surviving records on Young's trial or specification of the charges against her. Around the time of the trial, an influenza epidemic occurred throughout the New England area, including her hometown of Windsor, which may have influenced the accusations against her. Young was likely married or related to John Young of Windsor, and may have been eligible to inherit his property, which may have made her an even more attractive target. = Mary Johnson = Mary Johnson's was the first recorded confession of witchcraft. She worked as a house servant and was accused of theft in 1648. After extensive torture and interrogation, Johnson confessed to \\"familiarity with the devil\\". She also confessed to having sexual relations with \\"men and devils\\" and to murdering a child. Her execution was delayed as she was pregnant during her imprisonment in Hartford. Johnson was executed June 6, 1650. = Katherine Harrison = Katherine Harrison was a former maidservant of Captain John Cullick and the widow of Wethersfield's town crier. Harrison was born in England and came to America around 1651. She became a wealthy citizen of Wethersfield, Connecticut after she inherited her husband's estate, worth one thousand pounds. Harrison experienced several legal problems, including the death of her livestock and the destruction of crops. Though her losses were supported by eyewitnesses, she received no compensation. In 1668, she was sued for slandering Goody Griswold. Between 1668 and 1669, Harrison was also accused of witchcraft. The accusations against her included breaking the Sabbath, fortune telling and using black magic, as well as appearing in spectral form to people. She was also accused of calling to the devil by the swamp. On May 11, 1669 she was moved to the local jail to await her trial. Harrison's trial faced many complications: the first jury never reached a decision, and the second found her guilty, but the magistrates disagreed as most of the evidence was spectral, which relied solely on the accuser. In May of 1670, Harrison was released from prison, and banished from the Connecticut colony; she and her family relocated to New York, as they had already planned to do.  Major sites  = Wethersfield = During the 1650s, several people were tried for witchcraft through the Connecticut area. In Wethersfield, Joan and John Carrington were executed in 1651. They were prominent members of the Wethersfield community before being accused of witchcraft. Wethersfield was also the home of Mary Johnson, the first open confessor of witchcraft; and Katherine Harrison. This resulted in the coining of the term \\"Wethersfield Witches\\" by historians. The Hartford Statehouse. People given the death penalty for witchcraft were often hanged here. = Hartford = In 1662 and 1663, the town of Hartford saw a surge in witch hysteria. A series of accusations were made among the townsfolk. The first accusation was by Anne Cole, who accused Rebecca Greensmith and Elizabeth Seager of tormenting her through magic. The parents of Elizabeth Kelly accused Goody Ayres of using black magic to kill their daughter. Other claims of black magic from Hartford were more peculiar: one person claimed Satan caused her to speak with an accent. Another said her neighbors transformed into animals at night. Katherine Branch, servant to the Wescot family, suffered from a series of fits and other instances that Daniel Wescot described as being \\"beyond nature\\", like elevating above her bed. A minister from a neighboring village claimed Branch's afflictions were the result of her declining to join a witch coven. From Hartford, four people were executed for the crime of witchcraft. Nathaniel and Rebecca Greensmith, Mary Sanford, and Mary Barnes were hung in 1662. Elizabeth Seager was accused of witchcraft, but the charges were dropped due to weak evidence.  End of the trials  By 1663, the witchcraft trials in Hartford were beginning to wind down, due in no small part to the return of the governor of the Connecticut colony, John Winthrop Jr.Woodward, 16. Winthrop was generally regarded as \\"New England‚Äôs quintessential adjudicator of witchcraft cases\\", due not only to his status as the son of the governor of Massachusetts, but also to his \\"first-hand knowledge of natural magical practices... associated with alchemy, a mystical form of chemical experimentation.\\" Because of his experience with alchemy, and having seen John Dee and Robert Fludd - two major influences in Winthrop's studies - stand against false accusations of witchcraft,Woodward, 18. Winthrop often involved himself in witchcraft cases to ensure that the accused were not executed. His return and involvement in the trials ushered in a period of increasing skepticism towards accusations of witchcraft, and in 1669, it was Winthrop's court that established that multiple witnesses needed to bear witness to the same act of witchcraft simultaneously. This significantly stemmed the flow of accusations, and despite a minor panic during the Salem crisis later, no witches were executed in Connecticut after Katherine Harrison's release in 1670.  Aftermath  On October 6, 2012, descendants of the executed petitioned the Connecticut government to posthumously pardon the victims, but the motion was not passed. In 2007, Addie Avery communicated with the British government in an attempt to acquit the convicted witches. Addie Avery was the descendant of Mary Sanford, who was executed for \\"dancing around a tree while drinking liquor\\". Avery has also been involved in many theatrical performances about the Connecticut Witch trials, like The Witching Hour. On February 6, 2017, the town of Windsor unanimously passed a resolution to symbolically clear the names of the town's two victims, Alice Young and Lydia Gilbert. A documentary about the passage of this resolution entitled Delayed Justice: Windsor Atones For Its Witch Trial History produced through Windsor Community Television can be accessed through Internet Archive. Several individuals arranged memorial services for the victims of the witch trials in Windsor in June 2017. The \\"Memorial For Connecticut's Witch Trial Victims\\" marked the 370th anniversary of Alse Young's execution.

It refers to their patriotic feelings, values and actions (be they political, socio- cultural or racial) that were born out of relations in the dual-island republic's formation.  Nation formation  Spanish migration took place in the 1600s, following slave raids that wiped out a large portion of indigenous life in Trinidad and Tobago. The first major migration to the islands began with an influx of Indian citizens migrating to Trinidad's major city, The Port of Spain, in 1845. This migration marked the first chapter of the cultural formation of the nation and of its current racial diversity. It brought new cultural, racial, political and often religious values and beliefs that conflicted and complemented the previous Spanish influences. Trinidad and Tobago received their independence on the 31st of August 1962, and the two islands have been considered a republic since that time. This foundation of the dual-island republic marked the formation of its modern-day nationalism.  Culture  The mix of nationalities, customs and culture of the modern-day republic contribute significantly to the nationalism of Trinidad and Tobago. The early Indian influence, paired with the Caribbean location and culture of the dual-island republic, made way for Creole culture largely founded upon these customs. A particularly famous Trinbagonian cultural custom, that is globally renowned as representative of West Indian culture is the Trinidad Carnival. \\"However, this cultural practice has been prevalent in Trinidad and Tobago from shortly after the cultural renaissance of post- World War 2. Trinidad and Tobago developed a rich cultural life from early colonial times, enhanced by the striking diversity of the population. Carnival, calypso and the steelband\\" (which emerged just after World War 2) were at the heart of the Creole cultural complex\\" The unique dress worn by females at the festival (feathers, gems and festive undergarments) mostly with wings) shows components of Spanish, Native American and Indian Traditional Dress. The Trinbagonian Culture is similarly grounded upon the ideals of multi-nationalism. Modern-day Calypso music originated on Trinidad and Tobago, and is derived from West African traditions of musical form and structure. It was brought there by enslaved people, and was a way of spreading ideas and recording cultural events at a time of low literacy. The Black Power movement in the 1970s spawned a number of nationalistic calypso musicians in the republic, such as Black Stalin who was known for his militant lyrics.  Race and discrimination issues  The discrimination prevalent in Trinidad and Tobago is not only between difference racial groups. For lower socio-economic groups, occupational discrimination meant lower opportunities for higher income positions and fostered the growth of the pay disparity between both racial and socio-economic groups. This discrimination became a focal contributor to the civil rights activism that branded a sector of Trinbagonian Nationalism during the 1960s. Naturally, the racial disputes and disagreements that the dual- island have with neighbouring nationals contributed to the nationalism of Trinidad and Tobago. For the dual-island, a significant nationalistic dispute is between both Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. During a course of over three decades the nations underwent diplomatic meetings. The dispute was around the distribution of maritime spaces, hydrocarbons and fisheries. It went on between the periods of 1988 to 2004 and included treaties and ended in Barbados taking the case to arbitration on February 16, 2004. The dispute was not only political, it also drove a wedge socially and culturally between the nations that resulted in higher levels of low grade crime.  Evolution  The evolution of culture, politics and media play into the way in which the nationalism of Trinidad and Tobago plays an individual role in the way in which the nation is viewed currently in both its nationalism and as a nation state. The evolution of social and cultural issues act as an indication of the nationalistic evolution. These national issues that have either evolved or more recently come into relevance are an indication of this. A primary issue in the current climate in Trinidad and Tobago is around female rights and sexual rights. The negotiation for sex rights and reduced discrimination begun, being prevalent, for Trinidad and Tobago, in the 1960s. This largely meant establishing more legitimate legal and political grounding for the rights and freedoms of those with female bodies, surrounding civil and sexual issues. Similarly, in 2018, the previous political ban on same sex intimacy was overturned on April 13 of 2018.\\"section 13 of Trinidad and Tobago‚Äôs Sexual Offenses Act punishes ‚Äúbuggery,‚Äù or anal intercourse, punishable by sentences of up to 25 years in prison. Section 16 of the same act, on ‚Äúserious indecency,‚Äù stipulates that a person who is sexually intimate with a person of the same sex without having intercourse is liable to imprisonment for up to five years.\\" As the culture around same sex rights evolves, with it the values, principles and beliefs evolve; the nationalism of the Trinbagonian region. This is a major representation of nationalism in that the cultural and social issues that a nation concerns itself with, majorly reflect upon what the nation stands for; henceforth its nationalism.

The Myanmar peace process refers to the nation led discussions aimed at relieving the internal armed conflict that has been simmering in Myanmar since before it gained independence from Britain in 1948. Many of the events that have taken place can be attributed to tensions surrounding the treatment of the numerous different ethnic minorities. This conflict involves both the Myanmar government and military (the Tatmadaw), and the 16 armed ethnic minorities in Myanmar. In recent years tension between the Myanmar government and the military has been increasing, with the military still holding position as the most powerful political force in Myanmar. Since the National League of Democracy came to power in 2015 under Aung San Suu Kyi, the peace process has been positioned as a major priority of the government to end the conflict. It is a key aspect of the country's transition to democracy, and has involved negotiations amongst the different armed ethnic groups, the Tatmadaw, and the government, culminating in events such as the Panglong Peace Conferences, and National Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). Dr. Sai Oo from the Pyidaungsu Institute states that the peace process, and the road to peace in Myanmar, will not be a smooth one.  Background  The beginning of the ethnic armed conflict in Myanmar can be traced back to just before its independence from Britain in 1948, and has been labelled one of the most challenging issues the country has faced since then. The conflict escalated when military rule began in Burma (now Myanmar) in 1958 under Prime Minister Ne Win. Since independence, there have been issues relating to the differing ethnicities and groups residing in Myanmar, and their fight for equal treatment, stability, and social, political and cultural rights. They have faced issues such as forced relocation, underdevelopment in areas in which they reside, and high levels of poverty. The conflict has caused high levels of internal displacement, casualties, and social and economic issues. Alongside this, there have been issues surrounding Government accountability and the need for democracy. Despite many of these issues affecting all Burmese citizens, according to Burma Link, the ethnic minorities of Myanmar have been impacted the most.  Key events in the political timeline since 1947  See also for earlier timeline: Post- independence Burma, 1948-62 = 1947 - First Constitution = The First Panglong Peace Conference took place, to discuss the status of citizens post independence, and Myanmar enacted its first Constitution as an independent country. Under its Constitution, a bicameral legislature was created, with power residing with the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Along with this, the Shan, Kachin, Kayin, Kayah and Chin states were created in the non-Burmese areas of Myanmar. = 1948 - Independence from Britain = Burma gained independence from Britain on 4 January 1948 and came under the prime ministerial power of foreign minister U Nu. Ten years later, in 1958, the military took power under politician Ne Win. = 1962 - Military coup and creation of socialist state = In March 1962 a military coup was led by Burmese politician Ne Win, and the Burma Socialist Programme Party was established in an attempt to create a socialist state, removing the representative democracy that had been present since 1948. During this time the federal system was abolished and the rise of a one-party military system occurred. Internal conflicts and tensions rose between the citizens and the military as the ethnic minorities were unwilling to accept the demands of dictator Ne Win. = 1974 - New Constitution = Myanmars second Constitution was established by the military after the coup in 1962. Under the new Constitution, a number of changes were made including the nationalisation of Burma's major enterprises, the shift to a socialist democracy with more power given to the military, and the adoption of a single party system, which recognised the Myanmar Socialist party as the only legitimate party. = 1988-1990 - Burma to Myanmar = In 1988, General Ne Win resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In the following year, Burma was renamed Myanmar by the military government, and the name of the capital was changed from Rangoon to Yangon. In 1990, the National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi won the election. However, the outcome of the election was ignored by the military government which placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest. = 1993 - Attempted peace negotiations = Under the State Peace and Development Council, meetings were arranged between ethnic armed groups, the military and the Government to negotiate peace. Although certain agreements were achieved, such as that between the Kachin Independence Organisation which ended a 30-year war, many of them later unravelled. During this year, the Government started a national constitutional convention to debate constitutional changes, which would continue for a further 14 years. = 2003 - 2004 Khin Nyunt and end to Karen National Union conflict = In 2003, Khin Nyunt became Prime Minister and, in an effort to lead Myanmar to a democracy, proposed a new constitution. Within a short time, he was removed from power. The following year, the Burmese Government and one of the largest armed ethnic groups in Myanmar, the Karen National Union, agreed to end the conflict between them. = 2007 - UN Security Council draft resolution = In an attempt to prevent further persecution of citizens by the Burmese Government, a draft US resolution was proposed at the UN Security Council, although it was vetoed by Russia and China. The Government was also accused by the Red Cross of breaching the rights of its people. Following 14 years of the national convention, the military put an end to the constitutional discussion that had commenced in 1993. = 2008 - New constitution proposal = A new constitution was proposed by the Myanmar Government, which gave special privileges to the military. This included the ability to displace the president in an emergency and prevent the leader of the National League of Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, from gaining power. This constitution was voted in, following a referendum in mid-2008. = 2011 - 2013 - U Thein Sein and peace process launch = After being elected in March 2011, President U Thein Sein attempted to connect with the citizens of Myanmar by allowing peaceful demonstrations, in an attempt to try and negotiate a lasting peace and, during this period, with support from the international community, the current peace process began. At the end of 2011, the military was ordered by the Government to stop fighting the Kachin rebels, and in early 2012, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the two parties. By early 2013, there were numerous bilateral ceasefire agreements signed by the main groups and the government, and in late 2013, the Nationwide Ceasefire Coordination Team was formed. = 2014 - Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement draft = Drafts of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), an agreement promoting long term peace negotiations between the armed ethnic minorities and the Government, were combined into a single text. This text involved seven chapters outlining the implementation and monitoring of ceasefires, as well as a road map for the peace process that was expected to follow. = 2015 - Signing of the NCA = Ahead of the upcoming constitutional referendum, the Government withdrew the Rohingya Muslims from voting, excluding them as citizens. The NCA was agreed upon between the Government and 16 of the armed ethnic groups, although in October only eight groups, the Government and the Tatmadaw signed the NCA. = 2016 - Union Peace Conference (21st Century Panglong Conference) = Htin Kyaw became President and after 50 years of military domination over the Government, a democracy movement began to take place. On 31 August, the first session of the Union Peace Conference, 21st Century Panglong, began and later in the year, the National League to Democracy was sworn into power with Aung Sang Suu Kyi as leader. = 2017 - Rohingya Crisis = The UN Human Rights Council started an investigation into the treatment of a small ethnic minority in Myanmar, the Rohingya Muslims, and the ways in which it had been targeted for persecution and forced relocation. Nearly 700,000 Rohingya people have been forced out of their homes in the Rakhine state of Myanmar, and across the border into neighbouring country, Bangladesh. This, according to BBC News, is due to the denial of citizenship for this people, as well as their exclusion from important political decisions, such as the 2014 census. = 2018 - Recent events = The UN initiated an investigation into the treatment of the Rohingya Muslims by the Myanmar military. The outcome of this investigation revealed the military had been carrying out war crimes and genocide against the Rohingya people. As a result, six generals are to be trialled at the International Criminal Court, and alongside this, leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been accused of failing to use her power to protect the citizens of Myanmar. In July 2018, the third session of the Union Peace Conference was held, and those ethnic minorities who are not already signatory to the NCA were encouraged to sign.  Past attempts at, and steps towards, peace  There have been numerous attempts made by the Myanmar Government to promote long lasting peace and democracy, and end the ongoing conflict between the armed ethnic minorities and the military. Since 2011, discussions have been taking place amongst the armed ethnic groups, military and government, although there are still gender, federal and ethnic rights issues that need to be resolved. The First Panglong Peace Conference took place in early 1947, and was a meeting between the leader of Myanmar, General Aung San and the leaders of a number of the ethnic divisions including Kachin, Shan and Chin to discuss the status of upcoming independent Myanmar. The Agreement created at the conference proposed a promise that the Burmese government was to fulfil, which would provide the ethnic minorities with autonomy and established the Union of Burma. The Second Panglong Peace Conference followed this on 6 February, and was attended by the government and delegates from the Shan and Kachin states. Outcomes from this conference included the agreement of internal autonomy for these states, as well as the union of Burma. The Panglong Agreement that was created by these two conferences was signed on 12 February 1947 by all those in attendance. Other minor agreements that attempted peace between ethnic minorities and the government include the 1989 United Wa State Army agreement, the 1994 Kachin Independence Organisation Agreement, and the 1995 New Mon State Party agreement. In August 2011, President U Thein Sein began the Call for Peace, in which he invited the armed ethnic minorities of Myanmar to begin peace talks with the government. During this time, the government also began to formalise agreements that had previously only been verbal. Following this, in November 2013, the Nationwide Ceasefire Coordination Team was formed to represent the armed ethnic minorities in discussions with the government and first represented them at a summit in Laiza at the Kachin Independence Organisation headquarters. A significant step towards achieving peace between the different parties of the conflict is the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), that was drafted in 2014. After being agreed upon by 16 different ethnic armed groups, the agreement was drawn up and signed at a ceremony in 2015. Despite the initial support, only 8 of the ethnic groups ended up signing the agreement, with the others either choosing not to sign, or being disqualified by the government.  Current attempts at peace process  Leader of the National League for Democracy in Myanmar, Aung Sang Suu Kyi, at the 21st Century Panglong Conference. There is a constant ongoing focus on peace in Myanmar, with the most recent peace process directed at ending the conflict between the 21 ethnic armed minorities and the Myanmar Government, with an overarching aim of creating a democratic, federal state. The first session of the Union Peace Conference or the 21st Century Panglong Conference first took place on August 31, 2016 in Naypyidaw, Myanmar. The first two sessions of this conference had little impact on resolving the differences and ongoing conflict. According to Lin Let Kyae Sin, this may be due to the fact that peace talks are taking place while the 2008 constitution is still in place, one that solidifies the military power over Burmese citizens. The most recent session of this conference took place in July 2018 and involved encouraging those armed ethnic groups who were not already signatories of the NCA, to become a part of the peace process. This conference mainly addressed the ways in which a federal democratic system could be established in Myanmar, and had a focus on equality, the involvement of citizens in the peace making process, and the best ways to achieve agreements on the peace process. Although peace was a key aim of these discussions, attention was directed away from this due to concerns surrounding the current armed ethnic conflict, particularly in the Shan and Kachin states.

It is located on East Maui Volcano's east rift zone, at the border between HƒÅna Forest Reserve and HaleakalƒÅ National Park. It is alleged to be one of the wettest places on earth, with a reported annual rainfall of for the period 1992-2018. Climate The Big Bog has a Tropical rainforest climate (Af), with no observable dry season and nearly constant torrential rainfall. Prior to the establishment of the station there in 1992, rainfall for Big Bog was estimated at around 4,600 mm (180 inches) per year. However, the first full year of recorded data showed 13,995 mm (551 inches) of rainfall, which is one of the highest annual rainfall totals measured in the Hawaiian Islands. Since then, the annual average has been recorded as . Clear days are essentially nonexistent, and even when it isn't raining, it is almost certainly cloudy or foggy. The lack of adequate drainage has caused moisture to accumulate, forming the bog. =Causes= The Big Bog lies at , very close to the trade wind inversion layer, leading to persistent transport of moisture rich air by the northeast trade winds up the steep mountain slopes. These trade winds condense to form clouds and precipitation. Its moniker as the cloudiest place in the Hawaiian Islands is verified by the fact that its average solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration are the lowest amongst recorded locations, and relative humidity and cloud attenuation are the highest. Comparison with Mount Wai ªale ªale While the summit of Mount Wai ªale ªale has long been considered the wettest place in the Hawaiian Islands, and thus Oceania, the Big Bog has a higher 30-year average. NOAA reports Wai‚Äôale‚Äôale's annual rainfall as 373.85 inches (9495.8mm), while the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa reports the Big Bog's as 404.3 inches, or 10,271 mm.

It was designed by Francis Greenway and built from 1818 to 1820 by James Smith. The property is owned by the Anglican Parish of Liverpool and is the oldest still existing Anglican church in Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Commissioned by Governor Lachlan Macquarie and designed by Francis Greenway, St Luke's Church was built in 1818‚Äì1819 as part of Macquarie's establishment plan for the town of Liverpool. It was the smallest of the three major church designs commissioned by Macquarie from Greenway, the others being St James' Church in Sydney and St Matthew's Anglican Church in . A rectory was built about the same time but was replaced in 1840. The site for Liverpool was marked out by Macquarie in 1810. St Luke's was one of the original public buildings for the town. Its foundation stone was laid in 1818. Its original builder Nathaniel Lucas died at an early stage and the job was taken over by James Smith. Rev. Robert Cartwright was the first Minister and the first service was held on St. Luke's Day, 18 October 1819. Governor Macquarie attended a service in December 1820. The building was not fully completed until the early 1820s. A rectory and school building, since demolished, were built close by. The oldest extant associated building on the site is the church hall, part of which dates from the 1840s. Rev. James Walker, described by William Woolls as \\"one of the most learned men who ever came to the colonies\\", was an Oxford MA, had been chaplain at George Town, Van Diemen's Land, before William Broughton appointed him to the new incumbency of Marsfield and the headmastership of The King's School in 1843. Walker had studied botany in Europe, but neither published, wrote, described any species, assembled any collection, or performed any task by which posterity is able to judge the quality of any botanical labour he undertook. Walker's stay in Parramatta was not long. He left in 1847 to become the rector of St. Luke's at Liverpool. It was from the Rev. Walker, Woolls said that he had \\"first imbibed a taste for Australian botany\\". As a consequence, Woolls would earn for himself a place among the distinguished Australian botanists of the 19th century. The interior was completed in 1824. Various additions and modifications were made to the church over the years. The chancel was added in 1857, and the porch on the north side, formerly supported by four timber columns, was enclosed in 1860. The vestries were added in the 1890s. A gallery was added at an unknown date, but was later removed. Greenway's original portico on the north side was replaced by a brick porch in the 1870s but this, in turn, was replaced by a replica of the original portico in 1923. An oversight was noticed during the 1956 centenary of consecration when it was seen that the church had not been consecrated in 1856. The church was subject to a major restoration between 1975 and 1978.  Description  St Luke's Anglican Church is a Georgian brick church with tower, portico and additional chancel and vestries, set in open grounds in the centre of Liverpool. The clock in the tower is rare in Australia, being one of three Thwaites & Reed (UK) clocks in Australia, sent (gifted) by King George III (one in Parramatta at the Parramatta Female Factory one in Hobart).Brown, 2002 The grounds contain some recent paving, but is otherwise mainly open and grassed, with mature lemon scented gums (Corymbia citriodora), stringybarks (Eucalyptus crebra), bloodwoods (Corymbia sp.), and a kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum). The church was reported to be in good condition as of 8 April 1998.  Heritage listing  Side view of the church St Luke's Anglican Church is evidence of Governor Macquarie's initiatives in opening up settlement in New South Wales. It is one of the three oldest surviving Anglican churches in Australia, and a fine example of Francis Greenway's public architecture in New South Wales. It is widely regarded with St James' Church, Sydney and St Matthew's Anglican Church, Windsor as a \\"foundation\\" colonial church. The clock in the tower is a Thwaites & Reed clock, one of five sent as a gift from King George IV (the others being in the Parramatta Female Factory, St. John's Parramatta, St. Matthew's Windsor and in Hobart). St Luke's Anglican Church Group, as part of Macquarie's original survey of Liverpool, demonstrates the history of the early settlement of the city and is a physical link to the character of the early township. It also demonstrates the history of the Anglican Church from the early establishment of the Colony from which period it has been a centre for local worship. The group is associated with many key Colonial figures, including the Architect Francis Greenway and is representative of his early colonial architectural style. Located within the heart of Liverpool the group is a historic, aesthetically pleasing landmark in an otherwise modernised city centre. It is one of only three surviving early Anglican churches in the country. There is the potential to gain more information on the site from further architectural, archaeological and documentary research.

Trevino was a political trailblazer and one of the most prominent Hispanics in Austin for years. He was known for his lifelong public service. Trevi√±o was part of a coalition that ended the exclusive grip of Anglo power in the city of Austin. Early Life and Service Trevi√±o was born in Austin and at age 8 volunteered to become a Catholic altar boy. He worked at a laundry, did odd jobs and made deliveries for a local blueprint company. His family had always had a modest income, but after he volunteered for a Catholic service group, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, his eyes were opened to the poverty around him. At age 17 Trevi√±o volunteered for the army and trained as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. He became a paid anti-poverty worker, the first at the East First Neighborhood Center, when he was 27. In the Austin community of Montopolis Trevi√±o partnered with a local Catholic priest, Father Underwood, to operate a VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) program that had been newly created as part of the War on Poverty initiative. Austin Political Power In the early 1970s, Trevi√±o, Gus Garcia, Richard Moya and Gonzalo Barrientos were known by journalists as the \\"Young Turks\\" or the \\"Brown Machine\\" according to Gus Garcia. These Hispanic leaders, along with a coalition that included labor activists, African-Americans, and young voters, overturned the traditional Anglo businessmen based power structure of Austin. City Council In 1973 Trevi√±o sought a seat on the Austin City Council but lost. In 1975 he was elected and went on to serve thirteen years. He contributed to a number of improvements while on the City Council, such as, started clinics across the city to provide access to health care for the poor; created what would become the Department of Small and Minority Business Resources; supported women and minorities to be included on city commissions and boards; and established a review of hiring practices to provide fair access to city jobs for minorities and women. He also helped resolve conflicts with the vendors at the Renaissance Market on Guadalupe Street. In 1978 he became the mayor pro tem, and in 1983 he served for three months as acting mayor when then mayor Carole Keeton was appointed to the State Board of Insurance. In 1983, Trevi√±o received 59,905 votes for his re-election, which is the most votes ever received by an Austin City Council candidate. Service After City Council The University of Texas School of Social Work nominated Trevi√±o to go to an International Conference on Social Welfare in Helsinki, Finland. He was one of 13 Americans invited. After scandals at the Capital Metro board of directors Trevino was elected to help clean it up. He served on the board from 1997 to 2009. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Greater Austin Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and he served on the International Board of the U.S./Mexico Sister Cities Association.

It was designed by Varney Parkes and built from 1882 to 1883. It is also known as Queens College. The property is owned by Liverpool City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 May 2005.  History  Rosebank was built in 1882‚Äì83 by Varney Parkes for his new wife, Mary Cameron Murray, daughter of the then owner of the land. Parkes was an architect, local and state politician, and son of Sir Henry Parkes. In 1883, it was sold to Louis Haigh, who was involved in the wool scouring business and was mayor of the Municipality of Liverpool. It was later owned or rented by a number of prominent people, including Henrietta and Martin Christiansen from 1908 to 1911. The Christiansens owned a brick-making business; Martin was an alderman for 30 years and mayor of Liverpool in 1900. The back verandah was probably infilled in the early twentieth century. It was purchased by Rev. William Bain in 1929 for Queens College, a boarding school for girls and later, for boys, which commenced operation in that year. During this time the rear two-storey structure was built. The school ceased operation in 1957 and the building reverted to its historical name of Rosebank. From 1958 to 1973, it was used as a male boarding house. In 1974, it was purchased by Liverpool City Council and used for community-based offices and meeting rooms. The rear addition was renovated in 1974 with the removal of the external stairs. At the same time, a weatherboard structure on the west boundary was also demolished. In 2018, it is used by sexual abuse counselling and support organisation Rosebank.  Description  Louis Haish portico Rosebank is a two-storey Victorian Italianate villa with a tower, asymmetrical planning and neoclassical details. Constructed of rendered brickwork with string courses, heavily framed windows and doors of semicircular heads with keystones, fluted pilasters, cornices and ornamental eaves brackets. There are also some crenellated walls attached to the tower and the end of the verandah. The property has both front and rear gardens, the latter relatively densely planted. The front garden contains mature trees including (hanging over the front fence) a jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), mature eucalypts (Eucalyptus sp.), a Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and a Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis). The Jacaranda, palm and Bunya are all on the front lawn. The verandah runs across the width of the street elevation and returns down each side elevation. It has cast iron columns, balustrade, frieze panels and bullnosed roof. The roof is steeply pitched in a hipped form, originally slate but now sheeted in corrugated steel roofing. The main entrance to the verandah is framed by a small pedimented porch with a decorative element of the initials \\"LH\\", representing the early owner Louis Haigh. The entry porch features geometric encaustic tiles and a stained glass window. The windows are generally timber double hung, with the windows to the main room being full height. The interior features are lath and plaster ceilings with elaborate cornices and ceiling rose, plastered brick walls, large moulded timber skirting, marble fireplaces with cast iron inserts and four panelled doors. The stairs have turned timber balustrades and the floors are covered in carpet tiles. A two-storey brick addition is attached to the west rear side of the building, but is in poor structural condition. It was built mid-20th century and was renovated in 1974. The building is generally intact, with much of the original details in good condition. There has been significant termite activity in the floor structure, both at ground floor and first floor. It has been proposed to demolish the rear addition. Rosebank as a house has integrity because its original features are largely intact and in good condition. However, Rosebank's aspect, setting and curtilage have been significantly diminished by subdivision and medium density development in the immediate vicinity of the house.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Rosebank is considered to be State heritage significance for its association with the life and works of the architect, politician and Postmaster-General, Varney Parkes (1857‚Äì1935). Varney Parkes, the son of Sir Henry Parkes, was a Liverpool Council Alderman, State Parliamentarian (1885‚Äì1913), Postmaster-General (1889‚Äì1899) and successful architect. Parkes who trained under the Colonial Architect, James Barnet between 1878 and 1880 established a successful architectural practice with C. H. E. Blackman and was responsible for the design of a wide range of buildings over much of urban and rural New South Wales, including hotels, warehouses, banks, commercial premises and domestic residences. Rosebank is a rare surviving example of the residential work of Varney Parkes. Significantly, Rosebank was designed by Parkes () for himself and his bride Mary Cameron Murray, and demonstrates the architectural devices used to convey wealth and status, as well as the use of pattern books in the spread of architectural ideas throughout the colonies. Rosebank is considered to be of local heritage significance as a grand, relatively unaltered, architect-designed and -built Victorian villa. In addition, Rosebank is the only large Victorian house remaining in the historic Liverpool Township and is held in high esteem by the local community. Rosebank has associations with many of the most prominent families of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Liverpool. The changing pattern of its use, from a family residence to a school indicates changing economic patterns within the local community. Liverpool was one of the earliest rural settlements in the State and Rosebank is a rare survival illustrating a further, industrial stage in Liverpool's development. Rosebank is also significant for its twentieth-century use as a girl's boarding school and later as a men's boarding house. As a school, Rosebank contributed to the cultural life of twentieth-century Liverpool. A collection of moveable heritage has been established, documenting the day to day running of the school. In addition to the house, the garden retains some original Victorian plantings, including mature Bunya Pines. The form of the building, as well as the associated planting, makes it a local landmark. Rosebank is one of a handful of properties, including nearby Del Rose and Collingwood, which can be used to interpret Liverpool's pastoral, industrial and commercial history.NSW Heritage Office, 2005 Rosebank was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 May 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Rosebank is of Local heritage significance for its association with a number of notable families, including Murray, Parkes, Haigh, Rougier and Christiansen, who developed industries and businesses that have had a significant impact on the development of Liverpool and to a lesser extent, the trading culture of the Sydney basin. Rosebank was located adjacent to a number of significant local industries and may have been chosen by these families as a grand residence for its convenient location. Its use as a school has also contributed to the cultural life of Liverpool.Otto Cserhalmi & Partners Pty Ltd Architects 2001 & NSW Heritage Office 2005 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Rosebank is of State heritage significance for its association with the life and works of the architect, politician and Postmaster-General, Varney Parkes (1857‚Äì1935). Varney Parkes, the son of Sir Henry Parkes, was a Liverpool Council Alderman, State Parliamentarian (1885‚Äì1913), Postmaster-General (1889‚Äì1899) and successful architect. Parkes who trained under the Colonial Architect, James Barnet between 1878 and 1880 established a successful architectural practice with C. H. E. Blackman, and was responsible for the design of a wide range of buildings over much of urban and rural New South Wales, including hotels, warehouses, banks, commercial premises and domestic residences. Rosebank is a rare surviving example of the residential work Varney Parkes. Significantly, Rosebank was designed by Parkes ( 1883) for himself and his bride Mary Cameron Murray, and demonstrates the architectural devices used to convey wealth and status, as well as the use of pattern books in the spread of architectural ideas throughout the colonies. Rosebank is of Local heritage significance for its association with a number of notable people, including the Murray, Parkes, Haigh, Rougier and Christiansen families. These families have been associated with the industrial and political development of Liverpool during the last decades of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the 20th century. Having been used as a school during the period from 1929 to 1957, Rosebank became an important institution for a generation of students in the Liverpool area and continues to have an association for former students.NSW Heritage Office 2005 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Rosebank is of Local heritage significance as a fine example of Victorian Italianate residential architecture and is representative of this style of design during its era. Rosebank is the only surviving Victorian 'Gentlemen's Residence' in the Liverpool area. Given its rarity, its contrast with the surrounding buildings and significant landscape plantings, it has a landmark quality for the Liverpool area. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Rosebank is of Local heritage significance for its association with Queens College, which operated on the site between 1929 and 1957. As other buildings associated with the College have been demolished, Rosebank is the only link with the school for its former pupils. The Haigh and Christiansen families were associated with the political and industrial development of Liverpool. As the building is the only example of its type in Liverpool, Rosebank represents an important link between the earlier colonial Georgian houses and the 20th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rosebank is of Local heritage significance as it contributes to an understanding of the pattern of development and subdivision of Liverpool during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Few could afford to maintain large houses such as Rosebank in the region during the 20th century, hence the use of such a building as a school or subdivision into flats was common. Rosebank contributes to an understanding of the contrast between a 'Gentlemen's Residence' and the neighbouring workers' cottages. The understanding extends to the use of materials in this type of building as well as how a garden of that time was planted.Otto Cserhalmi & Partners Pty Ltd Architects 2001 & NSW heritage Office 2005 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rosebank is of Local heritage significance as a rare, if not the only, local example of this type of building from the Victorian era in Liverpool. As a former Gentlemen's Residence, it demonstrates a way of life that no longer exists or is affordable. Other examples of this type and size of residence such as Drummond House, Forbesville and Sophienberg have all been demolished. Its surviving original plantings are unique within the Liverpool Central Business District. Its use as a boarding school, unusual for a single dwelling, is a rare use within the local area. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Rosebank is of Local heritage significance as a fine and largely intact example of its building type. It has all the characteristics of its representative type. As a rare example of its era, it is an important part of a unique group of existing residences in Liverpool that illustrate the range of housing types through the 19th century and early 20th century, from Collingwood to Dela Rosa.

It is now home to Kunsth√∏jskolen, a folk high school specializing in art programmes. Holb√¶k Ladeg√•rd was for centuries a home farm under Holb√¶k Castle, which was built to protect Holb√¶k and was held in fee by royal vassals. History The estate is first mentioned in 1199 in a letter of gift from Bishop Absalon in which he grants it to Sor√∏ Abbey. Holb√¶k later developed into a small market town, which Holb√¶k Castle was built to defend during troubled times. The castle was held in fee by royal vassals and Holb√¶k Ladeg√•rd served as the administrative center of the land. The estate was pawned several times and for a while referred to as the Duchy of Holb√¶k. Christoffer Festenberg Pax was granted the land in 1563 and farmed it until his death in 1608. He constructed a new home farm at the Castle but it later fell into neglect. A new home farm was finally built after a report in 1627 described the old one as \\"dilapidated\\". Holb√¶k Castle was destroyed by Swedish troops in 1659. The castle was not rebuilt but Holb√¶k Ladeg√•rd with its tenant farms was instead sold to Henrik Thott, the owner of Boltinggaard. He ran into economic difficulty and had to sell the estate in 1667. The new owner was Bertel Bartholin, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, but he soon sold it again. The estate then changed hands many times. The estate was purchased by Gregers Juel in 1706. His son, Peder Juel, sold it to Hans Hansen Seidelin in 1752. He was already the owner of nearby Hagestedg√•rd. He had no male heirs and the two estates were therefore entailed to his nephew, Hans Diderich de Brinck-Seidelin. It was the intention that he should create a stamhus for future generations of the Brinck-Seidelin famiy. The legal effect of a stamhus was that the estate could neither be sold nor divided between several heirs. Brinck-Seidelin purchased Eriksholm in 1753 and the stamhus was finally established from the three estates in 1769. Brinck-Seidelin's son, Hans de Brinck-Seidelin, inherited the estates in 1772. He demolished the old buildings of the three estates and replaced them with a single one at a new site in 1798. The stamhus was dissolved with royal approbation in 1809. Holb√¶k Ladeg√•rd was then sold to Hans Peder Kofoed, a merchant and shipowner from Copenhagen. His widow took over the estate after his death in 1812. She managed it with great skill during the agricultural crisis of the 1820s. After her death in 1839, it was acquired by F. V. Rottb√∏ll. He sold most of the tenant farms to the tenant farmers. The remaining part of the estate was sold at auction after his death. The buyer was Baron Herman Frederik L√∏venskiold. The estate then changed hands several times before it was purchased by Paul Dahl in 1913. He commissioned the architect Thorvald J√∏rgensen to refurbish the main building and also expanded the farm buildings. Paul Dahl's son sold the estate to Holb√¶k Municipality in 1962. The land was then sold off in lots for new housing while the buildings and park were turned into a folk high school.

She was a lecturer within the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Hoffman was born in New York state, but became identified with the white-ribbon movement in Kansas City, Missouri, giving up her position as principal of a school to enter its ranks. Under her leadership, Missouri became one of the best organized of states, while her growing power and popularity as a leader were evidenced by the fact that for five years of her state presidency, there was not one ballot cast against her. At the Chicago Convention in 1893, she was made Assistant Recording Secretary, and at Cleveland, 1894, chosen Recording Secretary to succeed Lillian M. N. Stevens. Early years and education Clara Cleghorn was born in De Kalb, New York, January 18, 1831. She was the eleventh child in a family of thirteen children, seven daughters and six sons. She was the daughter of Humphrey Cleghorn, a Scotchman. He was an abolitionist and a conductor on the famous \\"underground railroad\\" in the anti-slavery days. Her mother was Olive Ruruham, daughter of Major Elisha Burnham, who bore an honorable part in the Revolutionary War. She received her education in New York and Massachusetts. Career In 1861, she married Dr. Goswin Hoffman, a German physician. For twelve years, she was principal of Lathrop School in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1882, she was appointed, by the general officers of the National WCTU, president of the Missouri WCTU, Frances E. Willard having visited Kansas City to look over the ground and having learned of the mental powers and vigorous executive talents of Hoffman, her success as a teacher, her remarkable voice and elocutionary training, and her earnest Christianity. At that time, one of the leading merchants in the city, in whose home Willard was entertained, said to her: \\"If you have come here to speak and organize a Woman's Christian Temperance Union, you are welcome, hut if you have come to spirit away Mrs. Clara Hoffman from our schools, then I, as a member of the school board, have a controversy with you, however cordially I may treat you as my guest.\\" But Hoffman had felt inspired to join the crusade movement, and she left an assured position. It was within a year well-managed, and in 1883, being duly elected by the State convention, Hoffman left her position and entered upon the work. Front that time on, the work in Missouri, which had been playfully railed \\"poor old Misery\\" by the white-ribboners, forged forward, until it attained a position hardly-second to that of any State in the Union. Every town and village had its local association. Hoffman's labor was almost incessant. She rallied the forces with the skill of a major-general, drilling them with the thoroughness that her long experience as a teacher had caused to become second nature, and inspiring them with zeal. No woman has been better loved by her associates. Headquarters were established in Kansas City, where systematic work was planned. Temperance sentiment was cultivated. Improved legislation on many lines was secured, and the good work continued with Hoffman at the head. Her powers as a speaker, her strength in debate on the floor of the National WCTU convention, caused her to become a national leader, and a national organizer. She was one of its fittest survivals, by sheer force of intellect, pluck and devotion. She was in demand from Maine to California, and made endless trips, speaking and organizing. Her powers upon the platform were greatly developed. The courage and vigor with which she attacked conservatism made her a tremendous power before an audience. She was the delegate of the National WCTU at the Woman's Council in Washington, D.C. To her was given the honor of being one of the most honored delegates at the London Convention. Hoffman has two sons. Shed died February 13, 1908 in Kansas City of pneumonia.

It was designed by David Lennox and built from 1836 by convict labour, directed by Captain W. H. Christie. It is also known as Bourke's Dam. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 August 2010.  History  Some 40,000 years before European settlement of this region of the Georges River, this land was occupied by the Darug people and the neighbouring Tharawal and Gandangara peoples. The land was known as Gunyungalung. The Georges River has been seen by some as the natural (east-west) boundary between the Darug, or \\"woods\\" tribe, (north of the river and east to the coast); the \\"coast\\" tribes of the Tharawal (south of the river and east to the coast) and the Gandangara (west of the river, inland). Others argue that the region around Liverpool (where the river runs generally west to Botany Bay) signifies an important north‚Äìsouth cultural divide between the Darug peoples living north of the river and the Tharawal to the south of the river. The river demarcated rather than divided groups, providing an \\"important corridor of mobility\\" that enabled transport, communication, economic and cultural interaction up, down and across the river on light, rapid bark canoes. The Georges River area first felt the impact of European settlement in the 1790s when early settlers around the Parramatta area sought out fertile soils for cultivation, moving south along Prospect Creek to the alluvial flats around Liverpool. Facing the steep banks and sandstone cliffs of sections of the Georges River, settlement penetrated slowly in the 1790s. From the early 1800s the area saw Aboriginal hostilities against settler intrusions with raids on settler crops and stock led first by Pemulwuy of the Bediagal (until his death in 1804, likely at the hands of settlers). Some prominent settlers, who argued that the smaller settlers were the aggressors, themselves sought communication and interaction with Aboriginals, employing them as shepherds and allowing them to remain on the fringes of their landholding. Governor King's 1801 edict, however, prevented settlers harbouring Aboriginal peoples thus effectively excluding Aboriginals from the settled areas. Following the Appin massacre of 1816 the Gandagara and Tharwal kept their distance from the settlers, but they remained around the Georges River. Governor Macquarie's policy was two-pronged. He authorised settlers around the Georges River to take action against Aboriginal raiders and later instructed the military to make pre-emptive strikes. He also sought conciliation, meeting with the Tharawal when he toured the Cow Pastures in 1810. Kogi of the Tharawal was one who met with Macquarie and who, like other Tharawal, developed close relationships with settlers around the Liverpool area. In 1816 Macquarie issued a call to Aboriginals of the Georges River to lay down arms in return for food, education and secure title to land in the Liverpool area. Kogi was one who took up this option, receiving a King Plate from Macquarie which identified him as \\"King of the Georges River\\". Land grants were the only means of effecting land transfer prior to the 1850 legislation that reserved Crown land exclusively \\"for the use of Aborigines\\". There are few records of land grants to Aboriginals arising out of the 1816 agreement but there is anecdotal evidence of Aboriginal freehold land along the Georges River until the late 20th century. In 1810 the Liverpool area was the frontier of settlement, with its alluvial and clay soils increasingly being cleared for farming. Small farming enclaves characterised the area around Liverpool which Governor Macquarie proclaimed on 2 November 1810 as the first of his new towns. The first land grants followed. Partly because of Aboriginal hostilities the area did not take off for settlement, however, until the 1830s. The construction of Liverpool Weir in 1836 would have impacted on the different Aboriginal groups' use of the river as a communication channel. Construction of the weir would also have gradually changed the ecology of the river upstream. Liverpool Weir was constructed in 1836 to supply water to local farmers and the town of Liverpool and to serve as a causeway across the George's River. It was designed by David Lennox, master mason, Superintendent of Bridges for the colony of NSW and Australia's first major bridge builder. Before arriving in Australia in 1832, David Lennox, master mason, had occupied responsible positions in Britain for more than twenty years, working on many bridges including the Menai Suspension Bridge over the Menai Strait and the Over Bridge over the Severn River at Gloucester. Lennox was appointed by Governor Brisbane as Superintendent of Bridges for the colony of New South Wales in 1833. Lennox also undertook many other civil engineering works in NSW from 1832 to 1844, when he was appointed superintendent of bridges for the Port Phillip District in Victoria. For nine years he had charge of all roads, bridges, wharves and ferries and acted as advisor to various government departments. In this period he built 53 bridges. Liverpool Weir is the only weir Lennox is known to have designed in the colony. Liverpool Weir was one of the two last convict-built public works at Liverpool, the other being Lennox's Lansdowne Bridge over the Prospect Creek on the Hume Highway, Lansvale. On finishing Lapstone Bridge at Mitchells Pass in the Blue Mountains, Lennox took with him the ironed-gang of at least 60 convict workers to start work on Lansdowne Bridge in 1834. These convicts were stationed around Lansdowne Bridge in a township of convicts and the soldiers who guarded them. They were housed in \\"caravans\\" that were probably like the portable sleeping boxes used by the road gangs. Married soldiers built themselves tiny slab huts, white- washed and roofed with sheets of bark. Another ironed gang of 50 convicts, together with their military guard, were stationed at a quarry opened by Lennox on the Georges River near Voyager Point (east of present-day Holsworthy). The convict workforce quarried and cut stone and punted it up the Georges River to the bridge site. Lansdowne Bridge was completed and opened by Governor Bourke with great fanfare on 26 January 1836, a testament to the skill of Lennox's design and its convict workforce. The bridge remained closed until September 1836, to allow for construction of the stone tollhouse.(Keating, 1996, 63; ADB, Liston, 2009, 18; ) Liverpool Weir, also convict-built, was constructed between February and August 1836. In February some of Lennox's convict gangs from the Lansdowne Bridge encampment moved over to the Liverpool Weir site on George's River, below the Liverpool Hospital.Keating, 1996, 64 Work on Liverpool Weir would have proceeded concurrently with construction of the Landowne Bridge tollhouse. Lennox also used the Voyager's Point quarry for Liverpool Weir with the stone being moved up river on barges. Captain William Harvie Christie of the 80th Regiment, who had been appointed assistant engineer and Superintendent of Ironed Gangs at Liverpool, oversaw the construction of Liverpool Weir. On Christie's departure from Liverpool in 1839 the populace made him a presentation of a piece of silver plate, expressing their gratitude for the \\"great improvements which under your direction have been made in the approaches to this town, in the draining of its streets, but more especially...in the completion of that noble work, the Liverpool Dam\\".ADB, 1969, pp. 393-4; Keating, 1996, 64 Tegg's Almanac of 1842 concurred in this view that Liverpool Weir had boosted the prosperity of the region, noting that it had brought \\"abundance...to the door of thousands [and that] cultivation is intended and much waste or inaccessible land has been stamped with an intrinsic and permanent value\\".(quoted in Keating, 1996, 64) The weir at the existing site was a compromise between Lennox's initial suggestions of a dam of wooden piles and puddled clay a short distance upstream of the hospital, and a larger masonry structure 11 miles downstream including a road crossing, lock and swivel bridge. The weir has a curved downstream face and is one of the first \\"engineered\\" weirs built in the colony. Liverpool Weir effectively divided the salt water from the fresh water of the Georges River, allowing the river to be used for irrigated crop growing. But without pumps or reticulation it would seem, in this period at least, water would have been carted to the town of Liverpool. The town had to wait until 1891 for a piped water supply, but it did provide the first cart access to the Moorebank and Holsworthy areas.Keating, 1996, 64, 90 The weir remained the town's only crossing of the Georges River until the first bridge (a timber truss) was built in 1896 just south of the railway station to connect the town with the rural landholdings. A high level bridge was erected in 1958. A wharf was constructed at the weir and boats up to 140 tons displacement carried timber and farm produce to Sydney via Botany Bay. The top was pitched with freestone blocks. Further detail is provided in a letter from the Colonial Architect in 1857, which described the original construction.AONSW 2/600 dated 21/9/1857 It noted that the principal wall was ashlar 4 feet (1.2m) thick, built in a circular form with joints radiating to the upstream side. Built on a bed of large blocks of stone \\"loosely thrown in\\", 8 feet (2.4m) high in the centre and 11 feet (3.4m) from the bottom of the wall to the base of the river. The 2 feet (0.6m) thick ashlar back wall was constructed 13 feet 6 inches (4.2m) from the centre of the front wall. Three cross walls of unspecified material, but presumably stone, were built to connect the front and back walls at the centre and 20 feet (6.1m) on either side. A statement by Peake(quoted in Laurie, Montgomery & Petit, 1980, 3) was contradicted by the Colonial Architect in 1857 who said that the fill was clay puddle and not ballast and silt. This has been confirmed by later site investigation. The importance of projects such as this in the early colony cannot be underestimated. The provision of water infrastructure was a problem and a focus for government throughout the 19th century. The construction of a weir in Liverpool happened at the same time as major infrastructure projects in Sydney including the construction of Busby's Bore (Sydney's second water supply, after the Tank Stream) and was immediately followed by the construction of Circular Quay. Liverpool Weir also appears to have been one of the first weirs constructed and still surviving in south and western Sydney. While bars and riffles are present, it is thought that the river was navigable upsteam of the weir site before the weir was constructed. Governor Macquarie noted in his journal that Liverpool was \\"admirably calculated for Trade and Navigation ....where the Depth of Water is sufficient to float Vessels of very considerable Burthen\\". It is also likely that Eber Bunker, sea captain and owner of Collingwood upstream of the weir, sailed his ships to Collingwood to unload. The piers of Bunkers Wharf still survived into the living memory of older (former) residents of Liverpool who were alive at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Navigation would have been curtailed by construction of the weir. However, the pond created by the weir would have permitted the passage of local water craft for some distance upstream. The river was the most efficient way of transporting goods to and from Liverpool and inland areas so it is likely that the weir would have been used as a transfer point between land and sea-based transportation. Although a wharf had been constructed adjacent to Liverpool Hospital in 1818, a number of industries were located further upstream closer to the weir (including a grain mill and paper mill). It is also possible that the hospital wharf had fallen into disrepair by the 1830s.Corroneos, 1996, 8 An 1876 photograph of Liverpool Weir shows a substantial pile of rock directly in front of the weir which would have precluded the weir being used for loading and unloading cargo. However, it also shows a derrick crane on the western side, which supports the theory of the downstream end adjacent the left (west) bank being used for cargo handling purposes. Colonial Architect correspondenceAONSW 2/600 notes the need for repairs as early as 1851. Liverpool Weir was damaged by floods in 1852, by which time the masonry was leaking and the paving between the walls was sinking. In September 1855 the Colonial Architect reported to the Colonial Secretary that in his opinion the masonry in the circular, lower face of the dam and the straight wall at the back allows water to percolate through; this softens the puddle between the walls which eventually oozes out at the base of the lower wall thus undermining the paving on the top which consequently sinks. He indicated this was the present state of the dam \\"although it was repaired not more than two or three years ago\\". He also noted that the piles on the upper side of the dam do not appear to have been closely driven, and in his opinion the injury to the dam arises from its not being water tight. By 1857 the right (eastern) bank had been washed away. Following a joint report by the departments of the Colonial Architect and Railway in 1957, repair work was carried out in February 1858. It consisted of filling the whole internal portion with puddle clay on which was laid a 9-inch thick bed of concrete covered with stone flagging 12 inches thick, set in mortar and grouted with Portland cement. About 25 feet of the front wall was rebuilt and a wall added at the right end; a row of close piling was driven into the bank at the right bank end of the front wall; and a rubble stone apron of 7260 (square) feet was laid with 2000 (square) feet being required to complete it. In 1860 another large portion of the eastern (right) bank of the Liverpool Weir was washed away in flooding, cutting a channel around the abutment. As the weir was still being used as the main thoroughfare into Liverpool, it was necessary to extend the weir (and the road on top) across the new channel.Keating, 1996, 82; NSW Govt Arch Office, 1996, 10-11 For the next 100 years the weir appears to have been left largely untouched. Eventually, decades of flooding caused considerable erosion and the weir needed repairing on several occasions, with a major rebuilding in the 1970s and remediation works in 2007‚Äì8. In the later 1970s part of the front wall that had been washed away was replaced and a precast concrete road was built part way across the top of the weir (this was later removed). Further repair works were carried out in the mid 1980s when the scouring on the eastern (right) bank was addressed reinstating the bank using gabion baskets topped with recovered sandstone blocks. In 1985 surface flagging on the eastern side was replaced following washout of the core, with cast in-situ 1m square concrete units. A fishway was constructed in 1997 through the heavily modified and extended eastern section of the weir.NSW Govt Arch Office, Liverpool Weir Remediation, September 2009 Damage again occurred in the right bank area in November 2007. Further major remediation works to re-stabilise and prevent erosion to the main wall were carried out in 2007‚Äì08. While originally built to provide water supply and a river crossing for Liverpool, the weir now plays an important role in stabilising the upstream riverbanks and maintaining the hydraulic regime of the upper part of the Georges River estuary. The reaches of river under the influence of the weir have drastically changed since construction in 1836. The construction of a fishway in 1997 provides native fish passage past the weir and improves the ecology of the Upper Georges River, modified by the weir's construction.(Chipping Norton Lake Authority Annual Report 2008‚Äì09)Sources: Renwick, 2010 pers. comm.; Clarke, 2010 pers. comm.; Chipping Norton, 2009; NSW Govt Arch Office, 2006, 2009; DNR, 2006; Liverpool LEP, 1994; Keating, 1996, Corroneos, 1996; ADB, 1969; AONSW 2/600; Cole, 2000; Laurie, Montgomery & Petit, 1980  Description  Liverpool Weir is located directly east of Liverpool railway station on the Georges River, approximately 40 km upstream of the river mouth. It spans the full width of the Georges River and forms the river's tidal limit. Access to the weir is gained via Lighthorse Park on the western (left) bank and the eastern (right) bank of the watercourse. The eastern access point is reached by heading east of Liverpool city centre on the Newbridge Road. On crossing the George's fiver a slip road (the northernmost section of Heathcote Road) branches off immediately to the left (north) and leads directly to the riverbank. Liverpool Weir was described in 1855 as raising the level of water in the river by 2m, and also providing an access across the Georges River. A nearby former rail bridge was later adapted to provide pedestrian access but was removed in 2007 leaving just the piers. Access across the river is now by the nearby bridge carrying Newbridge Road (2009). The original 1836 Liverpool Weir was constructed with a curved downstream face of large, dressed sandstone blocks founded on shale bedrock at the left bank and loose large stone on the alluvial sands and clays in the central section. The right bank would have consisted of a sand and gravel bar on the inside of the river bend. However, the original footing arrangement is unknown. Reportedly, the right abutment had been flood damaged some time after completion and was repaired with dressed sandstone blocks supported on round piles (photographed during the inspection of 1979). The 1836 upstream wall consisted of a straight sandstone block wall from the centre of the front wall and was likely similarly founded on stone blocks thrown in. Three cross walls connecting the upstream and downstream walls described in the combined Railway and Colonial Architect report of 21 September 1857 were uncovered mostly intact, during the 2008 remediation. These walls contained partly dressed split face blocks that because of their shape and their being inconsistent with the pick finish of the weir blocks, it is likely they were either rejects or leftovers from the recently completed Lansdowne Bridge. The blocks of the internal walls were laid on a 10-20mm lime mortar bed with 5mm shell grit evident. The upstream and downstream masonry walls along with the internal fill provide the mass to resist the water forces and act as a broad beam across the river. The walls and surface flagging protect the internal clay fill from being damaged and eroded. The internal cross walls, while providing only limited structural function would have allowed staged construction in the dry with diversion of the river flows. The puddle clay rammed between the walls provided the impermeable membrane to create a ponded freshwater storage upstream and prevent the ingress of tidal saltwater. Sandstone flagging approx 2 feet by 3 feet by 12 inches thick served as spillway and provided a wet river crossing and protected the all important puddle clay from flows passing over the weir. Early in the weir's life, flows passed through the walls and surface flagging causing piping failure of the puddle clay membrane which resulted in settlement of the protective flagging. Once the flagging was dislodged, flood flows further scoured the puddle clay until the walls were directly exposed and collapsed. Extensions as cantilevered walls using sawn timber piles were designed to cut off the flows. These walls were not able to be driven to bedrock nor were they impermeable to the flood waters of the Georges River. The Colonial Architect, in his 1855 inspection, reported that the means to make the weir impervious to water was to dig out the puddle on both sides of the straight wall and, after pointing or rendering the wall in cement on both sides, to fill in again and well ram the puddle. The term \\"puddle\\" is used to refer to working of clay. Typically, a select clay was mixed with sand and an optimum amount of water added to produce a material that was plastic, dense and impermeable when compacted. Compaction was often achieved by driving sheep or other hoofed animals over the surface but, given the convict workforce and the relatively small compartments, it is likely that placement occurred in layers and compaction was achieved through a combination of \\"treading in\\" by the convicts and by using timber poles to ram the puddle. In the combined report of the state of the weir dated 21 September /1857, Joseph Brady of the Railway Department and James Moore of the Colonial Architect's Department ascertained that in 1851 an addition was made to the Dam on the upper side by driving a double row of timber piles about lengths, from the back (stone upstream) wall ... driven into the silt at the back of the dam but they did not reach the bed of the river. The bedrock in the centre of the river here is 14 metres. A roadway of sleepers was then formed between the back (1836) wall and the row of piles. The piles, each about by , increased the height of the weir and also the water storage. It is unclear from the reports when puddle clay was first placed between the timber piled wall of the roadway extension and the 1836 upstream masonry wall. Both the row of piles and 1836 sandstone back wall were uncovered during the 2008 works including numerous pairs of one metre long wrought iron bars. The bars were anchored into the top of the sandstone wall with lead and with the free end threaded, complete with square nut. It is logical that these bars anchored the 1851 timber sleeper roadway extension to the top of the 1836 upstream wall. The second extension is believed to have occurred about 1860 and consisted of the driving of a row of timber piles each dressed approximately by and capped with a crest of sandstone. This addition can be seen in the 1876 photo and further increased the height of the weir. During the period between 1876 and the inspection of 1979 the majority of the sandstone flagging was replaced with concrete flag units. The sandstone crest was also replaced with an exposed aggregate concrete beam. The 1857 inspection reported the rough stone base had been washed away from the foot of the curved wall causing settlement. A small section of the back wall had also settled with the piling opposite gone to a little extent. The puddle had been washed out from the interior of the old dam for an average depth of 5 feet throughout its whole extent and the flagging had fallen in. The bank at the eastern (right bank) side was washed away to a considerable extent ‚Äì the floods having formed a passage round that end of the weir. The extensive repairs completed in early 1858 included rebuilding 25 feet of the front wall, adding a wall at the right bank end and piling from the end of the wall to the riverbank. A rubble stone apron was laid to protect against scour and undermining of the walls. The whole of the internal portion was filled with puddle clay with a bed of concrete covered with thick flagging set in mortar. From the earliest reports it is evident that scouring had created a deep pool downstream of the weir and had also undercut the downstream right wall. In addition it had removed the right bank, taking out the area where the access road is today. The photo of 1876 clearly shows the scoured right bank and the 1851 roadway addition that reinstated the right bank accessway. The 2008 remediation exposed a row of timber piling retaining each side of the access. The repairs to address flood damage would also have prompted the authorities, as part of the works, to increase the storage of the weir by raising it and to provide dry access across the river. Increasing the height of the structure also increased the water velocity across the weir, resulting in flood damage to the weir surface, riverbank erosion and undercutting of the downstream wall. By the time of the 2008 remediation only the curved wall and flagging toward the left bank remained visible of the 1836 weir. Importantly, the stone internal cross walls and the 1836 upstream straight wall remained as important elements. The puddle clay fill within the weir had been exposed, washed out, and replaced and disturbed by repairs including dwarf concrete cut-off walls. Various services had also been installed over the decades. The report of February 1858 describes repairs executed. These included the whole of the internal portion being filled with puddle clay in which was laid a bed of concrete thick covered with stone flagging thick. At the time the weir was damaged by the November 2007 flood and remediation works were carried out in 2008, the puddle clay was no longer an original element. The sandstone flagging, with the exception of an area at the left bank, had been lost and replaced with concrete flag units with an exposed 70mm aggregate finish, similar in size to the sandstone units. The piping failure of the clay core and the subsequent sinking and washout of the flag units required installation of a free draining layer of railway ballast wrapped in geotextile. A mass-placed concrete blinding layer 150mm thick with a 200mm thick reinforced concrete integral slab, now provides a protective surface to the original and later 19th century structural elements.(Sources: EHC, 2008; Chipping Norton, 2009: DNR, 2006; NSW Govt Arch Office, 2006 & 2009; LEP 1994; AONSW 2/600 NSW; Renwick, 2010; Clarke, 2010: pers. comm) = Condition = The 2007‚Äì08 remediation works revealed that the original masonry upstream wall and three internal cross walls were in good condition. The Chipping Norton Lake Authority engaged the Government Architects Heritage Group to record the repairs, stabilisation and protection works, to provide advice and to review heritage impact. The numerous repairs and extensions of timber piled walls within the structure were also in reasonably good condition. The 1851 timber piled wall roadway extension was generally in reasonable condition but no longer had any evidence of the sleeper roadway other than the wrought iron anchor bars. The upstream timber piled wall of had suffered damage to some areas and was the cause of flow through the structure. This wall is now capped with an exposed aggregate concrete beam. The clay core was suffering a network of piping failure and causing the concrete flag units to settle and dislocate under flood conditions.(DPWS May 1999, Heritage Impact Assessment 2006, DNR 2006, Appendix D) Although the repair works, extensions, additions and construction of the fishway have had an adverse impact on the integrity of the original 1836 weir and have altered its appearance, much of the form of the original weir still exists within the repaired and extended structure. = Modifications and dates = * 1851: First upstream extension constructed of a timber sleeper roadway, 13 feet (approximately 4 metres) wide. A double row of timber piles and a roadway of sleepers were added between the back (upstream) weir wall and the row of piles. * 1855: Colonial Architect notes the piles on the upstream side are not closely driven and previous repairs have failed to address seepage and flagging failure. * 1857: Joint report by the Railway and Colonial Architect Departments identified settlement of walls and flagging and a flood channel scoured through the eastern bank. Specification prepared. * 1858: More substantial repairs carried out including: 25 ft of the front wall rebuilt and a wall added to at the end; additional close piling to the bank; a 9260 sq ft rubble stone apron constructed to protect against scouring and undermining of walls; whole of the internal portion refilled with clay; new stone flagging in a 9in bed of concrete. * : Further 4 metres upstream extension to the weir consisting of a row of timber piles with stone flagging on the crest. Reportedly carried out to address flood damage and the loss of the right bank. * 1876: Additions and repairs undertaken to that date are evident in an 1876 photograph showing the crest to be raised substantially above the previous level. By 1876 the crest of the weir was almost 1.5 metres higher than its original 1836 level. * 1890s: Substantial parts of the sandstone flagged weir surface replaced with exposed aggregate concrete pavers. The upstream sandstone capping beam replaced with exposed aggregate concrete beam. Part of the top course of the curved weir also replaced in a mass concrete in-situ repair with the same exposed aggregate finish. * 1896: Weir no longer used for water supply (superseded by Liverpool Offtake Reservoir) or as a river crossing (Liverpool Truss Bridge). * 1970s: Part of the front (downstream) weir wall washed away and replaced. A concrete road was built part way across the top of the weir (later removed). * 1980s: Major repairs by the Chipping Norton Lake Authority included: removal of the 1970s concrete road; underpinning the curved downstream sandstone wall with concrete and filling of the large scour hole in the right (eastern) bank. The filled area was retained with a wall of rock- filled wire (gabion) baskets to the downstream edge with geotextile and large rock armouring to the surface. The retaining wall was finished with a capping of sandstone blocks retrieved from the riverbed downstream. The riverbed downstream was protected from further scour by the placement of rock-filled wire mattresses. * 1985: Sandstone surface flagging on the eastern bank re- laid with some replaced with concrete units. * 1995: Geotechnical Engineering Group commissioned by the Chipping Norton Lake Authority to carry out an investigation for a proposed 60m long, variably 2-3m deep and several metres wide, fish way at the weir to reinstate native fish passage to the upper reaches of the Georges River. * 1997: Fishway completed, through the heavily modified and extended eastern section of the weir. * 2006: Weir noted to be in poor repair with leakage in the masonry causing water to run through (rather than over) the structure, resulting in wear and collapse. Remediation works were considered necessary to ensure the long term survival of the structure. Heritage Impact Assessment prepared by Government Architect's Office, Department of Commerce, May 2006. The Heritage Office provided comment in 2007, supporting the proposed works. * 2007: Partial collapse of the weir following a storm. * 2007‚Äì08: Chipping Norton Lake Authority implemented emergency repairs to safeguard the weir from further flood damage, permitting remediation work on the fragile structure to protect the weir's heritage fabric. The design allowed management of minor floods, provided temporary access and a platform for large construction plant, and protection from abrasion and vibration. The work included installation of a composite steel and concrete sheet pile wall vibrated 10 metres into the river sediments. The sheetpile wall incorporated stainless steel permanent formwork and special concrete mix capping beam. Protection of the original internal weir elements involved provision of internal drainage layers and an integral reinforced concrete slab surface to replace the trouble-fraught flagging. The old concrete flag units were used as scour protection of the upstream and downstream walls.  Heritage listing  Liverpool Weir is state significant for its historical, historical association and rarity values. It is the only weir in NSW known to have been designed by master mason David Lennox. Before arriving in Australia in 1832, Lennox had occupied responsible positions in Britain for more than twenty years, working on many bridges including Telford's great suspension bridge over the Menai Straits and the stone-arch bridge over the Severn River at Gloucester. Lennox was Australia's first major bridge builder and is a significant figure in NSW's history. He was responsible for many bridges and other civil engineering works in NSW between 1832 and 1844, when he was appointed superintendent of bridges for the Port Phillip District in Victoria. For nine years he had charge of all roads, bridges, wharves and ferries and acted as advisor to various government departments. In this period he built fifty-three bridges. Liverpool Weir was one of the first \\"engineered\\" weirs built in the colony. Built in 1836, it is one of the earliest surviving stone weirs constructed in Australia and one of the few surviving weirs constructed in the early colonial era for the supply of water to a township. Liverpool Weir is an example of the construction of the colony's infrastructure by convict labour, in particular by convicts undergoing secondary punishment. It demonstrates the harsher punishment regime in NSW decreed by the British Government from the mid 1820s to the 1840s in order to revive the fear and dread of transportation. Under this system, re- offending convicts were put to work in gangs on constructing roads, bridges, other public works, timber-getting and lime-burning. Some convicts, including some of those in the Liverpool district, were sentenced to work in irons. Construction of the weir within the flowing and flood-prone Georges River was an achievement. It has survived despite damage from the first floods and others since, which necessitated repairs, stabilisation and extensions. Investigations in 1979 and repair work in 2007‚Äì08 have revealed much about the weir's original construction, the techniques adopted during repairs and extensions in the 1850s and the nature of subsequent extensions and repair works. Short of major intervention work, it is unlikely that further structural research and inspection will reveal more about the weir's construction. Apart from extensions, a concrete road was partly built across the weir in the 1970s which was halted and later removed because of its impact on the weir's stability, and a fishway was built in 1997 through the right abutment. Although the repair works, extensions and additions have had an adverse impact on the integrity of the original structure and have altered its appearance, Liverpool Weir is a rare 19th century water supply structure, and its original and repair fabric have historic and heritage significance. While the weir has long ceased to function as a source for town water and as a George's River crossing, it has gradually developed other functions. It now provides water-based recreational opportunities. It has facilitated re- establishment of the natural migration of fish upstream with construction of the by-pass fishway in 1997. It maintains the (modified) stable condition of the upper Georges River (except for re-admitting fish migration) and it is now a control structure that restricts river bed lowering and bank erosion. Liverpool Weir has local significance for its potential for research into changes in ecology from below to above the weir, during the 170 years of its existence. Liverpool Weir was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 August 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Constructed in 1836 Liverpool Weir has state significance as one of the earliest surviving stone weirs built in Australia and one of the first \\"engineered\\" weirs built in the convict colony. The weir is a rare surviving example of early colonial engineering and demonstrates some of the difficulties overcome in designing water related infrastructure at this time. Relatively few engineering works of this nature survive from the early colonial period of NSW's settlement. Colonial engineering works, particularly those in a setting that can evoke a sense of the colonial landscape (as demonstrated in the downstream view from Liverpool Weir) are relatively uncommon in NSW. Surviving examples provide a tangible link and experience that can not be replicated by photographs or written records.Government Architect's Office, 2006, 17 As a surviving structure built by convict labour, Liverpool Weir has historical significance at state level for its capacity to demonstrate the convict system in NSW in the 1830s. The weir is evidence of the convict-built colonial infrastructure constructed under the harsher system of secondary punishment for repeat offenders that was introduced into the colony from the mid 1820s. Under this system many convict gangs (like the Liverpool Weir convicts) worked in irons. Liverpool Weir has state significance for its long continuity of use. While it ceased use as a fresh water supply and as a river crossing in the 1880s and as a river crossing in the 1890s, it has since gradually developed other functions. It now provides water-based recreational opportunities. It has facilitated re- establishment of the natural migration of fish upstream with construction of the by-pass fishway in 1997. It maintains the (modified) ecology of the upper Georges River (except for re-admitting fish migration), and it is now a control structure that restricts river bed lowering and bank erosion, caused by 20th century sand extraction downstream. The construction of Liverpool Weir is historically significant for its impacts on the traditional way of life of the Darug, Tharawal and Gandangara peoples whose lands bordered the Georges River and whose interactions were governed by free movement up and down the river in bark canoes. The weir created a barrier to this long-standing channel of communication between the Aboriginal peoples of the Georges River. By providing a fresh water supply to the settlers of the area and to the town of Liverpool, as well as access across the Georges River, the weir fostered settlement of the area and consequent Aboriginal dispossession. The weir's construction had environmental impacts on the ecology of the river upstream, creating a tidal barrier between the saline and fresh waters of the Georges River. Liverpool Weir has local significance as the source of the first reliable public water supply for the town of Liverpool, from 1836 until ; as the only crossing of the Georges River at the town until the first bridge was built in 1894 and as the focus of a river port for Liverpool. A wharf was constructed below the weir and ships were loaded to carry timber and farm produce to Sydney via Botany Bay. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Liverpool Weir has state significance for its strong association with its designer, David Lennox; with the convicts under sentence who laboured in ironed gangs to build it, and with Captain William Christie who supervised the convict workforce. Before arriving in Australia in 1832, David Lennox, master mason, had occupied responsible positions in Britain for more than twenty years, working on many bridges including Telford's great suspension bridge over the Menai Straits and the stone-arch bridge over the Severn River at Gloucester. Lennox was appointed by Governor Brisbane as Superintendent of Bridges for the colony of NSW in 1833. Lennox was Australia's first major bridge builder but he also undertook many other civil engineering works in NSW from 1832 to 1844, when he was appointed superintendent of bridges for the Port Phillip District in Victoria. For nine years he had charge of all roads, bridges, wharves and ferries and acted as advisor to various government departments. In this period he built 53 bridges. A number of his works in NSW, namely the Lansdowne Bridge over the Prospect Creek on the Hume Highway at Lansvale; the Lennox Bridge at Parramatta and the Lapstone Bridge at Mitchell's Pass in the Blue Mountains are still standing and are listed on the State Heritage Register. Captain William Harvie Christie of the 80th regiment was assistant engineer and Superintendent of Ironed Gangs at Liverpool whose work in completing Liverpool Weir was particularly noted by the grateful local community and his contemporaries. The convict workforce was likely the same ironed gang who worked first on Lennox's Lapstone Bridge (in the Blue Mountains), then his Lansdowne Bridge over the Prospect Creek at Lansvale on the Hume Highway, before moving on to the Liverpool Weir. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Liverpool Weir is not state significant under this criterion. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Liverpool Weir is not state significant under this criterion. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Liverpool Weir is not state significant under this criterion. Investigations in 1979 and repair work in 2007‚Äì08 revealed much about the weir's original construction and the nature of subsequent extensions and repair works. Short of major intervention work, it is unlikely that further structural research and inspection will reveal more about the weir's construction. Liverpool Weir has local significance for its research potential into changes in ecology from below to above the weir, during 170 years of existence. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Liverpool Weir is state significant as it is the only weir designed by David Lennox, master mason, Superintendent of Bridges for the colony of NSW (1833‚Äì44) and Australia's first major bridge builder. Lennox is known primarily for his bridges. Liverpool Weir is the only surviving example of Lennox's \\"non-bridge\\" work. Liverpool Weir is one of the earliest surviving stone weirs built in Australia, one of the first \\"engineered\\" weirs built in the convict colony on NSW, and one of the few surviving weirs constructed in the colonial era for the supply of water to townships. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Called \\"one of the earliest and most successful women architects of the 20th century\\", her architectural work was largely residential projects in Southern California, but she also did work for the U.S. military and Fuller Theological Seminary. Biography Connor was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1892. She was the daughter of William Connor and Eva Gatch. Her father was a lawyer and \\"prominent citizen and jurist\\" in Des Moines who had served in the American Civil War. He had been born in Ireland and came to the United States as a boy. She had three sisters, Elizabeth, Marjorie, and Dorothy. Connor's father died at age 58 when she was a child. =Education= Connor attended Des Moines public schools until eleventh grade and then continued her education abroad. She studied art & jewelry at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris and attended the Birmingham School of Art in Birmingham, England. Connor then moved back to the U.S. and studied interior decoration at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art. She also attended Cooper Union. Starting in 1923, Connor made her living as a drafter for a series of architects, including T. Beverly Keim in Los Angeles, Allen & Collens in Boston, Soule & Murphy in Santa Barbara, and Reginald D. Johnson, W. L. Risley and Allison & Allison, all in Los Angeles. During this period (from 1925 to 1930) she studied architecture at the Pasadena Atelier of the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design. =Career as an architect= Connor was licensed to practice architecture in California in 1936 and opened her own firm in Pasadena in October of that year. She became a member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1944. Her practice was mainly residential commissions for professional women. From 1946 to 1950 she also designed several small housing projects (from 16 to 74 houses) in Lakewood, Downey, and Anaheim. The Rev. Charles E. Fuller was a major patron of Connor's work. He and his wife Grace commissioned eight separate houses from Connor for their own use or as rental properties at various times. Connor also worked as an associate architect with the firm of Orr, Strange & Inslee on the project to build Fuller Theological Seminary in 1953. Connor suspended her practice from February 1942 to April 1946 due to World War II. During this time she worked for the United States Army Corps of Engineers working on camouflage and \\"other work.\\" Connor often employed the landscape architects Florence Yoch and Lucile Council on her projects. Another architect she worked with was John Byers with whom she designed an adobe house in San Gabriel in 1946. =Women in architecture= At the time Connor began her practice, women architects were rare. Connor was only the sixth woman to be admitted to AIA from California. In 1948 Connor was one of only 10 women architects in California who had their own firms, according to the Los Angeles Times. That same year, Architectural Record documented 1,119 women who had trained as architects but found that only 108 were actually practicing. The two-part article showcased the work of 18 of them, including Connor. Connor was a member of Union Internationale des Femmes Architectes (UIFA) and was elected to the national board of Association for Women in Architecture in 1958. That year Connor researched the records of architects in all the U.S. states and found that at that time, there were only 320 women registered architects; there were seven states which had no women architects registered at all, and women represented about one percent of all the registered architects in the United States in her survey. =Personal life= Connor never married. She was involved in charitable groups outside architecture including the Pasadena chapter of Zonta International and was a charter member of the Women's City Club of Pasadena. In 1964 Connor lost vision in her left eye due to temporal arteritis, and gave up her practice on the advice of her physicians. She moved to Claremont, California that year and became an emeritus member of AIA in 1965. She died on December 29, 1970, in Claremont and was buried in the family plot in Woodland Cemetery in her hometown of Des Moines. The Art, Design & Architecture Museum has a collection of her drawings. The Schlesinger Library has papers related to UIFA donated by Connor.

G. Conn, and the New York Saxophone Quartette Club. His frequent international performances and continued advocacy of the saxophone led to his nickname of \\"Saxophone King.‚Äù  Biography  Edward Lefebre was born in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands to a family of French musicians. While little is known of his early musical career, he primarily performed on the clarinet until meeting Adolphe Sax in Paris in the 1850s. Following his move to Cape Town, South Africa (1859) to run a music store (supplied by his father‚Äôs company), Lefebre began freelance work as a concert saxophonist. These concerts regularly included audiences of South African dignitaries, and featured original repertoire for the saxophone (published by Adolphe Sax). He was then hired as a saxophonist in the Royal Alhambra Palace‚Äôs orchestra in London in 1869. Following a promenade concert at the Royal Opera House with this orchestra, Lefebre was eagerly approached by Charles Gounod who simply said ‚ÄúBravo ‚Äì saxophone!‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt his only impression on famous composers ‚Äì later at a concert in Leipzig, praise from Richard Wagner led to more performances in Germany, though he never wrote for the saxophone. By around 1872, Lefebre had moved to the United States, where he performed clarinet and saxophone as a freelance artist. He later abandoned the clarinet entirely when he joined the Twenty-second Regiment National Guard Band, under direction of Patrick Gilmore, in 1873. This group was one of the first American military bands to include a full saxophone section based on the instrumentation of the Garde R√©publicaine. The busy performance schedule and willingness of Gilmore to program solo works permitted Lefebre ample opportunity to expose audiences to the saxophone, which was still relatively unknown. The full section of Gilmore‚Äôs band provided great opportunity for chamber music, and Lefebre soon formed the New York Quartette Club. Gilmore would also program this quartet on band concerts, and they insisted on performing original repertoire to gain respect for the instrument. Due to the limited repertoire, Lefebre had to commission and compose new works for the saxophone. New York composer Caryl Florio was searching for performers for new works, and wrote a series of pieces for Lefebre including Introduction, Theme and Variation (1879), for saxophone and orchestra, and Allegro de Concert (1885), for saxophone quartet. The New York Quartette Club disbanded following the death of the soprano saxophonist Franz Wallrabe in 1885; however, Lefebre continued performing chamber music and formed the Lyceum Concert Club. This group had unorthodox instrumentation ‚Äì a saxophone soloist, flute soloist, flugelhorn, contrabassoon, and saxophone quartet. Although the personnel and instrumentation changed very frequently and little is known about the group‚Äôs repertoire, the group‚Äôs mission was educational, and always gave lecture recitals. Lefebre became the first saxophonist to make a phonograph recording as a soloist, recording for Edison, or one of its subsidiaries, sometime in early 1889. The nine selections he recorded for the United States Phonograph Company (a subsidiary of Edison's North American Phonograph Company) in 1894 \\"can be deemed with certainty to be the first by a saxophone soloist to be commercially released.\\"Ibid., 28. \\"The repertoire chosen for these recordings represents the breadth of popular nineteenth-century genres recorded by other contemporary wind soloists in the early 1890s. They include two popular songs, a German popular song, three operatic selections, a Strauss lullaby, an Irish song, and a plantation song.\\"Ibid., 1. Upon Gilmore‚Äôs death in 1892, John Phillip Sousa had become the most prominent bandleader in the United States, and Lefebre had joined his band by 1893.For a detailed account of Lefebre's switch from the Gilmore Band to Sousa, see Noyes, James (2001). \\"Lefebre's Last Band: From Gilmore to Sousa (1892-4)\\" The Saxophone Symposium 26: 20-51. At this time he was becoming better known as a pedagogue and was sponsored by C.G. Conn. His experience in manufacturing saxophones in France allowed him to create the Conn ‚ÄúWonder‚Äù saxophone, in which he served as the spokesperson in advertisements. In 1896, Conn had created the Conn Conservatory in Elkhart, Indiana, where Lefebre became an instructor. Due to his heightened fame, Lefebre was able to perform freelance for the remainder of his life as a soloist and with the Lefebre Saxophone Quartette.

From 1960 to 1962, he toured with the U.S. Army as an infantryman during the building of the Berlin Wall, and worked in intelligence collection in East Germany for a year. After a short break in service, he re-enlisted in December 1962, where he schooled in Massachusetts with the former Army Security Agency and made a short tour in Korea. He received a second honorable discharge after being reassigned to Fort Huachuca for two years and there served on the post's rifle team for two years.

His drug investigations resulted in penetrating two major heroin distribution gangs, the arrest and felony convictions of more than 35 hard drug dealers, and the arrest of members of a group called Rights of White People for building single and multiple shot pipe guns. He rose to rank of detective sergeant, then was an auxiliary police officer with the Carolina Beach Police Department for five years. He also taught riot control procedures and was a law enforcement firearms instructor in the Southeastern parts of North Carolina through Cape Fear Technical College, Samson Tech, Wake Tech, Fayetteville, Greensboro, High Point, and as an instructor at the Smith & Wesson Academy in chemical munitions, later years specializing in a police chemical munitions instructor course, then as district sales manager with Smith & Wesson Law Enforcement Division from 1979‚Äì1986, then joining Aircraft Armaments Corporation for four years, again traveling to numerous locations in the US (including Hawaii) and Australia again instructing in law enforcement chemical instructor courses, employed with Applied Laser Systems selling weapons mounted lasers in US and Europe, selling so much product they could not meet the demand, departed after 1 year becoming the US agent for NICO Pyrotechnik selling anti-terrorist munitions, and conducting training sessions and chemical munitions seminars at locations in the US recently retiring after 25 years with NICO Pyrotechnik and Rheinmetall WM as their US agent to the Special Operations community.

The story appears in Fitzgerald's third collection of short stories All the Sad Young Men, published by Scribners in February 1926. The story depicts the troubled relationship of married couple Luella and Charles Hemple, living in New York City in 1925.  Publication  The Adjuster is the sixth story in the collection. All the Sad Young Men was published a year after his third and most celebrated novel, The Great Gatsby, and contains 9 stories: = Contents of All the Sad Young Men = * \\"The Rich Boy\\" * \\"Winter Dreams\\" * \\"The Baby Party\\" * \\"Absolution (short story)\\" * \\"Rags Martin-Jones and the Pr-nce of W-les\\" * \\"The Adjuster (short story) * \\"Hot and Cold Blood\\" * \\"The Sensible Thing\\"\\" * \\"Gretchen's Forty Winks\\"  Background  F. Scott Fitzgerald was born on 24 September 1896 at 418 Laurel Avenue in St Paul, Minnesota. In 1911, when Fitzgerald was 15 years old, his parents sent him to the Newman School, a prestigious Catholic prep school in Hackensack, New Jersey. After graduating from the Newman School in 1913, Fitzgerald decided to stay in New Jersey to attend Princeton University. He joined up for the US Army in May 1917. Upon relocation to Camp Sheridan, near Montgomery, Alabama, he met Zelda Sayre, a daughter of a justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Throughout 1924 their relations became more difficult, their volatility was expressed through increasingly erratic behaviour and by the end of the year Fitzgerald's drinking was developing into alcoholism. However, after a period of extensive revisions, The Great Gatsby was released on 10 April 1925. \\"The reception for the new work was impressive, and it quickly garnered some of Fitzgerald's most enthusiastic reviews but sales did not reach the best-seller levels the author and Scribner had hoped for.\\" As such, Fitzgerald wrote The Adjuster writing at the height of his career but also during a time of disillusionment. He was in financial difficulty, his wife Zelda was sick and he believed her romantically involved with another man., His play, The Vegetable, or From President to Postman had been a failure.  Composition  thumb Fitzgerald named this 1926 collection All the Sad Young Men, included only nine stories, and let them speak for themselves. Reading this harmonious collection one wonders how a writer could have made such progress in so few years. It is no surprise to discover that stories such as \\"The Rich Boy\\" and \\"Winter Dreams\\" were written alongside The Great Gatsby; they share the novel's sorrow for what was once the lifeblood of Fitzgerald's work ‚Äì the felicities of youth. Like Gatsby, the collection shows the heights that Fitzgerald could reach, when money problems, alcoholism and tragedy were at bay. One author states that All the Sad Young Men contained some of his most profound, if not most widely known, short stories, stating that ‚ÄúThe Adjuster looks at the ramifications of a woman's decision to marry for money and what happens when her husband and child fall ill and she has to assume responsibility she never imagined‚Äù and that ‚ÄúAll the Sad Young Men stands out as a bridge between Gatsby and Tender Is the Night‚Äù widely considered to be his best works, revealing a deepening of his talent in the interim between these two American classics. A major profile of Fitzgerald ran on 17 April 1926, under a title that already felt inevitable, ‚ÄúThat Sad Young Man.‚Äù John Chapin Mosher wrote of Fitzgerald's drinking and driving, his fabulous and yet-unmatched early success, and, happily, his dedication as a writer. ‚ÄúThe popular picture of a blond boy scribbling off best sellers in odd moments between parties is nonsense. He's a very grave, hardworking man, and shows it. In fact there is the touch of the melancholy often obvious upon him.‚Äù  Reception  Many of the stories praised in Fitzgerald's lifetime for their artistic brilliance have shown to be more carefully conceived and artfully crafted than they had been thought by Fitzgerald's contemporaries to be. Alice Petry highlights layers of complexity in \\"The Adjuster\\", which she describes as well known, but less often examined. Reviewers of All The Sad Young Men saw the same evidence of artistic maturity. \\"Fitzgerald has acquired maturity, a happy profundity,\\" announced the Milwaukee Journal, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer likewise recognised \\"a ripened art, a wistful humour, a legitimate irony that comes from a development of understanding and wisdom.\\" Fitzgerald gained renewed popularity in the 1950s and 60s. Scott and Zelda became romantic figures, embodying the spirit of the Roaring Twenties along with other significant figures of the \\"Jazz Age\\" such as Ernest Hemingway. Both Hemingway and Fitzgerald Another theme commonly found in the works of these authors was the death of the American dream, which is exhibited throughout many of their novels. Although The Great Gatsby received a poor reception in the author's lifetime, it is now considered to be one of the greatest novels in American history. Of All the Sad Young Men, The New York Times wrote, \\"The publication of this volume of short stories might easily have been an anti- climax after the perfection and success of 'The Great Gatsby' of last Spring. A novel so widely praised ‚Äî by people whose recognition counts ‚Äî is stiff competition. It is even something of a problem for a reviewer to find new and different words to properly grace the occasion. It must be said that the collection as a whole is not sustained to the high excellence of 'The Great Gatsby,' but it has stories of fine insight and finished craft.\\" Under the headline ‚ÄúStories by Scott Fitzgerald, Some Good, Others Please Remit,‚Äù the reviewer of All The Sad Young Men on 13 March 1926 approved of ‚ÄúThe Rich Boy,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Adjuster‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWinter Dreams.‚Äù On 20 March 1926, All The Sad Young Men was the sole recommendation under ‚ÄúShort Stories‚Äù in the ‚ÄúTell Me a Book to Read‚Äù column, but with only partial praise: ‚ÄúTwo, perhaps three samples of the Fitzgerald who wrote ‚ÄòGatsby,‚Äô one well-done experiment in the psycho-sexual, ‚Äòslice‚Äô genre, and some quid-pro-quoes for checks from magazines.‚Äù  Analysis  In the introduction to I'd Die For You and Other Stories first published in 2017, Anne Margaret Daniel states that \\"Fitzgerald always considered himself a novelist, though he was a superb writer of short fiction. His short stories, loved and well known, stand alone, but they were often a testing ground for him, a place for rough drafts, an initial space for ideas and descriptions, characters and places, elements of which would find their way into his following novels.\\" Fitzgerald was from the beginning of his career interested in psychological phenomena and their explanation. According to Ronald Berman, \\"Fitzgerald's protagonists are judged by contemporary psychological standards‚Ä¶ If we look at Fitzgerald's protagonists in the 1920s, it is fairly plain that they are intensely self-conscious. They try to explain themselves to themselves - and also, without much success, to others. They try to remake themselves.\\" Luella Hample, as the protagonist of The Adjuster embodies Fitzgerald's exploration of psychoanalytical and behavioural tendencies. \\"She paused, brooding. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry for him I don‚Äôt know what to do, Ede‚Äîbut if we sat home, I‚Äôd just be sorry for myself. And to tell you another true thing, I‚Äôd rather that he‚Äôd be unhappy than me...Luella was not so much stating a case as thinking aloud. She considered that she was being very fair.\\" Stories from this collection including The Rich Boy, The Adjuster, and Absolution explore themes of the decadent lifestyle of the \\"Roaring 20s\\" but also the anxieties and difficulties of relationships and post-war depression. The Adjuster portrays themes of disenchantment, responsibility, fulfilment within relationships and marriage and is analogous of Fitzgerald's relationship to his wife Zelda Fitzgerald. The Australian states that ‚Äúthe stories here are about divorce and despair, working days and lonesome nights, smart teenagers unable to attend college or find a job, the wild vitality and grinding poverty of New York City.‚Äù  See also  * F.

The losses flowing from the Villanova game were exacerbated by a $10,000 guarantee paid to the visiting team. The December 3 game was the last in Saint Mary's football until 1970. On January 4, 1951, one month after the close of the season, Saint Mary's announced that it was abandoning its intercollegiate football and baseball programs for the duration of the national emergency resulting from the Korean War.The Korean War began in June 1950. The Chinese entered the war in October 1950 and heavy fighting between American and Chinese forces ensued through the last three months of the year. In addition to the war, the school cited \\"the growing difficulty of sustaining academic standards in the face of an inflated competition, especially in football.\\" The school also expressed its \\"profound gratitude to the legions of loyal adherents . . . who have supported the athletic program over the many years that St. Mary's college teams figured prominently in the National sports world.\\" Two rival programs among the west coast Catholic colleges, Loyola of Los Angeles and San Francisco, terminated their football programs one year later.

It was designed by Francis Greenway, Edmund Blacket and Walter Liberty Vernon and was built from 1822 to 1958, originally with the use of convict labour. Variously known as the Colonial Medical Service Hospital, Benevolent Asylum, Government Asylum and Liverpool State Hospital and Asylum, it is now the Liverpool campus of TAFE NSW. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 11 December 2009.  History  =Aboriginal occupation of the Liverpool region= The building in the Liverpool State Hospital era Some 40,000 years before the colonisation of Liverpool, this land was occupied by the Darug people and the neighbouring Tharawal and Gandangara tribes. The land was known as Gunyungalung and the Georges River was the natural boundary between the Darug, or \\"woods\\" tribe, and the \\"coast\\" tribes of Tharawal and Gandangara. Although there was a long and established occupation of the site prior to colonisation, there are no known Aboriginal sites within the former Liverpool Hospital complex.Keating, 1996; www.liverpool.nsw.gov.au/aboriginalpeople.htm; Tuck & Douglas, 2002 =European colonisation and the establishment of the first Liverpool Hospital= In 1810, following the lead of the prominent pioneer Thomas Moore, Governor Lachlan Macquarie set out on a surveying expedition along the newly discovered Georges River. On the undulating Cumberland Plain and the banks of the Georges River, Governor Macquarie located the new township of Liverpool. The construction of a hospital, to accommodate and service the health requirements of a predominantly convict population, was an early development in Liverpool and one granted a picturesque location on the banks of the Georges River. Macquarie chose this position because he envisioned the hospital building to be striking when viewed from either the river itself or from the township. Macquarie's original use of this location was as the site of the first Liverpool hospital, built in 1810. This first hospital was a small brick, three-room construction built to accommodate up to 30 patients. For a growing population such as Liverpool's, this first hospital quickly became overcrowded and under-equipped to service the township. Although coming to the end of his time as governor, Macquarie undertook one of his grandest projects in the construction of the second (and surviving) Liverpool Hospital. This project was to become part of Macquarie's lasting legacy and it was the last major design involving Francis Greenway, Macquarie's appointed Civil Architect. =Construction of Liverpool Hospital (Block B)= In 1820, Macquarie called upon Greenway to draw up the early designs for the new Liverpool Hospital. Following Macquarie's return to England in 1822 and the downgrading of significant colonial investment in public works, the designs for the Liverpool Hospital were reassessed and altered by Greenway to suit the needs of the incoming governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane. To the north of the first 1810 hospital, construction of the new facility commenced in 1822 but, following the laying of the foundations and a quarrel over the prepared estimates and bills, Greenway was dismissed by Governor Brisbane and a new government architect, Standish Lawrence Harris, was appointed. Harris inspected the foundations already in place and concluded that, due to poor materials and workmanship, the footings should be removed and relaid. By the end of 1822, these foundations had been replaced and construction of the walls was underway. With Greenway's departure in 1822 and the growing attention being paid to the extended public budget, progress on the hospital construction slowed. Although attributed to Greenway, there is conflicting evidence as to whose design the current construction actually reflects. Since leaving the project in 1822, and the official starting date of construction in 1824, there is a significant chance that Greenway's plans were reviewed and altered according to the direction of the governor of the time. The earliest surviving plans of the hospital construction, \\"Plans and Elevation of the General Hospital Liverpool\\", date from 1825/26. Being unsigned, there is no tangible evidence to indicate whether the original Greenway designs survived intact or in an altered form. With Brisbane's time as governor of the colony coming to an end in 1825, and the arrival of Governor Ralph Darling, the construction of the hospital was, once again, continued under the direction of a new governor. Although the walls of the hospital were complete and the roof construction was underway, it is possible that the plans may well have undergone changes after 1825. By December 1829, the construction of the Liverpool Hospital was finally complete. After seven years of construction, and multiple suspected changes to its original design, the final building was a distinct departure from the simple box-like structures of many public buildings in the colony. This creative design, although possibly altered, is attributed to Greenway's design skills and the influence of the former Governor Macquarie on the creation of the civic environment in the colony. Despite construction commencing in 1822 (though officially in 1824) and finishing in 1829, the main building of the former Liverpool Hospital complex has a distinctive \\"1825\\" embossed sandstone plaque above the entrance. As this date does not correlate with either the commencement or conclusion of the construction work, it is undetermined what the 1825 date actually relates to. Perhaps it is the date of the earliest surviving plans, but this reference remains unsubstantiated. While the construction of the main hospital building was underway, the convict labourers also undertook the construction of the brick wall that surrounds the complex, that has survived largely intact. By 1829, convict bricklayers and stonemasons had built a 10-foot high wall, with stone entrance pillars, that was to remain, almost in its entirety, as a historical boundary for the site. This wall has limited the physical expansion of the site throughout its history and ensured that, while the site did not expand, the buildings and the land had a continual history of adaption, modification and reuse. Cserhalmi, CMP Vol 1 & 4, 1994; Liverpool Heritage Study Vol 1, 1992; Tuck & Douglas, 2002; Keating, 1996 =Colonial Medical Service Hospital (1830-51)= Following the completion of the construction of the main building in 1829 (there were some outbuildings to be completed in the following years), the Liverpool Hospital was officially opened with the Colonial Medical Service tenanting the new building. With Liverpool being the new centre for the dispatch of convict labour gangs in the colony, the objective of the health service was to care for the significant convict population in the area. Control of the new hospital was undertaken by James Bowman, the Principal Surgeon and head of the Service. The facility was available to convicts labouring for the government free of charge. A fee, of between one and three shillings, was charged for free settlers and to convicts assigned to private colonists. The large convict population of Liverpool's early years fell away with the cessation of transportation to NSW from 1840 and the population of the promising new township started to decline. Without the population numbers needed to support the hospital, and with the inmates' accommodation and facilities becoming increasingly unhygienic and inadequate, the hospital soon lost its purpose and was vacated by the Colonial Medical Service in 1845.Cserhalmi, CMP Vol 1, 1994; Liverpool Heritage Study Vol 1, 1992; Tuck & Douglas, 2002; Kelly, 2007 =Benevolent Society (1851-62)= The hospital site lay vacant for a short time but in 1850 both the Roman Catholic Church and the Benevolent Society were vying for the use of the site. The Benevolent Society, a government-supported organisation that Governor Macquarie had established in 1820, was a facility to care for the sick, destitute and aging population in Sydney and, with the original Sydney Asylum (near present-day Central railway station) becoming increasingly overcrowded, the Society needed to acquire a new branch and expand quickly. The Society assessed the Liverpool site and, following approval for their use, opened this branch of the Benevolent Society in 1851, with the transfer of 240 male inmates. To reuse the site, additional buildings and alterations were required and the Government Architect, Edmund Blacket was called upon to make the necessary alterations and preparations to convert the hospital site to an asylum at a cost of 525 pounds. For his efforts, Blacket was made an Honorary Life Member of the Society. Despite the changes, the site was never adequate for the needs of the Benevolent Society, and it was becoming overcrowded even in 1852. Using the labour of the asylum inmates, further changes were made to accommodate additional beds but, by 1862, the Government had grown dissatisfied with the work of the Benevolent Society and it took over control and the future running of the facility.Cserhalmi, CMP Vol 1, 1994; Tuck & Douglas, 2002; Kelly, 2007; DPWS Heritage Design Services, 2002; Keating, 1996 =Government Asylum (1862-1918)= The Government's takeover of the asylum signalled a major change in policy for health care in the colony. Approximately 403 patients were residing at the asylum at this time and the government appointed a Superintendent, Thomas Burnside, a retired army sergeant, to take over the day-to-day running of the facility. His wife, Mary Burnside, was appointed as the Matron to continue with the care of the patients in residence, alongside her husband. Following Thomas' death in 1869, William Strong was appointed as Medical Superintendent, from 1871 to 1886. He and Mary Burnside formed a remarkable professional team that, by the late 1870s, had cared for no fewer than 700 destitute, aged and infirm patients. In 1886, Strong was replaced by Joseph Aloysius Beattie, a hard but fair superintendent who remained at the Liverpool Asylum until his retirement in 1916.Beattie retired after a stroke. He died in 1920 To compensate for the low salary for the professional medical superintendents at the asylum, Beattie was entitled to run a private practice from the site, even though this took him away from his work for long periods each day. Following his retirement, Beattie's private practice was taken on by his successors Dr MacDonald and Dr J. Pirie. The Government Asylum period was one of great change to the site. With the rate of admissions growing steadily, the main hospital building was in need of extension and more permanent additions to accommodate the increasing numbers of inmates requiring care. The surviving wings flanking the main building (Blocks A & C) were designed by Edmund Blacket and constructed in 1866 and 1874, respectively. In an effort to be architecturally sympathetic to the design of the main hospital building, Blacket constructed these two- storey brick and slate wings to complement, without detracting from, the dominant physical presence of the 1820s hospital building (Block B). As well as these adjoining wings, the former Liverpool Hospital complex has seen a long sequence of construction over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, reflecting the changing needs of the site as a health facility. Many of these additions, alterations and constructions occurred while the Government was in control of the asylum because the once-model establishment was slowly disintegrating and was in dire need of repairs and new facilities. Block F was designed and constructed by Government Architect WL Vernon, -07, to replace the former kitchen and laundry buildings that dated from the early nineteenth century. The kitchen had always been in a separate building, away from the hospital because of an existing fear of fire, but by the early twentieth century, it was decided to enclose the various structures and combine a number of small buildings into the single complex. Block F is also dominated by a tall brick chimneystack. Although the stack is believed to have been rebuilt (s), the base appears to be original, dating from .Cserhalmi, CMP Vol 1 & 4, 1994; Tuck & Douglas, 2002; Kelly, 2007; DPWS Heritage Design Services, 2002 The forecourt space to the main hospital building (Block B) is distinguished by landmark plantings of a number of mature, significant trees including a hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii); Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and a Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla). These may date from 1850s but at least date from the Government Asylum era. Bunya pines were only \\"discovered\\" by Europeans in 1848 and brought from Queensland to NSW soon after, being rapidly planted in key private and public gardens since - notably Government buildings such as court houses, schools, hospitals. Hoop pines have been used from earlier, 1820s onward and Norfolk Island pines from earlier still. These araucaria trees featured in a 1920s drawing of the hospital made by architect and artist William Hardy Wilson in his book \\"Old Colonial Buildings of NSW and Tasmania\\". Block C has a mature native cypress/Port Jackson pine (Callitris rhomboidea) and a number of mature tree ferns (Alsophila sp. or Cyathea sp.) close to or against the building. =Liverpool State Hospital and Asylum (1918-58)= To accommodate the State hospital functions, this period of the former Liverpool Hospital complex saw major alterations and further additions to the site. The site had become one of the major hospitals in the Sydney metropolitan area and, by the early twentieth century, the government had every intention of extending the Liverpool Asylum to accommodate its additional hospital functions. Even though early negotiations had already progressed, the outbreak of the First World War saw the sale of the adjoining land fail to eventuate and, with the convict-built brick wall surrounding the complex, there was little opportunity to undertake further constructions to expand the facility. The remaining option for the Government, in order to continue its use of the hospital complex, was to redevelop and modify the existing buildings within the boundary walls. The intention was to bring the hospital complex up to current twentieth century standards. With new facilities provided to serve and care for the wider community, the Liverpool Hospital became one of the main state hospitals during this time. However, by 1958, the existing buildings had become increasingly inadequate for the needs of the hospital and, being unable to easily adapt the built fabric to modern medical practices, the hospital was forced to move to a neighbouring location. This closure of the hospital, after almost 150 years, and its transfer to new facilities on an adjoining site, ended a long-standing and continuous history of servicing the health needs of the Liverpool community at this site. The 1960s saw the beginning of a new use for the site, as a tertiary education facility.Cserhalmi, CMP Vol 1 & 4, 1994; Thorp, 1993; Kelly, 2007 =Liverpool Technical College (1960-present)= Following the closure of the hospital complex as a medical facility, the site and its existing buildings were acquired in June 1960 and converted for use as a Technical College. By July 1961, the conversion was complete and the College was opened. The College initiated a building conversion program that saw the demolition of some twentieth century additions to the site and the construction of a number of new buildings (Blocks J & K). Later, the College became the South Western Sydney Institute of TAFE.Cserhalmi, CMP Vol 1, 1994; Tuck & Douglas, 2002; Kelly, 2007; Liverpool Heritage Study Vol 1, 1992; Cserhalmi, 2006 =Comparisons with other NSW convict and colonial hospitals= The survival of the former Liverpool Hospital is rare in terms of early hospitals in NSW. The earliest hospital in Sydney, established in 1788, was a portable tent hospital at George Street, The Rocks. In 1810, Governor Macquarie started construction on the Sydney (Rum) Hospital, completed in 1816. This was the first permanent hospital in the colony but only the northern wing (now Parliament House) and the southern wing (now The Mint) have survived. The central wing was demolished and rebuilt in the late nineteenth century as the present Sydney Hospital. The Parramatta Hospital was the oldest continually occupied site for public health in Australia (for 200 years) but this site has undergone various changes over its history. The original 1789 hospital was replaced by two convict-era hospitals (1792 & 1818) that were then replaced by the 1896-1901 building that was severely modified over the twentieth century. Demolished in 2004, the site has been redeveloped as the Parramatta Justice Precinct with the in situ conservation of the Parramatta Hospital Archaeological Site, including most significant archaeology of the convict and colonial hospital buildings (1792-1901). As one of the oldest existing hospital complexes in Australia, there are few sites with comparable built fabric and archaeology, which equate to that of the former Liverpool Hospital.  Description  =Site and building complex (1820s)= The former Liverpool Hospital site is bounded by a brick wall that was built by convict bricklayers and stonemasons in the late 1820s. This wall remains largely intact and has acted as a hindrance to the expansion of the site throughout its history, therefore prompting the reuse and modifications of the site and its buildings over the years. This physical hindrance to any further expansion of the site has also seen the retention of the hierarchical layout of the complex, with any development (bar Blocks J and K) being respectful to the dominating presence of the main Block B hospital building. A small section of the brick wall was demolished and rebuilt in the mid-nineteenth century, but the majority of the brick and stonework, lime mortar joinery and metal fence and gates are original (a section of the wall at the rear of the site, backing onto the railway line, has been permanently removed). =Gate Keepers Cottages (1820s)= The fence and the entrance to the former hospital complex, is also flanked by two small rendered brick and slate Gate-Keepers Cottages (Blocks S and T). Positioned at the entrance of the site in front of the main hospital building, these cottages, built at the same time as Block B in the 1820s, have been internally renovated but retain their original external construction and joinery. =Main Building Forecourt and plantings= The forecourt space to the main hospital building (Block B) is distinguished by landmark plantings of a number of mature, significant coniferous trees including a hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii); Bunya pine (A.bidwillii) and a Norfolk Island pine (A.heterophylla). These may date from 1850s but at least date from the Government Asylum era. Bunya pines were only \\"discovered\\" by Europeans in 1848 and brought from Queensland to NSW soon after, being rapidly planted in key private and public gardens since - notably Government buildings such as court houses, schools, hospitals under the promotion of Directors of the Botanic Gardens Charles Moore and Joseph Maiden. Hoop pines have been used from earlier, 1820s onward and Norfolk Island pines from earlier still. These araucaria trees featured in a 1920s drawing of the hospital made by noted architect and artist William Hardy Wilson in his book \\"Old Colonial Buildings of NSW and Tasmania\\". Block C has a mature native cypress/Port Jackson pine (Callitris rhomboidea) and a number of mature tree ferns (Alsophila sp. or Cyathea sp.) close to or against the building. =Main Building (1820s Hospital)= The main 1820s hospital building (Block B), built by convict labour in the Colonial Georgian architectural style, is an ambitious yet simple brick construction with sandstone foundations and slate roof. Designed in a single-bay width to allow cross ventilation, the surviving building reflects its intended use and the development of hospital design in the colony. The final design of the building, topped with a substantially intact octagonal tower, demonstrates the high standard of convict building techniques and workmanship in the colony, their work still distinguishable by the broad arrow \\"frog\\" imprinted on the convict-made bricks. The architectural design of this fine building was also a distinct departure from the simple box design of public buildings, which is a reflection of the creativity of both Governor Macquarie and, possibly also, his appointed Civil Architect Francis Greenway, who has been attributed with the design. =Block B= With intact and fine brickwork and red rubbed curved arches, Block B retains much of its stylistic detailing today. However, the building has undergone a number of internal modifications throughout its history. The entrance of this building is marked with a double panelled front door with an elegant semi-circular fanlight above and sidelights at each side. Above this entrance-way is an embossed sandstone plaque marked \\"GR 1825\\" with an image of a crown. This marker may have been installed at this time but it refers to neither the date construction was started nor the year it was completed. Being the main building of the complex, Block B also contains a 28-metre (92-foot) central circular tower that is topped with an octagonal lantern and arched windows. Internally, this landmark tower retains much of its original cedar joinery and stone staircase. =Blocks A & C - 1866-74 Blacket wings= Flanking Block B, Blocks A and C are two Edmund Blacket-designed brick and slate wings that were a later addition to the main 1820s hospital building. Although built some 40 years later, in 1866 and 1874, these wings were sympathetically designed to complement the original building in both design and materials. These wings have intact and significant brickwork, tuck pointing, joinery and stairwells. =Block F (1902-7)= Constructed between 1902 and 1907, Block F is a conglomeration of kitchen and laundry blocks, along with some smaller buildings, that was designed by WL Vernon with asymmetrical planning and a complex roofline. Having combined an assortment of smaller-use buildings, Block F is now a brick complex with a number of entrances but no internal circulation. Block F is also dominated by a large brick chimneystack that is a physical representation of the early twentieth century hospital design and reflects the use of fossil fuels as an energy source during the early use of the site. The base of this stack appears to be original () but it is believed that the chimney has been rebuilt, possibly around the 1940s. =Block G (s)= Block G, originally a store building, is a single-storey s brick building with verandahs on three sides. Although there have been internal alterations, the external structure, internal joinery and a long roof lantern are original. =Block E (mid 19th c.)= Block E, on the south-east part of the site, is a mid-nineteenth century single-storey brick and steel construction originally built as a dining hall. This building has undergone a number of additions and changes over the years. =20th c. Blocks J & K= The harmonised architectural character of the site complex has been interrupted with the more recent, mid-twentieth century constructions of Blocks J and K. The single-storey Block J and the three-storey Block K are both brick buildings that do not integrate into the existing architectural context of the site and, as such, have low significance. Block K, in particular, has a negative physical impact on the site because of its immense scale, somewhat diminishing the scale of the main Block B building. = Modifications and dates = * 1830s - Block B was converted for use by the Benevolent Society as an asylum * - Kitchen block was added (site of Block F today) * 1852-61 - Additional buildings constructed by Benevolent Society, including Block E and a slab hut built alongside kitchen block (demolished ) * 1862 - Government carried out repairs to existing buildings and initiated the construction of Blocks A and C (completed 1866 and 1874) * 1860s-70s - Covered walkway between Block B and kitchen rebuilt * Portion of brick wall (northern section) rebuilt * s - Block G constructed * - Balconies on Blocks A and C were complete * 1902-07 - Block F (with chimneystack) constructed to combine kitchen, laundry and other small buildings * 1918-58 - Major alterations and further additions to the site to accommodate State hospital functions * s - Construction of Block H; Chimneystack (Block F) possibly replaced * s - Construction of Block J * 1962-88 - College carried out alterations and additions to the site to adapt to its use asan educational facility * 1970s - Construction of Block K * 1975/6 - National Estate Program grant of $10,000 for extensive work to preserve the fabric of the main building (part of much larger funding c$300,000 for total works).

The former hospital is also State significant for its long-standing, continuous history of servicing the health needs of, first the convicts and then of the wider Liverpool community from 1810 to 1958. Built by convict labour, the main 1820s Colonial Georgian building (Block B), its design initiated by Governor Macquarie and attributed to Francis Greenway, is considered one of the finest colonial buildings remaining in Australia, demonstrating the high standard of workmanship carried out by the convict labour gangs. Convict labour was also used to construct the Gate-Keepers Cottages (Blocks S & T), s, and the brick wall that continues, in the most part, to encircle the complex. The surviving complex of buildings associated with the hospital period (Blocks A, B, C, S, T, F & G), are a fine representation of the high standard of architectural design and construction in the colony. Flanking the main hospital building, the Edmund Blacket-designed Blocks A and C complement the original 1820s building while the Walter Liberty Vernon-designed Block F was a sympathetic addition to the complex, . Liverpool Hospital is State significant for its associations with Governors Lachlan Macquarie (1810‚Äì21), Sir Thomas Brisbane (1821‚Äì25) and Sir Ralph Darling (1825‚Äì31), the Civil Architect, Francis Greenway (1816‚Äì22) and the Colonial/Government Architects, Edmund Blacket (1849‚Äì54) and Walter Liberty Vernon (1890-1911). In situ archaeology of the original 1810 convict-built Macquarie hospital has State significance for its potential to demonstrate the development of hospital facilities from the earliest years of settlement, as well as the techniques and materials used by the convict labour gangs. The presence of pre-1850 archaeology is rare in NSW. There are few sites around Australia comparable to the former Liverpool Hospital complex which has State significance for its historic, associative, aesthetic, social, research, rarity and representative values. Liverpool Hospital was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 11 December 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The former Liverpool Hospital complex is of State significance as one of the oldest, finest and largely intact colonial hospital complexes in Australia. The surviving buildings from the hospital period (Blocks A, B, C, S, T, F & G) are highly significant in demonstrating the fine craftsmanship of the convict labour gangs of the colony as well as the development and conditions of hospitals and asylums in NSW over a 150-year period. The ongoing development and continuity of this site, from the earliest years of the nineteenth century colonial period up to the mid-twentieth century, is also significant in the history of this site as an early colonial convict hospital that evolved to service the needs of the wider Liverpool community. Having been enclosed within a convict-built brick wall since the 1820s, the historic use and expansion of the site has been restricted throughout the site's history. Excluding the more recent constructions from the s (Blocks J & K), any additions or constructions were carried out to complement the existing hierarchical layout and context of the site. The main 1820s hospital building (Block B) had always exerted a dominating physical presence and, any addition to the site was constructed to complement and not detract from the hierarchy among the existing built fabric of the site. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The former Liverpool Hospital complex is of State significance for its association with the governors Lachlan Macquarie, Sir Thomas Brisbane and Sir Ralph Darling, who were all instrumental in its construction. Civil Architect Francis Greenway and Colonial/Government Architects Standish Harris, Edmund Blacket and W. L. Vernon were responsible for the design of various components of the site over its development as a hospital/asylum facility and, although the original design has been attributed to Greenway, being the last major building he designed for Governor Macquarie, it is unknown if the completed building was constructed entirely to his design. The former hospital complex also has associations with the medical practitioners, James Bowman, Joseph Beatty and Thomas and Mary Burnside. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The former Liverpool Hospital complex is of State significance for the aesthetic inherent in its surviving built fabric. The earliest surviving and main 1820s hospital building (Block B) has remained, throughout the hospital's existence, the consistent centre of the site's layout. This ambitious, yet simple, Colonial Georgian building is topped with a significant 28 metre (92-foot) tower with an octagonal lantern and arched windows. With its adjoining Edmund Blacket-designed wings (Blocks A & C) and the smaller WL Vernon-designed buildings on the site, most designed to be sympathetic and complementary to the architectural harmony of the site through the use of matching materials and proportions, the complex is able to reflect the aesthetically attractive ambitions of the early colony. The design of Block B was a distinct departure from the typical box-like shape of public buildings, thus reflecting the creative design influence of Macquarie on the creation of the civic environment and, possibly, the government architect Francis Greenway, who has been attributed with the design. The quality and craftsmanship of the convict labour gangs is also reflected in the construction (their work still distinguishable by the broad arrow \\"frog\\" imprinted on the convict-made bricks). The site also has State significance as a noted and iconic landmark in Liverpool and it is a site that is held in high esteem by the wider community and the architectural heritage industry. Many heritage professionals regard the site, particularly the main 1820s building (Block B), as one of the finest colonial buildings remaining in Australia. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former Liverpool Hospital complex is of State significance as a site with a long and continuous history of servicing the health needs of the community over 150 years (from the earliest years of the penal settlement) and, since 1961, as an educational facility. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The former Liverpool Hospital complex is of State significance as one of the few known sites in Liverpool with pre-1850 archaeology. It is especially significant for the known archaeological remains of the 1810 hospital. A portion of the archaeology of the 1810 hospital has been recovered to date and the high possibility of uncovering further remains makes the former Liverpool Hospital site an important resource for early convict-era archaeology, of which there are very few, if any, examples, with comparable research value in Australia. On this site, the research potential to reveal evidence of the development of Liverpool and the construction and use of an early colonial hospital building is significant. This archaeology has potential to reveal an understanding of convict construction techniques and materials. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The former Liverpool Hospital complex is of State significance for its rarity as an early colonial public building that has had a long and continuous use, firstly as a health facility, initially for convicts and, later, for the wider Liverpool community (1810-1958). The survival of the former Liverpool Hospital is rare in terms of early hospitals in NSW. With a long sequence of construction dating from 1810, the existence of pre-1850 archaeology on the site is extremely rare. Being one of the oldest remaining hospital complexes in Australia, there are few sites with comparable built fabric and archaeology, that equate to that of the former Liverpool Hospital. (See History - Comparisons with other NSW convict and colonial hospitals). The main 1820s hospital building (Block B) is also rare in design as a distinct departure from the simple box-like construction of public buildings in the colony. This reflects on the influence of Governor Macquarie over the civic environment and, possibly also, the creativity of the government architect, Francis Greenway, who has been attributed with the design. The former Liverpool Hospital site is enclosed within a convict-built brick wall, constructed alongside the main 1820s building. Although a small portion of this wall has been demolished and replaced (), the wall is rare as a surviving example of the quality of craftsmanship of the convict labour gangs. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The former Liverpool Hospital complex is of State significance as a representative, and largely intact, early public building from Governor Macquarie's ambitious public works program to develop Liverpool and the colony. The complex represents the design and character of early colonial hospital buildings in Australia and the technologies that were developing in the early colonial towns. The early hospital buildings reflect the high standard of architectural design and construction in the colonial period while the later buildings, resulting from the continuous construction program from the early nineteenth century, reflect the various approaches to hospital design philosophy, as well as the impact of the successive colonial and government architects on hospital design.

During the dissolution of the Soviet Union, political tensions in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic led to Transnistria declaring independence from Moldova, culminating in the Transnistrian War of 1992. As part of the ceasefire agreement ending the war, a Joint Control Commission composed of Moldovan, Transnistrian, and Russian forces was established to supervise the demilitarized zone which was located in the Transnistrian region. The Joint Control Commission still supervises the zone, and negotiations to resolve the dispute are ongoing. The negotiations are supported by the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the United States, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). History = 1924-1990 = Romanian territory until 1940; orange is present-day Transnistria; yellow is Transnistria during WWII; the red line is Moldova after the Cold War (1991), and the orange line is the Moldovian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The proclamation of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924 established Transnistria's status as an autonomous polity. In 1941, Romanian forces allied with Germany in the Second World War attacked the USSR and captured Transnistria. The USSR reconquered Moldova in 1944, and Transnistria became part of the newly-created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1990, the eastern part of the MSSR declared its independence within the USSR as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (PMR). Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev signed a decree which voided decisions made by the People's Deputies of Transnistria. = 1991-present =  Transnistria War  After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, underlying tensions between Transnistria and Moldova culminated in the March ‚Äì July 1992 Transnistrian War. Before the war, opposition to Moldovan nationalism increased and raids and attempts to seize the territory took place. Russian soldiers sided with the separatists during the conflict, with members of the Russian 14th Army providing weapons to the new Transnistrian military force. In December 1991, 14th Army commander G. I. Yakovlev also became the head of the Transnistrian military. The ceasefire in July of that year created a security zone composed of five Russian battalions, three Moldovan battalions and two battalions from Transnistria. During the war, some villages in central Transnistria rebelled against the separatist authorities. Some villages on the eastern bank of the Dniester (including Cocieri, Mahala, and Pohrebea) remain under Moldovan control, and some areas on the west bank of the Dniester (including the city of Bender) are controlled by Transnistrian forces.  Russian forces in Transnistria  Peace-keeping forces from each side, including a contingent from Russia, patrol the security zone. A Joint Control Commission (consisting of Moldovan, Transnistrian, and Russian forces) oversees the security zone, and the OSCE is an observer. Moldova objects to Russian forces in Transnistria, saying that it violates their sovereignty. Moldova's neutrality is codified in its constitution: \\"The Republic of Moldova declares its permanent neutrality and does not admit the stationing of foreign military units on its territory\\". In 1994, Russia and Moldova signed an agreement that Russia would withdraw its troops three years after ratification; however, the Russian Duma did not ratify it. During the 1999 OSCE Summit in Istanbul, Russia committed to withdraw its troops from Transnistria by the end of 2002. Again, the Russian Duma did not ratify the Istanbul accords. In an 18 November 2008 NATO resolution, Russia was urged \\"to respect its commitments which were taken at the Istanbul OSCE Summit in 1999 and has to withdraw its illegal military presence from the Transnistrian region of Moldova in the nearest future\\". Vadim Pisari, a Moldovan civilian, drove through a security-zone checkpoint in 2012 and was fatally injured by a Russian soldier. The incident heightened tensions between Russia and Moldova and led to further debate about the continued presence of the Russian contingent. Moldovans protested, particularly outside the Russian embassy in Chi»ôinƒÉu (the Moldovan capital), calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the region. In 2018, the Russian contingent remained in the security zone. Status and negotiations There are no Moldovan-representative offices, consulates or embassies in Transnistria. Transnistrian sovereignty is recognised by three polities: Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and South Ossetia. Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia are members of the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations, an organisation of states in the former USSR which have limited international recognition. Although Russia does not recognise Transnistria as an independent state, it maintains a consulate in Tiraspol (the Transnistrian capital). The Moscow Memorandum of 1997, also known as the Primakov Memorandum, is an agreement signed by Moldovan president Petru Lucinschi and Transnistrian president Igor Smirnov establishing legal and state relations between Moldova and Transnistria. Both parties reaffirmed the ceasefire agreement, and mediation efforts involving Russia, Ukraine, and the OSCE were asked to continue. The Kozak memorandum of 2003 was a further attempt to negotiate solutions of the dispute. Discussions between Moldovan president Vladimir Voronin and Transnistria's Igor Smirnov were mediated by Russian politician (and Putin ally) Dmitry Kozak. A core tenet of the proposal was the creation of an asymmetric federation, with Moldova constituting the majority and Transnistria the minority. The proposal would have allowed for Transnistria to veto future changes to the constitution of the new federation, and would have permitted a Russian peacekeeping contingent in Transnistria until 2020. Controversy arose over the potential number of seats allocated to Transnistria in the future senate, and the continued presence of Russian forces triggered a backlash from Moldova. The document was rejected due to the pressure it placed on Voronin. In 2005, the US and the EU joined the Moldovan- Transnistrian negotiations as observers. Including Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, the negotiations have become known as the 5+2 talks. Informal negotiations were held between 2006 and 2011, due to Transnistrian frustration with Moldovan and Ukrainian attempts to monitor the disputed border. Although the talks are ongoing, there is no agreement on the political status of Transnistria. On 20 September 2017, the Parliament of Transnistria unanimously approved a request to the United Nations for observer status. The request, sent to UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres and President of the UN General Assembly Miroslav Lajƒç√°k, also asked the UN to establish a permanent international working group and to condemn actions which lead to \\"the violation of unalienable rights and freedom ... and ... the rise in tensions in the whole region\\". The request cited Palestine, which is not a member of the UN but has observer status. On 22 June 2018, Moldova submitted a UN resolution calling for the \\"complete and unconditional withdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory of the Republic of Moldova, including Transnistria\\". Sixty-four member states voted in favour of the resolution, 83 abstained, and 15 voted against it. States opposing the resolution included Russia, Armenia, and North Korea. = 2006 referendum = In 2005, Moldova passed a law about the \\"basic provisions of special legal status of settlements on the left bank of Dniester (Transnistria)\\" which created the Transnistria autonomous territorial unit (an administrative unit of Moldova). The law was opposed by Transnistria, since consultation with Transnistrian authorities was limited. On 17 September 2006, a referendum was held in Transnistria asking voters to choose between renouncing independence and becoming part of Moldova or claiming independence and becoming part of the Russian Federation. The referendum favored Russian to Moldovan integration, 98.07 to 96.61 percent. The OSCE, EU and many other states, including Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, did not recognise the referendum's results. The Moldovan law on basic provisions is still in force, and peace settlements could be complicated by its continued existence. Economic relations Moldovan- Transnistrian economic relations are characterized by crises and pressures. Although a significant portion of Moldova's industrial potential is in Transnistria (benefiting the latter's economy), a number of economic crises have increased tensions between the two parties. In 1990, Transnistria was responsible for over 40 percent of Moldova's GDP and 90 percent of its electricity supply. After Moldova signed the European Union Association Agreement in 2014, Transnistria could export goods to the EU tariff-free. As a result, 27 percent of Transnistrian exports went to EU member states and exports to Russia fell to 7.7 percent. Moldovan pressure has triggered an economic crisis in Transnistria; to pressure Transnistria to reintegrate into Moldova, the latter lowered the procurement price for Transnistrian electricity by about 30 percent in 2016. It is more difficult for the export- driven Transnistrian economy to access international markets, and opportunities to attract foreign investment are limited. This has resulted in rises of mass emigration and the shadow economy; due to Transnistria's lack of international recognition, it is more difficult to take legal action against companies associated with the shadow economy. In 2005, at the request of Moldovan President Voronin and Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, the EU launched a Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) to help limit cross-border criminal activity. According to the European Commission, EUBAM has three central objectives: \\"to contribute to enhancing the overall border and customs management capacities and the abilities of the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine to fight against cross-border and organised crime, to approximate the border and law enforcement authorities‚Äô standards to those of the EU, and to assist the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine in fulfilling their commitments under the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans (ENP AP) and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCA)\\". = Border customs dispute = Border checkpoint between Transnistria and Moldova at SƒÉnƒÉtƒÉuca. On 3 March 2006, Ukraine introduced new customs regulations on its border with Transnistria. Ukraine declared that it would import goods from Transnistria only with documents processed by Moldovan customs offices as part of the joint customs protocol agreed between Ukraine and Moldova on 30 December 2005. Transnistrian companies which want to export to Ukraine and Commonwealth of Independent States members must be registered in Moldova. The new customs agreement was criticised in Transnistria, with Minister of Economy Elena Chernenko saying that the de facto blockade cost Transnistria $2-2.5 million per day. Political rhetoric Public opinion about relations between Moldova and Transnistria has been shaped by the rhetoric of its leaders. = Moldova = Mircea Snegur, the first president of the Republic of Moldova, signed the ceasefire agreement ending the Transnistrian War. Snegur refused to sign the Primakov Memorandum, which was finalised after the election of the pro-Russian Petru Lucinschi as president. During the presidential terms of Lucinschi and his pro-Russian successor, Voronin, Russia pursued closer relations with Moldova. According to Mihai Ghumpu, acting president of Moldova from September 2009 to December 2010, the unconditional withdrawal of Russian soldiers and removal of Russian ammunition from Transnistria were prerequisites for a solution to the conflict. His successor, Vlad Filat of the Liberal Democratic Party, said: \\"The Transnistrian region‚Äôs statute is to be identified within the '5+2' talks. Moreover, after finding this solution, the final decision will be taken in Chi»ôinƒÉu\\". Marian Lupu, acting president from December 2010 to March 2012, also emphasized Chi»ôinƒÉu's willingness to engage in dialogue about the conflict. After the annexation of Crimea in 2014, many politicians and activists in Transnistria asked the Russian Parliament to draft a law for Transnistria to join Russia. In response, Moldovan president Nicolae Timofti said that any decision by Moscow to accept Transnistria \\"would be a step in the wrong direction\\". Pro-Russian president Igor Dodon, elected in December 2016, has indicated that Transnistria's attempts to gain independence have failed: \\"They either have Moldova or Ukraine to unite with. Nobody else ...\\" = Transnistria = Igor Smirnov was the first president of Transnistria, serving from 1990 to 1991 and from 1991 to 2011. His tenure was marked by attempts to gain independence, including the signing of the Primakov Memorandum. Defeating pro-Russian candidate Anatoly Kaminski, Yevgeny Shevchuk's 2011 election as president of Transnistria marked a new phase of Moldovan-Transnistrian relations. Although there was no consensus on political status, Shevchuk promoted improved communication links and the lifting of trade restrictions. At the 5+2 talks, Shevchuk rejected Moldova's call to replace the Russian peacekeeping contingent with a civilian mission and asserted the need for Russian forces to provide Transnistria with security. In the December 2016 elections, Vadim Krasnoselky of the centre-right Renewal Party became president; according to the BBC, Krasnoselky said that Transnistria should embark on an \\"evolutionary\\" accession with Russia. During national celebrations in September 2018, Krasnoselky said that Transnistria would still seek international recognition and the Russian peacekeeping contingent was \\"an important factor in preserving peace.\\" References See also *Transnistria War *International recognition of Transnistria *Political status of Transnistria Transnistria Moldova Politics of Transnistria ","title":"Moldova‚ÄìTransnistria relations"},{"id":"58328610","text":"Gates Hill is a mountain in Schoharie County, New York.

Confirmation is the public declaration, made by children or young adults who have already been baptized in their infancy, to follow the Christian faith in their adult life. The traditions of this ritual vary between the different branches of the Christian religion, however, the dress has remained similar across all of the denominations. The traditional design of the dress mimics the design of a bride's wedding dress relating to the historic view of young women in the church. Today, however, wearing the traditional Confirmation dress is not always enforced or expected. Rather, simple white garments, robes, or white dresses that vary from the traditional design are often worn.  Traditional Design  The main feature of the traditional Confirmation dress was to be 'perfectly plain' and 'simple'. In 1868, Harper's Bazaar described the ideal style as: \\"Swiss muslin dress with high neck and long sleeves. The bottom of the skirt is trimmed with a flounce a quarter of a yard wide. Bias folds simulate a Pompadour waist. White silk buttons close the corsage... A white veil completes the costume.\\" Other common traditional designs included a visible lack of shaping in the bodice to de- emphasize the female figure, with waist definition provided by a belt and gathered skirts. In April 1874, Harper's Bazaar stated that white dresses of white silk, tartalan and tulle were being made in abundance in New York for Confirmations and First Communions. These designs featured 'puffs' in the skirt and sleeves, and ruffle trims. A black dress was worn in the 19th century by many in the Netherlands as a somber recognition of the 'gravity' of Confirmation on the participants' lives. In 1868, Harper's Bazaar also described a common fashion of Confirmation dresses as black with a high neck and \\"close sleeves\\", worn with a black shawl, which was embroidered and trimmed with either a black satin ribbon or a fringe.  Symbolic significance  In the Christian religion, white garments are significant because the color symbolizes being pure and clean. In Confirmation, Christians are transformed by God and now share in His Holy Spirit, which makes them clean, thus, the white garment signifies that the wearer has been transformed. The white dress theologically aligns with a Bible passage in Revelation 7:9, that describes a great multitude of people coming before the Lamb of God, wearing white garments. The color white is also symbolic of virginity. Traditionally, the white dress and veil, are symbolic of the wearer's chastity, purity and obedience to God. Because Confirmation is a ritual that symbolizes the child's 'coming-of-age' and their dedication to Christ in their adult life, the bride- like design of the traditional Confirmation dress was symbolic of women's purity before marriage - as well as the theological concept that, while commitment to marriage is good, virginity is better. As the traditional design of the girls' Confirmation dress was styled after a bride, the same significance is true in wearing of the veil. Because Christian virgin women were seen as a bride of Christ and often wear veils, that accessory was also considered appropriate for Confirmation. The amount that the child's parents spend on Confirmation garments is indicative of their socio-economic status. Especially in the Catholic group performance of Confirmation, the more conspicuous styles and higher quality fabrics and accessories will make those children stand out from other confirmands. Confirmation is a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood is also symbolized in the Confirmation dress. Often girls still in their childhood wear clothing such as knee-length skirt which allows them to run and play. However, in Confirmation, young girls wear floor-length skirts or dresses symbolizing a transition from their old childhood garments to the attire of grown women. Modern Confirmation attire:commons:File:PrimeraComunnionContemporanea.jpg, 2012-06-10  Modern dress codes  Today, some parishes suggest Confirmation participants wear identical, gender-neutral clothing. This is often the case for white gowns which are to be worn over, and covering, discreet outfits, especially in the Roman Catholic churches The traditional white dress, however, is still commonly used in the ritual today with the same symbolic intent as previously. Often participants wear simple and elegant white garments that include the symbols of traditional design but follow modern but modest fashion styles. Many churches introduced a 'Confirmation dress code' for both males and females that effectively involves wearing their 'Sunday best' or 'Christmas/Easter best'. Dress codes are often regulated by the individual churches or dioceses, with restrictions as follows: *No sleeveless dresses or blouses. *No \\"backless\\" dresses or blouses. *No jeans, shorts or tight-fitting pants. *Dresses or skirts should be knee-length, or not more than 1-2 inches above the knee. *Dresses or blouses which leave the shoulders bare should be worn with a matching jacket. *Dresses or blouses should not have a low neckline. *Dresses or blouses should not be tight-fitting. *Dresses or blouses should not be made from a transparent fabric.  Representations  = Literature = In fictitious representations of the Confirmation, or First Communion, the dress is a traditional symbol. In these representations, the dressing of the girl before Confirmation symbolizes the parents grooming the girl into the traditions of the belief system. In the literary work of Olive Senior (in her collection of short stories: Summer Lightning & Other Stories) the traditional Confirmation dress is likened to the Biblical parable of the Ten Virgins. In Senior's writing, the similarity between the wisdom or foolishness of the women in the parable is compared to the innocence or maturity of the main character as she is prepared for First Communion. 'After First Communion' (1892) Carl Frithjof Smith :commons:File:After_first_Communion_(Carl_Frithjof_Smith,_1892).jpg, 1892 The Confirmation dress is featured several times in M. NourbeSe Phillip's 1989 poetry anthology She Tries Her Tongue, Her Silence Softly Breaks, especially the poem Over Every Land and Sea. In this poem, the whiteness of the Confirmation dress is contrasted against the wearer's dark legs and the 'stiff' crinoline. Described as being worn by a girl in the negative of a photograph, the white dress is represented as dark-shaded. The dress is later described as yellowing, just as the picture itself has yellowed from its previous white state. = Art = The Confirmation dress is also represented in art. For example, C. Chaplin's Girl at Confirmation Dress at Prayer (see image at top of page), where the dress is iconically white and round, giving a cherub-like effect Another painting that features the Confirmation dress is Carl Frithjof Smith's 1892 After First Communion. These images often include other symbols of Confirmation such as prayer books, candles, and prayer beads.  Feminist Response  For feminist religious scholars, the traditional adornment of young girls as brides when participating in the Roman Catholic First Communion ritual is perceived as an initiation into patriarchal disempowerment. The ritual is seen to be a 'push' for young girls to take up the role of bride and mother in what the scholar Jennifer Stith calls the \\"blind subjugation\\" of the patriarchal construct of Catholic ritual and doctrine. This view condemns the traditional style of Confirmation dress, claiming that it has a negative impact on the young girls partaking in First Communion and Confirmation and teaches a woman's position in the Catholic church is to marry and have children. Another feminist perception is that the confirmation attire is a symbol used to 'cover over' the young girls that infers a removal of their status as human beings.

It is set within Olympic National Park and is situated northwest of Appleton Pass. Its nearest higher peak is South Appleton (6100+ ft), to the south. Precipitation runoff from Mount Appleton drains into the Sol Duc River, and Boulder Creek which is a tributary of the Elwha River, thence into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. History T. J. Appleton Mount Appleton was so named to honor Dr. T. J. Appleton, who moved to Port Angeles, Washington, from the state of Michigan, circa 1897. He was a pioneering physician who made house calls in some of the most rural parts of Clallam County and was the first white doctor to treat Native Americans in this area. Appleton was also an eloquent speaker and published author. Later he was a three-term mayor of Port Angeles before he died in 1942. The first ascent of the mountain is unknown.Mount Appleton climbersguideolympics.com Climate Set in the north-west portion of the Olympic Mountains, Mount Appleton is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

During his active career from the 1950s through to the late-1970s, he chronicled an Iraq way of life that was rapidly being lost as the country embarked on a modernisation program. He documented people, ancient monuments and many facets of urban life in Iraq. He stopped taking photographs following the rise of Saddam Hussein, finding that he was unable to maintain his former optimistic outlook for Iraq's future. Life and career  Latif al-Ani was born in Baghdad in 1932.Some sources state that he was born in Karbala; See for example, M. Gronlund's \\"How Latif Al Ani captured Iraq‚Äôs golden era through a lens\\" in The National 6 May 2018, Online:, but all sources appear to agree that he grew up in Baghdad During his childhood, relatively few commercial photographers were operating in Iraq. The social and religious prohibitions on making images and figurative representations meant that Iraq was relatively late-adopter of photography and cinematography. A handful of photographers and film-makers, such as Abdul-Karim Tiouti and Murad al-Daghistani, had been operating in Basra and Mosul since the late 19th-century and the early 20th-century, but opportunities for young Iraqis to learn the art of photography were rare.Kalash, K., \\"In Digital Technology, Solar Photography is a Time- immemorial Profession, \\" Iraq Journal, Online: It was not until the late 1940s, when Al-Ani was an adolescent that the number of commercial photographic studios in Iraq's major cities, including Baghdad, proliferated.\\"The First Photographers\\", Iraq National Library and Archives, Online: (translated from Arabic) Al-Ani was first exposed to photography when, as a boy, he would help in his older brother's Mutanabbi Street shop which was adjacent to the studio of a Jewish photographer, by the name of Nissan. The young Al-Ani was fascinated. Noting the boy's interest, Al Ani's brother bought him a camera, a Kodak box, in around 1947, when al-Ani was 15 years. After that, the camera never left his side.Ruya Foundation, From the air, I saw things in a different way: photographer Latif al Ani reflects on his life and work, May 1, 2015 His earliest photos were of the everyday scenes and objects in his immediate surroundings- street life, palms, plants, faces and people on rooftops. This type of subject matter would become a recurring theme in his work. In the 1950s, he seized the opportunity to embark on a career in photography. A friend of al-Ani's, Aziz Ajam, was working as an editor for the Iraqi Petroleum Company's in-house magazine. Al-Ani applied for a traineeship there, and in 1954, he began working under the direction of Jack Percival, and effectively became his apprentice. While at IPC, al-Ani learned all aspects of photography, including aerial work.Leech, N., \\"Latif Al Ani: chronicler of modernity in a now vanished Iraq\\", The National 11 July 2017 Online: As a staff member of the IPC, he took photographs for the company‚Äôs Arabic-language magazine, Ahl al-Naf [People of Oil] under Percival's watchful eye.Leech, N., \\"Latif Al Ani: Chronicler of Modernity in a now vanished Iraq\\", The National 11 July 2017 Online:; Gray, L.A., \\"Through the Lens 1953‚Äì1979: Latif al-Ani\\", Art Asia Pacific July‚ÄìAugust, 2018 Online: In 1960, he founded the Photography Department at the Ministry of Information (subsequently renamed Ministry of Culture).

This type of work was not only a good fit with Al-Ani's own preoccupations, but also fitted with the government‚Äôs socialist agenda.

Following the 1975 Green March, on the course of Western Sahara conflict, the Moroccan state has sponsored settlement schemes enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara (80% of the Western Sahara territory). By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants in the Western Sahara region. Under international law, Morocco's transfer of its own civilians into occupied territory is in direct violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (cf. Israeli and Turkish settlers).https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/gaspd664.doc.htm  History  Western Sahara came under Spanish rule as a protectorate in 1884, wherein the territory extended from Cape Bojador to Cape Blanc. Spain gradually extended its control over the region over the next 40 years by negotiating with France. Spanish Sahara was formally established in 1958 after two earlier administrative districts, R√≠o de Oro and Saguia el Hamra, were combined. Amid pressure from nationalists in Spanish Sahara, Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria, Spain disengaged from Western Sahara in 1976. The remaining territory was divided between Morocco and Mauritania, frustrating Algerian leaders and prompting them to begin supporting a Sahrawi nationalist group, the Polisario Front. In the late 1970s, the group began conducting guerrilla warfare in Morocco and Mauritania, but Mauritania soon ceded its claim to the territory, leaving Morocco as the only state belligerent. The war with Morocco caused about half of the Western Sahara's Sahrawi to flee the area, leaving a gap for Moroccan settlers to fill.  Role in the peace process  Moroccan settlements have played a complex role in the resolution of the Western Sahara conflict. = Moroccan government support = The Kingdom of Morocco supports the settlements financially and administratively, with many incentives given to citizens who choose to relocate to Western Sahara. For example, government employees that live in the Western Sahara earn roughly twice the amount that their colleagues in the rest of the Kingdom earn. = Polisario Front concerns = The Polisario Front disagrees with the presence of settlers in the Western Sahara and sees them as a significant barrier to self-rule. In a 2018 conversation between Brahim Ghali, Secretary-General of the Polisario Front, and Horst Koehler, the United Nations Secretary-General's Personal Envoy to Western Sahara, Ghali noted that Moroccan settlements were a major area of concern. Specifically, the presence of settlers is significantly shifting the demographic makeup of the region, posing a significant roadblock to a resolution. For the Polisario Front, Moroccan settlers now constituting the majority of the population of Western Sahara precludes the possibility of an independence referendum. Wary that any independence vote would either force a union with Morocco or continue Moroccan dominance over Western Sahara, few are open to such a referendum without decolonization and the repatriation of settlers to Morocco.  International responses  The United Nations has attempted to mediate claims to the Western Sahara, with settlers being a major area of contention. In the early 2000s, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's Personal Envoy to the Western Sahara, James Baker, held multiple meetings with Moroccan and Polisario officials to discuss the future of the Western Sahara. They were ultimately ineffective and inflamed relations. Baker also put forth two peace plans that would introduce a four-year phase of autonomy to the Western Sahara and then put independence to a referendum-style vote. At either point, either the Polisario Front or Morocco denied the plan. Responses from other countries regarding settlers have been scarce. Though the United States Department of State, for example, has issued human rights reports for the Western Sahara, they have not made reference to settlers.

European coastline: modern (left), during the early Holocene (center) and during the Last Glacial Maximum (right). The early Holocene sea level rise (EHSLR) was a significant jump in sea level by about during the early Holocene, between about 12,000 and 7,000 years ago, spanning the Eurasian Mesolithic.D.E.Smith, S.Harrison, C.R.Firth, J.T.Jordan, \\"The early Holocene sea level rise\\", Quaternary Science Reviews, Volume 30, Issues 15‚Äì16, July 2011, Pages 1846-1860. \\"The rise, of ca 60m, took place over most of the Earth as the volume of the oceans increased during deglaciation and is dated at 11,650‚Äì7000 cal. BP. The EHSLR was largely driven by meltwater release from decaying ice masses and the break up of coastal ice streams. [...] The impact of the EHSLR on climate is reviewed and it is maintained that the event was a factor in the 8200 BP cooling event, as well as in changes in ocean current patterns and their resultant effects. The EHSLR may also have enhanced volcanic activity, but no clear evidence of a causal link with submarine sliding on continental slopes and shelves can yet be demonstrated. The rise probably influenced rates and patterns of human migrations and cultural changes.\\" The rapid rise in sea level and associated climate change, notably the 8.2 ka cooling event (8,200 years ago), and the loss of coastal land favoured by early farmers, may have contributed to the spread of the Neolithic to Europe.Chris S.M.Turney, Heidi Brown, \\"Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe\\", Quaternary Science Reviews, Volume 26, Issues 17‚Äì18, September 2007, Pages 2036-2041. During deglaciation since the Last Glacial Maximum, between about 20,000 to 7,000 years ago (20-7 ka), the sea level rose by a total of about 100 m, at times at extremely high rates, due to the rapid melting of the British-Irish Sea, Fennoscandian, Laurentide, Barents-Kara, Patagonian, Innuitian and parts of the Antarctic ice sheets. At the onset of deglaciation about 19,000 years ago, a brief, at most 500-year long, glacio-eustatic event may have contributed as much as 10 m to sea level with an average rate of about 20 mm/yr. During the rest of the early Holocene, the rate of sea level rise varied from a low of about 6.0‚Äì9.9 mm/yr to as high as 30‚Äì60 mm/yr during brief periods of accelerated sea level rise.Cronin, T. M. (2012) Invited review: Rapid sea-level rise. Quaternary Science Reviews. 56:11-30.Blanchon, P. (2011a) Meltwater Pulses. In: Hopley, D. (Ed), Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs: Structure, form and process. Springer- Verlag Earth Science Series, p. 683-690. Solid geological evidence, based largely upon analysis of deep cores of coral reefs, exists only for three major periods of accelerated sea level rise, called meltwater pulses, during the last deglaciation. The first, Meltwater pulse 1A, lasted between c. 14.6-14.3 ka, a 13.5 m rise over about 290 years centered at 14.2 ka. The EHSLR spans Meltwater pulses 1B and 1C, between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago: *Meltwater pulse 1B between c. 11.4-11.1 ka, a 7.5 m rise over about 160 years centered at 11.1 ka, which includes the Younger Dryas interval of reduced sea level rise at about 6.0‚Äì9.9 mm/yr; *Meltwater pulse 1C between c. 8.2-7.6 ka, centered at 8.0 ka, a rise of 6.5 m in less than 140 years.Blanchon, P. (2011b) Backstepping. In: Hopley, D. (Ed), Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs: Structure, form and process. Springer-Verlag Earth Science Series, p. 77-84. Blanchon, P., and Shaw, J. (1995) Reef drowning during the last deglaciation: evidence for catastrophic sea-level rise and icesheet collapse. Geology, 23:4‚Äì8. Such rapid rates of sea level rising during meltwater events clearly implicate major ice-loss events related to ice sheet collapse. The primary source may have been meltwater from the Antarctic ice sheet. Other studies suggest a Northern Hemisphere source for the meltwater in the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

He moved to Chandrapur in 2001 until 2006 when along with Arun Bhelke, he started the Deshbhakti Yuva Manch to recruit more youths for the banned outfit, Communist Party of India (Maoist). Arun was horrified at the brutal killings of four members of a dalit family on September 29, 2006 in Khairlanji village (Bhandara district) and the police and government‚Äôs attempt at a coverup. Arun was active in the post-Khairlanji protests ‚Äî the protesters‚Äô endeavour was to hasten the emergence of an uncompromising leadership among the dalits, and to find support for the dalit cause among the underprivileged kunbis, marathas and ‚Äúother backward classes‚Äù. He was also organising students in Chandrapur, some of whom (of the Deshbakth Yuva Sanghatan) have since been persecuted by the police. He was arrested in his late 30s on May 8, 2007 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on charges of sedition and spent four years and eight months at the Nagpur jail. Here he began to draw and these sketches marked the beginning of Ferreira‚Äôs book Colours of the Cage (Aleph). In 2008, Arun Ferreira started a hunger strike along with other imprisoned activists. Over the course of his sentence, Arun Ferreira had 11 cases filed against him under the UAPA and the Arms Act. After his acquittal in 2011, Ferreira completed his degree from Siddharth Law College and began working as a lawyer in December 2016. He then became a part of the ‚ÄòIndian Association of People‚Äôs Lawyers‚Äô and the ‚ÄòCommittee for Protection of Democratic Rights‚Äô. IAPL was created to gather lawyers involved in the legal support of collective struggles for people‚Äôs rights and in situations of gross rights violations. The main objective of the CPDR has been to educate people on their democratic rights as provided in the Constitution of India and struggle against violation of civil rights by the state as well as civil society elements. Arun Ferreira carried out social work with an NGO, Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which was a left-wing Indian association that sought to foment revolution against the British Raj, (the rule by the British Crown in the Indian subcontinent), by gathering together worker and peasant youths. This social work was deemed ‚Äúcovert Naxalite activity‚Äù which was cause for more charges. Arun works to protect rights of minorities and is critical of the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. Arun stated in a 2015 interview that there has been in increase in attacks on Christians and Muslims since Modi came to power. He believes the government is responsible for anti- minority propaganda and stirring feelings of hate towards minorities.  Arrests  = 2007 arrest and imprisonment = Ferreira was arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and imprisoned in 2007. He spent four years and eight months in Nagpur jail as a political under trial. He was kept in solitary confinement. During this time, he took up cartooning again. All of his charges were dropped in September 2011 only for him to be arrested again in 2012. He was released on 4 January 2012 with the dropping of all his charges. His lawyer at the time was Surendra Gadling. On his release, he published a book on his experiences in prison, titled Colours of the Cage. In his book, he detailed his own experiences of torture and solitude, the life of prisoners, and the policies that govern them. In his memoir, he recounted many instances of the harsh nature of the Nagpur jail and the harsh questioning tactics used by the police. While Ferreira was being questioned, not only was he interrogated by the local Nagpur police, he was questions by officers from the Anti-Naxal cell he was placed in along with the Anti-Terrorism Squad, the Intelligence Bureau and even the Special Intelligence Bureau of Andhra Pradesh. He was interrogated for ten days. After all preliminary interrogation techniques failed, he was transported to a Hospital where the government authorized sodium pentothal to be used for Ferreira‚Äôs narco-analysis where he was questioned while under the influence of the drug. This ensured that the forensic scientists and psychologists could get true answers about Ferreira‚Äôs background as an activist. While in jail, the Nagpur Police continued to carry out searches in Ferreira‚Äôs residence and spread the news that he was a high- ranking leader of the banned Communist Party of India and he was responsible for spreading violence around the country. Ferreira denies any news about spreading violence and harming citizens. On 29 January 2014, he was acquitted of all charges . = 2018 arrest = In August 2018, Ferreira was again arrested for connections to organizing ‚ÄúElgaar Parishad‚Äù, an event that marks the 200th year of the Battle of Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018. The Battle of Bhima Koregaon https://www.thequint.com/explainers/what-was-bhima-koregaon- battle-explainer is controversial in India with right-wing groups claiming that it was a battle between British and Indian rulers and left-wing groups claiming that the battle was a victory against caste-based oppression.

Within days, long- standing mobilization plans went into effect to initiate invasions or guard against them and Russia, France and Britain stood arrayed against Austria and Germany in what at the time was called the \\"Great War\\", and was later named \\"World War I\\" or \\"First World War.\\" Austria thought in terms of one small limited war involving just the two countries. It did not plan a wider war such as exploded in a matter of days. British historian John Zametica argued that Austria-Hungary was primarily responsible for starting the war, as its leaders believed that a successful war against Serbia was the only way it could remain a Great Power, solve deep internal disputes caused by Hungarian demands, and regain influence in the Balkan states.John Zametica, In Folly and Malice (2017) Others, most notably Prof. Christopher Clark, have argued that Austria- Hungary, confronted with a neighbor determined to incite continual unrest and ultimately acquire all of the \\"Serb\\" inhabited lands of the Monarchy (which, according to the Pan-Serb point of view included all of Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Hercegovina and some of the southern counties of the Hungary(roughly corresponding to today's Vojvodina), and whose military and government was intertwined with the irredentist terrorist group known as \\"The Black Hand,\\" saw no practical alternative to the use of force in ending what amounted to subversion from Serbia directed at a large chunk of its territories. In this perspective, Austria had little choice but to credibly threaten war and force Serbian submission if it wished to remain a Great Power.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2012). The view of the key figures in the \\"war party\\" inside the Tsarist government and many military leaders in Russia, that Germany had deliberately incited Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia in order to have a pretext for war with Russia and France, promoted by the German historian Fritz Fischer from the 1960s onwards is no longer accepted by mainstream historians. One of the key drivers of the outbreak of war were two key misperceptions that were radically at odds: The key German decision-makers convinced themselves Russia would accept an Austrian counter-strike on Serbia and weren't ready for or seeking a general European war, instead engaged in a bluffJames D. Fearon, \\"Rationalist explanations for war.\\" International organization 49#3 (1995): 379-414 at pp 397-98. (especially because Russia had backed down in both earlier crises, in 1908, and again over Albania in October 1913Clark, p.417); at the very same time the most important Russian decision-makers viewed any decisive Austrian response as necessarily dictated by and fomented in Berlin, and therefore proof of an active German desire for war with the Tsar's Empire. Key players and goals A small group made the decisions for Austria-Hungary. They included the aged emperor Franz Joseph;Joseph Redlich, Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria (1929) online his heir Franz Ferdinand;Dedijer, 1966) army chief of staff Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf,Lawrence Sondhaus, Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf: architect of the apocalypse (2000). foreign minister Count Leopold Berchtold, minister-president Karl von St√ºrgkh, and finance minister Leon Bilinski‚Äîall Austrians. The key Hungarian leaders were prime minister Istv√°n Tisza, minister Istv√°n Buri√°n, and advisor Lajos Thall√≥czy.Bridge, pp 10-19.Gerard E. Silberstein, \\"The High Command and Diplomacy in Austria- Hungary, 1914-1916.\\" Journal of Modern History 42.4 (1970): 586-605. online Austria-Hungary avoided major wars in the era between 1867 and 1914 but engaged in a number of minor military actions. The general staff maintained plans for major wars against neighboring powers, especially Italy, Serbia and Russia.Gunther Rothenberg, The Army of Francis Joseph (1976) pp. 97, 99, 113‚Äì17, 124‚Äì25, 159. The major decisions on military affairs 1867-1895 were made by Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen, who was the nephew of the Emperor Franz Joseph and his leading advisor. According to historians John Keegan and Andrew Wheatcroft: > He was a firm conservative in all matters, military and civil, and took to > writing pamphlets lamenting the state of the Army's morale as well as > fighting a fierce rearguard action against all forms of innovation. . . Much > of the Austrian failure in the First World War can be traced back to his > long period of power. . . His power was that of the bureaucrat, not the > fighting soldier, and his thirty years of command over the peacetime > Habsburg Army made it a flabby instrument of war.John Keegan and Andrew > Wheatcroft, Who's Who in Military History: From 1453 to the Present Day > (2001) p, 12. As Europe engaged in an arms race from the late 1890s forwards, Austria- Hungary lagged behind, spending the least percentage of its economic potential on its armed forces of all the Great Powers (2.6% of GDP vs. Russia's 4.5% in 1912). Clark, p. 217 Austro-Hungarian Chief of Staff von H√∂tzendorf's repeated urgings of \\"preventative war\\" against nearly all of Austria's adversaries at one time or another had no rational basis in the actual balance of military power. The far more realistic and cautious Franz Ferdinand, despite his deep personal affection for von H√∂tzendorf, realized that the rise of Pan-Slavism could rip the Empire apart, and he had a solution called \\"Trialism\\". The Empire would be restructured three-ways instead of two, with the Slavic element given representation at the highest levels equivalent to what Austria and Hungary now had. Serbians saw this as a threat to their dream of a new state of Yugoslavia; it was a factor in motivating the Archduke's assassination in 1914. Hungarian leaders had a predominant voice in imperial circles and strongly rejected Trialism because it would liberate many of their minorities from Hungarian rule they considered oppressive. Despite postwar accounts that attempted to make of the heir to the throne a convenient villain in favor of war, in fact Franz Ferdinand, as well as the most public figure of note in favor of improved status for the South and other Slavs within the Empire, was adamantly opposed to annexing Serbia or to war in general, insisting that the Monarchy was too fragile internally for foreign adventures. Except for a few days in December 1912, the Archduke repeatedly intervened in government debates during the various Balkan crises of 1908, 1912 and 1913, before his own murder, insisting that advocates of war with Serbia‚Äîmeaning above all Chief of Staff H√∂tzendorf‚Äîwere servants of the Crown who \\"consciously or unconsciously worked to damage the monarchy.\\"Hans Hantsch, \\"Leopold Graf Berchtold. Grandseigneur und Staatsmann\\" 1963, quoted in Clark, p. 291 Zametica argues that by 1909 war with Serbia was the main plan of the \\"war party\\" at Vienna. The long-term goal was to stop Russia from forming a Balkan league that would permanently stifle Austria's ambitions: :Defeating Serbia would effectively destroy what Vienna saw as a potentially menacing, Russian-inspired Balkan league, because such a league without Serbia would simply be a non-starter ... Last, but not least, a successful war against Serbia would at the same time solve the Monarchy's South Slav question‚Äîor at least ensure that Serbia could no longer play a role in it because the country would either not exist at all or it would be too small to matter ... In short, smashing Serbia would make Austria-Hungary the unchallenged master of South Eastern Europe. It was a dazzling prospect.Zametica, 2017, pp 562-63, After Serbia's spectacular military performance in the two Balkan Wars of 1912-13, even though Vienna succeeded in forcing Serbia's army to finally withdraw from Albania in 1913, the goal of maintaining traditional sway over Serbia gave way to alarm. Serbia had quintupled in territory, enormous French loans permitted a rapid re-armament and enhancement of its military forces Clark, p. 357 and Serbian newspapers were replete with calls for incorporating Serbian-majority areas of the Habsburg Empire into a Greater Serbia. Anxiety over the long-term survival of Austria-Hungary reached a new pitch of intensity among its governing elite. Relations with key countries Austria made several overtures for friendlier relations with Russia after 1907. However these were undermined by espionage, propaganda, and hostile diplomacy by France. Austria decided the villain was probably Th√©ophile Delcass√©, the French ambassador to Russia.J. F. N. Bradley, \\"Quelques aspects de la politique etrangere de Russie avant 1914 a travers les archives Fran√ßaise,\\" √âtudes Slaves et Est- Europ√©ennes/Slavic and East-European Studies (1962): 97-102. The one seeming success of this effort, a secret agreement with Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky for Russian compliance to Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia‚Äîitself predicted and assented to in numerous secret agreements between Russia and Austria after the Congress of Berlin‚Äîin return for Austrian support for Russian military control of the Turkish Straits, the Bosporus and Dardanelles, backfired spectacularly when the Russian press and nationalist politicians in the Duma pilloried Izvolsky, decrying the annexation as a 'humiliation' for Russia. Izolvsky then reversed himself, denying the secret agreement; only to be caught out when Germany ended the crisis by threatening to back up Austria should Russia attack over the Bosnian annexation‚Äîand threatening to release the secret documents that made Izvolsky's secret consent to the annexation a proven fact. The controversy destroyed Izvolsky's career, embittering him, and he became an ardent advocate of war against Austria-Hungary after Tsar Nicholas II of Russia dismissed him the following year, 1910, replacing him with Sergey Sazonov. Although Germany and Austria knew full well they would be outnumbered in a major war with the Franco- Russian Alliance (made in 1894 and perhaps the only unambiguous alliance in the pre-war constellation, that few doubted would perform as promised), they made no effort to develop joint plans, or to familiarize themselves with the other's strength and weaknesses. After the war started they remained far apart. Austria had deceived itself by trusting Conrad's elaborate plans, not realizing how bad was the Army's morale, how inefficient and cumbersome was the reserve system, how thin were its stocks of munitions and supplies, or how badly its rail network had deteriorated with respect to Russia in recent years. Year-by-year as Germany discovered the depth of the weaknesses of Austria's military, and Vienna's inability to remedy deep defects, it was increasingly necessary for Germany to take more and more control of Austrian military operations.Gordon A. Craig, \\"The World War I Alliance of the Central Powers in Retrospect: The Military Cohesion of the Alliance\\" Journal of Modern History 37#3 (1965) pp. 336-344 online In the period leading up to the outbreak of war, German policy-makers, from Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann- Hollweg to the mercurial Kaiser himself had convinced themselves that Russia was unlikely to go to war to protect Serbia, rather inexplicably (though indeed Sazonov had forced the Serbs to back down in the Albania Crisis of just the year before). Clark, pp. 416-18 Assassination On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand visited the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. A group of six assassins (Cvjetko Popoviƒá, Gavrilo Princip, Muhamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá, Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá, Trifko Grabe≈æ, Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá) from the nationalist group Mlada Bosna, supplied by the Black Hand, had gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade would pass. ƒåabrinoviƒá threw a grenade at the car, but missed. It injured some people in the next car and some bystanders, and Franz Ferdinand's convoy could carry on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them quickly. About an hour later, when Franz Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where Gavrilo Princip by coincidence stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. Princip attempted to take the cyanide capsule that had been supplied to him in Belgrade, but could not swallow all of it before the horrified crowd of Sarajevans attacked him (the police intervened to seize the suspect, who was on the verge of being lynched.).Clark, p.375 The initial reaction among the Austrian people was mild, almost indifferent; the Archduke wasn't particularly popular. Historian Z. A. B. Zeman notes, \\"the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday [June 28 and 29], the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.\\" Almost no one understood how critical the heir to the throne was in strengthening his elderly father, the Emperor's, preference for peace and suspicion of wars; and over a period of days public opinion, moved by the Archduke's last words to his Czech wife, Sophie von Chotek \\"Sophie, Sophie, don't die, stay alive for our children!\\" reported widely in the press, and the authentic revelations of Franz Ferdinand's devotion to his family, took quite a different turn.Clark, pp. 375-381 The assassination was not necessarily a great event‚Äîit was the reaction of multiple nations that turned it into one. Historian Christopher Clark compares Sarajevo with the September 11 2001 attacks in New York City. They both: :exemplified the way in which a single or symbolic event ‚Äì however deeply it may be enmeshed in larger historical processes ‚Äì can change politics irrevocably, rendering old options obsolete and endowing new ones with an unforeseen urgency.Christopher Clark, The Speepwalkers (2012) page xxix. Strategic plans & diplomatic maneuvering Conrad and his admirers took special pride in his elaborate war plans that were designed individually against various possible opponents, but did not take into account having to fight a two front war against Russia and Serbia simultaneously. His plans were kept secret from his own diplomatic and political leadership‚Äîhe promised his secret operations would bring quick victory. Conrad assumed far more soldiers would be available, with much better training. The Austrian army had not been experienced a real war since 1866, whereas by contrast the Russian and Serbian armies had extensive up-to-date wartime experience in the previous decade.James Lyon, Serbia and the Balkan Front, 1914: The Outbreak of the Great War (2014) In practice, Conrad's soldiers were inferior to the enemy and his plans were riddled with flawed assumptions. His plans were based on railroad timetables from the 1870s, and ignored German warnings that Russia had much improved its own railroad capabilities. Conrad assumed the war would result in victory in six weeks. He assumed it would take Russia 30 days to mobilise its troops, and he assumed his own armies could be operational against Serbia in two weeks. When the war started, there were repeated delays, made worse when Conrad radically changed plans in the middle of mobilization. Russia did much better than expected, mobilizing two thirds of its army within 18 days, and operating 362 trains a day ‚Äì compared to 153 trains a day by the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Herweg, 1997, pp 53-56. While the civilian politicians and diplomats of the Dual Monarchy were kept in the dark, the intelligence catastrophe of the Redl Affair (Austria's head of counter-intelligence having been unmasked as a Russian mole in 1913https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/redl_alfred ) ensured that Russia knew nearly every detail of the Chief of Staff's plans, as did Serbia. German decision-makers made a decisive mistake when they came to the conclusion that Russia would not risk war to defend Serbia. Even the Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, always apt to swing from one view to the opposite over a matter of days, if not hours, was consistent in his belief that the assassination of the heir to Franz Joseph's throne would be seen as an outrage that must be punished. He told a naval aide on July 6 of 1914 that \\"he did not believe there would be any further military complications\\" and \\"the Tsar would not in this case place himself on the side of the regicides. Besides, Russian and France were not prepared for war.\\".to Admiral von Capelle, quoted in Clark, p. 416 German assurances of strong support for Austria's ultimatum were conditioned on a fundamental misreading of the situation and its very real risk of triggering a general European war. There has been a tendency for the past century to over-emphasize the constant cries for war within the German military and ignore equally bellicose statements and planted press articles on the part of similar figures in France and Russia, from Marshal Joffre to President Poincar√© to the \\"war party\\" in St. Petersburg. Views range from the counter-revisionism of John Zametica, a supporter of and witness for war- criminal and pan-Serbian nationalist Radovan Karadzic at his trial in the HagueMark Cornwall, \\"Who Started the War?\\" Times Literary Supplement, April 13, 2018 to a nuanced revisionist view (Christopher Clark) that highlights domination of foreign policy by pro-war factions in both Paris and St. Petersburg that concealed (both during the crisis and after the war) their deliberate encouragement of Serbia to act provocatively and expect military support. One puzzle of the crisis was the slowness with which Austria-Hungary moved toward war with Serbia. This was directly related to the strong opposition of Hungarian Prime Minister Tisza to an invasion of Serbia, much less annexation of any of its territory. Tisza insisted on a diplomatic effort, and categorically ruled out a swift retaliatory attack.Clark, p. 423-25 Other than the ever-belligerent H√∂tzendorf, Berchtold and other decision-makers were concerned to establish via the (rather leisurely) criminal investigation of the conspiracy against Franz Ferdinand that indeed elements within Serbia, deep inside its military and government, were complicit in the plot. Ironically, the audience this patient investigation of the facts was aimed at most of all, British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, never seems to have given serious consideration to the question. Grey was remarkably detached in the early days of the crisis and showed no signs of being well-informed on the intentions of either Britain's friends or its adversaries. Grey only proposed a mediation effort after Vienna had delivered its ultimatum to Serbia, and in a highly unfavorable manner. Russian diplomats had insisted to the British Foreign Office that Serbia was blameless in the assassination‚Äîrather strongly contradicted by the claim of Serbia's Ambassador in St. Petersburg, Miroslav Spalajkoviƒá that Serbia had warned Vienna about the plot in advance (Spalajkoviƒá had also repeatedly denied that any such organization as \\"The Black Hand\\" existed; while its chief was in fact the head of Serbia's Military Intelligence!, Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá, known as Apis. Spalajkoviƒá also told a Russian newspaper that Austrian arrests of Serb militants in Bosnia might lead Belgrade to attack the Habsburg Dual Monarchy (!) before the Austrian ultimatum had even been drafted.).Clark, p. 389 Yielding to Hungarian objections and the fear of alienating reservists busy harvesting crops in the still majority-peasant Dual Monarchy, von H√∂tzendorf waited for the investigation to make progress. Many Army units were on harvest-leave and not scheduled to return until 25 July. To cancel those leaves would disrupt the harvest and the nation's food supply, scramble complex railroad schedules, alert Europe to Vienna's plans and give the enemy time to mobilize. Meanwhile, Emperor Franz Joseph went on his long-scheduled summer vacation. Austria depended entirely on Germany for support ‚Äì she had no other reliable ally, for though Italy was nominally a member of the Triple Alliance, earlier Balkan crises had revealed strong frictions between Italy and Austria-Hungary. Italy remained neutral in 1914 and instead joined the Allies (the Entente powers) in 1915. German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg had repeatedly rejected pleas from Britain and Russia to put pressure on Austria to compromise, erroneously believing the coming conflict would be contained in the Balkans. Kaiser Wilhelm II, having convinced himself that Serbia would give into Austrian demands (showing how out of touch he was by believing Serbia's acceptance of most of the ultimatum meant war would be avoided) on July 27, tried to communicate with his cousins George V of England and Nicholas II, but with the involvement of his Foreign Ministry . The Kaiser made a direct appeal to Emperor Franz Joseph along the same lines. By the 27th and 28th of July the secret partial mobilization that Russia had begun on July 25th was starting to become apparent to German intelligence assets, and the official line from St. Petersburg, that it was necessary to \\"safeguard peace by the demonstration of force\\" was about to collapse. Indeed, a Tsarist Russian general in 1921 looking back opined that by July 24 and 25 \\"the war was already a decided thing, and all the floods of telegrams between the governments of Russia and Germany were nothing but the staging for an historical drama.\\"Clark, p.486 More traditional historiography, as well as proponents of the \\"Fischer School\\" that places German militarism as the principal motor of war state that German military had its own line of communication to the Austrian military, and insisted on rapid mobilization against Russia. There is a curious lack of examination of the actual actions of the Russian Government, first in secretly attempting a \\"partial mobilization\\" from July 24- 29, and then being the first Power to begin a true \\"General Mobilization\\" on the evening of July 29th. The next day the German Chief of Staff Moltke sent an emotional telegram to the Austrian Chief of Staff Conrad on July 30: \\"Austria-Hungary must be preserved, mobilize at once against Russia. Germany will mobilize.\\".Margaret MacMillan, The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 (2013) pp 605-607.Gordon A. Craig, The politics of the Prussian army 1640-1945 (1955) pp 293-95. Even as the German government and military prepared to mobilize in turn, Wilhelm II and German diplomats frantically attempted to persuade Britain to stay out of the looming general war. Invading Serbia When he was finally ready, Conrad on August 12 sent his army south into Serbia, where it was decisively defeated with the loss of 100,000 soldiers. On 22 August he launched an even larger campaign to the east against Russia through Galicia, leading to catastrophic defeats in the loss of 500,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers. He blamed his railroad experts.Herweg, 1997, pp 52-53. Role and responsibility A French propaganda poster from 1917 portrays Prussia as an octopus stretching out its tentacles vying for control. It is captioned with an 18th-century quote: \\"Even in 1788, Mirabeau was saying that War is the National Industry of Prussia.\\" The map ignores the Austro-Hungarian role. Austria was not ready for a large-scale war, and never planned on joining one at its onset. Its war plans assumed a swift limited invasion of Serbia and perhaps also a ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù war against Russia‚Äîwhich it had little chance to defeat unless Germany joined in, which Berlin had promised to do. The first round of scholarship from the 1920s to the 1950s, emphasized Austria's basic responsibility for launching the world war by its ultimatum to Serbia. In the 1960s German historian Fritz Fischer radically shifted the terms of the debate. While not denying Austria's responsibility, he shifted the primary blame to Germany, for its longtime goal of controlling most of Europe. According to Fischer, the reason for that goal was to suppress growing internal dissent inside Germany. In the 1960s and 1970s historians briefly summarized Vienna's actions. Samuel Williamson in 1983 returned to an emphasis of the centrality of Vienna's decisions. He says that Austria's policy was not timid or indicative of second-rate power pushed forward by Berlin. Austria acted like a great power making its own decisions based on its plan to dominate the Balkan region and hurl back the Serbian challenge. Langston, \\"Emerging from Fischer's Shadow,\\" p 67.Samuel R. Williamson, Jr., \\"Vienna and July 1914: The Origins of The Great War Once More,\\" in Samuel R. Williamson, Jr., and Peter Pastor, eds. Essays on World War I (1983) pp 9-36, at pp 9, 29.Williamson. Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War (1991). Even those who emphasize Vienna's strategic dilemma, facing activity intolerable to any sovereign state now or then (\\"Before World War I, Serbia financed and armed Serbs within the Austrian Empire\\" Margaret McMillan, Op. Ed. New York Times, 12-13-2013 ) also point to Berlin's infamous \\"blank check\\" in early July that finally licensed \\"Austria-Hungary's mad determination to destroy Serbia in 1914\\" Margaret McMillan, interview with The Guardian, 7-25-2014 as central to the ensuing catastrophe. Still other impressively researched studies maintain with formidable documentation that Russian and French eagerness for war (the one-time Soviet explanation) has been overly discounted, along with sheer errors made by all the principal decision-makers: ‚ÄúThe war was a tragedy, not a crime.‚Äù (Clark's \\"The Sleepwalkers\\"). And even though some Austrian politicians embraced responsibility after the defeat (\\"We started the war, not the Germans, and even less the Entente\\" quoting Fritz Fellner in article \\"Austria-Hungary and the First World War\\", Alan Sked, Histoire@Politique 2014:1 No. 22 ), some contemporary historians have broken entirely with the conventional explanation of Austrian responsibility, finding that Russian and French encouragement of Serbia's provocative policies vis-√†- vis Austria-Hungary were part of a knowing desire for war by Russia and its French ally (according to historian Sean McMeekin : \\"As indicated by their earlier mobilizations (especially Russia's) in 1914, France and Russia were far more eager to fight than was Germany ‚Äî and far, far more than Austria- Hungary, if in her case we mean fighting Russia, not Serbia.\\" July 1914. The Countdown to War (2013), p. 407, quoted by Sked ) a viewpoint buttressed by a great deal of Clark's research. What can be said with certainty, after many decades in which the Sarajevo Assassination was treated as a trivial pretext for a cataclysm generated from all the general ills of pre-1914 European society is simply this: The one person who indisputably could have -- and would have -- prevented war with Serbia, and thus a larger European war; who could single-handedly block the Austrian \\"hawks\\" ... was killed by Gavrilo Princip's bullet on June 28, 1914.

Early life and family Margielyn Didal was born on 19 April 1999 in Cebu City, Philippines to Lito and Julie Didal. Her father is a carpenter while her mother is a sidewalk vendor selling kwek kwek. She is the second youngest child among five siblings. Career =Early years= Margielyn Didal started skateboarding with friends at the now-closed Concave Park in Cebu. When the park closed she and her friends struggled to find a new place to skateboard. She has narrated how she and her friends were apprehended by police officers and security guards when they were caught practicing in the streets and in abandoned areas, as well as one account of being barred entry from a shopping mall due to her having a skateboard. Didal's parents were initially skeptical of Didal pursuing a career in skateboarding but later supported her decision. She approached Daniel Bautista, who would later on be her coach in the 2018 Asian Games, and borrowed boards from Bautista's friends. Bautista said that Didal became better than boys in her area and recognized her talent. In around 2012, Didal started to compete in local tournaments in Cebu City, particularly those organized by Jeson L. Guardo of G-Concepts in Barangay Tisa in Cebu City. Sometime in 2014, she injured her right arm and in December of the same year severely sprained her ankle of her right foot, her dominant foot. The effect of the latter injury lingered for some years. To managed ankle sprain, Didal underwent months of therapy at Cardia Olympia and underwent intense assessment at the Red Bull High Performance Training Center in Santa Monica, California in July 2019. =Street League Skateboarding= Didal would later compete in tournaments abroad and secured sponsors. She became the first Filipino skateboarder to compete in the Street League Skateboarding when she participated in the SLS PRO Open in London, England on May 26, 2018. In the preliminary round, she finished fourth and advanced to the final round to finish eight overall. Due to her performance in the SLS, a local through an online open letter address Cebu City Mayor Tommy Osme√±a to build a skate park in the city as recognition to Didal's feat. Osme√±a then responded that if Cebu City will be the overall champions of the 2018 Philippine National Games, half of the prize money will be allotted for a sports park which will prioritize skateboarding at the South Road Properties. In the 2019 SLS World Championship in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Didal reached the semifinals becoming the first representatives of the Philippines to do so along with Christiana Means. Didal failed to advance to the final, with only the top eight skater advancing, finishing 14th overall with 20 points. =X Games= Didal was invited to compete at the X Games becoming the first competitor of any gender to formally represent the Philippines in the games. She participated in the 2018 X Games in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the United States. =Asian Games= She competed for the Philippines in the women's street skateboarding event in skateboarding. She trained for two months in the United States prior to the event. Didal won the fourth gold for the Philippines at the 2018 Asian Games. In seven attempts Didal accumulated 30.4 points to win the gold while silver medalist Isa Kaya of Japan and bronze medalist Bunga Nyimas of Indonesia accumulated 25 and 19.8 points respectively. She scored 14.2 points in her first two runs and garnered the highest points in the fourth run scoring 8.9 points, by performing the backside 50/50, 360-degree flip out for the first time in a major competition. It was the biggest points in the whole women's street park event. Following her achievement, she was named as the flag bearer of the Philippine delegation for the closing ceremony of the games. As a gold medalist in the Games she will be entitled to of bonuses, which she plans to use to help her family start a business. Cebu City Mayor Tommy Osme√±a reiterated earlier plans for his city saying that his sister has pledged a donation to build a skate park at the South Road Properties to raise awareness on her and the sport of skateboarding due to Didal's win. As of January 2020, talks are regarding the possible construction of the skate park are still being held. =National Championship= Didal participated in the inaugural Philippine National Skateboarding Championship held in Santa Rosa, Laguna in July 2019 where she won the gold medal for the women's street event. =South East Asian Games= During the 2019 Southeast Asian Games Didal won two gold medals in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games; in women's Game of Skate and in street skateboarding. Other recognition Time magazine included Didal in its list of \\"25 Most Influential Teens of 2018\\" recognizing her feat in winning a gold medal in the 2018 Asian Games which it said would \\"cement skateboarding's status as a serious sport\\" in the Philippines. Personal life Didal has a girlfriend, named Jozel with whom she has a relationship for five years as of January 2020. Aside from her coach, Bautista, Didal also looks up to Hong Kong national team coach Warren Stuart who is also one of her sponsors and Brian Siwojo of the 8Five2 skateshop as her inspiration in skateboarding.

The Labour Party again stood councillor Joe Sayegh (who was only narrowly defeated by Davis in 1935) as their candidate. Prior to the election several long serving Labour members of the city council were unexpectedly denied re-nomination.

In 2010, he joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine as Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery, Neurology, and Radiology and Radiological Science, and has since assumed the position of Director of Endovascular Neurosurgery and the Endovascular Neurosurgery Fellowship Program. In 2011, Coon performed one of the first FDA-approved endovascular flow diversion cases with the Pipeline Embolization Device (Medtronic) and adjunctive coiling to treat a giant cerebral aneurysm. This endovascular treatment of coil-assisted flow diversion avoided the expected functional impairments resulting from an open microsurgical vascular approach.  Research  Coon's research mainly focuses on clinical outcomes associated with neurovascular devices and cerebrovascular microsurgery. His efforts center on developing techniques to push the field of cerebrovascular neurosurgery forward in safe and effective treatment for cerebral aneurysms, arterial dissections, carotid stenosis, AVMs, dural AV fistulas, tumors, and spinal vascular pathology.

Lynam was born in Colwich in Staffordshire, son of George and Hannah Lynam, and was educated at Christ's Hospital School in London. After being articled with a London architect he joined his father's architectural practice in Stoke-upon-Trent, and in 1853 became a partner of the firm. His father died later that year.Charles Lynam thepotteries.org. Retrieved 30 August 2018.Charles Lynam Exploring the Potteries. Retrieved 30 August 2018. An early project was The Villas, 24 houses built for the Stokeville Building Society in Stoke-upon-Trent, some of which are now listed buildings. Lynam designed many public buildings in the Stoke-on-Trent area: these include the Public Free Library in Stoke-upon-Trent, and the North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary in Hartshill. He designed several churches in the area, including the Hartshill Cemetery chapels and Christ Church in Fenton, and restored many churches in Staffordshire and elsewhere. In 1857 Lynam married Lucy, daughter of local historian Dr Robert Garner, author of The Natural History of Staffordshire. They lived at The Quarry in Hartshill, and had 14 children. In 1882 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and in 1895 he brought their annual national Congress to Stoke. In 1899 he published an exhaustive study and illustrated catalogue of the inscriptions on the ancient church bells of Staffordshire. This work also served to illustrate his preferred method of working - as the North Staffordshire Field Club noted of him in their obituary of 1921: :\\"If, as was sometimes said, he worked rather in isolation, his results were freely divided [i.e.: were freely distributed and available to all who were interested]\\". In his old age he was elected Mayor of Stoke in 1903. Lynam died at Cliff Bank House in Stoke-on-Trent, on 21 February 1921. =Archaeology= His early work was done in Staffordshire church history, much of which remained in manuscript, and for which he visited every church in the county to make recordings with brass rubbings and also notes of inscriptions that might be worn away by time. From this early work he moved on to become an archaeologist, interpreting the ground plans of Croxden Abbey near Uttoxeter, and of Hulton Abbey near Stoke-on-Trent. His first published paper was on Croxden in 1868 and thereafter he continued to write for archaeological journals, and was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1895. In 1865 he joined the North Staffordshire Field Club; he wrote many articles for the club, and was elected their President in 1874 and 1894. The Club, in their annual Proceedings of 1892, also noted his tireless but more informal work in preventing damage to the remaining antiquities of the district: :\\"his portrait ought to be painted with a drawn sword in his hand, keeping off the restoring vandals from our ancient camps and beautiful mediaeval architecture, all traces of which he so jealously guards.\\" \\"Camps\\" here meant the ancient earthworks such as Iron Age hillforts and Roman stations. His knowledge of these was encapsulated in his chapter on ancient \\"Earthworks\\", written for the Victoria History of the County of Stafford. He also saw the usefulness of communicating with the public on such matters, and in 1921 the Field Club noted of him that: :\\"Much of it [his archaeological writing] was only published in casual form in newspapers\\". Even in his very old age, he continued to publish valuable new scholarly work in archaeology, such as his monograph Croxden Abbey (1911) which he produced when he was 82 years of age. At about this time he also supervised the ancient Roman excavations at Wall.

Although the ssNA-helicase motif was published as an RNA candidate, there is some reason to suspect that it might function as a single- stranded DNA. In terms of secondary structure, RNA and DNA are difficult to distinguish when only sequence information is available. ssNA-helicase motif RNAs are found in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The ssNA-helicase motif occurs upstream of genes that likely function as helicases, possible on an RNA substrate. Some evidence suggests that these genes are part of single-stranded RNA viruses (or presumably phages, as the RNAs are located in bacterial sequences). However, there is also a suggestion of an association with singled-stranded DNA viruses that infect plants. This latter potential association could mean that the ssNA-helicase motif actually functions as singled-stranded DNA. If the RNA is indeed part of a phage, then its location upstream of a protein-coding gene might just reflect the typical gene organization of phages, and not a direct functional or regulatory association between the RNA and the downstream gene. Therefore, it is ambiguous whether ssNA-helicase motif examples function as cis-regulatory elements or whether they operate in trans, and also whether they function as RNA or DNA.

In 1890 she published her first collection of poetry, Rythmes pittoresques, followed by a collection of prose pieces, L'Amour chemine in 1892. Two years later she published her second collection of poetry, Joies errantes. She continued to publish even more novels, poems, and articles throughout her life. She was married to the painter Georges Bellenger (1847-1915), who was well known for his lithographs.  Free Verse/Vers Libre  Although conventionally the innovation of free verse poetry is attributed to other 19th century french poets such as Gustave Kahn and Jules Laforgue, Marie Krysinska actually published free verse poetry in 1882, five years before other volumes featuring free verse poetry would appear in 1887 giving her a more authentic claim to the title 'innovator of free verse'H√©l√®ne Millot Marie Krysinska : Femmes po√®tes du xixe si√®cle Une anthologie, PUL, 1998 ; p. 153/154.

Along with Jean- Baptiste Coclers, Paul-Joseph Delcloche, Nicolas de Fassin, L√©onard Defrance and Pierre-Michel de Lovinfosse, he was one of the most important Baroque painters active in the Principality of Li√®ge. Life Nothing is known of his youth except that he was an apprentice to Englebert Fisen, another painter in the city. He seems to have then moved to Paris, where he studied under the portraitist Nicolas de Largillierre. After his stay in France, he moved on to Rome, where he worked in Agostino Masucci's studio. He returned to the Principality sometime before 1708. There he gained several commissions, including the decoration of the h√¥tels de ville in Maastricht and Li√®ge. He only definitively moved back to the city of Li√®ge itself around 1719. He also worked for several noble families, particularly the Oultremont family. Eleven paintings by him survive in the ch√¢teau de Warfus√©e, including three of the lord and seven portraits of members of the Oultremont family. He was also commissioned by several churches in and around the city. His Saint Benedict Taken Up To Heaven for St James's Church, Li√®ge is considered his masterpiece. Plumier also produced the high altarpiece for Li√®ge's churches of Saint- Remacle (Descent from the Cross) and Sainte-Catherine (Martyrdom of St Catherine)--the latter sagged and tore in July 2018 and is being restored in situ. Plumier had two sons, who both also became painters. Jacques-Th√©odore (Li√®ge, 1702-1766), painted Baptism of Clovis as the high altarpiece for the church of Saint-R√©my in Huy. Philippe-Joseph-Cl√©ment (Li√®ge, 1718-?) is recorded in Rome between 1739 and 1743 and a beneficiary of the fondation Darchis in the studio of Agostino Masucci. Plumier himself died in his home city and is buried in the church of Saint-Nicolas Au-Trez, whilst the city's Rue Plumier is named after him.

He has performed at international opera houses and festivals, and has recorded both operas and Lieder recitals.  Career  Born in Hamburg, Behle studied music pedagogy, trombone and composition at the music school in his home town. He took voice lessons from age 22 with his mother, the dramatic soprano Renate Behle. After graduating in trombone playing, he studied voice for five years with tenor James Wagner. In 2003, Behle changed to the class of his mother. He completed both his composition studies with Peter Michael Hamel and the voice studies with distinction. His first operatic engagement was at the Oldenburgisches Staatstheater. With the 2005/06 season, he turned to the Vienna Volksoper. From the 2007/08 season, he was for two years a member of the Frankfurt Opera, but has returned, for example to appear as Erik in Wagner's Der fliegende Holl√§nder, his first Wagner role. Behle performed Lieder recitals with pianists Sveinung Bjelland and Oliver Schnyder at major European festivals. He made his debut at the Bayreuth Festival in 2017 as David in Barrie Kosky's new production of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. A reviewer noted that he performed the role of the apprentice on the master level (\\"auf Meisterniveau\\"). Behle sang at major opera houses including the Berlin State Opera, the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, La Monnaie in Brussels, the Zurich Opera, the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve, the Hamburg State Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Royal Swedish Opera, and the Paris Opera. He made his debut at the Royal Opera House in London as Ferrando in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte in the 2016/17 season. He performed Mozart arias with the chamber orchestra of the Bayerischer Rundfunk and Schubert's Winterreise in the orchestra version by Hans Zender. He performed his version of Schubert's Winterreise for voice and piano trio at Wigmore Hall in 2015. Behle sang as a guest with orchestras such as the G√ºrzenich Orchestra, WDR Rundfunkorchester K√∂ln, Concertgebouw Orchestra, and Beethoven Orchester Bonn, and at festivals including the Kissinger Sommer, with the Capella Augustina in Br√ºhl (Rhineland) and with the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart. He worked with conductors such as Frans Br√ºggen, James Gaffigan, Andreas Spering, Christoph Spering, Markus Stenz, Jeffrey Tate and Sebastian Weigle. In concert, he was the Evangelist in Bach's Christmas Oratorio with the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra conducted by Thomas Hengelbrock in 2016. He appeared as Loge in concert performances of Wagner's Das Rheingold, at both the Elbphilharmonie and the Baden-Baden Festival. He sang the tenor solo in Mendelssohn's Lobgesang conducted by Pablo Heras-Casado at St. Cecelia Rome. He was the Evangelist in Bach's St John Passion with the Vienna Symphony, conducted by Philippe Jordan, and the tenor in Haydn's Die Jahreszeiten with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra conducted by Trevor Pinnock. In December 2017, he was the tenor soloist in Beethoven's Missa solemnis with the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Christian Thielemann. On 25 August 2018, he saved a concert of the Rheingau Musik Festival with Annette Dasch at the Kurhaus Wiesbaden with rarely performed duets by Schubert, Schumann and Brahms, stepping in at short notice and having a single day to learn mostly new repertoire, in a concert recorded for broadcast. A reviewer noted his nuanced and articulated rendition with a focus on the text, the dramatic vitality in scenes by Schumann, and the harmony with the soprano as the essence of Lieder singing.  Recordings  Behle's first CD, with songs by Franz Schubert, Ludwig van Beethoven, Edvard Grieg, Benjamin Britten and Manfred Trojahn, was cited as one of the best 15 new recordings by the Metropolitan Opera in 2009. Several of his recordings are held by the German National Library, including: * Goldmark: Merlin (Profi Medien, 2009) * Mozart: Die Zauberfl√∂te (harmonia mundi, 2010) * Schumann: Dichterliebe (Capriccio, 2011) * Strauss: Lieder (Capriccio, 2012) * Generation (Capriccio, 2012) * Vinci: Artaserse (EMI, 2012) * Humperdinck: K√∂nigskinder (Oehms Classics, 2012) * Bach (Sony, 2013) * Schumann: Der Rose Pilgerfahrt (Oehms Classics, 2013) * Brahms: Die sch√∂ne Magelone (Capriccio, 2014) * Telemann: Brockes-Passion (harmonia mundi, 2014) * Gluck Arias (Decca, 2014) * Strauss: Arabella (C Major, 2014) * Behle: \\"Gluck Opera Arias\\" * Winterreisen - version with piano trio and original (Sony Classical, 2015) * Mein Hamburg (Berlin Classics, 2016) * Schubert Arias (Deutsche Harmonia Mundi, 2017) * Wagner: Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg (Deutsche Grammophon, 2018)  Compositions  * Albern Werk for brass quintet (1994) * \\"7\\" for tenor trombone (1999) * D√§mmerung for eight trombones (2000) * Drei kleine Charakterst√ºcke for three trombones (2001) * Ein Tubaquartett (2002) * Tubaquartett '07 (2007) * Der Flug des Reihers (The heron's flight), song cycle (2008)Kissinger Sommer Kissinger Sommer 2008, p. 13 * Wiesn for brass quintet (2009), revised to Klabautermann (2015) * Winterreise in Trio (2013)Winterreise in Trio at youtube.com * Ringelnatzzyklus, after five poems (2013)Fritz Herzog: Tenor Daniel Behle zu Gast im Beethoven-Haus.

One of those associates, Fred the Count, has just robbed a safe. When the police arrive, Fred places a piece of jewelry from the safe into Blackie's pocket to throw suspicion away from himself. The plan works and Blackie is arrested and sent to prison. During Blackie's first year behind bars, Fred makes a play for Mary, but she rebuffs him. Meanwhile, Blackie develops a plan for breaking out of prison.

He is successful and is sent to the infirmary. While he is there he manages to escape during a violent storm, and makes his way to a hideout near a lumber camp. Unfortunately, the prison warden tracks Blackie to the cabin, but Blackie gets the drop on him. However, Blackie cannot bring himself to harm a defenseless man, so lets the warden go.

It aired on September 26, 2018, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Manny Coto, and directed by Loni Peristere. Plot Langdon refers to Timothy and Emily‚Äôs indiscretion and the murder of Evie as ‚Äúminor infractions‚Äù and directs Mr. Gallant to say his grandmother died in her sleep. He notes to Dinah that he was surprised to find her at Outpost 3 and she contends that she is not ‚Äúpowerful enough‚Äù to stop him. In her interview with Langdon, Mallory insists that she has no dark urges within her, however she does admit to feeling unsure of who she really is as a person. When Langdon tries to push her into admitting more about her fears, the young woman tries to flee the room but Langdon grabs her by the arm in an attempt to continue probing her. Finally losing control Mallory screams for him to let go and telekinetically throws him off of her. Langdon then lunges at her, and exposes his demonic form. However an unflinching Mallory retaliates by shooting flames out of the fireplace behind him, effectively disarming him and surprising them both by the revelation of her supernatural powers. Later, a troubled Langdon performs a Satanic ritual and calls for guidance from his father, cutting himself in sacrifice. He says that he thought he ‚Äúdestroyed them all‚Äù but that ‚Äúone survived‚Äù. Ms. Mead describes her false memories to Ms. Venable, including the memory of a blonde boy, and laments her artificiality. Venable admits that she has not been selected to move on to the Sanctuary. Mead suggests they kill the other inhabitants of Outpost 3 and venture to the Sanctuary on their own. In the ruins of Los Angeles, Brock stumbles upon a pair of cannibals while searching for Coco. The two claim no knowledge of the Outpost 3's location as a third approaches Brock from behind, but Brock preempts the attack and guns down the tribe. He then beholds a horse-drawn carriage pass him by. The Outpost 3 perimeter alarm sounds off and Mead and The Fist investigate. They approach the carriage and find it vacant, save for a trunk, not seeing Brock clinging to the undercarriage. Inside the trunk, Venable, Mead, and The Fist discover apples. Venable suggests to Mead that they poison the others. Outside, The Fist prepares to execute the horses and is killed by Brock, who steals her identification card and enters Outpost 3. Inside, Mallory ponders her unknown nature and Venable calls for a meeting. Venable announces that they will be celebrating Halloween in the form of a Victorian masquerade ball. Coco suspects the ball to be a ruse for announcing who has been chosen for the Sanctuary. At the ball, a masked figure approaches Coco; presuming the man to be Langdon, Coco ingratiates herself and offers anilingus. Back in her room, the figure takes off his mask, revealing himself to be Brock. She feigns happiness for the arrival of her ex-boyfriend, but Brock stabs her in the forehead. After everyone has had a chance to bob for apples, the purples and grays feast on them together. Venable and Mead have injected the apples with venom, and the inhabitants of Outpost 3 soon die. The pair seeks out Langdon in his bedroom, and Venable tells him that they will be making the selections. Langdon calls Venable \\"perfect\\" for the Sanctuary but Venable urges Mead to shoot him regardless. A perplexed and devastated Mead is unable to and executes Venable instead. Langdon consoles her by revealing that she was modelled after someone dear to him from his childhood. Langdon beckons \\"the only woman who ever really understood\\" him to be by his side. The song on the radio shifts to The Rolling Stones' \\"She's a Rainbow\\" as Cordelia Goode, Madison Montgomery, and Myrtle Snow descend upon Outpost 3. Cordelia resurrects their \\"sisters\\": Mallory, Dinah, and Coco. Madison straddles a bewildered Mallory and remarks \\"Surprise, bitch. I bet you thought you‚Äôd seen the last of me.\\" Reception \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" was watched by 1.95 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.9 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode has been critically acclaimed, with most of the critics praising the cliffhanger. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" holds a 100% approval rating, based on 18 reviews with an average rating of 8.13/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"\\"Forbidden Fruit\\" pushes Apocalypse forward, delivering on the gore, the glee, and most importantly, the girls.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4.5/5, saying, \\"So far, aside from a mention of genetic perfection, there hasn't been much of a tie-in to the world of the witches (or to the ghosts, for the matter, aside from Michael Langdon's presence). However, that connection was made more openly this week, after a solid episode which featured some very impressive visual trickery from director Loni Peristere. From the cold opening to the surprise at the end, 'Forbidden Fruit' is one of the most impressive editorial feats of the entire series, let alone this season.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+. She particularly praised the ball scenes, saying that they are \\"a serious mashup of various fairytale tropes: poisoned apples, a masquerade ball, and even a Cinderella figure yearning for greater things in the background\\", and also appreciated all the different twists of the episode. Finally, she enjoyed the cliffhanger with the Coven witches. Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 5 out of 5, with a positive review. Much like Rosenfield, she particularly praised the death scene of all Outpost 3 inhabitants, commenting that \\"I have never been so disgusted and so entertained in my life\\", and also liked the revelation about Mead's and Langdon's relationship. Finally, she really enjoyed the arrival of the witches, and the cliffhanger of the episode. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 6.8 out of 10, with a mixed to positive review. He said, \\"Once the music switched from Bread to Rolling Stones, and the Coven ladies majestically swooped in, things felt infused with more energy. There was a welcome supernatural lightness in those final moments that seemed to coat all the previous ugliness and stuffiness with a silver sheen. That's not to say the season's about to get exponentially better, but it was a very welcome shift from the Lazy Susan of aggravation these past few weeks have offered up.\\" References External links * American Horror Story: Apocalypse episodes ","title":"Forbidden Fruit (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"58331921","text":"Wind Vision is a digital television service introduced by WIND Hellas in April 2018.

While working as a cadet officer in the army, he killed 3 prostitutes and attempted to rape 5 more in the city of Drama in northern Greece from 1981 to 1982. The surviving victims' testimonies led to his capture on December 13, 1982 He was initially court- martialed and sentenced to two life sentences, but it was later reduced to life imprisonment. In the early days of his imprisonment he was particularly undisciplined and violent but by the late 1990s he turned into an exemplary prisoner. 22 years later, in 2004, he was released from prison. Papachronis now lives peacefully in Larissa, undisturbed by authorities.  Early life  Kyriakos Papachronis was born in 1960 in Xanthi to parents Erifili and Charalambos Papachronis. He also had a brother and a sister. The Papachronis family kept a cafeteria in the city where Kyriakos worked since he was little. When he finished high school, he stayed for a while in Athens, making a living from working in various hotels. He dealt with sports and excelled mainly in boxing (in which he was declared champion in the 90 kg class) and karate, in which he was also declared a champion.  Crimes  In the afternoon of September 9, 1981, Papachronis visited a brothel in the area of Profitis Ilias in Xanthi and requested the services of a 46-year-old prostitute. The coup, however, resulted in a fight, with the woman (as claimed by Papachronis) underestimated his sexual competence. He fled furiously to return a few hours later, stabbing the woman to death.Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ Œ£œåŒºœÄŒøŒªŒøœÇ: ¬´ŒüŒπ Œ±œÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒ≥Œ∫ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç œÄŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏ŒµŒøœÖ - ŒåœÄœâœÇ œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ≠Œ∂Œ∑œÉŒ±¬ª, ŒµŒ∫Œ¥. \\"Œ†Œ±œÑŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ\\", 2007, œÉŒµŒª. 182-183 His next victim, also a prostitute, he met on the streets of Drama. On December 20, 1981, while she was looking for customers, Papachronis followed her without her realizing, and stabbed the woman in the back. But her screaming attracted passers-by, and he quickly fled. Ten days later, on December 30, after she had left a screening of a porn movie, a 19-year-old student was attacked by Papachronis. He stabbed her in the cervix, but was seen by the girl's father, who was waiting for her, and fled. On January 15, 1982, Papachronis attacked a nurse while walking to the train station in Drama. He dragged her under the airbridge and knocked her out, trying to rape her. But he eventually changed his mind and left the woman alive, who was the first victim to give the police a precise and detailed description of Papachronis.On August 15, 1982, he accidentally met a recent acquaintance at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, a girl named Anastasia Alexandridou, and persisted for her to go with him. He then followed the girl to her house and asked to make love. Eventually, he closed her mouth, grabbed her and dragged the girl to an adjacent grove. There he pulled out his knife (which he always carried with him) from his sock and stabbed her in the cervix, ripping her clothes off and raped her. He left her there naked, stealing all her personal belongings and throwing them away near the Menemeni train station, keeping only her lighter (which would later link him beyond doubt to the murder of the girl). The victim died two hours later from internal haemorrhage and pulmonary asphyxia.Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒøœÇ Œ£œåŒºœÄŒøŒªŒøœÇ: ¬´ŒüŒπ Œ±œÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒµŒ≥Œ∫ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç œÄŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏ŒµŒøœÖ - ŒåœÄœâœÇ œÑŒøœÖœÇ Œ≠Œ∂Œ∑œÉŒ±¬ª, ŒµŒ∫Œ¥. \\"Œ†Œ±œÑŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ\\", 2007, œÉŒµŒª. 188-189 On September 21, 1982, he attacked a 23-year-old, who managed to escape. On October 1, 1982, after observing her, he attacked and seriously injured an 18-year-old girl outside her home in Drama. On October 25, he attacked in Xanthi, this time seriously injuring a 32-year-old prostitute. His last victim was a 30-year-old mother of four working as a cleaner, whom he stalked for several days before attacking her. On December 30, 1982, he stabbed her in the face and carotid, then vanished.  Arrest  The perpetrator's description by his surviving victims depicted a man wearing a military uniform, limiting the range of suspects. The involvement of military authorities in search of the killer, with the detailed conduct of investigations and monitoring of the movements of suspected soldiers, led to his arrest a few days after his last assassination attempt.Œ∫Œ¨Œ∏Œµ œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑœåœÄŒµŒ¥Œø œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒíœåœÅŒµŒπŒ±œÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±œÇ, ŒµŒØœáŒµ Œ¥ŒπŒøœÅŒØœÉŒµŒπ ŒµœÄŒπŒ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆœÇ œÑœâŒΩ ŒµœÅŒµœÖŒΩœéŒΩ Œ≠ŒΩŒ± Œ±ŒæŒπœâŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œå œÑŒøœÖ œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒøœÄŒ≠Œ¥ŒøœÖ œÄŒøœÖ œÉœÖŒΩŒ≠ŒªŒµŒ≥Œµ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄœÅŒøœâŒ∏ŒøœçœÉŒµ œÑŒπœÇ œÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøœÜŒøœÅŒØŒµœÇ. When the news of the attack was heard, two camp officers, Christos Triandafyllidis and Tasos Kosmidis, looked at the archives that night, and noted that few men were out of camp (due to a ban on leaving) and of them was Kyriakos Papachronis, who had arrived late. He was questioned by the campmaster, and due to the fact that he had no alibi for that particular evening and his apparent nervousness made the officer investigate his apartment. From this search, his knives were discovered, as well as the lighter he had kept as a trophy from Anastasia. He was subsequently arrested on December 13, 1982 by the Drama authorities. Papachronis refused to admit guilt on all charges at first, but the many inaccuracies, his erroneous answers, the heaps of recognitions from his victims, the lack of an alibi, and fatigue from the interrogations eventually led him to confess to everything he had done. He also admitted that on March 12, 1982, he had placed two bombs at the Post Office and at the National Bank of Greece's Xanthi Branch, and on the following day, he had placed two more bombs in a shop at the Alpha Bank Branch in Kavala. On June 16, 1982, he had placed another bomb at the door of his camp in Drama, and he was also responsible for a small arson at Kavala Airport.Œ†Œ∑Œ≥ŒÆ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±œÇ: ¬´ŒëœÄŒøŒ¥œåŒºŒ∑œÉŒ∑ Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÄœÅŒµœÄœéŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÑœçœÄœâŒΩ, Œ∫œÅŒØœÉŒ∑ Œ≠ŒºœÜœÖŒªœâŒΩ œÑŒ±œÖœÑŒøœÑŒÆœÑœâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒ≥Œ∫ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒºŒπœÉŒøŒ≥œÖŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ ŒºŒµœÑŒ±œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒµœÖœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±.- ŒúŒπŒ± œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ≠Œ≥Œ≥ŒπœÉŒ∑ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒµœÅŒØœÄœÑœâœÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±œáœÅœåŒΩŒ∑.¬ª Œ†œÑœÖœáŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆ ŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±œÉŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒªŒπŒΩœé (ŒïŒªŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑-ŒöŒ±ŒΩŒ≠ŒªŒªŒ±) ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÄŒøœçŒªŒøœÖ.

The trial, as expected, was largely covered by newspapers and television, with almost all the well-known journalists of the time, to deal with and comment on what is happening every day. The appearance of Papachronis in court, however, caused most of the comments ‚Äì mainly negative and positive ‚Äì since it was distinguished by great \\"theatrinism\\". He tried to justify his actions by constantly referring to his manhood, his courage, his natural rhyme and good looks, even reaching the point of rejecting the advocacy line of his lawyers, saying that ... \\"I have not built so many years this body to be destroy by psychiatrists.œåœÄŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄŒ¨ŒΩœâ, Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ¨ŒªŒ±ŒπŒø 5.4 Œ∫Œ±Œπ 5.5 His aggression and violent behavior by telling reporters that he would escape and massacre a lot of people, forced the police to dispose of 300 police officers for his custody in the four days that the trial dealt. Papachronis was accused of manslaughter, attempted homicide, and illegal possession and repeated use of weapons. They reported a total of 40 witnesses as well as four different psychiatrists who had been screened during pre-trial detention. Psychiatrists said that he was mentally and spiritually healthy - the court did not admit to any mitigating effect that his lawyers had advocated (neither the incomprehensibility of the acts, nor the lacking criminal record, nor his young age, nor the boiling of the soul), and sentenced him \\"to death\\", with 20 years' imprisonment. Approximately one year later, in July 1984, the Court of Appeal, in the second trial, sentenced him to death for two murders, 27 years imprisonment for seven attempted murders and 8 attempted rapes, 2 years in prison for possession of 9 weapons and 10 years deprivation of political rights.ŒïœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒØŒ¥Œ± ¬´Œó Œ≤œÅŒ±Œ¥œÖŒΩŒÆ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆœÇ¬ª, œÜœçŒªŒªŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ 31Œ∑œÇ ŒëœÖŒ≥ŒøœçœÉœÑŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ 1986  Imprisonment  His imprisonment began on December 13, 1982, immediately after his arrest and detention in a prison in Corfu. He proved to be a difficult prisoner, being aggressive and angry, with violent behaviour by participating in micro-riots in the prison and hitting his retainers. After his trial, he was briefly held in a military prison in Thessaloniki, where he was also troublesome, and in a fit of rage that lasted for hours he completely destroyed his cell. In 2000, when he was tried by the Three-Member Court of Appeal of Thessaloniki and the offenses he had committed during his imprisonment, he was charged with: \\"the sentence of life imprisonment and a temporary imprisonment of 23 years and 9 months for intentional and collusive homicide crimes, attempted manslaughter intentionally and by collision, dangerous personal injury, attempted rape, confinement, theft, illegal artillery, continuation of weapons of mass destruction, the theft of objects belonging to the State at a time of continuity, the illegal possession of weapons, the deliberate and violent explosion, the attempted explosion and arson with intent from which it could pose human risk in complicity with common fraudulently\\".Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±œäœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒøœÖ: ¬´ŒëŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒ∫œÑœåŒΩŒøŒπ Œ∫Œ±œÑ' ŒµŒæŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœçŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ œÉœÖœÅœÅŒøŒÆ¬ª, Œ¥ŒπŒ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ≤ŒÆ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒø Œ†Œ¨ŒΩœÑŒµŒπŒø Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆŒºŒπŒø, 2010, œÉŒµŒª. 130 Over time, accepting the situation, Papachronis began to calm down. In fact, after permanently settling in the Larissa prison, he began to read books on theology and psychology, paint, and spend time in the prison church. Unusual for a Greek serial killer, is the correspondence that Papachronis maintained during his imprisonment. With the profile of a nice and brave army officer, he seduced a certain category of women (\\"serial killer groupies\\", as they are called) who sent him love letters promising eternal love.http://menshouse.gr/istories/81151/i-yposchesi-pou-den-kratise-o- diavoitos-drakos-tis-dramas He was released from prison on bail on December 8, 2004, at the age of 44 after 22 years in prison. In his written statement to the press he wrote:  Psychological profile  According to Papachronis, the cause of his behaviour was the first time he visited a brothel in his teens. In particular, he argued that at the age of 14 while visiting a brothel in Xanthi, the rejection and embarrassment he experienced from the prostitute when he was unable to perform the sexual act gave birth to his hatred towards women. And the second attempt ‚Äì again with a prostitute ‚Äì was the same. This prostitute even mocked him in front of his friends, which was a major blow to his self-esteem. Papachronis was locked in himself, entertained by porn movies, and when he tried after a few years later with a prostitute, he failed again. This awakened his memories and hatred of women, causing his avenging fury. Psychiatrists who examined him said that the masochistic need to torment his body in order to reach the limits of his endurance drove him, since for Papachronis the physical rhyme was the only proof of masculinity. The narcissistic structure of his personality, on the other hand, created a host of other features such as intense anxiety, social immaturity, distrust and individualism. His need for sovereignty, and his inability to manage rejection, led him to extreme emotional states.Œ†Œ∑Œ≥ŒÆ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±œÇ: ¬´ŒëœÄŒøŒ¥œåŒºŒ∑œÉŒ∑ Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÄœÅŒµœÄœéŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÑœçœÄœâŒΩ, Œ∫œÅŒØœÉŒ∑ Œ≠ŒºœÜœÖŒªœâŒΩ œÑŒ±œÖœÑŒøœÑŒÆœÑœâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒ≥Œ∫ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒºŒπœÉŒøŒ≥œÖŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ ŒºŒµœÑŒ±œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒµœÖœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±.- ŒúŒπŒ± œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ≠Œ≥Œ≥ŒπœÉŒ∑ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒµœÅŒØœÄœÑœâœÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±œáœÅœåŒΩŒ∑.¬ª Œ†œÑœÖœáŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆ ŒµœÅŒ≥Œ±œÉŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒªŒπŒΩœé (ŒïŒªŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑-ŒöŒ±ŒΩŒ≠ŒªŒªŒ±) ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÄŒøœçŒªŒøœÖ.

Following in the footsteps of Mathilde Fibiger, she published her first novel Hvad er Livet? (What is Life?) in 1855, based on her own experiences as a governess. She went on to write five more novels and four collections of short stories. Biography Born on 9 April 1824 in Roholte near Faxe, Louise Cathrine Elisabeth Bj√∏rnsen was the daughter of the parish priest Frederik Cornelius Eberhard Bj√∏rnsen (1781‚Äì1831) and his wife Rebekka Adolphine n√©e Rabe-Holm (1786‚Äì1858). After her father died when she was eight years old, she was brought up by her mother together with her eight siblings. Her mother also introduced her to romantic literature. Bj√∏rnsen was inspired to write a novel based on her own experiences when Fibiger's Clara Raphael: Tolv Breve was published in 1851. Now living with her family in N√¶stved, she embarked on her novel Hvad er Livet?, mainly writing secretly at night. Using the pen name Elisabeth Martens, she finally found a publisher who brought out the first edition in 1855, shortly followed by a reprint. Later publications included En Kvinde (A Woman, 1860), Tre Fort√¶llinger (Three Short Stories, 1866), Hvad beh√∏ves der for at leve? (What is needed in order to live? Portraits, 1869), Sangerinden (The Songstress, 1876), Fra Fortid og Nutid, en Samling Fort√¶llinger (From the Past and Present, a Collection of Short Stories, 1878) and Skibldner (1883). She also contributed to journals and magazines. In all these works, she deals with conflicts experienced by emancipated women, presenting both the traditional and the more modern options for women of her day. Her works evoke the dreams and disappointments experienced by women who have confronted life, work and romance on their own. Her To S√∏stre (Two Sisters, 1890) deals with the evolving Danish Women's Society but takes a rather conservative approach. As a result, the book was not very well received. Following her mother's death in 1858, Louise Bj√∏rnsen spent her later years in Copenhagen where she died on 27 December 1899.

Later, she studied singing but lost her voice in 1930 due to severe cold. She developed paralysis of her vocal cord, which resulted in her famous trademark of speaking with hoarse, constricted voice. After several engagements at various theatres, Ida made an unprecedented late career as ‚ÄúRatschkathl‚Äù from 1949 to her death in 1956. During that period, she was very successful as a folk actress at the theatres in Nuremberg, Tegernsee, and at Platzl in Munich. Her role as Ratschkathl was unforgottenable due to the marvellous stage designer who created Elise Aulinger and perfected Ida Schumacher. Her famous figures included the Oardandlerin (Bavarian dialect for egg seller) and the Trambahnschienenritzenreinigungsdame (loosely translated as street car track cleaning lady).Ida Schumacher.

In: Martha Schad: Frauen in Bronze und Stein - M√ºnchen. Stiebner Verlag GmbH, 2008, S. 16 A street in her birth town, Arnstorf, is named after her. Her burial site is at Waldfriedhof in Munich. The plot number is No. 222-2-219.  Incident  During the night of 29 August 2020, her bronze statue and stone column were found detached from the fountain and toppled down. An attempt to pry the bronze statue from the stone base caused the damage to her anchoring. A brush was broken off from the stem and disappeared. An investigation is still ongoing with vandalism or collision with a vehicle being the probable cause.

History The mosque was commissioned by Mahmud Pasha, the grand vizier of Sultan Mehmet II Fatih \\"the Conqueror\\". Completed in 1464, it is one of the first buildings within the city walls built specifically as a mosque. Up to that time, Byzantine churches were converted into mosques. Architecture The mosque is designed in the Bursa style with the main space covered by a number of identical domes. This is an early Ottoman style which was soon abandoned in favour of the single large dome with smaller extensions. In this case, the main space is a 2x1 rectangle and is covered with two identical domes, each with a diameter of . The mihrab and minbar are located on the short side of the rectangle. The areas on either side are each covered by a simple sloping roof. The entrance to the mosque is similar to that of a Byzantine church, with an outer porch (exonarthex) and an inner porch (esonarthex), each covered by five small domes. The columns holding up the outer porch were originally marble but were replaced by the present stone ones in the 18th century after damage by an earthquake. The mahfil was added in the 19th century, and the mihrab and minbar replaced; as a result, they are in a different style to the rest of the mosque. The octagonal mausoleum (t√ºrbe) of Mahmut Pa≈üa in the grounds of the mosque is dated AH 878 (1473-74) on an inscription at the entrance. File:DSC04132 Istanbul - Mehmut Pasha Camii - Foto G.

Manufactured by Premier Rides, the ride is a collaboration between West Coast Customs and Six Flags that was promoted as the world's first launch version of a racing roller coaster. After multiple delays and missing the 2019 summer season, the ride eventually debuted on December 21, 2019, in a series of preview events spanning several weeks. It officially opened to the public on January 9, 2020. West Coast Racers is located on the former site of D√©j√† Vu, an inverted roller coaster removed in 2011, within a newly-themed land named The Underground, which replaced the former Cyclone Bay. History Six Flags Magic Mountain revealed West Coast Racers during a media event held at the park on August 29, 2018, along with a press release the following day. Park president Neal Thurman and West Coast Customs Founder and CEO Ryan Friedlinghaus announced their partnership in the design of the roller coaster, which was touted as having a record-breaking four magnetic launches. It would also feature four inversions ‚Äì three zero-g rolls and one zero-g stall ‚Äì along with 30 train interactions, which includes 14 track crossings and one \\"high-five\\" element across two laps around the course. The coaster would reach a maximum speed of and feature a number of airtime hills and overbanked turns that will occur side-by-side. West Coast Racers was originally marketed as the park's 20th coaster, but with the planned removal of Green Lantern: First Flight after the 2019 season, the park's total number of coasters remained at 19.https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2019/03/26/six-flags-magic-mountain- green-lantern-coaster-closed/ Construction began months behind schedule in May 2019 following a delayed delivery of finished track. The first pieces arrived reportedly later than expected in February 2019. Six Flags did not release an expected opening date, but Theme Park Insider estimated fall 2019 based on the delayed start. A construction update in July 2019 showed a significant amount of work left to complete. In October 2019, a writer for USA Today said, \\"Speaking of Magic Mountain, the Los Angeles-area park has not revealed anything new for 2020. It still has yet to debut West Coast Racers...\\" On December 12, 2019, it was announced West Coast Racers would operate during a series of preview events beginning on December 21, 2019. Access was given first to guests with select membership status, and on December 23, 2019, access was given to season pass holders, along with guests who purchased either a West Coast Racers t-shirt or the park's flash pass. The ride officially opened to the general public on January 9, 2020. Ride experience A pair of two-car trains, each holding a total of 12 riders, launch simultaneously from the station. They interact over thirty times throughout the course of the track, reaching a maximum speed of as the two trains cross the finish line. One pulls back into the station, while the other pulls into a replica of the West Coast Customs shop to listen to a narration given by Ryan Friedlinghaus. Both cars launch again and repeat the course a second time, producing a ride duration of approximately three minutes.

It opened on July 4, 2019, and was manufactured by S&S; - Sansei Technologies. The ride holds the record for fastest accelerating launch in North America at in 1.8 seconds, as well as the fastest inversion in the world at , and the tallest double inversion in the world at . History =Development= On May 4, 2018, The Pictorium, a 980-seat IMAX theater that opened in 1979 as the \\"world's largest cinema experience\\", was closed and demolished with little publicity, almost one year away from its 40th anniversary. From August 2 through August 23, 2018, Six Flags Great America released four episodes of a teaser series titled \\"Road to Glory\\" on social media. In the episodes, a racer appropriately named \\"Maxx\\" races around the park as referees cheer him on. On August 30, 2018, Maxx Force was officially announced along with the rest of 2019 attraction announcements by Six Flags. Ride time is approximately 25 seconds. =Construction= Shortly after Maxx Force's announcement on August 30, 2018, construction began in Carousel Plaza, forcing the nearby Whizzer to temporarily close and have a section of its track removed in order to place footers for the ride. Maxx Force then went vertical on January 15, 2019 shown at the American Coaster Enthusiast (ACE) event that took place January 19, 2019. On May 13, 2019, the last piece of track was placed toward the end of the ride. On June 12, 2019, one month after the last piece of track was completed, the Maxx Force coaster train made its first complete circuit after a few weaker launches to test the air launch mechanics. A commercial filming day was held on June 30. Media Day was on July 2, 2019 followed by a passholder preview the following day. The ride officially opened to the general public on July 4, 2019. Ride experience = Seating = Maxx Force features Formula one themed trains where riders are seated in 8 rows of 2 riders for a total of 16 riders per train. Each train has 4 total cars with two rows per car. Each seat is equipped with a lap bar and seatbelt. The lap bar also features shin guards and a pneumatic ratcheting system to lock. Each seat is constructed of fiberglass with a metal supporting frame, with a soft foam seat back and spine to protect the head and back during the immense speed of the launch. =Layout= After leaving the station, the train pulls forward into the launch area. The train sits in place while the catch wagon attaches to the front of the train before launching out of the area at a speed of 0 to 78 mph in just 1.8 seconds. The train launches under a low hanging bridge upon which the Great America Railway runs. It then goes into a \\"dog tongue\\" double inversion at 175 feet off the ground. As the train reaches the top it slows considerably, giving riders an excellent view of the park. The train exits the dog tongue and the riders experience a moment of weightlessness as the train begins its descent. The train then dives under the launch track while turning to the right. At this moment the riders experience the highest G-force of the ride at 4.5 Gs. The train enters a zero-g roll at 60 mph, the fastest inversion in the world. The train then enters a \\"Maxx Dive Roll\\", a double inversion above the station. This takes the riders through a semi-heartlined roll up and counterclockwise, as it suspends the riders 90 degrees to the right, before returning upside down and diving toward the ground. The train enters the brakes approximately halfway down the final inversion, then parks and returns to the station. The ride takes approximately 23 seconds from the initial launch to the final stop on the brakes. =Theme= Maxx Force's theme is based on racing. The train is based on the Formula One car, with similarly styled wheels on the front of the train, and colored red. The ride's entrance re-uses the old Pictorium entrance, painted red and grey with the ride's logo on it. The gift shop nearby originally named Carousel Plaza Gifts that sold Great America apparel was transformed into Victory Lane which now sells Maxx Force items and Great America apparel. World records According to Six Flags, Maxx Force held these records on opening: *Fastest acceleration in North America (0 to in 2 secs) *Fastest inversion in the world () *Tallest double inversion in the world () Although Kingda Ka has North America's fastest launch speed, Maxx Force's launch has the fastest acceleration as Kingda Ka takes approximately 4 seconds to accelerate to its top speed while Maxx Force takes under 2 seconds to reach its top speed.

The school was founded by a group of French Alsatians after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. It then became a model for reforming the school system under the Third Republic, and is still to this day a leading establishment of the French secondary education system.  History  The school was officially founded in 1874,. after three years of functioning, by teachers and Protestant academics from AlsaceNatacha Polony, ¬´ √âcole alsacienne : les raisons d'un succ√®s ¬ª, Le Figaro, 21 June 2010, . who came to France after the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by the German Empire during the Franco-Prussian War. The new school was an establishment for secondary education based on the model of the Jean Sturm Gymnasium, with the ambition of \\"producing a type of man who was cultivated, and combines the virtues of the regional soul with the general qualities of the humanist\\". The two first headmasters of the school, Fr√©d√©ric Rieder (from 1874 to 1891) and Th√©odore Beck (from 1891 to 1922), were both pastors and former students of the Jean-Sturm Gymnasium. Later, the school was headed by Henri P√©quignat (1922-1936), Jacques Vallette (1936-1945), Jean Neel (1945-1953), Georges Hacquard (1953-1986), Jean-Pierre Hammel (1986-1988), Ren√© Fuchs (1988-2001), Pierre de Panafieu (since 2001). The school rapidly became one of the testing grounds for public education, known as a \\"pilot school\\". Non-religious since 1874, mixed in 1908,The history of the education of women in France meant that mixed education was not generally used in the French education system until the 1960s. it insisted from its inception on the importance of French (rather than Latin) and foreign languages. It opened a gymnasium and science labs in 1881. Audiovisual methods of teaching were introduced in 1963, with the introduction of CCTV. Running from kindergarten to final year, the √âcole alsacienne is one of the most reputable schools in Paris. Students from the √âcole alsacienne often come from amongst the most privileged sectors of society, due to their selection and admission policies, and its geographic location. However, thanks to its scholarship system and due to the limited price of admission, it has maintained a relative social diversity, with strong attendance from the middle class. The establishment offers relatively few integrated places, as many students stay there throughout their school life. The admissions are mainly made in 6th Form (beginning of middle school), as more than half of the student body is admitted at this time. The school considered opening an establishment in Argenteuil, but the project never took place, due to lack of public investment.  Teaching  = General = The school uses active methods of teaching. Therefore, the growth of the child is placed at the heart of the education system, even to the detriment of spaces. Teaching of sport, plastic arts, and music is central, including in the creation of a classe √† horaires am√©nag√©s musique in the college. In order to empower students and their families, the school practices education without punishment or reward. Languages take an important role in the education. German is taught in the first years in the school, but Chinese has been taught since 1963. English courses are obligatory from the beginning of elementary school, and leads to intensive language courses in college and lyc√©e, particularly in the European (specifically English) and Oriental (particularly Chinese) sections. Since the 2000s, the Ecole alsacienne has offered exchange programs with some partner schools which includes Beijing Jingshan School, Sydney Grammar School, Theresianum Akademie, Daly College, St. Paul's School (New Hampshire), Maru A Pula School, Hotchkiss School, The Dalton School, Lakefield College School, Ashbury College. = Cost = As the establishment is a private school, education is paid for 912 euros per trimester; there are also scholarships.

In binaural unmasking, the brain combines information from the two ears in order to improve signal detection and identification in noise. The phenomenon is most commonly observed when there is a difference between the interaural phase of the signal and the interaural phase of the noise. When such a difference is present there is an improvement in masking threshold compared to a reference situation in which the interaural phases are the same, or when the stimulus has been presented monaurally. Those two cases usually give very similar thresholds. The size of the improvement is known as the \\"binaural masking level difference\\" (BMLD), or simply as the \\"masking level difference\\". Binaural unmasking is most effective at low frequencies. The BMLD for pure tones in broadband noise reaches a maximum value of about 15 decibels (dB) at 250 Hz and progressively declines to 2-3 dB at 1500 Hz. The BMLD then stabilises at 2-3 dB for all higher frequencies, up to at least 4 kHz. Binaural unmasking can also be observed for narrowband masking noises, but the effect behaves differently: larger BMLDs can be observed and there is little evidence of a decline with increasing frequency. Improved identification of speech in noise was first reported by J.C.R. Licklider. Licklider noted that a difference in interaural phase that was being used in unmasking is similar to interaural time difference, which varies with the direction of a sound source and is involved in sound localisation. The fact that speech can be unmasked and the underlying cues vary with sound direction raised the possibility that binaural unmasking plays a role in the cocktail party effect.  Labelling system  A systematic labelling system for different stimulus configurations, first used by Jeffress, has been adopted by most authors in the area. The condition names are written NxSy, where x is interaural configuration of the noise and y is the interaural configuration of the signal. Some common values for x and y include: * 0 means that the signal or noise is identical at the two ears * means that the signal or noise has an interaural phase difference of radians * means that the signal or noise has an interaural time difference, where the exact value of the time difference, , is specified elsewhere. * œÅ means that the noise has an interaural correlation of less than one, the exact correlation being specified elsewhere. * m means that the signal or noise is monaural.  Theories  Binaural unmasking has two main explanatory frameworks. These are based on interaural cross-correlation and interaural subtraction. The cross-correlation account relies on the existence of a coincidence detection network in the midbrain similar to that proposed by Lloyd A. Jeffress to account for sensitivity to interaural time differences in sound localization. Each coincidence detector receives a stream of action potentials from the two ears via a network of axons that introduce differential transmission delays. Detection of a signal is thought to occur when the response rate of the most active coincidence detector is reduced by the presence of a signal. Cross-correlation of the signals at the two ears is often used as mathematical surrogate for modelling such an array of coincidence detecting neurons; the reduced response rate is translated into a reduction in the cross-correlation maximum. The subtractive account is known as \\"equalization-cancellation\\" or \\"EC\\" theory. In this account, the waveforms at the two ears (or their internal representations) are temporally aligned (equalized) by the brain, before being subtracted one from the other. In effect, the coincidence detectors are replaced with neurons that are excited by action potentials from one ear, but inhibited by action potentials from the other. However, EC theory is not generally framed in such explicit neurological terms, and no suitable neural substrate has been identified in the brain. Nonetheless, EC theory has proved a very popular modelling framework, and has fared well in direct comparison with cross-correlation models in psychoacoustic experiments  Perceptual cues  The ear filters incoming sound into different frequencies: a given place in the cochlea, and a given auditory nerve fibre, respond only to a limited range of frequencies. Consequently, researchers have examined the cues that are generated by mixtures of speech and noise at the two ears within a narrow frequency band around the signal. When a signal and narrowband noise are added, a vector summation occurs in which the resultant amplitude and phase differ from those of the noise or signal alone. For a binaural unmasking stimulus, the differences between the interaural parameters of the signal and noise mean that there will be a different vector summation at each ear. Consequently, regardless of the stimulus construction, there tend to be fluctuations in both the level and phase differences of the stimuli at the listener's ears. Experiments have examined which of these cues the auditory system can best detect. These have shown that, at low frequencies (specifically 500 Hz), the auditory system is most sensitive to the interaural time differences. At higher frequencies, however, there seems to be a transition to using interaural level differences.  Practical implications  In everyday life, speech is more easily understood in noise when speech and noise come from different directions, a phenomenon known as \\"spatial release from masking\\". In this situation, the speech and noise have distinct interaural time differences and interaural level differences. The time differences are produced by the differences in the length of the sound path to the two ears and the level differences are caused by the acoustic shadowing effect of the head. These two cues play a major role in sound localisation, and have both been shown to have independent effects in spatial release from masking. The interaural level differences can give rise to one ear or the other having a better signal-to- noise ratio, which would allow the listener to gain an intelligibility improvement by simply listening to that ear. However, the interaural time differences can only be exploited by comparing the waveforms at the two ears. It is thought that binaural unmasking is the main mechanism involved. Successful models of spatial release from masking tend to use equalization- cancellaton theory to generate the effects of interaural time differences.

The remaining provisions of the Federal Border Protection Act were repealed in 1994. However, compulsory border guard service has not been enforced since 1973. Anyone who serves or served in the Federal Border Guard (German: Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS)) can no longer be assigned to the military service (¬ß 42a Conscription Law) in the German Federal Armed Forces (German: Bundeswehr). In 2005 the border guard was renamed the Bundespolizei (BPOL) (Federal Police) and any mandatory service would be performed there.http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/brd/1994/D840+94.pdf  History  The implementation of compulsory border guard service has to be seen in a historical context. Until the 1980s the BGS was organized as a paramilitary force that could be deployed nationwide, either at the inner-German border, but also elsewhere in case of civil disorder. Domestic military operations of any kind on the territory of West Germany were prohibited for the Bundeswehr at that time. The BGS used heavy military equipment and the officers were officially combatants until 1994. Furthermore, the member states of the Warsaw Pact maintained a very large number of Internal Troops, mainly staffed by conscript soldiers like the East German Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). Interior troops were a considerable reinforcement of the infantry forces during the arms race of the Cold war period and were not affected by disarmament negotiations as they were not part of the regular military. After the \\"German Emergency Acts\\" (German: Notstandsgesetze) were enacted in 1968, the tasks of the BGS changed slowly. The military task was gradually reduced, because in a State of Defence (German: Verteidigungsfall or V-Fall) the Bundeswehr was and still is thereafter empowered in very limited circumstances to be deployed in domestic disturbances. Nevertheless, the BGS was equipped with light and medium infantry weapons until the mid-eighties and still, now nominated as Bundespolizei maintains armoured personnel carriers like the LAPV Enok or Mowag Eagle.  Drafting of Border Guards  Men at the age of eighteen, or older if they were former members of the Federal Police or if they had not previously served in the military or federal police, can be drafted to the border guard service. Mandatory service can be introduced if there are not enough volunteers joining the federal police. If the need is covered by volunteers at a later date, currently drafted persons are to be released. The employment status of the draftees is similar to the status during military service. The service is divided into border protection basic service, border protection exercises and perpetual border protection service in case of defense and in the cases mentioned in article 91 of the constitution. After their service has been completed, members are transferred to the border guard reserve.  Current enforcement of the draft  Similar to the suspended conscription for military service since 2011, the compulsory border guard service is legally paused since 1994, but can be reactivated anytime by a resolution of the parliament.

He was a national champion three times as a coxswain and twice as a rower and won a gold medal at the 1962 Commonwealth Games. Club and state rowing David Palfreyman's commenced his association with the Mercantile Rowing Club in Melbourne as a coxswain at aged thirteen coaching veteran crews. He is the grandson of Cecil McVilly, a sculler who in 1912 was the first rower to represent Australia at an Olympic games.McV-P pin at Hear The Boat Sing He first made state selection for Victoria coxing the 1960 state lightweight four contesting the Penrith Cup at the Interstate Regatta. He coxed another Victorian crew who won the Penrith Cup in 1962. In 1961 and in 1963 he coxed Victorian men's eights to victory in the King's Cup at the Interstate Regattas in those years. In 1964 Palfreyman took up an oar and was successful in being selected to stroke that year's Victorian lightweight four. That crew won the 1964 Penrith Cup title as the champion state representative lightweight four at the Interstate Regatta. In 1972 and in 1974 he stroked the Victoria men's eights which contested the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta. In 1966 he stroked a Mercantile four which won the coxless four Australian title at the Australian Rowing Championships.. International representative rowing The entire winning Victorian King's Cup crew of 1962 was selected as the Australian eight to contest the 1962 Commonwealth Games. Their coxswain Norton was unable to make the trip and Palfreyman, who'd coxed the Victorian lightweight four to a Penrith Cup victory took the eight and steered it to a gold medal victory at the Commonwealth Games in Perth. That same crew was encouraged to represent Australia at the inaugural FISA World Championships, the 1962 World Championships in Lucerne. They financed their trip themselves, made it through to the final and finished in overall fifth place. The 1966 Australian champion coxless four which he stroked was selected in toto that year to represent at the 1966 World Rowing Championships in Bled. They missed the semi-final by a 0.04 margin and were eliminated in the repechage. Coaching career Following competitive rowing retirement Palfreyman had a thirty-year coaching career of school, club, state, national and Olympic crews. In some years he coached part-time at the Victorian Institute of Sport. For seven consecutive years from 1980 to 1986 Palfreyman coached the Victorian state women's fours who contested and all won the ULVA Trophy at the Australian Interstate Regatta.In 1932 he also coached the Victorian men's eight who came second in that year's King's Cup. He took Australian crews to six World Rowing Championships between 1978 and 1985 - lightweight eights in 1978 & 1984; a women's coxed four in 1979; and women's pairs in 1981, 1982 and 1985. In 1980 he was the coach of the Australian women's coxed four who rowed to a fifth place at the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

Overwork broke her health in 1878, and in the following year, she went to Kansas to recuperate. She returned to teaching in 1879 and again in 1883, in Hays City, Kansas. She was not able to resume writing to any great extent until 1883. In May 1891, she married Charles E. Griffith, and they moved to St. Louis, Missouri. The marriage proved a mistake. They separated, and Griffith returned to Whitewater, entering the temperance movement in 1883. For seven years, she was a lecturer and organizer of the Wisconsin WCTU, her illustrated lectures winning her the nickname of \\"Wisconsin Chalk Talker.\\" She wrote temperance lessons and poems for the Temperance Banner, and was a regular contributor to the Union Signal, writing the semi-monthly \\"Queen's Garden\\" for that journal. She also wrote for the Woman's News. Griffith published a temperance novel, A Woman's Evangel (Chicago, 1892), and a volume entitled Chalk Talk Hand-Book (1887). In 1889, she published the True Ideal, a journal devoted to social purity and faith studies. In 1891, she removed to Chicago, where she became a special writer for the Daily News-Record and afterward, society editor of the Chicago Times. Personal life She later married Mr. Miller and they removed to Anna, Illinois and then Peoria, Illinois where in 1918, Griffith died.

Under their leader Genseric, the Vandals crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into Africa and captured Hippo Regius in August 431, which they made the capital of their kingdom.Despite an uneasy peace with the Romans, Genseric made a surprise attack against Carthage in October 439. After capturing Carthage, the Vandals put the city to the sack and made it the new capital of their kingdom. Background Vandals Migration =In Gaul= In 406 the Vandals advanced from Pannonia travelling west along the Danube without much difficulty, but when they reached the Rhine, they met resistance from the Franks, who populated and controlled Romanized regions in northern Gaul. Twenty thousand Vandals, including Godigisel himself, died in the resulting battle, but then with the help of the Alans they managed to defeat the Franks, and on December 31, 406 the Vandals crossed the Rhine, probably while it was frozen, to invade Gaul, which they devastated terribly. Under Godigisel's son Gunderic, the Vandals plundered their way westward and southward through Aquitaine. =To Spain= In 409 his Godigisel's son Gunderic led the Vandals across the Pyrenees. They appear to have settled in Spain in two detachments. One, the Asdingian Vandals, occupied Galicia, the other, the Silingian, Andalusia. Twenty years of bloody and purposeless warfare with the armies of the empire and with their fellow-barbarians, the Goths and the Suevi, followed. The Silingian Vandals were almost exterminated, but the remains of the Alani a Turanian people from Iran marched across Spain and took possession of Andalusia. =Over to Africa= In 428 or 429 the Vandals set sail for Africa, upon an invitation probably received from Bonifacius, count of Africa, who had fallen into disgrace with the court of Ravenna. Gunderic was now dead, and supreme power was in the hands of his bastard brother, Genseric, (Gaiseric). Genseric was short and had a limping gait, was reckless with human lives and proficient at war. Probably in the month of May 428 he assembled all his people on the shore of Andalusia which in total numbered 80,000. The passage was carried out Bonifacius's ships. Soon, Bonifacius, returning to his old loyalty, asked his new allies to return and leave Africa. They, of course, refused, and Bonifacius turned against them, too late. Notwithstanding Bonifacius's opposition, the progress of the Vandals was rapid, and by May 430 only three cities of Roman Africa (Carthage, Hippo and Cirta) remained untaken. Siege of Hippo and capture of Carthage The siege of Hippo (May 430 to July 431) ended unsuccessfully for the Vandals. Peace was made on 30th January 435 between the emperor Valentinian III. and Gaiseric. The emperor was to retain Carthage and the small but rich proconsular province in which it was situated, while Hippo and the other six provinces of Africa were abandoned to the Vandals. Gaiseric observed this treaty until it no longer suited his purpose. On the 19th of October 439, without any declaration of war, he suddenly attacked Carthage and took it. The Vandal occupation of this great city, the third among the cities of the Roman empire, lasted for ninety-four years. Gaiseric seems to have counted the years of his sovereignty from the date of its capture. Though most of the remaining years of Gaiseric's life were passed in war, plunder rather than territorial conquest seems to have been the object of his expeditions. He made, in fact, of Carthage a pirate's stronghold and attacked, in his words, \\"the dwellings of the men with whom God is angry,\\" He created probably the only barbarian fleet and was for thirty years the leading maritime power in the Mediterranean. Gaiseric's celebrated expedition against Rome (455), undertaken in response to the call of Eudoxia, widow of Valentinian, was only the greatest of his marauding exploits. He took the city without difficulty, and for fourteen days, in a calm and business-like manner, emptied it of all its movable wealth. The sacred vessels of the Jewish temple, brought to Rome by Titus, are said to have been among the spoils carried to Carthage by the conqueror. Eudoxia and her two daughters were also carried into captivity. One of the princesses, Eudocia, was married to Hunneric, eldest son of Gaiseric; her mother and sister, after long and tedious negotiations, were sent to Constantinople.

More precisely, it is an early-Gothic building with Romanesque elements that dates back to the beginning of the 13th century (mentioned in 1208), partly reconstructed after World War II. It was the centre for the Cistercians of Trzebnica, which is why it was called the House of the Ladies of Trzebnica. Nearby, along the Kotlarska Street, were the Nowe Jatki, a medieval shopping center belonging to the monastery. The building was erected on a trapezoidal plan made of brick laid in a Wendish thread (two-wheeled, also called Slavonic). The Romanesque elements of this building, including the arches in the central part, are mixed with Gothic details of the windows and the arches of the vaults. On each of the two floors of the building there were originally three rooms. The building was repeatedly rebuilt, and remained the property of the monastery until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1810. During WWII the site around Bishop Nankier's Square was damaged. During the renovation in 1959,The discovery was made by Tadeusz Kozaczewski, art and urban historian. More on this: Encyklopedia Wroc≈Çawia, Wroc≈Çaw 2000. historic fragments of the oldest architectural foundation of the building located under the street level were discovered. From 1966 to 1969, the site was partially reconstructed according to the project of Henryk Dziurla. Over eight centuries, the level of neighbouring streets has risen to the height of the upper storey of the building, which is why the entrance today is subterranean. In the southern part of the lower storey there are fragments of the old barrel vaults, and on the upper floor, cross vaults. The building in use as a galleryDuring the reconstruction the ceiling was partially removed, joining the upper and lower storeys, and the whole building was covered with a contemporary reinforced concrete roof. The above-ground part was glazed from the outside. The place was then adapted for the needs of the art gallery under the patronage of the Center for Cultural Arts in Wroc≈Çaw (OKiS). Later, the gallery was transformed into Foto-Medium-Art Gallery, and become one of the most important Neo- avantgarde centres in Poland. Then it changed its name to the Lower Silesia Centre of Photography, \\"Romanesque House\\". From January 2017 it is called the Foto-Gen Gallery. In April 2017, a bronze plaque commemorating the Cistercian foundation \\"House of the Ladies of Trzebnica\\" was placed in the facade of the building and the name Dom Panien Trzebnickich (House of the Ladies of Trzebnica) came back into official use . Foto-Gen Gallery specializes in showing photography and new media. There are regular exhibitions for home and international artists, presentations as well as lectures organized there.

Early life Edosomwan is from Los Angeles, California, where he started playing basketball at the age of seven. His parents‚ÄîMuyiya Ololade and Kehinde Ololade‚Äîare both Nigerian immigrants, and encouraged Edosomwan to begin playing basketball and prepared him to attend Harvard-Westlake preparatory school in Los Angeles, where he was coached by Greg Hilliard. Edosomwon won a California state title with the school as a senior. Edosomwan received offers to play basketball from 39 NCAA Division I programs, including Texas and UCLA, but he turned them all down, determined to be accepted by Harvard. He stated his favorite memories of recruiting came when he met academic figures, not sports facilities. As his original SAT scores fell just short of being high enough to earn admission, Edosomwan completed a fifth-year of high school at Northfield Mount Hermon in order to earn admission to the Harvard class of 2017. College basketball career Edosomwan was the highest profile high school basketball player to choose to continue his basketball career at Harvard University, and its first top-100 recruit.

Edosomwan had a strong start to his junior season, contributing 13 points and 16 rebounds against Providence, 18 points and 15 rebounds against UMass, and 20 points and 9 rebounds versus Boston College. His best game, however, came against Oklahoma where he had 25 points and 16 rebounds in the final of the Diamond Head Classic.

FAI research has been used by both sides of the political spectrum in Scottish Parliament. Since 1975, the Fraser of Allander Institute has produced a quarterly economic commentary on Scotland. The Fraser of Allander Institute Economic Commentary provides an analysis of current economic performance, as well as examining future opportunities and risks within the Scottish economy. This includes forecasts for both the labour market and economic growth, as well as a section on government policy. The economic commentary is also used as a platform by leading experts in academia and other sectors to share their research in the Economic Perspectives section. Since 2016, the FAI has published a yearly report, studying the Scottish budget. The research analyses the effect of economic, budgetary and policy changes on the Scottish economy. This report receives widespread media and political coverage.

It studies a number of business trends in the Scottish economy, such as optimism, sales and investment, and examines individual sectors within the Scottish economy. Each quarter, various newspapers and publications cover the economic survey as an indicator of general economic performance in Scotland. The FAI also produces the Scottish Business monitor on a quarterly basis in partnership with the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Scottish Business Monitor examines a range of business indicators including volume of business, turnover, investment and export activity. It is frequently mentioned in both Scottish and UK-wide press. In partnership with Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, the FAI also produces a quarterly report into the oil & gas industry in Scotland. = Allander series = The Allander series was produced by the FAI to study the economic future of Scotland. The series has had contributions from a number of notable economists. These have included Heather Joshi, Robert E. Wright and Nicholas Crafts. Other notable contributors include James Heckman and Paul Krugman, both winners of the Nobel prize in Economics, as well as William Baumol who was shortlisted for the Nobel prize in Economics.

The content from the series has contributed to building various economic models and strategies, including the Scottish government's economic strategy. = Notable outputs = In March 2018, the FAI released its economic commentary on the Scottish economy. The commentary's criticism of the ‚Äòcluttered policy landscape‚Äô within the Scottish Government was debated in Parliament and also received global press coverage.  Commissioned works  = Specialist research = In 2014, the FAI produced a paper studying the links between constitutional change and inequality affected Scotland. It was published in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy. Following the Brexit vote, the FAI carried out research into the potential effects of Brexit on different sectors within the Scottish economy. The study covered the various outcomes of Brexit and how it could affect Scotland. A bad outcome for Scotland could result in a reduction in GDP of ¬£8 billion, jobs by 80,000 and wages an average of ¬£2,000 per year. While the report showed that a Hard Brexit could lead to problems, it was stated that some sectors in Scotland would fare quite well, when compared to the rest of the UK. In August 2018, the FAI has published a survey of Scottish businesses on their preparations for Brexit. The survey found that 44% of the Scottish businesses had noted a negative impact since the referendum on European Union membership.  Consultancy projects  The FAI studied the economic impact of college graduates in Scotland. The research showed that colleges could generate ¬£20 billion for the Scottish economy. In March 2018, the FAI was commissioned to research the economic impact of the commercial property sector on the Scottish economy.

The name \\"stereochromy\\" was first used in about 1825 by Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs and Schlotthaurer. In the original technique, pigments were applied to plaster or stone and sealed with water glass to preserve and enhance the colors. The method was then improved in the 1880s by Adolf Wilhelm Keim and renamed mineral paintingMayer, Ralph. A Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques, Harper and Row Publishers, New York, 1969 or Keim's process. Keim's process Keim's process was reported in 1884 at the Royal Society of Arts in London, by chemist and craftsman Adolf Wilhelm Keim of Munich, as an improvement on the earlier stereochromy technique of Schlotthaner and von Fuchs. =The process= *First, the surface to be painted is prepared by removing any damp bricks, overly burnt bricks, or decayed wood, and replacing these, and also removing any existing traces of stucco. *The surface is then coated with a mixture of quartz sand, infusorial earth (calcined fossil meal), and powdered marble, mixed four parts to one with quicklime slaked with distilled water. The purpose of this layer is to ensure adhesion of the subsequent layers to the surface. Next, a layer of lime-sand mortar is applied to even the surface, with care taken to avoid cracking. This layer is allowed to dry for up to a year. *Once dry, a painting ground composed of white quartz sand, marble sand, marble meal, and infusorial earth is combined eight parts to one with slaked lime, and applied to the surface at a thickness of one eighth to one quarter inch. This layer dries for several days, at which point a crust of carbonate has formed on the surface. This crust is removed with a mixture of one part hydrofluosilicic acid to three parts distilled water, which is brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, after which the surface is rinsed with distilled water. *A hardening fluid of one part potassium silicate to two parts water is then brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, before a second layer is applied and allowed to dry again. This surface may be painted immediately, or may sit unpainted for several years. *Pigments (selected from a set of thirty-eight) are treated with alkaline solutions of potash or ammonia to prevent color change caused by the alkaline fixative to come. Alternative pigments are best for those that cannot be used with an alkaline fixative. *Finally, the completed painting is fixed with an application of \\"waterglass\\" (sodium silicate) treated with ammonium carbonate, applied in a fine spray in several layers, until no more is absorbed. The chemical interaction of the fixative with the underlying pigments and ground create a material analogous to marble, and highly resistant to chemical corrosion. Keim's focus on carefully preparing the painting ground came from his study of older frescos and their state of preservation. Keim reportedly labored for twelve years to refine his process.

The √©tablissement La-Rochefoucauld is a private Catholic lyc√©e college under contract to the state and run by the Association La Salle. It is located in the heart of the 7th arrondissement of Paris in the neighbourhood of Gros-Caillou, not far from the Eiffel Tower. It consists of a kindergarten with 244 students, a school with 417 students, a college with 474 students, and a lyc√©e with 405 students, giving a total of 1540 students. The lyc√©e runs courses in bac S (specialising in maths, physics/chemistry and life sciences) and the bac ES (specialising in maths, economics and social sciences and politics), but not the bac L. In 2017, the establishment celebrated its tricentenary.  History  = From foundation to the 20th Century = La Rochefoucauld is an establishment which has always maintained close links with the life of the community around it. In the 17th Century, Les Invalides was created, bringing a number of families of artisans and workers of all kinds to the area. The neighbourhood was attached to the parish of the Church of Saint- Sulpice, Paris, but there was no church or school in the area. At this time, Jean-Baptiste de La Salle began to organise a community of volunteers known as brothers, devoted to the poor and humble. The number of children they taught continued to grow, and a brother arrived from Rouen with two other brothers from Saint-Yon, to create a school in the area of Gros Caillou. At the time, numbers were important due to the need for artisans at the √âcole Militaire and mansions. After the revolution, this ended, and the school in Gros Caillou was closed. Quite soon after the Revolution, a benefactor, the Marquise de Trans reinstated the school, helped by the brothers. Two hundred children won scholarships to the school, making the first free school in Paris. However, the funds of the Marquise de Trans were not inexhaustible. When she died, the Viscount Sosth√®nes de La Rochefoucauld, Duke of Doudeauville, helped by the inheritance he received from her, and from his important personal fortune, continued the tradition of education of the brothers and their founder. = Since the Second World War = Fa√ßade on rue Saint-Dominique. In the 1950s-1960s, private establishment began to sign contracts with the State, and La Rochefoucauld became one of the first to do so, thanks to the number of licensed teachers and the results obtained in the baccalaur√©ats. Since then, the establishment has prospered, although the brothers have left. Primary school classes take place on rue Cler, near the location of the Sisters of Saint Vincent de Paul. In 2006, the history of Catholic education in Paris led the La Salle association to include kindergarten education in Saint-Pierre, which began in September 2008. In 2008, the headteacher of the school was Didier Retourn√©, who succeeded √âtienne Roulleaux-Dugage. In 2010, the title moved to Guillaume Champagne. In 2011, J√©rome Dieuset and Christine Jeancolas succeeded Jocelyne Graux in the respective roles of head of sixth form and fifth year. However, in 2014, Christine Jeancolas succeeded J√©r√¥me Dieuset in the post of head of the sixth form. English began at the CP. The head of fourth and third year is currently held by Sophie Paix, and the responsibility for student life at the college by Marion Lesage. There are three classes at primary level, four at college, and two per series at lyc√©e.

He was the son of Vogeti Jaggarao Naidu and the grandson of Vogeti Apparao Naidu. He is well known for his long term tenure as honorary magistrate and municipal councillor at Rajahmundry. He was a wealthy landlord who owned more than 16 businesses at that time.  Early life  He was born into a very rich Vogeti Family of Rajahmundry of Meraka Veedhi Telaga family.His grandfather was offered to hold a vast tracts of land on his own and also get right on land attached to it to collect taxes as a zamindar, which he rejected and held the land on his own but was given the title zamindar. From then the family held the estates of Korukonda, Jambupatnam, Gummaldoddi, Kapavaram, Punyakshetram, Hukumpeta, Morampudi and also extensive landholdings in rajahmundry. He studied in Madras to complete his schooling which was later changed into Law College. Merakaveedhi Telagas had a very prominent role in the city as they were the Senathipathis and Samantharajus of Vijayanagar dynasty who came to Rajahmundry in the year 1757 after occupying the nawab fort of Rajahmundry serving for a century in maratha armies. Their family deity is Sri Venugopala Swamy and Vogeti family had already donated a lot to this Temple. For many years they are the trustees for the temple for many generations. they are Vaishnavas. From childhood Ramakrishnayya was raised as a Zamindari kid and was given respect for his behaviour. His childhood friends are Kanchumarthi Narasayya Naidu, Bayapuneedi Venkanna , etc.  Personal life  He was married to Subbayamma the Mother in law of Yerra Narasimha Rao, and the sister of Yerra subbarayudu the Musif of the District at that time and the daughter of Subedar Yerra Venkata Swamy and also the granddaughter of Subedar Major Sardar Bahadur Yerra Ayyanna. His son name is Vogeti Seshagiri Rao ,Zamindari Landholder part thereof Nandigama Estate whom he adopted from his daughter. He is married to the daughter of Muttangi Buchiramayya, Zamindar of Nandigama, Prakkilnka, Annadevarapeta, Jaggampeta and sister of muttangi Jaggarao, President of madras landholders association. His grandsons' names are Raja Vogeti Venkata Gopala Rama Krishnam Raju who married the grand daughter Sri Rajah Yenumula Ramanna Dora, Zamindari Landholder part thereof Thotapalle Estate who are also relatives to Sri Rajah Surreddi Family ‚Äì Zamindars of Rekapalle, Vogeti Lakshmana Raju and three granddaughters, Andalamma, Mangatayaramma, Subbayamma.  Political life  He acted as Municipal Councillor in Rajahmundry Municipal Council for a long time. He also acted as the justice of the peace, which gives the person judiciary power under the government that they can make their own decisions and pass laws instead of government which was a practise done in Zamindari system.  Social works  He worked a lot for the development of the city. He stood by the side of truth and strove to rescue many people from fraudulent troubles. . He also took care of Zamindar Kanchumarthi Ramachandra Rao when his adoptive father died in his very young age. Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu, former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh also studied with the help of Kanchumarthi Ramachandra Rao during the same time when he was under the guidance of Vogeti Ramakrishnayya. . Even Kanchumarthi Ramachandra Rao took the political hierarchy of Vogeti Ramakrishnayya. They had also started many rice mills with no profit for the benefit of people.  History  The ancestors of these Vogetis were the Senathipathis and Samantharajas of the Vijayanagar Dynasty. They came to Rajahmundry and settled there during 1754, when jaffer ali khan, the then nawab of Rajahmundry and Chichacole districts revolted against french general Bussy who convinced salabat jung, the then nizam of Hyderabad to possess northern sarkars(circars) dethroning jaffer ali khan. After the downfall of Vijayanagar dynasty in Chandragiri in 1652, last ruled by Sri Ranga Rayal, he was taken refugee along with his private council to bejapoor by shahji Bhonsle, father of the great Chhatrapati. Later in 1659 shivaji acquired behapoor and this private council thus entered into Mahratta armies and they continued in Mahratta armies. In 1754 when jaffer ali khan was dethroned he first formed allies with vijayanagar zamindar and later who withdrew his force to favour French who bribed him. Thus jaffer ali khan took the help of Mahrattas and they entered the country crossing ghats with 20,000 cavalry with the help of Bobbili Ranga rao. They burned down many villages of Vijayaramaraju of vizianagaram and also defeated him and plundered lot of wealth and stayed in Rajahmundry, and nawab used to live in Raja veedhi and there is Merakaveedhi is side to it where main body of Mahrattas camped, and later they lost to french and stayed few days longer and vacated. but a sect of families who are a close-knit clan and were descendants of governors of vijayanagar dynasty came back in the year 1757 after the Bobbili Siege and occupied the Nawab fort of Rajahmundry. Even now one can find swords used then. We can also notice that the people from these families call their fathers baba which is a Mahratta tradition and many more traditions can be observed different from all other telagas living in the country. Many names in these families are named after Nanaji, Baburao, Bajirao, and also many ladies were added with bhai. Thus they marry among themselves. Later they rose to power in the Military. They never wanted a Zamindari till 1784 when Nuzvid Zamindar Meka Apparao Naidu lost his Zamindari in Rajahmundry. Later in 1794, it was changed to Collectorate when Vogeti Apparao Naidu was given other estates to rule. Their Zamindari was considered to be one of the oldest Zamindari in Madras Presidency. these Meraka Veedhi Telagas have prominent role in history and politics. During mid-1800s in whole Rajahmundry there use to be only 1000 houses of which 64 belonged to Vogetis.  Death  He died in the year 1900 on which all the retail shop owners had closed their shops and gave condolences to the great soul.

Some comments from political websites on this major work include: > \\"It can be said that this study attempts to stare critically at the ideals > and religious values, reform and restructure them and put moral > consciousness and the ethical issue in their appropriate practical context, > by exposing them to the considerations of rights culture and private and > public freedoms, as stated in the International Covenants. The human > consciousness that has settled in our time on the centrality and > independence of the human being, linking it to the issue of power, > governance and public affairs management, to the establishment of the idea > of faith as a direct relationship with human knowledge, science, culture and > freedom, is not an inverse relationship with all that. \\" Eram News ‚ô¶ Another commentary by Riy'e-El-Youm: > \\"In his new book he works on the idea of his boss to say that the idea of > moral reform seeks to prevent the clash of religion with freedom or the > shackling of knowledge. He believes that there is no complete effort or > project for Renaissance, enlightenment and religious reform in the Arab > region and the Islamic world, in general, without engaging in the idea of > reforming the ideals and religious values, and providing scientifically > coherent theoretical and philosophical efforts regarding the nature of the > relationship between religion and morality, by building On the ideas and > efforts scattered in the Arab and Islamic heritage discussed this issue in > the past, and the approach of the moral question, but did not insist on > criticizing those ideas and efforts and dismantling, organizing, developing > and framing them in the context of the development of \\"ethics\\" in Arab > civilization based on the human common General. Mohamed Barhouma draws > attention to the fact that this was available in the golden centuries of > Islamic civilization, especially in the period between the 2nd and 5th > century Hijri, but the civilized retreat that began with the ages of > decadence prevented the crystallization of this great civilized project.\\" ‚ô¶ Another commentary by 2ooli News, about the book, quoted: > \\"This study comes at a political time when Salafist jihadist currents kidnap > the human, moral and civilized dimension of Islam, and hence the study > focuses on saying that the location of human morality in the fields of faith > and Sharia in the form provided by Salafi religious thinking and the owners > Religious ideologies can justify what is immoral in the name of religion, > when it is transformed into an ideology, and when religious texts and > teachings are interpreted in a strict manner that collide with the needs and > interests of people and their human and human gains as presented and > provided by the experiences of political Islam and Salafists In more than > one Arab or Islamic country, where the moral, human and civilized dimension > of Islam is almost in the test.\\" ‚Äì 2ooli News  Records  Other than book reviews and commentaries from known political review websites, Mohammed Barhouma earned records in article attention.

In the story, the murder of a woman named Sabrina spawns various conspiracy theories, and the book examines the impact these false narratives have on the lives of the victim's friends and family. Drnaso first came up with the idea for Sabrina in late 2014, though the graphic novel was not finished until the end of 2017. He found the project very difficult to work on and initially canceled it after being unsatisfied with the first draft. Sabrina received critical acclaim and is the first graphic novel to be longlisted for the Booker Prize. Plot summary A woman named Sabrina goes missing in Chicago, leaving behind her sister Sandra and her boyfriend Teddy. A month later, a grieving Teddy goes to stay with his childhood friend Calvin, an Air Force airman living in an isolated military base in Colorado. The recently divorced Calvin looks after Teddy, who is depressed and spends most of his time lying in bed in his underwear. A few days in, a video of Sabrina's brutal death surfaces, having been sent by her killer to various news agencies. The murderer is identified as Timmy and the police find both his and Sabrina's bodies in Timmy's house. The video spreads rapidly across the internet and becomes the focus of the 24-hour news cycle. Conspiracy theories surrounding Sabrina's murder emerge, with accusations that it is a false flag operation and that Teddy, Calvin and Sandra are crisis actors. As they try to cope with the aftermath, Calvin and Sandra are harassed by members of the public searching for the \\"truth\\", while Teddy finds himself obsessively listening to a conspiracy radio show even though it makes him miserable. The three protagonists eventually try to move on with their lives. Themes and development Although the story centers around a fictional murder, the focus of Sabrina is not on the crime itself but on the effects of the conspiracy theories that arise from it. The book serves as a commentary on the modern-day climate of \\"fake news\\". Drnaso first had the idea for the story in late 2014. The character of Calvin, an airman based in Colorado, was inspired by a friend of his. For research, he visited his friend in Colorado Springs and toured the Peterson Air Force Base. Drnaso began illustrating Sabrina at the start of 2015 and the first draft was completed by mid-2017. The final version was not finished until the end of the year. Drnaso struggled to complete the graphic novel as its themes reflected anxieties he was dealing with in his own life at the time. He was also concerned that the narrative surrounding the fictional murder was exploitative of people's grief. Drnaso initially dropped the project as he was \\"so ashamed\\" with the way the first draft turned out. He returned to it about a month later and made some changes to the book. He has since noted that the final version may not be significantly different from the original draft, explaining: \\"Maybe it was more of a mind-set where the change of heart kind of was more internal than anything I actually did to change the book.\\" One of the changes was to make Sandra's role more prominent in the story. Publication The graphic novel was first published by Drawn and Quarterly in the United States and Canada in May 2018. Sales for the novel increased following the July announcement that it had been longlisted for the 2018 Booker Prize, and a third reprint was ordered by the publisher. The book was published in the UK by Granta on June 7, 2018. The overseas rights to the novel have also been picked up by Coconino Press (Italy), Ginkgo (China), Salamandra (Spain), Presque Lune (France) and Veneta (Brazil). Reception Sabrina was very well-received by critics. GQ proclaimed it to be \\"[t]he first great work about our current age of disinformation, paranoia and fake news.\\" In his review for The Guardian, Chris Ware agreed that the novel was \\"a perspicacious and chilling analysis\\" of these contemporary issues. Ware was also unnerved by Drnaso's use of discrepancies in the narrative to \\"incriminat[e] the reader\\" by luring them to speculate over the fictional murder. NPR found the narrative to be \\"far more than just a character study,\\" becoming increasingly gripping and unsettling as it progresses. Writing for The New York Times, Ed Park called the book \\"a shattering work of art\\" and praised Drnaso's art for its attention to background detail, as well as the \\"deceptively plain\\" character designs which \\"somehow mak[e] their awful plight all the more intimate.\\" io9 concluded the book was \\"a powerful document of emotional catalog, giving a glimpse at the quietly awful imploded lives left behind by overheated sociopolitical discourse.\\" Los Angeles Review of Books noted that the book was at times \\"heavy-handed\\" in its approach to Teddy's development, but ultimately found the story to be \\"surprising, relevant, and humane.\\" Sabrina became the first graphic novel to be longlisted for the Booker Prize. Film adaptation It was announced in April 2019 that Drew Goddard will write, produce, and possibly direct a Sabrina movie for RT Features and Regency Enterprises.

The nuts are more nutritious than coconuts, and are so popular that villagers in the highlands will move their entire households closer to trees for the harvest season. Names The specific epithet \\"julianettii\\" honors naturalist Amedeo Giulianetti, who found the original type specimens. is a loanword from Tok Pisin. Sometimes the tree is called or 'karuka nut pandanus'. The term 'karuka' can apply to both Pandanus julianettii and P. brosimos, though the latter is usually called 'wild karuka'. Both species, as well as P. dubius, can be called 'pandanus nut'. In addition to P. brosimos, 'wild karuka' can also refer to P. antaresensis, P. iwen, and P. limbatus, but nuts from these trees are a much smaller part of the local diet. In contexts where multiple karuka species are discussed, P. julianettii is sometimes termed 'planted karuka'. P. julianettii, P. iwen, and P. brosimos are also in the subsection named Karuka, which is in the monotypic section also named Karuka. In New Guinea it goes by different names among each of the Papuan peoples. In the Ankave language it is . It is in the Baruya language. The Huli language word is , and it is also in the Duna language. In Kewa language it is aga, but it is unclear which dialect(s). In the Kewa pandanus language it is rumala agaa. The Kalam language term, in both standard and pandanus languages, is , but it can also be called or . The plant is called in the Wiru language. In the Pole language it's called maisene. It goes by ank in Angal language, and in the Wola dialect. The Imbongu language word is . The plant also has many names on the other half of the island. In Indonesian it is called (lit.) and (), but the latter can also refer to P. brosimos and P. iwen. The Dani people call it tuke. The Lani people call it , but this might be a separate species in the complex. Description The species was originally described by Ugolino Martelli from only a few drupes in the collections of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew He was hesitant to describe it as a new species from only that, but the characteristics were so salient he published his description. The tree is dioecious (individual plants either have male flowers or female ones), with male trees uncommon compared to females. It reaches in height, with a grey trunk of in diameter and supported by buttress roots. The trunk has white mottling and is generally smooth with occasional warts or small knobs as well as rings of leaf scars. Inside the trunk is pithy and lacking cambium. The top of the tree sometimes branches, producing three or four crowns of leaves. Each crown will produce a single cluster of nuts, typically once every other season. Production is affected by the seasonality of local rainfall. Leaves spiral up the trunk in opposite pairs. The large leathery leaves are long and wide. The apex of the leaf is attenuate and doubly-pleated, with prickles pointing up at the tip and along the margins and midrib. The leaves are dark green on top and dull cyan underneath. The inflorescence on male trees is a densely-branched spadix with a dozen long spikes, each containing many staminate phalanges. In each phalange is a column 3 mm long topped by up to 9 subsessile anthers. The male flowers are white, and the whole male flowering organ may be up to long. The pollen has a psilate exine (unornamented outer wall) 0.8 Œºm thick. The ornamentation is granular between echinae (short spines). The ulcerate aperture is 3 Œºm in diameter. Pollen grains measure an average of 30 √ó 14.5 Œºm in size. On female trees, the inflorescence is a single ellipsoid or ovoid syncarp, or fruiting head, with off-white bracts. Female flowers can produce fruit without pollination, and are typically the only trees cultivated. The tree stops making leaves when new fruit is growing. The syncarp has up to a thousand densely-packed single-celled carpels that later turn into drupes. The clavate, pentagonal drupes measure up to 12 cm long and have a sharpened base, but typically are 9√ó1.5 cm, and are a pale blue-green color. Each cluster contains about 1000 nuts. The endocarp is bony and thin, 5¬Ω cm long, with rounded edges about 1¬Ω cm wide. The seed-bearing locule is around 4 cm long. The core of the mature head (mesocarp) has an appearance like honeycomb and is spongy and pink. The top of the mesocarp is fibrous, from 3 cm long and up. Though Martelli did not have a complete syncarp, he knew the cluster of fruit must be large, estimating at least 30 cm in diameter. He was correct, as the fruiting cluster is typically 15 to 30 cm in diameter. A mature head and stalk weigh up to 16 kg, but average 6 kg. It most closely resembles P. utilissimus, which is found the Philippines. People also harvest and eat nuts of P. antaresensis, P. brosimos, P. dubius, P. iwen, and P. limbatus, and P. odoratissima Cultivars There are up to 45 cultivars of karuka, many with different kernel shapes. There are likely many more, as some are known only to a small number of people in a single settlement. 'Tabuna' and 'Henga' are some of the most important. 'Tabuna' is popular because it is high-yielding, tastes good, and has no taboos on who/what can eat it and how/if it is cooked. At least two varieties are edible raw. Named varieties include:   Goalia * Gurubu * Hagidara  Henga * Homagal-iba Honde  Kabali Kai  Kebali  Mabu   Ngaule  Padua * Pari   Tabuna  Tenyon  Tolo  Tumbi * Tumbu * It is possible a cultivar is listed more than once under different names, as Papua New Guinea has a very high linguistic diversity. Benjamin Clemens Stone posits that P. julianettii and P. brosimos are a single species with many varieties, but does not support this point. However, Simon G. Haberle notes that the pollen of the two trees are indistinguishable by light microscopy. P. iwen may also be part of the species complex. Distribution Giulianetti's type specimens were collected from Vanapa, British New Guinea (now southern Papua New Guinea). The tree can be found cultivated or wild on New Guinea, both in PNG and Papua province. Wild trees are found on the Huon Peninsula and in the highlands of New Guinea's central cordillera. In Papua New Guinea, the tree is most commonly grown in Southern Highlands, Western Highlands, Eastern Highlands, Enga, and Chimbu Provinces, and it is found in all provinces on the mainland except East Sepik. It grows in montane forests between 1,300 and 3,300 m in elevation in areas that get 2-5 m mean annual precipitation. It grows in both dry and wet soils, but prefers good soil fertility. Trees will grow in clumped groups of 5 to 10 individuals per hectare. Ecology Karuka produces fruit around February, with an occasional secondary season in July. Typically each branch will only flower every other year. The natural pollination syndrome is unknown, but the flowers can be pollinated by humans. Seed dispersal is by humans, birds, and other animals. According to the Kalam people of Madang Province, the Lorentz's mosaic-tailed rat (Paramelomys lorentzii) helps spread karuka seeds. A fallen syncarp will disintegrate completely in about 3 days in the forest. Fungal pests of karuka include leaf spot, diffuse leaf spot, black leaf mould (Lembosia pandani), sooty mold (Meliola juttingii), and fungus on seeds (Macrophoma pandani). The leaf moulds do not do much damage. The sooty mould seems to grow on insect frass. The black leaf mold only affects some varieties. The bacteria Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum can also cause bacterial soft rot and necrosis on the leaves, but causes more severe damage to the related species Pandanus conoideus. Longhorn grasshoppers (Tettigoniidae) are serious insect pests. Segestes gracilis and Segestidea montana eat the leaves and can sometimes kill trees. Growers will stuff leaves and grass in between the leaves of the crown to keep insects out. An unknown species of black grub will burrow into the cluster and eat the spongy core, causing the nuts to turn black and the whole bunch to fall off the tree. Woodboring beetles sometimes attack the prop root of the tree. Possums also eat the nuts, as do rodents such as squirrel-toothed rats (Anisomys imitator), eastern white-eared giant rats (Hyomys goliath), Rothschild's woolly rats (Mallomys rothschildi), and giant naked-tailed rats (Uromys anak). Growers will put platforms or other obstacles on the trunks of trees to keep the pests out. Harvested nuts are often beset by rats and cockroaches. Hanging nuts in the smoky areas above fires can prevent this, but after a while the taste of the nuts is affected. Use by humans On New Guinea karuka is cultivated crop, and has been used as a major food source since nearly 31,000 years ago in the Pleistocene. In PNG nearly 2 million people (almost half the rural population) live in regions where karuka is commonly eaten. There is high demand for it in the New Guinea Highlands: Entire households (including pigs, who are sometimes fed the fruits) will move from the valleys to higher elevations at harvest time, often for several weeks. Each household will average 12 to 176 trees. Trade in karuka is small- scale and not commercial. Local marketplaces typically will have 12 to 50 fruits for sale. With some coordination between state agencies and private sector, karuka could have export market access. The crop has a medium potential for large-scale sustainable commercialization in the region, but care must be taken in the sensitive local environments to expanded agriculture. Diets of tree owners could also be negatively influenced by rapid commercialization. The endosperm, a white kernel, is eaten raw, roasted, smoked, or mumued. Nuts that aren't immediately eaten are typically sun-dried for storage. The karuka kernels have a sweet, coconut taste, or savory and like walnuts. Smoked or cooked karuka is either stored in the rafters or sold at local marketplaces. The uncooked clusters can also be stored for months buried in waterlogged earth, which possibly ferments it. It is a regional staple food and one of the few plants in the area with a high protein content. The spongy core of the multiple fruit cluster can also be cooked and eaten after the nuts are removed. Oil extracted from the nuts The high fat content means the nuts can be processed into an edible yellow oil. Karuka contains 52.39% oleic acid, 44.90% palmitic acid, and 0.19% stearic acid. The oil is a good source of Vitamin E (Œ±-tocopherol 5.03 mg/100 g). The color of the oil is from the carotenoids, which are at a concentration of 2.75 ¬µg/g. The antioxidant activity for the oil is fairly low, and it is higher in saturated than unsaturated fats. Some subjective reports indicate that children are healthier after karuka season, but there may also be increased incidence of tropical ulcers and pig-bel (caused by Clostridium perfringens). But the connections, if any, are unclear. Trunks and buttress roots are used for building. The sheets of bark are used for house walls. The leaves are used for bush shelters and raincapes. The leaves were the preferred building material for housing in Papua New Guinea before colonial contact. The durable white spathe leaves on male inflorescences are used by the Wola people to wrap pearl shells. Karuka can be cultivated by cutting a mature branch and replanting it (vegetative propagation). Suckers can also be replanted. Nurseries also plant seeds directly. New nuts will grow when a tree is at least five or six years old, and can keep producing for up to fifty years. The tree can tolerate temperatures down to 3¬∞C for extended periods and 0¬∞C for short periods. The USDA hardiness is 10‚Äì12, and is hardy to zone 10 in the UK system. In Upper Karint near Pingirip, karukas are planted as boundary lines between garden plots. In culture In PNG's Central Province Premier Rugby League the team for Goilala District is called the Karukas.

The company specializes in the manufacture and repair of fiberglass sailboats. The company was founded in 1961 and continued as the North American builder of the Etchells keelboat in 2018. History Viking 28 Viking 33 Ontario Yachts was founded by Dirk Kneulman Sr. and Maria Kneulman. Dirk Kneulman Sr. was born in 1922 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where he grew up learning to build wooden boats. He immigrated to Canada in 1950 and shortly after built his first Snipe. By 1961 Kneulman was building boats, mostly kayaks and dinghies, including Snipes and 5.5 metre boats, and Sitka spruce spars, and sail battens ‚Äì all made from wood. After only a few years in the business, Ontario Yachts established a reputation for high-quality workmanship and soon Kneulman‚Äôs Snipes were sought after by North America‚Äôs top one-design racing sailors. Next, Dirk established a world-wide market for his dinghy, 6 Metre and Dragon masts. As Kneulman‚Äôs reputation as a boat builder grew, he began to build Olympic-class boats. In 1968, his penultimate year building Olympic boats, nine of his shop‚Äôs 5.5 Metre yachts raced in the Mexico Olympics. Kneulman accompanied his fleet at these Olympics as a shipwright on the shore support team to ensure his boats were properly tuned and repaired. One of these 5.5‚Äôs, owned by media magnate Ted Turner, won a world championship in 1972. Kneulman was the Canadian Olympic Sailing Team shipwright in 1972 as well. In 1975, Kneulman began to build Etchells. Kneulman went to Dwyer Boats in Barrington, Rhode Island to learn fiberglass boat construction during a one week course. During the late 1960s and on through the mid 1980s, Ontario Yachts gained a reputation as a builder of quality fiberglass production boats. The first designs produced were the Viking 22 keelboat and the Albacore dinghy. Later designs intended for the cruising market included the C&C; Yachts-designed Viking 28, Viking 33 and Ontario 32. The Bruce Kirby-designed Sonar was intended for the racing sailboat market. The company survived the early 1980s recession and the downturn in the fibreglass boat market by diversifying into other lines of fibreglass work.

Horseshoe Falls, Niagara, 1856‚Äì57, oil on two pieces of paper, 29.2 √ó 90.5 cm. Olana State Historic Site Niagara is an oil painting by Frederic Edwin Church. Niagara was his most important work to date, and confirmed his reputation as the premier American landscape painter of the time. In his history of Niagara Falls, Pierre Berton writes, \\"Of the hundreds of paintings made of Niagara, before Church and after him, this is by common consent the greatest.\\" Background The Falls were commonly painted, being such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were \\"the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American landscape painting\\".Howat, 69‚Äì72 Moreover, the public was captivated by the natural wonder of the Falls, considered a landmark of the North American landscape and a major tourist destination. It was the \\"Honeymoon Capital of the World\\", and prints of Niagara were given as wedding gifts. In the 1850s, Niagara was the subject of millions of stereographs, and its image could be found on wallpaper, china, and lampshades, among other consumer items. In 1853, a 1600-foot moving panorama of Niagara Falls was exhibited in New York City.. For Americans, the Falls symbolized the grandeur and expansionism of the United States. David C. Huntington, whose writing on Church in the 1960s revived interest in the painter, explained how Americans, in an era of spiritual optimism and manifest destiny, would have perceived such a vivid painting of Niagara, with all that it symbolized: Church studied Niagara Falls extensively leading up to 1857, making dozens of pencil and oil studies. In 1856 Church visited the Falls for probably the fifth time. His teacher Thomas Cole had also visited the Falls. A writer in Art and Artists in Connecticut (1879) reported that the painting itself took about six weeks and that Church used two similar canvases simultaneously: a \\"draft\\" upon which he tested a painting idea, and the final canvas, to which he transferred the results he found satisfactory. Description Church's painting is of Horseshoe Falls, the largest and most iconic of Niagara's three waterfalls. With a width of , it is more than twice as wide as it is high. The canvas's unusual proportions allowed him to paint a panoramic view from the Canadian side of the falls; the composition leads the eye laterally. The vantage point was dramatic and unique, leaving behind the \\"canonical banality\\" of many other paintings before it, the merely picturesque, and immersing the viewer directly in the scene, as if airborne or even in the water. The lack of a repoussoir aids this effect. Before the advent of modern photography, which made such images common, this was a revelation.Berton, 73‚Äì77 Niagara is highly naturalistic, more so than Church's previous The Andes of Ecuador (1855), and shows the influence of John Ruskin's aesthetics on Church. Church brings the viewer to the lip of the falls, highlighting the impressive drop by painting in streams of water and cloudy mists. The only foreground object is a floating tree trunk, which might be confused for a branch but for its roots, providing a sense of scale. The white foam near the trunk has some build-up of paint on a canvas that is otherwise smooth. The foam might suggest that the tree is caught on an unseen rock; there is ambiguity in whether this location is a small respite of stability or highlights the imminent danger of reaching the fall's edge.Raab, 24 Church's extensive study of the falls allowed him to capture the effect of mist and turbulent water with unprecedented realism. The light creates a partial rainbow beyond the precipice, whose arc is strong where the mist is thick, and absent elsewhere, a highly realistic rendering and a technical achievement. Distant on the horizon are a number of buildings, including Terrapin Tower, on the platform of which stands a tiny person.Raab, 25‚Äì26 The painting accumulated damage over time, requiring Church to repaint some of it in 1886. He re-worked the sky so that it was more unified with the water, \\"more subservient to the cataract\\", but felt limited in the changes he could make by the many copies of the popular Niagara that existed at that point, in engraving and chromolithography.Raab, 42‚Äì43 Exhibition and legacy Church developed Niagara with public exhibitions in mind. Between May 1 and 29, 1857, tens of thousands paid 25 cents to view the painting‚Äîwhich was greatly praised by local critics‚Äîin a darkened Manhattan gallery in which only the painting was illuminated.Avery, 21‚Äì22 Some would spend an hour in front of the painting: \\"Spectators forgot that they were looking simply at pigment ... The painting became the surrogate of a visit in person to the site.\\" Many artists, writers, and politicians reportedly visited the painting's exhibition, including Horace Greeley, Henry Ward Beecher, George Bancroft, George Ripley, Charles Anderson Dana, and Fitz James O'Brien. Over a thousand subscriptions to a planned chromolithograph were sold; $30 for an artist's proof and $15 for a print, both in color.Raab, 38‚Äì41 Harper's magazine called Niagara \\"more widely known and admired in this country than any other picture ever painted in America\\".Raab, 30 The painting was shown in England and Scotland in the summer of 1857. After a showing in London, a chromolithograph was made by Day & Son in June, followed by more exhibitions in Glasgow, Manchester, and Liverpool. London's Art-Journal wrote, \\"No work of its class has ever been more successful: it is truth, obviously and certainly. Considered as a painting, it is a production of rare merit: while admirable as a whole, its parts have been carefully considered and studied; broadly and effectively wrought, yet elaborately finished.\\"Metropolitan Museum of Art, 243‚Äì246Howat, 73‚Äì74 Famed art critic John Ruskin was impressed, as reported by Church's friend Bayard Taylor: \\"The exhibitor told me that Ruskin had just been to see it, and that he had found effects in it which he had been waiting for years to find.\\" Ruskin was said to have marvelled at the rainbow, believing at first that the play of light through a window was projected onto the canvas. In September 1858 Niagara returned to the United States, where, after another New York showing, it travelled to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Richmond, and New Orleans. Cosmopolitan Art Journal wrote, \\"The reputation of this work has greatly increased by its English tour. It is now regarded as the finest painting ever executed by any American artist.\\" Another exhibition in New York followed. Niagara was exhibited at the 1867 Exposition Universelle in Paris, where it won a silver medal and improved the European view of American art. Harper's Weekly wrote, \\"The European critics declared that the 'Niagara' gave them an entirely new and higher view both of American nature and art.Rodriguez Roque, 42 This study for Under Niagara (1862) is similar in composition to the lithograph of the lost painting. Church's composition was the first painting from the Hudson River School to be an \\"instant success\\". It was uniquely realistic and \\"without 'manner'\\", marking the beginning of a new era for Hudson River artists, such as Jasper Francis Cropsey, Martin Johnson Heade, John Frederick Kensett, Albert Bierstadt, and R√©gis Fran√ßois Gignoux. Heade especially took to Niagara, which may have influenced some of his choices in canvas size. He wrote, \\"Church's picture ... far exceeds my expectations; & I don't wonder that Ruskin, after looking at it for half an hour, could only utter 'marvelous'. I look upon it as the most wonderful picture I ever saw.\\" Niagara was sold to the New York art dealers and print sellers Williams, Stevens & Williams‚Äîwhere it was first exhibited‚Äîfor US$4,500 in 1857, including $2,000 for reproduction rights. It was acquired at auction in 1861 by the businessman John Taylor Johnston for US$5,000, and then bought at auction in 1876 by William Wilson Corcoran for his Gallery for $12,500, then a record for a painting by an American artist. When the Corcoran closed in 2014, its collection was transferred to the National Gallery of Art, also in Washington, D.C. Church made two more finished paintings of the Falls. Under Niagara (1862) is now lost, but survives in lithographs, including an overpainted lithograph at Olana. It was a 4-by-6 foot painting said to be completed in a day.Kelly, 61 The third painting, Niagara Falls, from the American Side, was made in 1867 and is the largest of Church's paintings by surface area.

Produced by Kimsi Singh and Kartikeya Narayan Singh, the film stars Geetika Vidya Ohlyan and Saloni Batra in the lead roles. It was written by Ayr and Kislay and chronicles the life of police officer Soni (Ohlyan) and her superintendent in Delhi Police Kalpana (Batra), who deal with crimes against women in the city. The idea for Soni occurred to Ayr in 2014 when he was reading that Delhi was being put under scrutiny for not being safe for women, especially after the 2012 gang rape case. Ayr read several articles and interviews about the Delhi police and was interested in woman officers' reactions to cases of sexual violence. He spent time with several Delhi police personnel and observed their daily routine. Pre-production started in November 2016 and Ayr finished the script in January 2017 and the film was shot for 24 days in Delhi in February. David Bolen served as the director of photography while Ayr and Gurvinder Singh edited the film. Soni premiered in the Orrizonti (Horizons) section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival, receiving a standing ovation. The film was also screened at the 2018 BFI London Film Festival, the 2018 MAMI Film Festival, and the Pingyao International Film Festival, where it won the Best Film award and a cash prize of $20,000, half of which went to fund development of the director's next project. The other half was provided to the film's distributor in China. Ayr received a special mention for \\"Achievement in Directing\\" for the film at the 2018 Asia Pacific Screen Awards. The film was released on 18 January 2019 on Netflix to critical acclaim with particular praise for its direction and the performances.  Plot  Soni is a police officer who, following her divorce, lives alone in Delhi. She is friends with senior superintendent Kalpana Ummat, who lives with her husband Sandeep, who is a high-ranking officer in the Delhi police. Soni's ex- husband Naveen often visits her, trying to persuade her to rekindle their relationship but she is not interested. One day, while on duty, Soni beats a street goon who tries to harass her. Kalpana reprimands Soni for her temperamental and impulsive behaviour, while also expressing concern about her safety. A day later at a check post, Soni again gets involved in an violent incident when she slaps a drunken navy officer who is driving without a licence and misbehaves with her. The commissioner of police take disciplinary action against Soni for the check post incident. Kalpana tries to persuade Sandeep and her seniors against it, but Soni is transferred to the police control room and an inquiry is set up to look into the incident. A few days later, Soni is brought back into the police after Kalpana's intercession. The two later go to a restaurant to relax. Soni goes to the ladies washroom, which has been occupied by a group of young men who are consuming drugs. She gets into a fight with them and injures her hand before they are arrested. One of the men is found to be the son of a minister's friend. After the incident, Sandeep scolds Kalpana, holding her responsible for the fight. The arrested men are released immediately, while Soni is taken off duty and sent back to the control room.  Cast  * Geetika Vidya Ohlyan as Soni * Saloni Batra as Kalpana Ummat * Vikas Shukla as Naveen * Mohit S. Chauhan as Sandeep  Production  = Development = Ivan Ayr studied screenwriting and film direction at the San Francisco Film Society and directed such short films as Lost and Found and Quest for a Different Outcome during the time. Ayr decided to make Soni in 2014 when he was reading articles reporting that Delhi had been put under the \\"spotlight of shame\\" for not being safe for women, especially after the 2012 Delhi gang rape. He felt disturbed and said he started \\"questioning my own understanding of the city\\". Ayr then read several articles and interviews about the Delhi police and found they have \\"probably the highest proportion of policewomen in the force\\" in the country. He was interested in how a female police officer would react to sexual assault. He said the film deals with gender issue; \\"The assumption is that if they are female cops they will be in a position of power, they won't be susceptible to everyday crimes that other women face\\". Ayr said that the gang rape incident prompted him to write a story, \\"may be the seed was sown then but it took time to settle in the subconscious\\". Pre-production started in November 2016; Ayr spent time with several Delhi police personnel and observed their \\"daily grind, the dynamics and hierarchies within\\". Ayr said he was motivated to write the script by observing the way female and male police officers would work and how they react to cases of crime against women. He requested senior police officials to allow him to spend time with their teams as they went about their jobs. To get a female perspective into the story, Ayr used producer Kimsi Singh as a \\"sounding board\\" from the first draft. Later on, Ayr's former screenwriting teacher Lisa Rosenberg got involved as a script consultant. He said he wanted the film to be as realistic as possible, \\"I realised that even if I‚Äôm writing it consciously, some male opinions may become dominant in the script, or I might miss out on a woman's perspective.\\" He completed the script with Kislay in January 2017. Ayr based the central character Soni on several police officers he met during the research. Ayr said he co-wrote, edited and directed the film because of the low budget. He took inspiration from Jafar Panahi's 2006 Iranian film Offside for the treatment. = Casting and filming = Ayr observed several Delhi police officers for the research. Geetika Vidya Ohlyan was studying at Delhi University and was also involved with street and stage plays. On December 30, 2015, she got a call from a senior theatre personnel who told her about an \\"amazing role\\"; this was followed by a call from a member of the directorial team who wanted her to \\"self-tape\\" an audition for the film. Ohlyan sent her tape and received a call from Ayr, who liked her audition and asked her to come in for improvised rounds, after which she was cast in the role of Soni. Saloni Batra, who had also auditioned for the role was eventually cast as superintendent Kalpana. Batra had no prior acting experience and had specialised in fashion accessories, but was drawn to the project after reading the script: \\"[I] was blown away by the depth of understanding that Ivan, being a man, had of women.\\" The actors did workshops together and worked on their body language and posture. Ohlyan said she picked Puma as a reference for her body language; \\"the stillness that the animal possesses, its incessant alertness at the back of its head\\". She felt the character had to \\"look stiff and poised, but be ready to pounce because you are always alert\\". Ayr opted for a more restrained approach for Kalpana's character to put her in direct contrast with Soni, who was shown to be fierce. Ohlyan explained Kalpana's character as somebody Soni wanted to be but had no way of being, calling her \\"very thoughtful, but also ferocious in her own way\\". Ohlyan and Batra also visited local police stations, where they spent time with female police officers and observed their mannerisms and routine. Ohlyan met the station house officer of her university for research. She observed that there were several occasions when the station officer could not go home to her family: \\"I saw how she had an entire sleeping area set up at her police station.\\" Ohlyan said that she realised the difference between the personal and the private life of a policewoman was \\"very stark\\". The supporting cast consisted mainly of non-actors or part-time actors from Delhi, which Ayr said contributed to the \\"colloquial authenticity in the film\\". The film was shot for 24 days in Delhi in February, 2017. It was mostly made using handheld cameras with a mixture of natural and artificial light sources. The scenes in the film were shot in single take as Ayr wanted to \\"stay in a particular space and time with the characters, without the intrusion of cuts.\\" The opening scene was inspired by a Delhi police programme in which a policewoman was teased while cycling and the rest of the force was monitoring her. In November 2017, Soni was selected by the Work in Progress Lab of National Film Development Corporation of India's Film Bazaar under the mentorship of French editor Jacques Comets and director Marco Mueller.  Release  Soni premiered in the Orrizonti (Horizons) section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival, receiving a standing ovation.

The film was released on 18 January 2019 on Netflix. Its first trailer was released on 25 August 2018.  Reception  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Soni has an approval rating of 83%, based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 4.57/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Baradwaj Rangan called Soni \\"a rare kind of feminist film\\" that is \\"less of a polemic, more of a quiet character study\\". Namrata Joshi of The Hindu said the film \\"cut[s] too close to the bone in its own quiet, discreet, unobtrusive yet unflinching way\\". She also wrote; \\"It's a slice of life portrayal of incipient and accepted patriarchal perversions\\". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote that the film \\"stands out by making its lead protagonists women who lead by example\\" and praised the performances of Ohlyan and Batra. Nandakumar Rammohan of The Quint called the single-shot camerawork \\"unobtrusive\\" and said it makes the audience \\"feel like a fly on the wall, quietly observing the lives of these women\\". He also wrote; \\"Soni is restrained and creates an atmosphere that might get your blood boiling but never reflects that aggression in the film itself\\". Rahul Desai of Film Companion gave a positive response and called Soni an \\"excellently acted, nuanced and unflinching mirror to our times\\". Akhil Arora of NDTV called Soni \\"by far Netflix's most nuanced and best acquisition from India yet\\". Jyoti Sharma Bawa of Hindustan Times called the film \\"an underrated gem in Netflix's grand treasure. The film deserved a better launch and more faith.\\" Poulomi Das of Arre labelled the film \\"supremely well-acted, shot, and directed\\", and said it is not \\"as much a film about gender equality as it is about the continued endurance of gender inequality in India\\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV noted that the film shows the inside of a police station \\"in a manner that mainstream Hindi cinema rarely does and draws the audience gradually into a world where the two protagonists have to fight many battles, private and public, to hold their ground without abandoning their principles\\". Ashameera Aiyappan of The New Indian Express wrote that Soni \\"doesn't offer solutions, it just lets you ponder\\". Devasheesh Pandey of CNN-News18 said the film is \\"essentially woven in realism\\" with a \\"simple and effective\\" storytelling technique. Karishma Upadhyay of Firstpost called Soni \\"without a doubt, Netflix's best Hindi film offering yet\\"; she also praised Geetika and Saloni's acting and said they \\"command your attention with their restrained yet powerful performances\\". A review carried by Indo- Asian News Service praised the film and said the director \\"captures the rhythms of Soni's life with candour and conviction and little room for self- congratulation\\". Saraswati Datar of The News Minute said the film's script \\"draws you into a slow burn drama that unfolds largely at night, and in the confines of the protagonists' homes, a police station, and the bleak streets of New Delhi\\". Priyanka Roy from The Telegraph wrote that Soni \\"hits close to home ... We are shown Soni not only battling prejudice and sexism, but also living the life of a single woman in an apathetic metropolis, her loneliness and frustration palpable\\". Siddhant Adlakha of Polygon said the film \\"frames neither fury nor empathy as hidden solutions, but as equally necessary survival mechanism, and it does so through constant, expertly timed movement, capturing confusion, volatility, and tenderness, often in the same breath\\". Tanul Thakur of The Wire wrote that Soni \\"deals with familiar motifs, but its methods are home-grown and original ... As the film dives deep into the protagonists‚Äô personal lives, we see relationships, and snatches of scenes, that have eluded Hindi cinema for long\\". Biswadeep Ghosh of National Herald called the film \\"powerful and moving\\", and said it \\"intermittently reminds us of the vicious circle of patriarchy that is omnipresent in our so-called modern society\\". Sreehari Nair of Rediff.com called Soni a \\"soft treatment of a very complex subject\\". Jai Arjun Singh said; \\"Instead of providing easy answers, Soni gives us a few vignettes from the lives of Soni and Kalpana\\". He praised the acting of Ohlyan and Batra, calling them \\"extraordinary, lived-in performances\\". Uday Bhatia of Mint wrote; \\"This is a film that lives in its details‚Äîof body language, of placement within scenes, of words that sting and disarm\\". Among the overseas reviewers, Jay Weissberg of Variety wrote; \\"An intelligent, subtle script and unobtrusively bravura camerawork are the hallmarks of this indie Indian gem about two policewomen combating harassment and gender expectations\\". J. Hurtado of Screen Anarchy said the film has \\"gripping storytelling, well-rounded believable characters, and great acting by the two leads, Geetika Vidya and Saloni Batra\\". He included it in his list of \\"14 Favorite Indian Films of 2018\\". Simran Kaur of The Strand Magazine wrote: \\"A brilliant script manages to elucidate the struggles, both personal and professional, that these women go through with great depth by shifting the film between short excerpts of each of their lives as well as their scenes together, where their connection slowly grows\\". Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"A feminist viewpoint becomes as gripping as a TV police drama\\". Writing for The Daily Dot, Eddie Strait said the film \\"invokes shades of the great Iranian directors Jafar Panahi and Asghar Farhadi, and that, \\"Ayr isn't interested in condemnation ... his film thrives on compassion\\". Elisabeth Vincentelli of The New York Times wrote: \\"Ayr does not offer any tension-releasing catharsis, making his film efficiently disquieting in its own unassuming manner\\". She also wrote that a few single-take scenes \\"extend their welcome and become plodding\\".

As a juvenile she won two of her four starts including the Listed Prix Saraca on her final start. In the following year she was ran well without winning in the early part of the year before taking the Group 2 Prix de Pomone and the Group 1 Prix Vermeille and then produced a career-best performance when running a close second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She was not as successful in 1998 when she won the Doonside Cup in Scotland and finished fourth in her second attempt at Arc de Triomphe. She had no success as a broodmare. Background Leggera was a bay mare bred with no white markings in Ireland by her owner Hildegard Focke. She was trained throughout her racing career by John Dunlop at Arundel in West Sussex. She was from the tenth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Her dam, Lady Ambassador was a speedy racemare who won four races in Ireland over sprint distances and went to produce the John Porter Stakes winner Lucido. Her dam, Gertrude Lawrence, was an unraced daughter of the successful racehorse and broodmare Sarah Siddons. Racing career =1997: two-year-old season= Leggera made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Sandown Park on 14 August in which she was ridden by Tim Sprake and started a 25/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field. After starting slowly she produced a strong late run, took the lead inside the final furlong, and won by one and a quarter lengths from the Michael Stoute-trained Alignment. On 10 September the filly started favourite for a minor race at Kempton Park Racecourse but looked short of finishing pace as she came home third behind Exclusive. In the Radley Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 25 October she stayed on strongly in the closing stages to finish third behind Ffestiniog and Amabel. On 12 November Leggera was sent to France for the Listed Prix Saraca at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse over 1600 metres. Partnered by Olivier Peslier she took the lead in the closing stages and won by half a length from Queen Catherine. =1998: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut Leggera contested the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse at Newmarket Racecourse on 3 May and finished second to the Henry Cecil-trained Midnight Line. She was then sent to Germany and ran second to Elle Danzig in the Preis der Diana on 1 June before returning to England and coming home fourth behind Catchascatchcan, Rambling Rose and Silver Rhapsody in Lancashire Oaks at Haydock Park in July. On 2 August the filly was sent to France to contest the Group 2 Prix de Pomone over 2700metres at Deauville in which she was ridden by Olivier Doleuze and started the 11/1 outsider in a six-runner field. Another Dancer, the winner of the Prix de Malleret) started favourite while the other contenders included Rambling Rose and the Prix Corrida winner Lexa. After racing in third place, Leggera took the lead 400 metres from the finish and steadily increased her advantage in the closing stages to win by five lengths. On 13 September Leggera was stepped up to Group 1 class for the first time when she was partnered by Richard Quinn) in the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and started at odds of 10/1 in an eleven-runner field. The undefeated Prix de Diane winner Zainta started the 9/10 favourite while the other runners included Winona, Bahr (Ribblesdale Stakes), Cantilever (Prix de Royaumont), Isle de France (Prix Minerve) and Cloud Castle (Nell Gwyn Stakes). Leggera was among the leaders from the start, went to the front 600 metres from the finish and stayed on strongly to win by three quarters of a length from Cloud Castle with Zainta a head away in third. Three weeks after her win in the Vermeille Leggera returned to Longchamp for Europe's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and with Quinn in the saddle, she started at odds of 15.5/1 in a fourteen-runner field. he had not been among the original entries for the race, meaning that her owner had to pay a supplementary entry fee. After racing for most of the way in fourth place she took the lead in the straight and fought off a challenge from the German challenger winner Tiger Hill, but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by the French colt Sagamix. After the race Dunlop said \\"What an improved filly! I thought it was a good run from her to win the Vermeille, but she has beaten three Derby winners today. She was only just beaten in the last 50 yards, but that is where it matters. Another day's rain might have made the difference\\". For her final run of the year, the filly was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs but ran poorly and came home twelfth of the thirteen runners behind Buck's Boy. =1999: four-year-old season= Richard Quinn rode Leggera in all four of her races in 1999. On her first run of the year the filly started favourite for the Prix Jean de Chaudenay over 2400 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 14 May but after racing in second place she faded badly in the straight and came home last of the five runners behind Public Purse. She was off the track for almost four months before returning in the Doonside Cup at Ayr Racecourse in September and was made the 6/4 favourite, with the best-fancied of her six opponents being Largesse (winner of the race in the previous year) and Carry The Flag (Rosebery Stakes). Quinn sent Leggera into the lead approaching the final furlong and she won by one and a half lengths from Carry The Flag. On 3 October Leggera ran for the second time in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She ran well without ever looking likely to win and came fourth behind Montjeu, El Condor Pasa and Croco Rouge with Tiger Hill, Daylami, Fantastic Light and Borgia finishing behind. On final appearance three weeks later she finished third to Amilynx when favourite for the Prix Royal-Oak but was disqualified as Quinn weighed in for the race half a kilo under the official weight. Dunlop paid tribute to the filly, saying \\"She's been a marvellous racehorse and always gives her all\\". Breeding record Leggera was retired from racing at the end of her third season.

The original Chinese version was published in 2004. In 2018 the English version, translated by Joel Martinsen, was published in the US by Tor Books. Plot The novel follows the experiences of a first-person protagonist, Chen, whose family was killed by a ball lightning while he was in high school. Both traumatized and inspired by that experience, he makes the investigation of ball lightning his life's work, first getting his PhD in the subject, then exploring the phenomena through both applied and theoretical research. During the research, a military technology researcher Lin Yuan who wants to turn his science into a weapon and brings him in to a weapons development research team. With the help of a theoretical physicist, Ding Yi, they recognize that ball lightning is not formed by lightning conditions, but rather when lightning encounters \\"macro-electrons\\" hypercharging the electrons until they express their energy. They learn how to capture these macro-electrons, and turn them into the a weapon which can destroy targeted types of matter; wood, stone, or even microprocessors. After building a weapon and specialized military unit to use the device, they successfully deploy the weapon against anti-technology eco-terrorists who try to blow up a nuclear plant, but kill a group of schoolchildren that had been held hostage. Disillusioned, Chen leaves the military research group. Using a technology they developed in the ball lightning research, Chen develops a strategy for tracking tornado formation. American scientists combine that technology with missiles to suppress tornado formation in the American Midwest. When war breaks out between the U.S. and China, the U.S. uses a similar application of Chen's technology to form tornadoes as a weapon to destroy naval vessels. Living daily life in wartime China, Chen is surprised to one day find that all the microprocessors in the city have been incinerated. Ding Yi finds Chen and recounts that he and Lin's research group had progressed beyond macro-electrons to find macro-nuclei as well, bringing about the possibility of creating \\"macro-fusion,\\" which would combine the power of conventional nuclear weapons with the matter-selectivity of ball lightning. The military, fearing the consequences of such technology, shut down the research, but Lin disobeys orders and starts the planned macro- fusion trial, at the cost of her own life. The reaction destroyed microprocessors across a swathe of China, and as the world recognizes the power of any future macro-fusion events to wipe out advanced weaponry across a theater of war, an armistice is signed. At the end of the novel, an American ball lightning researcher visits Chen and they discuss his latest research. The Americans had found that in several trials, ball lightning behaved as though an observer was present, despite the experiment being held deep in a mineshaft with no human observers; thus foreshadowing the Trisolarans' silent watch on humanity in Liu's Three-Body Problem novel.

It was created to address calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, among them the development of \\"culturally appropriate curricula\\" for Aboriginal Canadian students. Its content includes information about indigenous lands, languages, communities, treaties, and cultures, and topics such as the Canadian Indian residential school system, racism, and cultural appropriation. Description The Atlas consists of a four-volume book set, an interactive website, five floor maps, downloadable tile maps, plastic-coated maps, poster maps, teaching guides for elementary and secondary school students, and lesson plans for teachers. One floor map is the size of a school gymnasium. To create the Atlas, editors collaborated with a number of groups and organizations representing indigenous peoples in Canada, including the Assembly of First Nations, Indspire, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the M√©tis National Council, and the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. Some of the editors are members of an indigenous group. The four books comprising the encyclopedia are: Inuit, about the Inuit; M√©tis, about the M√©tis; First Nations, about the First Nations; and Truth and Reconciliation, about residential schools, redress, and litigation. The latter volume also includes numerous maps. The visual design was created by Vincent Design of Winnipeg, founded by M√©tis designer Shaun Vincent. The logo is a compass-shaped circular graphic representing guidance and incorporating themes from aboriginal groups throughout Canada, such as a medicine wheel. History It was unveiled in Ottawa on June 21 2018 by John G. Geiger, the chief executive officer of Royal Canadian Geographical Society, M√©lanie Joly, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Nellie Kusugak, Commissioner of Nunavut, and leaders representing First Nations, Inuit and the M√©tis Nation, as well as Indigenous artists. A subsequent launch was held in Toronto in August 2018 by Royal Canadian Geographical Society chief operating officer Gilles Gagnier, Kids Can Press president Lisa Lyons Johnston, leaders of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, and some of the editors who contributed to the atlas. The project began in 2016 with a meeting between Geiger and Carolyn Bennett, the Minister of Crown‚ÄìIndigenous Relations of the Cabinet of Canada. In June 2017, Joly announced that the Government of Canada would provide $2,084,000 in funding to the Royal Canadian Geographical Society to develop the educational resource, a portion of which was drawn from the Canada 150 fund. An issue of each of Canadian Geographic and G√©ographica were dedicated to the project. The book set will be sold and distributed by Kids Can Press. Geiger has stated that the atlas and maps will be translated into a number of the indigenous languages of Canada.

It was built soon after 1791 by Thompson Blunt, who had just married Frances Morrisette, a granddaughter of Pierre Morrisette, one of the early Huguenot settlers. This original building consisted of \\"a 1 1/2 story Huguenot-style structure with a three-bay facade and twin front doors\\". In 1831 Thompson Blunt retired to Powhatan County and left Aetna Hill and its lands to his daughter Moriah and her husband, Elijah Brummall. A large addition was made to the house around 1840, when a 2 1/2 story, side passage house adjoining the west side of the original house was completed. In 1928, the house was in the possession of a local preacher named Robert H. Winfree. How the house came into the possession of Rev. Winfree is unclear, but it might have been inherited by his wife, Maria P. Watlington Winfree. Maria was the daughter of John O. W. Watlington and Ann Maria Brummall, who was the daughter of Elijah and Moriah. Winfree was the pastor of nearby Jerusalem Baptist Church (later renamed Winfree Memorial Baptist Church, in honor of him and his father David B. Winfree, Jerusalem's first pastor), where he preached at for more than 30 years. The Midlothian and Chesterfield County historian, Bettie Woodson Weaver, also lived here with her mother, who was Robert H. Winfree's daughter, in her early years. After going to college and marrying Albert Weaver, Bettie returned to Aetna Hill after World War II and started renovated the building over the next three years, adding heating, electricity, and indoor plumbing to the 150-year-old house. The facade of the original 1791 house was altered when one of the front doors was taken off and replaced with a wide double window. Weaver lived at the house until very shortly before her death, writing and publishing 11 books and countless articles. In the present day, Aetna Hill is largely untouched and the main house appears as it did in the 1840s, with slight alterations. Its lands are one of the largest sections of still standing forests in central Midlothian.

Kerrison (born 1953) is an American historian, and professor of history at Villanova University. Her work examines the role and life of American women, with the assistance of primary sources, oral history and written biographies.  Life  Kerrison was born on September 30, 1953. She studied American history at the College of William & Mary, earning a Master of Arts degree in 1994 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1999 with the thesis By the Book: Advice and Female Behavior in the Eighteenth-Century South. She teaches women's and gender history and focuses on the colonial and revolutionary period of US history. In 2007, she was awarded the Outstanding Book Prize of the History of Education Society for her first book, Claiming the Pen: Women and Intellectual Life in the Early American South. Kerrison is the Academic Director of Gender and Women's Studies of Villanova. In 2012, she was a Virginia Foundation for the Humanities Fellow.  Writing  Kerrison's book, Claiming the Pen (2006),Claiming the Pen: Women and Intellectual Life in the Early American South. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. 2006. looks at how Anglo-American women in the American South contributed to literature and print in the 18th century. In the book, Kerrison demonstrates the types of hierarchies that women in the southern United States faced, including race, class and gender. Kerrison's attention to women writers in the South, who had been largely neglected by historians in favor of New England writers, helps fill a gap in literary studies. Kerrison used oral history and other forms of literature and writing to examine the intellectual lives of Southern women. Women in the South generally did not have as many advantages as their counterparts in New England, Kerrison argues. However, many of them found outlets through religion, especially after the Great Awakening. Kerrison says that these women tended to consider themselves inferior to the men in their lives and while they wrote, their writing did not assert their independence.

New York: Ballantine Books. 2018. was called \\"an insightful contribution to women's history\\" by Kirkus Reviews. The book follows the story of Thomas Jefferson's three daughters, two born to his white wife, and Harriet Hemings, a mixed-race child born into slavery to Sally Hemings. Harriet was seven-eighths white. Kerrison uses primary sources, oral histories, and other written biographies to reconstruct the three sisters' lives. Kerrison also examines the life of Sally Hemings, Harriet's mother. Her portrait of Jefferson is unflattering. Kerrison has also written about the history of beauty and attraction. Although she has welcomed the increased prominence of women in a variety of industries in the last 30 years, she believes \\"beauty is being constituted primarily as female\\", and it is still important for any woman in the public eye. In Jefferson's Daughters, she describes how Jefferson was very invested in preserving and creating beauty for his daughters.

Accordingly, many neofascists have taken to celebrate Hitler's birthday by eating Eiernockerl while they promote the ostensibly strictly culinary event on social media. The allegation about the dish has not been historically confirmed, though Hitler was fond of Leberkn√∂del (liver dumplings), and Eiernockerl is normally served in Austrian restaurants every day of the year.

Giles Shelley (maggio,1645 -died 1710, last name occasionally Shelly) was a pirate trader active between New York and Madagascar. History Shelley commanded the 4-gun or 6-gun vessel Nassau on supply runs between New York and the pirate trading posts of Madagascar, including Ile Ste.-Marie. He delivered goods in demand by pirates such as gunpowder and alcohol, returning with slaves as well as merchandise stolen from East India Company ships. Backed by New York merchants such as Stephen Delancey, the voyages were immensely profitable: a pipe of Madeira wine bought for ¬£19 in the American colonies sold for ¬£300 on Madagascar. Despite not engaging in direct piracy of his own, Shelley‚Äôs trips were not always safe: in 1696 pirates who had come aboard posing as merchants robbed the Nassau. His best-known voyage took place in early 1698, one that made his backers over ¬£30,000. With Delancey‚Äôs investment he made the usual trip around Africa to Madagascar and sold his cargo. For the return trip in December he took aboard over fifty pirates who wanted to retire in New England, each of which paid for their passage in captured gold. Many of the pirates had sailed under Dirk Chivers, Robert Culliford, or William Kidd. Among the pirates he carried were Otto Van Tuyl and Paul Swan. Culliford sent a treasure chest back with Shelley along with a letter addressed to the widow of one of his crew, explaining that the gold was her late husband‚Äôs share of their loot. After a brief stop at Cayenne to drop off some of the pirates, he sailed back to Cape May in early 1699. Several pirates trying to avoid authorities were put ashore there, while a sloop met the Nassau at sea and took aboard several more who wanted to avoid New York entirely. Shelly beached the Nassau to offload the rest of the pirates and crew and their treasure. Many of the transported pirates were arrested by local authorities; New Jersey Governor Jeremiah Basse personally boarded a sloop to apprehend a group of them, though New York‚Äôs Governor Bellomont later accused him of having taken bribes to let them go. While offshore Shelley wrote a letter to Delancey detailing the voyage, a letter which was seized by authorities attempting to arrest the pirates: > Giles Shelley to Mr. Delencie, or, in his absence, Mr. John Barbarie in New > York. Cape May, May 27, 1699. At St. Mary's in Madagascar I sold the goods > for muslin, calicoes, a ton of elephants' teeth and 2 or 3 cwt. of opium. I > took on board 75 passengers: 24 went ashore at Fort Dolphin, where I bought > a few negroes and some pigs of tooth and egg (sic). Most of the passengers > design for Virginia and Horekills with Andrew Graverard. I have for their > passages about 12,000 pieces of eight and about 3,000 Lyon dollars. I hear > there is no man-of-war at New York, and design to come to Sandy Hook. Capt. > Burgess arrived at St. Mary's the day I sailed, and sold his goods very > well. Signed, Giles Shelley. Bellomont had Shelley arrested and accused of piracy. Through his lawyer Edward Antill, Shelley was released on bail then cleared of all charges. Shelley went on to become a respected merchant in New York and purchased a number of properties in the state. He was married but had no children, adopting Anthill‚Äôs son after the elder Antill died. Shelley died in 1710, leaving a great deal of land and money to his adopted son as well as various friends and relatives; his widow died in 1718.

Take Godofredo Alves for example, an everyday Lisbon business man, who comes home only to discover his wife, Ludovina, on the Yellow Sofa, in the clutches of his business partner, Machado. Godofredo's world then falls apart: he throws his wife out of their house, he consults his father-in-law Neto, and he turns to his friends Carvalho and Medeiros, in the hope that they might offer him a solution. Throughout the twisting and turning of Godofredo's newly awakened emotions, he converses with Amarela, the Yellow Sofa, contemplating a series of melodramatic solutions, including taking his own life, or challenging Machado to a duel. Eventually, Godofredo's feelings reach a peak of tension: and while he experiences his own dark night of the soul, his friends come to a collective decision on his behalf, offering a bathetic release from desperate heroics. And so Godofredo returns to his humdrum life but on re-encountering his wife at the opera, they are reconciled over his inability to wind up the family clock.

Hollister served as Supreme Commander of the Ladies of the Maccabees. Early years and education Lillian Bates was born in Milford, Michigan, September 8, 1853. Her father, Phineas Bates. He was a well-to-do farmer of Oakland County, Michigan, having emigrated from New York at an early day. He was a deacon in the Baptist Church and an earnest anti-slavery man. Her father's family were all musicians. Hollister was one of a family of six children. She was the youngest but one of three brothers and three sisters, four of whom became teachers. At the age of four and a half years, she began her schoolgirl days, walking one and a half miles to the district schoolhouse. At fourteen, she left the High School and afterwards took a course in normal training. At the age of fifteen was a normal school and high school graduate. Career At fifteen she began teaching, adding to her regular work that of normal class instruction. In 1872, at the age of nineteen, she married Daniel W. Hollister. They lived on a farm until 1881. Hollister was active in Sunday-school work and served as superintendent. In 1881, she moved to Detroit, Michigan. There, she continued her musical and literary studies. She associated herself with the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). In church work, she took a leading part, acting as president of the Ladies' Aid Society of the Simpson Methodist Episcopal Church and as conference secretary of the Woman's Home Missionary Society. She was a member of the Sunday-school normal class of the Chautauqua Circle, the Deaconess Board and various philanthropic and charity societies. In the WCTU, she was for two years secretary, then vice-president and then president, in which office, for six successive years, she received the compliment of a unanimous re-election each year. In addition to her extensive local work in Detroit, she held the office of State superintendent of the Young WCTU. Her trained executive talents were manifested throughout the State in organizing new unions. As a parliamentarian, there were but few presiding officers who out- performed her in maintaining harmony and expediting the business of meetings. Lillian M. Hollister In 1893, she was elected Great Commander of the Ladies of the Maccabees. Her trained executive talents were manifested throughout the state in building up the organization and in harmonizing and unifying the work, since which time thousands of members and scores of new Hives were added. During the first eight months of her official life, she held over 200 meetings, besides keeping up the work of the office as the executive officer of the State. She was clear in her rulings and careful to see the justice of a measure from a legal standpoint. At the Biennial Review of the Supreme Hive, May, 1895, Hollister was elected Supreme Commander of the Supreme Hive. With her experience, talent and executive force her election insured the prosperity and growth of the Order. Personal life Recognizing the commanding influence of woman in advancing the interests of the church and of all humanitarian institutions, she was slow to favor woman in politics, but later became a convert to the principle of the woman suffrage movement. She had one son. Hollister died at Lilley, Michigan, August 4, 1911, and was buried at Woodmere Cemetery, Detroit, Michigan. References =Attribution= External links \\"Mrs. Lillian M.

During the Axis occupation of Greece, ELAS partisan forces began operating in the Peloponnese from 1942, and in 1943 began to establish their control over the area. To confront them, the German occupation authorities formed the Security Battalions, which took part not only in anti-guerrilla operations but also in mass reprisals against the local civilian population. With the liberation of Greece drawing near in 1944, the Security Battalions were increasingly targeted by ELAS. Following the withdrawal of German forces from the Peloponnese in September 1944, a part of the collaborationist forces in Kalamata withdrew to Meligalas, where a force of about 1,000 Battalionists gathered. There they were quickly surrounded by ELAS detachments, some 1,200 strong. After a three-day battle, the ELAS partisans broke through the fortifications and entered the town. The ELAS victory was followed by a massacre, during which prisoners and civilians were executed near a well. The number of executed people is variously estimated at between 700 and 1,100 on different counts. After news of the massacre spread, the leadership of ELAS and of its political parent group, the National Liberation Front (EAM) took steps to ensure a peaceful transition of power in most of the country, limiting reprisal occurrences. During the post-war period and following the Greek Civil War, the ruling right-wing establishment immortalized the Meligalas massacre as evidence of communist brutality, and memorialized the victims as patriotic heroes. Following the Metapolitefsi, the official support of this commemoration ceased. The massacre continues to be commemorated by the descendants and ideological sympathizers of the Security Battalions, and remains a point of reference and a rallying cry both for the far right and the left in Greece.  Political and military background  = Emergence of the Resistance in occupied Messenia = Following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, Adolf Hitler desired to quickly extricate German forces for the impending invasion of the Soviet Union. As a result, the largest portion of the occupied country, including the Peloponnese, came under Italian military control. Western Thrace and eastern Macedonia came under Bulgarian control, and various strategically important areas (notably Athens and Piraeus, Crete, and Thessaloniki with Central Macedonia) remained under German control. In the Kalamata Province, the nascent communist-led National Liberation Front (EAM) began its activity in 1942, promoting passive resistance to the unpopular confiscation of crops by the Italian military authorities, and began the first steps to form partisan troops. The first left-wing groups formed across the Peloponnese; their engagements were limited to skirmishes with the Greek Gendarmerie and the Italian Army, and by late 1942 they were almost all either destroyed or forced to evacuate to Central Greece. In April 1943, when the Peloponnese was considered \\"partisan-free\\" by the occupation authorities, the wing commander Dimitris Michas, who had previously been imprisoned by the Italians, formed a new partisan group on orders from EAM. Following his first successes, and with the arrival of reinforcements requested from the mainland, the group grew and began openly attacking Italian soldiers and their Greek informants. By June 1943, the number of Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) partisans in the Peloponnese reached about 500 men in total. Due to the lack of a central command and the difficulties of communication, they were dispersed and operated as quasi-autonomous groups. In August 1943, according to a German intelligence report, partisan activity spiked in the mountainous areas of Messenia, where 800 men under Kostas Kanellopoulos operated. In early 1943, the \\"Hellenic Army\\" (ES), formed by mostly royalist former officers, was established as a Resistance group and formed its own small armed groups, which clashed with the Italians. Initially it declared itself a politically independent and neutral force, but after forging ties with royalist networks chiefly in the area and in Athens, it shifted to an anti-EAM stance by July. The British made efforts to unify the local Resistance groups in the Peloponnese, but these failed, and in August 1943 ES clashed with ELAS, while some of its most prominent leaders, such as and possibly also Tilemachos Vrettakos, respectively sought collaboration with the Italian and German occupation authorities against ELAS. However, the apparent delay of German assistance, the losses suffered by Vrettakos' men in a clash with a German force at , and the cessation of Allied air drops to both ES and ELAS, resulted in the defeat and dissolution of the former at the hands of the latter in October. This left EAM/ELAS as the sole organized Resistance force in the Peloponnese. = German takeover and the establishment of the Security Battalions = German troops enter the formerly Italian zone, Corfu 1943 In the meantime, after the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the overall command of anti-partisan operations in the southern Peloponnese fell to the German major general Karl von Le Suire, commander of the 117th J√§ger Division, which had been moved to the area in July. In October, Le Suire was named the sole military commander in the Peloponnese. The town of Meligalas in northern Messenia, which under Italian occupation had housed a Carabinieri station, now became the seat of two German infantry companies. The Italian capitulation led to the immediate and considerable reinforcement of ELAS in morale, personnel, and materiel, and with British support ELAS forces began attacking German targets. In the mountainous districts of the Peloponnese, representatives of EAM/ELAS translated their monopoly of armed resistance into the exercise of authority, but faced difficulties with the mostly conservative and royalist local population. Peasant disaffection was further fuelled by the requirement to feed the partisans amidst conditions of malnourishment and a general disruption of the agricultural production caused by the mounting hyperinflation and by the large-scale German anti-partisan sweeps (S√§uberungen). These operations involved reprisals against the civilian population, following a July order of the commander of the LXVIII Corps, Hellmuth Felmy. In the Peloponnese, Le Suire carried these orders out with particular ruthlessness, particularly as the partisan threat mounted, resulting in the Kalavryta massacre in December. An executed civilian (1943) In 1943, the German commanders in Greece concluded that their own forces were insufficient to suppress ELAS. As a result, and in order to \\"spare German blood\\", the decision was taken to recruit the anti-communist elements of Greek society to fight EAM. Apart from the \\"Evzone Battalions\\" (ŒïœÖŒ∂œâŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±) established by the collaborationist government of Ioannis Rallis, in late 1943 independent \\"Security Battalions\\" (Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ŒëœÉœÜŒ±ŒªŒµŒØŒ±œÇ, Œ§Œë) began being raised, particularly in the Peloponnese, where the political affiliations of a large part of the population and the violent dissolution of ES provided a broad recruitment pool of anti-communists. By early 1944, five battalions were formed and placed under the overall command of Papadongonas. One of them was the Kalamata Security Battalion (Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ± ŒëœÉœÜŒ±ŒªŒµŒØŒ±œÇ ŒöŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒºœéŒΩ), based at Meligalas, which controlled the road from Kalamata to Tripolis and the entire area of the south. The Security Battalions were subordinated to the Higher SS and Police Leader in Greece, Walter Schimana, but the development of relations of trust between the individual battalion commands and the local German authorities led to them enjoying a relative freedom of movement. The Security Battalions served as garrisons in towns across the Peloponnese, but also increasingly participated in German anti-partisan operations; they chose those that would be executed among prisoners and themselves executed hostages as reprisals for partisan attacks on German targets (as happened after the execution of Major General Franz Krech by ELAS in April 1944), gaining a reputation for lack of discipline and brutality. ELAS fighters After suffering some early blows, ELAS managed to recover its influence, and from 1944 conducted constant sabotage on the supply routes used by the German army. In April 1944, ELAS for the first time attacked a town held by a German garrison at Meligalas, but the assault was beaten back. In the same month, EAM leader Georgios Siantos, following reports of indiscipline among the partisan forces in the Peloponnese, sent there Aris Velouchiotis as representative of the Political Committee of National Liberation (PEEA), EAM's newly established parallel government. Velouchiotis' task was to reorganize the 3rd ELAS Division, with a total strength of some 6,000 men. Velouchiotis quickly imposed strict discipline, managing to reverse the decline in partisan numbers and increase the number of their attacks on enemy targets. The deterioration of the military situation led Felmy to declare the Peloponnese as a combat zone in May, which allowed Le Suire to in turn declare martial law, limiting the civilian population's freedom of movement and assembly. Nevertheless, the sweeps and reprisals by the Germans and their collaborators were not enough to reverse ELAS penetration of the countryside in Messenia and neighbouring Laconia. In the area of Kalamata, where during the occupation thousands of homes were torched and about 1,500 people had been executed, the reprisals of the Security Battalions continued until late summer. In late August, while clashes between the ELAS and the Germans had decreased, those between ELAS and the Security Battalions increased steadily. = Position of the Greek collaborators = In November 1943, the Moscow Conference issued a joint \\"Statement on Atrocities\\" by the Allied leaders Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, concerning the prosecution and trial of those Germans responsible for war crimes against occupied nations. This also served as the basis for the condemnation of Axis collaborators in the occupied countries. In the spirit of this declaration, the Greek government in exile announced the revocation of Greek nationality from the members of the collaborationist governments, while PEEA issued a legal act proscribing the death penalty for high treason to those who collaborated with the occupation authorities, including the members of the Security Battalions. However, the burgeoning confrontation between EAM and the government in exile and its British backers, who at least since 1943 began to view EAM as an obstacle to their own plans for Britain's post-war role in Greece, led the British to consider the possibility of using the Security Battalions as part of the planned post-war national Greek army, or at least as a means of applying pressure and getting EAM to agree to support a national unity government. Thus, during negotiations on forming a new government, Georgios Papandreou, head of the government in exile, resisted the pressure of the PEEA delegates to publicly condemn the Security Battalions, arguing that this had already been done in the Lebanon Conference in May 1944, and in June he caused the Allied propaganda against the Security Battalions, both through the dropping of leaflets and through radio emissions, to be suspended. With the Red Army advancing in the Eastern Front and the invasion of Romania, on 23 August 1944 the German command decided to withdraw the 117th Division from the Peloponnese. Three days later the complete evacuation of German forces from mainland Greece was decided. The British desired the maintenance of the status quo until the arrival of their forces and the Papandreou government, and above all wanted to avoid German arms and equipment from falling into the hands of the partisans. On the other hand, EAM/ELAS and its supporters were eager for revenge on the remnants of the collaborationist Gendarmerie and the Security Battalions. After the German troops withdrew from the Peloponnese, the position of their former allies became highly precarious, and fears of ELAS reprisals spread. On 3 September, the military head of ELAS, Stefanos Sarafis, issued a proclamation calling upon the members of the Security Battalions to surrender with their weapons, in order to safeguard their lives. On the same day the British lieutenant general Ronald Scobie, appointed joint commander-in-chief of all Greek forces, issued an order to his deputy in Athens, the Greek lieutenant general Panagiotis Spiliotopoulos, to recommend to the Security Battalions personnel to either desert or to surrender themselves to him, with the promise that they would be treated as regular prisoners of war. This order, however, either did not apply to the Security Battalions in the Peloponnese or was in the event ignored by them. As EAM had joined the Papandreou government on 15 August, on 6 September a formal declaration of the new national unity government was issued, in which the members of the Security Battalions were designated as criminals against the fatherland, and called upon to \\"immediately abandon\\" their positions and join the Allies. At the same time, the declaration called on the Resistance forces to stop any acts of reprisal, insisting that dispensing justice was a right reserved by the state and not of \\"organizations and individuals\\", while promising that \\"the national nemesis will be implacable\\". = German withdrawal and aftermath = Men of the Security Battalions rest in the countryside (1943) During the last months of the German occupation, Walter Blume, the head of the German security police (SD) developed the so-called \\"chaos thesis\\", involving not only a thorough scorched earth policy, but also encouraging the slide of Greece into civil war and chaos. While Blume's more radical proposals concerning the elimination of the (mostly anti-communist and pro-British) pre-war political leadership were halted by more sober elements in the German leadership, as they withdrew from the Peloponnese in early September, the Germans destroyed bridges and railway lines and left weapons and ammunition to the Security Battalions, laying the groundwork for a civil war with ELAS. Based on the denunciation of the Security Battalions by the national unity government, ELAS considered the Security Battalions as enemy formations. At Pyrgos, the capital of Elis Prefecture, the commander of the local battalion, Georgios Kokkonis, announced that he placed his unit under the command of the exiled king George II and the national government. Kokkonis conducted negotiations with ELAS, trying to prevent its entry into the city before the arrival of an official government representative, while ELAS demanded the immediate disarmament of the unit. In the end, ELAS attacked on 9 September and after a bloody struggle seized the city on the next day. At Tripolis, the negotiations between Colonel Papadongonas and 3rd ELAS Division quickly broke down. As the partisans surrounded the city, mining the roads and cutting off its water supply, and their own ammunition began to run out, the Battalionists descended into panic. Some defected, but the remainder installed a regime of terror in the city: anyone even suspected of ties to the partisans was imprisoned and Papadongonas threatened to blow them up if ELAS attacked, while his men mined the city and executed people on the streets. Nevertheless, Papadongonas was able to hold out until the end of September, when he surrendered to a British unit.  Events in Messenia  At Kalamata, the Germans departed on 5 September, leaving the Gendarmerie as the sole official armed force in the city. Using representatives of the Allied Middle East Headquarters as intermediaries, ELAS approached the prefect of Messenia, Dimitrios Perrotis, proposing the disarmament of the local Security Battalions and their confinement as prisoners until the arrival of the exiled national government. After the proposal was rejected, ELAS attacked the city at dawn of 9 September. As the partisans overcame the Battalionists' resistance, large numbers of local civilians began arriving in the city to take revenge on them. About 100‚Äì120 Battalionists, under the command of 2nd Lieutenant Nikos Theofanous and Perrotis, managed to escape the city via the unguarded railway line and sought refuge at Meligalas. A strong force of Security Battalion men was already ensconced there, and was further reinforced by another 100‚Äì120 men who arrived from Kopanaki on 11 September. Consequently, the capture of Meligalas assumed a major importance for ELAS in its bid to secure its control over the Peloponnese. The archimandrite along with two British officers, went to the town to deliver a proposal for the disarmament of the Battalionists and their transfer to a secure prisoner camp until the arrival of the government, in order to secure life and property for themselves and their families, but Perrotis rejected it. Pleas by relatives of the Battalionists who arrived from nearby villages had a similar fate. = Battle of Meligalas = The Battalionists installed a heavy machine gun in the clock tower of the main church in Meligalas, Agios Ilias, and distributed the light machine guns they possessed in houses around the church and in semi-circular ramparts around the paddock of Meligalas. ELAS forces, numbering men from the 8th and 9th Regiments, launched their attack on the morning of 13 September. The attack followed a plan laid down with the participation of (nom de guerre \\"Orion\\") from the staff of the 9th ELAS Brigade: 2/9 Battalion assumed the sector between the Meligalas‚ÄìAnthousa and Meligalas‚ÄìNeochori roads, 1/9 Battalion assumed the sector northeast of Profitis Ilias height, 3/9 Battalion the northern sector up to the road towards Meropi, and 1/8 Battalion the eastern plain until the road to Skala. At the Skala heights, ELAS also positioned its sole 10.5 cm gun (lacking a gun carriage), commanded by the artillery captain Kostas Kalogeropoulos. The ELAS plan aimed at the rapid advance of 2/9 Battalion, under Captain Tasos Anastasopoulos (\\"Kolopilalas\\") from the edge of the settlement to the main square, so that the Agios Ilias fort could be attacked on two sides. The attackers, however, encountered a minefield of improvised mines (boxes with dynamite) planted by the Battalionists the previous afternoon and evening, during the negotiations with ELAS. A new plan was made, aiming at the storming of Agios Ilias by a company of 2/9 Battalion under . This new assault forced the Battalionists to dismount the heavy machine gun from the clock tower, while the attack of 1/8 Battalion forced the garrison of the railway station to retreat to the bedesten, where a number of EAM sympathizers were being held hostage. From the afternoon to nightfall, the lines of the combatants remained the same, but the losses suffered by the Battalionists led to a fall in their morale and unwillingness to continue the battle. Their commander, Major Dionysios Papadopulos, sent a delegation to request aid from Panagiotis Stoupas in nearby Gargalianoi, but the delegates abandoned their mission as soon as they left Meligalas. At noon of 14 September, a group of 30 partisans attacked by throwing German Teller mines on the barbed wire protecting Agios Ilias, but was repulsed amidst a hail of fire by the Battalionists. A squad under Basakidis managed to breach the barricades of the defenders, but left without support, they were thrown back in a counterattack led by the sergeant major Panagiotis Benos. The sight of wounded ELAS fighters, and news of a murder committed by Battalionists, heightened the hostile mood among the civilians observing the battle. On the morning of 15 September, the leaders of the Security Battalions met in council. Major Papadopoulos proposed attempting a breakthrough in the direction of Gargalianoi, but the council was abruptly interrupted when the house was hit by a mortar bomb. In addition, rumours of the breakthrough plan were spread by Perrotis' men, panicking the wounded Battalionists, but also the imprisoned EAM sympathizers. The council was terminated following a new ELAS attack on Agios Ilias, during which Basakidis' men, using hand grenades and submachine guns, managed to push the Battalionists back. From their new positions, four ELAS partisans began firing with their light machine guns into the interior of the town, while on the sector of 1/8 Battalion, Battalionists began raising white flags in surrender. A few dozen Battalionists under Major Kazakos tried to escape to the south and thence to Derveni, but suffered heavy casualties from the Reserve ELAS, the ' (Velouchiotis' personal guard), and a squad of 11th ELAS Regiment at the heights near Anthousa. = Reprisals and executions = The lawyer Vasilis Bravos, head of the ELAS court martial that ordered the executions at the well The end of the battle was followed by the invasion of Meligalas by civilians, and an unchecked plunder and massacre. According to a contemporary report preserved in the archives of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), these were inhabitants of the village of Skala, which had been torched by the German army. Among the captive Battalionists held in the bedesten, Velouchiotis‚Äîwho arrived at Meligalas shortly after the end of the battle with his personal escort‚Äîrecognized a gendarme whom he had previously arrested and then released, and ordered his execution. The first reprisal wave, tacitly encouraged by ELAS through the deliberately loose guarding of its captives, was followed by a series of organized executions. A partisan court martial was set up in the town, headed by the lawyers Vasilis Bravos and . This court summarily condemned not only the officers and other leaders of the Battalions‚Äîlists with their names had been provided by local EAM cells‚Äîbut also many others, including for reasons having more to do with personal differences rather than any crime committed. The executions took place at an abandoned well (\\"œÄŒ∑Œ≥Œ¨Œ¥Œ±\\") outside the town. According to usual practice, to avoid the executioners being recognized, the executions were carried out by an ELAS detachment from a different area, most likely a squad of 8th Regiment, whose men were from the area of Kosmas and Tsitalia in Arcadia. On 17 September, Velouchiotis moved to Kalamata, where Perrotis and other collaborationist officials were also brought. At the central square of the city, the enraged crowd broke the ranks of the ELAS militia and lynched some of the prisoners, while twelve of them were hanged from lampposts. = Casualty estimates = The cemetery of the victims of the massacre In an ELAS communique of 26 September 1944, Major General Emmanouil Mantakas reported that \\"800 Rallides [the derogatory nickname for the Battalionists, after the collaborationist PM Ioannis Rallis] were killed\\",Communique Nr. 68 of ELAS GHQ. Reproduced in a number repeated by Stefanos Sarafis in his own book on ELAS. A Red Cross report, which generally tried to be as objective as possible, stated that the number of dead \\"exceeded 1,000\\", while a year later, the team of the noted Greek coroner reported that it recovered 708 corpses from Meligalas. The post-war right-wing establishment insisted on a considerably higher tally, with estimates ranging from 1,110 to over 2,500 victims. Thus the National Radical Union politician Kosmas Antonopoulos, whose father had been executed by ELAS, wrote about 2,100 executed people at Meligalas, although he cites data for 699 people.On Antonopoulos and his research, cf. , and In contrast, authors sympathetic to EAM reduce the number of executions considerably: the most detailed account calculates 120 killed in action and 280‚Äì350 executed. Ilias Theodoropoulos, whose brother was killed in Meligalas, in his book (distributed by the \\"Society of Victims of the Meligalas Well\\") mentions from 1,500 to over 2,000 dead, and provides a list with 1,144 names (of whom 108 from Meligalas) of those killed in action and those executed by ELAS (including some of those lynched in Kalamata, such as Perrotis). Among the victims are 18 elderly, 22 women and 9 adolescents (8 boys and a girl), while all the rest‚Äîwith some exceptions where age is not mentioned‚Äîare men of fighting age.  Aftermath  The events at Meligalas and Kalamata were detrimental to EAM, whose leadership initially denied that any massacre had taken place, only to be forced to acknowledge it later and issue a condemnation. The more moderate leaders of EAM, Alexandros Svolos and Sarafis, insisted that they faithfully carried out the orders of the national unity government, and issued orders to \\"stop all executions\\". These events demonstrated the willingness of ELAS to suffer significant losses in order to gain control before the arrival of British forces, and its ability to succeed in this goal led to a shift in British policy: the British liaison officers in the Peloponnese, who until then were under orders not to get involved in events, were now directed to intervene to secure the surrender, safekeeping, and delivery of the Security Battalions' weapons to British forces, to avoid them falling in the hands of ELAS. As a result, due to the mediation of British liaisons, the Red Cross, representatives of the Papandreou government, or even the local EAM authorities, in many towns of Central Greece and the Peloponnese the Security Battalions surrendered without resistance or bloodshed. There were nevertheless several cases where Battalionists, having surrendered, were killed, either by ELAS partisans, or by civilian mobs and relatives of Battalionist victims, as at Pylos or in some places in northern Greece. This was mainly the result of the widespread desire for vengeance among the population, but some cases involved the co-operation or even instigation of EAM cadres. The social polarization between EAM and its opponents, both Liberal and nationalist anti-communists, resulted in the adoption of a sort of double speak. EAM proclaimed that it supported order and the restoration of government authority, while at the same time launching a large-scale bloody extrajudicial purge, in order to secure its political domination before the arrival of the British forces, improve its negotiating position within the government, and satisfy the popular demand for revenge, so as to then demonstrate self-restraint and respect before the law. EAM's rivals on the other hand guaranteed its participation in the government while simultaneously trying to preserve the lives of the collaborationists. In general, however, in the power vacuum in the wake of the German withdrawal, the EAM/ELAS officials who assumed control tried to impose order, preventing rioting and looting, and resisting calls for revenge by the populace. According to Mark Mazower, \\"ELAS rule was as orderly as was to be expected in the extraordinary circumstances that prevailed. Passions ran high, and intense suspicions were mingled with euphoria\\". Furthermore, EAM/ELAS was not a monolithic or tightly controlled organization, and its representatives displayed a variety of behaviour; as British observers noted, in some areas ELAS maintained order \\"fairly and impartially\\", while abusing their power in others. When British forces landed in the Peloponnese, they found the National Civil Guard, created by EAM in late summer to assume policing duties from the partisans and replace the discredited collaborationist Gendarmerie, maintained control and order. In Patras, for example, joint patrols of British soldiers and Civil Guard men were carried out until November 1944. Reprisals were also a common phenomenon in other European countries that suffered under Nazi occupation, from the mass expulsion of the Germans in eastern Europe to mass executions of collaborationists: over 10,000 in France, and between 12,000 and 20,000 in Italy. On 26 September 1944, the Caserta Agreement was signed by Papandreou, EDES leader Napoleon Zervas, Sarafis on behalf of ELAS, and Scobie. The agreement placed ELAS and EDES under Scobie's overall command, and designated the Security Battalions as \\"instruments of the enemy\\", ordering that they were to be treated as hostile forces if they did not surrender. After the agreement was signed, Scobie ordered his officers to intervene in order to protect the Battalionists, disarming them and confining them under guard. Following the Liberation of Greece in October 1944, in some occasions the families of Meligalas victims received pensions based on the collaborationist government's law 927/1943 on military and civil officials murdered \\"by anarchist elements\\" during the execution of their duties, a law which was retained by the post-war governments.  Commemoration  Since September 1945, an annual memorial service for the victims has taken place. It is organized by the local authorities and has official representation, including government members during the Greek military junta. The Meligalas events were utilized politically and ideologically. The right-wing establishment after the Greek Civil War represented Meligalas as a symbol of \\"communist barbarity\\", while the Battalionists were commemorated exclusively as opponents or victims of the communists, since the post-war Greek state drew its legitimacy not from the collaborationist government, but from the government in exile. In newspaper announcements for the annual service and the speeches held there, every mention of the victims' membership in the Security Battalions was omitted; instead, they were referred to as \\"murdered ethnikofrones [national-minded persons]\\" or \\"patriots\\". In 1982, following the electoral victory of the socialist PASOK the previous year, the Ministry of the Interior declared that these commemorations were promoting intolerance and for 40 years had been promoting division, and decided the cessation of official authorities' attendance at the memorial service. Its organization henceforth was undertaken by the \\"Society of Victims of the Meligalas Well\\" (Œ£œçŒªŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ ŒòœÖŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ Œ†Œ∑Œ≥Œ¨Œ¥Œ±œÇ ŒúŒµŒªŒπŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒ¨), established in 1980. The relative marginalization of the memorial service was accompanied by the transformation of the speeches from celebratory to apologetic for the victims' role in the Security Battalions. In recent times, the service is attended by relatives of the victims and by far-right or even neo-Nazi groupings such as Golden Dawn. A 2011 graffiti of the \\"EAM-ELAS-Meligalas\\" slogan at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In the early 1980s, the Meligalas events became a point of reference in confrontations between university students close to the and the Leftist Clusters on the one side and the right-wing ONNED youth organization and its student wing, DAP-NDFK. After the PASOK government officially recognized EAM's contribution in the Greek Resistance in 1982, \\"Rigas Feraios\\" members coined the slogan \\"EAM-ELAS-Meligalas\\" (\\"ŒïŒëŒú-ŒïŒõŒëŒ£-ŒúŒµŒªŒπŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒ¨œÇ\\") as a counter to the positive portrayal of the Battalionists by the right-wing groups. The slogan remained current in the university students' conference of 1992, following Civil War-era and anti-communist slogans used by DAP. In the late 2000s, when the political slogans and rhetoric of the 1940s increasingly resurfaced in Greek political discourse, and with Golden Dawn's entry into the Greek Parliament in 2012, the Meligalas events were re-evaluated in a positive light by the Greek left as an example of militant anti-fascist action. Reference to them is now commonly combined with typically anti-authoritarian slogans.

Sponsored by the Committee for the Future, \\"the original space advocacy organization in the NASA era,\\" Harvest Moon would have used a leftover Saturn rocket and lunar module to conduct experiments on the Moon, paid for by the sale of lunar materials retrieved from the Moon's surface. The Committee for the Future was founded and propelled by Barbara Marx Hubbard, daughter of wealthy toy manufacturer Louis Marx. Hubbard received support from retired military officers, former NASA employees, and prominent industrialists. On May 11, 1972, Rep. Olin Teague (D-Tex) offered a Resolution in support, but the project was terminated that summer following cogent objections from NASA. Committee for the Future The Committee for the Future was founded in 1970 by Barbara Marx Hubbard, its organizing director and prime mover, with headquarters in Lakeville, Connecticut. Her father, Louis Marx, provided advice to the committee and some funding. Other prominent members included its Chairman, Gen. Joseph S. Bleymaier, USAF-ret.; Executive Director John J. Whiteside, USAF-ret.; Richard Nolte, President, Thiokol; Dr. Harold W. Ritchey, Board Chairman, Thiokol; George Van Valkenburg, producer of the documentary, The Log of Apollo 7; diamond expert Ronald Winston; and John F. Yardley, Vice President of McDonnell Douglas. According to Whiteside, the committee's goals were \\"to develop within ten years a lunar community open to people of all nations as the next step in developing the solar system for man. At the same time to apply the most advanced systems and knowledge to overall earth problems.\\" Harvest Moon was an outgrowth of these objectives. Mission The mission of Harvest Moon was to use leftover Saturn rockets and lunar modules from the Apollo program's space flights to fly two astronauts to the Moon, where they would set up automated experiments that could be controlled from Earth, collect one to four hundred pounds of lunar rocks, and return to Earth, where the collected material would be divided into tiny fragments and sold to the public. The cost to investors was estimated by the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette to be $150‚Äì$250 million, but income could reach $400 million. Profits would go to charity. The mission would be controlled by NASA. In addition to the acquisition of lunar material, two experiments were proposed. The first, with an eventual Moon colony in mind, was a twenty-foot mylar dome under which plants, insects, and possibly small animals would be observed for their reaction to the two-week-long lunar day. The second experiment would be a lunar observatory which would provide remote-controlled fourteen-day exposures through the negligible lunar atmosphere. The privately funded International Lunar Observatory, to be launched in 2019, is a modern realization of the Harvest Moon proposal.E.g. The advantages of a Moon observatory had been discussed at the beginning of the space age by Willy Ley. Project history Suggested by George Van Valkenburg in October 1970, Project Harvest Moon was developed by the New Worlds Company, incorporated by the Committee for the Future in 1970. After the financial analysis by the brokerage firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the project was publicized in the summer of 1971 and reviewed by independent newspapers and syndicated columnists such as Bob Considine. On March 9, 1972, the Project received a hearing by the House Subcommittee on Manned Flight, chaired by Rep. Olin Teague (D-Tex), a vocal supporter, who submitted a House Resolution instructing NASA to \\"reserve a Saturn 5 rocket, a command service module, and a lunar module for possible use by a transnational mission\\".United States. Cong. House. Res. 979. May 11, 1972. On July 18, however, a spokesman from NASA, which had remained lukewarm to the project, reported that there were no serviceable lunar modules. Having terminated Harvest Moon, the Committee for the Future moved on to other space proposals.

Bloss married Eunice Storer in 1881. In 1883 the couple purchased 40 acres of land, adding another 65 acres over the next ten years. In 1893, the Blosses sold an apiary of 400 hives, and used the profits to build this elaborate house in their property, using lumber harvested from the surrounding woods. Bloss later switched to farming sugar beets. In later years, the farm prospered and continued to be held by the Bloss family, becoming a cattle and dairy operation. Description The Frank D. Bloss and Sons Farm House is a two-and-one-half- story irregularly massed frame structure, quite sophisticated for a rural farmhouse. It is topped by a multiple gable roof with a gable dormer. The house has a wide variety of windows, including rounded arch and diamond shaped openings and sash widows with small, colored panes enframing a larger pane.
