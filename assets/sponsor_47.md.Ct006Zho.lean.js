The Pianet was a variant of his earlier reed-based Hohner electric piano, the Cembalet, which, like the Pianet, was intended for home use. Hohner offered both keyboards in their range until 1968. The Pianet production consisted of two distinctly different mechanism groups with characteristically different sound. The first group, lasting from introduction to 1977, had ground stainless steel reeds, a pick-up using variable capacitance, and leather-faced activation pads. The second group from 1977 until the end of production used rolled spring-steel reeds, electro-magnetic pick-ups, and moulded silicone rubber activation pads. Features The Hohner Pianet is an electro- mechanical instrument, and needs to be connected to an amplifier to produce an audible sound. It had 61 keys ranging from F1 - F6 (43.6 Hz ‚Äì 1396.9 Hz). Later models had 60 keys, missing the top F. Each key is a single lever element pivoted on a fulcrum point with a spring to return it to the rest position. The key is extended at the rear so that a pad can be mounted over a tuned spring steel reed. This pad adheres to the reed when at rest, and lifts and releases the reed causing it to vibrate when the key is depressed. The vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal by a pick-up. The resulting sound has a complex mixture of harmonics when the reed is first struck, which later reduces to a cleaner sustained tone. Early Pianets feature a knee lever volume control. The early 1960s Pianets (Pianet, Pianet C, Pianet CH, and Pianet N) featured lids which opened in an upright 'V' to form a music stand. This feature was introduced on Cembalets and became common to both instruments. The C and N models were equipped with a vibrato circuit operated by a switch mounted next to the keyboard. The N models used a variable- resistance volume pedal cabled to a socket on the rear of the keyboard. History =1960s= The Pianet evolved from the earlier Cembalet, introduced in 1958. Both instruments were designed by Ernst Zacharias. Zacharias became interested in keyboard instruments such as the clavichord, harpsichord and organ as a teenager, and studied electrical engineering at the University of Kiel. He began working for Hohner in 1954 after meeting designer Siegfried Mager. Hohner Combo Pianet sold from 1972 onward. The Pianet evolved through a number of model changes. These included both self-amplified versions and versions that required the use of an external amplifier and speaker. The most popular model, the Pianet N (denoting \\"natural wood finish\\"), evolved through two different specifications. The N had side-mounted ‚Äòinverted-V‚Äô legs, and could be equipped with an optional 12-watt valve amplifier, the Amplifier CP, which mounted below the unit in front of the player's knees. The Pianet soon found popularity with music groups of the 1960s, including the Beatles, the Zombies and Manfred Mann. This led to Hohner to producing the Combo Pianet model in 1972. It was designed for the performing musician, without legs, and intended to be placed on top of another instrument. =1970s= Hohner Pianet T In 1977, Hohner began producing the second group of models and ceased production of the Pianet N and Combo Pianet. The second group had two models, the Pianet T and M, and a hybrid version combined with a Clavinet, the Pianet/Clavinet Duo. These featured a change in design from electrostatic pick-ups and leather and foam pads to electromagnetic pick-ups (like the Rhodes piano) and silicone rubber pads. The reeds were also changed from the ground finish of the earlier type to a smooth milled finish, making them incompatible with earlier models. The new range of Pianets had a mellower sound than earlier models. While it could not lend it itself well to rock music, it was aligned more with musical tastes of the time, such as the sound of a Rhodes through a chorus pedal. It was advertised as being practical and portable, but this was misleading as it did not have an inbuilt amplifier or speakers. The M model, designed for home use, was built with a wooden veneer console case with internal speakers, while the T model was vinyl covered and designed for live performance. Subsequently, Hohner produced the Pianet/Clavinet Duo model which combined a Hohner Clavinet (essentially an electric clavichord) with the Pianet T in one instrument, with an integrated preamp that allowed the player to combine the two sounds. Production ceased around 1983. Models During the production life of the Pianet the case, mechanical features and electronics changed to keep pace with developments in electronics manufacture, reductions in manufacturing costs, and fashion. Changes to the Pianet coordinated with Cembalet production changes from the C models onward. Dating the manufacturing envelope and availability of the various Pianet models is confused by undated sales literature and differing sales availability of models between Europe and the United States. =Pianet= Approximate manufacturing span 1962‚Äì1963 The Pianet has a case side profile with a taper towards the front.

Users Early Pianets were used on a number of hit recordings from the 1960s and 1970s, including \\"She's Not There\\" by The Zombies; \\"Louie Louie\\" by The Kingsmen; \\"I Am the Walrus\\", \\"Getting Better\\", \\"The Night Before\\", \\"Tell Me What You See\\", \\"You Like Me Too Much\\" by The Beatles; \\"This Guy's in Love With You\\" by Herb Alpert; \\"These Eyes\\" by The Guess Who; and \\"Joy to the World\\" by Three Dog Night. In the glam rock era, the Pianet was used by Bryan Ferry on the first few Roxy Music albums, for instance featuring prominently in their hit Editions of You. It was a staple of the \\"classic lineup\\" sound of Curved Air (1970‚Äì1972), featuring prominently on their first 3 albums, played by both guitarist/keyboardist Francis Monkman and violinist Darryl Way. The 1972‚Äì74 lineup of progressive rock pioneers King Crimson used a pair of Pianets in live performance, played both by the group's violinist David Cross, and the guitarist, Robert Fripp. Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks used the Pianet prominently in the group's early career, as a lead instrument through a homemade fuzz box. Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie was a noted proponent of the Pianet N and Combo Pianet from the first group of products. In an article written by Bob Doerschuk in the October 1980 issue of Contemporary Keyboard she outlined why she preferred the sound of the 1960s Pianets and why she eventually replaced them. The Pianet is enjoying a renaissance (e.g. Bugge Wesseltoft's Change) due to its unique sound and the availability of new pads for the earlier models, most of which had been reduced to unplayability due to pad decay. It is also popular as a substitute for the Wurlitzer electric piano, which has a related reed-based mechanism for generating sound but is typically much heavier, requires more maintenance than the Pianet, and is overall more expensive. Restoration issues For two decades in the 1980s and 90s replacement parts for Pianets became progressively harder to find because they were no longer being supported by Hohner. The principal problem was the activation pads for the first group of Pianets, the 1960s instruments. Urethane foam was used as the damper behind the leather surface of the pad. The urethane decomposed with age, making the pads unusable. Hohner intended the pads to be a service-replaceable item (like the strings of a guitar). Restorers and players who wanted to keep a Pianet working were obliged to manufacture their own pads. The second group of Pianets, the T and M, used silicone rubber for their pads. They have aged extremely well and are still functional in most keyboards, as of 2012. The silicone pads of the T & M are not suitable for the 1960s Pianets. Their adhesion properties don't suit the ground reeds of the first group of instruments, and they produce a static discharge that is amplified by the capacitive pick-up of the instrument. In the 2000s, a number of businesses took up the servicing and maintenance of vintage keyboards, so pads suitable for both groups of Pianets are now available. The mechanical structure of keys, pivot rail, reeds, reed bar and pick-up are the same in the 1960s Pianets from the \\"Mk.1\\" and C to the Combo, so spares to get a Pianet working can come from most models. While the electronics differ from model to model, they can be exchanged if the aim is to make a keyboard playable rather than to restore it.

Early life and military career Born in Glasgow on 30 September 1828, Knox joined the British Army at the age of 14. He was under-age, but was unusually tall, he was promoted to corporal before reaching the age of 18. Crimean War By the time of the Crimean War he was serjeant in the Scots Fusilier Guards (now called simply the Scots Guards). The British and French forces began to land on the Crimean Peninsula on 14 September 1854. On 19 September the combined forces moved off toward Sebastopol and on 20 September came the first major engagement of the campaign, the Battle of the Alma.Small, pp. 43‚Äì44, 46. The Scots Fusilier Guards were part of the 1st Division, brigaded with 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards and 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, the division's other brigade was the Highland Brigade. The division was at the extreme left of the Allied line (furthest inland), and initially in reserve to the Light Division.Small, p. 47. The two divisions halted a short distance before the Alma River, the Russians having taken up defensive positions just the other side of river. Here, on the further side of the river the British troops faced first fording the river itself, climbing the bank on its far side, then after a small amount of level ground, a further relatively low, but steep bank, and then a gradual upward slope, at the top of which the Russians had built an earthworks armed with artillery.Small, pp. 44, 47. The British contingents were ordered forward at about 14:45, the French having managed to force a crossing further downstream, near the river's mouth.Small, pp. 48‚Äì49. The Light Division crossed first, but were thrown into confusion by the Russian artillery, and began to withdraw. The Guards' Brigade was ordered forward, and crossed the river. The battalions began re- establishing their ranks on the other side having scrambled up both of the banks on that side of the river. The brigadier ordered them forward without delay, and the Scots, in the middle of the Guards' line obeyed. They began their advance, but the retreating troops of the Light Division broke their line, and some of the Scots Guards joined the retreat. Officers and others, prominent among them Knox, regained control, and rallied much of the battalion. It was this action which was the first of those for which he was eventually awarded the VC.Small, pp. 50‚Äì53. Four other Scots Guards were also to be awarded the VC for their actions that day. In a letter to his family, he described the battle: He was commissioned (without purchase) into the 93rd Regiment of Foot as an ensign on 27 February 1855. On 20 April 1855 he was transferred to the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) as a lieutenant, and his original commission was backdated to 5 November 1854. On 18 June 1855, Knox volunteered for the ladder party in the attack on the Redan, an attempt to finish the Siege of Sevastopol, he was struck by a Russian cannonball, removing part of his left arm. His actions that day also contributed toward his receiving the VC. His Crimea Medal shows that he also fought at the Battle of Balaclava and the Battle of Inkerman. The Storming of the Great Redoubt at the Alma by R. C. Woodville. On 29 January 1856 Queen Victoria signed the warrant creating the Victoria Cross with the intention of rewarding acts of valour in the Crimean War. Knox's own VC was not gazetted until 24 February 1857, by which time he had already been made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur by an Imperial decree of 16 June 1856. His VC citation read: When serving as a Serjeant in the Scots Fusilier Guards, Lieutenant Knox was conspicuous for his exertions in reforming the ranks of the Guards at the Battle of the Alma. Subsequently, when in the Rifle Brigade, he volunteered for the ladder-party in the attack on the Redan, on 18 June, and (in the words of Captain Blackett, under whose command he was) behaved admirably, remaining on the field until twice wounded. He was among the 62 men at the first presentation of the VC, made by Queen Victoria in Hyde Park, London on 26 June 1857. His action at the Alma was the earliest for which a VC was awarded to a member of the British Army‚Äîearlier actions leading to the award of a VC were carried out by members of the Royal Navy. Later life Despite the loss of his arm, he continued to serve, and was appointed an Instructor of Musketry on 7 January 1858, and promoted captain on 30 April. On 15 June 1866 he was appointed Inspector of Musketry for the South Western District. He briefly returned to regimental duties from 22 January 1872, and on his retirement from the army on 8 June 1872 was granted a brevet majority. He took up residence at Cheltenham where he died on 8 January 1897, and was buried in the town's cemetery where three other VC recipients also lie. Sale of medals In March 2010 it was announced that his VC is to be sold at auction in May by medal and coin specialists Spink's, with an estimated price of ¬£100,000‚Äì120,000. His VC was sold along with his Crimean War campaign medals, insignia of the L√©gion d'honneur, and the Russian cannonball which caused the partial loss of his left arm at the Redan. No details of the current owner have been given. The sale took place on 22 April 2010 with the medal and the cannonball being sold for ¬£252,000 ($387,500) to an anonymous buyer.

The other two were George Stuart White and Robert Henry Cain. White served in the Second Anglo- Afghan War and Cain served in the Second World War. Early years Johnston was born at Laputa, near the townland of Clyhore (or Cloughore), between Ballyshannon and Belleek in the south of County Donegal in Ulster. He was the son of Robert Johnston, who served as a Q.C. in County Donegal. He was educated at King William's College on the Isle of Man.

He played in three of the four tests against South Africa.www.lionsrugby.com Military career When the British Lions tour ended, Johnston, together with Thomas Crean, decided to stay on in South Africa. He played rugby for Transvaal and captained them in the Currie Cup. In 1899, at the start of the Second Boer War, again with Crean, he enlisted in the Imperial Light Horse and Johnston subsequently reached the rank of major. Johnston was already an experienced soldier, having previously served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers between 1890 and 1894. He served in South Africa between 1899 and 1901 and was dangerously wounded during the Siege of Ladysmith. In October 1899, according to the Irish Times, the Imperial Light Horse particularly distinguished themselves in the Battle of Elandslaagte and it was during this engagement that Johnston, while still a captain, won his VC. The joint citation for him and Captain Charles Herbert Mullins reads: Johnston was badly wounded and was nursed back to health by Crean. He travelled to London in early 1901, and both he and Mullins received the VC from King Edward during an investiture at Marlborough House 25 July 1901. Johnston was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with clasps Elandslaagte and Defence of Ladysmith and the King's South Africa Medal with clasps South Africa 1901 and South Africa 1902 for his service in South Africa.http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/ffboer.htmhttp://www.victoriacross.org.uk/pujohnsr.htm The location of his medals is unknown.A Victoria Cross is displayed at the Light Horse Bar at The Saturday Club in Kolkata, India but this is not confirmed to be either a genuine Victoria Cross or that it was awarded to Johnston.

It relates to the practice of modern nation states and their regulation of their subjects through \\"an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the control of populations\\".Michel Foucault The History of Sexuality Vol. 1 p. 140 (1976) Foucault first used the term in his lecture courses at the Coll√®ge de France,Michel Foucault: Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Coll√®ge de France 1977-1978 pp. 1-4; see notes on p. 24, notes 1-4 (2007)Michel Foucault: Society Must Be Defended Lectures at the Coll√®ge de France 1975-1976 p. 243 (2003) but the term first appeared in print in The Will to Knowledge, Foucault's first volume of The History of Sexuality.Michel Foucault, (1998) The History of Sexuality Vol. 1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin In Foucault's work, it has been used to refer to practices of public health, regulation of heredity, and risk regulation, among many other regulatory mechanisms often linked less directly with literal physical health. It is closely related to a term he uses much less frequently, but which subsequent thinkers have taken up independently, biopolitics, which aligns more closely with the examination of the strategies and mechanisms through which human life processes are managed under regimes of authority over knowledge, power, and the processes of subjectivation.  Foucault's conception  For Foucault, biopower is a technology of power for managing humans in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations. It refers to the control of human bodies through an anatomo-politics of the human body and biopolitics of the population through societal Disciplinary institutions. Initially imposed from outside, whose source remains elusive to further investigation both by the social sciences and the humanities, and in fact, you could argue will remain elusive as long as both disciplines use their current research methods. Modern power, according to Foucault's analysis, becomes encoded into social practices as well as human behavior, as the human subject gradually acquiesces to subtle regulations and expectations of the social order. It is an integral feature and essential to the workings of‚Äîand makes possible the emergence of‚Äîthe modern nation state, capitalism, etc. Biopower is literally having power over bodies; it is \\"an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations\\".Michel Foucault The History of Sexuality Vol. 1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin. p. 140 (1998) Foucault elaborates further in his lecture courses on biopower entitled Security, Territory, Population delivered at the Coll√®ge de France between January and April 1978: It relates to governmental concerns of fostering the life of the population, \\"an anatomo- politics of the human body a global mass that is affected by overall characteristics specific to life, like birth, death, production, illness, and so on.Nature Vol 490 p. 309, 2012 It produces a generalized disciplinary societySecurity, Territory, Population pp. 377-378, 2007 and regulatory controls through biopolitics of the population\\".Security, Territory, Population p., 378 2007Security, Territory, Population‚Äô‚Äô, see also note 71, p. 397 2007The History Of Sexuality Vol 1 p. 139 1976 In his lecture Society Must Be Defended, Foucault examines biopolitical state racism, and its accomplished rationale of myth-making and narrative. Here he states the fundamental difference between biopoliticsSecurity, Territory, Population pp. 363-91 2007 and discipline: Foucault argues that the previous Greco-Roman, Medieval rule of the Roman emperor, the Divine right of kings, Absolute monarchy and the popesSecurity, Territory, Population pp. 363-401 2007 model of power and social control over the body was an individualising mode based on a singular individual, primarily the king, Holy Roman emperor, pope and Roman emperor. However, after the emergence of the medieval metaphor body politic which meant society as a whole with the ruler, in this case the king, as the head of society with the so-called Estates of the realm and the Medieval Roman Catholic Church next to the monarch with the majority of the peasant population or feudal serfs at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid. This meaning of the metaphor was then codified into medieval law for the offense of high treason and if found guilty the sentence of Hanged, drawn and quartered was carried out.A declaration which offences shall be adjudged treason (25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2) 1351 \\"When a man does compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his Queen, or their eldest son and heir.\\"For an excellent account of this legislation see John Barrell Imagining The King's Death Figurative Treason, Fantasies of Regicide, 1793-1796 (2000) However, this was drastically altered in 18th century Europe with the advent and realignment of modern political power as opposed to the ancient world and Medieval version of political power. The mass democracy of the Liberal western world and the voting franchise was added to the mass population; liberal democracy and Political parties; universal adult suffrage-exclusively male at this time, then extended to women in Europe from 1906 (Finland) - 1971 (Switzerland, see Women's suffrage in Switzerland), and extending to people of African descent in America with the abolition of the infamous Jim Crow laws in 1964 (see Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965). The emergence of the human sciences and its subsequent direction, during the 16th and 18th centuries, primarily aimed at the modern Western man and the society he inhabits, aided the development of Disciplinary institutionSecurity, Territory, Population p. 16 2007Security, Territory, Population pp. 55-86 2007Security, Territory, Population pp. 1-27, 2007 and furthermore, Foucault cites the human sciences, particularly the medical sciences, led to the advent of anatomo-politics of the human body, a biopolitics and bio-history of man.Michel Foucault Bio- history and Biopolitics Foucault Studies, No. 18, pp. 128‚Äê130, October 2014 Originally published in Le Monde October 1976 which was written as a review essay in response to Arthur Jensen overt racism and Foucault's great friend Jacques Ruffi√© response to Jensen's racist viewpoint, De la biologie √† la culture [From biology to culture] A transition occurred through forcible removal of various European monarchs into a \\"scientific\\" state apparatus and the radical overhaul of judiciary practices coupled with the reinvention and division of those who were to be punished.Security, Territory, Population pp. 163-90 2007 A second mode for seizure of power was developed as a type of power that was stochastic and \\"massifying\\" rather than \\"individualizing\\". By \\"massifying\\" Foucault means transforming into a population (\\"population state\\"),Security, Territory, Population pp.55-86 2007 with an extra added impetus of a governing mechanism in the form of a scientific machinery and apparatus. This scientific mechanism which we now know as the State \\"governs less\\" of the population and concentrates more on administrating external devices. Foucault then reminds us that this anatomo-biopoltics of the body (and human life) and the population correlates with the new founded knowledge of sciences and the 'new' politics of modern society, masquerading as liberal democracy, where life (biological life) itself became not only a deliberate political strategy but an economic, political and scientific problem, both for the mathematical sciences and the biological sciences‚Äìcoupled together with the nation state.Security, Territory, Population 2007 Foucault argues that nation states, police, government, legal practices, human sciences and medical institutions have their own rationale, cause and effects, strategies, technologies, mechanisms and codes and have managed successfully in the past to obscure their workings by hiding behind observation and scrutiny. Foucault insists social institutions such as governments, laws, religion, politics, social administration, monetary institutions, military institutions cannot have the same rigorous practices and procedure with claims to independent knowledge like those of the human and 'hard' sciences, such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, genetics, and biology.Serge Lang Challenges pp. 1-222 See Chapter Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case (Serge Lang refers to his dispute with Samuel P. Huntington at the National Academy of Sciences) (1998) Foucault sees these differences in techniques as nothing more than \\"behaviour control technologies\\", and modern biopower as nothing more than a series of webs and networks working its way around the societal body. However, Foucault argues the exercise of power in the service of maximizing life carries a dark underside. When the state is invested in protecting the life of the population, when the stakes are life itself, anything can be justified. Groups identified as the threat to the existence of the life of the nation or of humanity can be eradicated with impunity.  Milieu int√©rieur  Foucault concentrates his attention on what he calls the major political and social project, namely the Milieu (the environment within). How did the project milieu become interwoven into the political and social relations of men? Foucault takes as his starting point the 16th century right up until the 18th century, with the milieu culminating into the founding disciplines of science, mathematics,Security, Territory, Population p. 296 p. 308 Note 14 2007 political economy and statistics.Security, Territory, Population pp. 29-49 2007Security, Territory, Population, pp. 55-86 2007 Foucault makes an explicit point on the value of secrecy of government (arcana imperii, from the Latin which means secrecy of power, secrets of the empire, which goes back to the time of the Roman empire in the age of Tacitus) coined by Jean Bodin. Which, Foucault argues, had to be incorporated into a politics of truth. Foucault insists, in referring to the term 'public opinion'('politics of truth'), that the concept of truth refers to the term 'regimes of truth'. He mentions a group called The Ideologues where the term Ideology first appears and is taken from.Peter McCaffery Who were the Ideologues? How Influential Were They? 2004Security, Territory, Population, pp. 55-86, pp. 83-84, note 27, 2007 Foucault argues that it is through 'regimes of truth' that raison d'√©tat achieves its political and biological success.Security, Territory, Population pp. 275-78, p. 283, notes 63-64 2007 Here the modern version of government is presented to the population in the national media‚Äîin the electronic media television and radio, and especially in the written press‚Äîas the modicum of efficiency, fiscal optimisation, political responsibility, and fiscal rigorousness. Thus, a public discourse of government solidarity emerges and social consensus is emphasised through these four points. What general components were essential and necessary to make this consensus happen? Foucault traces the first dynamics, the first historical dimensions, as belonging to the early Middle Ages. One major thinker whose work forms a parallel with Foucault‚Äôs own is the Medieval historian Ernst Kantorowicz.Discipline and Punish pp. 25-29 1977Parrhesia:A Journal of Critical Philosophy 5 pp. 9-18 2008Discipline and Punish p. 330 1977Artur Golczewski Sovereign Right, Democracy and the Rule of Law Universitas 2006 Kantorowicz mentions a Medieval device known as the body politic (the king's two bodies). This Medieval device was so well received by legal theorists and lawyers of the day that it was incorporated and codified into Medieval society and institutions (Kantorowicz mentions the term Corporation which would later become known to us as capitalism, an economic category).Ernst Kantorowicz The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval political theology pp. 273-313 1956. Kantorowicz also refers to the Glossators who belonged to a well-known branch of legal schools in medieval Europe, experts in jurisprudence and law science, appeal of treason, The Lords Appellant and the commentaries of jurist Edmund PlowdenThe commentaries, or Reports of Edmund Plowden 1561 and his Plowden Reports.Duchy Of Lancaster (1561) 1 Plowden 212,213. In Kantorowicz' analysis, a Medieval Political theology emerged throughout the Middle Ages which provided the modern basis for the democratisation of the hereditary succession of a wealthy elite and for our own modern political hierarchical order (Politicians) and their close association with the wealthy nobility.The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology pp. 42-78 and pp. 87-107 1956 Primarily, this is the democratisation of Sovereignty, which is known in modern political terms as \\"Liberal democracy\\". Kantorowicz argues a Medieval triumvirate appears (with the support of the legal machine), a private enterprise of wealth and succession both supporting the fixed hierarchical order reserved exclusively for the nobility and their descendants, and the monarch and her/his heirs. Co- operation was needed by the three groups‚Äîthe Monarchy, the Church, and the Nobility‚Äîin an uneasy Medieval alliance and, at times, it appeared fractious.According to Sidney Madge, the King wasn't the major land owner in medieval Christendom; Madge quite clearly and brilliantly shows at least in one instance the king was only third in line and he had to share that right with others.The Domesday Of Crown Lands, pp. 20‚Äì21, 1938.Much of Madge's information comes from Charles Henry Pearson meticulous study of the domesday records.. Madge places the barons' majority ownership of all land at 50.5% in 1086 (in 1065 it was 50.7%). According to Madge's analysis of Pearson's work, by the time of the Norman conquest the monarch of the day‚Äîthe king‚Äîwasn't, by all accounts, the major land owner; his percentage share was just 20.5% in 1065, before the conquest, and dropped to 19.9% after the conquest in 1086. Moreover, the monarch had to share that right with the powerful Roman Catholic church of the day (the church's share was 28.8% in 1065; at the end of the conquest in 1086 it was 29.6%). This necessitated an efficient accountancy and auditing system with the overall fiscal responsibility and liability of the Exchequer, Treasury and the entire kingdom of the realm (kingdom in this case meaning the Barons and the church who funded the King's expenditure) and its ruler the King, known as the Barons of the exchequer, supervised and organized by the barons of the day.Sidney J Madge, The Domesday Of Crown Lands, pp. 20-21, 1938. Throughout its history, it was never a smooth arrangement; see Barons war. What is the reasoning behind the whole population subservience with the worshiping of state emblems, symbols and related mechanisms with their associates who represent the institutional mechanism (democratization of sovereignty); where fierce loyalty from the population is presented, in modern times as universal admiration for the president, the monarch, the Pope and the prime minister? One could argue whether irony or fierce logic dictates this sort of behaviour. Well, which one is it? Foucault would argue that while all the cost benefits were met by the newly founded urban population in the form of production and Political power, it is precisely this type of behaviour which keeps the well-oiled machine smoothly ticking and ultimately giving the Nation state not only its rationale but its \\"governing less\\" impenetrable apparatus. In other words, it is dictated by our own inherited political rationality, which gives the false impression and appearance of joint solidarity‚Äîgiving the machine (Foucault uses the term Dispositif) not only legitimacy but an air of invincibility from its main primary sources: reason, truth, freedom, and human existence. Foucault makes special note on the biological \\"naturalness\\" of the human species and the new founded scientific interest that was developing around not only with the species interaction with milieu and technology, but most importantly, technology operating as system not as so often portrayed by the political and social sciences which insisted on technology operating as social improvement. Both milieu, natural sciences and technology, allied with the characteristics surrounding social organization and increasingly the categorization of the sciences to help deal with this \\"naturalness\\" of milieu and of the inscription of truth onto nature. Due to Foucault's discussions with Georges Canguilhem,Security, Territory, Population, pp. 26-27, see notes 37-38, 2007 Foucault notices that not only was milieu now a newly discovered scientific biological naturalness ever- present in Lamarckian Biology the notion (biological naturalness) was actually invented and imported from Newtonian mechanics (Classical mechanics) via Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon due to Buffon mentorship and friendship with Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and used by Biology in the middle of the 18th century borrowing from Newton the explanatory model of an organic reaction through the action of \\"milieu Newtonian\\" physics used by Isaac Newton and the Newtonians.Security, Territory, Population, p. 20, pp. 26-27, see notes 33 and 37, 2007 Humans (the species being mentioned in Marx) were now both the object of this newly discovered scientific and \\"natural\\" truth and new categorization, but subjected to it allied by laws, both scientific and natural law (scientific Jurisprudence), the state's mode of governmental rationality to the will of its population. But, most importantly, interaction with the social environment and social interactions with others and the modern nation state's interest in the populations well-being and the destructive capability that the state possess in its armoury and it was with the group who called themselves the √©conomistesofficially known as the Physiocrats, see Security, Territory, Population, pp. 34-53, pp. 55-86, p. 52, note 17, 2007 (Vincent de Gournay, Fran√ßois Quesnay, Fran√ßois V√©ron Duverger de Forbonnais, and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot)Foucault makes mention of Vincent de Gournay in Security, Territory, Population, p. 51, note 15, 2007Security, Territory, Population, pp. 333-61, pp. 348-49, 2007 who continued with the rationalization of this \\"naturalness\\". Foucault notices that this \\"naturalness\\" continues and is extended further with the advent of 18th century political society with the new founded implement \\"population\\" and their (political population) association with raison d'√©tat.Security, Territory, Population, pp. 55-86, p. 81, note 19, and pp. 285-86 2007  See also  * Biopolitics * Biopunk * Foucault's lectures at the Coll√®ge de France * Governmentality *Necropolitics  References   Sources  * Michel Foucault, Society Must Be Defended * Michel Foucault, Security, Territory, Population * Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer * Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Empire * Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Multitude  Further reading  * B√≠os: Biopolitics and Philosophy By Roberto Esposito B√≠os: Biopolitics and Philosophy Contains chapter on Thantopolitics By Roberto Esposito 24 August 2011 * Research In Biopolitics: Volume 9: Biology and Political Behavior: The Brain, Genes and Politics - the Cutting Edge (2011) edited by Steven A.

In November 1943, during the Second World War, Derrick was awarded the Victoria Cross for his assault on a heavily defended Japanese position at Sattelberg, New Guinea. During the engagement, he scaled a cliff face while under heavy fire and silenced seven machine gun posts, before leading his platoon in a charge that destroyed a further three. Born in the Adelaide suburb of Medindie, South Australia, Derrick left school at the age of fourteen and found work in a bakery. As the Great Depression grew worse he lost his job and moved to Berri, working on a fruit farm before marrying in 1939. In July 1941, Derrick enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, joining the 2/48th Battalion. He was posted to the Middle East, where he took part in the Siege of Tobruk, was recommended for the Military Medal and promoted to corporal. Later, at El Alamein, Derrick was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for knocking out three German machine gun posts, destroying two tanks, and capturing one hundred prisoners. Derrick returned to Australia with his battalion in February 1943, before transferring to the South West Pacific Theatre where he fought in the battle to capture Lae. Back in Australia the following February he was posted to an officer cadet training unit, being commissioned lieutenant in November 1944. In April 1945 his battalion was sent to the Pacific island of Morotai, an assembly point for the Allied invasion of the Philippines. Engaged in action the following month on the heavily defended hill Freda on Tarakan Island, Derrick was hit by five bullets from a Japanese machine gun. He died from his wounds on 24 May 1945. Early life Derrick was born in the Adelaide suburb of Medindie, South Australia, on 20 March 1914 to David Derrick, a labourer from Ireland, and his Australian wife, Ada (n√©e Whitcombe). The Derricks were poor, and Tom often walked barefoot to attend Sturt Street Public School and later Le Fevre Peninsula School. In 1928, aged fourteen, Derrick left school and found work in a bakery. By this time, he had developed a keen interest in sports, particularly cricket, Australian Rules Football, boxing and swimming; his diving in the Port River earned him the nickname of \\"Diver\\". With the advent of the Great Depression, Derrick scraped a living from odd jobs‚Äîsuch as fixing bicycles and selling newspapers‚Äîto supplement his job as a baker. When in 1931, the Depression worsened, Derrick lost his bakery job and, with friends, headed by bicycle for the regional town of Berri, approximately away, in search of work. Jobs in Berri were hard to come by and Derrick and two friends spent the next few months living in a tent on the banks of the Murray River. When the annual Royal Adelaide Show opened that year, Derrick went to the boxing pavilion to accept a challenge of staying upright for three rounds with the ex-lightweight champion of Australia. Although he was knocked down in the second round, he immediately got back to his feet and won the bet; albeit at the cost of a black eye, and a few bruised ribs. Eventually, towards the end of 1931, Derrick found work picking fruit at a vineyard in Winkie, a short distance outside Berri. He later moved on to a full-time job at a nearby fruit farm, remaining there for the next nine years. On 24 June 1939, Derrick married Clarance Violet \\"Beryl\\" Leslie‚Äîhis \\"one true love\\" whom he had met at a dance in Adelaide seven years earlier‚Äîat St Laurence's Catholic Church, North Adelaide. Second World War Derrick did not join up when war broke out in September 1939 but, like many Australians, enlisted after the fall of France in June 1940. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940, and was posted to the 2/48th Battalion, 26th Brigade, as a private. Derrick first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds, before basic training at Woodside. Derrick thrived on military life, but found discipline difficult to accept. In October, the 2/48th Battalion paraded through the streets of Adelaide to Mitcham railway station prior to its embarkation for the Middle East. The battalion's voyage overseas was postponed until 17 November, when the unit boarded the SS Stratheden. The ship made a stop at Perth, where Derrick was confined on board for going absent without leave to sightsee. He was soon in more trouble, and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him over this incident. =North Africa= On arrival in Palestine, the 2/48th Battalion encamped at El Kantara and began training in desert warfare. For relaxation, the battalion set up athletic events, and Derrick became well known for often winning cross-country races‚Äîand for organising a book on the outcomes. In March 1941, the unit went by train and truck to Alexandria, Egypt, then along the North African coast to Cyrenaica, in Libya, to join the 9th Australian Division. Sergeant Derrick, November 1943 After the 2/48th Battalion completed its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica, they were moved further along the coast to Gazala. Then, just as they began to dig in, the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to Tobruk in response to the German Afrika Korps' advance. They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops. Although Derrick's bravery was noted during the siege, he wrote in his diary about his constant fear of dying. On the night of 30 April, the Axis forces assaulted Tobruk's outer defences and managed to capture substantial ground. In response, the 2/48th Battalion was ordered to counter-attack the following evening. During the ensuing engagement, Derrick fought as a section member in the far left flank of the attack. After suffering heavy casualties in what Derrick described as \\"a bobby dazzler of a fire fight\\", the battalion was forced to withdraw. Praised for his leadership and bravery during the assault, Derrick was immediately promoted to corporal, and recommended for the Military Medal. The award, however, was never made. In late May, Derrick discovered a German posing as a British tank officer and reported him to company headquarters; the man was immediately arrested as a spy. Following a period of heavy fighting in June, the 2/48th Battalion was placed in reserve for a few days the following month. Promoted to platoon sergeant in September, Derrick‚Äîalong with the rest of his battalion‚Äîwas withdrawn from Tobruk and returned to Palestine aboard HMS Kingston on 22 October. Disembarking at Tel Aviv, they were given three days' leave in the city, before returning for training. Following a period of rest and light garrison duties in Syria, the 2/48th Battalion was rushed to El Alamein, Egypt, to reinforce the British Eighth Army. During the First Battle of El Alamein on 10 July 1942, Derrick took part in the 26th Australian Brigade's attack on Tel el Eisa. In the initial assault, Derrick, against a barrage of German grenades, led an attack against three machine gun posts and succeeded in destroying the positions before capturing over one hundred prisoners. During the Axis counter-attack that evening, the Australian line was overrun by tanks. As the German infantry following the tanks advanced, Derrick's company led a charge against the men. During the engagement, Derrick managed to destroy two German tanks using sticky bombs. Commended for his \\"outstanding leadership and courage\\", Derrick was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his part in the fighting at Tel el Eisa. The award was announced in a supplement to the London Gazette on 18 February 1943. (DCM) Promoted to sergeant on 28 July, Derrick led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German machine gun positions and strongholds; this information was to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein. The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, with the 9th Australian Division taking part. At one point during the engagement, Derrick jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense heavy fire, Derrick attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick's platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick's action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made. For part of 31 October, Derrick assumed command of his company after all of the unit's officers had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting. On 21 November 1942, Derrick was briefly admitted to the 2/3rd Australian Field Ambulance with slight shrapnel wounds to his right hand and buttock. Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, Derrick attended a corps patrolling course. In January 1943, the 2/48th Battalion sailed home to Australia, aboard the S.S. Nieuw Amsterdam, along with the rest of the 9th Division. =South West Pacific= Disembarking at Port Melbourne in late February 1943, Derrick was granted a period of leave and travelled by train to Adelaide where he spent time with Beryl. He rejoined his battalion‚Äînow encamped in the outskirts of Adelaide‚Äîbefore they went by train to the Atherton Tableland for training in jungle warfare. Brought up to full strength by the end of April, the 2/48th Battalion completed its training following landing-craft exercises near Cairns. On 23 July, Derrick was attached to the 21st Brigade Headquarters but admitted to hospital for old injuries to his right eye later the same day. After hospital, Derrick returned briefly to Brigade before rejoining the 2/48th Battalion on 27 August. For much of August, the 2/48th Battalion had been in training for the Allied attack on Lae, in Papua New Guinea. The unit's objective was to land on a strip of land designated as \\"Red Beach\\", and then fight their way approximately west towards Lae. Following a bombardment by American destroyers, Derrick's wave landed on the beach with minimal casualties on 4 September. Ten days later, the 2/48th Battalion's C Company‚Äîled by Derrick's platoon‚Äîcaptured Malahang airstrip, before Lae fell to the Allies on 16 September. Derrick was scornful of the Japanese defence of Lae, and wrote in his diary that \\"our greatest problem was trying to catch up\\" with the retreating Japanese force. Victoria Cross Following Lae, the 9th Division was tasked to seize Finschhafen, clear the Huon Peninsula and gain control of the Vitiaz Strait. By 2 October, one of the division's brigades had gained a foothold on Finschhafen, but soon encountered fierce Japanese resistance. In response to a Japanese counter-attack, the 26th Brigade was transferred to reinforce the Australian position on 20 October and, when the division switched to the offensive in November, the brigade was ordered to capture Sattelberg. Sattelberg was a densely wooded hill rising and dominating the Finschhafen region; it was in an assault on this position that Derrick was to earn the Victoria Cross. The Australian attack on Sattelberg began in mid-November, with the Japanese slowly giving ground and withdrawing back up the precipitous slopes. Each side suffered heavy casualties, and on 20 November, Derrick‚Äîwho had been acting as company sergeant major for the previous month‚Äîwas given command of B Company's 11 platoon after the unit had \\"lost all but one of their leaders\\". By 22 November, the 2/23rd and 2/48th Battalions had reached the southern slopes of Sattelberg, holding a position approximately from the summit. A landslide had blocked the only road, so the final assault was made by infantry alone, without supporting tanks. On 24 November, the 2/48th Battalion's B Company was ordered to outflank a strong Japanese position sited on a cliff face, prior to attacking a feature from the Sattelberg township. The nature of the terrain meant that the only possible route was up a slope covered with kunai grass directly beneath the cliffs. Over a period of two hours, the Australians made several attempts to clamber up the slopes to reach their objective, but each time they were repulsed by intense machine gun fire and grenade attacks. As dusk fell, it appeared impossible to reach the objective or even hold the ground already gained, and the company was ordered to withdraw. In response, Derrick replied to his company commander: \\"Bugger the CO. Just give me twenty more minutes and we'll have this place. Tell him I'm pinned down and can't get out.\\" Sergeant Tom Derrick hoists the Australian Red Ensign at Sattelberg, New Guinea Moving forward with his platoon, Derrick attacked a Japanese post that had been holding up the advance. He destroyed the position with grenades and ordered his second section around to the right flank. The section soon came under heavy machine gun and grenade fire from six Japanese posts. Clambering up the cliff face under heavy fire, Derrick held on with one hand while lobbing grenades into the weapon pits with the other, like \\"a man ... shooting for [a] goal at basketball\\". Climbing further up the cliff and in full view of the Japanese, Derrick continued to attack the posts with grenades before following up with accurate rifle fire. Within twenty minutes, he had reached the peak and cleared seven posts, while the demoralised Japanese defenders fled from their positions to the buildings of Sattelberg. Derrick then returned to his platoon, where he gathered his first and third sections in preparation for an assault on the three remaining machine gun posts in the area. Attacking the posts, Derrick personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades at a range of about , before all three were silenced. Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943. The final assault on Sattelberg became known within the 2/48th Battalion as 'Derrick's Show'. Although he was already a celebrity within the 9th Division, the action brought him to wide public attention. On 23 March 1944, the announcement and accompanying citation for Derrick's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette. It read: (VC) Later war service The 2/48th Battalion remained at Sattelberg until late December 1943, when it returned to the coast in order to regroup. On Christmas Eve, Derrick noted in his diary that the next day would be his \\"4th Xmas overseas\\" and \\"I don't care where I spend the next one I only hope I'm still on deck [alive]\\". On 7 February 1944, the battalion sailed from Finschhafen for Australia, disembarking at Brisbane. Granted home leave, Derrick made his way to South Australia for a short period with Beryl. In April, he was admitted to hospital suffering from malaria before returning to his battalion the following month. During this time, he was charged with being absent without leave and subsequently forfeited a day's pay. Reg Saunders and Tom Derrick congratulate each other on receiving their commissions On 20 August 1944, Derrick was posted to an officer cadet training unit in Victoria. He requested that he be allowed to rejoin the 2/48th Battalion at the end of the course; contrary to normal Army policy that prevented officers commissioned from the ranks from returning to their previous units. An exemption was granted to Derrick only after much lobbying. While at this unit, Derrick shared a tent with Reg Saunders, who later became the Army's first Indigenous Australian officer. Commissioned as a lieutenant on 26 November 1944, Derrick was granted twenty-four days leave. Returning to the 2/48th Battalion as a reinforcement officer, his appointment as a platoon commander in his old company was met by \\"great jubilation\\". During this period, the battalion had been posted to Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tablelands for \\"an extensive training period\\", before being transported from Cairns to Morotai during April 1945. It was around this time that Derrick converted from his Church of England religious denomination and Salvationist beliefs to Catholicism‚Äîhis wife's religion‚Äîthough he was not overtly religious. On 1 May 1945, Derrick took part in the landing at Tarakan; an island off the coast of Borneo. Under the cover of a naval and aerial bombardment, he led his men ashore in the initial waves of the landing, where they were initially posted at the boundary of the 2/48th Battalion and 2/24th Battalion's area of responsibility. The Japanese force on the island mounted a determined resistance, and Derrick was later quoted in the Sunday Sun as saying he had \\"never struck anything so tough as the Japanese on Tarakan\\". Men of the 2/48th Battalion gathered around Derrick's grave during his funeral. Slowly pushing inland, the 2/48th Battalion's main task from 19 May was to capture a heavily defended hill code-named Freda. Derrick's platoon unsuccessfully probed Japanese positions on that day and the next, at a loss of two men killed with others wounded. He later recorded in his diary that these setbacks were a \\"bad show\\". On 21 May, Derrick and Lieutenant Colonel Bob Ainslie, the 2/48th Battalion's commander, debated the optimum size of the unit which should be used to capture the Freda position. Derrick successfully argued that a company was best, given the restrictions posed by the terrain. He was in high spirits that night, possibly in an attempt to lift his platoon's morale. On 22 May, Derrick's was one of two platoons that attacked a well-defended knoll and captured the position. Derrick played a key role in this action, and coordinated both platoons during the final assault that afternoon. After capturing the knoll, the two platoons‚Äîreinforced by two sections of the 2/4th Commando Squadron‚Äîdug in to await an expected Japanese counter-attack. At about 03:30 on 23 May, a Japanese light machine gun fired into the Australian position. Derrick sat upright to see if his men were all right, and was hit by five bullets from the gun's second burst; striking him from his left hip to the right of his chest. His runner, \\"Curly\\" Colby, dragged him behind cover, but Derrick could not be immediately evacuated as Japanese troops attacked at about 04:00. Derrick was in great pain, and told Colby that he had \\"had it\\". Despite his wounds, he continued to issue orders for several hours. When day broke, it was discovered that Derrick's platoon were directly overlooked by a Japanese bunker‚Äîthough this would not have been visible during the assault late the previous evening. When stretcher bearers reached the position at dawn, Derrick insisted that the other wounded be attended to first. Derrick was carried off Freda later that morning, where he was met by the 26th Brigade's commander, Brigadier David Whitehead. The two men briefly conversed before Derrick excused himself, fearing that he had not much time left and wishing to see the padre. Stepping back, Whitehead saluted and sent for Father Arch Bryson. At the hospital, surgeons found that bullets had torn away much of Derrick's liver; he died on 24 May 1945 during a second operation on his wounds. He was buried in the 2/48th Battalion's cemetery on Tarakan that afternoon, and later re-interred at the Labuan War Cemetery, plot 24, row A, grave 9. Legacy Tom Derrick was widely mourned. His widow, Beryl, became prostrate with grief on hearing of his death; many members of the Army were affected, with one soldier lamenting it felt as if \\"the whole war stopped\\". By the time Derrick's death was officially announced on 30 May, most Australians on Tarakan had heard the news and rumours had spread claiming that he had been speared or shot at short range by a sub-machine gun. Derrick's medals on display at the Australian War MemorialLeft-to-right, Derrick's medals are: Victoria Cross; Distinguished Conduct Medal; 1939‚Äì1945 Star; Africa Star; Pacific Star; Defence Medal; War Medal 1939‚Äì1945; Australia Service Medal 1939‚Äì45. References: ; ; The Japanese force on Tarakan learned of Derrick's death and tried to exploit it for propaganda purposes. They printed a leaflet which began \\"We lament over the death of Lieutenant General Terick CinC of Allied Force in Tarakan\\" and later included the question \\"what do you think of the death in action of your Commander in Chief ...?\\" This leaflet reached few Australian soldiers, and had little impact on them. \\"Tokyo Rose\\" also broadcast taunts over \\"Terick's\\" death. Derrick's reputation continued to grow after his death, and many Australian soldiers recalled any association, however slight, they had with him. To many Australians, he embodied the 'ANZAC spirit', and he remains perhaps the best-known Australian soldier of the Second World War. Historian Michael McKernan later remarked that, for his war service, Derrick had arguably deserved \\"a VC and two bars ... at El Alamein, at Sattelberg and now at Tarakan\\". In a 2004 television interview, then Chief of the Australian Defence Force, General Peter Cosgrove, was asked \\"Who was the best soldier of all time?\\" After a short pause, he replied: \\"Diver Derrick\\". This sentiment was endorsed by General Sir Francis Hassett. Hassett‚Äîwho, as a lieutenant colonel, had served at Finschhafen with II Corps headquarters‚Äîstated: Tom 'Diver' Derrick Bridge, Port Adelaide Derrick is also remembered for his personal qualities. He was sensitive and reflective. Despite a limited education, he was a \\"forceful and logical debater, with a thirst for knowledge\\". Derrick kept a diary, composed poetry, collected butterflies and frequently wrote to his wife, while on active service . Historian Peter Stanley has compared Derrick's leadership abilities with those of Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, Ralph Honner and Roden Cutler. On 7 May 1947, Beryl Derrick attended an investiture ceremony at the Government House, Adelaide, where she was presented with her late husband's Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal by the Governor of South Australia, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Norrie. Derrick's Victoria Cross and other medals are now displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, along with a portrait by Sir Ivor Hele. A street in the neighbouring suburb of Campbell and a rest stop in the Remembrance Driveway between Sydney and Canberra were also named in his honour. In 1995, a public park was named the Derrick Memorial Reserve on Carlisle St, Glanville in his honour, and his VC citation is displayed on a plaque there. In June 2008, a newly built bridge over the Port River on the Port River Expressway was named the Tom 'Diver' Derrick Bridge following a public campaign.

Generic Emergency Medical Service flag commonly seen around the US The Star of Life is a blue, six-pointed star, outlined with a white border and usually featuring the Rod of Asclepius in the center. The Star of Life symbol is currently governed by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). It is now a recognized symbol of Emergency Medical Services in multiple countries.  History  The Star of Life was originally designed by the American Medical Association (AMA) in 1963 as the Universal Medical Identification Symbol. The AMA did not trademark or copyright the symbol Universal Medical Identification Symbol. Am J Dis Child. 1964;107(5):439. doi:10.1001/archpedi.1964.02080060441001. The symbol was promoted by the American Red Cross and rapidly adopted worldwide as an emergency medical symbol. In 1970, when the American Medical Association's Committee on Emergency Medical Services formed the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT), the AMA chose the Star of Life as the organization's logo and a symbol to be used to designate nationally certified Emergency Medical Services personnel. In 1973, the NREMT filed for a trademark for the Star of Life logo.

In 1973, the American Red Cross complained that the orange cross too closely resembled their logo of a red cross on a white background, the usage of which is restricted by the Geneva Conventions. Dr. Dawson Mills, Chief of the EMS Branch, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States, asked the National Registry of EMTs for permission to extend the use the Star of Life symbol as the \\"national identifier for Emergency Medical Services\\" in the United States. Leo R. Schwartz, Chief of the EMS Branch, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States, modified the Star of Life by adding the six main tasks of Emergency Medical Services and changing the color the blue. The \\"blue Star of Life\\" was recommended for adoption by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare on October 25, 1973 , and trademarked on February 1, 1977 in the name of the National Highway Traffic Safety and Administration (registration number 1058022).\\"USPTO Trademark Search of US Serial #73033491\\" U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Symbolism  Six points on the Star of Life The six branches of the star represent the six main tasks executed by rescuers all through the emergency chain: # Detection: The first rescuers on the scene, usually untrained civilians or those involved in the incident, observe the scene, understand the problem, identify the dangers to themselves and the others, and take appropriate measures to ensure their safety on the scene (environmental, electricity, chemicals, radiation, etc.). # Reporting: The call for professional help is made and dispatch is connected with the victims, providing emergency medical dispatch. # Response: The first rescuers provide first aid and immediate care to the extent of their capabilities. # On scene care: The EMS personnel arrive and provide immediate care to the extent of their capabilities on-scene. # Care in transit: The EMS personnel proceed to transfer the patient to a hospital via an ambulance or helicopter for specialized care. They provide medical care during the transportation. # Transfer to definitive care: Appropriate specialized care is provided at the hospital.  Common use  An ambulance in Lausanne (Switzerland) marked with multiple Stars of Life. While no agency is tasked solely with enforcing its use as a mark of certification, the Star of Life has traditionally been used as a means of identification for medical personnel, equipment, and vehicles. Many ambulance services mark the symbol on their vehicles, and ambulance crews often wear the design as part of their uniform. It appears on various medical textbooks as well as on a wide range of merchandise aimed at the medic market. In hospitals and other buildings, elevators that are marked with the symbol indicate that the elevator is large enough to hold a stretcher. Unicode The snake-and-staff element of the symbol has a Unicode code point called the Staff of Aesculapius and some fonts may show the Star of Life in this position.

A pair of copies of the marble Medici lions guard the bridge, begun in 1925 and completed in 1927. They were removed in February 2005 and returned in March 2011. Roads & Bridges magazine named the Bridge of Lions as fourth in the nation's top 10 bridges for 2010. Projects were evaluated based on size, community impact and challenges resolved. The United States Department of Transportation declared the bridge \\"structurally deficient and functionally obsolete\\" in 1999, prompting heated debates on what to do with the structure. A restoration plan was approved, but opponents continued to voice their opposition. Reynolds, Smith & Hills from nearby Jacksonville was awarded the engineering and design contract, estimated at $77 million, and projected to require five years to complete. First Bridge Prior to the Bridge of Lions in 1925, there was a wooden bridge, called simply, \\"The Bridge to Anastasia Island\\" or \\"South Beach railroad bridge\\". It was built in 1895, and after a major renovation in 1904, the bridge could accommodate a trolley. The span contained no rise, and had a movable opening for ship traffic, and charged a toll for transit. Original Bridge of Lions The old bridge frequently broke down, leading to calls for its replacement over the years. The man considered the \\"Father of the Bridge of Lions\\" was Henry Rodenbaugh, the vice president and bridge expert for Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway. In the early 1920s he organized the bond issue to finance the new bridge, selected engineers J. E. Greiner Company to design it‚Äîand had his young daughter Jean pour the first bucket of concrete when the work began in 1925. Its construction came at the height of the extravagant Florida land boom of the 1920s, and the bridge is one of its greatest landmarks. It was designed not merely to carry cars, but to be a work of art, and it cost ten times as much as more prosaic bridges constructed nearby at the same time. It was completed after the land boom busted, and the 1927 dedication ceremony had to be paired with the annual Ponce de Leon Celebration in cash-strapped St. Augustine. The Bridge of Lions is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was included by the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) on its list of the \\"11 Most Endangered Historic Sites\\" in the nation for 1997. The Bridge of Lions was later featured on the cover of the Trust's 1999 engagement calendar. From its earliest days, it was hailed as \\"The Most Beautiful Bridge in Dixie.\\" It has long been a symbol of the nation's oldest city. It gets its name from two Carrara marble Medici lions statues that are copies of those found in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, Italy. The statues were a gift of Dr. Andrew Anderson (1839‚Äì1924), the builder of the Markland House, who spent the last decade of his life putting works of art in public places in the Ancient City. The statues were his last gift, and he did not live long enough to see them installed. He had them made by the Romanelli Studios in Florence, Italy, which a decade earlier had provided him with smaller versions which he displayed on the front steps at Markland. The Medici lions are also known for the copies placed in the Throne Room of the Royal Palace of Madrid. Temporary bridge A temporary bridge was constructed adjacent to the original bridge and traffic was diverted to this structure while the original bridge was being rehabilitated and reconstructed to look like its predecessor. After nearly 80 years of service, an official closing ceremony for the original Bridge of Lions was held on May 26, 2006. Isabella Heard, one of the young girls on the lead float in the opening of the bridge in 1927, was there, in a wheelchair, to tie the ribbon for its closing 79 years later. Several components of the original bridge were either rehabilitated or returned (as lost components) to the rehabilitated bridge. Primarily, the exterior or fascia steel girders were rehabilitated along with the bascule tower piers. Once the rehabilitation of the original bridge was completed, at a total project cost of $80 million and 4 percent over budget, the temporary bridge was removed and used as part of an artificial reef just offshore. The two lions were in safe storage for the duration of the construction. New Bridge of Lions Renovation work was completed on March 17, 2010 when it reopened for use. Following the removal of the temporary bridge (to an offshore reef), and landscaping, the restored Lion statues were returned after a 6-year absence, early in the morning of March 15, 2011, principally completing the bridge renovation project. The current bridge's west entrance features manicured gazebos, landscaped palmtrees and a new publicly accessible dock extending partially into the bay. Currently the bridge opens when requested by a vessel only on the hour and half hour between 7:00am and 6:00pm, but not at 8:00am, 12:00pm, and 5:00pm except on Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays.

It is a political wisdom taking into consideration the administration of life and a locality‚Äôs populations as its subject. To quote Foucault, it is ‚Äòto ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order.\\" The term was coined by Rudolf Kjell√©n, a political scientist who also coined the term geopolitics, in his 1905 two-volume work The Great Powers. Kjell√©n sought to study \\"the civil war between social groups\\" (comprising the state) from a biological perspective and thus named his putative discipline \\"biopolitics\\". In Kjell√©n's organicist view, the state was a quasi-biological organism, a \\"super- individual creature\\". In contemporary US political science studies, usage of the term is mostly divided between a poststructuralist group using the meaning assigned by Michel Foucault (denoting social and political power over life) and another group which uses it to denote studies relating biology and political science.Liesen, Laurette T. and Walsh, Mary Barbara, The Competing Meanings of 'Biopolitics' in Political Science: Biological and Post-Modern Approaches to Politics (2011). APSA 2011 Annual Meeting Paper The Nazis also used the term occasionally. For example, Hans Reiter used it in a 1934 speech to refer to their biologically based concept of nation and state and ultimately their racial policy. The first modern usage of the term (in English) starts with an article written by GW Harris in an article for the New Age in 1911 in which he advocates the liquidation of \\"lunatics\\" by 'state lethal chamber'.The New Age 28 December 1911 The concept then starts to gather pace in the 19th century with Walter Bagehot's work Physics and Politics in which he reflects on the term as if he was a trained scientist in the form of Jakob von Uexk√ºll. Bagehot didn't have a scientifically trained mind such as von Uexk√ºll so he (Bagehot) falls rather short in the explanation of the term. Nevertheless the book has some novel points particularly on the subject of natural selection and politics.Walter Bagehot Physics and Politics pp. 40-65 1872 Previous notions of the concept can actually be traced back to the Middle Ages in John of Salisbury's work Policraticus in which the coined term body politic is actually used. In the work of Foucault, biopolitics refers to the style of government that regulates populations through \\"biopower\\" (the application and impact of political power on all aspects of human life).Michel Foucault: Security, Territory, Population, p. 1 (2007) Morley Roberts, in his 1938 book Bio-politics argued that a correct model for world politics is \\"a loose association of cell and protozoa colonies\\". Robert E. Kuttner used the term to refer to his particular brand of \\"scientific racism,\\" as he called it, which he worked out with noted Eustace Mullins, with whom Kuttner cofounded the Institute for Biopolitics in the late 1950s, and also with Glayde Whitney, a behavioral geneticist. Most of his adversaries designate his model as antisemitic. Kuttner and Mullins were inspired by Morley Roberts, who was in turn inspired by Arthur Keith, or both were inspired by each other and either co-wrote together (or with the Institute of Biopolitics) Biopolitics of Organic Materialism dedicated to Roberts and reprinted some of his works. In the works of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, anti-capitalist insurrection using life and the body as weapons; examples include flight from power and, 'in its most tragic and revolting form', suicide terrorism.

This concept uses bios as a term referring to all forms of life on our planet, including their genetic and geographic variation.UNESCO Eolss Publishers Co. Ltd , (2001) Our Fragile World: Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Development Vol. 1, Pg. 1027.

Most of these works agree on three fundamental aspects. First, the object of investigation is primarily political behavior, which‚Äîand this is the underlying assumption‚Äîis caused in a substantial way by objectively demonstrable biological factors. For example, the relationship of biology and political orientation, but also biological correlates of partisanship and voting behavior. (See also sociobiology.)  In the colonial setting  Biopolitics, read as a variation of Foucault‚Äôs Biopower, has proven to be a substantive concept in the field of postcolonial studies. Foucault‚Äôs term refers to the intersection between power (political, economic, judicial etc.) and the individual‚Äôs bodily autonomy.Schirato, T., Danaher, G., & Jen, W. E. B. B. (2012). Understanding Foucault: A critical introduction. Allen & Unwin. p. 90 According to postcolonial theorists, present within the colonial setting are various mechanisms of power that consolidate the political authority of the colonizer; Biopolitics is thus the means by which a colonising force utilises political power to regulate and control the bodily autonomy of the colonized subject, who are oppressed and subaltern. Edward Said, in his work Orientalism, analysed the means by which colonial powers rationalised their relationship with the colonized societies they inhabited through discursive means, and how these discourses continue to influence modern day depictions of the Orient.Said, E. W. (1979). Orientalism. Vintage. p.113 Franz Fanon applied a psychoanalytic frame to his theories of subjectivity, arguing that the subjectivity of the colonized is in constant dialogue with the oppressive political power of the colonizer, a mirroring of the Oedipal father-son dynamic.Fanon, F. (2008). Black skin, white masks. Grove press. While not using the term himself, Fanon‚Äôs work has been cited as a major development in the conceptualisation of biopolitics in the colonial setting.Nayar, P. K. (2019). Fanon and Biopolitics. In Frantz Fanon and Emancipatory Social Theory (pp. 217-230). Brill. Catastrophes are periodically mobilized as vehicles for historical transformation. European states often found themselves grappling with sociobiological propensities of populations. Mercantilism and capitalist modes of production led to a modern biopolitical approach to famine: the modern state depended on providing a diet sufficient to keep the biological machines of industrial capitalism running. The British developed biopolitics in tandem with colonization to help solidify their control over the Irish. The French Third Republic in Western Africa also employed biopolitics in their colonial efforts. The fin-de-siecle revolution in microbiology and specific developments in public health legislation aided the French. Furthermore, thanks to the germ theory of disease pioneered by Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, the etiology of some of the most deadly diseases‚Äîcholera and typhoid‚Äîbegan to be understood in the 1890s, and the French used this new scientific knowledge in the tropics of West Africa. Illnesses like bubonic plague were isolated, and vectors of malaria and yellow fever were identified for the political purpose of public health. They passed public health laws to introduce up-to-date health standards. The goal was for African subjects to respond in exactly the same way as metropolitan citizens to market incentives and new technologies imposed by a progressive state. Thus, public health was a political concern in the sense that the state hoped citizens would be more productive if they lived longer. Michel Foucault French philosopher and social theorist Michel Foucault first discussed his thoughts on biopolitics in his lecture series \\"Society Must Be Defended\\" given at the Coll√®ge de France from 1975 to 1976. Foucault's concept of biopolitics is largely derived from his own notion of biopower, and the extension of state power over both the physical and political bodies of a population. While only mentioned briefly in his \\"Society Must Be Defended\\" lectures, the conceptualisation of biopolitics developed by Foucault has become prominent in social science and the humanities.Lemke, T., Casper, M. J., & Moore, L. J. (2011). Biopolitics: an advanced introduction. NYU Press. Foucault described biopolitics as \\"a new technology of power...[that] exists at a different level, on a different scale, and [that] has a different bearing area, and makes use of very different instruments.\\" More than a disciplinary mechanism, Foucault's biopolitics acts as a control apparatus exerted over a population as a whole or, as Foucault stated, \\"a global mass.\\" In the years that followed, Foucault continued to develop his notions of the biopolitical in his \\"The Birth of Biopolitics\\" and \\"The Courage of Truth\\" lectures.Woodrow Wilson (1918) The New Freedom pp.45-48 Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-HallMichel Foucault (2007) Security, Territory, Population 1977-1978 pp. 311-332 pp. 333-361 pp. 378-380 Foucault gave numerous examples of biopolitical control when he first mentioned the concept in 1976. These examples include \\"ratio of births to deaths, the rate of reproduction, the fertility of a population, and so on.\\" He contrasted this method of social control with political power in the Middle Ages. Whereas in the Middle Ages pandemics made death a permanent and perpetual part of life, this was then shifted around the end of the 18th century with the introduction of milieu into the biological sciences. Foucault then gives different contrasts to the then physical sciences in which the industrialisation of the population was coming to the fore through the concept of work, where Foucault then argues power starts to become a target for this milieu by the 17th century. The development of vaccines and medicines dealing with public hygiene allowed death to be held (and/or withheld) from certain populations. This was the introduction of \\"more subtle, more rational mechanisms: insurance, individual and collective savings, safety measures, and so on.\\" Notes Further reading * Research in Biopolitics: Volume 1: Sexual Politics and Political Feminism Editor Albert Somit (1991) * Research in Biopolitics: Volume 2: Biopolitics and the Mainstream: Contributions of Biology to Political Science Editor Albert Somit (1994) * Research in Biopolitics: Volume 3: Human Nature and Politics Editors Steven A.

After working in a number of office jobs in Melbourne, in 1909 he sailed to Rockhampton and worked as a farm labourer in North Queensland, the Victorian Mallee, Western Australia and Flinders Island. First World War Lieutenant Joynt in 1918. Joynt enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 21 May 1915, was commissioned on 24 December 1915, and arrived in France in May 1916. He fought in France until August 1918, where he was commended in divisional orders, shot in the shoulder, and promoted to lieutenant. On 23 August 1918, he was 29 years old, and a lieutenant in the 8th Battalion (Victoria), Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, when the following events occurred. He was badly wounded by a shell on 26 August and evacuated to England. He was promoted to captain in October 1918, and posted to AIF Headquarters in London in March 1919. He returned to Melbourne in February 1920, and was discharged on 11 June.

The vertical lift offers several benefits over other movable bridges such as the bascule and swing-span bridge. Generally speaking they cost less to build for longer moveable spans.Troyano (2003), p.731 The counterweights in a vertical lift are only required to be equal to the weight of the deck, whereas bascule bridge counterweights must weigh several times as much as the span being lifted. As a result, heavier materials can be used in the deck, and so this type of bridge is especially suited for heavy railroad use. Although most vertical-lift bridges use towers, each equipped with counterweights, some use hydraulic jacks located below the deck. An example is the span bridge at St Paul Avenue in MilwaukeeTroyano (2003), p.729 (see also table bridges). Another design used balance beams to lift the deck, with pivoting bascules located on the top of the lift towers.Troyano (2003), p.732 An example of this kind was built at La Salle in Illinois, USA. The biggest disadvantage to the vertical-lift bridge (in comparison with many other designs) is the height restriction for vessels passing under it. This is a result of the deck remaining suspended above the passageway. Examples See List of vertical- lift bridges.

Together with Gautama Buddha and the bodhisattva Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, he forms the Shakyamuni Triad in Buddhism. He is the patron of the Lotus Sutra and, according to the Avatamsaka Sutra, made the ten great vows which are the basis of a bodhisattva. In Chinese Buddhism, Samantabhadra is known as P«îxi√°n and is associated with action, whereas Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ is associated with praj√±ƒÅ (transcendent wisdom). In Japan, this bodhisattva is known as Fugen, and is often venerated in Tendai and Shingon Buddhism, and as the protector of the Lotus Sutra by Nichiren Buddhism. In the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, Samantabhadra is also the name of the Adi- Buddha, often portrayed in indivisible union (yab-yum) with his consort, Samantabhadrƒ´. Origins In the Lotus S≈´tra, Samantabhadra is described at length in the epilogue, called the Samantabhadra Meditation Sutra (), with special detail given to visualization of the bodhisattva, and the virtues of devotion to him.Kat≈ç Bunno, Tamura Yoshir≈ç, Miyasaka K≈çjir≈ç, tr. (1975), The Threefold Lotus Sutra : The Sutra of Innumerable Meanings; The Sutra of the Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Law; The Sutra of Meditation on the Bodhisattva Universal Virtue. New York & T≈çky≈ç: Weatherhill & K≈çsei Publishing. Samantabhadra is also a key figure in the ƒÄvata·πÉsaka-s≈´tra, particularly the last chapter, the Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha-s≈´tra. In the climax of the Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha-s≈´tra, the student Sudhana meets Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, who teaches him that wisdom only exists for the sake of putting it into practice; that it is only good insofar as it benefits all living beings. In the ƒÄvata·πÉsaka-s≈´tra, the Buddha states that Samantabhadra Bodhisattva made ten great vows in his path to full Buddhahood: # To pay homage and respect to all Buddhas. # To praise the Thus Come One-Tathagata.TH·ª∞C H√ÄNH T·ª™ THI·ªÜN THEO M∆Ø·ªúI ƒê·∫†I NGUY·ªÜN C·ª¶A ƒê·ª®C PH·ªî HI·ªÄN B·ªí T√ÅT # To make abundant offerings. (e.g. give generously) # To repent misdeeds and evil karmas. # To rejoice in others' merits and virtues. # To request the Buddhas to continue teaching. # To request the Buddhas to remain in the world. # To follow the teachings of the Buddhas at all times. # To accommodate and benefit all living beings. # To transfer all merits and virtues to benefit all beings. The ten vows have become a common practice in East Asian Buddhism, particularly the tenth vow, with many Buddhists traditionally dedicating their merit and good works to all beings during Buddhist liturgies. Iconography =In Mahayana Buddhism= , the life Preserver. Unlike his more popular counterpart Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, Samantabhadra is only rarely depicted alone and is usually found in a trinity on the right side of Shakyamuni, mounted on a white elephant. In those traditions that accept the Avatamsaka Sutra as its root instruction, Samantabhadra and Manjusri flank Vairocana Buddha, the central Buddha of this particular sutra. Known as P«îxi√°n in Chinese, he is sometimes shown in Chinese art with feminine characteristics, riding an elephant with six pairs of tusks while carrying a lotus leaf 'parasol' (Sanskrit: chatra), bearing similar dress and features to some feminine depictions of Guanyin. It is in this guise that Samantabhadra is revered as the patron bodhisattva of the monasteries associated with Mount Emei in western China. Some believe that the white elephant mount of Samantabhadra was the same elephant that appeared to Queen Maya, the mother of the Buddha, to herald his birth. Mahayana esoteric traditions treat Samantabhada as one of the 'Primordial' (Sanskrit: Dharmakaya) Buddhas, but the main primordial Buddha is considered to be Vairocana. =In Esoteric Buddhism= Samantabhadra, pictured in Bodhisattva of Universal Virtue who Prolongs Life, 12th-century painting on silk, late Heian period. It is very common for the bodhisattva of the Mahayana tradition with the name of Samantabhadra to be conflated with a Buddha with the same name that appears as the primordial Buddha in some of the Tibetan traditions, particularly the Nyingma. It is not the case that the Mahayana bodhisattva evolved or transformed in the course of assimilation into the esoteric Tibetan traditions, because in the latter both the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra and the Dharmakaya Samantabhadra are present as two separate and distinct entities. In the tradition of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, Dharmakaya Samantabhadra (not the bodhisattva of the Mahayana) is considered the most primordial Buddha, akin in status to Vajradhara for the Sarma traditions. Samantabhadra appears in the Vajrayana tantric text the Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra, as the Primordial Buddha, the 'embodiment' (Sanskrit: kaya) or 'field' (Sanskrit: k·π£etra) of 'timeless awareness, gnosis' (Sanskrit: j√±ƒÅna) awakened since before the very beginning. Therefore, in Tibetan Buddhism the Nyingma, or 'Old Translation' school, the Sakya and the B√∂n schools view Samantabhadra as the Primordial Buddha. In the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhist Vajrayana, Samantabhadra is considered a primordial Buddha in indivisible yab-yum union with his consort Samantabhadri. However, the Kagyu and Gelug schools use Vajradhara to represent the Primordial Buddha. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche following the Nyingmapa Dzogchen tradition qualifies the nature and essence of Samantabhadra, the Primordial Buddha, as the origin-less wellspring of the timeless and unbounded Atiyoga teachings, and honours the converse view entertained by some interested parties which hold that the Dzogchen teachings originated with either the Bonpo tradition or the Chinese monk Moheyan: > Samantabhadra is not subject to limits of time, place, or physical > conditions. Samantabhadra is not a colored being with two eyes, etc. > Samantabhadra is the unity of awareness and emptiness, the unity of > appearances and emptiness, the nature of mind, natural clarity with > unceasing compassion - that is Samantabhadra from the very > beginning.Khyentse, Dzongsar (1990). \\"Introduction: The Significance of This > Biography\\" in: Palmo, Ani Jima (Eugenie de Jong; translator); Nyingpo, Yudra > (compilor, et al.)

Bangkok: White Lotus Press (2009), 18-19 Between 1600 and 1635, more than 350 Japanese ships went overseas under this permit system.  Origins  Record of a Red Seal license, dated 11 January 1608. From the 13th to the 16th century, Japanese ships were quite active in Asian waters, often in the role of \\"wak≈ç\\" pirates who plundered the coast of the Chinese Empire. Official trading missions were also sent to China, such as the Tenry≈´ji-bune around 1341. Wak≈ç activity was efficiently curbed in the late 16th century with the interdiction of piracy by Hideyoshi, and the successful campaigns against pirate activity on the Chinese coast by Ming Dynasty generals. Between the 15th and the 16th century, the main trading intermediary in Eastern Asia was the island kingdom of the Ry≈´ky≈´ (modern Okinawa), which exchanged Japanese products (silver, swords) and Chinese products for Southeast Asian sappan wood and deer hides. Altogether 150 Ryukyuan ships are recorded between the kingdom and Southeast Asia, 61 of them for Annam (Viet Nam), 10 for Malacca, 10 for Pattani, 8 for Java etc... Their commerce disappeared around 1570 with the rise of Chinese merchants and the intervention of Portuguese and Spanish ships, and corresponds with the beginnings of the Red Seal system. The Ry≈´ky≈´ kingdom was finally invaded by Japan in 1609. When the first Europeans started to navigate in the Pacific Ocean (see also Nanban trade period), they regularly encountered Japanese ships, such as when the Spanish welcomed in Manila in 1589 a storm-battered Japanese junk bound for Siam, or when the Dutch circumnavigator Olivier van Noort encountered a 110-ton Japanese junk in the Philippines in December 1600, and on the same voyage a Red Seal ship with a Portuguese captain off Borneo through which they learned about the arrival of William Adams in Japan.  Red Seal system  Sueyoshi red seal ship in 1633, with foreign pilots and sailors. Kiyomizu-dera Ema (ÁµµÈ¶¨) painting, Kyoto. Suminokura red seal ship with foreigners. Kiyomizu-dera Ema painting, Kyoto. The Red Seal system appears from at least 1592, under Hideyoshi, date of the first known mention of the system in a document. The first actually preserved Shuinj≈ç (Red Seal Permit) is dated to 1604, under Tokugawa Ieyasu, first ruler of Tokugawa Japan. Tokugawa issued red-sealed permits to his favourite feudal lords and principal merchants who were interested in foreign trade. By doing so, he was able to control Japanese traders and reduce Japanese piracy in the South Sea. His seal also guaranteed the protection of the ships, since he vowed to pursue any pirate or nation who would violate it. Besides Japanese traders, 12 European and 11 Chinese residents, including William Adams and Jan Joosten, are known to have received permits. At one point after 1621, Jan Joosten is recorded to have possessed 10 Red Seal Ships for commerce. Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, English ships and Asian rulers basically protected Japanese red seal ships, since they had diplomatic relations with the Japanese sh≈çgun. Only Ming China had nothing to do with this practice, because the Empire officially prohibited Japanese ships from entering Chinese ports. (But Ming officials were not able to stop Chinese smugglers from setting sail to Japan.)  Ship design  A 17th-century Red Seal ship of the Araki trading family, sailing out of Nagasaki for Annam (Vietnam) Red Seal ships usually ranged in size between 500 and 750 tons, a size equal or superior to European galleons, but inferior to that of the massive Portuguese carracks, which were often over 1,000 tons or to a Manila Galleon which was often around 2,000 tons. The complement was about 200 people per ship (the average of the fifteen Red Seal ships for which the number of people is known, is 236). The ships were built in various places. Some of them, built in Nagasaki, combined Western, Japanese and Chinese ship designs. Others were Chinese junks. And once the trade with Southeast Asia became well established, numerous ships were ordered and purchased in Ayutthaya in Siam, due to the excellence of the construction and the quality of Thai wood. The ships were managed by rich trading families such as the Suminokura, Araki, Chaya and Sueyoshi, or by individual adventurers such as Suetsugu Heiz≈ç, Yamada Nagamasa, William Adams, Jan Joosten or Murayama T≈çan. The funds for the purchase of merchandise in Asia were loaned to the managers of the expedition for an interest of 35% to 55% per trip, going as high as 100% in the case of Siam.  Import and export  Japanese merchants mainly exported silver, diamonds, copper, swords and other artifacts, and imported Chinese silk as well as some Southeast Asian products (like sugar and deer skins). Pepper and spices were rarely imported into Japan, where people did not eat a great deal of meat due to the local preponderance of adherents to the Buddhist belief system. Southeast Asian ports provided meeting places for Japanese and Chinese ships.  Destinations  portolan sailing map, depicting the Indian Ocean and the East Asian coast, early 17th century. The crew of the red seal ships were international, for many Chinese, Portuguese, and Dutch pilots and interpreters joined the sails. The first Red Seal ships were required to have a Portuguese pilot on board, although the Japanese progressively developed pilots of their own. The Portolan maps used on the Red Seal ships were drawn on the Portuguese model, with directions in the Japanese language. Major Southeast Asian ports, including Filipino Manila, Vietnamese Hoi An, Siamese Ayutthaya, Malay Pattani, welcomed the Japanese merchant ships, and many Japanese settled in these ports, forming small Japanese enclaves.William Wray, ‚ÄúThe Seventeenth- century Japanese Diaspora: Questions of Boundary and Policy,‚Äù in Ina Baghdiantz McCabe et al (eds.), Diaspora Entrepreneurial Networks, Oxford: Berg (2005), 82. The Japanese seem to have been feared throughout Asian countries, according to a contemporary, Sir Edward Michelbourne: > The Japons are not suffered to land in any port in India (Asia) with > weapons; being accounted a people so desperate and daring, that they are > feared in all places where they come.Boxer, The Christian Century, p. 268 A Dutch commander wrote (c. 1615): \\"they are a rough and a fearless people, lambs in their own country, but well-nigh devils outside of it\\". =The Philippines= Around 50 Red Seal ships to Luzon in the Philippines are recorded between 1604 and 1624 (and only 4 more recorded by 1635). The Japanese had established quite early an enclave at Dilao, a suburb of Manila, where they numbered between 300 and 400 in 1593. In 1603, during the Sangley rebellion, they numbered 1,500 and 3,000 in 1606. The Franciscan friar Luis Sotelo was involved in the support of the Dilao enclave between 1600 and 1608. The Japanese led an abortive rebellion in Dilao against the Spanish in 1606‚Äì1607. Their numbers rose again with the interdiction of Christianity by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1614, when 300 Japanese Christian refugees under Takayama Ukon settled in the Philippines. In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of Japanese traders also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population. They are at the origin of today's 200,000-strong Japanese population in the Philippines. =Siam (Thailand)= Yamada Nagamasa c.1630. The Siamese \\"Chronicles of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya\\" record that already in 1592, 500 Japanese troops under the King of Siam helped defeat an invading Burmese army.Yoko Nagazumi Around 56 Red Seal ships to Siam are recorded between 1604 and 1635. The Japanese community in Siam seems to have been in the hundreds, as described by the Portuguese Catholic priest Ant√≥nio Francisco Cardim, who recounted having administered sacrament to around 400 Japanese Christians in 1627 in the Thai capital of Ayuthaya (\\"a 400 jap√µes christ√£os\\") (Ishii Yoneo, Multicultural Japan). In December 1605, John Davis, the famous English explorer, was killed by Japanese pirates off the coast of Siam, thus becoming the first Englishman to be killed by a Japanese.Stephen Turnbull, Fighting ships of the Far East, p. 12, Osprey Publishing The colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer-hide and sappan wood to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and Japanese handicrafts (swords, lacquered boxes, high-quality papers). They were noted by the Dutch for challenging the trade monopoly of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), as their strong position with the King of Siam typically allowed them to buy at least 50% of the total production, leaving small quantities of a lesser quality to other traders. A Japanese adventurer, Yamada Nagamasa, became very influential and ruled part of the kingdom of Siam (Thailand) during that period. The colony also had an important military role in Thailand. =Macau= Although prohibited by China from touching Chinese soil, Japanese sailors from Red Seal ships transited through the Portuguese port of Macau on the Chinese coast in some numbers. In November 1608, a fight between about 100 Japanese samurai, wielding katana and muskets, and Portuguese soldiers under the acting governor and Captain of the Japan voyage Andr√© Pessoa led to a fight in which 50 Japanese lost their lives. The remaining 50 were released by the authorities after having to sign an affidavit blaming themselves for the incident. Ieyasu prohibited visits to Macau by Japanese nationals in 1609: : Since it is an undoubted fact that the going of Japanese in ships to Macau is prejudicial to that place, this practice will be strictly prohibited for the future. (25 July 1609, Ieyasu Shuinjo, remitted to Mateus Leit√£o)Boxer, The Christian Century, p. 272 =Indonesia= Nine Japanese samurai were employed at Amboyna in 1623, when they were victim of the Amboyna massacre. Although few Red Seal Ships are recorded for the areas of modern Indonesia (Java, Spice Islands), possibly because of the remoteness and because of the direct Dutch involvement there, Japanese samurai were recruited by the Dutch in the area. They distinguished themselves in the capture of the Banda Islands from the English and the defense of Batavia, until the practice of hiring Japanese mercenaries was prohibited by the Sh≈çgun in 1621. In 1618, Coen, the Dutch governor of Java, requested 25 Japanese Samurai to be sent to him from Japan. In 1620, the Dutch record that 90 Japanese samurai were recruited from the islands surrounding Java, in order to reinforce the fort of Batavia. In 1623, during the Amboyna massacre, 9 Japanese mercenaries were recorded to have been with the 10 English traders of the British East India Company factory. They were tortured and killed by Dutch forces from the neighbouring factory. (See Chapter 11 \\"Trial by Fire and Water\\" in Nathaniel's Nutmeg.) This event was partly the cause for the advent of the Anglo-Dutch Wars. =India= Tenjiku Tokubei, 17th century. The Japanese adventurer Tenjiku \\"Indie\\" Tokubei is related to have travelled to Siam as well as India on board a Red Seal ship with Jan Joosten. Upon his return to Japan, Tokubei wrote an essay titled \\"Tenjiku T≈çkai Monogatari\\" (Relations of travels to India) on his adventures in foreign countries, which became very popular in Japan. He is sometimes referred to as the Marco Polo of Japan. =Other destinations= Other major destinations included Cochinchina (74 ships), Cambodia (44 ships), Taiwan (35 ships), and Annam in Vietnam (14 ships). Relative importance The 350 Red Seal ships recorded between 1604 and 1634, averaging about 10 ships per year, could be compared to the single Portuguese carrack visiting Nagasaki from Macau every year, which was larger in tonnage (between 2 and 3 times a single Red Seal ship), and carried a rich cargo of silk directly obtained from China. Also in comparison, the English factory (trading post) in Hirado only received four ships from England in the space of 10 years (during its existence between 1613 and 1623), with generally non-valuable cargo. To survive, the factory actually had to resort to trade between Japan and Southeast Asia under the Red Seal system, organizing seven expeditions, four of which were handled by William Adams. The Japanese Sh≈çgun was very defiant of Spain, and Spain very reluctant to divert shipping resources between distant territories, so that besides the few shipwrecks of the Manila galleon on the Japanese coast, only about one Spanish ship was dispatched to Japan every year for trade. They had a small base in Uraga, where William Adams was put in charge of selling the cargo on several occasions. Only Chinese shipping seems to have been quite important during the last years of the Ming dynasty. Richard Cocks, head of the English factory in Hirado, reported that 60 to 70 Chinese junks visited Nagasaki in 1614, sailed by Fukienese smugglers. In 1612, overall, Portuguese priest Valentim de Carvalho, head of the Jesuit mission, stated that the annual \\"Great Ship\\" from Macau brought 1,300 quintals of silk, whereas 5,000 quintals were brought in Red Seal ships and ships from China and Manila.  End of the system  In 1635, the Tokugawa Shogunate officially prohibited their citizens from overseas travel (similar to the much later Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907), thus ending the period of red-seal trade. This action caused the multi- national United East India Company to become the sole officially sanctioned party for European trades, with Batavia as its Asian headquarters.

Artifacts from the culture are found primarily in the Liaoning area of northeast China and in the Korean peninsula. Various other bronze artifacts, including ornaments and weapons, are associated with the culture, but the daggers are viewed as the most characteristic. Liaoning bronzes contain a higher percentage of zinc than those of the neighboring bronze cultures. Lee Chung- kyu (1996) considers that the culture is properly divided into five phases: Phases I and II typified by violin-shaped daggers, Phases IV and V by slender daggers, and Phase III by the transition between the two. Of these, remains from Phases I, II and III can be found in some amounts in both the Korean peninsula and northeast China, but remains from Phases IV and V are found almost exclusively in Korea. Violin-shaped daggers Liaoning-style violin- shaped bronze knives from Korea held at the War Memorial (Seoul). The early phase consists of an early period of bronze manufacture without daggers, followed by a period of producing violin-shaped daggers. The prime period of production of violin-shaped daggers is dated to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. The earliest artifacts from this period are found exclusively in China (mostly in the former territory of Gojoseon - the territory of the kingdom is approximated by the distribution of violin-shaped daggers and table-shaped dolmens), and seem only gradually to have spread to the Korean peninsula. By Lee's (1996) Phase II, however, a distinctive notched form of dagger begins to emerge in southern Korea, suggesting that by this time independent bronze production had begun in that region. Evidence gained from pottery indicates that the bronze dagger \\"culture\\" of this time actually included several distinct cultural groups. One distinct pottery tradition is found in northeast China and northwestern Korea, another in the Taedong River valley, another in the southwest around the Chungcheong provinces including the Geum River, and yet another throughout the rest of the southern Korean peninsula including Jeju island. Slender daggers This later part of the Liaoning bronze dagger culture is often referred to as the \\"Korean bronze dagger culture,\\" since it was largely restricted to the Korean peninsula. At this point the Liaoning culture artifacts begin to disappear from the northeast China area. A new form of dagger begins to turn up on the Korean peninsula, straight and slender. The greatest concentration of bronze daggers is found in the Geum River valley of South Chungcheong province. Away from this area, the daggers become progressively fewer. This appears to indicate that most daggers were produced in the Geum valley, and the other cultures of the peninsula acquired them primarily by trade. Trade also took place by sea, with artifacts from the Later Phase found in Japanese archeological sites as well. Lee (1996) divides this phase into two distinct sections: one dating to the 3rd century BC in which the production of slender bronze daggers predominated, and one dating to the 2nd century BC in which daggers are often accompanied by bronze mirrors with geometric designs and halberds influenced by the Chinese Qin state. In the first part, a single pottery culture typified by clay-band applique is found throughout the Korean peninsula, but in the second part distinctive pottery types emerge in the northwest and the remainder of the peninsula.  Historical identity  The disappearance of the Liaoning bronze dagger culture from China appears to coincide with the State of Yan's conquest of that area. The Korean bronze dagger culture of the Later Phase appears to correspond with the state of Jin, which occasionally enters Chinese annals as a contemporary of Wiman Joseon. Lee (1984, p. 13) views this as the period of emergence of the \\"walled-town states\\" in Korean culture, a hierarchical political structure in contrast to the tribal system which had prevailed during the Neolithic period.

Over a 40-year career, he completed a body of work including novels, short stories, and screenplays. Early years and education Brad Linaweaver was born September 1, 1952, in Washington, North Carolina, the only child of Melville and June Linaweaver. The family moved to the outskirts of Orlando, Florida in 1958, when Brad was 6 years old, where his father engaged in real estate development and investments. Linaweaver attended Orange County public schools, before attending Florida State University. He obtained his MFA degree in a program for poets and writers from Rollins College. Although he spent the better part of his career in Hollywood, he eventually settled at the family lake front home in Apopka, which his father designed and built shortly after moving to Florida in 1958. Career =Political essayist= In late 1970, during his freshman year at Florida State University, Linaweaver joined the local college chapter of the national conservative organization Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). Both conservative and libertarian ideologies were represented within the local YAF chapter, prompting Linaweaver to begin writing and debating about the various political philosophies competing for followers on college campuses at that time. This eventually led to his first sale to a national publication, a short article The Wish, which made the case for capitalism over socialism. The article appeared in The New Guard, the magazine published by YAF. Subsequent articles in that publication drew the attention of public intellectual, conservative author, and YAF founder William F. Buckley. Linaweaver and Buckley subsequently struck up a friendship and correspondence, which lasted decades until Buckley's death in 2008. Through that relationship, Linaweaver eventually published essays in Buckley's magazine National Review. Unknown to him at the time, Linaweaver's writing also caught the attention of Ronald Reagan. In 1976, Reagan devoted one of his radio show broadcasts to a discussion of The Wish, praising Linaweaver in the process. Reagan summed up his commentary on Linaweaver with the line, \\"How right he is!\\" The radio broadcast is included in the Reagan CD set In His Own Voice and in the book Stories in His Own Hand: The Everyday Wisdom of Ronald Reagan. Linaweaver didn't learn about the endorsement from Reagan until decades later. He mused that if he had known about it earlier, it might have changed the trajectory of his career path. \\"I never would have had my career in Hollywood. I might have been a boring political hack in Washington, trying to capitalize on the Reagan endorsement to be a political speechwriter. I'd be a worse libertarian than I am today.\\" Instead, Linaweaver soon took up writing science fiction, and stories for movies, inserting his libertarian ideology into the works whenever feasible. In a 2007 interview, he noted that \\"I've been getting libertarian messages into everything for a quarter of a century\\". But, he observed, not every genre lent itself to his form of political promotionalism. \\"My involvement with movies has been mostly low-budget, exploitation stuff where ideology is not that relevant. When you're writing science fiction for a New York publisher, you actually achieve something when you slip in a libertarian idea. But with independent, exploitation, low-budget Hollywood, there's already an anti-authoritarian attitude. That culture is by nature fairly libertarian. There's less need to be a propagandist.\\" =Film= Linaweaver began his film career in 1978 with an original story credit for The Brain Leeches, the film that also jump started the career of prodigious Hollywood director producer (and sometimes professional wrestler) Fred Olen Ray. The Brain Leeches was completed, on budget, for $298.00. His association with Ray continued throughout Linaweaver's life, and included work on Jack-O which Linaweaver wrote and Ray produced, as well as later projects like Super Shark, a 2011 Ray film where Linaweaver was executive producer. Linaweaver's long association with independent film also included writing credits on low budget direct-to-video titles like The Boneyard Collection, Space Babes Meet the Monsters and The Low Budget Time Machine. Linaweaver's association with Ray, and others, led to a number of small acting roles, both uncredited and 16 credited in numerous independent films. =Science fiction= Linaweaver's first published science fiction sale was in the July 1980 issue of Fantastic with the short story The Competitor, which was later adapted as a radio play and stage production by the Atlanta Radio Theatre Company. Moon of Ice What soon followed is considered Linaweaver's magnum opus, Moon of Ice. It is an alternate history tale that has Nazi Germany being the first to develop an atomic bomb, and using it to defeat the Soviet Union and Great Britain...only to reach a stalemate with the United States, which uses its own atomic bomb to defeat Japan. The work allowed Linaweaver to expound upon the different outcomes of economic models (National Socialism in Germany, Libertarianism in the United States), as well as the little known cultist underpinnings and beliefs of the Nazi regime. The work began in the form of a novella, which soon drew the attention of the science fiction community, resulting in a 1983 nomination for the Nebula Award, and finishing as a finalist in that category. Linaweaver then expanded the story to novel length, firmly establishing himself within the realm of Libertarian science fiction writers, and winning a Prometheus Award. The novel garnered the endorsements of no less than Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, and William F. Buckley, Jr.. While many reviews praised the handling of economic themes, and Linaweaver's research into the little known cultist beliefs of some Nazi elites (including a hollow earth, and a moon made of ice), some found fault with the story telling, opining that the torrent of information \\"numbs rather than stimulates\\". Other novels His novel Sliders, based on the television series of the same name, includes a thorough critique of communism, expanding on ideas Linaweaver first explored in The Wish at the beginning of his career. His other novels include The Land Beyond Summer, four Doom novels with Dafydd ab Hugh, three Battlestar Galactica novels with actor Richard Hatch, and Anarquia with J. Kent Hastings, an alternate history treatment of the Spanish Civil War. The first collection of his short stories was published under the title Clownface. Over his career, Linaweaver wrote more than 50 stories that found their way into print. Collaborations and awards Linaweaver's 1995 story collaboration with Victor Koman, The Light That Blinds featured an occult battle between Aleister Crowley and Adolf Hitler.Kramer, Edward E. Dark Destiny: Proprietors of Fate. Clarkston, GA: White Wolf Publishing, 1995, pp. 232‚Äì51 In 1993, Linaweaver's short story Unmerited Favor was published in Mike Resnick's anthology Alternate Warriors. In 1998, Linaweaver's short story And to the Republic For Which It Stands was published in Harry Turtledove's anthology Alternate Generals. In 2005, his short story A Good Bag was collected in another of Turtledove's anthologies Alternate Generals III. In 2004, he co-authored Worlds of Tomorrow with former movie magazine editor and film memorabilia collector Forrest J Ackerman. The hardcover coffee table book featured cover art from science fiction's Golden Age, from Ackerman's considerable collection, and included full color reproductions and commentary from the authors. Linaweaver shared a second Prometheus Award with Ed Kramer for co-editing Free Space, a libertarian science fiction anthology from TOR books. Several of his short stories received Honorable Mention in The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror by Ellen Datlow. Those stories included The Lon Chaney Factory, Clutter, A Real Babe, and Chump Hoist. The Science Fiction story, Wells of Wisdom made the preliminary Nebula ballot and was part of the Galaxy Audio Project, read by Catherine Oxenberg. =Web series= Linaweaver also wrote and produced online content, including the award-winning web series Silicon Assassin, starring Richard Hatch, currently available on YouTube.YouTube - Silicon Assassin series =Magazine publishing= Linaweaver's many years in Hollywood, and the stories and personalities he had come to know while living there, culminated in the creation of movie magazine Mondo Cult, with Linaweaver as publisher. The magazine featured literary contributions from, and articles about, Linaweaver's eclectic list of celebrity friends and contacts, including Battlestar Galactica actor Richard Hatch; science fiction author and collector Forrest J. Ackerman; the conservative commentator, publisher, and television personality William F. Buckley, Jr.; adult cinema legend Traci Lords and poetry from speculative fiction icon Ray Bradbury and Linaweaver's college friend and YAF colleague, Georgia State Representative Chesley V. Morton. Mondo Cult is edited by former Famous Monsters of Filmland editor, Jessie Lilley. Heinlein's brass cannon Linaweaver owned a signaling gun, or small brass cannon, which had originally belonged to science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein. Heinlein and his wife Virginia, had acquired the cannon in 1964, immediately following the Goldwater campaign. It later provided inspiration for The Brass Cannon which was Heinlein‚Äôs working title for the 1966 novel which eventually became The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. In that novel, Heinlein refers to the cannon, in a parable implying that self-government is an illusion caused by failure to understand reality. For nearly 30 years, the firing of the brass cannon was a July 4 tradition at the Heinlein residence. Virginia Heinlein retained the cannon after her husband's death in 1988, and it was bequeathed to Linaweaver in her will, after Virginia died in 2003. Linaweaver restored the cannon to working order and subsequently posted a 2007 video of it being fired several times (with very small charges) on YouTube. Death Brad Linaweaver, age 66, died August 29, 2019 of cancer at his home in Apopka, Florida.

The Confederate Powderworks (a.k.a. the Augusta Powderworks) was a gunpowder factory during the American Civil War, the only permanent structures completed by the Confederate States of America.Bragg, C. L. (2001) \\"The Augusta powder works: The Confederacy's manufacturing triumph\\", American Rifleman 149(5), pp 58. Colonel George Washington Rains chose the old United States Arsenal site between the Canal and Savannah River in Augusta, Georgia, as a secure inland location with good rail and water connections. History Rains graduated from West Point with the class of 1842 and served as a chemistry teacher for the Military Academy. He had resigned to become president of an iron works in Newburgh, New York. At the start of the Civil War he chose allegiance to his native North Carolina and returned to the south. He was placed in charge of the Gunpowder and Niter Bureau by Jefferson Davis the president of the Confederacy. Construction began in September 1861, a 130 hp steam engine was purchased from the Atlanta flour mill owned by Richard PetersShingleton, Royce, Richard Peters (1985), p.82 and the Powderworks was producing gunpowder in just 7 months in 1862. Rains was guided by a pamphlet written by a British artillery officer describing the powder works at Waltham Abbey in Essex County near London, and also found someone who had worked there to advise him. As was customary for gunpowder mills, the buildings were separated and designed to survive explosions, with raw materials starting at one end, and the finished powder ending a mile and a half away at the other end. The saltpeter refinery building was the largest, and was designed in Gothic style as a replica of the British Houses of Parliament. The Confederate Powderworks was the second largest gunpowder factory in the world at that time, 1862-1865, during the 19th century, producing 3.5 tons a day. More than 2.75 million pounds of first-quality gunpowder (a majority of the powder used by the Confederacy), was produced here before its closure on April 18, 1865.Sibley Mill and Confederate Powder Works Chimney-Augusta: National Park Service By comparison, Union gunpowder manufacture was distributed among many mills, with the larger Hazard Powder Company of Connecticut producing forty percent of the annual production of 8.4 million pounds. It has been said the Confederacy never lost a battle for lack of powder. Although the massive works were seized and dismantled after the war ended, the commandant, Colonel G.W. Rains, asked in 1872, that the Obelisk Chimney be spared as he had designed it to \\"... remain a monument to the Confederacy should the Powderworks pass away\\". On June 2, 1879, the city of Augusta gave custody of the Chimney to the Confederate Survivors Association of Augusta to \\"beautify it and protect it from injury as a Confederate Memorial\\". The CSA of Augusta repaired the square castellated base, protected the corners and in the face, looking towards the canal inserted a large tablet of Italian marble, bearing this inscription: \\"This Obelisk Chimney ‚Äî sole remnant of the extensive Powder Works here erected under the auspices of the Confederate Government ‚Äî is by the Confederate Survivors' Association of Augusta, with the consent of the City Council, conserved in Honor of a fallen Nation, and inscribed to the memory of those who died in the Southern Armies during the War Between the States\\". Today The 150 foot Powderworks chimney still stands on the Augusta Canal and is one of the more recognizable features of the Augusta skyline today, located at the Sibley Mill at 1717 Goodrich Street in Augusta. The Sibley cotton mill was built on the site as a private venture in 1880‚Äì82, using bricks from the demolished powder works, and became one of the largest and most successful cotton mills in the region, a model of good management and worker relations. It manufactured denim until 2006, and the mill's water-driven turbines still generate electricity which is sold to Georgia Power. The chimney is the only remaining portion of the original Works. The B/G E. Porter Alexander Camp #158, Sons of Confederate Veterans, spent eight years raising $192,000 to restore the chimney with its historical marker; work started on November 19, 2009, and was completed on March 12, 2010.

Santa Luc√≠a Hill (), also known in Mapuche as Huel√©n Hill (), is a small hill in the centre of Santiago, Chile. It is situated between Alameda del Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins in the south, Santa Luc√≠a Street in the west and Victoria Subercaseaux on the east. An adjacent metro station is named after it. The hill has an altitude of 629 m and a height of 69 m over the surrounding area. The hill is the remnant of a volcano 15 million years old.http://www.letsgochile.com/locations/central-zone/rm/cerro-santa-lucia Cerro Santa Lucia The hill comprises a 65,300 square metre parkhttp://www.educarchile.cl/Portal.Base/Web/VerContenido.aspx?ID=183385 adorned with ornate facades, stairways and fountains. At the highest point there is a viewpoint popular with tourists visiting the city. History It was originally called Huelito o heutrecan by the pre-colonization inhabitants. However, the current name comes from the day in which Pedro de Valdivia conquered the hill, on December 13, 1540. That day celebrates \\"Santa Luc√≠a.\\" Its first use by its missionaries was as a point of worship, or prayer in the years of the chicken pox outbreak (1541). In 1816, Manuel Olaguer Feli√∫, the Brigadier of the Royal Engineers, designed and built two forts or castles on Santa Luc√≠a Hill, one north and the other south of the hill. The forts were built out of stone and lime and could fit eight or twelve cannons each. Besides, Olaguer Feli√∫ drew and built an outbuilding for ammunition depot and to house the garrison. On one side of the hill, Fort Hidalgo was finished in 1820 as a defensive point. On the other side, the hillside terrain was used as a \\"cemetery for the dissidents\\", people who did not follow the then-official Roman Catholic faith, or were considered otherwise unworthy of burial at hallowed grounds. However, the remains buried in the hillside under this fashion were eventually transferred to a secluded section of the General Cemetery, before said cemetery, in turn, was opened to all burials regardless of creed or social condition. In 1849 James Melville Gilliss led an American naval astronomical expedition to Chile in order to more precisely measure the solar parallax. An observatory was set up on Santa Luc√≠a Hill and operated by Gilliss. When the expedition ended in September 1852 the observatory and related equipment was sold to the Chilean government and formed the nucleus of the first National Astronomical Observatory. In 1872 Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna decided to conduct a dramatic change to the urban atmosphere of the city of Santiago, among his many works aimed to improve the city, and thus initiated an extensive remodelation of the hill. The works of 1872 consisted of a road which crossed the hill, which at the top accessed a chapel which he also built there, illuminated by the then-novel means of gas. The rest of the hill contains a park with fountains and lookouts. The actual hill is watered by a sophisticated irrigation system. The now iconic yellow and white facade is also a product of Vicu√±a Mackenna's remodelation. Vicu√±a Mackenna was assisted in realizing his designs by the architect Manuel Aldunate, the constructor Enrique Henes, and the stonecutter Andr√©s Staimbuck. A few years ago, Santa Luc√≠a hill received an improvement in its illumination system and protections. Also, Fort Hidalgo was restored and reopened to the public. Traditionally, a cannon shot is fired exactly at noon. Curiosity Located in Santa Luc√≠a Hill there is a monument which consists of a 2 m high stone carved with a paragraph extracted from the text that Pedro de Valdivia sent to the Emperor Carlos V describing the features of the new land conquered. In popular culture Santa Luc√≠a Hill is one of the entrances to the abyss in the videogame Abyss Odyssey, the entrance is located in the east part of the Terraza Neptuno.

Early life Harrison was born in Hull on 12 November 1890. His father was a plater and boilermaker in the Earles Shipyard. After leaving school, Harrison studied at St John's College, York (now York St John University) where he was Rugby club captain and also represented the College at cricket and swimming before becoming a teacher later at Lime Street School in Hull.National Union of Teachers War Record, 1914‚Äì1919 In York, he caught the attention of the York rugby league club, and played for them five times in 1911‚Äì12, scoring three tries. He returned to Hull in September 1912 and married Lillian on 1 September 1914. He was invited to join Hull F.C. which included Billy Batten, and played his first match on 5 September 1912. In 1913‚Äì14 season he scored a record 52 tries and he went on to score a total of 106 tries in 116 matches for Hull up to 1916.

The failure of the Communists to take the island left it in the hands of the Kuomintang (Nationalists) and crushed their chances of taking Taiwan to destroy the Nationalists completely in the war. Prelude Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the government of the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek began withdrawing its forces from mainland China to Taiwan. However, ROC garrisons remained stationed on the islands of Quemoy (Kinmen) and Matsu, located off the coast in Fujian Province. Commanders of the PRC People's Liberation Army (PLA) believed that Quemoy (Kinmen) and Matsu had to be taken before a final assault on Taiwan. The PLA planned to attack Kinmen from nearby Aotou () (in Xindian, Xiamen), Dadeng (Tateng) and Lianhe (Lienho) () (then part of Nan'an County, now also in Xindian) by launching a first attack with 9,000 troops to establish a beachhead, before landing a second force of roughly 10,000 on Greater Kinmen Island, expecting to take the entire island in three days from an ROC garrison not expected to be larger than two divisions. The Communists had incorrectly estimated that there were only 12,000 Nationalist soldiers on the entire island with the belief that they consist of green recruits and demoralized remnants of conscripted units that had survived defeats in central China ‚Äì a miscalculation that would contribute to their calamitous defeat.https://www.historynet.com/gallery-the-battle-that- saved-taiwan.htm Expecting that a PLA attack was imminent, ROC commanders ordered the immediate construction of fortifications. By October, ROC troops had laid 7,455 land mines, and constructed roughly 200 earthen bunkers on the shores of Kinmen, as well as several anti-amphibious landing beach obstacles. The ROC garrison on Kinmen was also reinforced with armor (1st Battalion, 3rd Tank Regiment which are veterans of Burma campaign, consisting of 22 M5A1 Stuart light tanks organized into two tank companies), battle-hardened infantry, and supplies from the 12th Army.https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2016/12/06/battle-of-guningtou-the- republic-of-china-fights-for-survival/ In the opening hours of October 25, the PLA's armada (consisting of hundreds of wooden fishing boats) set sail for Kinmen. They intended to land near the village of Longkou on the narrowest part of the island. But due to the crudeness of their craft, choppy waters and winds, many of them were scattered and carried past Longkou and northwestwards toward the shore of Guningtou instead. Battle =October 25= Around 01:30 on October 25, a Nationalist patrol accidentally set off one of the land mines. The blast alerted other units all along the northern shore and the PLA's quiet approach to Kinmen was compromised. Immediately, flares were fired into the air by ROC troops, which brightly illuminated the PLA's fleet and gave the Nationalists clear shots at the former. Later, at about 02:00 when the tide had begun to recede, PLA troops from regiments 244, 251, and 253 landed on the north side of Greater Kinmen Island at Guningtou (Ku-ning-t'ou, ), Huwei (ÊπñÂ∞æ) and Longkou (Â£üÂè£). Regiment 244 was the first ashore landing near Lungkou where Nationalist defenders raked them with machine-gun fire, artillery, and mortars. They suffered heavy casualties. Regiments 251 and 253 fared better, landing near Guningtou and Huwei respectively where they broke through ROC defenses and continued to head inland. Arriving at high tide, many of the PLA landing vessels became caught on submerged anti-amphibious landing beach obstacles and immobilized. When the tide went out, the PLA landing vessels became beached and were unable to return to the mainland to transport the second wave of reinforcements. Although these Communists were initially supported by artillery fire from the mainland, it had to cease firing once the infantry disembarked. Some of the troops, stranded in their vulnerable landing craft still far from shore, had to swim or wade some 650 yards (600 meters) in order to reach the shore, also rendering them without cover and extremely vulnerable to the defenders' fire. The beached PLA vessels were destroyed shortly afterwards by gunfire from two ROC Navy vessels patrolling off the northwest coast of Guningtou, as well as by ROC troops who burned the mostly wooden boats using flamethrowers, grenades, gasoline, and oil. The advancing PLA forces were met by the ROC 18th Army and US-made M5A1 tanks of ROC 1st Bn, 3rd Tank Regiment. PLA Regiment 244 held high ground at Shuangru Hill (Èõô‰π≥Â±±), but were beaten back by ROC armor by early morning. PLA Regiment 253 holding Guanyin Hill (ËßÄÈü≥Â±±) and the Huwei Highlands (ÊπñÂ∞æÈ´òÂú∞) were also forced to fall back by 12:00 after an overwhelming ROC counterattack of infantry, tanks, and soldiers with flamethrowers, and supported by mortars and artillery. The PLA troops were attacked from three sides. PLA Regiment 251 managed to break out of an ROC encirclement and entered the village of Guningtou, and dug in at Lincuo (ÊûóÂéù). Shortly afterwards, Regiment 251 was attacked by the ROC 14th and 118th divisions, with the ROC 118th division suffering heavy casualties. By the end of the day, the PLA had lost its beachheads at Huwei and Lungkou. =October 26= At 03:00 on October 26, around 1,000 troops in 4 companies from PLA Regiment 246 and the 85th division landed on Kinmen to reinforce PLA forces already on the island landing again at Huwei and Guningtou. At dawn, Regiment 246 managed to break through ROC forces surrounding the village of Guningtou, making a rendezvous with the surviving PLA troops taking cover in the town. At 06:30, the ROC 118th division launched a counterattack along the northern coast on PLA forces in Guningtou at Lincuo. The resulting battle was extremely bloody and soon turned into urban warfare in the streets and alleyways of Guningtou. With air support from American-made B-26 and B-25 bombers of the ROC Air Force, ROC forces eventually prevailed, taking Lincuo by noon and Nanshan (ÂçóÂ±±) at 3PM. Surviving PLA forces began falling back to the coast. =October 27= By the early morning of October 27, the surviving People's Liberation Army forces had exhausted both their food and ammunition supplies. 1,300 PLA troops retreated to the beaches north of Guningtou. After a final ROC assault, the remaining PLA troops surrendered to ROC forces at 10:00 on that day. All of the PLA troops who had landed on Kinmen were either killed or captured. Aftermath Battle of Guningtou arch Following the failure at Guningtou, PLA General Ye Fei submitted an official apology to Mao Zedong asking to be punished for his failure. General Ye attributed the failure of the operation to three factors: an insufficient number of landing vessels, failure to properly secure the beachheads, and the lack of an overall commanding officer to oversee the three regiments involved in the first wave. As Ye was one of Mao's favorite generals, Mao never took any action against him. For ROC forces accustomed to continuous defeats against the PLA on the mainland, the victory at Guningtou provided a much-needed morale boost. The failure of the PRC to take Kinmen effectively halted its advance towards Taiwan. With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 and the signing of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty in 1954, the Communist plans to invade Taiwan were put on hold. Due to the PLA's defeat, the Battle of Guningtou was not widely publicized in the PRC until early in the 21st century when the publication of articles within the mainland examining reasons for its failure was widely distributed. The army generally concluded that its lack of amphibious landing experience, lack of sophisticated landing craft, lack of armor, low attack-repelling ability, lack of international recognition, and lack of intelligence services contributed to their defeat. As they had expected to win the battle after one day of fighting, they therefore did not bring enough ammunition, supplies, food, and water, on the first wave and also to a lesser degree during the second day's invasion. The battle is seen as being highly significant in Taiwan, as it laid the foundation for the current status quo relationship between Taiwan and mainland China. Fortuitous ROC defenses at the landing site ROC M5A1 tank with placard reading \\"The Bear of Kinmen\\" The M5A1 tanks employed by the ROC forces on Kinmen proved to be effective in countering the human wave attacks employed by the initial PLA landing forces, which were mostly composed of light infantry. ROC tank crews who had depleted their ammunition used their tanks as road rollers to crush PLA infantry. The pivotal role these tanks played caused ROC troops to give the M5A1 the nickname \\"Bear of Kinmen\\" (ÈáëÈñÄ‰πãÁÜä). The PLA's initial landing force of the 244th regiment at Longkou (Â£üÂè£) was met by three tanks (#64, #65, #66) of the 1st platoon, 3rd company of the ROC 1st Battalion, 3rd Tank Regiment. The #66 tank had broken down on the beach the previous evening after company exercises, and the other two tanks in the platoon had been ordered to stay and guard it while repairs were attempted. Copy of article originally from ËèØÂ§èÁ∂ìÁ∑ØÁ∂≤. An ROC Navy tank landing ship (LST 210, Chung Lung (‰∏≠Ê¶Æ)) was anchored near the PLA's landing site on October 25, and used its significant firepower (2x2 40mm guns, 6x1 40mm guns, 8x1 20mm guns) to destroy beached PLA landing craft, again made up mostly of wooden junks and fishing boats, during the battle. LST 210 was supposed to leave on the evening of October 24 after offloading its cargo, but remained, offering an official excuse of \\"bad weather\\". The unmentioned real reason the ship remained in the area was that it was running a side business of smuggling brown sugar from Taiwan island in exchange for peanut oil. However, there was not enough peanut oil on the whole island for the deal, so the ship was forced to stay for another day while waiting for more peanut oil to be produced, making it the accidental hero of the battle.

He is principally known for his book on agriculture, Opus agriculturae, sometimes known as De re rustica. Biography Since the Middle Ages, authors of agricultural treatises have referred often to Palladius. The Palladii were a prominent Gallic family, and the name Palladius is probably a family name (of Greek origin), with Aemilianus his cognomen (of Roman origin). In Late Antiquity, the convention of the tria nomina (\\"three names\\") for Roman men was no longer standard, and the greater variation in naming practice contributes to the uncertainty over the correct order of his names.Alan Cameron, \\"Polyonomy in the Late Roman Aristocracy: The Case of Petronius Probus,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 75 (1985), pp. 173‚Äì174, citing PLRE II, nos. 4 and 13‚Äì15. Evidence for his life is scant. Manuscripts of his work call him a vir inlustris. Although Palladius relies heavily on earlier agricultural writers, mainly Columella and Gargilius Martialis, he also seems to have some first- hand knowledge of farming in Italy and Sardinia as well as experience as a landowner.R.H. Rodgers, \\"The Moore Palladius,\\" Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society 5.3 (1971), p. 203; Browning, \\"Minor Figures,\\" CHCL, vol. 2, p. 89. Opus agriculturae The Opus agriculturae is a treatise on farming in 14 parts or books, written in the late fourth or early fifth century AD. The first book is general and introductory. Books 2 to 13 give detailed instructions for the typical activities on a Roman farm for each month of the year, starting with January. The fourteenth book, De Veterinaria Medicina, was rediscovered only in the 20th century, and gives instructions for the care of animals and elements of veterinary science. Most of the work is in prose, but the final part, formerly considered to be book 14, De Insitione, on Grafting, consists of eighty-five couplets of elegiac verse. The agricultural writings of Palladius may be compared to those of Marcus Priscus Cato, Marcus Terentius Varro and particularly Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, whose De re rustica appears to have served as a model for Palladius, to such an extent that the Opus agriculturae has been described as an \\"abridgement\\" of Columella. The work of Palladius was well known in the Middle Ages. A translation into Middle English verse survives from about 1420, entitled On Husbondrie; it can be seen as part of a genre of instructional agricultural writing that was to develop in England into works such as those of Thomas Tusser and Gervase Markham. Two notable thirteenth century works that draw on Palladius are the Commoda ruralia of Petrus de Crescentius, written c. 1305 and printed at Augsburg in 1471; and the Speculum Maius of Vincentius Bellovacensis (Vincent de Beauvais) written about 1250 and first printed in Strasbourg in 1473‚Äì76. There are a number of other incunabula or early editions. =Water-mills= sixteen overshot wheels at Barbegal are considered the largest ancient mill complex. Their capacity was sufficient to feed the whole nearby city of Arles The book is known for reference to a water-mill in Book 1, ch. 41, where Palladius suggests that waste water from bath buildings should be used to drive a mill. Such mills had been described by Vitruvius in 25 BC, and there is a growing number of examples of such Roman water-mills. The most spectacular is the set of 16 mills at Barbegal in southern France, using water fed by a stone aqueduct along the line of the same aqueduct which supplied nearby Arles. Principal early editions The earliest editions of Palladius group his works with those on agriculture of Cato the Elder, Varro and Columella.

Background Henfield) Coalpit Heath Cricket Club (see Ram Hill) Due to the expansion of Coalpit Heath and the neighbouring villages in the late 20th century, the borders of Coalpit Heath with Frampton Cotterell have become vague. The village contains three Pubs, one post office, a 27-hole golf course The Kendleshire, and a few local shops. The village also includes a parish church, and a local primary school, The Manor CofE VC Primary school. It was founded as a coal mining settlement. One pit was on Frog Lane at ST 685 815 (to the north east of the village). Other mines operated between Mays Hill and Nibley to the north and at Ram Hill and Henfield to the south.Ordnance survey one-inch map of Great Britain, Sheet 156 Bristol and Stroud, Seventh series 1949, 1963 revision These were served by a railway line, closed some decades ago and no longer visible on the ground. In 1949 the coal ran out, and since then it has become a sought after place to live, with fields and easy accommodation. The South Gloucestershire Mines Research Group (SGMRG) has done a lot of research into the history of mining in the area. When the Kendleshire golf course was built, the remains of many bell pits were found and there are probably many more in the area. Frampton Cotterell lies along the northwest border, but the rest of the village is surrounded by the rolling Cotswold countryside, stocked full of wildlife and country pursuits. St. Saviour's Church lies within the village. It was designed by William Butterfield in 1844 and was his first Anglican Church. Amenities used and supported by the village include Bitterwell Lake at Henfield and Coalpit Heath Cricket Club at Ram Hill. Coalpit Heath in literature A number of sources, including Frank Barrett's book Where Was Wonderland? A Traveller's Guide to the Settings of Classic Children's Books, cite Coalpit Heath as the setting for the Dick King Smith children's book The Sheep-Pig, later adapted for film as Babe. The South Gloucestershire Mines Research Group have written two books (more to be published soon) on Coalpit Heath and the surrounding area. including 'Frog Lane' and 'Kingswood Coal'.

The Chancellery's seat, selected and prepared since 1875, was the former city palace of Prince Antoni Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1775‚Äì1833) on Wilhelmstra√üe in Berlin. Both the palace and a new Reich Chancellery building (completed in early 1939) were seriously damaged during World War II and subsequently demolished. Today the office of the German chancellor is usually called Kanzleramt (Chancellor's Office), or more formally Bundeskanzleramt (Federal Chancellor's Office). The latter is also the name of the new seat of the Chancellor's Office, completed in 2001.  Old Reich Chancellery  When the military alliance of the North German Confederation was reorganised as a federal state with effect from July 1, 1867, the office of a Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler) was implemented at Berlin and staffed with the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck. After the unification of Germany on January 18, 1871 by accession of the South German states, Bismarck became Reich Chancellor of the new German Empire. In 1869 the Prussian state government had acquired the Rococo city palace of late Prince Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç on Wilhelmstra√üe No. 77 (former \\"Palais Schulenburg\\"), which from 1875 was refurbished as the official building of the Chancellery. It was inaugurated with the meetings of the Berlin Congress in July 1878, followed by the Congo Conference in 1884. 1930 extension, view from Wilhelmplatz In the days of the Weimar Republic the Chancellery was significantly enlarged by the construction of a Modern southern annex finished in 1930. In 1932/33, while his nearby office on Wilhelmstra√üe No. 73 was renovated, the building also served as the residence of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg, where he appointed Adolf Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933. The Hitler Cabinet held few meetings here. In 1935 the architects Paul Troost and Leonhard Gall redesigned the interior as Hitler's domicile. They also added a large reception hall/ballroom and conservatory, officially known as the Festsaal mit Wintergarten in the garden area. The latter addition was unique because of the large cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to an air-raid shelter known as the Vorbunker. Once completed in 1936, it was officially called the \\"Reich Chancellery Air-Raid Shelter\\" until 1943, with the construction to expand the bunker complex with the addition of the F√ºhrerbunker, located one level below. The two bunkers were connected by a stairway set at right angles which could be closed off from each other. Devastated by air raids and almost completely destroyed during the Battle of Berlin, the ruins of the Old Reich Chancellery were not cleared until 1950. New Reich Chancellery In late January 1938, Adolf Hitler officially assigned his favourite architect Albert Speer to build the New Reich Chancellery around the corner on Vo√üstra√üe, a western branch-off of Wilhelmstra√üe, requesting that the building be completed within a year. Hitler commented that Bismarck's Old Chancellery was \\"fit for a soap company\\" but not suitable as headquarters of a Greater German Reich. It nevertheless remained his official residence with its recently refurbished representation rooms on the ground floor and private rooms on the upper floor where Hitler lived in the so-called F√ºhrerwohnung (\\"Leader apartment\\"). The Old and New Chancellery shared the large garden area with the underground F√ºhrerbunker, where Hitler committed suicide at the end of April 1945. Speer claimed in his autobiography that he completed the task of clearing the site, designing, constructing, and furnishing the building in less than a year. In fact, preliminary planning and versions of the designs were already being worked on as early as 1935. To clear the space for the New Reich Chancellery, the buildings on the northern side of Vo√üstra√üe No. 2‚Äì10 had already been demolished in 1937. Hitler placed the entire northern side of the Vo√üstra√üe at Speer's disposal assigning him the work of creating grand halls and salons which \\"will make an impression on people\\". Speer was given a blank cheque ‚Äî Hitler stated that the cost of the project was immaterial ‚Äî and was instructed that the building be of solid construction and that it be finished by the following January in time for the next New Year diplomatic reception to be held in the new building. Over 4,000 workers toiled in shifts, so the work could be accomplished round-the-clock. The immense construction was finished 48 hours ahead of schedule, and the project earned Speer a reputation as a good organiser, which, combined with Hitler's fondness for Speer played a part in the architect becoming Armaments Minister and a director of forced labour during the war. Speer recalls that the whole work force ‚Äî masons, carpenters, plumbers, etc. were invited to inspect the finished building. Hitler then addressed the workers in the Sportpalast. However, interior fittings were not finished until the early 1940s. In the end it cost over 90 million Reichsmarks (equivalent to million ‚Ç¨), and hosted the various ministries of the Reich.\\"Who Was Who in Nazi Germany\\" , Nuremberg Trials Project. Harvard University. Retrieved 2 aug 2011 In his memoirs, Speer described the impression of the Reichskanzlei on a visitor: The series of rooms comprising the approach to Hitler's reception gallery were decorated with a rich variety of materials and colours and totalled 221 m (725 ft) in length. The gallery itself was 147.5 m (484 ft) long. Hitler's own office was 400 square meters in size. From the outside, the chancellery had a stern, authoritarian appearance. From the Wilhelmplatz, guests would enter the Chancellery through the Court of Honour (Ehrenhof). The building's main entrance was flanked by two bronze statues by sculptor Arno Breker: \\"Wehrmacht\\" and \\"Die Partei\\" (\\"Armed Forces\\" and \\"The Party\\"). Hitler is said to have been greatly impressed by the building and was uncharacteristically free in his praise for Speer, lauding the architect as a \\"genius\\". The chancellor's great study was a particular favourite of the dictator. The big marble-topped table served as an important part of the Nazi leader's military headquarters, the study being used for military conferences from 1944 on. On the other hand, the Cabinet room was never used for its intended purpose. The New Reich Chancellery suffered severe damage during the Battle of Berlin between April to May 1945 (in comparison, the Old Reich Chancellery was not as badly destroyed). Andrei Gromyko, who would later become the Soviet foreign minister, visited the partially-destroyed grand structure a few weeks after the fighting in the city had completely ceased. He recalls, \\"We reached it not without difficulties. Ruined edifices, formless heaps of metal and ferro-concrete encumbered the way. To the very entrance of the Chancellery, the car could not approach. We had to reach it on foot...\\" He noted the New Reich Chancellery \\"...was almost destroyed... Only the walls remained, riddled by countless shrapnel, yawning by big shot-holes from shells. Ceilings survived only partly. Windows loomed black by emptiness.\\" The last stage of defense by defending German troops took place inside the Reich Chancellery, as mentioned by Gromyko, who stated the following: After World War II in Europe ended, the remains in what was then East Berlin (the Soviet- occupied sector of a divided Berlin) were demolished by the order of the Soviet occupation forces. Parts of the building's marble walls were rumoured to be used in the building of the Soviet war memorial located in Treptower Park (also in East Berlin then) or to renovate and repair the nearby war- damaged Mohrenstra√üe U-Bahn subway station. Petrographic analyzes of materials used for construction there did not confirm those rumours.

Harrassowitz Verlag, Wiesbaden 2005, . Some of the so-called \\"red marble\\" (actually limestone) obtained from the demolition of the New Reich Chancellery was also supposedly used in the construction of the Moscow Metro's palatial-style subway stations after the war. Also, it is alleged that a heater from one of Hitler's rooms was placed in a Protestant hospital located not too far away from the Reich Chancellery.Architektur der Angst einestages ‚Äì Zeitgeschichten auf Spiegel Online While the western half of the premises were taken over by the East German government for the establishment of the so- called \\"Death-Strip\\" of the Berlin Wall in 1961 (when the barrier was being constructed), a Plattenbau apartment block, together with a kindergarten, was built on the eastern half (along Wilhelmstra√üe) during the 1980s.

It is the oldest extant manuscript in Irish. It is held in the Royal Irish Academy and is badly damaged: only 67 leaves remain and many of the texts are incomplete. It is named after an anachronistic legend that it was made from the hide of a dun cow by Saint Ciar√°n of Clonmacnoise. History The manuscript is thought to be the work of three scribes, whose handwriting was distinguished by Richard Irvine Best in 1912 and identified with the letters A, M and H.R. I. Best, \\"Notes on the Script of Lebor na hUidre\\", √âriu 6, 1912, pp. 161‚Äì174 A and M are believed to be contemporary. A began the manuscript and wrote the opening pages of several of the texts, which were continued by M, who Best identified as M√°el Muire mac C√©ilechair meic Cuinn na mBocht, based on matching the handwriting with two marginal probationes pennae or pen tests, in which the scribe wrote his name. A much later note elsewhere in the manuscript names M√°el Muire as the person who \\"wrote and compiled this book from divers[e] books\\". His murder by Vikings at Clonmacnoise is recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters in 1106,Annals of the Four Masters M1106.7 giving us a latest possible date and location for the main body of the manuscript. Some time later, H (named for his addition of two homilies) added a number of new texts and passages, sometimes over erased portions of the original, sometimes on new leaves. Based on orthography and an English loanword, Gear√≥id Mac Eoin concludes that H wrote in the late 12th or early 13th century.Gear√≥id Mac Eoin, \\"The Interpolator H in Lebor na hUidre\\", Ulidia, December Publications, 1994, pp. 39‚Äì46. After the monastery of Clonmacnoise was broken up, the manuscript came into the possession of the O'Donnell dynasty of Donegal who held it until 1359, when it and the lost Leabhar Gearr were used to ransom members of the clan who had been taken prisoner by Cathal √ìg √ì Conchobhair Sligigh (d. 3 November 1362). √Åed Ruad O'Donnell recovered the manuscript in 1470, and it remained in Donegal at least until 1631, when the compilation of the Annals of the Four Masters was completed. Its location is unknown until 1837, when it was part of a collection owned by Messrs. Hodges & Smith of College Green, Dublin, and was cited by George Petrie in an essay on the History and Antiquities of Tara Hill. The Hodges & Smith collection, 227 manuscripts in all, was purchased by the Royal Irish Academy in 1844.R.

His name literally means \\"arrival of the great strength\\". MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta is one of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism, along with Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, Samantabhadra, Avalokite≈õvara, ƒÄkƒÅ≈õagarbha, K·π£itigarbha, Maitreya and Sarvanivarana-Vishkambhin. In Chinese Buddhism, he is usually portrayed as a womanhttp://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Mahasthamaprapta_(Shih_Chih,_Seishi), with a likeness similar to Avalokite≈õvara. He is also one of the Thirteen Buddhas in the Japanese school of Shingon Buddhism. In Tibetan Buddhism, MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta is equated with Vajrapani, who is one of his incarnations and was known as the Protector of Gautama Buddha. MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta is one of the oldest bodhisattvas and is regarded as powerful, especially in the Pure Land school, where he takes an important role in the Longer SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha S≈´tra. He is often depicted in a trinity with AmitƒÅbha and Avalokite≈õvara (Guanyin), especially in Pure Land Buddhism. In the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra, MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta tells of how he gained enlightenment through the practice of nianfo, or continuous pure mindfulness of AmitƒÅbha, to obtain samƒÅdhi. In the Amitayurdhyana Sutra, MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta is symbolized by the moon while Avalokite≈õvara is represented by the sun.http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Mahasthamaprapta_(Shih_Chih,_Seishi) In the Introductory chapter of the Lotus Sutra, MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta is present among the 80,000 bodhisattva mahƒÅsattvas who assemble on Mount G·πõdhrak≈´·π≠a to hear the Buddha's preaching of the Wonderful Dharma of the Lotus Flower Sutra. The Buddha also addresses MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta in chapter 20 of the Lotus Sutra to tell of the Buddha's past life as the Bodhisattva SadƒÅparibh≈´ta (\\"Never Despising\\"), a monk who was abused and reviled by arrogant monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen when he paid them respect by saying they would all become Buddhas. The Buddha explains to MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta how these arrogant people were punished, but are now bodhisattvas present in the assembly on the path to Enlightenment. The Buddha then praises the great strength of the Lotus Sutra thus: ‚ÄúO MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta, know that this Lotus Sutra will greatly benefit the bodhisattva mahƒÅsattvas and lead them to highest, complete enlightenment. For this reason, after the TathƒÅgata‚Äôs parinirvƒÅ·πáa the bodhisattva mahƒÅsattvas should always preserve, recite, explain, and copy this sutra.‚Äù China Y√¨nguƒÅng (), a teacher of Pure Land Buddhism, was widely considered to be a manifestation of MahƒÅsthƒÅmaprƒÅpta based on the accounts of two people: 1.

Located on an ancient east‚Äìwest trail in the western part of the state, the monument preserves the remains of a large prehistoric pueblo atop a great sandstone promontory with a pool of water at its base, which subsequently became a landmark where many centuries of explorers and travelers left historic inscriptions that survive today. Between about 1275 to 1350 AD, up to 1,500 people of the Ancestral Puebloan culture lived in the 875-room mesa-top pueblo. The village was situated on the old Zuni-Acoma Trail, an important prehistoric trade route. Spanish explorers visiting the area in the 16th century referred to the notable promontory as El Morro (\\"The Headland\\"); the local Zuni Indians call it A'ts'ina (\\"Place of writings on the rock\\"), and early Anglo-Americans called it Inscription Rock. With its oasis- like source of water, El Morro served as a stopping place for numerous travelers through the otherwise arid and desolate region, many of whom left signatures, names, dates, and stories of their treks in the walls of the sandstone cliff. While some of the inscriptions are fading, there are still many that can be seen today, with some dating to the 17th century. The oldest historic inscription at El Morro, left by Juan de O√±ate, the first Spanish governor of the colony of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, is dated April 16, 1605. Among the Anglo-American emigrants who left their names there in 1858 were several members of the Rose-Baley Party, including Leonard Rose and John Udell.Weigle, Marta and White, Peter (2003). The Lore of New Mexico, p. 56. University of New Mexico Press Nearby petroglyphs and carvings made by the Ancestral Puebloans were inscribed centuries before Europeans arrived. In 1906, U.S. federal law prohibited further carving on the cliffs. El Morro was designated a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 8, 1906, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Today the site is managed by the National Park Service. The many inscription panels, water pool, pueblo ruins, and the top of the promontory are all accessible via park trails. El Morro is one of many prehistoric sites on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, a designated New Mexico Scenic Byway.Trail of the Ancients. New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved August 14, 2014.

He is also an internationally respected brass teacher and designer of brass mutes and mouthpieces. On retirement in 1989 he was awarded the International Trombone Association's annual award; he served as their president 2004‚Äì2006. Denis Wick (left) in conversation with fellow LSO member George Reynolds, 2001. Wick was born in Braintree, Essex and attended King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford, and Luton Grammar School. He taught himself the trombone from the age of 10 when he received an instrument from the Chelmsford Salvation Army band. He played with the band until the age of 15 and soon joined Luton Brass Band which was enjoying considerable national success at the time. At the age of 16 he heard his first orchestral concert, and Malcolm Arnold's trumpet playing so inspired him that he decided to pursue a career in playing. Because his family was not well off, his mother worked to fund his studies. He spent a year at the Royal Academy of Music from 1950, but claims he was frustrated with not learning anything there. Sid Langston was the professor, but he all but refused to pass on any of his experience in case his students 'stole' his work. Wick did an amateur date in Salisbury and by chance the other trombonists were from the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, so when the 2nd trombone job came up in July 1950, they called to invite him to audition, having already heard many of the final year students at the London music colleges. Wick won this audition and entered this large full-time professional orchestra at the age of 19. He went on to win an audition with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 1952, a year after conductor Rudolf Schwarz had moved there. The audition had to be rigorous to persuade the administrators that Schwarz was not practising favouritism towards an ex- colleague from the BSO. In Birmingham in 1955 Wick worked with Gordon Jacob in premiering the famous trombone concerto. This piece shows off the advances in technique that he was making: the cadenza in the last movement makes great use of warm-up and flexibility studies that Wick had developed and would prove hugely influential in the teaching of brass players in Britain to this day. He held the position of principal trombone at the London Symphony Orchestra from 1957‚Äì1988. He was the principal trombonist in the London Symphony Orchestra when it recorded John William's arrangement of the opening title for Stars Wars. The brass playing in the Star Wars films has encouraged a whole generation of brass players, Wick making a blistering sound in partnership with Maurice Murphy, on 1st trumpet. Another recording where Wick made his mark is in the large solo in the 1970 LSO/Horenstein (Unicorn) recording of Mahler's Third Symphony. Soon after moving to the LSO, Wick moved the LSO section from .485\\" bore Boosey Imperial tenor trombones and a .523\\" G bass trombone to the American \\"large bore\\" instruments (.547\\" tenor and slightly larger bass, now in B‚ô≠). Experimentation possibly started in Birmingham, and the Jacob Concerto suits the larger sound, but post-war import restrictions made these instruments impossible to obtain legally before 1958. Certainly he was a pioneer in Britain, and soon all the other orchestral players followed suit. Wick taught initially at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (1967‚Äì1989) and since 2000 has served on the faculty at the Royal Academy of Music, London. He was conductor of the Second Essex Youth Orchestra in the late 1980s‚Äì1990s. He has also worked with the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra since 1993. He has his own line of mouthpieces and mutes for brass instruments, made by Denis Wick Products Ltd, and owns Denis Wick Publishing. He has been honoured by the International Trombone Association several times. In 1989 he was awarded the ITA Award, presented each year to an individual who has greatly influenced the field of trombone. In 2006 he was presented with the Neill Humfeld Award, which recognises outstanding trombone teaching. During his Presidency of the ITA 2004‚Äì2006 he brought the International Trombone Festival to Birmingham, and made great strides to internationalise the ITA magazine.

FirstGroup completed the acquisition of Laidlaw International on October 1, 2007, and rebranded Laidlaw services under the First umbrella. The deal combined North America‚Äôs two largest private school bus operators‚ÄîEducation Services and First Student Inc.‚Äîgiving them a combined 40% of the school bus contractor market.School Bus Fleet Laidlaw had grown primarily through acquisitions of other companies and contracting of services formerly directly provided by government entities. It was the parent company of Laidlaw Transit (which was merged into First Transit), Laidlaw Education Services (merged into First Student), Greyhound Lines and Greyhound Lines of Canada, and a number of Gray Line Sightseeing franchises in major North American cities. In acquiring Laidlaw, FirstGroup announced that the Laidlaw name would not be kept, but that the Greyhound name would be maintained.  History  Laidlaw began in 1924 when founder Robert Laidlaw created Laidlaw Transit, a trucking service company in Hagersville, Ontario. Beginning in 1972, under the leadership of Michael DeGroote, Laidlaw, Inc. began growing through acquisitions of other companies when it acquired a Canadian intercity and charter bus company. In 1979, it acquired a Canadian contract school bus business. In 1978 it entered the U.S. solid waste industry. In 1983, Laidlaw entered the U.S. school bus transportation sector with its acquisition of ARA Transportation, a major contract school bus provider which also owned a Wayne Corporation bus dealership. In 1984, Laidlaw Inc. exited the trucking business, as the company began a consolidating smaller school bus contracting companies in the U.S. and Canada. In 1988, Laidlaw, Inc. purchased a controlling interest in itself from Canadian Pacific Limited, parent of Canadian Pacific Railway. Instances of reverse privatization were rare, but did occur during Laidlaw's years of expansion. In Virginia, several school districts canceled their school bus contracts with private operators and brought bus operations in-house. By the late 1980s, the only 3 remaining district school bus contracts were at Petersburg, Norfolk and Hopewell. Self-operation conversions for all three were urged by Virginia Department of Education officials as \\"cost-saving.\\" The contracting companies unsuccessfully disputed the state's financial calculations and cost allocations for the reverse privatizations, which effectively ended all public school bus contracting in Virginia by 1996. In 1991, after losing its major school bus contract in Norfolk, Virginia to a governmental conversion to district-self-operation, Laidlaw sold the rest of its urban-suburban bus line, school bus contracting business serving independent schools and day camps, and related assets in the Norfolk area to Virginia Overland Transportation. Virginia Overland Transportation was an operator of public service transportation and a much smaller industry consolidator in the state. The company had also lost their contract in Petersburg to self-operation in 1989, but was still operating at Hopewell. The latter converted in 1996, and Virginia Overland's parent company based in Richmond closed in 2004. The former Virginia Overland subsidiary operation in the Norfolk area acquired from Laidlaw operates as Transquest and is now owned by Serco. As of 2007, Transquest was continuing bus contract operations transporting students to many independent schools in South Hampton Roads, including Norfolk Academy. In the 1990s, Laidlaw continued to acquire hundreds of smaller school bus and public transit contractors in the U.S. and Canada. These also included major competitors, including Mayflower Contract Services in 1995, and National Bus Service in 1996.Other News In 1993, Laidlaw acquired San Diego based MedTrans, a high quality industry leader which began as Harrison Ambulance in San Diego, operating emergency medical services operating in California, Washington, Nevada and Texas, and continued to grow it through 138 acquisitions across the country, reaching over $1B in revenue. Glen Roberts was the MedTrans CEO and Donald Jones, COO, at the time of the Laidlaw acquisition. In 1998, the company acquired American Medical Response, another nationwide U.S. ambulance service provider and CareLine, Inc., U.S. ambulance consolidator of smaller ambulance contractors. In 1996, Laidlaw sold its solid waste business to Allied Waste Industries. Allied Waste sold the Canadian operations to USA Waste Services, Inc. Laidlaw American branches were re-branded to many different names, depending on their location. In 1998, a watershed year, Laidlaw Inc. acquired Greyhound Lines U.S. operations, Greyhound Canada, the DAVE Companies (specialists in paratransit) and emergency management companies EmCare and Spectrum Emergency Care. After incurring heavy losses through its investments in Safety-Kleen and Greyhound Lines and after almost 20 years of expansion, Laidlaw Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2001. Laidlaw International, Inc. listed its common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (Ticker: LI), on February 10, 2004, and emerged from reorganization on June 23, 2003 as the successor to Laidlaw Inc. Canadian Pacific sold its remaining 17% interest in Laidlaw Inc. The company later sold American Medical Response and EmCare, its EMS contract operations, to new owners.

The McKeen Motor Car Company of Omaha, Nebraska, was a builder of internal combustion-engined railroad motor cars (railcars), constructing 152 between 1905‚Äì1917. Founded by William McKeen, the Union Pacific Railroad's Superintendent of Motive Power and Machinery, the company was essentially an offshoot of the Union Pacific and the first cars were constructed by the UP before McKeen leased shop space in the UP's Omaha Shops in Omaha, Nebraska. The UP had asked him to develop a way of running small passenger trains more economically and McKeen produced a design that was ahead of its time. Unfortunately, internal combustion engine technology was not and the McKeen cars never found a truly reliable powerplant. The vast majority of the cars produced were for E. H. Harriman's empire of lines (Union Pacific, Southern Pacific and others). Harriman's death in 1909 lost the company its major sponsor and investor and Harriman's successors were less enthusiastic about the McKeen cars. Many McKeen cars ended up being re-engined with a variety of drive mechanisms ‚Äî gasoline- mechanical, gasoline-electric, diesel-electric or even steam power. Most, although not all, McKeen cars had the distinctive \\"wind-splitter\\" pointed aerodynamic front end and rounded tail. The porthole windows were also a McKeen trademark, adopted allegedly for strength after the 7th production car. A dropped central door, as pictured, was also present on the majority of the cars. Two lengths, 55 and 70 feet, were offered; either could be fitted out with a large mail and express area ahead of the center doors, a smaller mail/express area, or the car could be all seats for a maximum capacity of 64 or 105 respectively. Interior of a McKeen car. History Anatomy of a McKeen car =Carbody= Motor truck with engine =Engine= Originally, McKeen cars used engines from the Standard Motor Works of Jersey City, New Jersey, but switched to an engine of their own design from the eighth car produced, M8 on the Union Pacific. All engines were straight-6 in configuration, of power ratings between on the first car (M1) and a maximum of on the most powerful later cars. The cylinders were vertical and the engine mounted transversely across the car in all McKeen cars and locomotives produced. All engines were equipped to be run in either direction, as is not uncommon with marine engines; there was no reverse gear. To run in reverse, the engine had to be stopped, the camshaft shifted by the motorman to the reverse cam set and the engine restarted in reverse. Starting was by compressed air. Side elevation of motor truck; larger wheel on right is the front. =Motor truck= The lead truck of the car was the powered truck; the engine was rigidly mounted atop this truck and moved with it when it turned. Only the front axle was powered (via a chain drive) a design decision which contributed to the car's poor adhesion characteristics. The front wheelset had a 42-inch diameter, while the three other wheelsets were 33-inch diameter. =Interior= McKeen cars were generally wood-panelled on the interior and fitted with transverse bench seats with a central aisle. The rounded rear was fitted with a semi-circular bench seat. Lighting was originally acetylene. Problems with McKeen cars Most of the problems experienced with McKeen cars involved the powerplant and drivetrain. As with many other attempts to bring marine engine technology to the rails, engines that were reliable on the stable platform of a ship when attended to by experienced technicians and operators proved less so when exposed to the vibration, indifferent maintenance and less careful handling they found on the railroad. Starting the engine was a problem on the early cars; with no independently powered compressor, the compressed-air starting relied on the limited reserves of the car's reservoirs. There were many reports of cars being started by being pushed or towed by locomotives or even horses, after the compressed air ran out. Later cars, with an independent gasoline-driven compressor which could be hand-started, did not suffer from these problems. The lack of a reverse gear also caused problems. The engine had to be stopped, the camshaft shifted to a set of reverse cams and then started in the opposite direction. This was acceptable shipboard, perhaps, but deeply disliked by railroad operators. Accounts exist of engineers' elaborate schemes for avoiding the necessity to reverse. The transmission was a common problem; a clutch did not seem to exist which combined the ability to withstand on a regular basis with the ability to give a smooth start. Clutch failures were commonplace. Competitor GE's cars used an electric transmission and that or a hydraulic torque converter have been used on the vast majority of successful internal combustion-engined rail vehicles since. Many operators found the McKeen car to be lacking in power and traction, the latter unsurprising since only one of four axles was powered. Unusual McKeen products The vast majority of McKeen products followed the pattern set out above, but some unusual ones were also rolled out. McKeen car of the Victorian Railways at Wodonga, c.1912. =Victorian Railways cars= The Victorian Railways, the government-run system of the state of Victoria in Australia, ordered two McKeen cars in 1911, these being delivered in 1912. These were the only broad-gauge cars, built to the VR gauge of . They were fitted with buffers and hook and chain couplers, and were built with the rounded-nose body type, rather than knife-nosed. Since VR stations uniformly had car-level platforms, the usual dropped entranceway was instead raised into the roof. McKeen car of the Queensland Railways. =Queensland Railways cars= In 1911, the Queensland Railways of the state of Queensland, Australia, ordered five McKeen cars which were delivered in May 1913. These were to the QR gauge of , and were the only narrow gauge McKeen cars. They were issued running numbers 1 through 5. Like the Victorian Railways cars, the cars were fitted with the more rounded nose and with buffers; however, the typical McKeen dropped center door was retained to permit easy passenger access without a raised platform. The cars, unlike most, had the same size of wheels on both axles of the lead truck and a chain drive linking them, making all 4 wheels driven. These cars were approximately long and originally seated 75; this was soon reduced to 69 by dividing the car into a non-smoking section (seating 55) and a smoking section (seating 14). The five cars were based at Woolloongabba for most of their lives, and handled services to the Brisbane suburbs of Corinda and Sunnybank as well as between Manly and Cleveland. The cars proved no more reliable in Queensland than elsewhere; by 1920 car No.1 was out of service and cars Nos. 2 and 5 were modified as Tourist and Day Inspection cars, with luxury accommodations for 32 passengers. They were still expensive to run, at an estimated double the running costs of a steam-hauled train; the Great Depression finished them off, and the five cars were withdrawn between 1929 and 1931 and scrapped at QR's Ipswich shops. =Southern Utah Railroad #100= The Southern Utah Railroad took possession in 1916 of the most powerful McKeen motor car ever produced, with a six-wheel leading truck.Keilty (1979) p.54 Two of the three axles in that truck were powered, connected by side rods; the engine developed . Unlike most McKeen cars, it had a rounded front end instead of the knife-edge prow normally favored; it also featured roof-mounted radiators in addition to those in the normal location behind the pilot. Despite the extra power, this was only a car with a capacity of 48 passengers. The additional power was needed for the severe grades (max. 4.92%) and curvature of the line between Price and Hiawatha for which it was intended. The car was apparently not a success and did not last long in service, being withdrawn from service in June 1917 and dismantled, the engine and power truck being sold. The carbody was used as a shop employee locker room at Martin until it was dismantled in 1990. In the mid '90s the dismantled #100 was then purchased by a ranch owner in Utah. There, he cut it in half at the vestibule and used the rail car as two separate storage units. In 2015, the two halves were then traded for two sea containers by Bently enterprises LLC. It was then moved to Minden, Nevada and is undergoing restoration. =Locomotives= The company produced at least one gasoline-engined locomotive. A locomotive was produced in about 1913 and worked around the company shops in Omaha; A locomotive (probably the same one) was tested in the UP's Aspen Tunnel. A locomotive, numbered 5 but possibly again the same one, was documented in the contemporary trade press, photos of which are below. It is described as being of 0-4-2 wheel arrangement, with the engine mounted across the car as normal and driving the rearmost driving axle in the normal McKeen fashion. Siderods transferred the drive to the other pair of driven wheels. The arrangement was largely identical to the three-axle lead truck on the unique Southern Utah Railway McKeen car. Zeitler documents this locomotive as having a tractive effort of . The frame was cast steel, and the superstructure constructed of steel, with sufficient solidity to add structural strength; the horizontal cast steel engine bed was also described as a structural member. The straight-6 engine had an bore and stroke, for a total displacement of ; it developed . Image:McKeen Gasoline Switching Locomotive.jpgLocomotive, lettered for \\"McKeen Locomotive\\" and numbered \\"5\\". Image:McKeen Gasoline Locomotive Drawing.jpgGeneral arrangement drawing Schopp documents that a locomotive was sold to the Motley County Railroad in 1915, and speculates that this may also have been the same single locomotive. In the same article, he recounts a locomotive reported as being stored at the Omaha shops in 1917 that may have been the same locomotive once more. Another McKeen locomotive was created by the Charles City Western Railway of Iowa by building a wooden boxcab superstructure atop a McKeen power truck. Surviving McKeen products An example is preserved at the Nevada State Railroad Museum. This car ran on the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. It has been fully rebuilt. As of September 2010, it runs on special events. The Nevada State Railroad Museum has restored a full McKeen car, Virginia and Truckee Railway Motor Car 22, a 1910-built 70 foot car. This was one of the last McKeen cars to be still running with its original motor. It made its last run in September 1945 and its body was sold in 1946 for service as a roadside diner, later to be used for a plumbing supply store in Carson City, Nevada. Donated to the Museum in 1996, its first run was on May 9, 2010, the car's hundredth anniversary of construction. The original powerplant did not survive and no other McKeen engines could be located. Consequently, a modern diesel engine was fitted to allow the car to operate up to the original maximum speed. The fully restored McKeen motorcar was put back into operation on May 9, 2010, right on schedule for its 100th anniversary of its construction. The motorcar is now being used at the Nevada State Railroad Museum In Carson City Nevada for special occasions such as Independence Day and Nevada Day The NSRM also owns the remains of a second McKeen car which was converted into a diesel-electric switching locomotive. Another McKeen body, construction number 83/103, survives in Romona, California. It originally belonged to the San Diego Cuyamaca & Eastern Railroad then was later sold to the Yuma Valley Railroad before arriving in Alaska around 1921, being re-engined and round-nosed in 1924, converted to an unpowered trailer in 1935 and finally retired in the late 1940s after serving in the 714th Railway Battalion during WWII. The car, originally named the \\"Cuyamaca\\", is now undergoing restoration by Madison Kirkman of the McKeen Motor Car Company Historical Society. Two unpowered McKeen trailers survive; one is a storage shed in St. Helena, California. while the other is at the Illinois Railway Museum.

It is part of the Sundarbans on the Ganges Delta, and adjacent to the Sundarban Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. The delta is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and invertebrate species, including the salt-water crocodile. The present Sundarban National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarban Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a national park. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed in 1987, and it has been designated as a Ramsar site since 2019. It is considered as a World Network of Biosphere Reserve (Man and Biosphere Reserve) from 1989. The first forest management division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as reserved forests under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department. A forest division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893‚Äì1898.UNDP (1998). Integrated resource development of the Sundarbans Reserved Forests, Bangladesh. Volume I Project BGD/84/056, United Nations Development Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Dhaka, The People's Republic of Bangladesh. In 1911, it was described as a tract of unexamined waste country and was excluded from the census. It then stretched for about from the mouth of the Hugli to the mouth of the Meghna river and was bordered inland by the three settled districts of the 24 parganas, Khulna and Bakerganj. The total area (including water) was estimated at . It was a water-logged jungle, in which tigers and other wild beasts abounded. Attempts at reclamation had not been very successful. The Sundarbans was everywhere intersected by river channels and creeks, some of which afforded water communication throughout the Bengal region both for steamers and for native ships. The maximum part of the delta is located in Bangladesh.  Administration  reserve forest. The Directorate of Forest is responsible for the administration and management of the Sundarbans. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Wildlife & Bio-Diversity & ex- officio Chief Wildlife Warden, West Bengal, is the senior most executive officer looking over the administration of the park. The Chief Conservator of Forests (South) & Director, Sundarban Biosphere Reserve is the administrative head of the park at the local level and is assisted by a deputy field director and an assistant field director. The park area is divided into two ranges, overseen by range forest officers. Each range is further sub-divided into beats. The park also has floating watch stations and camps to protect the property from poachers. The park receives financial aid from the state government as well as the Ministry of Environment and Forests under various plan and non-plan budgets. Additional funding is received under the Project Tiger from the Central Government. In 2001, a grant of US$20,000 was received as preparatory assistance for promotion between India and Bangladesh from the World Heritage Fund. Geography The Sundarban National Park is located between 21¬∞ 432‚Ä≤ ‚Äì 21¬∞ 55‚Ä≤ N latitude and between 88¬∞ 42‚Ä≤ ‚Äì 89¬∞ 04‚Ä≤ E longitude. The average altitude of the park is 7.5 m above sea level. The park is composed of 54 small islands and intersected by several distributaries of the Ganges river. = Climate = The average minimum and maximum temperature is 20 ¬∞C and 48 ¬∞C respectively. Rainfall is heavy with humidity as high as 80% as it is close to the Bay of Bengal. The monsoon lasts from mid-June to mid-September. Prevailing wind is from the north and north-east from October to mid-March and southwest westerlies prevails from mid-March to September. Storms which sometimes develop into cyclones are common during the months of May to October. =Eco-geography, rivers and watercourses= Seven main rivers and innumerable watercourses form a network of channels at this estuarine delta. All the rivers have a southward course towards the sea. The eco- geography of this area is totally dependent on the tidal effect of two flow tides and two ebb tides occurring within 24 hours with a tidal range of 3‚Äì5 m and up to 8 m in normal spring tide, inundating the whole of Sundarban in varying depths. The tidal action deposits silts back on the channels and raising the bed, it forms new islands and creeks contributing to uncertain geomorphology. There is a great natural depression called the Swatch of No Ground in the Bay of Bengal between 21¬∞00' to 21¬∞22' latitude where the depth of water changes suddenly from 20 m to 500 m. This mysterious depression pushes back the silts towards south and/or further east to form new islands. Mangrove trees in Sundarban and a small creek going inside the forest =Mudflats= The Sunderban mudflats are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The interior parts of the mudflats are the right environment for mangroves. There are a number of mudflats outside the Sundarbans National Park is a mudflat that have the potential to be tourist spots in the Sundarbans. One can visit them and enjoy the beauty of the place during low tide. If one is lucky, one can see sea anemones, horseshoe crab (Nearing extinction)and small octopus. =Flora and fauna= mangrove date palms. The coastal active delta of Sunderban at the mouth of Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh, having a complex geomorphologic and hydrological character with climatic hazards, has a vast area of mangrove forests with a variety of flora and diverse fauna in a unique ecosystem. The natural environment and coastal ecosystem of this Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site is under threat of physical disaster due to unscientific and excessive human interferences. Conservation and environmental management plan for safeguarding this unique coastal ecology and ecosystem is urgently required. Flora Sundarban has achieved its name from the Sundari tree. It is the most exquisite variety of tree that are found in this area, a special kind of mangrove tree. It has specialised roots called pneumatophores which emerge above ground and help in gaseous exchange i.e. respiration. During the rainy season when the entire forest is waterlogged, the spikes rising from the ground has their peak in the air and helps in the respiration process. Fauna The Sundarbans forest is home to more than 400 tigers. The royal Bengal tigers have developed a unique characteristic of swimming in the saline waters, and are famous for their man-eating tendencies. Tigers can be seen on the river banks sunbathing between November and February. Apart from the Bengal tiger, fishing cats, leopard cats, macaques, wild boar, Indian grey mongoose, fox, jungle cat, flying fox, chital, are also found in abundance in the Sundarbans. A royal Bengal tiger in its natural habitat at sundarban =Avifauna= Some of the birds commonly found in this region are openbill storks, black-capped kingfishers, black-headed ibis, water hens, coots, pheasant-tailed jacanas, pariah kites, brahminy kite, marsh harriers, swamp partridges, red junglefowl, spotted doves, common mynahs, jungle crows, jungle babblers, cotton teals, herring gulls, Caspian terns, gray herons, common snipes, wood sandpipers, green pigeons, rose ringed parakeets, paradise-flycatchers, cormorants, grey-headed fish eagles, white-bellied sea eagles, seagulls, common kingfishers, peregrine falcons, woodpeckers, Eurasian whimbrels, black-tailed godwits, little stints, eastern knots, curlews, golden plovers, northern pintails, white-eyed pochards and whistling teals. =Aquatic fauna= Some of the aquatic animals found in the park are sawfish, butter fish, electric rays, silver carp, starfish, common carp, horseshoe crabs, prawn, shrimps, Gangetic dolphins, skipping frogs, common toads and tree frogs. =Reptiles= Salt-water crocodile at Sundarbans Salt-water crocodile The Sundarbans National Park houses a large number of reptiles as well, including estuarine crocodiles, chameleons, monitor lizards, turtles, including olive ridley, hawksbill, and green turtles, and snakes, including python, king cobra, rat snake, Russell's viper, dog faced water snake, checkered keelback, red tailed bamboo pit viper and common krait =Endangered species= The endangered species that lives within the Sundarbans are royal Bengal tiger, saltwater crocodile, river terrapin, olive ridley turtle, Ganges river dolphin, hawksbill turtle and mangrove horseshoe crab. =Marine mammals= The proposed Sundarbans Cetacean Diversity Protected Area,Sundarbans, Bay Of Bengal. whales.org includes the coastal waters off Sundarbans that host critical habitats for endangered cetaceans;Whale and Dolphins Of Sundarban. youtube.com resident groups of Bryde's whales, a newly rediscovered critical population of Irrawaddy dolphins,Lawson, Alastair (10 April 2009) Bangladesh dolphins 'back from dead'.

Proposal to establish a marine protected area in the Swatch-of-No-Ground submarine canyon and surrounding coastal waters in the Bay of Bengal (pdf). Retrieved March 2, 2017 Management and special projects Patrolling boat in Sundarbans The Bengal tiger is the commonly found species in the park. Having protection since its creation, the core area is free from all human disturbances such as collection of wood, honey, fishing, and other forest products. However, in the buffer area, these activities are permitted in limited form. The forest staff, using motorboats and launches, protect the park from illegal poaching and theft. Forest offices and camps are located at several important parts of the park. Under the supervision of a range officer, two or three experienced workers manage anti-poaching camps. Habitat of wildlife is maintained through eco-conservation, eco-development, training, education and research. Ten Forest Protection Committees and 14 Eco-development Committees have been formed in the fringe of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve to help in this regard. Seminars, workshops and awareness camps are organised in the vicinity of park to educate the people on eco-conservation, eco-development, and such other issues. Mangrove and other plants are planted in the fringe area to meet the local need of fuel wood for about 1000 villages and to conserve the buffer area. Conservation of soil is done to maintain the ecological balance. Several sweet water ponds have been dug up inside the park to provide drinking water for the wild animals. Controlling man-eating tigers is another major activity. The number of casualties has been reduced from 40 to 10 per year. The reduction in number of casualties is a result of strict control over the movement of the people inside the tiger reserve, alternative income generation and awareness building among people. It is also believed that due to use of human masks and electric human dummies the tigers will stay away from the people. Straying of tigers into nearby villages is prevented through measures such as nylon net fencing and solar illumination of villages. The youths of the villages are given training in controlling the straying of tigers into the villages. The Mangrove Interpretation Centre is established at Sajnekhali to make the local people and tourists aware of the importance of conservation of nature in general and specially the mangrove ecosystems. =Constraints= Though protection exists in the park, there are a few loopholes. The geographical topography with hostile terrain cris-crossed by several rivers and their tributaries, long international border with Bangladesh, fishing trawlers and launches enables poaching and the cutting of wood, affecting the mangrove forests. Lack of staff, infrastructure and lack of funds exacerbate the situation. Park-specific information Entry to Dobanki Camp The only means of travelling the park is to by boat, down the various lanes formed by the many flowing rivers. Local boats or vessels operated by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation, namely M.V. Chitrarekha and M.V. Sarbajaya. Accommodation on land and cruise safaris are provided by Sunderban Tiger Camp, the only government-approved resort in the region. They conduct fixed departures and private tours from Kolkata throughout the year. Closed jetty of Sundhanyakhali Apart from viewing the wildlife from boat safaris, visitors also visit the Sudhanyakali watchtower,Dobanki Watch Tower,Buridabri Watch Tower, Netidhopani Watch Tower, Sajnekhali Bird Sanctuary, Bhagatpur Crocodile Project, a crocodile breeding farm, Sagar Island, Jambudweep, Haliday Island, and Kanak.  Sunderban Tiger Reserve  =Background= The Sunderban Tiger Reserve is located in the South 24 Paraganas district of the Indian state of West Bengal, and has a total geographical area of 2585 km2, with 1437.4 km2 consisting of populated areas and forest covering the remaining 1474 km2. The Sunderban landscape is contiguous with the mangrove habitat in Bangladesh. Sunderban mangroves form part of the largest mangrove system of the Indian subcontinent with a tiger population in a distinct ecological setting. These forests have saltwater crocodiles, estuarine and marine turtles, and a number of bird species. The reserve also contains species of the fishing cat, spotted deer, rhesus monkey, and wild pig. The Sunderban is isolated with no forest connection to other tiger-occupied mainlands. Due to this, there is heavy biotic pressure for forest resources. On average, 50 metric tonnes of honey and 3 metric tonnes of wax are collected each year by locals under licence from the Indian Forest Service. The habitat is traversed by many narrow tidal channels forming small to large islands. Tigers readily cross these islands and human-tiger interactions are common. The estimation of tiger population in Sunderban, as a part of the all India tiger estimation using the refined methodology, could not be carried out owing to the unique habitat and obliteration of evidences due to high and low tides. Phase-I data collection has been completed and process is on for tiger estimation using a combination of radio telemetry and pugmark deposition rate from known tigers. =Damage from Cyclone Aila= Cyclonic Storm Aila on May 24, 2009 (image by NASA) Cyclone Aila struck Sunderban on 25 May 2009, causing damage to field camps and fringe villages bordering the reserve. Breaches in the embankments on the village side have caused large scale flooding, leaving lakhs of people marooned in the area. The field camps were under 12 to 15 feet of water for around seven hours, resulting in soil erosion and damage to staff quarters, generators and bamboo pilling. There was a report of a tiger wandering inside an abandoned cattle shed in a village, which was captured and released back in the wild. No tiger death has been reported, apart from the mortality of two spotted deer. Several NGOs have been involved in the relief operation. The Forest Department of the State has constituted a Committee and has assessed damage of almost Rs. 11150,000. Central assistance amounting to Rs. 10 million under Project Tiger has been provided to the State for restoring the damage done to infrastructure. =Challenges= The Sunderban Tiger Reserve has several challenges to its future operations. Due to wandering tigers, human- tiger conflict continues to be an issue. Sunderban tigers hunt humans, and it is estimated that over a thousand of the local people have been killed by tigers over the past four decades.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHfSTt1tcj0 An estimation of the number of tigers present in the reserve using the refined method has not yet been completed. A tiger conservation plan is awaited as are constitutions for the State level Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of the Chief Minister and the reserve-specific Tiger Conservation Foundation.  Transport  Air: Sundarban National Park is located 140 kilometres from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, which operates international flights across the world. Rail: The nearest railway station to Sundarbans National Park is Canning railway station which is located 29 km far from the Gate way of Sundarban (i.e. Godhkhali). Road: The national park can be accessed from Kolkata via West Bengal's State Highway 3. Ecosystem valuation A 2015 economic assessment study of the Sundarbans estimated that the national park provides flow benefits worth ‚Çπ12.8 billion (approximately ‚Çπ50,000 per hectare of land) annually. Important ecosystem services and their annual valuations include nursery function (‚Çπ5.17 billion), gene-pool protection (‚Çπ2.87 billion), provisioning of fish (‚Çπ1.6 billion) and waste assimilation services (‚Çπ1.5 billion). The study also mentioned services such as the generation of employment for local communities (‚Çπ36 million), moderation of cyclonic storms (‚Çπ275 million), provision of habitat and refugia for wildlife (‚Çπ360 million) and sequestration of carbon (‚Çπ462 million).

Todd was the eldest of the ten children of Walker Todd (an architect) and Christian Todd (n√©e Craik). He was educated at Dalhousie Preparatory School, Fettes College and Edinburgh College of Art. His short spell at art college convinced him that he had no creative talent as an artist and he thereafter pursued his ambition to become a poet and writer. At Fettes and art college he had proved to be a rebellious teenager and he left college prematurely to be sent by his parents to work for two years as an agricultural labourer on the Isle of Mull.David Goldie and Roderick Watson, From the Line: Scottish War Poetry 1914‚Äì1945. Glasgow; Association for Scottish Literary Studies, 2014. (p. 204) He then returned to Edinburgh to begin a career in copy-writing and journalism, while writing poetry and novels. He left Edinburgh for London in 1935. =London and Essex= He lived in a variety of types of accommodation in central London until the flat he was renting in Bloomsbury was hit by a flying bomb in 1944. He then moved to Tilty Mill House near Dunmow in Essex (later rented to poet and novelist Elizabeth Smart). During the 1930s, he became friendly with Dylan Thomas, Louis MacNeice, Geoffrey GrigsonGeoffrey Grigson, \\"Ruthven Todd\\", in Geoffrey Grigson, Recollections: Mainly of Artists and Writers.

London, Faber and Faber, 1981, pp. 181-197. , and a character based on Todd was included in Symons' first detective story, The Immaterial Murder Case. He also knew Wyndham Lewis, contributing to the Lewis issue of Julian Symons's Twentieth Century Verse. Lewis recruited Todd to keep awake the dozing Ezra Pound, whose portrait Lewis was painting. He was secretary to the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition, during which he was memorably required to rescue Salvador Dali from suffocating inside a heavy diving suit. In 1937 he worked for a period for Mass-Observation where he developed lasting friendships with Humphrey Jennings and Kathleen Raine. During this period, and throughout his life, Todd struggled to keep afloat financially and had to supplement a meagre and uncertain income from writing poetry and novels by writing reviews, tutoring and copy-writing. Todd's two allegorical novels Over the Mountain (1939) and The Lost Traveller (1943) both feature protagonists on symbolic journeys; Todd acknowledged the influence of Lewis and Rex Warner on the latter novel. Over the Mountain, a satire on fascism, has its hero travel to a dystopian nation with an oppressive government.Petra Rau, English Modernism, National Identity and the Germans: 1890 ‚Äì 1950 Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009. , (p. 150). During World War II he was a conscientious objector. Near the start of the war, he began work on an ambitious project in collaboration with the William Blake expert Sir Geoffrey Keynes to compile a catalogue raisonn√© of the artworks of William Blake. The project was to be abandoned in 1947, after Todd moved to New York, but not before a great deal had been achieved. =United States= Todd moved to the United States in 1947, where he lived for the next twelve years, becoming a US citizen in 1959. He lived initially in New York where he became friendly with the writers Alastair Reid and Howard Schoenfeld. He worked in the summer of 1947 at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 printing workshop, where he collaborated with Joan Mir√≥ and other artists in experiments relating to William Blake's printing methods. He founded and ran the Weekend Press during the early 1950s, and received friendship and some financial support from W. H. Auden. He was one of the main participants in the events surrounding Dylan Thomas's death in 1953.Peter Main, A Fervent Mind: The Life of Ruthven Todd. Stirling, Lomax Press, 2018. In 1954 he moved to live on the island of Martha's Vineyard where he began to write children's fiction, with the launch of the Space Cat series. In 1959 he was commissioned by the Trustees of the Dylan Thomas Estate to write the official biography of Thomas. However, he was forced to abandon the work three years later and the job passed to Constantine Fitzgibbon. =Mallorca= In 1960, Todd moved to Mallorca, briefly living in the village of Dei√†, where he became a friend of Robert Graves, before settling in the El Terreno district of Palma de Mallorca. He moved in 1965 to the mountain village of Galilea where he spent the remainder of his life. During the 1970s he visited America on a number of occasions to give lecture courses on Creative Writing and William Blake at the Universities of Buffalo and Maryland. He died in Galilea from emphysema in 1978. The first biography of Ruthven Todd was published in 2018. Personal Life In 1937, Todd married Cicely Crew, daughter of the geneticist Professor Francis Crew. They had one son, Christopher, born in 1939. The couple separated in 1943 and were divorced three years later. While living in New York in 1949, Todd was briefly and unsuccessfully married to Paula Norworth, before a third marriage to the artist and sculptor Joellen Hall in 1952Horrocks, Roger (2001) Len Lye: A Biography, Auckland University Press p250. They divorced in 1956. Todd had a lifelong interest in the natural world,Peter Main, \\"Ruthven Todd: Writer and Naturalist\\", in R.T. Campbell, The Death Cap.

He made some money from selling his drawings, but most were given away to friends. From his teenage years and throughout his life, Todd was a chronic alcoholic. He underwent treatment for addiction in 1965, but this was only partially successful. He was also a chain-smoker and suffered from frequent bouts of pulmonary illness.

He is one of the best and most successful ski jumper in the history of the sport. Only Finns Matti Nyk√§nen and Janne Ahonen, Poles Adam Ma≈Çysz and Kamil Stoch and Austrian Gregor Schlierenzauer have won more World Cup victories. Career Wei√üflog was born in Erlabrunn (now a part of Breitenbrunn, Saxony) in the Erzgebirge range. As a 19-year-old he won the Four Hills Tournament for East Germany in 1983/84. Wei√üflog was known as \\"Floh\\" (flea in German) due to his slight stature and his light body. That same winter he won the combined World Cup and later the normal hill event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. The following winter was dominated by Wei√üflog and the outstanding Finn Matti Nyk√§nen. The most remarkable part of his career is that he competed at the top level for twelve years. Neither the regime change from East Germany to the unified Germany in late 1990, nor the change in ski jumping techniques from the parallel technique to the V-style around 1993 stopped his success. In 1994 he won two gold medals in the individual large hill and team large hill events at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, ten years after his first Olympic victory. He finished his career in 1996 by becoming the first ski jumper to win the combined Four Hills Tournament four times. Only the Finn Janne Ahonen has surpassed that record by winning the Four Hills Tournament five times. He had also earned five-second-place finishes in the competition over the course of his career. After this achievement he retired from professional sport. At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, Wei√üflog won two golds in the individual normal hill (1985, 1989), three silvers in the individual large hill (1989) and team large hill (1984 and 1995), and four bronzes in the individual large hill (1991, 1993) and team large hill (1985 and 1991). He also won two medals at the FIS Ski Flying World Championships with a silver in 1985 and a bronze in 1990. Wei√üflog also won the ski jumping competition at the Holmenkollen ski festival twice (1989, 1990). He was awarded the Holmenkollen medal in 1991 (shared with Vegard Ulvang, Trond Einar Elden, and Ernst Vettori). Today, Jens Wei√üflog owns a hotel in his home town of Oberwiesenthal and is the main ski jump commentator for German television station ZDF.

The series of military skirmishes ended with both sides claiming victory, and the victor of the battle is still debated. On December 6 and December 7, 1846, General Stephen W. Kearny's US Army of the West, along with a small detachment of the California Battalion led by a Marine Lieutenant, engaged a small contingent of Californios and their Presidial Lancers Los Galgos (The Greyhounds), led by Major Andr√©s Pico. After U.S. reinforcements arrived, Kearny's troops were able to reach San Diego. Background Following a clash of U.S. forces with Mexican forces near the Rio Grande, Colonel Stephen Watts Kearny was promoted to a brigadier general and tasked with multiple objectives to include the seizure of New Mexico and California, establish civilian government within seized territories, disrupt trade, and to \\"act in such a manner as best to conciliate the inhabitants, and render them friendly to the United States\\". Kearny's initial force consisted of 300 regular army soldiers, 1,000 volunteers from Missouri, and the Mormon Battalion. From Fort Leavenworth, via Bent's Fort, Kearny had New Mexico capitulate without violent conflict. While in Sante Fe, Kearny established Fort Marcy, named after the Secretary of War William L. Marcy, who had ordered Kearny's force westward. En route from New Mexico, Kearny's force interacted with the Apache and Maricopa tribes, and captured a Mexican courier with news of American activities in California, with the news stating the Californios had capitulated. Forces under Commodore Sloat had taken control a significant portion of Alta California. Kearny had orders to assume command of U.S. forces in California with his, but sent back most of his force after meeting up with Kit Carson near Socorro on 6 Oct. and hearing of the seizure of California by Commodore Robert F. Stockton, Kearny keeping only Companies C & K, 1st Dragoons, about 100 men. Kearny, at that time with a force of 300 men, learning of escalating issues with the Navajo, and with the belief a smaller force could move faster, ordered 200 back to Santa Fe. Kearny's force, guided by Carson, reached Warner's Ranch in California on 2 Dec., in a greatly weakened condition.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846‚Äì1848, New York:Macmillan, They had just completed a 2,000 mile march; the longest march in U.S. Army history; the force was travel weary and mounted mules and half-broken horses which were rounded up around Warner Ranch that were owned by California Capt. Jose Maria Flores. General Kearny's Army, most originating from Fort Scott: * Captain Abraham Robinson Johnston ‚Äì regimental adjutant, Company K, 12 mounted dragoons * Captain Benjamin (Ben) Daviess Moore ‚Äì Company C, 60 dismounted dragoons, some mounted on mules * Captain Henry Smith Turner ‚Äì Kearny's Army of the West Adjutant general * Lieutenant William H.

Moor, Sergeant William Whitness, Corporal George Ramsdale, farrier David W. Johnston, Private William G. Gholston, Private William H. Fiel, Private Robert S. Gregory, Private Hugh McKaffray Both Emory and Johnston kept journals during their journey from Santa Fe. After turning back the Americans trying to recapture Los Angeles in the Battle of Dominguez Rancho, Capt. Jose Maria Flores sent about 100 men to San Luis Obispo to confront Lt. Col. John C. Fremont's 300 men moving south from Monterey, and sent another 100 men to watch Stockton's base at San Diego, but Flores kept the bulk of his men at Los Angeles. Captain Archibald Gillespie with 39 men, met Kearny on December 5 with a message from Stockton requesting Kearny confront Flores' men outside San Diego. The total American force now amounted to 179 men. USMC Acting-Captain (Lt.) Gillespie's Mounted Rifle Volunteers 'detachment' of the California Battalion: * 10 U.S. Navy sailor carbiners from 'Fleet on the Pacific Coast' F Company aboard the commanded by Acting- Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale and Passed-Midshipman James M. Duncan (later commanded ) * Sutter Fort's Russian brass 4-pounder cannon, which had been hidden after Mexican authorities tried to use the cannon against Californios at the Battle of Cahuenga Pass during the 1831 tax revolt. Charles Weber disclosed its location to Gillespie. * 26 Mounted Rifle Company, commanded by Acting-Captain (Sgt.) Samual Gibson (later commanded company B of 26th Arkansas Infantry Regiment) and longtime Kit Carson and John Fremont associate, Acting-Lieutenant Alexander Godey: including Antoine Robidoux (interpreter), Philip Crosthwaite, Beatitude Patitoux, William Henry Russell, Daniel Sexton, Franklin Sears, Thomas Burgess, Jean Nutrelle, Private Henry Booker. * Rafael Machado, Californio guide provided by San Diego Captains Leonardo Cota and Jose Alipaz took a force to San Pasqual Valley with the intention to interdict and keep in check Captain Gillespie after his departure from San Diego. Later, Major Andr√©s Pico, after a failed search for a detachment of U.S. soldiers, joined forces with the captains and took command. These Californios led a force consisting of landowners, sons of landowners, and vaqueros, many with well known and respected family names in the community: * Don Leonardo Cota: Capt. Enrique Abilia (Los Angeles), Capt. Ramon Carillo (Los Angeles), Capt. Jose Maria Cota (Los Angeles), Capt. Carlos Dominguez (Los Angeles), Capt. Nicolas Hermosillo (Los Angeles), Capt. Jose Alipaz (San Juan Capistrano), Capt. Ramon O. Suna (San Diego) * General Andres Pico: Don Leandro Osuna (San Diego), Capt. Juan Bautista Moreno, Capt. Tom√°s A. Sanchez, Capt. Pablo Vejar, Capt. Manuel Vejar On the night of December 5, a Native American informed the Californio forces of the presence of Kearny's forces. Prelude A dragoon patrol under Lieutenant Thomas C. Hammond, guided by Rafael Machado, the son of Don Jos√© Manuel Machado (grantee of Rancho El Rosario and sent by the Machado family to assist Kearny), reconnoitered Capt. Andres Pico's force along the road at San Pasqual. While Machado sneaked into the camp, Lt. Hammond became suspicious he was being set up for an ambush and rode the dragoons into the camp, where they spoke with an Indian they found sleeping in a hut. In a coincidence that has never been fully explained, a guard under the command of Machado's concu√±ado, the brother of a brother-in-law and future father-in-law, Captain Jose Alipaz, challenged the dragoons and alerted the camp to their presence. While Machado quickly ran back to Hammond's scouting party, Alipaz sounded the alarm but was dismissed by General Pico, until a U.S. Army blanket and dragoon coat were discovered on the edge of camp by Pablo V√©jar. With Capt. Alipaz, Captain Leonardo Cota and Jos√© Mar√≠a Ibarra (the Californio standing guard) chased the dragoons to the top of the next ridge with the battle cry of \\"!Viva California!\\". Pico was alerted, and the Californio camp prepared for the U.S. Army dragoons and marines to attack. Kearny had planned a surprise attack at daylight, despite the damp weather wetting down their powder and the extremely poor state of the soldiers' equipment and mounts ‚Äì mostly mules, as the horses had died on the preceding march. Battle Captain Archibald H. Gillespie of the United States Marine Corps was attacked by lancers, front and rear, at San Pascual Having lost the element of surprise, at midnight Kearny ordered an immediate advance from his camp nine miles away. It had rained that night. Men, muskets, pistols and equipment were wet and cold, but the troops, after over six months without any action, were eager to engage the Californios. Early in the morning of December 6, 1846, the column proceeded by twos across the ridge between Santa Maria (present day Ramona, California) and San Pasqual. During the descent, while it was still dark and with a low-lying fog, Kearny's force became strung out and were caught in a disadvantageous position by General Pico's swift advance. Kearny gave the plan of battle prior to proceeding down into the valley, to keep all casualties to a minimum, to encircle San Pasqual to capture fresh mounts. Captain Abraham R. Johnston's advance guard, while still three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) from Pico's forces, was ordered by Kearny to \\"Trot!\\", which Johnston misunderstood as \\"Gallop!\\". Seeing this Kearny exclaimed \\"Oh, heavens! I did not mean that!\\". Forty of the best mounted pulled far ahead of the main body of the force, in violation of the Cavalry Tactics manual of 1841, which instructed a charge to begin at just 40 paces from the enemy \\"so as to arrive in good order, and without fatiguing the horses.\\" The mules pulling the howitzers bolted, taking one of the guns with them. Pico's mounted force remained ahead of the pursuing U.S. forces. Their fresh horses and superior horsemanship allowed them to outmaneuver and lead the advance group of dragoons away from the main force. The Californios had a distinct advantage over the U.S. soldiers in their knowledge of the terrain. A second separation developed until twenty-eight dragoons, including Kearny, were separated. Damp powder reduced the effectiveness of carbines to clubs and pistols to hammers, as described by a native woman that witnessed the battle. The Californios were armed with long lances and reatas (braided rawhide lariat), which they used with great effect. As a consequence, Johnston's charge was unsupported and his dragoons were forced to withdraw. As the leading element of the U.S. force's attack drew close to a Kumeyaay village, the Californios wheeled back and fired their few firearms. At this time Captain Johnston was killed by a bullet. Pico then withdrew a half mile to higher ground. A second charge ordered by Capt. Benjamin D. Moore further separated the Americans, and the Californios met his dragoons with a counter- charge by lancers. The charge was quickly surrounded, and Capt. Moore was killed. Gillespie arrived within fifteen minutes with the artillery. Mules are reluctant to wheel, and the horse-mounted Californios outflanked the Americans and captured one of the unattended howitzers. Gillespie used a sabre to fight off a vicious personal attack made by a group of lancers in revenge for his previous actions during his occupation of Los Angeles and the broken agreement to cease hostilities. He took a lance thrust just over the heart that pierced a lung. Kearny was wounded when he was lanced, and other dragoons were worked on by teams of Californios who, with fresh mounts, would yank dragoons off their mounts, hog-tie them, and then lance them. Gillespie's men unlimbered the remaining howitzer ‚Äì John Sutter's Russian-made bronze four-pounder ‚Äì and were able to drive the Californio fighters from the field after Midshipman Duncan fired canister into them. Either this action (traditional U.S. view) or the unusual degree of bloodshed (traditional Californio view), prompted Pico to withdraw. The U.S. forces fortified a camp on a low hill north of the valley, initially placing their dead on mules that were unable to transport them before burying them outside of the camp under cover of darkness. The location of this camp is within the modern day San Diego Zoo Safari Park. Summarizing the battle, historian Owen Coy writes: Aftermath The next day, December 7, 1846, after assurances by Dr. Griffin that the worst of the injured could be moved, Captain Turner marched the column toward San Diego. Californio lancers established a blocking position near what is now known as \\"Mule Hill\\". Captain Turner ordered Lieutenant William H. Emory and a squad of dragoons to engage and drive off the menacing lancers. With dry powder in their carbines, the dragoons easily forced the lancers away, while inflicting five dead among the fleeing Californios. That evening Kearny regained his command, established a strong defensive perimeter and then sent dispatches requesting urgent reinforcements, carried to Commodore Stockton by Lieutenant Edward Beale, Kit Carson and a young Diegue√±o guide named Chemuctah. Under cover of darkness they each took different routes to the commodore's headquarters at San Diego, 28 miles (45 km) to the south-southwest. Stockton quickly dispatched a unit of over 200 sailors and marines, whose arrival caused the Californios to disperse. Kearny had already determined the night before (December 9) to continue the march the next morning. Stockton's unit then escorted Kearny's battered troops to San Diego, where they arrived December 12. Dr. John S. Griffin, Kearny's surgeon, reported that the Americans had lost 17 killed and 18 wounded out of the 50 officers and men who engaged Pico's lancers. When they arrived in San Diego, the wounded survivors were treated by their Californio guide's sister, Nurse Juanita Machado Alipas de Wrightington, known as the Florence Nightingale of San Diego for her charity work for the oppressed native peoples camped outside San Diego. Collection at Bancroft Library (C-D 119), Berkeley, California General Kearny's official report states: \\"On the morning of the 7th, having made ambulances for our wounded . . . we proceeded on our march, when the enemy showed himself, occupying the hills in our front, which they left as we approached, till reaching San Bernardo a party of them took possession of a hill near to it and maintained their position until attacked by our advance, who quickly drove them from it, killing and wounding five of their number with no loss on our part.\\" Some time after the battle, General Kearny wrote that the U.S. had achieved victory since the Californios had \\"fled the field,\\" but the Californios saw the engagement as their victory. The battle is unique, as it was one of the few military battles in the United States that involved elements of the Army, Navy, Marines, and civilian volunteers, all in the same skirmish. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, historians debated which force won or lost the battle. Clearly, Kearny retained the battle area, the ability to operate and maneuver, and also the initiative, though his losses were significantly higher; however, he did not implement his battle plan, his ammunition was compromised, and he outran his artillery and supply line. According to Geoffrey Regan: Historian Lt. Colonel Cory Hollon cited Kearny's misjudgments: the battle was arguably unnecessary; the operating environment disadvantaged Kearny; he was unaware, or possibly misinformed, about the character of the threat; Kearny overestimated or misused his friendly forces; and Kearny culminated at San Pasqual because he had overextended his supply chain, resulting in a poorly prepared force facing an underestimated enemy. Hollon states that Kearny's misjudgments resulted in nearly disastrous consequences for the Army of the West and put the United States‚Äô plans for conquest and empire in peril. In late December 1846, Kearny's force began its march to Los Angeles. It consisted of a mixed force of Army dragoons, Navy sailors, Marines, volunteers and artillery. Although there was contention on leadership of U.S. forces in California, this and Stockton's combined forces went on to engage the Californios at the Battle of Rio San Gabriel, resulting in a Californio retreat. The following day the Battle of La Mesa resulted in another Californio defeat, leading to the surrender of the Pueblo de Los √Ångeles and later the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga. Historian Hollon wrote: Legacy Marker of reburied service members who died during the Battle of San Pasqual * Fort Moore was constructed on North Hill Street in downtown Los Angeles, California, originally as an improvised defensive position used by Lt.

Early life and education Ward was born in Salem, Massachusetts on November 29, 1831. Ward was rebellious in his youth, so his father removed Ward from school in 1847 and found him a position as second mate on the Hamilton, a clipper ship commanded by a family friend.Carr, 40 & Smith, 25 Another version is that Ward demanded to leave school. Life at sea proved difficult. Ward was given authority over many ‚Äúold salts‚Äù. He was thrown overboard after complaints that he gave too many orders for a youth.Carr, 40 Captain William Allen recalled that Ward possessed traits of ‚Äúreckless daring‚Äù, but was on the whole a valuable officer.Smith, 26 On the Hamilton, Ward sailed from New York to Hong Kong in 1847, but probably saw little beyond the port city because the Qing Dynasty forbade foreigners from venturing inland (Hong Kong Island had become a British Crown Colony in 1842, at the end of the First Opium War). In 1849 Ward enrolled at the ‚ÄúAmerican Literary, Scientific and Military Academy‚Äù, now Norwich University, in Vermont, where the curriculum included military tactics, strategy, drill, and ceremonies. He attended for only a few months, before he left school and never returned. In 1850 he shipped out as first mate of the clipper ship Russell Clover. His father was the captain.

XO on the Confucius, armed pirate suppression river steamer. Commander, Foreign Army Corps. Luong, David Filibustering Aside from working as a sailor during the 1850s, Ward found employment, as a \\"filibuster\\". \\"Filibustering\\" is \\"raising private mercenary armies and leading them into other countries to advance either [one's own] schemes or those of wealthy sponsors\\".Carr, 58 Ward worked for the infamous ‚ÄúKing of the Filibusters‚Äù, William Walker, in Mexico, where he learned how to recruit, train, and command mercenary troops. William Walker Ward also learned to avoid some of Walker's practices and behaviors. Walker has a reputation for being \\"excessively vain, weak minded and ambitious‚Ä¶ his weakness renders him cruel‚Ä¶\\"Carr 59 During Ward's later time in China, he displayed respect and concern for the Western and Chinese troops under his command, whom he referred to as \\"my people\\". Ward learned about practical warfare during his \\"filibusteresque\\" experience in 1854 and when he served as a lieutenant with the French Army in the Crimean War. He learned about weapons, tactics, using riflemen in mobile platoons rather than in fixed firing lines and siege techniques.Carr 65, Smith 28 Ward also learned that the frontal assault was of limited value against disciplined long-range firepower, and he gained experience under fire. He did not serve throughout the entire war, because he was 'allowed' to resign after being insubordinate to a superior officer. In 1857, Ward sought work as a mercenary, but when he did not secure such work, he served as the first mate on a coastal steamship in dangerous waters. He worked as a shipping agent in his father's New York City office alongside his brother in 1859. Shanghai newcomer According to a contemporary account written in early 1862, Ward and his brother arrived in Shanghai, China in 1860 for the purpose of trading, perhaps as an extension of their father's New York office. This may be true, but given Ward's activities in the 1850s it is almost certain that Ward had ulterior motives for his return. We can be sure he had little respect for the Shanghai business practices, which he dismissed as ‚Äúlying, swindling and smuggling‚Äù.Carr, 97 Their arrival coincided with a buildup of Taiping forces in the area. While Ward's brother set up a trading business in Shanghai, Ward himself took up customary employment as the executive officer on the Confucius, an armed riverboat commanded by an American, employed by the ‚ÄúShanghai Pirate Suppression Bureau‚Äù. The Bureau was organized by Xue Huan and Wu Xu, Shanghai governmental officials who took pains to shield explicit imperial association with Western mercenaries and military, and primarily funded by Yang Fang, a prominent Ningbo banker and mercantilist. Ward's show of bravery and initiative on board the Confucius reflected great credit upon him, and the prominent men of Shanghai took notice. His exploits, previous military experience, ability to empathise with local populations and motivate Chinese soldiers, and his stated mercenary intentions, made him an attractive candidate to lead a force of foreign nationals in defense of Shanghai against encroaching Taiping forces. Wu Xu and Yang Fang both increasingly recognized that such a force was necessary, as Imperial forces, frequently staffed by Confucian scholars and conscripts, rather than experienced commanders and soldiers, had all too often proven unequal to the task of defeating Taiping forces. Through their contacts with the Western business community, and Ward's own relentless self-promotion, in the spring of 1860 Wu and Fang reached out to Ward and became his employers. Ward then began scouring the wharves of Shanghai for every Westerner, sober or otherwise, capable of firing a weapon. With this, the ‚ÄúShanghai Foreign Arms Corps‚Äù was born, which in defeat, would form the nucleus for the ‚ÄúEver Victorious Army‚Äù. Shanghai Foreign Arms Corps In 1860, both Chinese and Westerners would place more faith in a small, motley group of mercenaries than readily available local citizenry, because the average Chinese of the time had little understanding of marksmanship, nor much impetus to defend the Manchu throne. Further, with Taiping armies edging closer to Shanghai, there was no time to train native peasants in either conventional Chinese or Western warfare. On the Shanghai docks, however, Westerners with diverse military experience existed as ‚Äúdischarged seamen, deserters, and other drifters who made Shanghai their temporary home, and even the gainfully employed could be tempted by the prospect of adventure, high pay, and loot.‚ÄùMacGowan, 103 This weapon, already forged, was used by Ward against the Taipings, with the backing of local Shanghai ministers and merchants, in a highly charged political atmosphere in which the Manchu Imperial forces had no desire to show their reliance upon Western powers. By the same token, the diplomats and military men of the Western powers discouraged foreign involvement in domestic Chinese matters, even by Westerners in Chinese employ. The Western powers' concerns did not relate to principle ‚Äì they were most concerned about the power of the Taipings to block trade downriver from the interior to Shanghai if neutrality were violated. By June 1860, Ward had a polyglot force of 100 Westerners, trained in the best small arms (including Colt revolvers) and rifles available for purchase in Shanghai. Protesting that his forces were not fully trained, Ward was forced by his Shanghai backers to take his men into action alongside Imperial forces probing Taiping advances, retaking two captured towns. They were then forced by circumstances (and the urging of their Shanghai backers) to assault the Taiping occupied and fortified city of Songjiang, without artillery ‚Äì a near-impossible task. The attack failed, sending the thoroughly defeated force back to Shanghai. However, by mid-July, Ward had recruited additional Westerners and over 80 Filipino \\"Manilamen\\", and purchased several artillery pieces, and once again, his forces assaulted Sung- Chiang (ÊùæÊ±ü). They were successful, but at enormous cost. Out of a force of roughly 250 men, 62 were killed, and 100 were wounded, including Ward himself. Ward and his forces now gained a notoriety that attracted new recruits (for the pay was attractive, even if looting was discouraged by Ward), and enraged local Westerners who saw Ward as an inflammatory, filibustering element sure to force the Taipings to stop the flow of trade. More disconcertingly, the Taipings themselves were now aware of a new and potent force against them. On August 2, 1860, Ward led the Foreign Arms Corps against Chingpu (‰∏äÊµ∑ÈùíÊµ¶), the next town from Sung-chiang on the approaches to Shanghai, and this time the Taiping were prepared. As the Corps stormed a garrison wall, Taiping forces lying in ambush waited for the optimum moment and then delivered a withering barrage of close-range musket fire. Within 10 minutes, the Foreign Arms Corps had suffered 50% casualties, and Ward himself was shot in the left jaw, with an exit wound in the right cheek, scarring him for life and leaving him with a speech impediment. The force retreated and Ward returned to Shanghai for medical treatment and to attempt to recruit more forces and buy additional artillery. Within several days he and the remnants of the Foreign Arms Corps laid siege to Chingpu and bombarded it with artillery. By this time, the Taiping's best military leader Li Xiucheng (ÊùéÁßÄÊàê), called Zhong Wang (Âø†Áéã) or ‚ÄúThe Faithful King‚Äù, dispatched 20,000 troops downriver to break the siege, sending the Foreign Arms Corps fleeing back to the Songjiang area, where Ward's second-in-command, Henry Andres Burgevine (another American fortune seeker), held the Corps briefly together, but it soon \\"ceased to function as an organized entity\\" Smith, 34 Ward returned to Shanghai for further treatment of his injury, and was there while the Zhong Wang's forces laid siege, and were beaten back by Western and Imperial forces within the City. Ward left Shanghai (apparently secretly) in late 1860 for further treatment of his facial wound, while the remnants of the Corps remained more or less under the command of Burgevine. After Ward's death, Burgevine briefly took command of the force, but could not get along with his Imperial Chinese superiors and struck Yang Fang, whereupon Burgevine was relieved of command; he later went over to the Taiping rebels. In 1865, Burgevine was arrested by Imperial officers and died in a drowning accident.Smith, 113 It is unclear as to whether Yang was still funding the Corps in the late fall of 1860, but upon Ward's return in the spring of 1861, Ward was able to attract desired elements of the Corps back to his employ. After his return, Ward tenaciously began to recruit and train replacements for the Foreign Arms Corps, offering terms attractive enough to cause desertion among the many British warships in port. Ward, facing arrest and numerous political difficulties arising from the Western governments' desire to remain neutral, opted to become a Chinese subject, stymieing efforts by the British navy and other Western forces to stop him. In May 1861, Ward once again led the Foreign Arms Corps into battle at Chingpu, and once again, the assault failed, with heavy casualties. This was the last major engagement of the Foreign Arms Corps in its ‚Äúprimarily Western‚Äù configuration. Judgments as to the effectiveness of the Foreign Army Corps vary depending upon the sympathies of the author. The most recent Ward biographer, Caleb Carr, seems fairly generous in his estimation of Ward's accomplishments in his 1992 work. However, perhaps the most authoritative judgment was rendered by Richard J. Smith, who stated: ‚ÄúRepeatedly sent into the field without adequate preparation by Ward's frantic sponsors, the poorly trained and ill-disciplined contingent stood virtually no chance of success against Li Xiucheng's seasoned troops. Sometimes drunk and always disorderly, the Foreign-Arms Corps depended primarily on the element of surprise and the superiority of Western weapons to obtain victory.‚ÄùSmith 33 Ward clearly recognized the harsh truth of this statement. He soon embarked upon a new scheme, in which he would reform the more reliable elements of the Corps into the nucleus of an effective fighting force, composed primarily of local Chinese. Commander of the Ever Victorious Army Credit for the concept of training Chinese in Western military tactics and arming them with the best available weaponry is sometimes given to Ward, other times to Li Hongzhang, a local Imperial commander ‚Äúordered to cooperate with ‚Äî and keep an eye on ‚Äî Ward's unruly contingent‚Äù and other times to Burgevine, who according to some began the training while Ward was recuperating, having been inspired by the sight of a Chinese gun crew acting under French direction.Smith, 37 Perhaps another factor in the reconsideration of local Chinese troops was the changing mood of the local peasantry. Where before they had been unwilling to fight for Manchu primacy, they were now constantly threatened and in some cases occupied by Taiping forces that were, despite their ‚Äúheavenly‚Äù origin, ruthless in their treatment of local populations. Indeed, in many cases informal militias were formed to drive Taiping forces out, and conduct guerilla operations.Spence, 307 Regardless of the concept's true origin, Ward became its champion and after his untimely death, no other commander could quite repeat his success. Ward's decision to turn to local Chinese forces would ensure his place in history, and help to end the Taiping Rebellion. By the summer of 1861, a training camp was established by Xue Huan's ‚Äúright hand man‚Äù Wu Xu (Âê≥ÁÖ¶) at Song Chiang (ÊùæÊ±ü), where Ward set up operations. Working with the best of the survivors of the Foreign Arms Corp, and supported by a strong Headquarters staff, Ward trained an increasing number (see below) of Chinese in western small arms, gunnery, tactics, customs and drill and ceremonies. Particular care was taken to train the Chinese to hold their fire until their targets were within effective range. Chinese troops, both Taiping and Imperial, ‚Äúhad a lingering faith‚Ä¶ in the intimidating power of noise‚Äù.Carr, 165 He even trained them to respond to western bugle calls and verbal commands, and most strikingly, outfitted them in Western-style utility uniforms, color-coded for branch of arms (Infantry or Artillery), with Indian ‚ÄúSepoy‚Äù style turbans. This garb, at first distressing to the Chinese troops, earned them the nickname ‚ÄúImitation Foreign Devils‚Äù among the local populace, as well as a fair share of mockery. In time, as the troops proved themselves the equal of their European counterparts, both on the parade ground and the battlefield, their distinct uniforms would become a point of pride. Another point of pride was their pay, which was both high and consistent by Chinese standards ‚Äì a strong recruiting drive that triumphed over most discomfort with unfamiliar uniforms. The pay was high in part to attract new recruits to dangerous work, but also to compensate for the lack of ‚Äúlooting‚Äù opportunity. Ward strongly discouraged looting, as he knew the practice turned local populaces against their ‚Äúliberators‚Äù. Other benefits offered to Ward's men included better rations, billets, and of course, better chance of survival in combat. By January 1862, with about one thousand Chinese soldiers trained and ready, Ward stated that his unit was ready for the field ‚Äì much to the relief of his Shanghai backers, particularly Yang Fang, who had significantly invested both government and private funds into the force's recruitment, arms and supplies. This was timely, as within the same month, the Chung Wang's forces reentered that region with over 120,000 troops, in an attempt to first cut off, and then enter and occupy Shanghai. Ward, ever hungry for glory and no doubt seeking redress for his facial injury, welcomed the conflict, and was absolutely confident in his troops' ability to defend his Songjiang headquarters, while simultaneously operating as ‚Äúflying columns‚Äù to be directed to strategic areas and Taiping vulnerabilities. He soon had several opportunities to test this confidence. In the middle of January, about 10 miles north of Shanghai in Wu-Sung, and over 25 snow-covered miles from their own headquarters, Ward lead his new army into action, under a banner carrying a Chinese rendering of his own name reading ‚ÄúHUA‚Äù (ËèØ, Âçé). His forces drove the Taipings from their entrenched positions, despite greater rebel numbers. A week later, after a return march, Ward's forces struck at the city of Guangfulin, occupied by over 20,000 Taiping troops, just five miles from Ward's own headquarters. Ward, at the head of five hundred men, attacked the city without artillery support. The defenders, seeing the strange attire, military skill and foreign leadership of their own countrymen, wavered and ‚Äúwere filled with dismay and fled precipitately‚Äù Carr, 181 In February, again facing Taiping forces moving near his training area, Ward took five hundred troops and in joint operations with local Imperial commanders, drove the rebels from Yinchipeng, Chenshan, Tianmashan, and other areas around Songjiang.Smith, 40 In the course of these actions against superior numbers, thousands of Taiping were killed or wounded, while Ward himself suffered five wounds, including the loss of a finger to a musket ball.Carr, 181 Li Xiucheng, enraged at this foreign irritant, had a force of 20,000 attack Songjiang, defended only by Ward's force of about 1,500 men. Upon approach, rebel forces came under the fire of camouflaged artillery and lost over 2,000 men. Immediately thereafter infantry struck out of the city at the rebels, and cut off and captured another 800, while capturing a large number of boats bearing Taiping supplies and arms. The Taipings beat a hasty retreat, rather than lay siege to such a hornet's nest. It was this moment, perhaps, that secured Ward's reputation among all the people of the Shanghai area; Chinese, Western and Taiping alike. From this moment on, the key Western commanders and politicians would support him, funds for troops would flow relatively freely from Imperial coffers, and his decisions would no longer be second-guessed by his backers in Shanghai. By March 1862, Ward's force would be officially named by the Qing government, and to history, as ‚ÄúThe Ever Victorious Army‚Äù, and Ward himself would be made first a 4th-rank, and then a 3rd-rank mandarin, high honors from the Manchu court for a \\"barbarian\\".Smith, 51-54 Through the course of 1862, ‚ÄúThe Ever Victorious Army‚Äù (Â∏∏ÂãùËªç); would essentially live up to its name, again and again defeating numerically superior opponents, often in entrenched positions. Further, its presence on the battlefield and example of effective Chinese soldiering served as a ‚Äúforce multiplier‚Äù for Imperial Anhui units commanded by Li Hongzhang, between whom and Ward mutual respect grew during joint operations. During the summer, Ward's ‚Äúduckfoot‚Äù background found immediate application to the problems of land warfare. The Chung Wang's growing Taiping forces in the area led to multiple threats at multiple points across the region. Clearly, mobility was needed for Ward's limited forces, but the road system was inadequate. While another commander might have tried to solve the problem through additional wagons and horses, Ward saw the rivers and canals criss-crossing the region not as obstacles, but as passageways. He quickly secured the use of several river steamers, fitted them out as mobile artillery and troop transports, and increased his army's effectiveness several times over. Li Xiucheng himself later ‚Äúattributed his defeats in the Suzhou area to Western steamers. Taiping land forces could contend with \\"foreign devils\\", he believed, but rebel water forces could not.\\"Smith, 95 Throughout this time, Ward's reputation continued to grow. Ward himself, outwardly caring little for public adulation, still sought to quench some inner need for further glory, and hoped to participate in an eventual strike against Nanjing, the Taiping capital, but this was not to be. The Manchu court, suspicious of Ward from the beginning, grew even more concerned that as time passed, he refused to shave his forehead, wear a queue or even appear in his fine Mandarin robes. These and other comments regarding his ambitions led the court to limit the size of his unit far beneath his potential to recruit for it, and to give Ward far less rein than they would have to a commander with more Confucian leanings. By September, the Ever Victorious Army would number over 5,000 men, organized in four battalions as well as an artillery corps, with several riverboats used for transport and mobile artillery.

Ward had survived 14 previous battlefield injuries. Ward lingered for a day. During that time he dictated a will ensuring his brother, sister and Chinese wife, Chang Meihua, would be cared for; he died on the morning of September 22, 1862. Ward died at the height of his fame, leaving an unusual, original army forged by an even more unusual commander. Legacy Just as the events of the American Civil War overshadowed Ward's accomplishments in China during his life, his reputation after his death was overshadowed by Charles George Gordon, aka \\"Chinese Gordon\\", a British Army officer. After Ward's death, the command of the Ever- Victorious Army passed to his second in command, E. Forrester, Henry Andres Burgevine and later to Gordon. Gordon biographers diminish or disregard that Ward creation, the Ever Victorious Army, an original and unique military development which made Gordon's famed success in China possible. Today, Chinese Gordon is remembered, while Ward is largely forgotten. Some of Gordon's fame is due to his dramatic death in Khartoum years after the Taiping Rebellion. There have been several books on Ward and the Ever Victorious Army by Ward's contemporaries and biographers published in the century since his death that seek to acknowledge Ward's contributions. The bestseller, The Devil Soldier (1992), by renowned historian and novelist Caleb Carr, was optioned for a motion picture soon after publication. Actor Tom Cruise and director John Woo were developing a movie scripted by Carr, but the project was never completed. The plot of the film The Last Samurai, produced in 2003, was inspired by the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion led by Saig≈ç Takamori, and to a lesser extent, by the stories of Jules Brunet, a French army captain who fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the earlier Boshin War, and of Frederick Townsend Ward. =Physical remains and monuments= There are just two U.S. memorials to Ward, both in Salem, MA: a headstone at an unfilled grave, and a collection of materials detailing his life and times by the Essex Institute. Caleb Carr explains that ‚ÄúWard's remains were dug up, and his grave site and shrine were destroyed and paved over. The whereabouts of Ward's bones today are unknown. They have almost certainly been destroyed. A plain headstone over a cenotaph in Salem is the only memorial to this most noteworthy of nineteenth-century American adventurers.‚ÄùCarr, 5 Ward is also remembered in a Songjiang Roman Catholic Church, and in a Nanjing museum. One visitor wrote ‚ÄúThe grave of Ward, a Protestant, revered as a Chinese Confucian hero, with a temple in his honour, now lies under the altar of a Roman Catholic church [built in 1982], whilst the land itself is the property of the local Buddhist monastery in a Communist state... Ward has not been forgotten in Songjiang and local memory still has Ward's bones under the high altar of the Catholic church‚Äù.Stevens Ward's accomplishments are documented in the Taiping Rebellion Museum in Nanjing. One visitor remarked ‚ÄúTo my surprise I saw, in a museum in Nanjing, a tribute to Ward ‚Äî a large headstone bearing Ward's name, put in place by the American Legion on May 29, 1923.‚ÄúMaher =American Legion China Post 1(r)= American Legion China Post 1, formed in 1919 one year after the \\"great war\\" and chartered by the American Legion on 20 April 1920, was originally named the General Frederick Townsend Ward Post No. 1, China.

Ward appears as Fletcher Thorson Wood in the novel Yang Shen by James Lande, which relates the tale of the first three years of the Ever Victorious Army, from its beginning as the Foreign Rifles in 1860 through September 1862.

Gallus is generally regarded as the first historian to have described Polish history. His Chronicles are an obligatory text for university courses in Poland's history. Very little is known of the author himself. Kromer Monument to Gall Anonim, Wroc≈Çaw, Poland The only source for Gallus' real name is a note made by Prince-Bishop of Warmia Marcin Kromer (1512‚Äì89) in the margin of folio 119 of the \\"Heilsberg manuscript.\\"Paul W. Knoll and Frank Schaer, eds., Gesta Principum Polonorum: The Deeds of the Princes of the Poles, Budapest, 2003, pp. xxiv‚Äîv. It reads: Gallus hanc historiam scripsit, monachus, opinor, aliquis, ut ex proemiis coniicere licet qui Boleslai tertii tempore vixit (Gallus wrote this history, some monk, in my opinion, who lived in the time of Boles≈Çaw III, as can be conjectured from the preface.') It is not known whether Kromer intended the word \\"Gallus\\" as a proper name or as a reference to the author's nationality (Gallus in this period normally means \\"a Frenchman\\"), nor what he based his identification on. The Heilsberg manuscript, one of three extant witnesses of the Gesta, was written between 1469 and 1471. From the mid-16th to 18th centuries, it was kept in the town of Heilsberg (today Lidzbark Warmi≈Ñski, Poland). It was later published at the behest of Prince-Bishop of Warmia Adam Stanis≈Çaw Grabowski (1698‚Äì1766). Origin The author of the Gesta wrote little about himself and was not written about in contemporary sources. What Gallus did write about himself may be summed up as follows: Before going to Poland, he likely spent some time in Hungary, where he met Polish duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth; he was a pilgrim; he revered Saint Giles; and he knew little about Scandinavia. Historians agree that Gallus' writing style indicates a substantial education, available only to nobles and monks; and that he was an experienced writer, thus likely also to have authored earlier works. The clericus de penna vivens (\\"cleric living by his pen\\") is suspected by Danuta BorawskaDanuta Borawska, \\"Gallus Anonim czy Italus Anonim?\\" (\\"Gallus Anonimus or Italus Anonimus?\\"), PrzeglƒÖd Historyczny (Historical Review), 1965. and Marian Plezia to have earlier penned the Gesta Hungarorum (Deeds of the Hungarians) and the Translatio Sancti Nicolai (The Transfer of St. Nicholas); and his writing style is thought to have been influenced by recent literary developments that were then common only in northern France and the Netherlands. Statue, in Budapest's Vajdahunyad Castle, of Anonymus, author of The Deeds of the Hungarians and possibly of Gesta principum Polonorum. Sculptor: Mikl√≥s Ligeti Budapest's Vajdahunyad Castle features an evocative bronze statue of a seated Anonymus in monk's habit, the cowl obscuring his face. Gallus' place of origin is unknown. Several theories have been advanced. Traditional scholarship has assumed that he was French (hence Gallus), perhaps from France or Flanders.Paul W. Knoll and Frank Schaer, eds., Gesta Principum Polonorum..., pp. xxvii‚Äîix. Plezia has suggested that he was a monk from Saint Giles' Monastery in Provence, France.Marian Plezia, ed., Anonim tzw. Gall, translated [from the Latin into Polish] by Roman Grodecki, Ossolineum, 2003, . Some scholars have pointed out that Gallus' writing style resembles that of Hildebert of Lavardin (aka Hildebert of Tours) and have thought that Gallus had been educated at Le Mans or, according to Zathey,J. Zathey, \\"W jakich szko≈Çach uczy≈Ç siƒô Gall Anonim?\\" (\\"What Schools Did Gallus Anonimus Attend?\\"), Sprawozdania Polskiej Akademii Umiejƒôtno≈õci (Proceedings of the Polish Academy of Learning), 1952, z. 7-10, p. 555. at Chartres or Bec in Normandy. Before World War II, French historian Pierre David advanced a theory that Gallus might have been a Hungarian monk from Saint Giles' Monastery in Somogyv√°r who accompanied Prince Boles≈Çaw III in his return from Hungary to Poland. This theory enjoys little support.Pierre David, \\"La Pologne dans l‚Äôobituaire de Saint-Gilles en Languedoc au XII e siƒçcle,\\" Revue des √âtudes Slaves, 19 (1939). Another theory has been gaining ground in Poland. Professors Danuta Borawska and Tomasz Jasi≈Ñski of Pozna≈Ñ University have presented a case for a Venetian origin.Danuta Borawska, Ma≈Ça Historia Literatury Polskiej (A Brief History of Polish Literature), Warsaw, PWN, 2005, pp. 52-53. Roman Sidorski, Interview with Professor Tadeusz Jasi≈Ñski: Kierunek - Wenecja!, Histmag, 2006-04-10. It has been argued that Gallus may have been a monk from St. Giles' Monastery at the Lido, Venice, Italy, and Professor Plezia has subsequently concurred.\\"Nowe studia nad Gallem-Anonimem\\" (\\"New Studies about Gallus Anonymus\\"), in Mente et litteris. O kulturze i spo≈Çecze≈Ñstwie wiek√≥w ≈õrednich (Mente et litteris: On Culture and Society in the Middle Ages), Pozna≈Ñ, 1984, pp. 111-20; Anonim tzw. Gall, Kronika polska (The Anonymous \\"Gaul,\\" The Polish Chronicle), edited by Marian Plezia, translated [from the Latin into Polish] by Roman Grodecki, Wroc≈Çaw, 1996. The Venetian theory was first broached in 1904 by Polish historian Tadeusz Wojciechowski. In 1965 it was proposed again by Borawska but did not win acceptance. In recent years, however, it has been revisited and has now gained positive reviews from several Polish medievalists. It has been supported by Professors Janusz Bieniak, Roman Micha≈Çowski and Wojciech Fa≈Çkowski.Na tropie tajemnicy Galla Anonima, Polish Press Agency, 2006-02-15. Fa≈Çkowski has noted that the two theories‚ÄîFrench and Italian‚Äîmay be less mutually exclusive than some think, as Gallus might have been born in Italy, been a monk at the Lido, and have later traveled to France and Hungary. According to Tomasz Jasi≈Ñski, who in 2008 published a book on Gallus,Tomasz Jasi≈Ñski, O pochodzeniu Galla Anonima (On the Origins of Gallus Anonymus), Avalon, 2008, . the chronicler came to Poland over the Via Egnatia across the Slavic-speaking countries of \\"Epirus, Thrace, Dalmatia, Croatia, Istria.\\" When Jasi≈Ñski compared the Chronicle with the Transfer of St. Nicholas, he found over 100 similarities. Jasi≈Ñski has concluded that Gallus, like many Venetian clergymen of the time, had a native knowledge of both Italian and Slavic languages.Gallus Anonymus' cursus velox is also in accord with a Venetian origin. Feliks Pohorecki in 1930 formulated a hypothesis that if one found an author using cursus spondiacus (spondee?) simultaneously with cursus velox, that fact might identify Anonymus. The Swedish Latinist Tore Janson found cursus spondiacus in the school of Hildebert of Tours, and the anonymous author wrote in the Transfer of St. Nicholas about a stay at Tours and the celebration of a mass at the Lido. Jasi≈Ñski concludes, \\"There is no reason, therefore, to doubt that Gallus Anonymous [the Anonymous Gaul] was Monachus Littorensis [the Littoral Monk].\\" See Tomasz Jasi≈Ñski, \\"Was Gallus Anonymus, Monachus Littorensis?\\" Summaries, Kwartalnik Historyczny (Historical Quarterly), CXII, 2005, 3. (abstract 1 , abstract 2 ) However, Paul W. Knoll and Frank Schaer regard the Venetian suggestion as \\"too weak to be considered seriously.\\"Paul W. Knoll and Frank Schaer, eds., Gesta Principum Polonorum..., p. xxix. In Poland, medievalist Professor Jacek Banaszkiewicz supports a French over an Italian origin for Gallus Anonymus. Influence The anonymous author of the Gesta influenced the subsequent course of Poland's history, in that his version of early Polish history held the ruler's authority to be inferior to that of God, as expressed by the voice of the people (as in the Latin proverb, \\"Vox populi, vox Dei\\"). This concept reinforced Poles' electoral traditions and their tendency to disobey and question authority. Via the Chronicles of Wincenty Kad≈Çubek and the Sermons of Stanis≈Çaw of Skarbimierz, it contributed to the development of the unique \\"Golden Liberty\\" that would characterize the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, whose kings were elected and were obliged to obey the Sejm (parliament).

His parents moved to the Sydney suburb of Liverpool where he attended Austral Public School and Hurlstone Agricultural High School. He later became a farm worker. Second World War On 20 May 1940 Edmondson enlisted in the 2/17th Battalion after serving with the 4th Militia Battalion since March 1939. He was promoted to corporal. After training at Ingleburn and Bathurst, his battalion embarked for the Middle East on 19 October 1940 as reinforcements for the 9th Division. After desert training, his division relieved the 6th Australian Division at Marsa Brega in Cyrenaica on 9 March 1941. On 31 March, the German forces under the command of General Erwin Rommel mounted an attack on the Australian and British positions, forcing them to retreat. The 9th Division took up new positions outside the port of Tobruk and on 11 April, the now famous siege began. =Victoria Cross citation= The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the London Gazette on 1 July 1941, reading: An hour later, 200 German infantrymen attacked the post, forcing the Australians to withdraw, and established a bridgehead in the outer defensive line. However, the fierceness of the platoon's defence pressured Rommel into diverting troops from his main attack. The attack failed, with the German tanks being mauled and forced to retreat with heavy casualties. Corporal John Edmondson died of his wounds and is buried in the Tobruk war cemetery. He was the first Australian to receive the Victoria Cross in the war. Edmondson's VC was presented to his mother by the Governor-General on 27 September 1941.

A section of drover's road at Cotkerse near Blairlogie, Scotland A drovers' road, drove [road] or droveway is a route for droving livestock on foot from one place to another, such as to market or between summer and winter pasture (see transhumance).K.J. Bonser, \\"The Drovers\\", London, 1970 Many drovers' roads were ancient routes of unknown age; others are known to date back to medieval or more recent times.See http://www.heritagepaths.co.uk/ Description Drovers' roads are often wider than other roads, able to accommodate large herds or flocks. Packhorse ways were quite narrow as the horses moved in single file, whereas drove roads were at least and up to wide.Addison (1980), Pp. 70-78. In the United Kingdom, where many original drovers' roads have been converted into single carriageway metalled roads, unusually wide verges often give an indication of the road's origin. In Wales, the start of many droveways, drovers' roads are often recognisable by being deeply set into the countryside, with high earth walls or hedges. The most characteristic feature of these roads is the occasional dog-leg turn in the road, which provided cover for animals and men in severe rain or snow. Some drovers' roads crossed mountains. It is likely that the so-called Roman Steps in the Rhinogydd in Wales is an example of a drove road.  Drovers  Drovers (those droving or driving livestock) accompanied their livestock either on foot or on horseback, travelling substantial distances. Rural England, Wales and Scotland are crossed by numerous drove roads that were used for this trade, many of which are now no more than tracks, and some lost altogether. The word \\"drover\\" is used for those engaged in long distance trade - distances which could cover much of the length of Britain or other world regions where droving was used - while \\"driver\\" was used for those taking cattle to local markets. Drovers used dogs to help control the stock, and these would sometimes be sent home alone after a drove, retracing their outward route and being fed at inns or farms the drove had 'stanced' at; the drover would pay for their food on his next journey. A newspaper reported that the dogs mostly used in London for droving to the outlying butcheries and depots were principally collies, but in this show were a few of the old English bob-tailed animals seldom seen in London except on show, and not so often seen in the country as was the case thirty or forty years ago. Controlling herds of three or four hundred animals on narrow roads, keeping them healthy, and feeding them en route over several weeks or months required expertise and authority. There was licensing under the legislation, introduced in 1563, intended to control '\\"badgers\\" of grain and drovers of cattle, although it seems to have been less rigorously applied to drovers. Drovers' dogs were also licenced. They were also exempted from the Disarming Acts of 1716 and 1748, which were passed after Jacobite risings. They were not necessarily literate but were respected as experts in their trade.  Early history  Some form of drovers' roads existed in Romano- British times and certainly throughout the Early Middle Ages. For example, the old east-west drovers' road connecting the Dorset/Exeter region with London and thence Suffolk is along a similar alignment to the Roman road of the same route. Many lengths of the Welsh Road through the English Midlands coincide with manorial or parish boundaries, suggesting that it predates them and probably had pre-Roman origins as an ancient trackway. Medieval drovers' roads In Great Britain, Drove as a placename can be traced to the early 13th century, and there are records of cattle driven from Wales to London and sheep from Lincolnshire to York in the early 14th century. Drovers from Scotland were licensed in 1359 to drive stock through England.Official Publication (1825). Rymer, Foedera, III, Record Comm.Edn., 1825, III, part 1, 415. Quoted in Haldane (1997), P 11. These may be simply the earliest records of a more ancient trade. There is increasing evidence for large-scale cattle-rearing in Bronze Age and Iron Age Britain. Cattle and sheep were part of the Romano- British economy. By the Anglo-Saxon period there was long distance movement of cattle, including stolen stock. What is certain is that during the medieval period there was a substantial trade in cattle out of Wales into England, to which cattle from Ireland were added. These were driven across Somerset, WiltshireK.G. Watts, Droving in Wiltshire, Trowbridge Publishing (1990) and Berkshire to feed the growing population of London. The drovers made use of ancient ridgeways, including the Ridgeway over the Berkshire Downs and ridgeways still known as the Old Shaftesbury Drove and the Ox Drove leading from Shaftesbury and Blandford to Salisbury. Medieval drovers' roads were wide by medieval standards, 20 metres across, with wide grazing verges on either side, the \\"long acre\\".M.L. Ryder, \\"Late medieval transhumance in Western Europe\\" in Angus MacKay, David Ditchburn, Atlas of Medieval Europe, 1997:219ff. Ca√±ada Real Leonesa Occidental in Province of √Åvila, Spain In medieval Spain the existence of migratory flocks on the largest scale, which were carefully organised through the system of the Mesta gave rise to orderly drovers' roads, called caba√±eras in Aragon, carreradas in Catalonia, azadores reales, emphasising royal patronage, in Valencia, and most famous of all, ca√±adas, including three major ca√±adas reales, in Castile.H.C. Darby, \\"The face of Europe on the eve of the great discoveries\\", in The New Cambridge Modern History vol. I, 1957:29ff: the section on Spain's medieval drovers' roads depends on Darby. Along these grazing trackways sheep travelled for distances of 350 to 450 miles, to the summer pasturages of the north, around Le√≥n, Soria, Cuenca and Segovia, from the middle of April, and returning to winter pasturage in La Mancha, Estremadura, Alc√°ntara and the lowlands of Andalusia. In Languedoc the transhumance pathways, more restricted by agriculture and orchards and less organized than those of Iberia, were the drailles that fed into the main carra√Øres, which led from coastal plains to summer mountain pastures. They are documented from the 13th century and were organized in the 16th century by Statuts de la transhumance.Ryder 1997:220. In some areas, such as on Mont Loz√®re, the drailles were marked by montjoies (standing stones). In the Kingdom of Naples, patterns of transhumance established in Late Antiquity were codified by Frederick II Hohenstaufen, but the arrival of rulers of Aragon in the 15th century saw the organization of sheepways, tratturi delle pecore on the Aragonese model, and pastoralists were given privileges and restrictions, collectively termed the dogana, that were reminiscent of those of the Mesta. This established drovers' roads that continued without substantial change into the age of the railroad.Darby 1957:31; Angus MacKay, David Ditchburn, Atlas of Medieval Europe 1997:220 map of transhumance trackways in later medieval western Europe.  17th century onwards  By the 17th century Daniel Defoe described Smithfield, in London, as the greatest meat market in the world. In 1855 it was moved to the outskirts of the city, to a site known as the Caledonian Market on Caledonian Road, Islington, to avoid the problems of large numbers of stock being driven through the streets. Cattle were also driven to other major cities, to areas of intermediate grazing to be fattened for market, and to markets and fairs. Many of the greatest stock fairs, such as Tan Hill, Yarnbury and White Sheet in Wiltshire, were held on ancient sites to which cattle were driven for centuries, perhaps since prehistoric times. Geese, turkeys, pigs,and horses and in some cases goats were also driven to markets. Large quantities were driven to London. Cattle were shod with iron shoes, geese could be driven through a pan of tar mixed with sawdust, grit or ground shells or fitted with pads to protect their feet. The feet of turkeys could be tarred and sanded.Haldane (1997) p 34. Daniel Defoe recorded that 150,000 turkeys were driven from East Anglia to London each year, the journey taking three months to complete. There is a record of a wager in 1740 on whether geese or turkeys would travel faster - the winner being the geese which could graze as they moved, while the turkeys had to stop to be fed. Repeatedly regulations were put in place to try and control outbreaks of cattle disease and these included the drovers activities. Penalties of ¬£50 or more could be imposed. During one disease outbreak, drovers were no longer able to take their dogs into Ireland. The regularity of the Welsh trade across Wiltshire is proved by an inscription in Welsh on an old inn (now a private house) in Stockbridge, still visible in the twentieth century: Gwair tymherus porfa flasus (worthwhile grass and a pleasant pasture) and Cwrw da cwal cysurus (good beer and a comfortable shelter). Much of the trade in cattle from Wales to London was done on letters of credit. In 1706 the law was changed specifically to prevent drovers escaping their debts by declaring themselves bankrupt. The trade promoted the development of banking systems in both London and Wales. David Jones, a farmer's son, came into contact with the drovers whilst employed at the King's Head in Llandovery and set up his own Black Ox Bank in Llandovery in 1799, the bank issued its own bank notes. The bank survived until 1909 when it was taken over by Lloyds Bank. Long acre The long acre is a traditional term for wide grassy road verges. In some places, such as Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the British Isles, rural roads are often separated from adjoining paddocks and fields by both a hedge or fence and a wide grass verge. Rather than leaving this verge fallow, farmers often tether livestock on it to use pasture feed (in the form of the grass) that would otherwise be wasted. Historically, the long acre was also grazed by herds or flocks moving from place to place, either on long journeys, or from one small local field to another. The long acre provided an important resource for such flocks and herds, perhaps forming a significant part of a small farmer's pasture. In Australia, the most common method of keeping grazing stock off a road is by the use of a portable electric fence, visible to the stock and to passing travellers as a single white tape. The use of the long acre as pasture has sometimes become formalised. For example, in parts of England, some have been registered as common land. In some cases the herbage of the drove was rented out to local farmers for grazing. The related term long paddock is occasionally encountered in Australia with the same meaning, although the term also has a more specific historical meaning, relating to the cross-country droving of cattle between Queensland and New South Wales along what is now the route of the Cobb Highway. Decline of droving Droving declined during the nineteenth century, through a combination of agricultural change, the introduction of railway transport from the 1840s, cattle disease, and more intensive use of the countryside through which the stock had passed for hundreds of years. For example, importation of cattle from Donaghadee in Ireland to Portpatrick, which would then be driven through Wigtownshire, had reached 20,000 per year in 1812, but fell to 1,080 in 1832, because they came by steamer directly to ports at Liverpool and Glasgow instead.Haldane (1997), Chapter 12: The Decline of the Drove Roads.in Norwich Drovers' rights to occupy a stance and pasture their cattle was also being challenged. The last recorded large-scale cattle drove across Wales was in 1870,Hindle (1993), Chapter 6: Drove roads and packhorse tracks. and of sheep in 1900, although droving briefly revived during the rail strike of 1912. In Scotland, the last drove over the Corrieyairack Pass is believed to have taken place in 1906. Corrieyairack Pass had also been used by droves of cattle and sheep from the Isle of Skye; the last drove from Skye to use the pass occurred \\"in the closing years of the 19th century\\".Haldane (1997), P. 221. When cattle were moved by rail by the North-East railway company, initially the drovers accompanied the stock on the goods train, later they were required to use the passenger trains. Despite the decline in droving, the annual Drovers' Tea in Norwich in 1906 organised by the RSPCA catered for 570. Drovers and other road users could come into conflict. In 1916 a new Order compelled farmers and drovers of cattle, sheep, etc., to carry lamps at the front and rear of herds or flocks, such lamps \\"to be visible for a reasonable distance,\\" and swung to and fro on the approach of any vehicle to indicate the presence of an obstruction on the road.  North America and South America  Cattle drives in North America by American cowboys and South American cattle drivers are similar in nature, although distances were often greater; like most routes they started out by following a general geographic route before becoming roadways.

She initially found commercial success in the mid-1980s with the single \\"So Macho\\" and had several other hits during the decade. In the 2000s, she became known for television appearances, including Loose Women, The Xtra Factor and This Morning. She took part in the ITV show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2011. Her net worth in 2016 was estimated to be ¬£7 million. Early life Sinitta's mother is Miquel Brown, who was a popular American disco-soul singer in the 1970s and 1980s and a member of the cast of Hair; her father is called Anthony. She has a sister Gretta who was adopted by a relative. Sinitta was born and raised in Seattle, and later Detroit, but frequently travelled with her mother on tour including to Sydney, Australia. Her mother then directed the London production of Hair; Sinitta was sent to boarding school in East Sussex, and ballet school in Tunbridge Wells from the age of 9. She auditioned for musical roles in London, performing in The Wiz at age 12 while still in school.  Career  = Early career = In 1981, Sinitta appeared in the film Shock Treatment as Frankie, although she was credited as Sinitta Renet. Sinitta continued her career by appearing in several West End productions, most notably the first production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats. She also later appeared in Little Shop of Horrors. = 1986‚Äì1988: Sinitta! and \\"So Macho\\" = In 1986, Sinitta released the single \\"So Macho\\", which debuted at 59 on the UK charts; the single remained rather low in the charts although in that year, it reached number 16 on the charts, before climbing to number 5 the following week. The subsequent week, \\"So Macho\\" reached number 2 in the UK, scoring its highest position on the charts and also giving Sinitta her first Top 3 charting single. \\"So Macho\\" spent the following six weeks in the Top 20 in the UK. Alongside this success in the UK, \\"So Macho\\" also reached the Top 20 in Sweden, Australia and Austria. \\"So Macho\\" subsequently became the highest charting of Sinitta's entire career. Sinitta's second single \\"Feels Like the First Time\\" was far less commercially successful and also only charted at Number 45. In 1987, Sinitta released the lead single from her upcoming debut album. \\"Toy Boy\\" debuted at number 41 and later climbed to number 4 in the UK, where it remained for three consecutive weeks. The single remained in the Top 20 for eight weeks. The track also reached number 3 in Switzerland, while also reaching the Top 20 in Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Germany. Sinitta then released the second single from the album, \\"GTO\\"; the single reached number 15 on the UK chart. \\"GTO\\" also became Sinitta's first hit in Spain, reaching number 3. The track reached number 11 in Switzerland, number 9 in Norway and number 13 in Ireland. Sinitta later released her debut album Sinitta!, which performed moderately, charting at number 34 in the UK. This album also reached number 69 in Australia. In 1988, Sinitta released \\"Cross My Broken Heart\\", taken from Sinitta!, which reached number 6 in the UK and number 7 in Ireland. The track also charted at number 12 in Spain, thus becoming her second Top 20 single in Spain. Sinitta then released \\"I Don't Believe In Miracles\\", which reached number 22 in the UK. = 1989‚Äì1990: Wicked and \\"Right Back Where We Started From\\" = In 1989, Sinitta moved away from working directly with producers Stock Aitken Waterman. However, she did continue to work with Pete Hammond, Phil Harding and Ian Curnow with PWL, in co-operation with German producer Ralf-Ren√© Mau√© who was responsible for such hits of the Hamburg-based eurodisco duo London Boys as \\"Harlem Desire'\\", \\"Requiem\\" and \\"London Nights\\". The second album was confirmed as Wicked. The lead single of the album was \\"Right Back Where We Started From\\", which debuted at number 19 in the UK and rose to number 6. The following week the track climbed to number 4 in the UK, holding this position for the subsequent week. For the subsequent four weeks, the single remained in the Top 40. It also charted across the rest of Europe, notably reaching number 7 in Finland and the Top 40 in Denmark, Spain and Germany. \\"Right Back Where We Started From\\" also charted successfully in Oceania, reaching number 7 in Australia and number 2 in New Zealand, thus becoming her highest charting single in both countries. In addition to this success, the track made the year-end charts, at number 45 in Australia, number 38 in New Zealand and number 49 in the UK. As a follow-up single, Sinitta released \\"Love on a Mountain Top\\", which charted at number 20 in the UK and number 81 in Australia. The final lead single of the album, however, was the least successful out of the three, failing to chart at all. In 1990, Sinitta released the single \\"Hitchin' a Ride\\", which performed moderately, charting at number 20 in the UK, whilst \\"Love and Affection\\" peaked at number 62. = 1992‚Äì1997: \\"Shame Shame Shame\\" and \\"Naughty Naughty\\" = In July 1992, \\"Shame Shame Shame\\" debuted at number 31 in the UK, and later peaked at number 28. The following April, Sinitta released the single \\"The Supreme\\", which charted at number 49 in the UK. In 1995, Sinitta released a covers album called Naughty Naughty, which was also the only album of hers to be released in Asia. She appeared on the cast recording album for What a Feeling, a live recording taken from the Apollo Playhouse Theatre, Edinburgh, in May 1997, and replaced Irene Cara to tour with Sonia (a fellow former SAW artist) and Luke Goss (formerly of Bros) in the rock and pop musicals concert, What a Feeling the same year. = 2004‚Äì2016: The X Factor era, television and judging = In 2004, Sinitta made her premiere appearance on The X Factor in the first series, when she assisted Simon Cowell at the Judges' Houses stage, helping to select his final three acts for the live show, with the eventual winner being Steve Brookstein. In 2005, Sinitta helped Cowell once more, this time choosing the final three groups. In 2006, she helped Cowell select Leona Lewis, who became the second winner chosen by them, with Lewis becoming one of the most successful acts from the show. In 2009, Sinitta returned to the show again for the Judges' Houses stage, and then helped to choose Olly Murs. In 2007, Sinitta became a judge on the ITV show Grease Is the Word. The following year, Sinitta joined the cast of the daytime ITV show Loose Women as a presenter. In 2010, Sinitta helped Cowell again by choosing One Direction who have since become the biggest act to have come out of the X Factor. In 2011, however, Sinitta assisted Louis Walsh for the first time, rather than Cowell. In November that year, Sinitta was confirmed to be taking part in the eleventh series of I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! as one of the contestants and would be entering the jungle on Day 3.

The station is on the Chiltern Main Line between and . History left The station was opened on 22 July 1912,Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley page53 at the request of the Golf Club, which had opened the previous year. It is on what was the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, which had been opened in 1906. The station was originally called Denham Golf Club Platform, and it was built to serve the adjacent golf club. Between the two World Wars the platforms were lengthened and the station was made a halt. The original \\"up\\" platform was on the London side of the road bridge, and made of wood, with an access path connecting to the track leading to the Golf Club. In 1954Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley page 53 British Railways had a new concrete \\"up\\" platform built on the Wycombe side of the road bridge, opposite the \\"down\\" platform, which was also rebuilt in concrete. At the same time a proposed name change to 'Higher Denham' was rejected. The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974. The two waiting rooms are original Great Western Railway \\"pagoda\\" shelters. The ticket office, at road level on the down side, was also a pagoda building. Both waiting rooms and the original ticket office have been listed buildings since 27 November 1992, to prevent their replacement by the bus shelter type structures then being installed at other stations on the line. The ticket office was damaged by fire in 2005 and demolished early in 2007. It was replaced with a near replica in 2007, but unlike the original the new building has no clerk's window. The waiting rooms have recently been repainted to match the ticket office. The original platform lamp-posts were cast iron, marked with the initials \\"G.W. & G.C. Jt\\" of the original operator. The lamp-posts were removed when the station lighting ‚Äî and indeed the whole line ‚Äî were modernised in about 1991, at about the time as the new Class 165 diesel multiple unit trains entered service. The station was closed between 16 March to 19 June 2015 to allow Network Rail to undertake major repairs. Services The typical off-peak service pattern at Denham Golf Club consists of one train per hour each way, to and from . This drops to one train every 2 hours each way on Sundays.Timetables - Chiltern Railways] The station's service pattern is unusual in that it is served by trains on two completely different routes in either direction. Southbound services originate at and call at nearly all intermediate stations (the exact stopping pattern varies depending on the day). On northbound services, however, Denham Golf Club is the first calling point after London Marylebone; these trains then continue past Gerrards Cross, stopping at most intermediate stations before finally terminating at . The respective corresponding services in the opposite direction pass through this station non-stop. This means that the only stations to receive direct, regular, all-day services both to and from Denham Golf Club are London Marylebone (the terminus) and Gerrards Cross (the next station to the north). Denham Golf Club is a Penalty Fares station with automatic ticket facilities but no ticket office. The station is unstaffed.

The source of the river is Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture to the north. The Yodo River, usually called the Seta River in Shiga Prefecture, begins at the southern outlet of the lake in ≈åtsu. There is a dam there to regulate the lake level. Further downstream, the Seta flows into Kyoto Prefecture and its name changes to the Uji River. It then merges with two other rivers, the Katsura River and the Kizu River in Kyoto Prefecture. The Katsura has its headwaters in the mountains of Kyoto Prefecture, while the Kizu comes from Mie Prefecture. From the three-river confluence, the river is called the Yodo River, which flows south, through Osaka, and on into Osaka Bay. In Osaka, part of the river has been diverted into an artificial channel; the old course in the heart of Osaka is called the Ky≈´-Yodo River (literally, 'Former Yodo River'). It serves as a source of water for irrigation and also powers hydroelectric generators. History The choice of the ancient capital Heian-ky≈ç (now Kyoto) during the Heian period, was partly chosen because of the presence of the Yodo river that flows towards Osaka, and its outlet on the Seto Inland Sea. The river played a very important role for the movement and transport of goods between Osaka and Kyoto, until the arrival of the first trains in the 1870s. In 1858 it is estimated there were 50 boats daily of all types that carried about 1,500 people from Osaka to Fushimi. In the 19th century, a trip to Steamboat between Osaka and Fushimi could take 12 hours.E.

The technique was superseded by multiplexing via HTTP/2, which is supported by most modern browsers. As of 2018, HTTP pipelining is not enabled by default in modern browsers, due to several issues including buggy proxy servers and HOL blocking. Motivation and limitations The pipelining of requests results in a dramatic improvement in the loading times of HTML pages, especially over high latency connections such as satellite Internet connections. The speedup is less apparent on broadband connections, as the limitation of HTTP 1.1 still applies: the server must send its responses in the same order that the requests were received‚Äîso the entire connection remains first-in-first-out and HOL blocking can occur. The asynchronous operation of HTTP/2 and SPDY are solutions for this. Browsers ultimately did not enable pipelining by default, and by 2017 most browsers supported HTTP/2 by default which used multiplexing instead. Non-idempotent requests, like those using POST, should not be pipelined. Sequences of GET and HEAD requests can always be pipelined. A sequence of other idempotent requests like PUT and DELETE can be pipelined or not depending on whether requests in the sequence depend on the effect of others. HTTP pipelining requires both the client and the server to support it. HTTP/1.1 conforming servers are required to support pipelining. This does not mean that servers are required to pipeline responses, but that they are required not to fail if a client chooses to pipeline requests. Implementation status Pipelining was introduced in HTTP/1.1 and was not present in HTTP/1.0. =Implementation in web servers= Implementing pipelining in web servers is a relatively simple matter of making sure that network buffers are not discarded between requests. For that reason, most modern web servers handle pipelining without any problem. =Implementation in web browsers= Of all the major browsers, only Opera based on Presto layout engine had a fully working implementation that was enabled by default. In all other browsers HTTP pipelining is disabled or not implemented. *Internet Explorer 8 does not pipeline requests, due to concerns regarding buggy proxies and head-of-line blocking. *Internet Explorer 11 does not support pipelining. *Mozilla browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino) support pipelining; however, it is disabled by default.Pipelining Network MozillaZine Pipelining is disabled by default to avoid issues with misbehaving servers. When pipelining is enabled, Mozilla browsers use some heuristics, especially to turn pipelining off for older IIS servers. Support for H1 Pipeline was removed from Mozilla Firefox in Version 54. *Konqueror 2.0 supports pipelining, but disabled by default. *Google Chrome previously supported pipelining, but it has been disabled due to bugs and problems with poorly behaving servers.HTTP Pipelining - The Chromium Projects *Pale Moon (web browser) supports pipelining, and is enabled by default =Implementation in web proxies= Most HTTP proxies do not pipeline outgoing requests. Some versions of the Squid web proxy will pipeline up to two outgoing requests. This functionality has been disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled for \\"bandwidth management and access logging reasons.\\" Squid supports multiple requests from clients. The Polipo proxy pipelines outgoing requests. Tempesta FW, an open source application delivery controller, also pipelines requests to backend servers. =Other implementations= The libwww library made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), supports pipelining since version 5.1 released at 18 February 1997.

Howell was decorated with the Victoria Cross following his actions during the Second Battle of Bullecourt, in which he ran along the parapet of a trench bombing the German forces attacking his position through the use of grenades, and thus driving them back. Born in a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Howell was employed as a builder before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in June 1915. Allotted to the force's 1st Battalion, he served at Gallipoli prior to transferring to the Western Front. Participating in the Somme offensive of 1916, Howell was wounded at Pozi√®res and promoted to corporal in early 1917. During an attack on a German held village, he led a rifle bombing section and was awarded the Military Medal for his actions. Severely wounded in his Victoria Cross action, Howell underwent a prolonged hospitalisation period before returning to Australia and receiving his discharge on medical grounds. Settling in Coogee, he gained employment by working on the advertising staff of several newspapers. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Howell served with the Australian Eastern Command Headquarters but soon sought his discharge and enlisted with the United States Sea Transport Service. He died in 1964 at the age of 71. Early life Howell was born in the Sydney suburb of Enfield, New South Wales, on 19 November 1893, the fourth son of English-born carpenter, Francis John Howell, and his Australian wife, Martha (n√©e Sweeny). Howell was educated at Croydon Park and Burwood Public Schools, before receiving an apprenticeship as a bricklayer. Becoming a builder, he was employed in his native Enfield area of Sydney. First World War On 3 June 1915, Howell enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War. Allotted to the 7th Reinforcements of the 1st Battalion as a private, he embarked from Sydney for Egypt on 14 July aboard HMAT Orsova. Joining the 1st Battalion at Gallipoli on 1 November, Howell served on the peninsula until the Allied evacuation the following month. Returning to Egypt, the battalion spent several months training in the desert in preparation for service on the Western Front. The 1st Battalion embarked for France in March 1916, and by April the unit was entrenched in the Fromelles sector. In the third week of July, Howell was wounded in the Battle of Pozi√®res while taking part in the Somme offensive. Evacuated to a hospital in Sheffield, England, during early August, Howell attended a training school before returning to his battalion on 26 November. Appointed lance corporal on 10 December, he was promoted to corporal on 6 February 1917. Private George J. Howell c.1915 On 9 April 1917, Howell took part in the 1st Battalion's attack on the German held village of Demicourt. During the engagement, Howell led a rifle bombing section at the forefront of his company against the German position. The section was held up several times in their advance due to heavy machine gun fire, but managed to overcome the opposition and continue the advance each time. For his actions during the battle, Howell was awarded the Military Medal, the recommendation of which cited his \\"... courage and devotion to duty ... was of great assistance to his company in the capture of its objectives\\". The notification of the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 26 May 1917. =Victoria Cross= In preparation for an attack on the Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt, the 1st Australian Brigade‚Äîof which the 1st Battalion was part‚Äîwas attached to the 2nd Australian Division. The attack commenced in the morning of 3 May 1917, with the 2nd Division lined up in conjunction with thirteen other divisions. Despite some progress made early in the attack, the Australian forces were soon held up by strong opposition, and in the evening the 1st Battalion was entrenched in the old German line known as 'OG1'. Three of the battalion's companies occupied the line, while a fourth was placed in reserve. Their position was such that they occupied a wedge into the German line, while two flanks were in German held territory. From the initial attack, only the Canadians on the extreme right and the 3rd Australian Brigade on the extreme left were able to capture and hold their set objectives. Over the course of the next three days, severe fighting took place and further troops were drawn in to hold and extend the gains of 3 May. On 6 May, the Germans launched a counter-attack which forced the 3rd Brigade to withdraw from their trenches; it was during this engagement that Howell was to perform the act which was to earn him the Victoria Cross. King George V during an investiture on 21 July 1917. At 06:00, Howell, who was in charge of a post to the right of the line, noticed the battalion on the right flank was being forced out of its trench and was beginning to retire. Immediately alerting battalion headquarters, Captain Alexander MacKenzie‚Äîwho had assumed temporary command of the battalion‚Äîhurriedly organised a group of non-combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a road bank in order to fend off the expected German advance. A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion, Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along the trench line throwing bombs down on the Germans, all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb attack. Forcing the Germans back along the trench, Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along the trench firing bursts from his Lewis Gun. Soon exhausting his supply of bombs, Howell began to attack with his bayonet until he fell into the trench wounded. Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire, and when he was brought into the clearing station some hours later, it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty-eight separate wounds. Due to his actions, the ground which had been lost was soon retaken, and the German attack was later repulsed. The full citation for Howell's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette on 27 June 1917, reading: =Hospitalisation and repatriation= Howell's multiple wounds at Bullecourt required a prolonged hospitalisation period for treatment, and he was sent to the Norfolk and Norwich War Hospital in England. On 21 July 1917, Howell was invested with his Victoria Cross and Military Medal by King George V in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. A photograph of the pair together was taken at this time, and later published in the Times History of the War. Promoted to sergeant, Howell returned to Australia on 31 October. Having not adequately recovered from his wounds, he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 5 June 1918 on medical grounds. Howell's father and one of his brothers had also served on the Western Front during the First World War; his father with the 54th Battalion and his brother, Frederick, with the 1st Pioneer Battalion. Later life A group of Victoria Cross recipients lined up to march in the 1927 Melbourne Anzac Day march. Howell is on the right, second row. On 1 March 1919, Howell married Sadie Lillian Yates, a nurse, at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church in Sydney. The pair settled in Coogee, where Howell was employed on the advertising staff of Smith's Newspapers Ltd and later the Bulletin Newspaper Co. Pty Ltd. By 1933, he was the New South Wales representative for the Brisbane Standard and the Queensland Worker. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Howell once again offered his services and enlisted in the Australian Army on 14 October 1939. Posted to Eastern Command Headquarters, Paddington, he was granted the rank of staff sergeant, but found staff work to be dull and sought his discharge in February 1941. In August 1944, Howell enlisted in the United States Army for service in the United States Sea Transport Service, and was thus able to participate in the invasion of Leyte at the commencement of the Philippines campaign.

Accompanied by his grandson, the journey took four days by train before the pair arrived in the Perth suburb of Applecross, where Howell was to live with his married daughter, Norma. He later moved to Gunyidi, via Watheroo, where he was to reside for a few years before returning to Perth. In 1956, he joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London's Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the Victoria Cross. Howell died at the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, Perth, on 23 December 1964. He was granted a funeral with military honours, before his body was cremated and his ashes interred at Karrakatta Cemetery, Perth. Howell's name is commemorated by a plaque in the Western Australian Garden of Remembrance, and his Victoria Cross and other medals are on display at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

His better known works include The Custom House, the Four Courts, King's Inns in Dublin and Emo Court in County Laois.  Early life  Gandon was born on 20 February 1742 in New Bond Street, London, at the house of his grandfather Peter Gandon, a French Huguenot refugee. He was the only son of Peter Gandon (b. 1713), a gunmaker, and Jane Burchall (possibly n√©e Wynne).Frederick O'Dwyer, 'Gandon, James (1742‚Äì1823)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 From 1749 he was educated at Shipley's Drawing AcademyDuffy, p. 18 where he studied the classics, mathematics, arts and architecture. On leaving the drawing academy he was articled to study architecture in the office of Sir William Chambers. Chambers was an advocate of the neoclassical evolution of Palladian architecture, although he later made designs in the Gothic Revival style. However, it was Chambers's palladian and neoclassical concepts which most influenced the young Gandon.Duffy, pp. 29‚Äì39 In 1765, Gandon left William Chambers to begin practice on his own. His first commission was on Sir Samuel Hellier's estate at the Wodehouse, near Wombourne. Gandon's new practice, whilst successful, always remained small. In about 1769 he entered an architectural competition to design the new Royal Exchange in Dublin. The plan eventually chosen was by Thomas Cooley. However, Gandon's design came second and brought him to the attention of the politicians who were overseeing the large-scale redevelopment of Dublin, one of the largest cities in Europe at the time. During the following years in England, Gandon was responsible for the design of the County Hall in Nottingham. Between 1769 and 1771, he collaborated with John Woolfe on two additional volumes of Vitruvius Britannicus, a book of plans and drawings of Palladian revival buildings by such architects as Inigo Jones and Colen Campbell. During his English career he was awarded the Gold medal for architecture by the Royal Academy, London in 1768.Duffy, pp. 62‚Äì67 In 1771 he was paid five guineas ‚Ä≥To making of a design of a Theater at Wynnstay‚Ä≥ He was also paid nine guineas for giving ‚Ä≥36 Lessons in Architecture‚Ä≥ to Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. The Theatre was converted from a huge kitchen which had been built for the stupendous Coming of Age Celebrations of Sir Watkin in that year and was used from 1771 until Sir Watkin died. The British Library has a drawing of the Theatre which was used for an admission ticket for a performance which belonged to King George 111. The Wynnstay Papers at The National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth.  Designing the Custom House  Custom House by night In 1780 Gandon declined an invitation from a member of the Romanov family to work in St. Petersburg but in 1781, at the age of 38, he accepted an invitation to Ireland from Lord Carlow and John Beresford (the Revenue Commissioner for Ireland) to supervise the construction of the new Custom House in Dublin.The Four Courts Thomas Cooley, the original architect on that project, had died and Gandon was chosen to assume complete control. The new Custom House was unpopular with Dublin Corporation and some city merchants who complained that it moved the axis of the city, would leave little room for shipping, and it was being built on what at the time was a swamp.Sarah Atkinson, Essays, 1896. p.402 It is said that the Irish people were so opposed to the Custom House and its associated taxes that Beresford had to smuggle Gandon into the country and keep him hidden in his own home for the first three months. The project was eventually completed at a cost of ¬£200,000, an enormous sum at the time.Duffy, pp. 126‚Äì158 The 'House of Lord's Entrance' part of Gandon's extension to Edward Lovett Pearce's Irish Houses of Parliament. The great portico is flanked by a curved screen wall This conspicuous commission proved to be the turning point in Gandon's career and Dublin was to become Gandon's home and its architecture his \\"raison d'etre\\" for the remainder of his life. He took a house in Mecklenburgh Street (now Railway Street), that he might be near the residence of John Beresford, the main proponent for the development of the city. The city, which in Gandon's lifetime was to grow to become the fifth largest city in Europe, was undergoing vast expansion, mostly following the Palladian and neoclassical designs already popularised in the city by Edward Lovett Pearce and Richard Cassels. The newly formed Wide Streets Commission employed Gandon to design a new aristocratic enclave in the vicinity of Mountjoy Square and Gardiner Street. The new classical terraces of large residences became the Town houses of members of the newly built and imposing Irish Houses of Parliament situated in College Green south of the river. Gandon also designed Carlisle Bridge (now O'Connell Bridge) over the River Liffey to join the north and south areas of the city.  Other Irish works  The King's Inn, Dublin, 1800‚Äì1808, later completed by Francis Johnston Gandon's other works in the city included: *The Four Courts of 1786, *The centre portion of King's Inns Henrietta Street begun in 1795 and completed in 1816 by his pupil Henry Aaron Baker, *The improvement of the Rotunda Assembly rooms 1786. Gandon's least well known building in Dublin is his Royal Military Infirmary of 1787 on Infirmary Road. He worked for the Wide Street Commissioners and designed the facades for the shops at ground floor of D'Olier Street, Burgh Quay and some surrounding streets. One of his most prestigious commissions, which came in 1785, was to extend Pearce's monumental Houses of Parliament, for which he built the (well known today) curved screen wall which links his new corinthian portico for the House of Lords facing College Street to Pearce's original building. This building is now the Bank of Ireland. The Four Courts by James Gandon His work in Ireland was not confined to Dublin, nor to civic and municipal commissions. In 1784 he designed the new courthouse and Gaol in Broad Street (Demolished) in Waterford; and he also worked on many private houses, including Abbeville, Dublin which he designed for John Beresford in 1792,Duffy, pp. 180‚Äì203 Emsworth, Malahide, County Dublin in 1794 for James Woodmason, a London stationer who became involved in banking in Dublin,Robin Hamlyn. ‚ÄúAn Irish Shakespeare Gallery.‚Äù The Burlington Magazine Vol. 120, No. 8, Issue No. 905 (August 1978), pp. 515-529.

In County Laois, he designed Emo Court, County Laois in 1790‚Äì96 for the Earl of Portarlington, and also Coolbanagher Church of Ireland Church just outside Emo village. His town planning work included creating a new setting for the Custom House with a curved terrace of townhouses at Beresfort Place, Dublin, and the New Geneva town in County Waterford which was never completed. He designed a number of buildings including walled gardens, and farm buildings at Carriglass just outside Longford Town.  Criticism and decline  The success of Gandon's designs and commissions were however not reflected in personal popularity: he attracted huge criticism from his enemies. So hated was the taxation symbolised by the Custom House that the stigma of being its creator was to taint the appreciation of his work throughout his lifetime. It was even claimed that Gandon was designing buildings to boost his self-esteem. In the 1780s, during the construction of the Four Courts, one broadsheet published daily letters from a correspondent castigating and insulting Gandon and his designs. This further fostered the hate directed against him. In truth Gandon had merely rediscovered what architects from Vitruvius to Thomas Jefferson believed, which was that the Palladian form was eminently suitable for the design of public buildings where huge civic prestige was required. In 1798, revolution broke out on the streets of Ireland and Gandon, an unpopular figure, hurriedly fled to London. On returning to Dublin he found a much changed city. The Irish Houses of Parliament, which had inspired the great period of development, were closed. The 1801 Act of Union had placed Ireland directly under rule from London. One by one the Anglo-Irish aristocracy left their fine new town houses in the city. As a direct result Dublin declined from being one of the great cities of Europe.Duffy, pp. 203‚Äì258 Gandon had married Eleanor Smullen in 1770; sadly, he was widowed shortly after his invitation to Dublin, but while they were in London the couple had six children. James Gandon died in 1823 at his home in Lucan, County Dublin, having spent forty-two years in the city. He was buried in the church-yard of Drumcondra Church, in the same grave as his friend the antiquary Francis Grose.John H. Farrant, 'Grose, Francis (bap. 1731, d. 1791)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2009 It seems that already by the time of his death his reputation was undergoing a re-evaluation, for his tomb-stone reads: ‚Äì \\"Such was the respect in which Gandon was held by his neighbours and friends from around his home in Lucan that they refused carriages and walked the 16 miles to and from Drumcondra on the day of his funeral.\\" In the years since his death, Ireland's troubled history has resulted in destruction and damage to much of Gandon's work, especially his interiors. The Custom House was burnt down in 1921 by the IRA during the War of Independence and parts of it were rebuilt using a darker shade of native limestone.Michael Collins: A Life by James A. Mackay (), page 199 The Four Courts was shelled by government forces during the Civil War in 1922 and partly destroyed by a huge explosion. Even though it was later rebuilt, much of Gandon's original work is gone and the interior can today only be appreciated from his original drawings. The wings to the Four Courts were shortened by one bay, in order to widen the roadway, and to permit more lanes of traffic. This alteration seriously damages the original composition. Yet despite this, the stamp of his work is still clearly visible in Georgian Dublin today.

Born in Milford Haven, he left school at 13 to work in a local fish market. He enlisted in the Welsh Regiment in 1914 and, after serving briefly in France, he was reposted to the Macedonian front of the First World War. During a night raid on German trenches, despite being wounded twice, he single-handedly captured three enemy soldiers before carrying a wounded officer back to safety under artillery fire. For his actions he was awarded the Victoria Cross, becoming the youngest Welsh recipient of the award. He later performed a similar feat when carrying a captain to safety in 1918 during an assault on an enemy position. After the war, he returned to Milford Haven where he married and raised three children. He continued working in the local fish market, first as a trader before becoming the foreman for an ice company at the site for over 40 years. He served in the Home Guard during the Second World War. Prior to his death in 1977, he was the last surviving Welsh Victoria Cross recipient from the First World War. Early life Lewis was born on 1 May 1896 in Robert Street in the coastal town of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire. He was the second of four children born to Adrian Lewis, a brass moulder and fitter at Milford Haven docks, and his wife Sarah (n√©e Broome). His father was known as \\"Stokey\\" Lewis and Hubert became known as \\"Young Stokey\\" as a child before taking on the original nickname as he grew older. The family later moved to 27 Dartmouth Gardens and Lewis attended Milford Haven National School as well as a Wesleyan Sunday School. After leaving school at the age of 13, Lewis went to work as a packer in the town's fish market for local businessman George Bradbury. A local newspaper reporter described him as an \\"unpredictable prankster\\" and recounted incidents where Lewis lightly nicked the reporter with a fish knife and where he once \\"swiped\\" the editor of the Western Telegraph with a hake. He also played amateur football for local side Milford Haven Stars. First World War In early September 1914, 18-year old Lewis attended a recruitment meeting organised by a Major Birt, who was also his father's employer, which drew crowds of 2000‚Äì3000 people before enlisting in the 11th (Service) Battalion of the Welsh Regiment which had been formed little over a month before as the Cardiff Commercial Battalion, a pals unit. At 10 a.m. the next day, Lewis, was one of 75 local volunteers who left Milford Haven before being split into smaller groups with Lewis and 45 others travelling to Maindy Barracks in Cardiff, the rest joining the Royal Engineers or the Royal Artillery. Two days later, his unit was moved to Lewes as part of the 67th Brigade. He also underwent training at Eastbourne, Hastings, Aldershot and Seaford. On 5 September 1915, just over a year after enlisting, Lewis and his unit sailed to Boulogne, France from Southampton. Several days after his arrival, he was attached to the 9th Border Regiment as a machine gunner. =Victoria Cross= Soon after, Bulgaria entered the war on the German side. Lewis' regiment was one of several that were removed from the Western Front and posted to Greece to prepare for a possible attack by enemy forces on the Macedonian front under the command of Lieutenant-General Bryan Mahon of the British Salonika Army. The force initially entrenched themselves in the Thessaloniki area in preparation for an attack but the decision was eventually made to launch an offense against the enemy forces. On 17 October 1916, the order was given for Lewis' battalion to launch a raid on German trenches near Dorsale. However, bad weather delayed the attack for several days before it was eventually launched at 9 p.m. on 22 October. The battalion was split into four parties with Lewis assigned to \\"D\\" Party. During the initial rush, D Party was spotted by a German sentry after crossing only of ground, allowing the enemy forces to open fire with machine guns and artillery. They were targeted by \\"intense\\" shelling for 40 minutes during which Lewis received a wound to his arm. However, he turned away medical assistance after seeing more badly wounded men needing attention. During a brief respite in the shelling, Captain Guthrie Morgan led a charge of around 150 men, including Lewis, into the German trenches where they were able to gain control after a period of hand-to-hand combat. During the fighting, Lewis received a second wound as the Germans attempted to counterattack but refused treatment for a second time. He continued through the enemy trench where he came across three German soldiers. Using his rifle butt and bayonet, Lewis briefly fought with the men before they surrendered to him, in an incident witnessed by Captain Morgan and another soldier. The German forces launched another counterattack, this time successful, and Lewis and his battalion were ordered to retreat. In the descent back to their lines, Lewis heard the cries of a wounded officer, Lieutenant Turner, who was lying on the fire step of a trench, and, despite suffering from two wounds himself, carried the wounded soldier over his shoulder the rest of the way through enemy artillery fire. They reached safety at 4:30 a.m. the following morning at which point Lewis let down Turner before collapsing though exhaustion. For his actions, Lewis was awarded for the Victoria Cross (VC). His award was announced on 15 December 1916 in the London Gazette, the citation reading: Lewis returning to Milford Haven Lewis returned home in January 1917, attending a press conference at The Grand Hotel in Cardiff where he stated \\"I joined The Welsh Regiment as a raw recruit, and I am proud of the fact that I have not disgraced the honour and proud record of the regiment.\\" He also corrected errors in the reporting of his actions, including the number of wounds he had received which had initially been reported as three. He later returned to his hometown Milford Haven, where he was given a gold watch, before receiving his VC from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 5 February 1917. At the age of 20, he was the youngest Welsh recipient of the award. =Later actions= Only ten days after being awarded his VC, Lewis returned to the front lines of the Balkans campaign. In June 1918, Lewis again received praise for his bravery under fire when he rescued Captain Morgan during an assault near Salonika. After seeing his captain fall, he rushed to his aid despite suffering the effects of poisonous gas and fighting off nearby Bulgarian troops. He then carried Morgan back to safety. Morgan later wrote to Lewis and stated \\"It is impossible for me to express how grateful I am to you for saving my life‚Ä¶You certainly deserve a Bar to your Victoria Cross.\\" However, he was not put forward for the award, only one other soldier (Noel Godfrey Chavasse) received a second VC during the First World War. He was also awarded the M√©daille militaire by France in July 1917. He was promoted to lance corporal on 16 April 1919. Later life At the end of the hostilities, Lewis returned to his hometown Milford Haven and continued work at the fish market where he worked as a merchant before his employer went out of business during the 1920s. He took several jobs in order to earn a living before again returning to the fish market to work for an ice company, unloading delivery lorries. He eventually became the foreman for the company at the site where he worked for a further 43 years and was locally known by the nickname \\"VC Lewis\\". Lewis married his fianc√©e, Edith Eveline Etherington, in Haverfordwest on 9 October 1920 and the couple had three sons, Edward, Vernon and Arthur. During the Second World War he served in the Home Guard and was given a Certificate of Good Service. One of his sons, Vernon, a flight sergeant in the RAF, was killed in a nighttime bombing raid over Germany in August 1943 at the age of 22; his Avro Lancaster was shot down by an enemy night fighter. Lewis subsequently received his son's posthumous Distinguished Flying Medal from King George VI in May 1946. He also suffered further loss during the 1960s when his grandson was accidentally killed by a reversing bus. Lewis became active in the veteran community and became friends with fellow VC recipient Ivor Rees. In 1964, the pair, along with another VC recipient, Edward Thomas Chapman, attended the film premiere of Zulu where they dined with Michael Caine. His wife Edith died in 1969. Lewis died eight years later in his hometown of Milford Haven on 22 February 1977 at the age of 80. He was buried in St. Katherine's Cemetery next to his wife. Prior to his death, he was the last surviving Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross from the First World War. Lewis's medals, including his VC, were sold at a Sotheby's auction in 1993 for ¬£26,450. They were later bought by Lord Ashcroft in 1999 and his VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

There is a statue of Jones at Runcorn War Memorial. Biography Thomas Alfred Jones Jones was born in Runcorn, Cheshire, on 25 December 1880, and was a private in the 1st Battalion, The Cheshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War. He was known affectionately locally as 'Todger' Jones. On 25 September 1916, during the Battle of Morval, Jones performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He was with his company covering the advance in front of a village, when he noticed an enemy sniper away. He left his trench on his own, and crossed no man's land without covering fire. Although one bullet went through his helmet and another through his coat, he returned the sniper's fire and killed him. Near the enemy trench, he saw two more Germans firing on him while simultaneously displaying a white flag. Jones shot them both. Upon reaching the enemy trench, he found several occupied dug-outs and single-handedly disarmed 102 Germans. Three or four were officers, and the entire trench was taken by Jones and his comrades. Jones is buried in Runcorn Cemetery and his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Cheshire Military Museum in Chester. Statue Dignitaries in front of the statue following its unveiling On 3 August 2014 a statue of Jones was unveiled in the Memorial Garden, Runcorn. Following a ceremony in front of the War Memorial opposite to the garden, the statue was unveiled by four veterans and active servicemen. It is in bronze, and was created by the Scottish sculptor David Annand.

A soldier with Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions on 1 October 1918, during the Battle of the Canal du Nord. Earlier in the war he had been awarded the Military Medal. Early life William Merrifield was born at Brentwood, Essex in England on 9 October 1890. He emigrated to Canada for employment, settling in Ottawa. He later moved to Sudbury, where he worked as a fireman on the Canadian Pacific Railway. He also joined the 97th Regiment, known as the Algonquin Rifles, a unit of Canada's militia. First World War On 23 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, Merrifield enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), being posted to the 2nd Battalion. He fought at the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, and two years later was transferred to the CEF's 4th Battalion, part of the 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division. He participated in the Battle of Passchendaele, and for his conduct during the fighting was awarded the Military Medal (MM). On 1 October 1918, along with the rest of the 1st Division, the 4th Battalion was engaged in the Battle of the Canal du Nord, advancing near Abancourt, north of Cambrai. However, the flanking British division had failed to progress its own front, and the Canadians were exposed to machine-gun fire. Merrifield, now a sergeant and leading a platoon, made a solo foray to deal with two machine-gun posts. Despite being wounded, he was successful in his endeavours and resumed the advance with his platoon. It was not until he was again wounded that he was treated for his wounds. He was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read as follows: King George V presented Merrifield with a VC on 26 January 1919, in a ceremony at York Cottage in Sandringham. He returned to Canada a few months later and was discharged from the CEF. Later life Sergeant William Merrifield Armoury in Brantford, Ontario Resuming to civilian life, Merrifield remained in the militia, in which he was now a lieutenant. In late 1919, he accompanied the then Prince Edward for part of his royal tour of Canada. Two years later, Merrifield married Maude and the couple lived in Sault Ste. Marie, in Ontario. In 1939, he suffered a stroke. His health never recovered and he died in a hospital in Toronto on 8 August 1943. He is buried in West Korah Cemetery in Sault Ste. Marie. A school in Sault Ste. Marie was named after him in recognition of his service to his country although it was closed in 2015. The armoury of the 56th Field Artillery Regiment in Brantford, Ontario, is also named for Merrifield. Grave of Canadian Victoria Cross recipient William Merrifield in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario (Canada) Victoria Cross In addition to the VC and MM, Merrifield was also entitled to the 1914‚Äì15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal.

Details Lewis was born in Herefordshire, but moved to South Wales to find work. On the outbreak of the Great War he was employed by the Great Western Railway as a bus driver at Neath. he joined up in March 1915. The GWR has no record of Lewis on its Rolls of Honour or War memorials, and it may be that he joined up without the company's agreement, and thus lost his post and pension rights. By September 1918 he was 23 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 6th Battalion, The Northamptonshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 18 September 1918 at Rossnoy, near Lempire, France, Lance-Corporal Lewis was in command of a section on the right of the attacking line, held up by intense machine-gun fire. He saw that two guns were enfilading the line and crawled forward alone, successfully bombed the guns and by rifle fire made the whole team surrender. On 21 September he rushed his company through the enemy barrage, but was killed while getting his men under cover from heavy machine-gun fire. Further information Lance- Corporal Lewis is remembered on the Vis-en-Artois memorial near Vis-en-Artois British Cemetery, Haucourt as he has no known grave.CWGC entry The medal was handed to Lance-Corporal's Lewis's elder brother Frank by their mother. She made him promise that the medal would never be sold as she said that she lost a son, and she considered any profit from it would be blood money. Frank kept the medal in his home until his death. It was then agreed by the children of Frank that as he still had a brother, alive, he could hold the medal for his remaining days and then it was to be placed in a museum, either the regimental or local Hereford. When this brother died, the medal was assumed to be part of his estate and was kept by sole beneficiary of the will. Despite requests from Frank's close family, the medal was not returned and therefore not put into a museum. On the centenary of Lewis' sacrifice a number of events took place to honour him. On September 18th 2018 two plaques honouring Allan Lewis (one in English and one in Welsh) were unveiled at Neath Station, by his great niece, Dawn Lewis. The Railway Heritage Trust funded these plaques. On September 21st 2018, the exact centenary of his death, a bronze statue of Lewis was unveiled in Hereford's Old Market Shopping Centre. The statue was designed by Jemma Pearson, and was unveiled by Her Majesty's Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire, The Dowager Countess of Darnley. The statue was funded by the A L Lewis VC Memorial Fund, the chair of which is Dawn Lewis. In addition to the statue, a memorial plaque was dedicated to Allan in the Lady Arbour at Hereford Cathedral. At about the same time the modern Great Western Railway named one of its new InterCity bi-mode trains after Allan Lewis, recognizing him despite the predecessor company having not done so.

Inwood enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in August 1914, and along with the rest of the 10th Battalion, he landed at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915. He fought at Anzac until being evacuated sick to Egypt in September. He remained there until he rejoined his unit on the Western Front in June 1916. In August, he fought in the Battle of Mouquet Farm. In 1917, Inwood was with his battalion when it fought in the Battle of Lagnicourt in April, then the Second Battle of Bullecourt the following month. During the Battle of Menin Road in September, he was involved in the elimination of a German machine-gun post and other actions, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He reached the rank of sergeant before being sent back to Australia in August 1918. During World War II, he volunteered for service in the Citizens Military Forces, and reached the rank of warrant officer class one, serving in the Australian Provost Corps and Military Prison and Detention Barracks Service. After the war he returned to work with the City of Adelaide, and upon his death he was buried with full military honours in the AIF Cemetery, West Terrace. His medals are displayed in the Adelaide Town Hall. Early life Born Reginald Roy Inwood on 14 July 1890 at North Adelaide, South Australia, he was the eldest son of Edward Inwood and his wife Mary Anne Minney. He had an older sister and three younger brothers. Roy was educated first at the North Adelaide Public School, and after the family moved to Broken Hill, New South Wales, he attended the Broken Hill Model School. After completing his schooling, he found work in the local mining industry, where he was employed at the outbreak of World War I. World War I =Gallipoli campaign= On 24 August 1914, Inwood enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and joined the 10th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division. The 10th Battalion underwent its initial training at Morphettville, South Australia, before embarking on the troopship HMAT A11 at Outer Harbor on 20 October. At the time of embarkation, the full battalion strength was 1,023 men. Sailing via Fremantle and Colombo, Ceylon, the ship arrived at Alexandria, Egypt, on 6 December, and the troops disembarked. They then boarded trains for Cairo where they entered camp at Mena in the shadow of the Great Pyramid of Giza on the following day, along with the rest of the AIF. After Inwood arrived in Egypt, his brother Robert Minney Inwood enlisted and was also allotted to the 10th Battalion. While at Mena, Roy Inwood performed duties as a mounted policeman. They remained at Mena until 28 February 1915, when they entrained for Alexandria. They embarked on the British troopship HMT on 1 March, and a few days later arrived at the port of Mudros on the Greek island of Lemnos in the northeastern Aegean Sea, where they remained on board for the next seven weeks. The 3rd Brigade had been chosen as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April. The brigade embarked on the battleship and the destroyer , and after transferring to strings of rowing-boats initially towed by steam pinnaces, the battalion began rowing ashore about 4:30a.m. Inwood participated in the heavy fighting at the landing, and other than a short period in hospital in May, was involved in the subsequent trench warfare defending the beachhead, being promoted to lance corporal in August. In early May, Robert had joined the battalion on Gallipoli. In September Roy was evacuated sick to Egypt, initially with gastritis and then with rheumatism, and remained there recuperating while the 10th Battalion was withdrawn to Lemnos in November, and subsequently back to Egypt. =Western Front= 1916 The battalion underwent reorganisation and training in Egypt then sailed for France in March 1916 where it was committed to fighting on the Western Front in June. Inwood did not rejoin his battalion until 30 July, and was promoted to temporary corporal two weeks later in the wake of the 327 casualties suffered by the unit during its first major action on the Western Front, the Battle of Pozi√®res. Among those killed was Roy's brother, Robert, by then a sergeant. In mid-to-late August, the battalion was committed to the Battle of Mouquet Farm, during which it suffered another 335 casualties.

After being relieved in early October, the 10th Battalion was again withdrawn to camps in the rear, where they remained until early November. While in camp in October, Inwood was charged with absence without leave and reduced in rank to private. The battalion then returned to the front line near Gueudecourt, France, until 12 November, and was then withdrawn into rear areas until a stint in the support trenches at Flers in early December. On 10 December, Inwood was evacuated to hospital due to problems with his feet, and did not rejoin his unit until just after Christmas. 1917 Once Inwood returned to the battalion, it was involved in fatigue duties, then training, before moving back into the front line at Le Barque near Bazentin in mid-February 1917. On 25 February, the battalion was involved in an attack in the same sector, incurring about 20 per cent casualties. It was relieved on the same day, initially moving back into support trenches, before marching to the rear a few days later. Inwood and the rest of the battalion spent March 1917 in reserve and rest areas while Allied forces advanced towards the Hindenburg Line after the German withdrawal, before moving forward into the front line north of Louverval in early April. The unit was in a support role when the Germans counter-attacked during the Battle of Lagnicourt on 15 April; the battalion suffered only 11 casualties. Relieved soon after, the unit went into rear areas where it performed fatigue duties and salvage until 5 May when it entered the line near Bullecourt. Over the following three days, Inwood and the rest of the battalion were involved in the Second Battle of Bullecourt, during which the unit suffered 182 casualties. From mid-May until mid-September, the 10th Battalion was out of the line in rest areas, undergoing training and engaging in sports. alt=a bronze Cross patt√©e suspended from a crimson ribbon The battalion went into action at Polygon Wood on 19 September during the Battle of Menin Road. Attacking the second objective along the west edge of Polygon Wood with the rest of his unit, Inwood moved forward of the friendly artillery barrage and single-handedly captured a German post, killing several enemy and taking nine prisoners. He then volunteered for a night patrol, during which he went forward and sent back information about enemy dispositions. The fighting continued over the next few days, and on 21 September, while the battalion was consolidating, Inwood located a German machine-gun post. He went forward and killed all the Germans in the post except one, who he forced to carry the machine gun back to the Australian lines. In this latter action, Inwood was assisted, albeit apparently briefly, by an unidentified soldier from 7th Battalion. Inwood was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions. The VC was the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. The 10th Battalion suffered 207 casualties during the Battle of Menin Road. Inwood was again promoted to lance corporal on 28 September, after which he went on leave to the United Kingdom. On his return, he was promoted to corporal, and then spent several weeks at the 3rd Brigade training school. The 10th Battalion rotated through support, reserve and rest areas throughout November 1917. Inwood's VC citation was published on 23 November 1917, and read: alt=a black and white photograph of a group of men in uniform on a ship Inwood had another two weeks' leave in the United Kingdom immediately prior to Christmas 1917, during which he was invested with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 12 December. 1918 The 10th Battalion continued to rotate through front line, support, reserve and rest areas until mid-April 1918 when it travelled north by train, and was involved in an attack at M√©teren on 24‚Äì25 April, during which it suffered 79 casualties. This was the last fighting that Inwood experienced, as he was sent to the United Kingdom on 29 April, where he was involved in training for several months. He was repatriated to Australia along with nine other VC recipients in August 1918, to take part in a recruiting campaign on the invitation of Prime Minister Billy Hughes. He disembarked from the troopship HMAT A7 in Adelaide on 11 October, and was discharged on 12 December, the war having ended on 11 November. Inwood rose to the rank of sergeant by the end of his service. As well as the Victoria Cross, he received the 1914‚Äì15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I. As well as Robert, his other younger brother also served; Private Harold Ray Inwood served with the 43rd Battalion and returned to Australia in 1917 after being wounded. Interwar period Inwood returned to a hero's welcome in Broken Hill in October 1918 but at an event organised in his honour gave a controversial public speech. He claimed he had \\"been stoned by mongrels at the train\\", when he had departed to fight and with his return \\"those mongrels were the first to shake me by the hand\\". Newly enlisted soldiers had been hooted and jeered at by militant socialists in Broken Hill on their departure, but there is no evidence stones were thrown. Inwood went on to assert that, \\"If the boys stick together like they did in France there will be no Bolshevikism in this town... I would like to be at one end of the street with a machine-gun and have them at the other end\\". The far-left Australian Labor Party Member for Barrier in the Australian House of Representatives, Michael Considine, accused Inwood of trying \\"to incite trouble between returned soldiers and the working classes\\". Inwood subsequently apologised for his comments. No longer welcome in Broken Hill due to his comments, Inwood moved to Adelaide where he married a 23-year-old widow, Mabel Alice Collins, n√©e Weber, on 31 December 1918. Inwood had difficulty in finding work, and he and Mabel divorced in 1921. He then moved to Queenstown, Tasmania, to work in the mines, and then back to Kangaroo Island in South Australia, where he worked in a eucalyptus distillery. Inwood married Evelyn Owens in 1927. Returning to Adelaide, he was employed by the Adelaide City Council as a labourer from 1928 onwards. By 1937, Evelyn had died. World War II Less than a month after the outbreak of World War II, Inwood volunteered for service in the Citizens Military Forces and again enlisted as a private, although he was promoted to sergeant within a week. In March 1940 he was transferred to the 4th Military District (4 MD) Australian Provost Corps (military police) section, and was promoted to staff sergeant. He was then transferred to the 4 MD detention barracks staff in November. He went on leave for three weeks in January‚ÄìFebruary 1941, and was transferred back to the provost section, later provost company, in November, and two weeks later was promoted to warrant officer class two. In April 1942, he was temporarily promoted to warrant officer class one, before being transferred back to a detention barracks in August. Inwood married Louise Elizabeth Gates in 1942, and this was a happy marriage. In June 1943, Inwood was transferred from the Australian Provost Corps to the Military Prison and Detention Barracks Service, and was then posted around various detention barracks, being substantively promoted to warrant officer class one in November 1943. Aged 54, he was medically discharged on 30 November 1944 due to a deterioration in his overall health. For his service in World War II, Inwood received the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939‚Äì1945. He was also later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. Post-war Inwood returned to the Adelaide City Council where he continued working until 1955. He attended the VC centenary celebrations in London the following year. For many years he lived at Norwood, and he died on 23 October 1971 at St Peters. He was given a military funeral and buried at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide. Despite his three marriages, he had no children. Inwood maintained strong links with his 10th Battalion comrades over the years, and always marched alongside them in the Adelaide Anzac Day Commemorative March. According to his Australian Dictionary of Biography entry, Inwood was \\"rugged, independent and well-built\\", but gave the impression that his VC \\"had not done him much good\\". Memorial controversies Inwood's grave at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery In his will, Inwood bequeathed all his war medals to the 10th Battalion Club, who indicated they would donate the VC to the Australian War Memorial. Inwood objected and stated he wanted the medal to remain in Adelaide. In June 1971, with Inwood's consent, the 10th Battalion Club decided to present the VC to the city upon his death. On 25 September 1972, his medals were handed over. They were displayed in the Adelaide Town Hall from 1972 until 1989, when it was decided to place them in a high security vault while a replica medal set was put on display. In 2005 Inwood's VC became the centre of considerable media and community debate with calls for it to be displayed in the Australian War Memorial's Hall of Valour. After consulting with the Inwood family and other interested parties, it was decided to honour Inwood's dying wishes. In December 2005, funds were allocated to provide security so the original VC could be displayed in the Adelaide Town Hall. In 2007 the debate regarding the sensitive subject briefly reignited. The 10th Battalion Other Ranks' Mess at the Torrens Parade Ground, Adelaide, was called the Roy Inwood VC Club. In 2008, it was debated whether to call the new tunnel under Anzac Highway either the \\"Inwood Underpass\\" or \\"Blackburn Underpass\\", after fellow South Australian and 10th Battalion soldier Arthur Blackburn, who was awarded the VC during the Battle of Pozi√®res while fighting alongside Inwood's brother Robert, before Robert was killed. The Returned and Services League of Australia objected that naming the tunnel after a specific veteran was inappropriate, saying it should be named after a major World War I battleground, in line with the highway's theme. On completion, the tunnel was named the Gallipoli Underpass.

The full citation was in the first set of awards of the VC published in the London Gazette on 24 February 1857, and read: Private Mathew Hughes, 7th Royal Fusiliers, was noticed by Colonel Campbell, 90th Light Infantry, on the 7th June, 1855, at the storming of the Quarries, for twice going for ammunition, under a heavy fire, across the open ground; he also went to the front, and brought in Private John Hampton, who was lying severely wounded; and on the 18th June, 1855, he volunteered to bring in Lieutenant Hobson, 7th Royal Fusiliers, who was lying severely wounded, and, in the act of doing so, was severely wounded himself. Hughes achieved the rank of sergeant that same year, but was later demoted. The Medal His Victoria Cross is on display at the Tower of London in the Royal Fusiliers Museum.

When heat is applied, it shrinks tightly over whatever it is covering. Heat can be applied with a handheld heat gun (electric or gas), or the product and film can pass through a heat tunnel on a conveyor. Composition The most commonly used shrink wrap is polyolefin. It is available in a variety of thicknesses, clarities, strengths and shrink ratios. The two primary films can be either crosslinked, or non crosslinked. Other shrink films include PVC, Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and several other compositions. Coextrusions and laminations are available for specific mechanical and barrier properties for shrink wrapping food. For example, five layers might be configuration as EP/EVA/copolyester/EVA/EP, where EP is ethylene-propylene and EVA is ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. PVC is the most used shrink wrap, due to its light weight, and inexpensive capabilities. PVC is durable, and can be used for many different purposes. However, it should be used in a well-ventilated area, as it can give off a strong, harmful odor. PVC has been banned in many countries, due to the harmful products created by its decomposition. PVC has some negative qualities including, it is not good for bundling, leaves carbon deposits, and has a low shrink force. Polyolefin or POF shrink wrap is a premium shrink wrap, as it's extremely durable and versatile. POF is puncture resistant, and has a strong seal strength, which allows it to be used for irregularly shaped items. POF is available in 35, 45, 60, 75, and 100, 1 mil gauges. POF shrink wrap is made from 100% recyclable materials, and is FDA approved. It has great clarity, and a glossy self-appearance, as appearance is critical. POF is great for bundling multiple items together, and has the ability to shrink completely and quickly. PE, a polyolefin, is used in several forms of flexible protective packaging. There are 3 different forms PE can take place in. These include Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE), and High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE). For shrink wrapping LDPE would be the best choice, as it has a higher strength, and more durability for heavier items. These wraps can also have graphic images printed on them, and LDPE provides the greatest quality. PE gauges can go all the way up to 1200, allowing for a great range of gauges. The disadvantage for PE is that it does not have a great shrink rate, and has lower clarity than other wraps. Manufacture A machine designed to continuously wrap up to 35 packets per minute A shrink film can be made to shrink in one direction (unidirectional or mono-directional) or in both directions (bidirectional). Films are stretched when they are warm to orient the molecules from their initial random pattern. Cooling the film sets the film's characteristics until it is reheated: this causes it to shrink back toward its initial dimensions. Prior to orientation, the molecules of a sheet or tube are randomly intertwined like a bowl of spaghetti. The molecules are coiled and twisted and have no particular alignment. However, when a draw force is imposed, the amorphous regions of the chains are straightened and aligned to the direction of orientation. By applying proper cooling, the molecules will be frozen in this state until sufficient heat energy is applied to allow the chains to shrink back. One can visualize this phenomenon by stretching a rubber band and dipping it into liquid nitrogen so as to freeze in the stretched state. The band will remain in this state as long as it is kept at sufficiently cold temperatures. However, when enough heat energy is applied, the rubber band will shrink back to its original relaxed state. Orientation on a commercial scale can be achieved using either of two processes: a tenterframe or a bubble process. Tenterframe technology is used to produce a variety of ‚Äúheat-set‚Äù products, with biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) being the most common (heat-setting is a process whereby a film is reheated in a constrained state such that the shrink properties are destroyed). The second commercial process is the bubble process, sometimes referred to as the tubular process. In this process, a primary tube is produced by either blowing or casting the tube onto an external or internal mandrel, respectively. It is common to use water to help cool the primary tube at this point. After the primary tube has been cooled, it is then reheated and inflated into a second bubble using air much like a balloon is blown. Upon inflation, the tube is oriented in both directions simultaneously. The family of shrink films has broadened over the years with many multi-layer constructions being sold today. Shrink film attributes include shrink, sealability, optics, toughness, and slip. With regard to shrink properties, there are onset temperature, free shrink, shrink force, shrink temperature range, memory, and overall package appearance. Use Shrink wrapped helicopters for transport Shrink film wrap being applied on a soft drink packing line Shrink wrapped pack of bottles with ends (bulls eyes) as handles Shrink wrap is applied over or around the intended item, often by automated equipment. It is then heated by a heat gun or sent through a shrink tunnel or oven for shrinking. Shrink wrap can be supplied in several forms. Flat rollstock can be wrapped around a product, often with heat sealing to tack the film together. Centerfolded film is supplied on a roll with the plastic pre- folded in half, product is placed in the center portion, the remaining three edges are sealed to form a bag, and the package then heated which causes the bag to shrink and conform to the product. Pre-formed plastic shrink bags have one end open, the product is placed in the bag, sealed, and sent for heat shrinking. Shrink wrap can be used to wrap buildings. It can wrap roofs after hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and other disasters. Shrink wrap can be used for environmental containments to facilitate safe removal of asbestos, lead and other hazards. Shrink wrap is sometimes used to wrap up books, especially adult-oriented ones and premium comics and manga, mainly to preserve their mint condition, as casual previewing prior to purchase wears or damages stock, rendering it unsaleable. Vegetables such as cucumbers can be individually shrink wrapped to extend the shelf life.  PMID =23904659 Software on carriers such as CDs or DVDs are often sold in boxes that are packaged in shrink wrap. The licenses of such software are typically put inside the boxes, making it impossible to read them before purchasing. This has raised questions about the validity of such shrink wrap licenses. Shrink wrap is commonly used as an overwrap on many types of packaging, including cartons, boxes, beverage cans and pallet loads. Foam cushioning can be held securely in shrink film, eliminating use of a traditional corrugated box. A variety of products may be enclosed in shrink wrap to stabilize the products, unitize them, keep them clean, or add tamper resistance. It can be the primary covering for some foods such as cheese, meats, vegetables and plants. Heat- shrink tubing is used to seal electric wiring. Shrink bands are applied over parts of packages for tamper resistance or labels. It can be used as a Tamper- evident band. It can also combine two packages or parts into a Multi-pack. Shrink wrap is also commonly used within more industrial applications using a heavier weight shrink film. The principles remain the same with a heat shrinking process using a hand held heat gun. The following shrink wrap applications are becoming more widely used and accepted: *Industrial shrink wrap containment of large plant equipment/components, *Scaffold wrap containment of buildings/bridges, *Building temporary shrink wrap structures for storage or other business operational uses, *Marine shrink wrapping of boats and other vehicles, *Shrink wrapping of palletized freight *Disaster contingency and relief projects such as damaged buildings/roofs.

They are generally regarded as being aimed at a slightly older audience than many of his other children's books. The stories were written at varying times throughout his life. Two of the stories are autobiographical in nature; one describes how he first became a writer while the other describes some of Dahl's experiences as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. Another piece in the collection is a non-fiction account of a British farmer finding a legendary haul of ancient Roman treasure. The book was first published in London in 1977 by Jonathan Cape. Chapters =The Boy Who Talked with Animals= This is a first-person fiction piece of medium- length writing. The narrator, on advice from friends, decides to vacation in Jamaica. One night, a sea turtle, ancient and huge, is caught by a group of fishermen. Rich people want to buy it, while the manager of a nearby hotel wants to make turtle soup and eat him but both plans are foiled when a little boy and his parents appear, and the child screams at the people, calling them \\"horrible and cruel\\". His parents reveal that the boy loves animals deeply, and even talks to them. His father pays off the fisherfolk and hotel manager, and the turtle is set free. The next day, the boy is missing, and the fisherfolk reveal that they have seen the child riding on the back of the sea turtle into the distance. =The Hitch-Hiker= This is another fictional first person narrative. The narrator in this case has a brand new BMW 3.3 Li, and is enjoying a trip down the highway when he spots a hitchhiker. He lets the man into his car; the passenger is described as being curiously rat-like, with long, white fingers. They engage in conversation, revealing the man's Cockney accent and attitudes. As they talk, the narrator is urged by the hitchhiker to test the car's engine power by going ever faster. This results in a police motorbike pulling them over for speeding. The police officer who writes the ticket acts particularly cruel, threatening the narrator with a long prison sentence and a huge fine. The narrator is despondent until his new friend challenges the narrator to guess his true profession. As he does, the hitchhiker suddenly reveals various items from the narrator's person, from a wallet to a watch to the narrator's shoelace. The narrator accuses the hitchhiker of being a pickpocket. The hitchhiker disagrees, claiming that he is a \\"fingersmith\\" ‚Äì just as a goldsmith has mastered gold, he has mastered the use of his fingers. He claims that he is never caught due to his \\"fantastic fingers\\". He then reveals that he has stolen both the police officer's notebooks, which contain the tickets and details against them. Relieved, the narrator and the hitchhiker then stop on the highway to light a bonfire of the notebooks. =The Mildenhall Treasure= This is a non-fiction account of a labourer named Gordon Butcher who uncovered a large quantity of Roman treasure, the Mildenhall Treasure, in a field that he was ploughing for a farmer when he found pure silver and another man tried to deceive him into thinking it was worth nothing. It was first published in the Saturday Evening Post magazine in the US in 1946Dahl, Roald (1947). \\"The Mildenhall Treasure\\" in Saturday Evening Post (20 September): 20‚Äì21, 93‚Äì4, 96‚Äì7, 99. and was first published in book form in this collection. It was published as a single title edition in 1999 by Jonathan Cape, with a newly commissioned cover illustration by Ralph Steadman. =The Swan= \\"The Swan\\" is a short story about the boys Ernie and his friend Raymond, who like to bully Peter Watson. When Ernie receives a rifle for his fifteenth birthday, they both shoot birds on their way to the rabbit field. As a joke, they menace Peter with the rifle, and tie him to the railway tracks; but Peter survives the train by sinking into the ballast. At first in hope of throwing Peter, still tied, into a lake, Ernie shoots a duck instead, and sends Peter to obtain it. Later, Ernie shoots a swan against Peter's wishes, and Peter wishes that the swan could come back to life. Ernie, in answer, cuts off both of the swan's wings, ties the wings to Peter's arms, and says: ‚ÄúLook, I have brought the swan back to life!‚Äù; then forces Peter to leap from a tree. When shot in one leg, Peter falls off the branch, but grabs onto another; sees a bright light; and jumps off the branch, which creates the image of an enormous swan flying over the village. Peter then falls into his mother's garden, where Mrs. Watson finds him, calls a doctor and an ambulance, and cuts the wings from his arms. =The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar= Henry Sugar, an independently wealthy man who enjoys gambling, finds and reads a doctor's report on a strange patient the doctor met while stationed at a hospital in India. This patient, who called himself \\"The Man Who Sees Without Using His Eyes\\", had the ability to see even after the doctors had medically sealed the man's eyes shut and bandaged his head. The man was part of a circus act and used his ability to make money. When interviewed in more detail by the curious doctors he gave an account which they wrote up. The man claimed he had been interested in magic all his life, and managed to study with Yogi Hardawar in India, by which he develops the ability to see through thin objects such a paper or playing cards, and can see around solid objects such as a wooden door if he is allowed a finger or hand around it. The doctors decide the man could be of great benefit as a teacher of the blind, and return to the circus, only to find the show canceled, when the Man Who Sees Without Using His Eyes has died. Henry realizes that the book contains a detailed description of the meditation method used to gain this ability; he steals the book and then decides to try to master the art described. After only three years, Henry masters the ability to see through playing cards, and can even predict the future. Henry uses these abilities in a casino, where he becomes cognisant of other gamblers' greed. He uses his powers to predict which number will win on a roulette wheel, then later makes a great deal of money at the blackjack tables, and refrains from more feats in fear of publicity. Henry wins enough money to buy a small house or a large automobile but realizes that the thrill of winning or losing has been eradicated by his ease. Afraid that his misuse of clairvoyance will kill him, Henry worries for a night; but survives into the morning, and throws the money off his balcony. Soon, a near-riot breaks out as the people of London rush to collect the twenty pound notes falling from Henry's apartment. A police officer scolds Henry and suggests that he find a more legal form of charity; whereupon Henry vows to establish the most well-equipped and supportive orphanages on the planet. This plan works well until he reaches Las Vegas, where he unknowingly collects a huge sum from three casinos owned by the same Mafioso, and narrowly escapes the owner's thugs. Thereafter Henry flies to Hollywood, where he enlists the aid of a famous makeup artist to create various disguises and false identities to protect himself. This works successfully, and with the aid of his accountant and the artist he successfully travels the world under a number of names and identities. At the end of the story, the author reveals that he was selected, seemingly at random, by Henry's accountant to write Henry's story, as the man has died. The narrator is shocked to hear all of the events, and also comments that Henry's wish came true-the Henry Sugar Orphanages, established all across the globe, are indeed the best in the world. The story is considered to be mildly satiric of Dahl's critics, who would sometimes nickname him the \\"Master of Nastiness\\". Here, he gives a happy ending, and even gives a sweet and rather anodyne name to the protagonist. =Lucky Break= This is a non-fictional account, similar to Roald Dahl's Boy and Going Solo albeit in a more concise form. It discusses the events in his life that led him to become a writer, including a meeting with a famous writer, who helped to launch his career. The story is about Dahl's school and all the teachers, until after the publication of his first story. =A Piece of Cake= This is an autobiographical account of Dahl's time as a fighter pilot in the Second World War, particularly the details of how Dahl was injured and eventually forced to leave the Mediterranean arena. The original version of the story was written for C. S. Forester so that he could get the gist of Dahl's story and rewrite it in his own words. Forester was so impressed by the story (Dahl at the time did not believe himself a capable writer) that he sent it without modification to his agent, who had it published (as \\"Shot Down Over Libya\\") in the Saturday Evening Post, thereby to initiate Dahl's writing career. This short story was also published in one of Dahl's many collections of short stories Over to You which was first published in 1946.

Details One of seven sons of a Sheffield gardener, Arnold Loosemore enlisted in the Army on 2 January 1915 aged 18 years and 7 months. Posted to the York and Lancaster Regiment, in July 1915 he left Liverpool for the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign arriving in Suvla Bay in August 1915. Surviving this campaign and returning home, he was then trained to use the Lewis machine gun. After this training, in July 1916 he was sent to the Somme in France to join the 8th Battalion of the Duke of Wellington‚Äôs (West Riding) Regiment. In 1917 then aged 21 and a private, he was awarded the Victoria Cross and a year later the Distinguished Conduct Medal. =Victoria Cross (VC)= On 11 August 1917 south of Langemarck, Belgium, during the attack on a strongly held enemy position and his platoon having been held up by heavy machine-gun fire, Private Loosemore crawled through partially cut wire, dragging his Lewis machine-gun with him and single-handed dealt with a strong party of the enemy, killing about 20 of them. Immediately afterwards his Lewis gun was destroyed and three of the enemy rushed at him, but he shot them with his revolver. Later he shot several enemy snipers, and on returning to the original post he brought back a wounded comrade under heavy fire. =Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM)= On 19 June 1918 at Zillebeke, Belgium when out with a fighting patrol he displayed conspicuous gallantry and powers of leadership when his officer was wounded and the platoon scattered by hostile bombs. He rallied the men and brought them back in order with all the wounded to our lines. On a subsequent occasion he handled his platoon with great skill and a complete disregard of his own danger under heavy machine gun fire. It was owing to his determination and powers of leadership that the platoon eventually captured the enemy post which they were attacking. Later life In August 1917 he was promoted to corporal by his commanding officer for gallantry in the field and in May 1918 was promoted to the rank of sergeant. On 13 October 1918 he was badly wounded by machine gun fire near Villiers-en-Cauchies in France and eventually had his left leg amputated above the knee. His health undermined by war wounds and unable to work, he died on 10 April 1924 from tuberculosis leaving a wife and small son. His wife Amy was refused a War Widows pension from the Government because he died after the war and she knew he was ill when she married him. Almost destitute; his wife had to have him buried in an existing grave with three others in order to save money. Legacy His Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medals were sold in 1969 and are now privately owned and not on public display. In the early 1980s a street in the S12 area of Sheffield was named Loosemore Drive by the Lord Mayor. Soon afterwards a memorial plaque to mark this event was removed due to repeated vandalism.

Early life Charles Edward Hudson was born in Derby on 29 May 1892, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Edward Hudson of the Sherwood Foresters.Smart, p. 162 He was educated at a preparatory school in East Grinstead, Surrey, and later at Sherborne School, Dorset, which he attended (The Green) from September 1905 to July 1910. Charles did not stand out during his time at Sherborne School. He later recounted, in his journal published in the biography by his son, Miles Hudson, Two Lives 1892‚Äì1992, that being morbidly afraid of physical pain he was \\"terribly conscious of being a coward on the football field\\" and that it was not until he had been at Sherborne for some years that he was able to overcome these physical fears.Two Lives 1892‚Äì1992.

Instead he went to Ceylon and from 1912 to 1914 worked as an apprentice tea planter, also engaged in the first experimental rubber planting on the island.Hudson, pps. 25-26 There, he served part-time in the Ceylon Mounted Rifles, in an independent section formed of six young Europeans in the district he was working.Hudson, p. 27 First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Hudson returned to England and was granted a commission as a temporary second lieutenant in his father's regiment, the Sherwood Foresters, on 17 November 1914. He was made a temporary lieutenant on 8 February 1915, and a temporary captain on 11 October 1915, acting major on 21 November 1916, permanent captain in the Regular Army on 13 May 1917 and temporary lieutenant-colonel on 8 March 1918, ending the war as an acting lieutenant-colonel, having been promoted on 29 September. He was posted to the newly raised 11th (Service) Battalion, a Kitchener's Army unit, with whom he served in France and Belgium, most notably during the Battle of the Somme, and Italy from 1917, ending the war with the rank of temporary lieutenant-colonel, having been promoted to that rank on 23 November 1917, shortly after becoming Commanding Officer (CO) of his battalion, aged just 25. The battalion formed part of the 70th Brigade of the 23rd Division. During the conflict he received numerous military honours: in 1916 he was awarded the Military Cross (MC), in 1917 the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Bar, and in 1918 the Victoria Cross (VC). He was also mentioned in despatches five times, on 15 June 1916, 30 May 1916, 21 December 1917, 6 January 1919, 9 July 1919 and 3 February 1920,Hudson, p. 232 and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO on 23 November 1917. At the age of just 26, Hudson was one of the youngest Old Shirburnians to be awarded the VC.

The citation appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette on 11 July 1918. Between the wars After the war, Hudson, against advice and having embarked with a US Navy ship, volunteered to serve in the North Russia Intervention during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, where he was deployed as a brigade staff officer under the command of Brigadier-General Edmund Ironside at Archangel.Hudson, pps. 122-147 Returning to England, in 1920 Hudson married Gladys Lee, from Glendale, Northumberland, who he had first met in London after having been wounded in Italy in 1918. They had two sons, John Patrick Charles, born on 11 April 1922, and Miles Matthew Lee, born on 17 August 1925.Hudson, pps. 151‚àí152 Their first years of marriage, spent in Derby, were difficult, and Hudson, initially unwilling to do so, chose to remain in the army, although the pay was barely sufficient, and both he and his wife had to live on army rations.Hudson, pps. 150‚àí151 The first few years of Hudson's service as a Regular Army officer were spent mainly on regimental duties, initially as adjutant to his regiment's 3rd (Militia) Battalion, holding this post from 11 March 1920 until 10 March 1923. He attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1926 to 1927, where, among his fellow students included Harold Alexander, William Holden, Douglas Wimberley, Rob Lockhart, Richard Lewis, Roy Bucher, George Clark, Richard Bond, Eric Harrison, Sidney Archibald, George Wood, Reginald Nolder, Euan Miller, Brian Robertson and Noel Holmes, all of whom were to become general officers in the upcoming war. His instructors included men such as Wilfrid Lindsell, Bernard Paget, Ronald Adam, Alan Brooke and Bernard Montgomery, Robert Gordon-Finlayson, Henry Pownall and Harold Franklyn.Hudson, pps. 153‚àí154 Hudson's time there was not particularly distinguished, and by the end of his first year he was almost dropped from the course, for being either consistently lazy or lacking in interest. Hudson was critical of, and often rebelled against, the methods his instructors used, believing them to not differ significantly from the methods used by the senior commanders in the Great War, which often failed with a heavy cost in human life. He furthermore believed that the Staff College's training was inadequate if the army was to fight another major European war.Hudson, p. 155 His attitude was described by his instructors as awkward and often inclined to be pig-headed. Nevertheless, Hudson, for the most part, enjoyed his time there and he was recommended for future employment.Hudson, p. 154 Soon after graduating from the Staff College, Hudson returned to his regiment's 1st Battalion, then stationed in Northern Ireland, serving there for six months, before he transferred on 27 July 1928 to the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB), with the rank of major, after being told that there was little chance of promotion in his own regiment.Hudson, pps. 156‚àí157 After serving with Malaya Command as a staff officer from 1930 to 1932, he was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1932. He became a Chief Instructor in the grade of General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst from 31 January 1933 until 31 January 1937. He then returned to the 2nd Battalion of his regiment, serving in the Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, before moving down to Portsmouth to become part of the 9th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Bernard Montgomery, who had been one of Hudson's Staff College instructors.Hudson, pps. 157‚àí158 Hudson was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 30 April 1938 and, on 2 June, to the temporary rank of brigadier (and full colonel on the same date) and took command of the 2nd Brigade. The brigade was one of three which formed part of the 1st Infantry Division, whose General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Harold Alexander, an old friend from Sandhurst and Camberley days. This move was initiated by Leslie Hore-Belisha, the new Secretary of State for War, who wanted to promote younger officers.Hudson, p. 158 Second World War Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Hudson led his brigade overseas to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The brigade, after several months of relative inactivity during the \\"Phoney War\\" period, saw action throughout May 1940, when the German Army launched its invasion of France, which resulted in the brigade, along with the rest of the BEF, being forced to retreat to Dunkirk, from where it was evacuated to England in late May/early June.Hudson, pps. 165‚àí176 For his services in France and Belgium Hudson was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 11 July. With the threat of a German invasion of the United Kingdom, Hudson's brigade, along with the rest of the division, now commanded by Major-General Kenneth Anderson after Alexander was promoted to command I Corps, commenced anti-invasion duties, including beach defence, until mid-December when Hudson received his first divisional command.Hudson, pps. 177‚àí182 Promoted to the acting rank of major-general on 14 December, Hudson became GOC of the 46th Infantry Division, a second-line Territorial Army (TA) formation, taking over from Major-General Desmond Anderson. Formed in October 1939 as a duplicate of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, the 46th Division comprised the 137th, 138th and 139th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting divisional troops. The division, minus its divisional troops, had fought in France with the BEF, sustaining extremely heavy casualties due to its poor level of training, and after being evacuated, was then serving in Scotland under Scottish Command, reorganising after its heavy losses. Soon after Hudson became GOC, in early January 1941 the 46th Division moved to Cambridgeshire, then Norfolk, where it came under the command of Lieutenant-General Edmund Osborne's II Corps, serving under Eastern Command and, like it had in Scotland, focused on reorganising and training to repel a German invasion, although then considered unlikely in winter.Hudson, p. 184 Hudson only held the command for just over five months, until May 1941, after a dispute with Osborne, his senior officer, which resulted in his demotion to the substantive rank of colonel, and he never again held a divisional command, nor regained his rank of major-general. Osborne, who, possibly envious of Hudson being the holder of a VC, interfered with Hudson's command, writing to his battalion and brigade commanders without Hudson knowing, organising exercises, and visiting the division without informing its GOC.Hudson, pps. 184-185 Hudson wrote an official letter of complaint. Osborne arrived, apologised and promised that he would no longer interfere, and went away on two weeks' leave. However, when he returned Hudson received an official report that he was, in his corps commander's opinion, unfit to command a division.Hudson, pps. 185-186 Hudson, following Osborne's own advice, appealed, unsuccessfully, and he lost command of the division.Hudson, p. 187 He was succeeded as GOC of the 46th Division by Major-General Douglas Wimberley, a fellow student at the Staff College in the mid-1920s, who was sympathetic to Hudson's plight. Hudson wrote that \\"There are few blows in life which are more shattering than wounded pride. I felt personally shamed and disgraced. I had worn the insignia of a general long enough to become known to relatives, friends and acquaintances as such, and now I had to tell them that I had dropped to a rank lower than that I held before the war\\". After his demotion, he briefly commanded the 159th Infantry Brigade, part of the TA 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, then serving in Northern Ireland, but was soon sent to command the 182nd Brigade, part of the 61st Infantry Division, another TA formation which was also serving as British Troops in Northern Ireland. The division returned to the mainland in February 1943, moving to Essex and took part in Exercise Spartan, and moved to Kent in May, and the division was initially selected to play a role in Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy, only to be reduced to the Lower Establishment soon after, becoming essentially a training formation with the intention of supplying replacements to overseas units. Handing over command of the 182nd Brigade to Brigadier John Nichols in late November, he became aide- de-camp to King George VI from 1944 until his retirement from the army in 1946. Postwar He was awarded the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Commander). He died on holiday in the Scilly Isles on 4 April 1959, aged 66.Hudson, p. 225 Hudson was buried at St Mary's Church, Denbury in South Devon. An obituary for Brigadier Charles Edward Hudson was published in the Old Shirburnian Society Annual Report in September 1959, reading: His medals are on display at Nottingham Castle.The family of Major-General Charles Hudson Writings Hudson wrote his memoirs in a 730-page journal later published by his son Miles in 1992. He also wrote many poems based on experiences as far back as childhood that were also unpublished in his lifetime, as were two radio plays (never produced), ten short stories and many reflections on secular subjects. His only work that was published in his lifetime was several chess problems that appeared in chess magazines.Hudson, p. 223 References Bibliography * *Miles Hudson, Soldier, Poet, Rebel: The Extraordinary Life of Charles Hudson VC (The History Press Ltd., 2007).

These are police forces that cover a police area (a particular region) and have an independent police authority. Current police forces have their grounding in the Police Act 1996 (in England and Wales), a combination of Police (Scotland) Act 1967 and Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (in Scotland) and the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (in Northern Ireland), which prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a chief constable, jurisdiction and responsibilities. * National law enforcement bodies, including the National Crime Agency and national police forces that have a specific, non-regional jurisdiction, such as the British Transport Police. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 refers to these as 'special police forces', not including the NCA which is not a police force. In addition, there are non-police law enforcement agencies, whose officers are not police officers, but still enforce laws, and other bodies with solely investigatory powers. * Miscellaneous police forces, mostly having their foundations in older legislation or common law. These are responsible for policing specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks. Before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, they were often referred to as 'special police forces'; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously-mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003, the British Transport Police was such a force. The majority of law enforcement in the United Kingdom is carried out by territorial police forces that police the general public and their activities. The other types of agencies are concerned with policing of more specific matters. Over the centuries there has been a wide variation in the number of police forces in the United Kingdom, with a large number now no longer in existence. Territorial police forces County police forces traditionally bore the name \\"constabulary\\" upon their formation (as a derivation of \\"constable\\"). The reorganisation of police forces over the years has seen this name dropped in favour of \\"police\\" as a name, as many have decided that the word \\"constabulary\\" is confusing for people more used to searching for the word \\"police\\". However, a number of police forces in the areas overseen by the United Kingdom retain the name \\"constabulary\\": * 12 territorial forces in England * 1 special police force - Civil Nuclear Constabulary * 1 territorial force in the crown dependencies * 1 parks police force (under the terms of the Parks Regulation Act 1872) =England and Wales= 225px Except in Greater London, each territorial police force covers one or more of the local government areas (counties) established in the 1974 local government reorganisations (although with subsequent modifications), in an area known in statute as a police area. These forces provide the majority of policing services to the public of England and Wales. These forces have been known historically as \\"Home Office police forces\\" due to the central government department, the Home Office, being responsible for and providing the majority of funding these police forces. Despite the implication of the term, all police forces are independent, with operational control resting solely with the chief officer of each force (the Chief Constable or with regard to the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police forces, their respective Commissioners); each force was overseen by a Police authority until these were replaced by Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012. The Police Act 1996 is the most recent piece of legislation, which outlines the areas of responsibility for the 43 territorial forces of England and Wales (found in Schedule 1 of the Act). Constable is the lowest rank in the police service, but all officers, whatever their rank are \\"constables\\" in terms of legal powers and jurisdiction. Police officers in territorial police forces in England and Wales derive their jurisdiction from Section 30 of the Police Act 1996. This section outlines that such officers have jurisdiction throughout England and Wales and also the adjacent United Kingdom waters. Special Constables, who are part-time, volunteer officers of these forces, used to have a more limited jurisdiction ‚Äì limited solely to their own force areas and adjacent forces. Since 1 April 2007, however Special Constables of England & Wales have full police powers throughout those two countries. This means that, in contrast to the majority of countries, all UK volunteer police officers now have exactly the same powers as their full-time colleagues. There are a number of situations in which the jurisdiction of a constable extends to one of the other countries, and constables of one jurisdiction do have reciprocal powers of arrest in each other's jurisdictions as a matter of course ‚Äì see the main article for details.

Areas for which legislative responsibility remains with the UK Government include national security, terrorism, firearms and drugs. The Police (Scotland) Act 1967, as amended, was the basis for the organisation and jurisdiction of the eight former territorial forces in Scotland that were formed in 1975. These forces covered one or more of the areas of the local government regions established in the 1975 local government reorganisation (and since abolished), with minor adjustments to align with the post-1996 council area borders. These forces provided the majority of police services to the public of Scotland, although Scottish police officers also have limited jurisdiction throughout the rest of the United Kingdom as required (See above comments under English and Welsh forces). In 2011, the Scottish Government announced that it planned to amalgamate the eight territorial forces in Scotland, along with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, into a single agency. The Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, an Act of the Scottish Parliament, codified this amalgamation and brought about the new Police Service of Scotland (to be known as \\"Police Scotland\\"). The new force was established on 1 April 2013. In 2017, plans were being debated in the Scottish Parliament to merge railway policing with Police Scotland. As of December 2019, police numbers in Scotland were: *Police officers: 17,259 *Special constables: 531 *Other staff: 6,168 Community Support Officers, commonly referred to as \\"Police Community Support Officers\\", were established by Section 38(2) of the Police Reform Act 2002, which applies only to England and Wales. There are therefore no Community Support Officers in Scotland. =Northern Ireland= 225px County and borough based police forces were not formed in Ireland as they were in Great Britain, with instead a single Royal Irish Constabulary covering most of Ireland (the exceptions being the Dublin Metropolitan Police, which was responsible for policing in Dublin, and the Belfast Town Police force, which was replaced by the RIC in the 1880s). The Royal Ulster Constabulary was formed in 1922 after the establishment of the Irish Free State, and served until the reforms of the police under the terms established initially by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 undertaken by the Patten Commission, which led to the renaming of the RUC in 2001. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 sets out the basis for the organisation and function of the police force in the province. Until 2010, police powers were not transferred to the devolved Northern Ireland Executive, unlike Scotland, instead remaining with the Northern Ireland Office. However, in January 2010 agreement was reached between the two largest parties in the Assembly, the DUP and Sinn F√©in, over a course that would see them assume responsibility for policing and justice from April.What will happen when policing and justice is devolved? ‚Äì BBC News, 05/02/10 As of April 2007 police numbers in Northern Ireland were: *Police officers: 7,216 *Full-time reserve police officers: 335 *Part-time police officers: 684 *Other staff: 2,265 Police in Northern Ireland do not employ Police Community Support Officers Special police forces The following three government agencies are defined in legislation as \\"special police forces\\". As these forces are responsible to specific areas of infrastructure, they do not answer to the Home Office, but instead to the government department responsible for the area they police. All three forces do voluntarily submit themselves to HMIC inspection: *Ministry of Defence Police ‚Äì A police force tasked with providing armed security, uniformed policing, and investigative services to Ministry of Defence installations throughout the United Kingdom. *Civil Nuclear Constabulary ‚Äì A police force responsible for providing law enforcement and security at or within 5 km of any relevant nuclear site and for nuclear materials in transit within the United Kingdom.CNPA/CNC Annual Review 2006‚Äì07 *British Transport Police (Great Britain) ‚Äì A police force responsible for providing law enforcement at certain railways and light-rail systems in Great Britain. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 gave the British Transport Police and Ministry of Defence Police a limited, conditional authority to act outside of their primary jurisdiction, if the situation requires urgent police action and the local force are not readily available, or if they believe that there is risk to life or limb, or where they are assisting the local force. National law enforcement =Bodies with police powers= These bodies operate in more than one county of the United Kingdom. The remit of some of the bodies is further limited to the areas that they police. ;Government agencies ;Investigative *National Crime Agency (NCA) ‚Äì An agency that leads UK-wide activities to combat high-level crime such as organised crime. In addition, the NCA acts as the UK point of contact for foreign law enforcement agencies. It replaced the Serious Organised Crime Agency in 2013. *Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) ‚Äì a Home Office investigative agency for labour exploitation, also working with other agencies on organised crime. GLAA officers have powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 akin to those of Police Constables.https://www.gla.gov.uk/media/3120/gla-powers-under- pace.pdf *Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs ‚Äì Since the creation of the UK Border Agency (now Border Force), in the early 21st Century, staff of HMRC no longer perform frontline duties at ports of entry. The remainder of the staff with law enforcement powers employed by HMRC consists of the Criminal Investigation Branch, who, as customs officers, continue to exercise the powers granted under the Customs Management Acts and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, including arrest. ;Uniformed *Border Force ‚Äì a law- enforcement command within the Home Office, responsible for frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports. Border Force officers are dual- warranted as immigration and customs officers. They have powers of arrest and detention under the Immigration Act 1971 and Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. Designated immigration officers have additional powers from the UK Borders Act 2007, allowing them to arrest a person suspected non- border offences ‚Äì as a police constable would. *Immigration Enforcement are the Home Office specialist criminal investigations directorate. *Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers/Water bailiffs have the powers of a constable under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. Officers/bailiffs protect fish and combat related crime (e.g. poaching). ;Bodies hosted by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) *National Wildlife Crime Unit ‚Äì A police unit run by the NPCC that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies across the United Kingdom. *National Counter Terrorism Security Office ‚Äì A police unit run by the NPCC, which advises the British government on its counter terrorism strategy. *National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service ‚Äì A police unit run by the NPCC, tasked with combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime. ;Bodies hosted by territorial police forces *National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit ‚Äì A police unit that is part of the Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Operations Directorate, tasked with coordinating police response to domestic extremism across the United Kingdom. *Protection Command ‚Äì A police unit that is part of the Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Operations Directorate, responsible for providing protective security to the government/diplomatic community and the Royal Family within the United Kingdom. *National Fraud Intelligence Bureau ‚Äì A police unit hosted by the City of London Police, tasked with combating economic crime throughout the United Kingdom. *National Ballistics Intelligence Service (Great Britain) ‚Äì A police unit hosted by West Midlands Police, tasked with gathering and disseminating fast time intelligence on the criminal use of firearms across Great Britain. *National Police Air Service (England and Wales) ‚Äì A police aviation service hosted by West Yorkshire Police, that provides centralised air support to the 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales. =Bodies with limited executive powers= These organisations are not police forces but do have similar powers to that of the police with the exception that they cannot arrest a person nor make forcible entry without a warrant. *Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (Great Britain) *Driver and Vehicle Agency (Northern Ireland) *The Independent Office for Police Conduct (England and Wales) investigates complaints against police officers and staff of the police forces in England and Wales, and staff of HM Revenue and Customs, the National Crime Agency in England and Wales, the Border Force and officers from the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. Certain investigators of the IOPC, for the purposes of the carrying out of an investigation and all purposes connected with it, have all the powers and privileges of constables throughout England and Wales and the territorial waters. =Bodies with solely investigatory powers= The use of investigatory powers is controlled by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Up to 792 public authorities have powers that are restricted by RIPA. *Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism *Security Service *Serious Fraud Office (England and Wales and Northern Ireland) Miscellaneous police forces These police forces generally come under the control of a local authority, public trusts or even private companies; examples include some ports police and the Mersey Tunnels Police. They could have been established by individual Acts of Parliament or under common law powers. Jurisdiction is generally limited to the relevant area of private property alone and in some cases (e.g. docks and harbours) the surrounding area. This, together with the small size of the police forces, means they are often reliant on the territorial force for the area under whose jurisdiction they fall to assist with any serious matter. The statutory responsibility for law and order sits with the territorial police forces even if there is a specialist police force in the locality. These police forces do not have independent Police Authorities and their founding statutes (if any) do not generally prescribe their structure and formation. =Ports police= There are two types of port police in the United Kingdom ‚Äî most are sworn in under the 1847 Act, but a few have Acts specific to their port. ;Ports police operating under the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847 For every port/harbour, an individual Act of Parliament (or, more recently, a Harbour (Revision) Order) can incorporate parts of the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847 (HDPCA) and apply them to that specific port/harbour. Officers of port police forces are sworn in as \\"special constables\\" under section 79 of the 1847 Act, as incorporated by the individual local Act. As a result, officers have the full powers of a constable on any land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land. The Marine Navigation Act 2013 has potentially enabled ports contables in England & Wales to act as constables beyond this one mile limit, in relation to policing purposes connected with the port only, in a police area where consent has been obtained from the relevant Chief Constable. This act does not however give general police powers to ports constables beyond their core jurisdiction as set out in the 1847 act, merely in relation to policing purposes connected to the port as set out in the Act. As of 2014, 3 ports police forces (Dover, Teesport and Bristol) have sought and received consent from the local Chief Constable, with a fourth (Liverpool) in the process of applying for it. This has enabled these 3 ports forces to act as constables, in relation to policing purposes connected to the port, throughout the police area in which they are geographically located. There are 224 constables sworn in under the 1847 Act. Serious or major incidents or crime generally become the responsibility of the local territorial police force. * Belfast Harbour Police ‚Äî Belfast Harbour, Belfast: HDPCA incorporated by section 5 of the Belfast Harbour Act 1847.section 5, Belfast Harbour Act 1847. * Larne Harbour Police ‚Äî Larne Harbour Ltd, Larne. * Port of Bristol Police ‚Äî Port of Bristol, Bristol. Includes Avonmouth Dock, Bristol, Royal Portbury Dock, North Somerset, and 3 islands in the Bristol Channel: Denny Island, Flat Holme, Steep Holme. * Port of Felixstowe Police ‚Äî Port of Felixstowe, Suffolk: HDPCA incorporated by section 3(1)(e) of the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Act 1956. *Port of Portland Police ‚Äî Portland Harbour, Isle of Portland: HDPCA incorporated by section 3 of the Portland Harbour Revision Order 1997. * Falmouth Docks Police ‚Äî Falmouth Docks, Falmouth, Cornwall: HDPCA incorporated by section 3 of the Falmouth Docks Act 1959.section 3(d), Falmouth Docks Act 1959. * Port of Dover Police ‚Äî Port of Dover, Dover: HDPCA incorporated by section 3 of the Dover Harbour Consolidation Act 1954, and incorporation amended by part 4 of the Dover Harbour Revision Order 2006. Given the large amount of property owned by the port, their jurisdiction effectively extends to all of Dover and now throughout Kent (in relation to port policing matters only) in order to be able to take arrested persons to Custody Suites. ;Other ports police * Port of Liverpool Police ‚Äî Port of Liverpool, Liverpool: current authority derives from article 3 of the Mersey Docks and Harbour (Police) Order 1975. Port of Liverpool police officers are Crown police officers and not special constables. * Port of Tilbury Police (formerly the Port of London Authority Police) ‚Äî Port of Tilbury, Essex: current authority derives from section 154 of the Port of London Act 1968 * Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Harbour Police ‚Äî Tees and Hartlepool: current authority derives from section 103 of the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Act 1966 * A large, new port on the Thames Estuary (and within the Port of London area) called \\"London Gateway\\", the owners have the authority to create their own police force for the port. The legislation also incorporates S.79 of the 1847 Act. =Parks police= Parks not controlled by local authorities These small constabularies are responsible for policing specific land and parks. Officers of these forces have the powers of a constable within their limited jurisdiction. They are not constables as dealt with in the general Police Acts. * Epping Forest Keepers *:Current powers derive from regulations made under Epping Forest Act 1878 * Kew Constabulary (formerly Royal Botanic Gardens Constabulary) *:Constables of this force have full police powers whilst on land belonging to the Royal Botanical Gardens as per the Parks Regulation Act 1872 as amended by section 3 (a) of the Parks Regulation (Amendment) Act 1974. The Parks Regulation Act 1872 provides for the attestation of parks constables. Parks controlled by local authorities A photograph of officers of the Birmingham Parks Police, taken between c. 1900 and 1910. Over history, a number of local authorities outside London have maintained their own parks police forces, the most notable being Liverpool (Liverpool Parks Police) and Birmingham (Birmingham Parks Police). No local authority parks police forces currently exist outside London, although the legal powers for them to do so (granted by various local Acts of Parliament) survive in a limited number of cases. In London, these constabularies are responsible for enforcing byelaws within the parks and open spaces of their respective local authorities. Members of the constabularies are sworn as constables under article 18 of the Greater London Parks and Open Spaces Order 1967. Members of the constabularies are constables only in relation to the enforcement of the parks byelaws (which, by definition, apply only in the parks). * Hammersmith and Fulham Parks Constabulary * Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Parks Police * Hampstead Heath Constabulary, also appointed under section 16 of the Corporation of London (Open Spaces) Act 1878 with the full powers and privileges of police constables. * Havering Parks Constabulary * Wandsworth Parks and Events Police Some of these constables have (or have had) a shared role as security staff for their own local authority's buildings and housing estates with appropriate changes of badges and/or uniform being made when changing to/from park duties. =Cathedral constables= See also Cathedral Constables' website Canterbury Cathedral Constable (Inspector) in beat uniform Cathedrals that have their own Constabularies consisting of attested constables that keep the peace at each Cathedral. * York Minster Police * Chester Cathedral Constables * Canterbury Cathedral Close Constables * Liverpool Cathedral Constables Salisbury Cathedral used to have its own constabulary, but this was disbanded in 2010. =Market police= Traditionally, markets would employ constables to look after markets. Most no longer exist, or exist in a form without attested constables (see below). * The City of London market constabularies are three small constabularies responsible for security at Billingsgate, New Spitalfields and Smithfield markets run by the City of London Corporation. However, unlike most other miscellaneous police organisations, the members are no longer attested as constables. * (defunct) Birmingham Market Police were a body of constables responsible for policing Birmingham's markets, but lost their constable powers in 1976. In 2016 Birmingham City Council introduced \\"market enforcement officers\\", who are \\"accredited persons\\" under the Community Safety Accreditation Scheme, giving them the power to issue fixed penalty notices for a variety of low-level offences. =Other= * Belfast International Airport Constabulary ‚Äì attested under article 19(3) of the Airports (Northern Ireland) Order 1994 as constables for the airport, which employs them. * Cambridge University Constabulary ‚Äì attested under the Universities Act 1825 as constables within the university precincts and up to four miles from them. * Mersey Tunnels Police ‚Äì attested under section 105 of the County of Merseyside Act 1980 as constables in and around the tunnels. Defence, military and service police Each branch of the military has its own police service, though the powers of a service police officer are identical and recipricol across all three services. The service police is made up of the: *Royal Navy Police *Royal Marines Police *Royal Military Police *Royal Air Force Police In the UK, the service police exercise jurisdiction over those serving in the military in any capacity and those civilians subject to service discipline as defined by the Armed Forces Act 2006. They are not 'constables' and do not have any policing powers in relation to the general public in normal circumstances. In British Forces Germany, under the Status Of Forces Act, military police have jurisdiction over British Forces personnel, their families, MOD contractors, and NAAFI staff. Service Police are PACE trained and all investigations are PACE compliant. They make regular use of civilian police facilities often conducting joint investigations where necessary. The Service Police are able to investigate all crime within their jurisdiction, up to and including Murder, however within the UK, offences of murder and sudden deaths are passed to the local police force as per national jurisdiction agreements. Whilst operating in conflict zones the military police will conduct the full range of policing including murder investigations as evidenced by the Sgt Blackman investigation. Other agencies exist to provide security to MOD and military bases in the UK and abroad. * Northern Ireland Security Guard Service (NISGS) ‚Äì Civilian Security Officers belonging to the Northern Ireland Security Guard Service are attested as Special Constables. * Germany Guard Service (GGS) - MOD uniformed civilian security officers providing armed security and access control to British Forces Germany units * Military Provost Guard Service (MPGS) - part of the Army Adjutant General's Corps, tasked with armed security at military establishments in mainland UK. * Ministry of Defence Guard Service (MGS) - civilian unarmed security officers providing security and access control at MOD and some military establishments. Bodies with limited enforcement powers There are also non-police (of any type) organisations who have been given certain powers to enforce rules, regulations and laws. #Under the community safety accreditation scheme (CSAS) and the similar railway safety accreditation scheme (RSAS), police forces in England and Wales have the power to grant limited powers to official persons (such as council wardens and private security staff), for example, the power to confiscate alcohol from under 18s. #Under the national railway byelaws, any 'authorised person' may ensure all persons on the railway are abiding by the byelaws. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/4202/railway- byelaws.pdf Generally, railway train operating companies (TOCs) leave this to dedicated enforcement officers. Sometimes these officers will have powers under the Railway safety accreditation scheme and as they are working for the railway, they also have powers under the railway byelaws.

The eponymous term is derived from the German inventor Baron Karl Drais, who invented his Laufmaschine (German for \\"running machine\\") in 1817, which was called Draisine in German (v√©locip√®de or draisienne in French) by the press. It is the first reliable claim for a practically used precursor to the bicycle, basically the first commercially successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine, nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse. Drais' dandy horse, called Draisine in German, whose name was inherited by the rail vehicle Later, the name draisine came to be applied only to the invention used on rails and was extended to similar vehicles, even when not human-powered. Because of their low weight and small size, they can be put on and taken off the rails at any place, allowing trains to pass. In the United States, motor- powered draisines are known as speeders while human-powered ones are referred as handcars. Vehicles that can be driven on both the highway and the rail line are called road‚Äìrail vehicles, or (after a trademark) Hy-Rails.  Dressin, velorail, trolley, or railbike  \\"Draisines\\", called dressin in Swedish, dresin in Norwegian, dr√¶sine in Danish, and resiina in Finnish, refers to pedal-powered rail-cycles which were used by railroad maintenance workers in Finland, Sweden, and Norway until about 1950, as handcars were elsewhere. Draisines nowadays are used for recreation on several unused railway lines in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Poland, some other European countries and South Korea.asiaenglish.visitkorea.or.kr Several companies rent draisines in Sweden. In the United States, railbike tours have operated in several states nationwide: Maine,bangordailynews.com Oregon,nwnewsnetwork.org the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York,lakeplacidnews.com and Delaware. Until 2007, Finland hosted an annual competition, Resiina-ralli (Draisine Rally), involving several draisine teams travelling for many days on the railways from one corner of the country to another.

They were light armoured rail motor vehicles, intended for reconnaissance, scouting, track patrolling, and other auxiliary combat tasks, usually belonging to armoured trains. Early vehicles of this kind were built in Russia during World War I. Later, often armoured cars were used as armoured draisines, after exchanging their wheels to railroad ones, or fitting them with additional retractable railroad rollers. Some countries, however, manufactured purpose-built armoured draisines between the wars, such as the USSR and Czechoslovakia. Peculiar vehicles were Polish armoured draisines - they were tanks or tankettes fitted with special rail chassis, able to be used on rails or on the ground, leaving the rail chassis on the rails. Some countries developed railtrack armoured draisines, with retractable tracks railroad wheels; they were not widely used, however. Different armoured draisines were used during the Second World War, starting from the invasion of Poland carried out by Nazi Germany. Prior to World War II, the Japanese Empire had already made extensive use of draisines such as the Sumida M.2593 in Manchuria and the Sino-Japanese war.  Construction  People have been putting bicycles on railroad tracks ever since there have been both bicycles and railroads. From time to time, factory-built models have been available, beginning with a device marketed in 1908 through the Sears catalogue for just US$5.45 (). There are many designs of draisine. However, certain fundamentals of railbike design must be adhered to, foremost among them the reconciliation of a bicycle's stability with adaptation to riding on a railway track: bicycles are kept upright by the rider steering in the direction of an impending fall, but this ability is sacrificed when the bicycle is constrained by rails. Simply adding flanged wheels to a conventional bicycle would make it impossible to balance, so the typical approach to stabilization is to add an outrigger, with roller(s), across to the second rail from near the bicycle‚Äôs rear wheel. Even such an outrigger system is not without its complications, as tracks that are no longer perfectly parallel ‚Äî common on sections of abandoned track ‚Äî can result in derailment. Additional guide rollers can help alleviate this problem at the expense of greater weight.

Early life Descended from the Maling pottery family, Maling was born at Carlton House in Bishopwearmouth, County Durham (now part of Sunderland), the youngest of nine children of Edwin Allan Maling (1838-1920), a general practitioner, and his wife Maria Jane, n√©e Hartley (1847-1932). His paternal grandmother was a first cousin of Sir Henry Havelock. His mother's family originated from Scotland and had established a glassmaking business in Sunderland in the 1830s. Maling was educated at Uppingham School and graduated with honours in natural sciences from Exeter College, Oxford. He continued his studies at St Thomas' Hospital, qualifying MB BCh in 1914, then MRCS and LRCP in 1915. After the initial outbreak of the First World War, Maling gained a temporary commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps as a 26-year-old Lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps on 18 January 1915. After five months he joined the 12th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) as their medical officer. The following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC: On 25 September 1915 near Fauquissart, France Lieutenant Maling worked for over 24 hours with untiring energy, collecting and treating in the open, under heavy shell fire, more than 300 men. During the morning of the 25th he was temporarily stunned by the bursting of a large high-explosive shell which wounded his only assistant and killed several of his patients. A second shell covered him and his instruments with debris, but he continued his gallant work single-handed. Maling was mentioned in despatches and promoted to Captain in 1916. He then returned to the UK and served in the Military Hospital in Grantham. He later joined the 34th Field Ambulance of the 11th (Northern) Division and served again in France for two years.

Biography Hilton was born in Middleton in Lancashire. He studied at Manchester Grammar School and arrived at Balliol College, Oxford in 1935. There he joined the student branch of the Communist Party. The influence of his tutors V. H. Galbraith and R. W. Southern drew him to medieval history. He acquired a first-class degree in modern history in 1938 and his DPhil in 1940, writing his dissertation on _The Economic Development of Some Leicestershire Estates in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries_. In 1939 he married fellow student and communist Margaret Palmer. Their only child, Tim, was born in 1941. He entered the army in 1940, serving as a regimental officer 46th battalion of the Royal Tank Regiment. During World War II he was posted at first in Italy, then in Egypt, Palestine and Lebanon. His communist allegiances had attracted the interest of British military intelligence and during his service, his superiours were tasked with monitoring and recording his movements. Returning to England, in 1946 Hilton co-founded the Communist Party Historians Group and was appointed to a lectureship at the University of Birmingham, where he remained until his retirement in 1982. Together with other CPHG members and non-Marxist historians, he founded the journal Past and Present in 1952. He continued to be monitored by police and MI5, who recorded his phone calls and opened his mail. Hilton was among many who resigned from the Communist Party in 1956 over the Soviet invasion of Hungary and became involved with the emerging British New Left. In 1963 he was made Professor of Medieval and Social History, and in 1973 joined the editorial board of the newly formed Journal of Peasant Studies.Byers, Terence J.

Early life  His father was chief of police at Kapurthala. Karamjeet was a member of the Indian National Congress Party. He regarded his brother Ajeet Singh Judge as a patriot for joining the Royal Indian Artillery. He seems to have been persuaded to join the army rather than continue political studies at Lahore College. Thus he enrolled for Officer Training School, Bangalore. He opted to join the Pioneer corps to get near the Burma front-line. At his brother's written request, he was accepted by 15th Punjab Regiment. =Army career= He was commissioned as an infantry subaltern at Ambala, before transfer to 39th Indian Division Nearing an important moment in the war, when the Allies were about to launch the largest counter-offensive of the war so far, he arrived with 4th Battalion into the British 14th Army to make the drive for Rangoon. General Slim's masterful strategy was simple: to divide the Japanese forces on a railway junction at Meiktila. The ensuing battles were among the most savage and bitter of the Second World War. The brilliant thrust captured the garrison town that controlled the crossing over the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese launched a series of counter-attacks to desperately try to keep the road to Mandalay open for their retreat. Myingyan became an important river-head supply base. 4/15th were part of Lt-Col Hubert Conroy's 33 Brigade whose job was to clear the forest in a triangle around Nyaunga bridgehead. South of Nyaunga they attacked Sindewa, a heavily defended Japanese position in the jungle, thick with trees. There were extensive minefields. On 18 March 1945 during the Battle of Meiktila in Burma (now Myanmar), he was ordered to capture a cotton mill. The assault began with an attack on the strategic river port of Myingan. By all accounts even before receiving the posthumous award, Singh was a brave soldier. Always eager to engage in actions he confided in C/O 4/15th Major Johnny Whitmarsh-Knight his desire for glory. They arrived on 17 March 1945. The following morning the Jat Company comprising Indian soldiers was to spearhead the assault. They were supported by the Sherman tanks of No 2 Troop, C Squadron, 116 Regiment (Gordon Highlanders), Royal Armoured Corps, commanded by Lt Hugh Baker. Singh was just 21 years old, and a Lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, in the British Indian Army during World War II when he performed the following deeds for which he was awarded the VC during the Battle of Myingan which raged over four days.

Although wounded in the head and leg he went forward alone with a Bren gun and tackled a troublesome enemy strong point, destroying it and killing all the occupants, but he was mortally wounded. The citation reads as follows: > \\"In BURMA, on the 16th February, 1944, Major Hoey's company formed part of a > force which was ordered to capture a position at all costs.

World Championship Tournament 2004, known in Japan as Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Expert 3 (ÈÅäÊàØÁéã„Éá„É•„Ç®„É´„É¢„É≥„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Ç∫ „Ç®„Ç≠„Çπ„Éë„Éº„Éà3), is a video game based on the Yu-Gi- Oh! franchise. This game has been released on the Game Boy Advance system.  Gameplay  This game has many obvious similarities to The Eternal Duelist Soul. The duel system is almost exactly the same, but there are a few differences. The player can assemble a deck and can duel against a variety of computer opponents. The game features the first 1,138 cards released in Japan. There are 29 opponents in the game, however duelist 29 can't be played and is locked when Marik is at least once defeated. Each opponent has different skills and decks revolve around a certain theme (Yugi=Basic, Exodia Rare Hunter=Exodia, Yami Yugi (Dark Yugi)=Ultimate, etc.).Konami (2004), Yugioh World Championship Tournament 2004 EU Instruction Booklet, page 7 = Game mechanics = When a duelist has at least one copy of all 1,138 cards, they can choose to ignore the Limited List. However, the stronger duelists don't follow the Limited list either. For example, Simon the Exodia duelist has three of each of the Exodia parts in his deck, where normally a player may only have one. The AI is rather poor: if a player has a face-down monster with 2000 defense points, and the AI opponent has a monster with 1900 attack points, they will not attack as they \\"know\\" they cannot defeat the face-down monster. As well, an AI opponent will Tribute Summon as soon as possible, even tributing 1 monster to summon exactly the same monster, or even a weaker monster than the original. Stronger duelists often have high requirements to be \\"unlocked\\" (available to duel): the final duelists in the game require the player have at least fifteen more wins than losses against every other duelist in the game. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Sequel Yu-Gi-Oh! 7 Trials to Glory: World Championship Tournament 2005, also known as Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters International 2 in Japan and Yu-Gi-Oh! Day of the Duelist: World Championship Tournament 2005 in Australia and Europe, was released for the Game Boy Advance. The game is initially a role-playing video game with strategy elements, in the form of the in-game dueling that plays the main role in this game. The player assumes the role of a beginner duelist who must enter card battle tournaments. The game also comes with three free Yu-Gi-Oh! game cards: Mind Control, Kaibaman, and Silent Swordsman LV7.

He played as a midfielder in the English Football League between 1977 and 1988, winning five league titles and an FA Cup (scoring in the 1986 final) with Liverpool. Nicknamed \\"skippy\\", Johnston was a crowd favourite at Anfield, making 271 Liverpool appearances and scoring 40 goals. He was a key member of the 1986 \\"double\\" winning team. He also co-wrote the team's 1988 cup final song \\"Anfield Rap\\". After retiring, he designed and created the prototype for Adidas' Predator football boot, worn by many footballers and rugby players. He was eligible for the Australian and South African national teams, but only ever appeared for the England U21 youth team. Childhood Johnston was born in Johannesburg, South Africa to Australian parents; he returned home to Australia with his family as a small child.Johnston, Jameson p.34 At the age of six, Johnston contracted osteomyelitis and came close to losing his leg and would have done if not for the expertise of an American specialist who was touring and lecturing in Australia at the time.Johnston, Jameson p.43 Encouraged by his father who had trialled at Preston North End and Dundee United,Johnston, Jameson p.30 Johnston took up football with Lake Macquarie City FC in Newcastle, New South Wales.Johnston, Jameson pp.45,47 At the age of 14 he wrote to four English clubs, among those Manchester United and Chelsea seeking a trial.Johnston, Jameson p.52 Middlesbrough, managed by Jack Charlton, replied and Johnston's parents sold their house to fund his ticket to England.Johnston, Jameson p.54 As a 15-year-old, Johnston stayed at Middlesbrough for six months, returning to Australia to play briefly for Sydney City, before moving back to Middlesbrough. His mother wanted him to be a teacher, whereas his father wanted him to be a footballer. Career in England Johnston made his first team debut for Middlesbrough, aged 17, in a FA Cup tie against Everton.Johnston, Jameson p.82 His league debut came on 4 February 1978 in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Birmingham City at St Andrews and he scored his first goal later that season in a 2‚Äì1 home league defeat to West Ham United. Johnston scored 16 goals in 64 games for Middlesbrough before moving to Liverpool in 1981 for ¬£650,000.Johnston, Jameson p.115 Johnston made his Liverpool debut in August 1981, coming on as sub for Ray Kennedy in the 1‚Äì0 league defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Johnston's first start came in the Intercontinental Cup fixture against Brazilian side Flamengo. Johnston scored his first goal for Liverpool on 8 December 1981 against Arsenal at Anfield, during a League Cup fourth round replay. Johnston opened the scoring in the fifth minute of extra time in a 3‚Äì0 win. Johnston, known as Skippy, was a crowd favourite at Anfield during his long spell with the club. He worked under three managers ‚Äì Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish ‚Äì and, when picked, predominantly played on the right side of midfield. He made a total of 271 appearances for the club and scored 40 goals. Johnston was part of the League championship-winning teams of 1982 and 1983 and gained a League Cup winner's medal in 1983. In 1984, Johnston was part of the team which won a treble of League championship, League Cup and European Cup. Two years later he was an integral part of the side which won only the third League championship and FA Cup \\"double\\" of the 20th century. In the 1986 FA Cup final at Wembley, Johnston scored Liverpool's second goal in a 3‚Äì1 win over Everton. In 1988, he was a frequent substitute and occasional starter as Liverpool again won the League title and reached the FA Cup final, aiming to complete a second \\"double\\". Johnston wrote the club's traditional Cup final song called \\"Anfield Rap\\" which combined pro-Liverpool lyrics with the rap and house trends of the time, with other Liverpool players contributing. His last two goals for the Reds came in the penultimate league game of the season, a 5‚Äì1 away win over Sheffield Wednesday. By this stage, Liverpool had wrapped up the 17th league title of their history. International career Johnston was approached by Jock Stein in the early 1980s with a view to him playing for Scotland as he was eligible through his father. Johnston declined Stein's offer and also resisted calls to play for his country Australia in 1981 and 1984.Johnston, Jameson p.97, 148 He instead chose to represent England at under-21 and 'B' team level. Early in his career in England he had described playing football for Australia as \\"like surfing for England.\\" Johnston was also eligible to represent the South African national side due to being born there but was never approached or offered by the South African federation to play for them. Johnston was called up to the full England squad in November 1987 but did not make an appearance at that level. Retirement After 271 appearances and 40 goals and just days before the 1988 FA Cup Final at Wembley against Wimbledon, Johnston incurred his manager's wrath when he announced his premature retirement from Liverpool. Kenny Dalglish was livid but later relented and gave his blessing to Johnston when he found out the reason for the player's decision. Earlier that year Johnston's sister became seriously ill and was admitted to a hospital in Morocco. By the end of the season, it was clear she needed round the clock attention back home in Australia and Johnston wished to provide that care. He came on for his 271st appearance as a substitute for John Aldridge in the final (who had just seen his penalty saved with Liverpool a goal down) but ended up on the losing side. He never wore a Liverpool shirt again. When the Hillsborough disaster occurred in 1989, a year after Johnston's departure, he raised funds in Australia and also flew back to England to attend funerals and memorial services. He later dedicated his autobiography, titled Walk Alone, to the victims of the Heysel and Hillsborough disasters. In 1991, when Graeme Souness was manager of Liverpool F.C., he asked Johnston if he would like to train with the team with a view to playing again. Liverpool F.C. still held Johnston's registration as a player. It didn't work out and Johnston moved on. However, Johnston possesses an undying love for Liverpool and its fans. After his retirement he was constantly being linked to clubs from all over. Johnston always retorted this speculation stating that he could never play for anyone other than Liverpool. Business career After retiring from playing football, Johnston found success as a businessman and innovator, designing and creating the prototype for Adidas' Predator football boot, worn by many of the world's top players of both football and rugby including Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Xavi, Jonny Wilkinson and Ronan O'Gara. He later designed another innovative boot called The Pig or, to give them their full title, the Patented Interactive Grip can come as a 'skin' that can be placed over the toe of an existing boot. Getting the first boot off the ground took Johnston 5 years and was initially refused by Adidas, as well as Nike and Reebok. However, Johnston had filmed Franz Beckenbauer using the boots in Germany in snowy conditions, and its increased grip led to Adidas agreeing to the proposal. Johnston also invented the Traxion sole for football boots and the software program the 'Butler,' a device that shows what has been removed from minibars in hotel bedrooms. Johnston is also the creator of a gameshow called 'The Main Event.' Johnston invested heavily in a football school idea for inner city children but failed to win expected business backing and went bankrupt. He was made temporarily homeless as a result.ESPNsoccernet ‚Äì Global ‚Äì Dasey: The other side of the lens Johnston has since forged a new career as a photographer. Johnston was very critical about modern football boot designs, stating they are to blame for the recent spate of metatarsal injuries. He believed that the studs on the soles of the boots do not release quickly enough, meaning that they get stuck in the ground putting extra pressure on the players' already stressed knees, ankles and metatarsals. He also thought that the problem can be solved by designing a smaller stud that doesn't stick to the soil. Other activities Though he travels the world with his business interests, Johnston remains based in Australia. He has been recognised at home for his achievements in England. On 18 June 2006, Johnston made an appearance as a guest on The Footy Show World Cup Spectacular in Germany revealing information on his career. During the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop compiled by the official Liverpool FC website, over 110,000 of the club's fans worldwide voted for their top 100 players of all time, with Johnston coming in a very respectable 59th. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Johnston wrote a 12-page letter to FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, in which he collected all criticism by players and coaches of the controversial Adidas-produced Jabulani ball, risking his reputation, and expecting to be blacklisted by the conservative governing body as a result of this letter.Craig Johnston critical of World Cup ball . 6 July 2010.

It has since been ported to a number of other platforms. The Commodore 64 version was released in the U.S. under the title Chop N' Drop. Gameplay In the game, three karateka fight against each other on a beach, trying to be the first to score six points. After every two rounds, there is a bonus game which is either deflecting bouncing balls or kicking away bombs. The C64 version of the game only has the ball bouncing bonus game, and not the bomb bonus game. The game can be played by one or two human players; at least one fighter is always controlled by the computer. Unlike its predecessor, International Karate, there is only one backdrop. However, different parts of the backdrop can be recoloured to several different themes by the players using specific keystrokes. The Amiga, Atari and C64 versions of the game (and possibly other versions, unconfirmed) had a number of \\"background antics\\", a Pac-Man would appear, a spider would descend, and a U-boat's periscope would occasionally be seen in the harbour. In addition, pressing a certain key or keys would cause the trousers of all three protagonists to fall down, after which they would do a double-take. Additionally, it was possible (on the Amiga version, at least) to type in four-letter curse words; the game would respond first by rebuking the player for their use of such language, and upon the second offence would reset the game. History Archer Maclean did most of the work on developing the game, and the music was written by Rob Hubbard, who created a more energetic main theme after the predecessor, but still based it on \\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\\" by japanese composer and actor Ryuichi Sakamoto. Music for the Amiga version was arranged by Dave Lowe. The game was voted Best 16-bit Soundtrack of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue092/Pages/CVG09200062.jpg In August 2005, the music from the game was performed at the third Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany. The game enjoyed a large following in Europe during the late 1980s and even into the early 1990s. In North America it was nowhere near as popular as in Europe, although it became somewhat of a cult game there as well. The packaging illustration for the Activision Commodore 64 release version of IK+, entitled \\"Chop 'N Drop\\", was created by Marc Ericksen. Ports and remakes 16-bit versions of the game were released in 1988 for the Atari ST and Amiga home computers. Except for the music, which was done by Dave Lowe, the Atari ST version was done entirely by Archer MacLean.Toni Schwaiger: \\"Archer MacLean.

Coding was done in assembler on a PC-based development system that cross-compiled the 800 KBytes of source code in seven seconds and transferred the program to the RAM of the Atari ST via a parallel cable. Development took six months. The subsequent port to Amiga took just seven days thanks to MacLean avoiding operating system calls as much as possible.

Fossil remains of animals now assigned to this genus, dated from 12.2 million years oldPage 52, , India's Ancient Past by R.S.Sharma in the Miocene, have been found since the 19th century in the Siwalik Hills of the Indian subcontinent as well as in Kutch. Any one of the species in this genus may have been the ancestor to the modern orangutans. Some early discoveries were given the separate names Ramapithecus (Rama's Ape) and Bramapithecus (Brahma's Ape), and were thought to be possible ancestors of humans. Discovery Jaw fragments of S. sivalensis. S. punjabicus jaw The first incomplete specimens of Sivapithecus were found in northern India in the late 19th century. Another find was made in Nepal on the bank of Tinau River, dovan v.d.c. of Palpa; a western part of the country in 1932. Now it is in Nature Museum Kathmandu. This find was named \\"Ramapithecus\\". The discoverer, G. Edward Lewis, claimed that it was distinct from Sivapithecus, as the jaw was more like a human's than any other fossil ape then known, a claim revived in the 1960s. At that time, it was believed that the ancestors of humans had diverged from other apes 14 million years ago. Biochemical studies upset this view, suggesting that there was an early split between orangutan ancestors and the common ancestors of chimpanzees, gorillas and humans. Meanwhile, more complete specimens of Ramapithecus were found in 1975 and 1976, which showed that it was less human-like than had been thought. It began to look more and more like Sivapithecus, meaning that the older name must take priority. It is also possible that fossils assigned to Ramapithecus belonged to the female form of Sivapithecus. They were definitely members of the same genus. It is also likely that they were already separate from the common ancestor of chimps, gorillas and humans, which may be represented by the prehistoric great ape Nakalipithecus nakayamai. Siwalik specimens once assigned to the genus Ramapithecus are now considered by most researchers to belong to one or more species of Sivapithecus. Ramapithecus is no longer regarded as a likely ancestor of humans. In 1982, David Pilbeam published a description of a significant fossil find, formed by a large part of the face and jaw of a Sivapithecus. The specimen bore many similarities to the orangutan skull and strengthened the theory (previously suggested by others) that Sivapithecus was closely related to orangutans. In 2011, a 10.8 million-year old (Neogene period) upper jawbone of Shivapithecus was found in Kutch district of Gujarat, India. The find also extended Sivapithecus' southern range in Indian subcontinent significantly. The species can not be identified. Description Sivapithecus was about in body length, similar in size to a modern orangutan. In most respects, it would have resembled a chimpanzee, but its face was closer to that of an orangutan. The shape of its wrists and general body proportions suggest that it spent a significant amount of its time on the ground, as well as in trees. It had large canine teeth, and heavy molars, suggesting a diet of relatively tough food, such as seeds and savannah grasses. Species Currently three species are generally recognized: *Sivapithecus indicus fossils date from about 12.5 million to 10.5 million years ago.A partial hominoid innominate from the Miocene of Pakistan: Description and preliminary analyses *Sivapithecus sivalensis lived from 9.5 million to 8.5 million years ago. It was found at the Pothowar plateau in Pakistan as well as in parts of India. The animal was about the size of a chimpanzee but had the facial morphology of an orangutan; it ate soft fruit (detected in the toothwear pattern) and was probably mainly arboreal. *Sivapithecus parvada described in 1988, this species is significantly larger and dated to about 10 million years ago.

Bozlak, which is a form of uzun hava (long tune) in Turkish Folk Music, has been a form of music starting from Central Anatolia and an expression of the cultures of the Yoruk / Turkmen and Avshar tribes which pursue a way of life based on yaylak (summer highland pasture)- and kislak (winter pasture). In terms of meaning, the word ‚Äòbozlak‚Äô has the meanings of to shout, to yell, to cry out, and to burst out. The bursting out of the sorrow, desolation and the outbreak that the Turkmens and Avshars experienced in daily life to the nature caused the emergence of the bozlak culture. Turkmens, Avshars and the Abdals who existed among these tribes have transferred the tradition of bozlak to our day. The term ‚Äòbozlak‚Äô means to scream, to revolt; ‚Äòto struggle‚Äô and with this frame this term is used to deal with social concepts such as death, separate, and pain, and it is seen in the several parts of the country especially in the Middle Anatolia and √áukurova region, and two different style; ‚ÄòAvshar style‚Äô and ‚ÄòTurkmen style‚Äô is used in ‚Äòbozlak‚Äô thus, using two different makam (tones) proves that it cannot be explained only through ‚ÄòK√ºrdi‚Äô style.

Fort Wainwright is part of the Fairbanks North Star Borough and the coterminous with the Fairbanks Metropolitan Statistical Area. The installation is managed by U.S. Army Garrison Alaska (USAG Alaska) and the senior command is U.S. Army Alaska (USARAK). Fort Wainwright was formerly known as Ladd Field (1939-1945) and Ladd Air Force Base (1947-1961). Ladd Field was designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL) on 4 February 1985 and Ladd Air Force Base was designated as Ladd Air Force Base Cold War District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on the same day. Geography = Location = Fort Wainwright is located in the central interior region of Alaska. It lies between the Alaska Range in the South and the Brooks Range in the North. Fort Wainwright boundaries are located within the Fairbanks North Star Borough between two city borders. To the West is the City of Fairbanks, to the Southeast is the City of North Pole. Fort Wainwright resides on both sides of the Chena River, a 100-mile tributary of the Tanana River in the interior region of Alaska. At this latitude the Aurora Borealis can be visible during night hours. = Demographics = The total population to include the workforce on Fort Wainwright is approximately 15,000 personnel. There are roughly 6,500 military members, 5,700 military dependents, 1250 Civilian employees including appropriated and non-appropriated fund employees and over 400 contractors. = Climate = Fort Wainwright is located in a subarctic climate with seasonal temperature extremes. Temperature extremes have been recorded from ‚àí66 ¬∞F to +94 ¬∞F (‚àí54 ¬∞C to +34 ¬∞C). The average low temperature is in January at ‚àí17 ¬∞F (‚àí27 ¬∞C) with the average high temperature is during July at +73 ¬∞F (+22 ¬∞C). The annual precipitation averages 12 inches (305 mm) of rain and 37 inches (94 cm) of snow. Fort Wainwright is approximately 190 miles south of the Arctic Circle. The hours where the sun is above the horizon averages 22 hours in June with twilight during the night hours and less than 4 hours in December. The climate creates a short construction season for installation projects. It also potentially contributes to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) among the workforce. = Geology = Fairbanks falls in a region with discontinuous permafrost, a condition where permafrost is broken by pockets of unfrozen ground. This, coupled with the periglacial effect of seasonal freezing and thawing, can drastically modify the ground surface. Construction engineering in this environment requires additional planning to avoid the potential for hazards of ground movement or collapse.  Culture Resources  = Historic and Archeological Sites = Fort Wainwright has a Cultural Resources Management Program that is responsible for over 1.6 million acres of Army-managed land with a diverse array of resources including historical buildings, a national historic landmark, archeological sites, and properties of traditional religious and cultural significance. There are over 650 prehistoric archeological sites on Fort Wainwright and its training lands that date from the last ice age (14,000 years ago) to the Alaskan homesteading era. USAG Alaska have several agreements in place in regards to historical findings and archaeological digs. Partnerships include the State of Alaska Historical Preservation office and the University of Alaska Fairbanks‚Äô Museum of the North who curates the archeological relics. = Native Liaison = The U.S. Army Garrison Alaska (USAG Alaska) provides an Alaska Native Liaison that manages the Native Liaison/Government to Government program for Fort Wainwright. Fort Wainwright‚Äôs cantonment and training areas is made up of Army-withdrawn land that support resources that have been utilized by the Alaska Native community for thousands of years.

Then-Lt. Col. Henry ‚ÄòHap‚Äù Arnold led a flight of B-10 bombers from Washington D.C. to Alaska in 1934 scouting for potential airfields. His report recommended the establishment of an air base at Fairbanks which could support cold weather testing and serve as a tactical supply depot. In 1935, Congress passed the Wilcox National Air Defense Act which authorized the construction of new airbases including one in Alaska for cold weather testing and training. March 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt withdrew public land for the Army in Executive Order 7596 as the location for the airfield and the base. Congress approved appropriated funds in 1939 for the construction of Ladd Field, named after Maj Arthur Ladd, an Army Air Corps pilot who perished in an airplane crash in South Carolina while under sealed orders. = World War II =  Cold weather Test station  Cold weather test of flight clothes Ladd Field 1941 The construction of Ladd Field began in earnest early in 1940, prompted by the declaration of war in Europe months before. During its first two years of operations, Ladd Field‚Äôs mission was as a cold weather test station. The station commander was Maj. Dale V. Gaffney. The cold weather station focused primarily on testing aircraft performance and maintenance. Its major goal was to develop standard procedures for servicing and operating aircraft in subzero temperatures and to test various airplane parts and fluids. The testing program looked at other aspects of arctic operations to include clothing, communication, equipment, survival gear, medical issues, and ground support. During 1940-1942, Ladd Field was devoted to research and considered an ‚Äúexempt station‚Äù from combat. In June 1942, Japan bombed Dutch Harbor, on the Aleutian Island of Unalaska, and occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska. The Cold Weather Test Station was deactivated and Ladd Field came temporarily under control of the 11th Air Force who fell under the Alaska Defense Command. By fall of 1942, the Cold Weather test Station was reactivated and became an exempted research station again.  Lend-Lease Program  Land-Lease Program Final Check 1942 During 1940-1942, Ladd Field was devoted to research and considered an ‚Äúexempt station‚Äù from combat. In June 1942, Japan bombed Dutch Harbor, on the Aleutian Island of Unalaska, and occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska. The Cold Weather Test Station was deactivated and Ladd Field came temporarily under control of the 11th Air Force who fell under the Alaska Defense Command. By fall of 1942, the Cold Weather test Station was reactivated and became an exempted research station again. In 1942, under Lend-Lease agreements, the United States provided war planes and materials to the Soviet Union to use against Nazi Germany. Ladd Field was selected as the transfer point for Lend-Lease aircraft transiting the Alaska-Siberia (ALSIB) route. More than 7,900 aircraft were eventually delivered to Soviet pilots waiting at Ladd field who would then fly them to Nome and across Siberia to the eastern war front. To facilitate this mission, Ladd Field was transferred to the Air Transport Command (ATC) for the remainder of the war. Under the ATC, Ladd field expanded with a new hanger and runway along with hundreds of temporary building to house the large workforce needed to support the mission. By June of 1945 Ladd Field was capable of billeting 4,555 troops. Cold weather testing continued its mission as a tenant unit on Ladd. The conclusion of WWII marked the end of the Lend-Lease Program in September 1945. Military personnel left Alaska and Ladd Field was transferred from ATC back to 11th Air Force.  Women's Army Corps (WAC) at Ladd Field  WAC Review Ladd Field 1945 1st Lt. Woodall was the very first WAC to be stationed at Ladd Field, arriving in January 1945 to work as an aerial photographer with the Cold Weather Test Detachment. At Ladd Field, her duties included establishing the Extreme Temperature Operations Unit (ETOU) laboratory that tested photographic equipment on military aircraft. This required her to cross the Arctic Circle in a B-29 at high altitude making her the first armed forces female to fly to the arctic. The 1466th AAF Base Unit Squadron W arrived at Ladd Field in April. Maj. Betty Etten Wiker, then a 1st Lieutenant (1st Lt.) served as the WAC commanding officer at Ladd Field. The WAC served in various positions, from office work to performing field duty as medics and airplane mechanics. One tenth of the Ladd Field WACs were assigned duties within Army Airways Communication System (AACS). The WAC departed from Ladd Field in December 1945 after the end of the Lend-Lease Program.  The Cold War  In 1945, rivalry developed between the United States and the Soviet Union resulting in the Cold War. The proximity of the Soviet Union to Alaska in a post-war long- range bomber age spurred the development of the Arctic front. The Arctic would encompass many activities for the Department of Defense to include use as a forward deployment zone and as a first line of defense in the region. In 1947, due to the National Securities Act, the Air Force was designated as a separate branch from the Army. Ladd Field was renamed Ladd Air Force Base commanded by the 11th Air Force. During this time Eielson airfield was established to supplement Ladd AFB with a separate B-36 bomber mission. In the early years of the Cold War, Ladd AFB‚Äôs missions included; assessing the Soviet presence in the Arctic by strategic reconnaissance; supplying a regional air defense asset; improvement of the practice of polar navigation; and continued cold weather testing of equipment, clothing and human performance. In 1948, the Army sent the 2nd Infantry Division to Ladd AFB with a mission of ground defense. During the Korean War in 1950 and through to 1957 Ladd AFB saw an rise in tempo and an increase in their logistics operations. The base became the logistical support center for Alaska‚Äôs defense projects. Research expanded creating an ice station research center to analysis and track polar ice packs; perform geophysics projects and expand communication networks. The 4th Infantry Regiment provided the combat mission man power through 1956. B-29 with dog team Ladd AFB (USAF By 1957, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and satellites reduced the role for Ladd AFB. In 1960, with two major airbases in close proximity, coupled with economic pressures, the Air Force stopped flying operations at Ladd and reassigned them to Eielson AFB and to Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage. The Air Force transferred Ladd to the Army on 1 January, 1961, and the installation was renamed Fort Wainwright after WWII General, Jonathan Wainwright. In 1963, the 171st Infantry Brigade (mechanized) was activated at Fort Wainwright to defend Eielson AFB. Several elements of the 171st IN (Mech) deployed to Vietnam in 1966. In 1969, the 171st Infantry transitioned from mechanized to light infantry and were subsequently inactivated in 1972 from Fort Wainwright. Ladd Field was designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL) on 4 February 1985. Ladd Air Force Base was designated as Ladd Air Force Base Cold War District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on the same day. In 1986, Fort Wainwright expanded their mission beyond the Arctic to support world-wide deployments. USARAL was discontinued in 1974. This left the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson to assume control of the Army in Alaska, reporting directly to FORSCOM at Fort McPherson, Georgia. In 1986, the 6th Infantry Division (light) was assigned to Fort Richardson and assumed the role of overall Army Command in Alaska from the 172nd Infantry Brigade. The 6th ID provided a rapid-deployment worldwide strike force and participated in worldwide training events. = Post-cold War = In 1994, U.S. army Alaska (USARAK) was activated and replaced the 6th Infantry Division, reestablishing the Alaskan Command. The 2004 Army Modernization Plan, created to facilitate deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, created modular brigade combat teams. This configuration transformed the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson into the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), 25th Infantry Division (1/25 SBCT) stationed at Fort Wainwright becoming its dominant warfighting unit. The newly transformed 4/25 BCT (Airborne) remained at Fort Richardson. The current mission of the 1/25 SBCT is to deploy rapidly ‚Äúto a designated contingency area of operation by air and [conduct] operations either as a separate Brigade Combat Team or under the control of a contingency force headquarters.‚Äù Equipped with wheeled Stryker armored vehicles, the brigade filled the gap between light forces like the 4/25 BCT (Airborne) and heavy, armored units. Training and Recreation Areas Fort Wainwright manages over 1.6 million acres of training and recreation land. Training areas include Tanana Flats, Yukon, Donnelly, Black Rapids and Gerstle River. Seasonally, these areas can be used by the military and the public for recreation activities by obtaining a Recreation Access Permit. The U.S. Army Recreation Tracking Systems (USARTRAK) has been established to facilitate public access on Fort Wainwright training lands and allows recreational users to check in by phone or online. The USARTRAK website has updated training area map information depicting impact areas and off limit areas. It also shows when and where certain training areas will be temporarily restricted during training exercises. Fort Wainwright manages specialized outdoor recreation areas in the cantonment area to include Chena Bend Clubhouse and Golf Course, Birch Hill Ski and snowboard Area, Fischer Skeet range and two RV and tent campgrounds. Fort Wainwright also manages the Seward Military Resort located on the Kenai Peninsula.  Controversy  = Quality of Life = In 2019, a behavioral health epidemiological consultation, or EPICON, was requested after Alaskan Congressman Don Young sent a letter to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army and Commanding General, U.S. Army Medical Command requesting a team of medical professionals to be sent to Fort Wainwright to examine the situation on the ground in relation to a number of reported suicides. Observed findings were consistent with suicide cases in previous EPICONs. Soldiers who died by suicide had indications of multiple risk factors, these included chronic pain, relationship issues, and trouble sleeping. Concurrently, in 2019, the Army initiated a pilot program to target quality-of-life improvements at Fort Irwin, California; Fort Polk, Louisiana; and Fort Wainwright, Alaska. GEN Gus Perna, Commander for the Army Materiel Command (AMC), emphasized that increasing quality of life across the force remains a top priority for Army senior leaders. GEN Perna stated that \\"Quite frankly, Fort Wainwright is in an austere environment, ‚Ä¶Fort Irwin and Fort Polk are also austere, but it is where we do all of our [brigade combat team] training. We send our best leaders at all levels that go train our BCTs ‚Ä¶ to places that don't have a lot of quality of life.\\" On Fort Wainwright, USARAK and USAG Alaska implemented a number of Quality of Life initiatives that included blackout curtains barracks to boost the ability to sleep during the 24-hours of sunlight in the summer, planning the construction of winter maintenance facilities to improve workplace quality during extreme cold weather and generous leave policies for soldier‚Äôs allowing for more time with family in an attempt to reduce an isolation effect in an austere environment. = Environmental contamination = Since 1978, Fort Wainwright has been participating in the Department of Defense Installation Restoration Program to investigate and clean up contamination. In 1985 and 1986, lead and chromium were detected in monitoring wells at the landfill; in 1987, chromium and tetrahydrofuran were detected in monitoring wells at the proposed housing area, and chromium was detected in soil. About 15,000 people live and work at the fort and obtain drinking water from wells in close proximity to contaminated source areas. The Chena River also runs through the contaminated area of Fort Wainwright.  National Priorities Listing  In August 1990 Fort Wainwright was registered on the national priorities list as a Superfund. In most source areas, groundwater is contaminated with solvents and petroleum products, in a few source areas, with pesticides and/or fuel additives. Soil contains some solvents, waste oil, waste fuel/petroleum products, pesticides, paint residues, fuel tank sludge and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Sediments contain PAHs and low level pesticides. Contaminants on the site also include mercury.  Taku Gardens  To meet the needs of new personnel and their families, construction of 128 homes on a 54-acre housing project known as Taku Gardens began in 2005 on the former communications site. In June, 2005 construction workers noticed \\"stained soil and unusual odors during excavation of a building foundation\\" and laboratory testing revealed the presence of PCB at concentrations of up to 115,000 mg/kg - Alaska's current clean-up standard is 1 mg/kg. Further testing of the site revealed the presence of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, chlorinated compounds including solvents, herbicides, pesticides, dioxins, and \\"munitions-related compounds\\" such as nitroaromatics and propellants. Construction was suspended August‚ÄìSeptember 2005 and continued until end of 2006. A January, 2007 Army audit questioned \\"the wisdom of building a family housing complex on top of a known 1950s-era military landfill\\" and concluded that \\"the situation with the Taku construction project is the direct result of multiple individuals failing to adhere to Army and federal regulations and guidance. From 2007 to 2010 drums and debris were excavated, PCB contaminated soil was removed and backfilled, but some fuel and volatile organic compound-contaminated soil and groundwater remains on site. Construction of the housing project resumed during the summer of 2011. In the intervening years, many housing units between Taku Gardens and the main gate were reconstructed or renovated, with new housing built as well. Immediately northeast of Taku Gardens, Bear Paw was built on a part of the former site of Bassett Army Hospital, while construction of new homes began on the rest of the site in 2011. Immediately northeast of Bear Paw, Denali Village, a much larger development, was constructed between Glass Park and the former billeting. Taku Gardens area, the newer housing across from Bassett Hospital was renamed to Tanana Trails in 2015.  Hangar 6  In June, 2006, civilian construction workers at Aircraft Maintenance Hangar No. 6 ‚Äì known by the Corps of Engineers to be a designated Hazardous Waste Accumulation point ‚Äì were overcome by fumes described as \\"pungent, chalky and metallic tasting\\" and suffered nausea, headaches and other symptoms. A state health report concluded that \\"an unknown, volatile chemical likely caused nerve damage to the disabled workers.\\" More than 30 workers were hospitalized and at least 4 have suffered lasting disabilities. The workers initiated a civil suit against the Army which was dismissed because the workers were limited to state workers‚Äô compensation as their only relief.  Underground storage fuel tanks  EPA inspections found that from at least 2012 to 2013, Fort Wainwright failed to monitor underground storage tanks regularly, perform leak detection tests, and investigate suspected releases. The Army paid a penalty of nearly $158,700.

This is a list of groups, both web-based and warez scene groups, which have attained notoriety outside of their respective communities. A plurality of warez groups operate within the so-called warez scene, though as of 2019 a large amount of software and game warez is now distributed first via the web. Leaks of releases from warez groups operating within the \\"scene\\" still constitute a large amount of warez shared globally. Between 2003 and 2009 there were 3,164 active groups within the warez scene, with the majority of these groups being active for no more than two months and with only a small fraction being active for many years. The warez scene is a very competitive and volatile environment, largely a symptom of participation in its community being illegal in most countries. Groups are generally not driven by profit, but by reputation. Groups =3DM= 3DM is a Chinese video game cracking group. Their founder and leader is reported to be a woman using the pseudonym \\"‰∏çÊ≠ªÈ∏ü\\" (pinyin: b√π s«ê ni«éo; meaning in English: Phoenix) but the identity or gender has never been confirmed. Unusual for piracy groups, 3DM's members have public profiles on the social network Sina Weibo, and use a blog to inform the public about their activities. Some members of 3DM have previously been part of NETSHOW (now known as ALI213), a group which released Chinese language copies of games using stolen cracks directly to warez scene FTP sites. 3DM were one of the first peer to peer file sharing groups to offer cracks for games which utilized DRM produced by Denuvo. As newer versions of Denuvo DRM became more challenging to reverse engineer, 3DM gave up trying to crack games with Denuvo DRM. In 2016 the group claimed that piracy of games produced by large developers and publishers would be impossible in the coming years, due to the technological challenges of reverse engineering and ultimately cracking the virtualization and licensing schemes employed by new DRM solutions like Denuvo. One of the most notable groups on the web at the time, they publicly announced a year hiatus from developing cracks for games. Since returning in 2017, 3DM have only released games which use Steam licensing, only releasing copies of better protected games which include cracks made by other groups. This practice has been criticized by the groups whose cracks were included in releases under the 3DM name. =Automation= Automation was one of the largest cracking crew associations on the Atari ST. Several cracking groups were gathered under this label, most notably LSD, Was Not Was, The Lost Boys and Bad Brew Crew. They famously released their compact discs with each disk typically containing several games. Automation split up in the early 1990s after the release of Compact Disk 512. Several members founded a new cracking group called D-Bug. =Centropy= Centropy, founded in January 1999, was a warez group which specialized in releasing copies of films, many of which were still in theatres. Touting many \\"0-day\\" releases and releases prior to commercial availability, Centropy released and pre-released numerous films. =CLASS= CLASS (also known as CLS) was a warez group which was the target of federal raids such as Operation Fastlink. They were a global group with members worldwide, often releasing game \\"rips\\". The group ceased operations in 2004 after their 1,234th release. =CODEX= CODEX (also known as CDX) ‚Äì is a warez group founded at the end of February 2014. They are known for releasing copies of games which use Steam licensing and also for emulating Ubisoft's Uplay DRM protection. They were accused by the warez group SKIDROW of stealing their code to crack Trials Fusion, something CODEX denied, stating that they had written their own code for the DRM emulation. From 2016 to 2020 they have been one of the most active warez groups releasing commercial computer games with over 3700 releases in less than 6 years, compared to older groups like SKIDROW having fewer than 2500 over more than a decade of activity. In late 2017 CODEX gained notoriety by becoming the third scene group (and fifth overall entity) to crack Denuvo DRM when they released a cracked version of Middle-earth: Shadow of War on its release date. CODEX collaborated with STEAMPUNKS on at least one game which used Denuvo DRM, South Park: The Fractured But Whole, which they released under the name \\"CODEPUNKS\\". In February 2018 CODEX began releasing cracked copies of games from the Microsoft Windows Store. In mid-2018 CODEX began releasing cracked copies of games featuring the latest versions of Denuvo DRM, including updated versions of Assassin's Creed Origins and Far Cry 5, both of which used Uplay licensing DRM and contained additional anti-modification and anti-debugging code through the use of VMProtect. On February 1, 2019, CODEX published a cracked copy of Resident Evil 2, which used Denuvo DRM, 7 days after the worldwide commercial release of the game. In late June 2019, CODEX released two cracked copies of games which utilized Denuvo DRM, Shadow of the Tomb Raider and a cracked updated version of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. These cracks were previously released by an independent cracker on the web, attributed to the group \\"EMPRESS\\". Later, a cracker who self-identified as C0000005 began releasing cracks under the name EMPRESS as well, suggesting that they are one in the same and that C0000005 had access to source code for CODEX's cracks. On June 27, 2019 CODEX released a crack for Star Wars Battlefront 2, about 527 days after its commercial release. On October 29, 2019 they published a cracked copy of Borderlands 3, another game distributed with Denuvo DRM, 46 days after release. In late 2019, a crack developed by CODEX for Need for Speed: Heat, which uses Denuvo DRM, was leaked online, likely through their network of testers. Normally, the final cracks published by CODEX made use of anti-debugging tools like VMProtect or Themida, to impede reverse engineering efforts. This unfinished crack was not similarly protected. Subsequently, CODEX did not release any cracks for games using Denuvo DRM until June 2020, when they released cracked copies of Team Sonic Racing, Trials of Mana, The Quiet Man, and an updated version of Far Cry: New Dawn. =CONSPIR4CY= CONSPIR4CY (releasing mostly as CPY) is a warez group founded in 1999 in Italy. They rose in notoriety after releasing Rise of the Tomb Raider and Inside in August 2016 under the name of CONSPIR4CY, though they resumed using the 'CPY' tag shortly thereafter with the release of their cracked copy of Doom in September 2016. They became the first group to create proper cracks for games protected by the third iteration of Denuvo DRM software. They cracked Resident Evil 7: Biohazard only five days after its release, at the time the shortest amount of time taken to develop a crack for a Denuvo DRM- protected game. They also cracked Mass Effect: Andromeda, only ten days after its release. In July 2017 the warez group SKIDROW criticized the methods used by CONSPIR4CY to crack games using Denuvo DRM. In early 2018, CPY released cracked copies of Assassin's Creed Origins and Far Cry 5, which were compiled with the most recent version of Denuvo DRM, and had additional anti- modification and anti-debugging features through the use of VMProtect software and EasyAntiCheat. In November 2018 CPY released cracks for HITMAN 2, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, A Way Out, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Pro Evolution Soccer 2019, FIFA 19 - all of which featured the latest version of Denuvo DRM, with some using additional custom DRM or off the shelf DRM such as EACore and VMProtect. In December 2018, CPY published a cracked copy of Just Cause 4, which used the latest version of Denuvo DRM, on the day after its release. They also released a crack for Battlefield V on December 22, days after its official release. In January 2019, CPY released cracked copies of Ace Combat 7, Mutant Year Zero, and Strange Brigade, as well as the first episode of Life Is Strange 2 (titled \\"Roads\\") - all 4 titles using the latest versions of Denuvo DRM. In February 2019, CPY released Metro Exodus, which used the latest version of Denuvo DRM available, within 5 days of its release, as well as the second episode of Life Is Strange 2, titled \\"Rules\\". In September 2019, CPY published a cracked copy of the game Octopath Traveler, 93 days after its release. In November 2019, CPY released a cracked copy of Heavy Rain which featured the latest version of Denuvo DRM. After a long hiatus, CPY became active again in October 2020, releasing cracked copies of eFootball PES 2021, Pro Evolution Soccer, Mafia: Definitive Edition, and Death Stranding in a single day, all of which featured the latest version of Denuvo DRM. On 18th October 2020, CPY released Marvel Avengers which also features the latest version of Denuvo DRM. =DARKSiDERS (DARKZER0)= DARKSiDERS (also known as DS and DARKZER0) is a warez group releasing media formats under an application known as \\"0day\\" and ISOs under the tag of \\"-DARKZER0\\". The group have supposedly released since 2016 under DARKSiDERS (shortened as DS), although their first recorded release on Crackwatch was Iridescence on December 2018 under the name DARKZER0. DS released numerous other formats of pirated content including CD and Vinyl rips of Shows and Anime, MP3 and FLAC rips of music and music videos, eBook rips under the tag-dbOOk and various other Pornographic content under the tag -JAVSiDERS. Notoriety of DARKZER0 among anime and otaku culture has been quite positive among the releases of DARKZER0. They have cracked numerous adult games as well as adult novels, anime and other Japanese pornographic content. Additionally, DS has released rips of shows and content from Asia. DARKZER0 has been criticized by other crack groups, namely, SKIDROW, HOODLUM and CODEX (also known as PLAZA) for not adhering to cracking tradition and using more modern techniques and programs the likes of InnoSetup. =DEViANCE= One of the most prolific warez groups active from 1998 to 2006. Their dissolution has been described as the end of an era, and the current affiliation of ex-DEViANCE members is a reoccurring argument between groups. Describing members of a modern warez group as ex- DEViANCE became something of a joke within the warez scene. =DrinkOrDie= DrinkOrDie (also known as DoD) members were targeted by law enforcement in raids stemming from Operation Buccaneer. =Echelon= Echelon was a warez group which specialized in the release and distribution of console games, such as Dreamcast ISOs. =EViLiSO= Released American Pie on the Internet 3 months before its theatrical release. They branded their releases with a digital watermark of the letter \\"Z\\" which appeared in the corner of the frame. The bootleggers were associated with a web site in Argentina devoted to Quake. =FAiRLiGHT= FAiRLiGHT (releasing cracked games as FLT) is one of the oldest groups in warez scene, founded in 1987. As of 2017 the group seemingly focuses on demos and art, with their most recent release of cracked software in December 2016. FAiRLiGHT members were apprehended in raids stemming from the law enforcement Operation Fastlink. =Hoodlum= Hoodlum (also known as HLM) mainly focused on cracking games which utilized digital rights management solutions offered by Safedisc and Securom. They were targeted as part of the Operation Site Down raids in 2005. In July 2018, some group using the HOODLUM name resumed releasing unauthorized copies of games. =The Dream Team= The Dream Team (also known as \\"TDT\\") were the first warez group on the IBM PC to introduce intros or \\"crack'tros\\" to their game releases. It was one of the first IBM PC groups founded 1988 in Sweden and run by Hard Core or also known as HC/TDT. =The Humble Guys= The Humble Guys (also known as THG) were the first warez group to make use of NFO files to document their releases. =HATRED= Founded in late 2006, HATRED was very active during 2006 to 2007. ViTALiTY has claimed that HATRED were former members of DEViANCE. Some of their major releases included Rainbow Six: Vegas and Resident Evil 4. Their last release was in August 2008. =HYBRID= HYBRID (also known as HBD) was founded in 1993. HYBRID later split up when the US-members founded DYNAMIX (later PRESTIGE and PARADIGM). =International Network of Crackers= International Network of Crackers (also known as INC) was one of the premier cracking/releasing warez groups for the IBM PC during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The majority of their releases during 1993 were educational games for children. By early 1994, INC had completely disappeared from the warez scene. =Kalisto= Kalisto is a console warez group established in March 1998 which specializes in the release and distribution of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 ISO images, briefly moonlighting on the Dreamcast platform in mid-to-late 2000. =maVen= maVen were a film release group from October 2005 until the summer of 2006. Releases from maVen stopped when the FBI caught G√©r√©mi Adam, one of its key members. The 27-year-old Montreal resident has been sentenced to two and a half months in prison and was also ordered to complete 100 hours of community service. He pleaded guilty to distributing two major motion pictures: Invincible and How to Eat Fried Worms After the bust, releases ceased and another group called maVenssupplieR immediately took up the slack. In April 2010, the 28-year-old G√©r√©mi Adam died of a drug overdose at the Pointe-aux-Trembles home he shared with his girlfriend, Cynthia Laporte. mVs (Maven Supplier) released a workprint of Halloween three days before its official release on August 27, 2007. =Myth= Myth was a warez group, focused on cracking and ripping PC games. Besides ripped games, the group also released trainers and cracked updates for games. =PARADOX= PARADOX (also known as PDX and sometimes PARADiSO) was founded in 1989, mainly cracking games for the Amiga. They went on to crack software for the Windows operating system and other consoles. They were one of the earliest groups to successfully crack Windows Vista, which was supposed to be a difficult task based on changes Microsoft had made to the activation scheme for the software. PARADOX attracted attention from 2011 to 2012, as they published files for playing unauthorized copies of games on the Sony PlayStation 3.https://predb.ovh/?q=PS3%20TB%20%40team%20PARADOX%7CPARADiSO%7CPDX&page;=8 These copies required the use of a commercially-available USB dongle, which has been criticized as a form of commercial copyright infringement, and described as a \\"ReDRM\\" dongle because copies of game binaries were essentially decrypted using Sony's official keys, and then re-encrypted using the keys stored on the dongle, requiring the use of the dongle to bypass the DRM which had been added back to the games.https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps3/ReDRM_/_Piracy_dongles#Description It is unclear whether groups like PARADOX had any affiliation with the creators and distributors of so-called \\"ReDRM\\" dongles, including potentially having profited from the release of these dongles by drumming up demand by releasing copies of games which only worked when used with the dongle. PARADOX is well known for developing a utility known as \\"Preee\\",https://predb.ovh/?q=Preee%20%40team%20PARADOX which automates the creation of NFO files and the packaging of warez releases into multi-part RAR archives and subsequent creation of ZIP archives containing those RAR files depending on the warez scene rules being followed. In July 2020, after 3 years of inactivity, someone published a cracked copy of Monster Hunter: World, a game utilizing Denuvo DRM, with its Iceborn DLC using the name and NFO template of the group PARADOX.https://predb.ovh/?q=%20Monster.Hunter.World.Iceborne-PARADOX =Phrozen Crew= PC World (December 1999) Phrozen Crew (PC), founded in 1993 by tKC, was one of the most popular groups of computer software crackers, utilizing the tagline \\"We always get what we want!\\" . =Pirates With Attitudes= The Pirates With Attitudes (also known as PWA) were a major international warez release group from 1992 until 2000. The group was formed by two former INC members known by the pseudonyms Orion and Bar Manager. PWA members were the subjects of law enforcement raids after the passing of the No Electronic Theft or \\"NET\\" Act. =Project X= Project X exclusively released games for the Xbox. In 2004, Project X was named as one of six groups targeted as part of Operation Fastlink by the United States Department of Justice. =PROPHET= PROPHET is a subgroup of or otherwise affiliated in some way with RELOADED, whose cracks they re-use in releasing multi-language versions of games. They also tend to release copies containing the latest game content such as DLCs. These are often stylized as MULTi. For example, MULTi7 meaning the release is a copy containing 7 languages - usually some combination of English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Czech, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, or some other European language. =Rabid Neurosis= Rabid Neurosis (RNS) was an MP3 warez release organization which was founded on June 6, 1996. =Radium= Several verses of the rap song Hackers and the Crackers by Zearle are devoted to the group Radium. In 2004, evidence was presented that some of the system sound files included with the Microsoft Windows XP operating system, such as \`WMPAUD1.WAV\`, were authored using an unlicensed version of Sound Forge which was supplied by Radium. =Razor 1911= Razor 1911 (also known as RZR and RazorDOX) was founded in 1985 in Norway. Its primary bulletin board system was based in Norway. The group's main focus was to crack software for the Commodore 64 personal computer, but they also released Amiga and the IBM PC software. They were subjects of raids in Operation Buccaneer and Operation Fastlink. The group made a comeback in June 2006, and since then has cracked modern copy protection schemes such as Rockstar Games Social Club, Ubisoft's persistent Internet connection requiring DRM, and Battle.NET. In March 2012, Razor1911 announced that their tester and coder DYCUS, who had an active role in making trainers and testing the group's releases, had died of cancer. Since then, the group has seldom released cracked games, focusing on DRM-free titles from GOG.com, as well as games for Linux and macOS. =RELOADED= RELOADED (also known as RLD!) was founded in June 2004. Their founders are believed to be ex-DEViANCE members, though their rival group HOODLUM claimed in December 2004 that none of DEViANCE's previous leaders had ever been part of RELOADED. The group has cracked several modern protection schemes like SecuROM 8, Blizzard's Battle.NET, and Arxan Anti- Tamper. =REVOLT= REVOLT gained popularity for creating solutions for cracked games to have working multiplayer features, and later for cracks of games using Denuvo DRM which were released by its founder. REVOLT was founded by a Bulgarian teenager, who used the online handle Voksi. In July 2018 the REVOLT website began redirecting to the website of the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior. The same month, Voksi, then in his twenties, reported having been raided by Bulgarian law enforcement in response to a complaint filed by Denuvo parent company Irdeto. In comments made to media organisation TorrentFreak, Voksi alleged that \\"five or six officers, including two from Bulgaria's General Directorate for Combatting Organized Crime (GDBOB) and others from a local police station\\" entered his home and seized personal computing equipment. =Risciso= Risciso (stylized as RISCISO) was an online warez group, founded in approximately 1993, dedicated to distributing newly released copyrighted software, games and movies. =SKIDROW= SKIDROW is a well-known cracking group originally formed in 1990, cracking games for the Amiga platform, and having used the motto \\"Twice the Fun - Double the Trouble!\\" since then. A piece of cracktro software released by SKIDROW in 1992 with the game 10 Pinball Fantasies contained a complete list of their membership at the time. The most recent incarnation of SKIDROW began releasing unauthorized copies of games in June 2007, when they announced their return to cracking software. They were the first scene group to crack the version of Ubisoft's Uplay DRM which required players to have a persistent Internet connection to Ubisoft's licensing servers, first in Assassin's Creed II and then in Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. The group has released cracks for Denuvo Anti-Tamper protected games, Yesterday Origins and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - A Criminal Past. It is believed the former had a bad implementation of Denuvo which made it easier to reverse engineer, mostly due to a lack of support from Denuvo for protecting games written in C# and specifically games using the Unity game engine, with this lack of support having been previously demonstrated by an anonymous independent cracker having developed a crack for Syberia 3, which also used Unity. The crack for the latter was actually determined to be a modified executable file from the game Deus Ex: Breach, a free game which did not incorporate Denuvo's software, released by the same developers and utilizing the same engine, which had been modified slightly to load the assets from Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. A plurality of SKIDROW's current releases are cracked versions of games that make use of Steam licensing. In July 2017, in a statement released to commemorate their 10th consecutive year of releases since re-emerging in the PC game cracking scene, SKIDROW made cryptic remarks that the techniques used by CONSPIR4CY, STEAMPUNKS, and members of the Steam Underground warez forum to crack modern copy protections are not proper. These criticisms were themselves criticized on the web, as SKIDROW's apparent standards for a proper crack would seemingly disqualify both their most notable crack of Ubisoft's persistent online connection requiring DRM, which they emulated, and their most recent notable release of a Denuvo-protected game, which they cracked by modifying the executable from another game. =Steam Underground= While not precisely a group, the community centered around the Steam Underground web forum (also known as cs.rin.ru and its members have been a notable source of warez development, releases, tools, tutorials, discussions, and information pertinent to other groups since at least 2008. The forum has both Russian and English language boards, and is the home to a number of projects primarily focused on cracking, emulating, and otherwise extending the capabilities of Steam and games released on Steam. Games on other platforms may also be discussed on their own board. The Steam Underground forums are auxiliary to the warez scene, however the formal and informal collaboration between its users arguably constitutes a warez group. Members of Steam Underground have individually and collectively cracked games featuring DRM schemes such as the version of Ubisoft's Uplay which required players to maintain a persistent Internet connection to their licensing servers, Steam Custom Executable Generation, Arxan Anti-Tamper, Denuvo Anti-Tamper, and more - both generic digital distribution licensing schemes as well as custom protection, such as the copy protection triggers implemented by game developer Croteam in The Talos Principle and their Serious Sam franchise. Tools and techniques released on the forums have been used to make multiplayer game modes accessible in cracked copies of games, usually enabling pirates to play with other pirates. The cracker known as Baldman released the vast majority of his cracks for Denuvo-protected games on Steam Underground. A Bulgarian hacker known as Voksi used the Steam Underground forums as a point of distribution for cracks of games with advanced virtual machines, such as Denuvo. In early 2018, Voksi, in collaboration with another Steam Underground user and with material support from a member of Chinese cracking group 3DM, began releasing cracks for previously uncracked games and updated builds of titles which utilized Denuvo DRM. Voksi alleged in July 2018, after his personal site began redirecting to a Bulgarian government site, that he was raided by Bulgarian law enforcement at the behest of Denuvo's parent company. This parent company claimed responsibility for the law enforcement inquiry into Voksi in a press release. The forum and its members have often been referenced as some variation of \\"the Russian site/forum\\" or directly by name by warez scene groups in statements which mention the site. At least one prominent member of the forum has been in contact with warez scene release group members, as they published several non- public cracks for The Sims 4 which they attributed to tools or methods obtained from the cracking group RELOADED. This individual was then given access or knowledge related to EA's Origin licensing scheme and DRM, as they began to release their own cracks for updated versions of The Sims 4 based on the same cracking technique. Notable users of the Scene Underground forum include various individuals who have cracked Denuvo DRM: Baldman, Voksi, DeltaT, FCKDRM (not to be confused with the anti-DRM activism campaign begun by GOG.com), and C0000005 (a former CODEX member, also known as EMPRESS). Other notable members are syahmixp (creator of SmartSteamEmu), UberPsyX (author of the kernel mode driver used by Voksi to crack Denuvo games), Steam006 (creator of LumaPlay, a generic Uplay DRM Emulator, and GreenLuma, a tool for accessing unlicensed games and content with a running copy of Steam) and Mr_Goldberg (creator of an emulator for Steamworks multiplayer to add LAN- based multiplayer functionality to games, as well as having developed cracks for games using Arxan and Rockstar Social Club DRM). =STEAMPUNKS= STEAMPUNKS released unauthorized copies of games which utilized Denuvo digital rights management solutions in 2017, with their first releases being copies of Dishonored 2, ADR1FT, Planet Coaster, and ABZU. Releases by STEAMPUNKS include a license generator which creates a valid hardware ID-based license file. These licenses appear to be identical to those generated by the web-based activation servers operated by Denuvo, and they do not trigger Denuvo's DRM copy protection. This method attracted some attention upon its debut, while license generators and \\"keymakers\\" were fairly common in commercial software piracy, they had fallen out of use in cracking games as most games moved to the license management capabilities provided by Steam and other digital distribution platforms. One negative reaction to STEAMPUNKS' license maker came from the warez group SKIDROW in a statement from the group released in July 2017. In late September 2017, STEAMPUNKS became the first warez group to release cracked copies of Denuvo DRM-protected games within 24 hours of their commercial availability, releasing both Total War: Warhammer II and FIFA 18 on the same day they were made available for consumers. STEAMPUNKS collaborated with CODEX to crack South Park: The Fractured But Whole upon its release, with the cracked release appearing under the portmanteau group name \\"CODEPUNKS\\". Following this and one other collaborative release, STEAMPUNKS became inactive, while CODEX continued to publish cracked versions of games. At least one of STEAMPUNKS' crackers was originally a member of X-FORCE (known for their Adobe software keygens), and at least one other member of STEAMPUNKS would become a member of CODEX after the group became inactive. =Superior Art Creations= Superior Art Creations (SAC) is an underground artscene group which caters primarily to, and is well known within, the warez scene. =SSM= Space Sound Music is a private music affiliated with some music collectors in psytrance/dark/hitech and some more alternative styles. =Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated= Tristar and Red Sector, Inc. (also known as TRSI) began as an alliance between two warez groups: Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated. They were formed in 1990 as a cooperative Commodore 64 demo coding and cracking group. TRSI migrated from the Commodore 64 release platform to the Amiga and IBM-PC, and eventually branched off into the console gaming scene before finally disbanding their warez division. In late 2003, TRSI became inactive and remains so today. =United Software Association= The United Software Association (also known as USA) was a prominent IBM PC games and applications warez group during the 1990s. USA formed an alliance with the PC warez division of Fairlight which was known as \\"USA/FLT\\". In late January 1992, several members of USA were arrested by the United States Secret Service and the Farmington Hills, Michigan police for credit card fraud. =VACE= VACE was founded in September 2003, and focused on cracking and ripping PC games. Besides ripped games, the group also releases trainers. =ViTALiTY= ViTALiTY (also known as VTY) was founded in May 2005. It has been suggested they were former members of DEViANCE. The group was considered blacklisted by many in the warez scene in October 2007, something ViTALiTY claims was orchestrated by rival groups RELOADED and FAiRLiGHT, though the latter claim they were against it. ViTALiTY was accused of either reporting or threatening to report members of other groups to the FBI, though ViTALiTY claimed a senior member of RELOADED threatened to do the same to them. ViTALiTY's last release was an update to Dragon Age: Origins on 7 January 2011.

Originating in Korea during Japanese colonial rule in the first half of the 20th century, Trot was influenced by many genres of Korean, Japanese, U.S. and European music. Trot has been around for almost 100 years and its distinct singing style has been continuously evolving. Trot music got its shape in rhythms during Japanese colonial rule. After the liberation of the Korean peninsula and the Korean War (1950-1953), talented artists such as Lee Mi-Ja, Choi Sook-ja, Bae Ho, Nam Jin, Na Hun-a, Joo Hyun- mi and many others helped to make Trot popular. With the rise of K-pop from the 1990s onwards, Trot music lost some popularity and was viewed as more old- fashioned. However, from 2000s onwards, young Trot singers such as Jang Yoon- jeong, Hong Jin-young and K-pop singers such as Super Junior-T, Daesung and Lizzy, renewed interest in the genre and popularised it among young listeners. Although the genre originated before the division of the Korean peninsula, Trot is now mainly sung in South Korea; the associated pop culture in North Korea no longer exists as propaganda music has since displaced other musical forms.Choi Cheok-ho (2001): \\"So-called People music in North Korea\\", pp. 64-71. PDF (in Korean) (ÏµúÏ≤ôÌò∏: \\"Î∂ÅÌïúÏùò ÏùåÏïÖ: ÎåÄÏ§ëÍ∞ÄÏöî\\", ÌÜµÏùºÍ≤ΩÏ†ú, 2001 (5¬∑6).Unification Ministry: Music in North Korea (in Korean).  Etymology  The name \\"trot\\" is a shortened form of \\"foxtrot,\\" a style of ballroom dance that influenced the simple two-beat rhythm of Trot music. Trot and foxtrot do not share any other notable characteristics.Lee Yeong-mi (revised 2013): \\"Trot\\" in: Encyclopedia of Korean Cultur via internet. (in Korean) (Ïù¥ÏòÅÎØ∏: \\"Ìä∏Î°úÌä∏\\", ÌïúÍµ≠ÎØºÏ°±Î¨∏ÌôîÎåÄÎ∞±Í≥ºÏÇ¨Ï†Ñ).Oxford Grove Music Online under keyword 'Korea' edited by Robert C. Provine, Okon Hwang and Keith Howard.  Characteristics  =Rhythm= simple duple, triple and quadruple metre patterns are common in Trot music Trot is known for being composed in a two-beat rhythm, also known as duple metre. In its early days, Trot music was often composed using the pentatonic scale and minor keys. This pattern is called anhemitonic scale or anhemitonic pentatonic scale, which was characteristic in early Japanese enka and other folk music such as Korean 'Gyeonggi-minyo'.Also some of K-pop's song uses the pentatonic scale, see Lee Sang-uk (2016): \\"The Continuation and Variation of K-pop Musical Styles\\", in: Sungshin Women's Uni. Journal of Humanities 34, p.362. (in Korean) (Ïù¥ÏÉÅÏö±: \\"K-pop ÏùåÏïÖÏ†Å ÏÑ±Ìñ•Ïùò ÏßÄÏÜçÍ≥º Î≥ÄÏù¥\\", ÏÑ±Ïã†Ïó¨ÎåÄ Ïù∏Î¨∏Í≥ºÌïôÏó∞Íµ¨ Ï†ú34Ïßë, pp. 353-394 KISS). The pentatonic scale consists of five degrees: of the natural major scale, the 4th and 7th degree are omitted, and to form the pentatonic minor scale, all these 5 degrees will descend 3 degrees. Before 1950, the pentatonic minor scale dominated in popularity, however, the pentatonic major scale has started to become more popular.Lee Jun-hee (2015): \\"Extension of Trot in 1940-1950 years\\", Journal of the Asian Music 38, pp. 75-94. PDF (in Korean) (Ïù¥Ï§ÄÌù¨: \\"1940-50ÎÖÑÎåÄ Ìä∏Î°úÌä∏Ïùò ÌôïÏû•: Ïû•Ï°∞ÌôîÏùò ÎèÑÏûÖÍ≥º Î≥ÄÏö©\\", ÎèôÏñëÏùåÏïÖ Ï†ú38Ïßë). ref b: p. 84-85. After the Japanese occupation, Trot music was composed using the heptatonic scale and major keys. In trot music, lower tones are generally sung with vibrato, while higher tones are sung with the flexing or turning technique called 'kkeokk-ki' (literally means flexing, Korean: Í∫æÍ∏∞). : Kkeokk-ki : The 'Kkeokk-ki' technique may be better explained by the gruppetto ornament of the classical music theory. A note is figured, as if it had been split into two or four subsidiary notes. And the voice is inflected to these imaginary notes: e.g. one quarter note is split into four sixteenth notes: (1) one in original pitch - (2) one in upper pitch - (3) one in lower pitch - (1) one in original pitch again (see below image, the example measure is from Na Hun-a's \\"Turning Waterwell\\"). Kkeokk-ki happens in the transition between two notes in original pitch. For the ordinary listeners, it is not easy to quickly perceive the subtlety of this technique. However, any Trot singer can hardly do without the elaborated effect of Kkeokk-ki. 800px =Lyrics= Most of Trot's lyrical content is based on two popular themes, although they vary with the times: 1) love and parting, 2) longing for sweet home. Some see the origin of this sentimentalism in \\"colonial tragedy\\". But that may well be related to the ancient tradition of resentment () in Korean culture.About the term 'Han' see Daniel Tudor (2012): \\"Korea: The Impossible Country\\", Boston, p. 121. Elegiac song texts with minor scale are the most common. In addition to elegiac rhythm and the content of the lyrics, the 'new stream' in the theater (), introduced since the 1910s from Japan, has also contributed to the fact that Trot is dominated by the moods of compassion and pain. Because the pieces of this 'new stream' frequently dealt with themes such as the family tragedy, love affairs - the best pieces were \\"Janghanmong\\" (), \\"Cheated in Love, Cried of Money\\" (); the great hit song \\"Don't Cry Hongdo\\" (ÌôçÎèÑÏïº Ïö∏ÏßÄ ÎßàÎùº) sings just the tragic story of the piece \\"Cheated in love, Cried of money\\". So it is understandable that many Koreans tend to be sad or compassionate when they hear Trot songs. Sentimental words like 'crying' and 'leaving' have been consistently the most popular. But speech levels, which is recognizable at sentence final ending in Korean, have changed with the times; since 1990 year the sentence in the level low politeness () is used often.Jang So-won (2015): \\"Text analysis of writing style in Korean popular music\\", Text linguistics 39, p. 283-311. (in Korean) (Ïû•ÏÜåÏõê: \\"ÌïúÍµ≠ ÎåÄÏ§ëÍ∞ÄÏöî Í∞ÄÏÇ¨Ïùò Î¨∏Ï≤¥ Î∂ÑÏÑù\\", ÌÖçÏä§Ìä∏Ïñ∏Ïñ¥Ìïô 39Ìò∏). =Performance= Trot music is mainly performed by one singer or at most duet. It is rare for a Trot singer to play any instrument while singing. The playing of the instruments has something of an accompaniment function. The song usually being played by a band orchestra. Band orchestras use mostly backing vocals, usually consisting of 4 female vocalists, but rarely of mixed vocalists. The Trot music shows often include a group of dancers. Thus, a typical broadcasting band orchestra for Trot consists of instrument players, chorus and dancers. Of course, it is possible for a singer to perform a song accompanied by one or two instruments; e.g. Joo Hyun-mi sings in her YouTube channel, accompanied only by guitar and accordion.She sings directly in a simple studio exclusively for YouTube viewer. Ju Hyeon-mi channel (YouTube). Apart from the talent of a singer, the composer plays an important role in the success of a Trot song. Since there are few Trot singers and songwriters, a Trot singer often gets his own singing style with the composer who always prepares a song for release with the singer. Naming The name trot has been widely used since the 1980s, even though the designation itself dates back to the 1950s. In the 1920s the name yuhaeng-changga () was in use;Kim Byeong-seon (1990): \\"Studies on Changa in the time of Enlightenment in Korea\\", (Doctoral dissertation, Jeonnam University). Retrieved from RISS. (in Korean) (ÍπÄÎ≥ëÏÑ†: \\"ÌïúÍµ≠ Í∞úÌôîÍ∏∞ Ï∞ΩÍ∞Ä Ïó∞Íµ¨\\", Ï†ÑÎÇ®ÎåÄÌïôÍµê Î∞ïÏÇ¨ÌïôÏúÑÎÖºÎ¨∏). this name comes from the fact that yuhaeng means \\"trend, fashion, popular\\", and all sorts of western music, e.g. hymn, nursery rhyme, folksong etc., as well as Japanese enka, which were introduced to the Korean people at the end of the 19th century, were called changga; ref a: p. 53, ref d: p. 62. popular music in the western style was called yuhaeng-changga, later abbreviated yuhaengga (). Trot is sometimes referred to as seongin-gayo (), which means \\"music for adults\\". Trot also has a newer name, jeontong-gayo (), literally \\"traditional popular song\\". Calling trot jeontong-gayo may implicitly refer to national self-confidence and give people a sense of self- esteem, so that the uncomfortable suspicion of foreign origin would be eased. The name daejung-gayo (), or \\"music for the public\\", has been used historically for trot, but it is a wider term for all sorts of popular music, so K-pop for example, also falls under the label of daejung-gayo. Additionally, instead of teuroteu (), the term teurot () is occasionally seen in written Korean. History =Origin= Trot music originated in Korea during Japan's period of colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. It is generally admitted that Trot's closest ancestors were Japanese enka. Trot and enka were formed in little time intervals, during the colonial period they were influenced by each other; if one wants to use the give and take principle, then Trot may be the taker rather than the giver. After the liberation of the Korean peninsula, however, Trot has continued on his own path.Lee Ju-won (June 2015): \\"A Comparative Study of Korean and Japanese Popular Music - With a Focus on 1945-1950\\", Japanese Studies Vol. 64, pp. 75Ôºç98, KISS. (in Korean) (Ïù¥Ï£ºÏõê: \\"Ìïú„ÉªÏùº ÏñëÍµ≠Ïùò ÎåÄÏ§ëÍ∞ÄÏöî ÎπÑÍµêÍ≥†Ï∞∞: 1945-1950ÎÖÑÏùÑ Ï§ëÏã¨ÏúºÎ°ú\\", ÏùºÎ≥∏Ïó∞Íµ¨ Ï†ú64Ìò∏). ref a: p. 75, ref b: p. 88. There is an investigation showing that the songs that were published in Korea and Japan between 1945 and 1950 used in both countries pretty much the same amount of duple metre rhythm in a minor scale. It is sometimes asserted that Trot's origins can be traced to 'Siga' (Korean: ÏãúÍ∞Ä), a traditional form of Korean poetry, although this only partially explains origins since it is relevant to poetic and lyrical aspects only.Bak Cheol-hee (revised 1995): \\"Siga\\" in: Encyclopedia of korean Culture (in Korean). (Î∞ïÏ≤†Ìù¨: \\"ÏãúÍ∞Ä\\", ÌïúÍµ≠ÎØºÏ°±Î¨∏ÌôîÎåÄÎ∞±Í≥ºÏÇ¨Ï†Ñ). Some suggest that Trot could have been influenced by Korean folk music, which does have some resemblance to Trot's vocal inflections, even if Korean traditional music's rhythmic structure differs from Trot's fixed duple metre. It was true that a genre of 'Sin-minyo' (i.e. 'new Korean folk song', Korean: Ïã†ÎØºÏöî) was in circulation in the 1930s;Full description about the Korean traditional Minyo and Sin-minyo see Kwon Do-hee (December 2014): \\"Industrial Folksong and the Popular Music in Modern Era\\", Journal of the Asian Music 36, pp. 167-223. PDF available. (in Korean) (Í∂åÎèÑÌù¨: Í∑ºÎåÄÍ∏∞ ÏÉÅÏóÖÎØºÏöîÏôÄ ÎåÄÏ§ëÏùåÏïÖ, ÎèôÏñëÏùåÏïÖ Ï†ú36Ïßë).Lee Yeong-mi (October 2006): \\"Inherit of traditional music\\", a paper presented at 'The 3rd World Congress of Korean Studies' PDF available.

It is an old controversial issue whether Trot originated during Japanese colonial rule and thus is not a genuine Korean popular music. This problem has caused quite a stir twice. Once the government took a position in the 1960s that the supposedly 'Japanese-tinged' songs suffered at the hands of the censor. The second discussion took place by the musicians and cultural critics in the 80s, called 'Ppongjjak debate'. 'Japanese-tinged' censorship The particular hostile emotional response to the former Japanese colonial rule has led the government to banish the Japanese legacy. This also happened in the cultural area. There were listed songs that seemed to have been influenced by enka. At the time, such songs were disparagingly called 'Japanese-tinged' () and the songs that violated conventional morality were called 'degenerate songs' ().The detailed backgrounds as well as relevant bibliography about the so-called 'Japanese-tinged controversy' see Jang Yu- jeong (2008): \\"Controversy about Korean Trot\\". PDF available (in Korean) (Ïû•Ïú†Ï†ï: \\"ÌïúÍµ≠ Ìä∏Î°úÌä∏ ÎÖºÏüÅÏùò ÏùºÍ≥†Ï∞∞\\", ÎåÄÏ§ëÏÑúÏÇ¨Ïó∞Íµ¨ 20Ìò∏, pp. 47-72). First, in 1965 the broadcasters decided not to send out any more 'Japanese-tinged' songs. To it responded the singer association with the vehement protest. After that, in 1968 'Art and Cultural Ethics Commission' (the earliest commission of today's 'Korea Communications Standards Commission') decided to banish 108 songs and later more; the reasons were mainly 'obscene, vulgar, degenerated and Japanese- tinged\\".Complete list of prohibited songs see Mun Ok-bae (October 2008): \\"Study about music control of government after the liberation', in: Journal of the Science and Practice Music, Vol. 22, pp. 30-33. PDF available. (in Korean) (Î¨∏Ïò•Î∞∞: \\"Ìï¥Î∞© Ïù¥ÌõÑ Ï†ïÎ∂ÄÏùò ÏùåÏïÖÌÜµÏ†ú Ïó∞Íµ¨\\", ÏùåÏïÖÎÖºÎã®, 22Ïßë). Lee Mi-ja's \\"Camellia Lady\\" was among the list in 1965 as well as in 1968. She once recalled, \\"The then President Park Chung-hee, who was blamed for the censorship, did not know that the song had been banned, so he asked her to sing it at a banquet.\\"Wang Seong-sang (2015): \\"Forbidden songs\\", pp. 80-81. PDF available. (in Korean) (ÏôïÏÑ±ÏÉÅ: \\"Í∏àÏßÄÍ≥°Îì§\\", Í∏∞Î°ùÏù∏IN No. 32, 76-83). The censorship culminated in the 1970s, most affected were the songs of the so-called 'acoustic guitar singers'. The ban on \\"Camellia Lady\\" and others was lifted in 1987. However, this kind of 'nervous' censorship, which finds much of its breeding ground from past history, is still ongoing. Just as \\"Japanese-tinged\\" Trot songs were banished, so the anti-Japanese leftists in the 2010s insisted on having to replace the school songs composed by pro-Japan musicians. Ppongjjak debate In 1984 this dispute entered the national discourse in South Korea.Pak Gloria L (2006): \\"On the Mimetic Faculty: A Critical Study of the 1984 Ppongtchak Debate and Post- Colonial Mimesis\\", in: Korean Pop Music: Riding the Wave, edited by Keith Howard, pp. 62-71, Folkestone, Kent: Global Oriental.The course of debate is briefly summarized in the article (pp. 48-49) by Son Min-jung (October 2013): \\"Self and Others in the Studies of Korean Popular Music: a Case Study of T‚Äô≈≠rot‚Äô≈≠\\", The Journal of Aesthetics and Science of Art, Vol. 39 (1), pp. 41-68. PDF available. (in Korean) (ÏÜêÎØºÏ†ï: \\"ÎåÄÏ§ëÏùåÏïÖÏó∞Íµ¨Ïóê ÏûàÏñ¥ÏÑú Ï£ºÏ≤¥ÏôÄ ÌÉÄÏûêÏùò Ï†ïÏπòÌïô - Ìä∏Î°úÌä∏ Ïó∞Íµ¨Ïùò ÏÇ¨Î°ÄÎ•º Ï§ëÏã¨ÏúºÎ°ú\\", ÎØ∏ÌïôÏòàÏà†ÌïôÏó∞Íµ¨ 39Ïßë). The debate, initiated in a provocative article \\"Who does claim Ppongjjak as ours?\\" in 1984,A Korean classical musician Hwang Byeong-gi wrote the article \\"ÎàÑÍ∞Ä ÎΩïÏßùÏùÑ Ïö∞Î¶¨ Í≤ÉÏù¥Îùº ÌïòÎäîÍ∞Ä?\\" in the monthly music magazine The Eumak Dong-a (Korean: ÏùåÏïÖÎèôÏïÑ), 1984 (November). This magazine has stopped publishing in 1989. centered on whether or not Trot music originated from either Japanese or Korean music. Because the genre was borrowed from Japan during the colonial period of Korea, as well as incorporated Japanese song influences in Changga, the genre has been subject to questioning its Korean identity. This Korean identity question is subtly rooted in the argument that the Japanese cultural suppression policyAbout 'Japanese cultural suppression policy' see Mark E. Caprio (2009): \\"Japanese Assimilation Policies in Colonial Korea, 1910-1945\\", Seattle, University of Washington Press. led to Koreans uncritically accepting the popular music Trot influenced by enka. An anti-Japanese critics went so far as to tag Trot as oddments from Japanese colonial period.Bak Yong-gu (1984-11-29): \\"Ppongjjak is oddments of age\\", Hanguk Ilbo, (Î∞ïÏö©Íµ¨: \\"ÎΩïÏßùÏùÄ ÏãúÎåÄÏùò Ï∞åÍ∫ºÍ∏∞Ïù¥Îã§\\", ÌïúÍµ≠ÏùºÎ≥¥). This probably one-sided statement was answered by musicians and critics who saw things in a different way and responded; the claim on the part of Korean classical music that Trot is Japanese-tinged and thus such songs should be forbidden, is a useless judgement of the colonial victim mentality.Jo Un-pa (1984-12-13): \\"There are many contradictions when judging songs as forbidden\\", Hanguk Ilbo, (Ï°∞Ïö¥Ìåå: \\"Í∏àÏßÄÍ≥° ÌåêÏ†ï Î™®Ïàú ÎßéÎã§\\", ÌïúÍµ≠ÏùºÎ≥¥). The debate back and forth was held in the newspaper Hanguk Daily News from November to December 1984.In addition to the noted critics, Kim Ji-pyeong (ÍπÄÏßÄÌèâ), Park Chun-seok, Seo U-seok (ÏÑúÏö∞ÏÑù), Lee Geon-yong (Ïù¥Í±¥Ïö©) were also involved in the debate. Since no concrete evidence has arisen to validate either side, this debate still continues to exist when discussing the origins of Trot music. =1920s‚Äì1950: Formation= Before the 1920s, there was little information about popular Western music.Information about the songs not recorded in the 1910s see (in Korean) Korean Cultural Heritage Foundation. In the 1920s, some recordings with a vague resemblance to Trot were heard around Korea, but these were likely forms of Western popular music. To detail Trot music's beginnings, the following songs are presented as 'forerunners': Singer Yun Sim-deok () recorded \\"In Praise of Death\\" () 1926 by Japanese Nitto Records. It is often regarded as the first 'Yuhaengchangga'. Yun Sim-deok was a soprano. She had an affair with a married man, with whom she ran away and escaped: on a boat trip to Japan in 1927, she threw herself into the sea with the lover - there is a Korean film about this story. After her death, just such a story made the song widely known. The song was not originally composed, but Yun Sim-deok wrote lyrics and then transferred it to waltz melody of \\"Waves of the Danube\\" by Ion Ivanovici. The song itself actually contains few of the characteristics of Trot. \\"Pupil Song\\" (), first recorded in May 1921 and sung by Korean Christian youth group, became popular.Korean Records Archives (in Korean). This song belongs to marching songs. The melody of \\"Pupil song\\" was borrowed from \\"Railway Song\\" (ÈâÑÈÅìÂî±Ê≠å), which Japanese composer Oono Umekawa had composed in 1900.See :ja:Â§öÊ¢ÖÁ®ö Who wrote lyrics of \\"Pupil song\\" is unknown. Several singers, e.g. Chae Gyu-yeop (), Go Un-bong (), recorded this song. The song became popular because the encouraging mood, evoqued by a beat typical of marching songs, was appealing to those oppressed by Japanese rule. On the other hand, the Japanese \\"Railway Song\\" was later adapted to fit North Korean communist ideals, titled \\"Revolutionary Song Against Japan\\" () and \\"Rise Proletariat\\" ().Min Gyeong-chan (1998): \\"The Revolutionary Song of N.

A new contemporary music style, called manyo (), appeared in the 1930s. Its origins can be traced to Japanese mandan (Êº´Ë´á). This genre is characterised by satirical storytelling; hence its songs were also known as 'comic' songs. Some analyze the genesis and the circulation of this genre in the Japanese colonial era from a socially critical point of view. Whether this music actually had the educational function and had an effect on the catharsis of desire in society remains but open.Lee Eun-jin (December 2015): \\"Channelling Desires and Rebuilding Sensibilities Modern Desires of Japanese Colonial Era Represented in Comic Songs of the 1930s\\", Journal of Ewha Music Research Institute vol. 19 (3), pp. 1-37.

One of manyo's most popular songs was \\"My Older Brother Is A Busker\\" (), recorded in 1938 by Park Hyang-lim (). It is noteworthy that a manyo \\"Pleasant Old Man From The Country\\" (), recorded in 1936 by Gang Hong-sik (), was an adaption of George W. Johnson's \\"The Laughing Song\\" (1895). Later in 1970 \\"Pleasant Old Man From the Country\\" was remade as \\"Seoul Tour\\" () by comedian Seo Yeong-chun () and became a hit. In the period of colonial rule, pop culture in Korea was clearly influenced by Japan, and Western culture (primarily from Christian missionaries). Many musicians, such as Yun Sim-deok, Chae Gyu-yeop, and Park Hyang-lim, were educated in Japan or by institutions founded by missionaries. They imitated songs from Japan, or hymns and melodies from the West. In the 1920s there were few Korean composers who wrote original popular music. In the 1930s, Korean songwriters began composing original popular songs whose unhemitonic pentatonic scale were typical for Trot as well as for enka. Lee Aerisu () recorded \\"Traces Of Castle Ruins\\" () in 1931(released 1932),Korean Records Archives (in Korean). later remade under the title \\"Ìô©ÏÑ± ÏòõÌÑ∞\\" by many Trot singers. This song marked a milestone in Trot music. In 1931 the first countrywide competition for the new singers took place, in which Go Bok-su () was chosen and became one of the most prominent Trot singers: his debut song, \\"Away From Home\\" (Korean: ÌÉÄÌñ•, ÌÉÄÌñ•ÏÇ¥Ïù¥) became a hit. In 1933 Okeh records company was founded, which promoted the development of Trot and produced a lot of hit songs. :Hit Trot songs in the 1930s: * \\"Traces Of Castle Ruins\\" (Ìô©ÏÑ± ÏòõÌÑ∞, 1932) * \\"Living Away From Home\\" (ÌÉÄÌñ•ÏÇ¥Ïù¥, 1934) * \\"Tears Of Mokpo\\" (Î™©Ìè¨Ïùò ÎààÎ¨º, 1935) * \\"Serenade Of Sorrow\\" (Ïï†ÏàòÏùò ÏÜåÏïºÍ≥°, 1936) * \\"Tearful Tumen River\\" (ÎààÎ¨º Ï†ñÏùÄ ÎëêÎßåÍ∞ï, 1938) * \\"Don't Cry Hongdo\\" (ÌôçÎèÑÏïº Ïö∏ÏßÄ ÎßàÎùº, 1939) Before 1940, minor and pentatonic scales were predominant in Trot. Thereafter the major key was used more often. This did not occur in Japanese enka at the time, hence the development is considered peculiar to Trot. The simpler melodies of trot were enriched by it, gradually cheerful rhythms were created in the major key. But in the early 1940s, the country was overshadowed by the Pacific War. 5 years after the liberation from the Japanese colonial rule, the country suffered again under the Korean War in 1950. Nevertheless, several songs have been released during the 1940s (see below list). They are considered to be among the most significant examples, whose rhythms and moods profoundly influenced the development of the genre. So it is hardly possible to speak of Trot without these songs.The monumental trot songs and singers (2015-09-01), (in Korean) inquiry by the Korea Creative Content Agency, aired by KBS 'Gayomudae' (). :Hit Trot songs in the 1940s: * \\"Traveler's Sadness\\" (ÎÇòÍ∑∏ÎÑ§ ÏÑ§ÏõÄ, 1940) * \\"Wild Rose\\" (Ï∞îÎ†àÍΩÉ, 1942) * \\"Bindae-tteok Gentleman\\" (ÎπàÎåÄÎñ° Ïã†ÏÇ¨, 1943) * \\"Weeping Over The Hill Of Baktalchae\\" (Ïö∏Í≥† ÎÑòÎäî Î∞ïÎã¨Ïû¨, 1948) * \\"Moonlit Night Of Silla\\" (Ïã†ÎùºÏùò Îã¨Î∞§, 1949) * \\"Rainy Gomoryeong\\" (ÎπÑ ÎÇ¥Î¶¨Îäî Í≥†Î™®Î†π, 1949) =1950s: Diversification and the 8th US Army Clubs= After Japan's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula and the Korean War, few remnants were left of the music industry since survival remained many people's priority. Record companies, most of which were founded in the colonial era, began to struggle. Yet vinyl records were the primary way to distribute music to the population since radios were not easy to purchase in the '50s; according to estimates, about 350,000 radios were supplied nationwide in 1959.Lee Seong-min (July 2014): The Era of voice, a paper presented at the 'Conference Modern History from the view of broadcasting'.

National TV broadcasting began in 1956 and commercial TV broadcasting began in 1959.National Archive Newsletter: Summary of the broadcasts (in Korean). In 1957 US Army also built a transmitting station 'American Forces Korean Network' (AFKN). AFKN sometimes reached the largest US broadcaster abroad. In 2012 the previously independent AFKN was grouped under the 'AFN-Pacific Korea'.AFN via internet. An extensive study about the early AFKN see Jerry L. Priscaro (August 1962): \\"An Historical Study of the American Forces Korea Network and Its Broadcast Programming: 1957-1962\\", (Master's thesis, Boston University). Retrieved from PDF. It's fair to say that AFKN unconsciously played for almost half a century the role of the US culture mediator. In fact, many Koreans who were able to English had absorbed the western culture from this channel. Mass media was a way to spread songs, another way was records. Songs were released as singles or, sometimes, as EPs. LP record album production began in 1958. In the 1950s, two aspects should be emphasized. On the one hand, war and its effects had left its mark on Trot music; wartime was reflected in songs. These included: the ode to soldiers that was \\"A Serenade of the Front Line\\" (, 1952), stories of separations during the Hungnam evacuation told in \\"Be Strong Geum-sun\\" (), and the joy and sorrow of refugees in \\"Farewell Busan Station\\" () by Nam In-su (). The country's situation was reflected in the lamenting lyrics of \\"Spring Days Are Passing\\" () by Baek Seol-hee (), released in 1953. A family of abducted prisoners of war was a subject in \\"Heartbreaking Miari Hill\\" (). This song has been subsequently remade by many Trot singers. The Kim sisters with Dean Martin On the other hand, some tried to overcome the devastation war brought. But interestingly enough, Trot music, and modern Korean music as a whole was revitalised from cultural exchange in US Army clubs. These clubs were the linchpin for some entertainers.Detailed documentation and testimony of the 'US Army Shows' see two articles of Bak Seong-seo (in Korean). In 1954, the Eighth United States Army was moved from Japan to Korea, stationed in Seoul Yongsan Garrison.History of 8th United States Army. Musicians, promoted by United Service Organizations, visited the 8th US army base to give a morale-boosting concert. The visit of Marilyn Monroe in 1954 was the most sensational;Marilyn's performance (YouTube). Jane Russell in 1957Presidential Archives (Photo with President Syngman Rhee). and Nat King Cole in 1963Interview with Stars and Stripes (1963). visited. The US army also enjoyed Korean artists. Koreans thereafter called the US Army clubs 'the 8th US Army Stage' (). There were two types of these stages; one was housed in the garrisons - in addition to Yongsan Garrison, the Camp Market club in Bupyeong District was also very popular.About the details of US Army club see PDF of Bupyeong City Forum (in Korean). On the other hand, private clubs were opened around the garrisons, the so-called 'military camp town' (), e.g. in Dongducheon, Paju, Itaewon, where both soldiers and civilians could enter.Bae Sun-tak (February 2018): Popular Music in the 1950s, Pop Music SOUND No. 3 (in Korean). While working there, the musicians immediately became acquainted with American music culture and trends. They got to know different genres like blues, jazz, swing, tango, contemporary folk and country music, etc. As a result, fundamental changes of song titles, lyrics and rhythms in Korean popular music took place.Kim Yeong-ju (2002): \\"Character and development process of the Korean youth popular music culture: focusing on popular music since 1970\\", (Doctoral dissertation, Chungnam University), p. 69-70. Retrieved from RISS. (in Korean) (ÍπÄÏòÅÏ£º: \\"ÌïúÍµ≠ Ï≤≠ÎÖÑ ÎåÄÏ§ëÏùåÏïÖÎ¨∏ÌôîÏùò Ï†ÑÍ∞úÍ≥ºÏ†ïÍ≥º Í∑∏ ÌäπÏÑ±\\", Î∞ïÏÇ¨ÌïôÏúÑÎÖºÎ¨∏, Ï∂©ÎÇ®ÎåÄÌïôÍµê). They later played a leading role as contemporary influences on South Korean music. Important trot composers like Lee Bong-jo (), Kim Hee-gap (), Kim In-bae (), Park Chun-seok (), played instruments or worked as bandmasters in the 8th US army clubs. A lot of the famous rock bands and singers in the 60s and the 70s had their roots there. Some Trot singers who started their career there are: Choi Hee-jun (), Bae Ho, Han Myeong-suk (), Hyeon Mi, Cho Yong-pil. Female trio singers The Kim Sisters became popular during this time, as their performances drew appeal from American soldiers and audiences, catapulting them to fame when they performed on The Ed Sullivan Show during the 1960s.Photo Gallery of the 8th US army club in the 1950s, taken by then US soldier Jack Tobin; The Kim Sisters on the last photo. But the different genres have actually had little to do with the melodies of Trot. They were more of an inspiration to diversify and modernise. Only the name 'blues' in the titles had been widely used since the 1930s; this obviously came from Japanese examples.Jang Yu-jeong (2013): \\"Process and development of modern pop songs\\", in: Form for Korean Contemporary History, (KISS) p. 85.

It was not intended for the blues genre, but blues' retarding 4 strokes rhythm caught the songwriter's attention so that they called some songs 'xx Blues'. During this time, songwriters came up with songs by giving newfangled titles in English: e.g. \\"Shoeshine Boy\\" (, 1952), \\"Tango In The Night\\" (, 1953), \\"Evening Rain Blues\\" (, 1956), \\"Nilliri Mambo\\" (, 1957), '\\"Avec Youth\\" (, 1957), \\"Arizona Cowboy\\" (, 1959), \\"Daejeon Blues\\" (, 1959).Lee So-yeong (December 2007): \\"The Exoticism of Korean Popular Music in the 1950s\\", DBpia.

This ongoing disorder of society caused military coup d'√©tat in 1961. Despite this political turmoil, pop culture continued on its own path. Songwriters and singers who had picked up fresh ideas from US Army clubs and cultural exchange with Westerners, incorporated them into Trot. Modern sensibilities fused with those traditional to Korea in new songs. Han Myeong-suk released \\"Yellow Shirt Man\\" () in 1961, in a swing style. Its success swept across the country, so the singer from a nobody became a star. A few years later, a new Trot singer rose to fame. Lee Mi-ja recorded \\"Camellia Lady\\" () in 1964, the title song for the 1964 film of the same name. She recorded a lot of hit songs in the 1960s like \\"Yellow Robe Mast\\" (), \\"Cry Fever\\" (), \\"Heuksando Lady\\" (), \\"A Woman's Life\\" (), \\"A Father Goose\\" (). Through her numerous hit songs and over two thousand Trot songs she has released during her 60-year career, she is the singer of Trot par excellence. Well, the two songs evoque different images of people at the time. The image of the \\"Yellow Shirt Man\\" bursting with vitality was portrayed, but \\"Camellia Lady\\" was the traditional female figure in Korea who practices patience and fidelity in marriage.Jang Yu-jeong (August 2015): \\"Changes of Korean pop music from the perspective of the lyrics\\", in: Essays in celebration of the 70th anniversary of Liberation Day, p. 142. (in Korean) (Ïû•Ïú†Ï†ï: \\"Î∂àÎü¨Î≥¥Ïûê ‚ÄòÍ∑ÄÍµ≠ÏÑ†‚Äô, Ï∂§Ï∂∞Î≥¥Ïûê ‚ÄòÍ∞ïÎÇ®Ïä§ÌÉÄÏùº‚Äô: Í∞ÄÏÇ¨Î°ú Î≥∏ ÌïúÍµ≠ ÎåÄÏ§ëÍ∞ÄÏöîÏùò Î≥ÄÏ≤ú\\", in: Ïö∞Î¶¨Ïùò ÏÇ∂, Ïö∞Î¶¨ÎßêÏóê Îã¥Îã§, pp. 133-152). Kim In-bae (), at that time a trumpet player in US Army club, was one of the composers who aimed to update Trot music. Therefore, in composing he oriented more on contemporary American pop, which he was familiar with in US Army clubs, than the sensibilities and tone of conventional Trot. Kim's \\"The Old Familiar Faces\\" (, 1963) was in a waltz style, whilst Kim's \\"Red Shoes Lady\\" (, recorded by Nam Il-hae (, 1963) and another renewal-loving composer Son Seok-u's () \\"Yellow Shirt Man\\" had elements of swing music. The prominent Trot composer Park Chun-seok, who had debuted as a pianist in US Army Club, also wrote ballad-style music like \\"Early Rain\\" (, 1966) in addition to conventional Trot. This song and Choi Sook Ja's hit song \\"Forsythia Girl\\" ( and Patti Kim's hit songs, \\"Don't Forget You\\" (), \\"Love Went By Leaving Autumn Behind\\" (), \\"Does Anyone Know This Person?\\" (), all composed by Park, had semblances of what would become popular 'adult contemporary music'. Through these composers and others, Trot music became multifaceted, livelierm and more spirited. The two following individuals were among the most successful Trot singers in the '60s, known for their distinctive bass-baritone voices. Choi Hee-jun's talent was recognised by Son Seok-u, and he debuted with \\"A Pastoral Song\\" ().\\"A Pastoral Song\\" was composed by Son Seok-u ( Interview p. 35 PDF available) and later became known in the 1970s by Hong Min (). This song may belong to the genre contemporary folk music. Other relative hits had less of a conventional Trot sound and more of a classic pop sound, despite being in duple metre like most Trot. Examples include \\"My Lover Is Old Miss\\" (), \\"Barefooted Youth\\" (), \\"Student Boarder\\" (), \\"Palto-Gangsan\\" (). Bae Ho (),Bae Ho's biography (documented 2017) see Archives of Seoul Future Heritage PDF available (in Korean). then a drummer in Camp Market club, recorded his debut song \\"Arrow Of Love\\" () with tango rhythm. His early death at age 29 by nephritis and his songs made him a Trot legend. In 1967, he released two significant songs \\"Return to Samgakji\\" () and \\"Foggy Jangchungdan Park\\" (). The deeply vibrating soft voice was his trademark. After his death in 1971, many tried to imitate his singing style. It was suspected that several fake LPs, released under the name Bae Ho, should have been in circulation. Bae Ho and Nam In-su were the singers whose voice was often forged. By analyzing his voice, a few his LPs were actually identified as counterfeit.Digital collections of National Library of Korea (in Korean). Mean opinion score test with two mentioned songs has shown that Bae's voice moves between 100 and 300 Hz while singing. This is the frequency of a male average voice in a normal conversation. So it was explainable that his voice sounded so gentle while singing. In the 1960s, the government intervened in popular culture and banished such songs that it considered 'Japanese- tinged' or 'unsound' while promoting the 'sound' songs. Of course, composers still wrote sentimental songs, but even happy songs were actually increasingly popular. Kim Sang-hee () was one of the singers who mostly sang 'happy songs'. Examples of the 'happy songs' in the second half of the 1960s are: \\"Southern Village Over The Mountain\\" (), \\"Beanpole Mr. Kim\\" (), \\"Baldy Man\\" (), \\"Honey!\\" (), \\"Song Of Seoul\\" (), \\"Sergeant Kim From Vietnam\\" (), \\"Seosan Seaside Village\\" (). This included the traditional folk song. Kim Serena () was the star for Sin-minyo (i.e. new Korean folk song). It almost seemed like she was a Trot singer, but that was a unique phenomenon. Her hit songs: \\"Gapdori and Gapsuni\\" (), \\"Sae-Taryeong\\" (), \\"Seongju-Puli\\" (). The popularity of Sin-minyo lasted until the first half of the 1970s. During this time Kim Serena, Choi Jeong-ja, Kim Bu-ja and Ha Chun-hwa made Sin-minyo still popular. The young generation, born after the liberation of the Korean peninsula, now appeared on the Trot stage and later became leading Trot singers in the 1970s. Nam Jin () made his debut at the age of 20 with \\"Seoul Playboy\\" (), Na Hun-a () at the age of 17 with \\"Long Journey\\" (), Moon Joo-ran () at the age of 16 with \\"Song Of Dongsuk\\" (), Ha Chun-hwa as a child performer (6 years old) with \\"Filial Daughter Simcheong\\" (). These singers have since released many songs of Park Chun-seok, and earned the nickname 'Park's troop'. In this decade, several composers also made their name known, among others Lee Bong-jo, Gil Ok-yun, Shin Jung-hyeon, Jeong Min-seop, all later composed a significant number of works. =1970s: Heyday= South Korea became industrialised in the 1970s. As economic growth began, ordinary people became more and more interested in cultural life. Mass media such as radio and TV made Trot widespread across the country - the household ownership of televisions rose rapidly from 6.4% in 1971 to 83.1% in 1980,Chae Baek, Choi Chang-sik, Gang Seung-hwa, Heo Yun-cheol (December 2018ÎÖÑ): \\"Diffusion of television, wax and wane of community and family bond\\", Communication Theories Vol. 14 (4), pp. 146-147 DBPia.

That's one factor in the rise of Trot music in the 70s. The other was the young generation born around the time of liberation in 1945. Even though they debuted in the 60s they have since become Trot icons. Since 1966, Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation has hosted a popular variety show entitled 'MBC Ten Singers Match'; 5 singers each female and male are running in the team competition, and at the end of the show one of them will be chosen the best singer. The program was broadcast on the radio until 1968, then on television.eFilm History (show cut in 1970). It was renamed 'MBC Song Festival' in 2005 and is still held today at the end of the year.2018 MBC Song Festival. Whether the choice of some singers was always fair, is another matter.Donga News (2005-12-19) reported the canceled festival (in Korean). In the 70s, mainly Trot singers appeared in the show, but in the 80s, some ballad singers attended partially, and not until the 90s belonged Trot singers to the minority of participants. This can be meaningful evidence that showed the popularity of Trot in the 70s. A research sums up 59 songs that were presented in a weekly music program on TV as well as in the aforementioned festival in the 70s, also shows the same result.Jang Yu-jeong (February 2012): \\"The Characteristics of Korean popular song' lyrics in the 1970-1980s - focused on hit songs of public TV 1970-80\\", The Research of the Performance Art and Culture Vol. 24, pp. 79-113.

But Trot was no longer the only popular music genre in the 70s. With the proliferation of mass media, contemporary folk music from the United States slowly found its audience as well as performers, who led since the 80s one of the mainstreams of popular music in South Korea. From the late 1960s to the mid-'70s, two singers took Trot's stage: Nam Jin and Na Hun-a. They were indeed the first pop idols in South Korea. The rivalry of both was so awesome that predominantly female fans were clearly formed on two fronts.The detailed rivalry story of both singers see 6 articles of Bak Seong-seo (in Korean). Nam Jin was the first to hold his own concert in 1971 in Korean popular music history, which was then called 'recital' - actually a term for classical music rather than popular music. From the 80s, while Nam Jin could barely release hit songs like before, Na Hun-a released hit songs up to the 2000s, and his fans can still look forward to his sold-out concert in 2019.English Chosun Ilbo (2019-3-21): Na Hun-a proves enduring popularity as concerts sell out. The two have very different vocal styles. Nam Jin often sang in lilting mood. Some of his hit songs are rhythmically 'unorthodox' for Trot, e.g. \\"Darling, Please Don't Change\\" sounds like mimetic rock and roll. Na Hun-a, on the other hand, sang throughout in 'orthodox' style for Trot, often using the extended vibrato with wonderful Kkeokk-ki technique. Na's big advantage, of course, was that he was one of the few Trot singers-songwriters to write songs exactly according to his style. Their representative hit songs in the '60s‚Äì'70s are: :Hit Trot songs of Nam Jin * \\"Heartbreakingly\\" (Í∞ÄÏä¥ ÏïÑÌîÑÍ≤å, 1967) * \\"Because Mind Is Good\\" (ÎßàÏùåÏù¥ Í≥†ÏôÄÏïºÏßÄ, 1967) * \\"Love Me Once Again\\" (ÎØ∏ÏõåÎèÑ Îã§Ïãú ÌïúÎ≤à, 1968) * \\"With You\\" (ÎãòÍ≥º Ìï®Íªò, 1972) * \\"Darling, Please Don't Change\\" (Í∑∏ÎåÄÏó¨ Î≥ÄÏπò ÎßàÏò§, 1973) * \\"If I Had A Lover\\" (ÎÇòÏóêÍ≤å Ïï†Ïù∏Ïù¥ ÏûàÎã§Î©¥, 1973) :Hit Trot songs of Na Hun-a * \\"Love Is A Seed Of Tears\\" (ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùÄ ÎààÎ¨ºÏùò Ïî®Ïïó, 1968) * \\"I Wanna Live In Gangchon\\" (Í∞ïÏ¥åÏóê ÏÇ¥Í≥† Ïã∂ÎÑ§, 1969) * \\"Woman At The Beach\\" (Ìï¥Î≥ÄÏùò Ïó¨Ïù∏, 1971) * \\"Hometown Station\\" (Í≥†Ìñ•Ïó≠, 1972) * \\"Turning Waterwell\\" (Î¨ºÎ†àÎ∞©ÏïÑ ÎèÑÎäîÎç∞, 1973) * \\"Rusted Railroad\\" (ÎÖπÏä¨ÏùÄ Í∏∞Ï∞®Í∏∏, 1976) In the second half of the 1970s, some singers appeared who were not actually Trot familiar, but just with Trot songs were popular. Among them, Kim Hun was successful with \\"Leaving Me Behind, Arirang\\" (), Cho Yong-pil with \\"Come Back To Busan Harbor\\" (), Choi Heon with \\"Leaves Of Paulownia\\" (), Song Dae-gwan with \\"Suddenly, Sunny Day Comes\\" (), Yun Su-il with \\"But Never Want To Love\\" () and others. Most of them had previously engaged in rock band - at that time, such band was called 'group sounds', based on the Japanese model. Some critics sometimes refer to the music of these artists as 'Trot-go-go' or 'rocker's Ppong'. Called 'Trot-go-go' because go-go had primarily been introduced and popularized as dance music in the 1970s in Korea, and at the same time many so-called Go-go night dance clubs opened in Seoul, where the above-mentioned singers with their group sounds worked. Called 'rocker's Ppong' because group sounds as a rock band funnily enough performed Ppongjjak. After all, Trot-go-go has contributed to the enrichment of Trot by combining style, which is based on the traditional duple or quadruple metre scheme, with the syncopation elements of dance music. Cho Yong-pil's \\"Come Back To Busan Harbor\\" was noteworthy in that it suddenly made him a star from a hitherto unknown musician.The song was originally released by the late Kim Hae-il in 1969 with the title \\"Come Back To Chungmu Harbor\\". Cho's version was an adaption, released in 1972 without success and in 1975 with success. Later, the lyricist and composer Hwang Seon-u was reported for plagiarism of the lyrics of Kim Hae-il and fined in 2006 (ÏÑúÏö∏ÏÑúÎ∂ÄÏßÄÎ≤ï 2006. 3. 17). The popularity of this song could be explained by the political context, because the visit of the living in Japan Koreans who belonged to the pro North Korea association 'Jochongnyeon', just in 1975 was allowed:National Archives of Korea: Monthly review, September 1975 (in Korean). the brothers returned from abroad back to Busan - that's what the song screamed! In fact, the song itself became so popular later to make the Japanese enka singers aware of this song - several cover versions of enka singers are on YouTube.ÈáúÂ±±Ê∏Ø„Å∏Â∏∞ cover of enka singers (YouTube). Meanwhile, after the success of this song, Cho did not seriously himself concern with Trot music, but instead turned to his actual musical domain alternative rock and pop ballads.Interview with Hanguk Ilbo (2013-05-22, in Korean). Cho soon got into difficulty. In 1975, a 'marijuana scandal' occurred; 18 popular artists - mostly singers from group sounds including Cho and Shin Jung-hyeon - were rebuked for cannabis consumption and banished from public and private broadcastings several years.Drug-shadow over the entertainment business (Hanguk Ilbo, 2019-04-11, in Korean).

The young generation, called baby boomers in South Korea as well as in other countries, was coming of age. Baby boomer cohort, born between 1955 and 1963, is the largest population in South Korea.Bang Ha-nam (February 2011): \\"Who is the Baby Boomer?\\", in: Monthly Labor Review, Vol. 71, pp.5-9.

Accordingly, the number of students in colleges up to 1990 has increased dramatically more than seven times since 1970.The number of college students, including graduate students was 153,000 (1970), 437,000 (1980), 1,127,000 (1990), 1,894,000 (2000), 2,461,000 (2010).

The increased number of students boosted on the one hand the formation of student subculture, on the other hand the young generation faced the cultural cleavage between the desire for change and the conservative establishment and tried to adapt to the changing times. The popular music has also undergone this change and took up the challenge. Beginning at the end of the 70s, the young artists tried contemporary folk song and pop ballads and rock genre based on the taste of the Koreans. Music halls and night clubs offered singers with the acoustic guitar as well as group sounds to perform their works. Precisely by their subculture, even in outward appearances such as acoustic guitar, long hair, jeans and the like, they could feel differentiated from the elder generation.Kim Ji-seon (January 2011): \\"1970s Korean youth culture as cultural production layers\\", Research of Korean Studies Vol. 2, p. 172. PDF available (in Korean) (ÍπÄÏßÄÏÑ†: \\"Î¨∏Ìôî ÏÉùÏÇ∞Í≥ÑÏ∏µÎ°úÏÑúÏùò 1970ÎÖÑÎåÄ ÌïúÍµ≠ Ï≤≠ÎÖÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏóê ÎåÄÌïú Í≥†Ï∞∞\\", ÌïúÍµ≠ÌïôÏó∞Íµ¨ÎÖºÎ¨∏Ïßë, 2). It existed to provide newcomers the opportunity to meet and present their work. There were two prestigious song festivals that were hosted by MBC TV annually in the late 1970s, which now were not hold any more: 'College Song Festival' (1977-2012) and 'Riverside Song Festival' (1979-2001). In the 60s and 70s, the US Army clubs were the springboard from which many artists stepped forward. In the 80s, the song festivals assumed such role. Well, Trot had a hard time with this uplifting music of the baby boomers. Trot was able to hold its own still in the 80s. The popularity of cassettes proved very important for the genre, and helped bring about the localization of Trot music. It also helped in the invention of the sound of Trot medley, which is now emblematic of contemporary Korean Trot music. In 1984, a medley album \\"Couples-only Party\\" (), consisting of 21 well-known Trot songs was released. It was a compilation of separated recorded songs of a female and a male singer in alternating, but not in duet, and their voice was enhanced by acoustic echo. After the extraordinary success of the first album, they recorded 4 more \\"Couples-only Party\\" cassette albums next year also with success. The five \\"Couples-only Party\\" albums contain a total of 110 Trot songs. As a result, many musicians flooded the music business with about 50 albums titled 'Couples-only'.DongA Ilbo (1985-04-24) (in Korean). A few years later, another female singer Mun Hee-ok () succeeded also with a Trot medley album \\"Disco Medley In Eight Dialects\\" (). Anyway, the female singer Joo Hyun-mi was discovered - the male partner Kim Jun-gyu () was actually not a professional singer, but a composer and producer. Previously, Joo Hyun-mi had participated as a vocalist of a student band at the 'Riverside Song Festival' (1981) and won the participation prize.She tells in a KBS TV interview (2014-09-24) how the album was recorded and also about her career. The success of \\"Couples-only Party\\" made her debut with her own song \\"Rainy Yeongdong Bridge\\" () in 1985. This debut song brought her as Trot singer countrywide fame, Joo released four albums in 1985 as well as 1986 with moderate success. The 9th album \\"Sinsa-dong And The Man\\" () in 1988 earned her 'Song of the Year Award' of KBS and MBC, the most important awards at that time in South Korea. Her singing style of this song differed from the conventional Trot in that the tempo was rhythmically fast in diatonic scale: this may be influenced by the medely style. Critics call it a semi-Trot. The lyrics of her songs like \\"Sinsa-dong And The Man\\", \\"Tears Blues\\" (), \\"Unrequited Love\\" (), evoked a certain milieu of hostess clubs. A famous entertainment district in Seoul was Sinsa-dong, which was usually called 'Yeongdong' in the 1980s and today 'Gangnam District' in great order. It may have helped to call Trot 'Seongin-gayo', literally adult music. In the 80s, also two female singers, Kim Soo-hee and Sim Soo-bong enlived the sinking popularity of Trot music. The two began their music career in the US Army club: Kim sang as a vocalist of a band 'Black Cats' and Sim worked as a drummer of a band 'Nonstop'. They are both singers and songwriters. Sim Soo- bong debuted in 'College Song Festival' in 1978 with \\"The Man Back Then\\" (). It was very rare for a singer to participate in the college festival with a Trot song. Although she got no prize, the song became a big hit next year. Like the success of \\"Come Back To Busan Harbor\\", so also the hit peaking of \\"The Man Back Then\\" probably has to do with the political incident back then. The song as well as its singer drew special attention to themselves because Sim was present at the assassination of President Park in 1979. But she herself suffered from the psychic trauma.Interview with JungAng Ilbo (2010-12-01) (in Korean). Her next hit song was \\"Men are Ships, Women are Harbors\\" (). Otherwise, she brought little hit songs. Kim Soo-hee's career began in 1976 when she recorded her first album \\"Too Much\\" (). After the unsuccessful debut song, she appeared as a vocalist for a band in the US Army club. \\"A Yoke\\" (), \\"A Southbound Train\\" () and \\"Sad Love\\" () were breakthroughs in her career. \\"A Yoke\\" garnered above all sympathetic acceptance from those women who engaged in bars and clubs, because its lyric reflected images of their quotidian hardships and solace. The imagery of this song was similar to that in Joo Hyun-mi's songs \\"Rainy Yeongdong Bridge\\" and \\"Sinsa-dong And The Man\\". \\"A Southbound Train\\" was popular at the time especially as a fight song of the professional baseball team then Haitai Tigers, comparable to \\"Busan Seagulls\\" () of Lotte Giants - the Trot song \\"Busan Seagulls\\" was a one-hit wonder by Moon Seong-jae (). In addition, Kim Soo-hee considered \\"Sad Love\\" her favorite song.Interview with Monthly Chosun Magazine (October 2005) (in Korean). In 1985, a Trot music program 'Gayomudae' (), literally means 'music stage', launched by KBS TV. It accomplished a steady rapprochement to Trot's listeners till this day.Gayo-mudae Home page. =1990s: Decline in popularity= In the late 1990s, Epaksa made an extravagant attempt, calling his music 'techno-trot', a mixture of rapping, techno and dance. =2000s‚Äì2010s: Revival= Contemporary political use of Trot music An article published in the Chosun Ilbo in 2010 reported the government's use of Trot music as a propaganda tool against North Korea.The Chosunilbo. \\"Trot Music Is S.Korea's Best Propaganda Weapon\\".

Designed on a small, lightly armoured 4√ó4 chassis, it weighs an estimated 5.5 tonnes‚Äîmuch lighter than a tank‚Äîand is therefore more suited to rapid airborne deployments. Since 1959 AMLs have been marketed on up to five continents; several variants remained in continuous production for half a century. These have been operated by fifty-four national governments and other entities worldwide, seeing regular combat.Based on adding together all operators in the map and those listed below. The AML-245 was once regarded as one of the most heavily armed scout vehicles in service, fitted with a low velocity DEFA D921 90 mm (3.54 in) rifled cannon firing conventional high explosive and high explosive anti-tank shells, or a 60 mm (2.36 in) breech loading mortar with 53 rounds and dual 7.5mm MAS AA-52 NF-1 machine guns with 3,800 rounds, all mounted coaxially in the turret. An AML is capable of destroying targets at 1,500 meters with its D921 main gun. In this configuration it is considered a match for second-line and older main battle tanks. AMLs have appeared most prominently in Angola, Iraq, and Chad, as well as in the Lebanese Civil War between 1975 and 1990. History During World War II, the French Army and their Free French successors used a wide variety of vehicles for reconnaissance duties, ranging from the compact Laffly S15 to the Panhard 178, which could mount the same 75 mm armament as contemporary heavy tanks, and multi-wheeled designs such as the Type 201. After the war it became less desirable to maintain this plethora of armoured cars. In July 1945 Paris issued a requirement for a postwar design combining those features of previous assets ‚Äì especially the Type 201 ‚Äì that had shown potential both during and prior to the Battle of France. This led to the 8x8 Panhard EBR (Type 212) which entered service in 1950.Morse, Stan. Modern Light Tanks and Reconnaissance Vehicles. War Machine, 1983, Volume 2 Issue 19 p. 373‚Äì374. Similarly, in 1956 the French Ministry of Defense was persuaded to commission a replacement for the Daimler Ferret scout car. Also manufactured by Panhard, the successor was the AML (Type 245) which entered service in 1961. As with much postwar hardware based on the experience of subsequent colonial theatres, the AML was recognized for its outstanding ruggedness, dependability, firepower-to-weight ratio, and adaptability to the numerous minor conflicts waged since 1945. This reputation has led to export success in over forty countries, Africa being one of its biggest markets. =Development= An early AML-60. The Panhard AML was birthed as a private venture by the Soci√©t√© de Constructions Panhard et Levassor, a military subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citro√´n. It was derived in part from the Daimler Ferret, offering important similarities in external design. The first prototype appeared in 1959 and the vehicle was put into production in 1960, with more than 4,000 examples constructed by the time production ended. In the late 1950s, the French Army successfully operated a number of Ferret scout cars in Algeria. Impressive as they were from a conventional standpoint, the rest of France's existing light armour‚Äîsuch as the Panhard EBR and M8 Greyhound‚Äîwere not suitably equipped for counter-insurgency; battles of the Algerian War often involved short, sharp, skirmishes which required indirect fire support weapons such as mortars rather than solid shot and shell. In addition, the North African conditions demanded a lighter, less sophisticated, vehicle which would be simpler to maintain and operate. As an interim measure France had purchased two hundred Ferrets from the United Kingdom. These were light enough but carried only a single general- purpose machine gun, which was inadequate for offensive purposes. Nevertheless, they were sufficiently successful that there was a possibility of producing the Ferret under licence in France. However, Saviem, Berliet, and Panhard petitioned for bidding on a home-grown vehicle, and in 1956 the Minist√®re de la D√©fense issued specifications for an indigenous wheeled armoured car of similar dimensions and layout to the Ferret but mounting a breech-loading mortar. By 1959, this had emerged as the Auto Mitrailleuse L√©g√®re, designated Model 245 \\"B\\" by Panhard.Defence Update (International). Defence Update G.m.b.H., 1984, 1984‚Äì85 Volume Collected Issues 48‚Äì58. Early prototypes were completed in mid-1959 and by the end of 1961 at least one regiment in Algeria was receiving them. The AML was equipped with a 60mm Brandt gun-mortar and two medium MAS AA-52 NF-1 machine guns. Until Panhard's acquisition by Citro√´n later in the 1960s, it was manufactured at a single plant near the Porte de Choisy in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. The AML was immediately successful, but as the Algerian conflict diminished so did the need for a light mortar carrier deployed in anti-guerrilla operations. A more primary concern was the conventional threat posed by Soviet airborne fighting vehicles in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion. Meanwhile, South Africa, an AML customer which had considered adopting the British Alvis Saladin, also charged Panhard technicians to look into the development of an AML variant with equal or superior fire support capability. This and the adoption of a highly effective 90 mm rifled cannon led to all new AML-245 \\"C\\"s being refitted with the H-90 turret sporting the new gun. It fired fin-stabilised, shaped charge, projectiles boasting a muzzle velocity of 760 m/s and more than capable of penetrating 320 mm of rolled homogeneous armour. In consequence, the later AMLs could even engage main battle tanks. In addition to its high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shells the H-90 also carries fin-stabilised high- explosive (HE) projectiles, the total number of rounds stored being 20, compared with the 53 of the original 60 mm mortar version. To provide a complete family of wheeled armoured cars, Panhard used AML components to engineer a small personnel carrier, the V√©hicule Transport de Troupes, better known as the Panhard M3. The M3 consisted of a boxy, all-welded, hull with an engine relocated behind the driver in order to provide a large troop compartment at its rear. Its wheelbase was also increased from the AML's 2.5m to a higher 2.7m. and the track from 1.62 to 2.5m. In spite of this, maintenance alongside the AML fleet is rather simplified, given that both vehicles share a 95% interchangeability in automotive parts. The export success of the AML and M3 led directly to the development of the Panhard ERC 90 Sagaie and Panhard VCR, respectively, which were six-wheeled and could carry a wider range of heavy weapon systems. Mass production of the AML likely ceased at some point prior to the early 1980s. However, AMLs continued to be sold from French Army surplus stocks as late as 1999, when the final export orders were placed by Yemen and Tunisia. They were also marketed by a number of other second-hand suppliers, including South Africa, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. =Specifications= Fitted with coil spring suspension and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, the steering wheel requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion‚Äîwhile stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, eliminating the need for a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor.Automotive Industries. Philadelphia: Chilton Company, 1968, Volume 139 pp. 39‚Äî41. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual- circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft. An AML's crankshaft is carried in three ball bearings to reduce motor friction. Powerplant design was inspired by the Panhard EBR and incorporates an air-cooled 1.99 litre four cylinder engine developing 67 kW (90 hp). The Panhard engine was somewhat underpowered for the five to six tonne armoured car,Copley, Greogory. Defense & Foreign Affairs Strategic Policy journal. Alexandria: 1989. Vol.17, Collected Issues; pg. 37 and remained prone to mechanical failure in humid climates. Under temperate conditions it was capable of providing good operational service up to 26,000 kilometres before needing replacement.Pakistan Army Journal. Inspector General Training and Evaluation Branch, General Headquarters: Pakistani Army, 1986. Volume 27, Collected issues 1-3. AMLs may also be fitted with a variety of liquid-cooled engines, although as demonstrated by its Eland Mk7 counterpart this requires a costly reconstruction of the rear hull to accommodate the new cooling apparatus. AML hulls are assembled from only 13 welded pieces, with a driver seated at the front of the hull and the turret to his immediate rear. Above both doors the hull widens into a circular flange onto which the turret is bolted. This makes the turret basket extremely cramped, and little space is available above an AML-90's turret ring due to the massive gun breech and somewhat haphazard ammunition stowage. There are optical ring sights in front of both turret seats for quick laying of the main armament. AML turrets have a two-man crew, with the commander seated on the left and the gunner on the right. Depending on the variant, either may operate the roof-mounted searchlight. Seven periscopes are provided for the turret crew and three for the AML's driver. One of the three driving periscopes may be substituted with an infrared or image intensification periscope for night operations. On either side of the hull below the turret ring is an access door, one for the driver on the right and one intended for emergency purposes on the left. The left hull door, on which a spare wheel and tyre or fuel cans may be mounted, opens to the rear while the right hull door opens to the front. The engine housing at the rear of the hull is accessed through two access panels, and is insulated from the crew compartment by a removable bulkhead. Two sand channels resembling those on the Ferret are bolted to the hull front for crossing ditches and other obstacles. The AML uses nitrogen inner tubes (in this case Hutchinson V.P.-P.V.s) adopted from the EBR, providing run flat capability on 41 cm (16 in.)-diameter wheels; its 280 mm (11 in.) wide Michelin tyres can be deflated to reduce ground pressure to as low as . These have been replaced in some Anglophone armies by the Dunlop Trak Grips also favoured in Bedford and Alvis military vehicles. Service history =Europe= France Panhard AML-60, one of several which entered service with the French Mobile Gendarmerie. French military doctrine recognised two separate fields of armoured vehicle deployment, the first consisting of primary tasks such as manoeuvre and combat, while the second included other tasks such as rearguard defence, liaison, and deception. The latter was to be the responsibility of a mobile reserve which provided interior security during wartime ‚Äì designated D√©fense Op√©rationnelle du Territoire (DOT) armoured cavalry regiments. Initially equipped with AMLs and jeeps modified for scouting purposes, these units worked closely with the French police and National Gendarmerie. Their goal was to intercept hostile special forces or airborne units which specialised in deep penetration behind the front line. Secondary tasks included counter-insurgency, passive observation, and guarding static installations. Each DOT troop came to include three AML platoons. As they were expected to remain faithful to the traditional mission of reconnaissance where observation had priority over combat, a number of the AML-60s seem to have been stripped of their main armament, necessitating crew dependence on the vehicle's secondary automatic weapons. Nevertheless, to counter the mechanised threat posed by Soviet and other Warsaw Pact airborne forces, which often deployed with their own armour such as the ASU-57, BMD-1, and ASU-85, AML-90s were favoured as well. DOT regiments came to hold a generic pool of sixteen AML-90s and thirty-four other AMLs of varying configuration. As the AML was readily air transportable, it came to form the materiel strongpoint of the French Foreign Legion's rapid deployment force. The Legion AMLs saw combat overseas, either as part of single deployments by the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment or to provide fire support for other Legion regiments. Crews perfected unique airfield assaults in which AML-90s were unloaded directly from Transall C-160s onto the objective, with infantry joining them by parachute. They could also deploy from Breguet 941 and Nord Noratlas aircraft. These vehicles first saw combat against BTR-152s manned by FROLINAT rebels in Chad during Op√©ration Tacaud, successfully engaging an insurgent mechanised column approaching Salal around April 1978. On 18 May another sixteen AMLs, supported by a company of French infantry, routed FROLINAT elements advancing on Ati. In the subsequent months, additional AML-90s rushed in by the R√©giment d'infanterie-chars de marine (RICM) repelled a major offensive near Ab√©ch√© by the Chadian Democratic Revolutionary Council, which was backed by fifty Libyan T-55 tanks and EE-9 Cascavel armoured cars. Despite the intensity of these clashes, only three French AMLs were lost in Chad between 1978 and 1979, most likely to RPG-7s. The Foreign Legion's AML squadrons continued to see action during Operation Manta and the extended Op√©ration √âpervier, being organised into anti-tank support groups for three battalion-sized task forces. Their speed and mobility proved instrumental in destroying much heavier Libyan main battle tanks. However, the French crews could only make up for their inferiority in firepower by outflanking the tanks first or attacking from the rear, and by the mid 1980s the threat posed by large Libyan armoured formations was considered so severe a squadron of AMX-10RCs had to be deployed as well. A single RICM AML platoon was deployed to assist in the 1979 overthrow of the Central African Empire during Operation Caban, likely shifted from Marine contingents stationed in Chad or Gabon. The armoured cars were landed at the airport in concert with French paratroopers during a textbook airborne assault; however, the defending Central African troops surrendered without offering resistance. AMLs did not see action again until Operation √âpaulard I, when twenty AML-60s and AML-90s were deployed for infantry support purposes. As the French infantrymen lacked heavy weapons of their own, they remained dependent on the AMLs for suppressing hard targets; this persuaded the French Army of the need for infantry fighting vehicles in overseas operations. The AML-90s were later used by the RICM against the Rwandan Patriotic Front during the Rwandan Civil War. The Mobile Gendarmerie operated over a hundred AML-60s and AML-90s, which were allocated to nineteen separate squadrons.Senat Avis: Premiere Session Ordinaire de 1986‚Äì1987 (Tome V) The AML was superseded in service with the Mobile Gendarmerie by the VBC-90 at the end of the 1980s. The last AMLs were withdrawn from active service in the French Army in 1991, being superseded by the Panhard ERC and the AMX-10RC. France retained about three hundred of these AMLs in storage as part of its strategic reserve as late as 1995. A small number were also used to simulate OPFOR armoured vehicles at the Centre d'entra√Ænement aux actions en zone urbaine (CENZUB) until 2012, when they were finally decommissioned. Portugal Franco-Portuguese military relations experienced a significant improvement during the 1960s, with the establishment of a French strategic missile tracking site on Flores Island in the Azores. The Portuguese government was compensated with French arms, which it acquired under especially generous terms. Following the outbreak of the Portuguese Colonial War, Lisbon began ordering AML-60s for deployment to its three African territories: Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. The armoured cars were purchased on long-term credit, with the French government granting payment facilities ranging from ten to twenty years, at six per cent annual interest. About 50 AML-60s were delivered to the Portuguese Army between 1965 and 1968 to complement the ageing EBR already in service. They were circulated largely among reconnaissance platoons in Africa, which utilised them for convoy escort purposes. Severe maintenance problems were soon encountered in the corrosive tropical environment, compounded by excessive dust, which caused transmission and engine damage. Most AMLs stalled during their initial convoy support missions and had to be towed behind other vehicles.African Armed Forces Journal: Article \\"Eland Mk 7 Diesel: African Design\\". Military Publications (Pty) Ltd, Volume 1994, Collected Issues September to December 1994 p. 28. These issues were later rectified by the installation of custom Volkswagen air intakes. Around the early 1970s, all Portuguese AML-60s in Angola were retrofitted with liquid-cooled, four-cylinder General Motors engines and pressure plate clutches, giving them a resemblance to the Eland Mk7. The new engines were adopted because they were cheaper to replace and Portugal found it easier to source their associated parts. In 1974, a squadron of AML-60s seconded to the Portuguese Army's School of Cavalry at Santar√©m took part in the Carnation Revolution, which heralded the collapse of the country's ruling Estado Novo regime and its colonial empire. The following year, when Portugal withdrew from Angola under the terms of the Alvor Agreement, 5 AML-60s were abandoned in that country and subsequently taken into service by Angolan factions. About 36 of the remaining AMLs were redistributed to the Regimento de Cavalaria N.¬∫ 3 (3rd Cavalry Regiment) and Regimento de Cavalaria N.¬∫ 6 (6th Cavalry Regiment), while the others were held in reserve. The Portuguese government entered into negotiations with a local subsidiary of Opel in 1982 to upgrade its entire AML fleet with liquid-cooled engines and pressure plate clutches, exempting those which had already received similar modifications during their service in Angola. Opel upgraded one AML for evaluation purposes before the programme was abandoned. Another, more successful, project entailed the addition of Portuguese PRC-239 wireless radio sets and communications equipment. The AML-60s were retired from 1989 onwards and replaced by the V√©hicule Blind√© L√©ger. =Middle East= Plinthed Israeli AML-90 at Yad La- Shiryon. Flat margin (turret race) between an Egyptian T-54/55's turret and angled glacis, one of the few areas on the tank vulnerable to 90 mm HEAT munitions. Israel An order of 29 AML-90s placed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1960 marked the first sale of AMLs to a foreign power, ushered in a new era of French arms sales to Tel-Aviv, and helped cement Panhard's success on the export market. The IDF armoured cars had been received by the end of 1963 and were first displayed publicly on the eve of Yom Ha'atzmaut, 1966.The Israel Digest of Press and Events in Israel and the Middle East. The Israel Digest, 1966, Collected Issues Volumes 9‚Äì10. Israeli units were primarily impressed by their high mobility and ergonomic nature, which was deemed ideal for airborne operations. Nevertheless, the AML-90's envisaged deployment by new A√©rospatiale SA 321 Super Frelons also purchased from France did not materialise, as the helicopters could not handle its 5,500 kg combat weight. At least 9 AML-90s were in service with the 41st Reconnaissance Company of the Harel Brigade during the Six-Day War under a Major Amnon Eshkol, participating in the capture of Ramallah in June 1967.Nachum Baruchy: The Hare'l (10th) Armoured Brigade In The Six Day War. Ariel Publishing, Jerusalem. 2010 (In Hebrew). Baruchy States that the 10th Brigade had one company (9 vehicles) of Panhard AML's. The AMLs were initially posted at Mevaseret Zion following the fall of East Jerusalem. They were among the first IDF armour to cross into the West Bank during the conflict, probing for Jordanian resistance. Major roads had been blocked by tank barriers although these could be easily bypassed in nimbler armoured cars. The much more cumbersome Super Sherman and Centurion tanks tasked with leading the IDF's spearhead towards Tell el-Ful failed to reach their objective; most were forced to turn back in the face of difficult terrain. Joined by the surviving seven Shermans and eight M3 half-tracks, Major Eshkol's AML-90s later helped defeat a Jordanian counterattack with M48 Pattons. In the War of Attrition, Israeli AMLs faced Jordanian M48s again on the Damia Bridge during the Battle of Karameh. Originally tasked with screening the IDF Centurions as they crossed the bridge, the lightly armoured AML-90 was at a unique disadvantage when confronted by entrenched Pattons. Moreover, the Jordan River was in flood and vehicle crews were unable to exploit their manoeuvrability in the muddy farmland. Several AMLs were knocked out by tank fire or towed anti-tank guns. They were withdrawn from service not long afterwards. The Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict marked some of the highest armour-to-armour kill ratios achieved with the AML platform to date, including the destruction of at least 13 Egyptian and Jordanian tanks.Armed Forces. Contributions by the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies. Allan Limited and the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies., 1986. Especially notable were several T-54 kills credited to an AML-90 platoon in the Sinai Peninsula: as late as the 1980s, military scholars continued to maintain that the 90 mm DEFA cannon lacked the muzzle velocity to penetrate the thick steel hull of a T-54/55. More well-documented cases have since verified this was possible, though only with multiple shots or a direct hit on the turret rim near the driver's hatch. Israeli AML crews also sustained losses of their own during this engagement, and some AML-90s may have been captured intact by the Egyptian defenders.AML-90 V√©hicule blind√© l√©ger (Egypte) Saudi Arabia In 1964, the Royal Saudi Army issued a requirement for an armoured car proven in desert warfare and equipped with a large semi-automatic cannon.Records of Saudi Arabia, 1961‚Äì1965: 1965. Burdett, Anita (editor). British Foreign Office, 1997, Volume 6 p. 57. . Bids were accepted from three companies‚ÄîAlvis, Cadillac Gage, and Panhard‚Äîwhich offered the Saladin, V-100 Commando, and AML, respectively, but the debate over which of the three to adopt was hamstrung by political considerations early on. Saudi Arabia remained inhibited from seeking American assistance in devising suitable defence programmes by the criticism and hostility of other Arab states. Under these circumstances, only arms transactions with French or British firms could be entertained. Despite longstanding diplomatic contacts, the French presence in Riyadh was rather limited compared to that of the United Kingdom, and the latter was in a better position to provide long-term logistical support for armoured cars to the Saudi military. Alvis was initially awarded a contract for 83 Saladins with a ten-year option on spare parts. Final negotiations for the delivery of the Saladins were underway when Sultan bin Abdulaziz abruptly cancelled the purchase in favour of Panhard.Middle East Economic Digest (1968). Collard, Elizabeth, Volume 12 pp. 131‚Äî173. Saudi AML-90s and AML-60s donated to the Niger Armed Forces during Operation Desert Shield. The $95 million Panhard deal proved instrumental in breaking existing preconceptions that the Arabian arms market was well protected by the UK. Gaullist circles heralded it as a major business and political success. In an interview in Beirut, Sultan bin Abdulaziz merely asserted that AMLs were selected as part of King Faisal's policy to strengthen the army with a greater infusion of modern arms.Middle East Record (1968). Israel Universities Press, 1973, Volume 4 p. 684. Saudi Army officials had preferred the heavier Saladin and appreciated its worthiness in desert conditions, but conceded the AML-90 was much cheaper. Panhard undertook the order amid much protest by pro-Israel lobbyists in France, who urged restraint in shipping arms to Arab bloc states likely to use them against Tel-Aviv. The sale was also challenged as a violation of Charles de Gaulle's Middle Eastern embargo, although the French government insisted it did not classify armoured scout cars as the same \\"heavy war materiel\\" covered by sanctions. Saudi AML-90s of the 20th Armoured Brigade were blooded near Daraa during the Yom Kippur War, having been airlifted to assist its Syrian defenders in Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft loaned from Iran. The airlift was carried out on October 14, 1973; six Iranian C-130s were needed to convey the vehicles and about 2,000 motorised infantrymen from Saudi Arabia to Syria. AML crews were generally assigned to static guard duty, patrolling the Damascus-Daraa road and keeping lines of communications clear between the multinational Arab forces. At least one AML-90 was captured by the Golani Brigade, likely while attempting to reconnoiter an IDF position after dark. The captured vehicle was later displayed by Israeli officials to the international press as proof of direct Saudi military involvement in the Syrian war effort. On October 16, the 7th Brigade, 71st Tank Battalion of the IDF's 36th Armoured Division reported clashing with the Saudi armoured cars as they performed reconnaissance for Iraqi forces near Tel Antar. The Saudis quickly disengaged. At some point between this skirmish and the evening of October 17, all the Saudi AMLs‚Äîalmost a composite light armoured battalion‚Äîlaunched an unsuccessful attack on IDF positions at the village of Tel Merai. Thereafter the remaining armoured cars and their crews were integrated with the Jordanian 40th Armoured Brigade. On October 19, they participated in a joint offensive with that unit but were halted by accurate tank fire from the IDF's 17th Reserve Armour Brigade and forced to retreat. The Israelis claimed to have destroyed most of the Saudi AMLs at Tel Merai. Saudi accounts acknowledge the loss of only 4 AMLs; furthermore, the Saudis claimed to have knocked out 5 Israeli tanks and damaged 5 more. Saudi Arabia ordered between 200 and 220 AMLs from France in 1968, with deliveries completed by 1970. Some sources have claimed a second order was placed in 1978 for another 250. The Saudi Army has since retired much of its Panhard fleet and exported surplus stocks to various nations.Africa Analysis. Africa Analysis Collected Edition, 1996, 1995‚Äì96 Volume Collected Issues 238‚Äì262. During the Gulf War, an estimated 200 AML-90s were phased from service. Upon learning that the Senegalese units participating in Operation Desert Shield were also familiar with the Panhard type, General Khalid bin Sultan ordered a number retained for their use. The armoured cars were hurriedly serviced, then donated to Senegal. Large quantities were also accepted by Morocco and Niger. Lebanon AML-90 of the Lebanese Army in Beirut, 1982. At least 74 AML-90s were delivered to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) between 1970 and 1975, and saw considerable action in the Lebanese Civil War. As their crews often left them unguarded outside army compounds, several may have been stolen by LAF deserters on their way to join regional militias. Others vanished during the disintegration of individual battalions, and by 1981 Lebanon's fleet had dwindled to 52.African Defence Journal: Article \\"Panhard Armoured Cars and Reconnaissance Vehicles in Africa\\". The Journal Publishers, 1981 volume, Collected Issues 5‚Äì16 p. 58. The surviving AML squadrons remained plagued by chronic shortages of personnel; some crews even fought in their turrets without a trained commander and depended on inexperienced spotters outside the vehicles to guide their fire. This resulted in phenomenal inaccuracy. Following the Battle of the Hotels, Lebanese Front troops in the Port District of Beirut brought their Panhards into action for the first time in the civil war, engaging Charioteer tanks crewed by Amal and Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) militants. Having lost nearly all their heavy armour and tanks to the militias, the predominantly Christian remnants of the Lebanese Army appropriated three AML-90s and nine obsolete T17 Staghounds to stave off repeated assaults by LAA forces from the hotel district. Due to the armoured cars' heightened vulnerability to RPG-7s, their crews began using debris as makeshift barricades. Muslim fighters failed in attempting to destroy the AMLs with RPGs, as well as B-10 and M40 recoilless rifles, since the projectiles lacked a clear trajectory in the rubble. The AML-90s' immense firepower at close quarters soon resulted in great structural damage to portside Beirut; a number of fortified buildings were wrecked by 90 mm HE shells, and those struck by multiple HEAT volleys demolished on their foundations. With truck- mounted ZU-23-2s covering their advance, the AMLs advanced on Allenby Street, flattening all resistance, and took the waterfront. Although both the LAA and the leftist Lebanese National Movement hastily brought up Charioteers and M41 Walker Bulldog tanks, so much wreckage was blocking the streets they could not manoeuvre. It was impossible to shoot accurately through the debris, and tanks could only manage speculative fire to discourage the AMLs. In 1983, LAF tanks with AML-90s in support were sent to eliminate Amal militants then threatening elements of Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF) at the Lebanese University. Following the Siege of Beirut, the LAF again mobilised its AMLs to occupy positions vacated by withdrawing Israeli troops. An undisclosed number were upgraded to AML-90 Lynx standard, including laser rangefinders, and continued to see service as late as 2014 against Syrian militants.Lebanese army raids Bab al-Tabbaneh in second day of \\"security plan\\"Lebanon army expands operation in restive Tripoli =Militia use= Panhard AMLs were favoured by the Lebanese militias due to their flexibility, especially in urban combat situations which saw them deployed against heavier Syrian armour. A detailed analysis undertaken by the United States Army Research Laboratory in 1979 found the AML \\"operated effectively in Beirut\\" and noted that \\"the ease with which the Panhard is driven and repaired, and the absence of tracks, provide the mobility desirable in an urban environment.\\" Modifications to militia AMLs included replacement of the original Michelin tyres with an air-pocketed type more resistant to mortar shrapnel, as well as increased armour plate‚Äîfabricated after the appearance of Syrian tanks made it difficult ordering volunteers to man the lightly protected vehicles. Christian Phalangist militiamen deployed twelve AML-90s as assault guns during the Siege of Tel al-Zaatar, using their elevated 90 mm cannon to knock out second or third storey fortifications shielding Palestinian guerrillas. AML-90s of the Druze Progressive Socialist Party's (PSP) People's Liberation Army (PLA) militia also swung into action against five Staghounds of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces during a raid on Fayadiyeh barracks in mid-1976. The armoured cars were incompetently handled by the leftist forces, and later abandoned near Kahale with an AMX-13 due to mechanical problems. =UNIFIL= Irish UNIFIL AML-90. AMLs have been deployed in support of eight UN-affiliated peacekeeping missions since UNFICYP in 1964. In April 1978, AMLs of the Irish Army were deployed with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), where they saw considerable action against the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia. Ireland had originally purchased 16 AML-60s in 1964 for its large United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) contingent. The deterioration of the security situation there led to its purchase of another 16 AML-60s and 20 AML-90s, which had been initially rejected due to their expense but were now deemed necessary for their significant offensive capabilities. A reconnaissance company consisting of at least 4 UNFICYP AML-90s and 14 Panhard M3s were subsequently shipped from Cyprus to Lebanon alongside the 43rd Irish Battalion, which joined the newly formed UNIFIL. As the most heavily armed of the national UNIFIL contingents, the Irish AMLs frequently functioned as a mobile force reserve. They were also used for manning checkpoints between the belligerent SLA and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) positions. By 1980 at least one AML had been damaged by a PLO RPG-7 aimed at the SLA lines. The armoured car caught fire, though all three crew members survived. On August 12, 1980 SLA militiamen attacked an Irish UNIFIL checkpoint at the village of At Tiri in southern Lebanon, having been antagonised by a statement made by Brian Lenihan Snr, Ireland's minister for foreign affairs, which they perceived as supportive of the PLO. One peacekeeper was mortally wounded, nine others taken prisoner, and the checkpoint overrun. The SLA then deployed four M9 Half-tracks equipped with Browning HB heavy machine guns, which they used to harass UNIFIL convoys. Two days later, Irish AML-90s counterattacked and retook the village. One half-track was immobilised, and a second destroyed after receiving a direct hit from a 90 mm shell. A third was abandoned when its Browning was disabled by warning fire from an AML's coaxial machine gun. The armoured cars also held a tense standoff with SLA M50 \\"Super\\" Sherman tanks on the outskirts of At Tiri, although the latter ultimately declined to intervene in the fighting and were not engaged by Irish forces. They withdrew upon the arrival of Dutch UNIFIL reinforcements armed with BGM-71 TOW missiles. At least one AML-90 crew commander was awarded Ireland's highest military honour, the Military Medal for Gallantry, for actions during the At Tiri engagement. Irish AMLs may have seen action again in 1996 during Operation Grapes of Wrath. Yemen In 1974, North Yemeni political leader Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar traveled to Saudi Arabia to negotiate the transfer of arms to the fledgling Yemen Arab Republic, which was rebuilding its armed forces after a recent civil war. The Royal Saudi Army agreed to donate 31 AML-90s from its own stocks, as well as provide the necessary instructors for training Yemeni crews. When Ali Abdullah Saleh became president of North Yemen in the late 1970s, the AML-90s were transferred to various paramilitary units in Sana'a and repurposed as internal security vehicles. Upon Yemeni unification, they were adopted into the integrated Republic of Yemen Armed Forces. Yemen purchased another 15 AML-90s and AML-60s from France in 1998. In the early 2000s, Yemen's army and security forces possessed a fleet of 125 AML-90s and 60 AMLs of other variants, most of which had been acquired from undisclosed sources. Due to attrition and age, the fleet dwindled to 95 by 2013. In 2014, the Yemeni army stripped a number of AML-90s of their turrets and refitted them to its BTR-60PB armoured personnel carriers, suggesting the former were finally nearing the end of their service life. Some AMLs have continued to see service in the ongoing Yemeni Civil War. Iraq During the mid 1960s, France was investigating new sources for cheap, good quality crude oil in the Middle East and began cultivating strategic partnerships with both Iraq and Iran accordingly. The establishment of strong bilateral ties between the French and Iraqi governments in 1967 coincided with several oil concessions being granted to a French firm, Elf Aquitaine, and an Iraqi military programme to acquire new Western arms in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. A delegation from the Iraqi Armed Forces first visited Paris around December 1967, and was followed by a second led personally by General Abdul Rahman Arif in February 1968. The Iraqis apparently placed orders for 75 AML armoured cars during both visits. Both orders resulted in a total of 106 AML-60s and 40 AML-90s being acquired by Iraq. These sales were perceived by the French government as a practical manifestation of its new Middle Eastern policies and an opportunity for cultivating more interest in new oil and other commercial deals France hoped to sign with Iraq. The decision to transfer AMLs to Iraq was, much like the similar sale to Saudi Arabia, vilified by the French domestic press as a violation of a voluntary arms embargo imposed on the Middle East. In both cases, the French government maintained that the embargo excluded only arms with \\"clear offensive characteristics\\", such as tanks or fighter aircraft. Following the July 17 Revolution, the Ba'ath Party assumed power in Iraq and turned to the Soviet Union as its principal supplier of arms. Between 1968 and 1970 the Iraqi Army underwent a second major rearmament programme with Soviet assistance. However, the Soviet government used this relationship to exert political pressure on the Ba'athist regime. Iraqi officials also believed the Soviets were withholding their most sophisticated weapons from export and therefore embarked on a diversification effort to find secondary suppliers of arms, preferably in the West. In 1972 the Ba'ath Party repaid France for not opposing its nationalisation of Iraqi oil by placing an order for some AML-90s. Estimates of the number initially sold and delivered to Iraq vary from 8 to 38; however, it is clear that this largely symbolic purchase was instrumental in re-igniting defence ties with France. In 1974 the Iraqis placed a second order for another 20 AML-60s and 42 AML-90s, and subsequently for 2 AML-60s and 25 AML-90s. Most of the orders were small and timed to coincide with Iraqi requests for access to far more advanced French defence technology, but they rapidly accumulated; Panhard recorded the sale of 131 AML-60s and 101 AML-90s to Iraq between 1972 and 1980. Operation Desert Storm. In Iraqi service, AML platoons were typically attached at the brigade or battalion level and utilised for their traditional role of reconnaissance. A single Iraqi armoured reconnaissance platoon may have consisted of up to 8 AMLs.Armies & Weapons. Interconair, 1977, Volume Collected Issues 31-39, pp. 48-54. Each Iraqi Army corps and infantry division also had its own reconnaissance battalion with 46 AMLs and BRDM-2 scout cars divided into two companies. Most conventional reconnaissance duties were carried out by the AML-90s, which were valued for the size and range of their armament, while the AML-60s were relegated to secondary battlefield tasks. Iraqi AMLs first saw action in Khuzestan Province during the 1980 invasion of Iran. Lacking adequate air cover, a number were destroyed by Iranian Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters on September 28 near Bostan. In 1991, AML-90s were deployed again, somewhat ineffectually, against United States Marine Corps and Saudi National Guard troops during the Battle of Khafji. Their appearance at Khafji may have led to some initial confusion, since the armoured cars were also operated by the Saudis. Many Iraqi crews failed to take advantage of their vehicles' mobility and engaged the coalition forces from static positions until they were wiped out by artillery. During the Liberation of Kuwait and the subsequent coalition counter-offensive, air superiority was the deciding factor in most reconnaissance operations. The US made use of scout helicopters armed with BGM-71 TOW missiles, which frequently obliterated Iraqi AMLs at long range before they could observe or harass allied ground forces. Others were destroyed on the ground during the first day of the coalition thrust into Kuwait, namely by US M1 Abrams tanks. The US estimated that the Iraqi Army was operating 300 AMLs in 1990. Iraq lost about half its armoured reconnaissance vehicles during the Gulf War. A small number of AML-90s and AML-60s remained in service, although they were increasingly threatened by erratic maintenance and lack of spare parts. When a US-led coalition invaded Iraq in 2003, Iraqi AMLs clashed with a contingent of American tanks attached to 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines as they advanced on Nasiriyah. Egypt Egypt first encountered Israeli AML-90s in the Sinai Peninsula during the Six-Day War, where at least one platoon was deployed against Egyptian T-54 tanks on several occasions. Some were captured by the defending Egyptian forces during the Israeli campaign, with individual examples being pressed into service. Their performance sufficiently impressed the Egyptian Army that it later issued its own requirement for an armoured car with a turret-mounted 90 mm gun, preferably firing discarding sabot projectiles for improved anti-tank purposes.For Your Eyes Only: an Open Intelligence Summary of Current Military Affairs. Tiger Publications (Amarillo, Texas), 1982, Volume Collected Issues 34-53. Bids were accepted from six European contractors (including Panhard), for the programme, although it is unclear what vehicle was adopted. =South America= Captured Argentine AML-90 on display at Bovington Tank Museum In the Falklands War, the Argentines deployed 12 AML-90s from Escuadron de Exploracion Caballeria Blindada 181 (181st Armoured Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron) and an unknown additional number from Escuadron de Exploracion Caballeria Blindada 10 near Port Stanley. During the Battle of Wireless Ridge the only armour versus armour engagement of the war was fought when these units encountered FV101 Scorpions and FV107 Scimitars of the Blues and Royals. The armoured cars were abandoned in Stanley after the conflict ended. In the Salvadoran Civil War, at least one AML-90 was destroyed by FMLN insurgents with rifle grenades and an M67 recoilless rifle. =Sub-Saharan Africa= In 1987, during the Toyota War, FANT's use of swift wheeled vehicles, including AML-90s, allowed Chadian forces to break through combined arms formations and cause severe damage before the slower Libyan tanks could track or engage their targets. The Panhards, deployed in concert with MILAN missile teams at strategic hill junctures, frequently ambushed T-55s at a range of under three hundred metres. In mid-December 2010, AMLs manned by Laurent Gbagbo's supporters were used to intimidate Ivorian civilians in Abidjan and the western countryside.http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1097345.pdf The Ecole de Formation et d'Application des Troupes Blind√©es, at Mbanza-Ngungu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was originally established by French Military Cooperation Mission to instruct African AML crews. Today, the academy can host 70 trainees; ten African armies are currently participating in the program. Variants AML variants on a U.S. military recognition plate. From right to left: AML-90 (H-90), AML-20 (H-20), and AML-60 (HE 60-7). =AML-60= Known more formally as the AML HE 60-7, or by its manufacturer's code AML-245B, the AML-60 was Panhard's initial production model and included a rounded turret with twin 7.62mm machine guns on the left and a breech-loaded 60 mm (2.36 in.) mortar on the right, with 3,800 stored rounds of 7.62mm ammunition and 43 to 53 mortar projectiles, respectively. The mortar can still be muzzle loaded from outside the vehicle, but is unique in its opening breech locked by a falling block much like direct fire artillery. It has an elevation of +80¬∞ and a depression of ‚àí15¬∞. Two types of mortars are available: a Hotckiss-Brandt CM60A1 or, in later production models, a Cloche Sp√©ciale (CS) 60 designed by the French government's Direction technique des armements terrestres (DTAT), which was distinguished by its ribbed barrel. The ergonomic dimensions of the CS 60's ammunition allow ten more mortar bombs to carried for a total of 53, as opposed to the CM60A1's 43. Both can be fired on a flat trajectory and are effective at no more than in the direct role, or in the indirect role. Separate combat and command variants of the AML HE 60-7 turrets were manufactured, the latter being fitted with additional radio equipment and therefore possessing comparatively limited stowage. The number of stored ammunition is reduced to 32 mortar bombs and 3,200 7.62mm rounds, respectively. An AML-60's crew commander acquires targets, directs the gunner, and makes a series of ranging and ordnance calculations to ascertain firing angles. Sighting is optical, and carried out through an M112/3 combined monocular telescope and binocular periscope. Elevation aiming control is linked to the mortar but provision made for manual scanning. In late production models, the micrometre markings on the sights could be illuminated for night firing. =AML 60-20= Known as the AML HE 60-20, the AML 60-20 replaced both co-axial 7.62mm machine guns with an M621 20 mm autocannon with 500 stored rounds. The 20 mm autocannon was based on the MG 151 and has an elevation of +50¬∞ and a depression of ‚àí8¬∞, allowing it to engage low-flying aircraft as necessary. It fires both armour-piercing and high-explosive rounds with a muzzle velocity of . An optional 7.62mm pintle-mounted machine gun can be mounted on the turret roof as necessary, although only 1,000 rounds of ammunition may be stored. =AML 60-20 Serval= Panhard AML 60-20 Serval of the Niger Armed Forces on parade. Note the lack of any co-axial armament on the turret face. The AML-60-20 Serval mated an AML-60 chassis to the much larger and more sophisticated Serval turret designed by Hispano-Suiza CNMP, with considerable improvements to the firepower, sights, and ammunition stowage of the original AML 60-20 concept. Two types of 20 mm autocannon were offered: the M693, or the Oerlikon KAD B-16 (Hispano-Suiza HS.820). The original CS DTAT or CM60A1 mortars were replaced by the long-barelled Brandt 60 mm LR gun-mortar, which more than doubled the range of the main armament. The Brandt LR also fired a unique armour-piercing projectile. Due to interior space taken up by the larger mortar, the autocannon and a 7.62mm machine gun were shifted to a new position at the rear of the turret. AML 60-20 Servals were the first AML-60 variants to be fitted with an electrical fire control system developed specifically for gun-mortars. The apparatus consisted of two separate control units, one for the gunner and commander, and a new rangefinder. It also included an inclinometer and was designed to allow the main armament to be fired while the AML was parked on sloping ground, without compromising accuracy. A gunner could make the appropriate corrections to bearing aim, based on the altitude according to the horizontal. =AML 60-12= AML 60-12 in Iraq, late 1970s. Known as the AML HE 60-12, the AML 60-12 was identical in every manner to the AML 60-20 but replaced the 20 mm autocannon with a single 12.7mm heavy machine gun. Its turret had an ammunition capacity of 1,300 rounds of 12.7mm and 3,800 rounds of 7.62mm. =AML-90= Formally known as the AML H-90, or by its manufacturer's code AML-245C, the AML-90 was designed for carrying out rearguard duties and substituting for the heavier tanks and armoured fighting vehicles deployed in a more linear fashion at the front. Its major feature was its DEFA low- pressure 90 mm rifled gun, which permitted the anti-tank and reconnaissance elements of French territorial units to be combined into a new component capable of knocking out the heaviest vehicle likely to be ranged against it, the Soviet ASU-57 and ASU-85. This was a direct response to Soviet airborne doctrine‚ÄîMoscow's tacticians then attached great significance to the deployment of paratroopers, with their own artillery and armour, deep behind enemy lines. The DEFA D921 was the first 90 mm low-pressure gun to be mass- produced in France. It was specifically designed for vehicles weighing under ten tonnes in mind, and the successful mating of such a large calibre weapon on the five tonne AML chassis was then considered a major engineering achievement. This made an AML-90 exceptionally well-armed in proportion to its weight, and offered the advantage of easier recoil loads over conventional tank cannon. The weapon was developed by the Etablissement d'Etudes et de Fabrications d'Armement de Bourges (EFAB) in the 1950s and partly modelled after the Mecar series of lightweight 90 mm KEnerga guns from Belgium. Unlike the Belgian guns however, the DEFA D921 lacked a smoothbore barrel, instead utilising shallow rifling with a rather slow twist to impart a low rate of spin to the discharging projectile. Its ammunition was also fin-stabilised, but improved on the Mecar ammunition by incorporating the fins as a direct extension of the individual shell, making it much shorter. As mounted on the AML-90, the D921 has an elevation of +15¬∞ and a depression of ‚àí8¬∞. It is provided with a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun to the left of the main armament. The turret is traversed by rotating the gunner's handwheels, which are not power assisted. Cranking the turret through a full 360¬∞ takes approximately twenty-five seconds. A total of 20 90 mm shells and 2,400 rounds of machine gun ammunition are carried. The 90 mm high-explosive anti-tank round possesses a muzzle velocity of and will penetrate of armour at an incidence of 0¬∞, or of armour at 60¬∞. The high-explosive round has a muzzle velocity of . These rather low velocity performances, although suitable for close combat, make hit probability poor at extended ranges and proved to be a serious handicap when fighting tanks. Combat experience during the South African Border War and the Six-Day War proved that the AML was decisively outranged by both the T-34/85 and the M48 Patton, respectively. Its rather austere fire control, with optical ranging based on the crew commander's estimates, was also problematic. The vehicle is unable to fire on the move, since its transmission cannot absorb the recoil of such a large gun while in forward motion and suffers excessive wear as a result.South African Journal for Contemporary History, Volume 31. Sun Media (Bloemfontein), 2006. pp. 361‚Äì362. Nevertheless, during at least three conflicts the AML proved capable of knocking out main battle tanks, often by attacking from the flank or rear.Heitman, Helmoed-R√∂mer. South African Arms and Armour ‚Äì A concise guide to armaments of the South African Army, Navy, and Air Force. Struik Publishers 1988. p 44‚Äì45. The heaviest armour destroyed by an AML-90 was likely a Libyan T-62 during the Toyota War, in March 1988. The D921 recoils approximately 58 cm and is then returned to the firing position by a hydropneumatic recuperator. It is fitted with a double-baffle muzzle brake which reduces the magnitude of the firing impulses and consequently, the average recoil forces. However, the deflection of propellant gases rearward and the resulting overpressure may cause whiplash to the crew. During runout the breech is opened and an empty shell casing ejected; the breech then remains open for reloading. =AML-90 Lynx= Bottom: Original H-90 turret. Top: Lynx 90 turret incorporating a new commander's cupola, sights, searchlight, and a laser rangefinder. Also known as the AML D-90 Lynx, the AML-90 Lynx was a heavily upgraded and modernised AML-90 fitted with a sophisticated turret and ranging system. Like the H-90, the D-90 Lynx turret mounted the same D921 90 mm gun on the right and a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun on the left. The main armament now had an improved elevation gear and could be elevated from ‚àí8¬∞ to +35¬∞.African Defence Journal, Issues 113‚Äì124. The Journal, 1990, Collected Issues 113‚Äì124. pp. 112‚Äì113. Other modifications included the replacement of the unlit optical sights with TJN2-90 combined day/night sights. The new sights were designed around a light intensifier tube with automatic gain control to enable sighting in the darkness without the need for artificial illumination, and had a range of nearly . They could be fitted with additional features such as slope compensation or tachometry facilities. A menagerie of other sights and sighting equipment were also offered with the AML-90 Lynx for export customers, including the same CANASTA night sights package and electronics suite as fitted to the AMX-10RC.African Defence Journal, Issues 5‚Äì16. The Journal, 1981, Collected Issues 5‚Äì16. pp. 54‚Äì59. The CANASTA system included a low-light television camera and display units for the AML's gunner and commander, along with a moving electronic reticle with sight angle corrections. This somewhat compensated for low hit probability from the first 90 mm round at long range, allowing for the automatic engagement of moving targets. One of the defining characteristics of the AML-90 Lynx was the large searchlight mounted co-axially with its 90 mm gun, a domed commander's cupola with vision blocks reminiscent of the Eland Mk7, and a boxlike laser rangefinder on the gun mantlet. Two types of French laser rangefinders were available as standard, although several foreign designs such as the Avimo LV3 could also be fitted: the TCV 107 and the TCV 29. Both rangefinders automatically calculate the range to target and feed this information to the crew commander, eliminating the need for rough estimation as before. AML-90 Lynxes were offered with a variety of new power plants, namely a Peugeot XD 3T diesel engine developing 71 kW (95 hp) for an extended range of . In 1979, one AML-90 Lynx prototype was showcased with a Mercedes-Benz OM617 developing 86 kW (115 hp) but it remains unclear if this model entered production. The armament as fitted to the D-90 Lynx turret could be also configured greatly, including the modification of the D921 gun to fire APFSDS ammunition with a muzzle velocity of , or its replacement with the considerably more powerful Cockerill Mk. III medium pressure 90 mm gun as mounted on the EE-9 Cascavel. Many of these turrets were equipped with hydraulic traverse, eliminating the necessity for manual operation. Traversing a powered Lynx turret through a full 360¬∞ takes less than fifteen seconds. The first export sales of the AML-90 Lynx were to Burundi, which ordered 12 in 1982. Morocco purchased 20 in 1988, and another 23 were accepted by the Chadian National Armed Forces (FANT) as military aid during the final stage of the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict.African Defence Journal, Issues 78‚Äì88.

An undisclosed number of Lebanese and Kenyan AML-90s have been upgraded with Lynx turrets as well.How war boosts Kenya's regional, global clout =AML S530= Designed as a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon, the AML S530 was developed solely for export and is operated by the Venezuelan Army. It carries twin M621 20 mm autocannon, with 600 stored rounds. The autocannons have an elevation of +70¬∞ and a depression of ‚àí10¬∞. Ranging is optical and carried out by a roof-mounted periscopic sight very similar to that installed on the AML HE 60-7. The sight has been modified for anti-aircraft purposes and has a vertical field of view of 20¬∞. It has a sun filter, a collimator with an adjustable illumination feature for night firing, an adjustable display lead for tracking fast or slow moving targets and aircraft either flying horizontally or diving, and automatic fire range estimation effective up to . More specialised anti- aircraft sights, as well as sights designed solely for engaging ground targets, could also be installed when necessary. Both 20 mm guns are equipped with an ammunition feed mechanism storing 260 rounds each. They can fired either on semi-automatic, fully automatic, or in short bursts, with a cyclic rate of fire of 750 rounds per minute per barrel. One barrel may also be selected at a time. The ammunition feed is housed in the turret's elevating module, and fed from an ammunition bin in the turret basket. The 20 mm armour- piercing round possesses a muzzle velocity of 1,000 m/s and will penetrate 23 mm of armour at an incidence of 0¬∞. The high explosive and incendiary rounds have a muzzle velocity of . An AML S530 prototype was first showcased at Satory in 1971 and twelve were immediately ordered by Venezuela. They were produced and delivered by 1973, but no further export sales followed. A smaller, more rounded variant of the same S530 turret with improved sights was later mounted on an ERC 90 Sagaie chassis for a Gabonese military requirement. =AML-20= GI-2. The AML H-20 had a turret with full power traverse and elevation and was armed with a single 20 mm M693 F2 autocannon; a 7.62mm machine gun was also mounted co-axially with the main armament and a similar weapon could be fitted to the turret roof for anti-aircraft defence. The M693 could be elevated from ‚àí8¬∞ to +50¬∞. Unlike the M621 mounted on the AML 60-20 and AML S530, this weapon employed cartridges with mechanical priming and was paired to a dual-feed ammunition supply system, allowing more than one type of ammunition to be loaded at once, with gunners being able to switch between the two. It can fire all Hispano-Suiza HS.820 20 mm rounds as well as a specially developed French Type 693 sub-calibre armour-piercing round. The armour- piercing ammunition will kill any other light armoured car at ranges of up to , and also damage the sides of an older main battle tank. Like the M621 single shots, limited bursts, or continuous bursts can be fired. Two separate turrets were offered for the AML-20: the French TL-120 SO by the Societe d'Applications des Machines Motrices (SAMM), and the South African LCT-20 by Denel Land Systems, which was originally designed for the Ratel-20 infantry fighting vehicle. The TL-120 SO turret was open-topped and 1,000 rounds of 20 mm ammunition were carried. It was one of the most well-protected turrets fitted to the AML chassis to date, with a maximum armour plate thickness of 20 mm. This turret was also hydraulically powered and could be rotated through a full 360¬∞ in ten seconds or less. The gunner's optical sights were adopted from the AML S530 and a secondary periscope optimised specifically for anti- aircraft purposes also fitted. No sights were provided for the crew commander, leaving the gunner responsible for acquiring targets. The LCT-20 turret was considerably more sophisticated, incorporating a range of night vision equipment and a laser rangefinder. About 300 rounds of 20 mm and 1,000 rounds of ready use 7.62mm ammunition were carried. The LCT-20 was not open-topped, although for observation purposes there was a domed cupola with four direct observation windows. Denel sights provided for both the gunner and commander were effective up to . =AML-30= A prototype trialled during early 1970s, the AML H-30 mated an AML-90 chassis and turret to a single 30 mm Hispano- Suiza HS.831 anti-aircraft gun and was the first AML to be offered with powered turret controls. The 30 mm cannon could be fired on semiautomatic, in bursts, or fully automatic. A co-axial 7.62mm machine gun could be mounted to the left of the main armament. Stored ammunition was 200 30 mm rounds, and 2,200 7.62mm rounds for the machine gun. =AML NA-2= Due to the increasing obsolescence of low pressure, direct fire weapons in the anti-tank role, Panhard manufactured at least one dedicated anti-tank guided missile carrier variant of the AML-90‚Äîthe same chassis with its turret removed and replaced by a launching system for four SS.11 or two SS.12/AS.12 missiles. Two 7.62mm machine guns were mounted to the centre of the new system for self-defence. =Other variants= Over a dozen variants of the Panhard AML were developed to meet a wide range of mission requirements, including border patrol, airfield security, light raiding duties, and liaison purposes. At some point Panhard developed four other vehicles for these roles based on the AML chassis but designated them EPF, EPA, ERA, and EPR, respectively. The liaison model, the EPR, was turretless and carried only a ring-mounted 12.7mm heavy machine gun. The ERA marketed for the role of raiding and harassing larger armoured or mechanised forces was similar to the AML-20, but could also carry a mount for six MILAN missiles in place of the 20 mm autocannon. The EPF and EPA carried up to three 7.62mm general-purpose machine guns apiece. Yet another variant, the AML Eclairage, was identical to the AML-20 and ERA. The AML-30 and AML-90 spawned amphibious models, which bore propellers and form-fitting, watertight boxes over their hulls. These were then inflated with polyurethane, allowing the armoured car to float. The polyurethane lining had the advantage of being self-extinguishing if ignited by flame, and of providing a detonation point for a hollow charge shell before it could reach the armour plate. Amphibious AMLs were propelled through the water at and were steered by their front wheels. The amphibious box increased the weight of the chassis by about ten percent. A Panhard AML-90 (left) and an Eland (right) at the Kubinka Tank Museum. Individual armies have also retrofitted existing AMLs with new armament adopted from other armoured vehicles, such as the complete turret and 30 mm RARDEN autocannon of the FV107 Scimitar light tank. The Eland Mk7 is an AML derivative built under licence in South Africa with a number of major modifications. Although the vehicle fulfills a similar role to its Panhard counterpart, it differs both in design and construction. The engine at the rear of the Eland is water-cooled whilst the French vehicle's engine is air- cooled, necessitating a different rear hull. An Eland's hull is also somewhat longer. Several companies currently offer upgrades or comprehensive rebuild packages for AMLs, particularly with regards to the elderly Panhard Model 4 HD engine, for which spare parts are difficult and expensive to source. Saymar, an Israeli firm, has proposed replacing it with a two-litre Toyota diesel engine developing 76 kW (102 hp). Another extensive AML modernisation programme is being marketed by a subsidiary of the Saudi Military Industries Corporation. Overhauled Saudi AML engines are supported on a horizontal sliding frame, allowing them to be replaced by a trained maintenance team in twenty minutes.

These examples included mounted RPK machine guns and communications not dissimilar to those in the BRDM-2. AMLs were first portrayed in the 1973 French thriller The Day of the Jackal, and 1974 Italian war film While There's War There's Hope, which featured an AML-90 of the Portuguese Armed Forces during the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence. Two AML-90s erroneously presented as German scout cars serving with the Afrika Korps appear in the 1984 French war film Les Morfalous.

Galambos J√≥zsef Andr√°s; June 28, 1924 in Hungary ‚Äì April 10, 1997 in Orange County, California) was an astrophysicist and philosopher who innovated a social structure that seeks to maximize human peace and freedom. While Galambos had much in common with his classical liberal contemporaries, his most unusual contributions concerned his theories on intellectual property, and his advocacy of a stateless society totally free of coercion, political or otherwise. He also is noteworthy for his integration of a wide variety of scientific, economic, and historical inputs in the creation of his ideal social structure, which he termed The Natural Republic. p.73 property is the most fundamental parameter of volitional science, where volition refers to the act of choosing (p. 11). Galambos distinguished his theory from that of Ludwig von Mises, subscribing to the same \\"subjective theory of value\\" in economics but deriving it from his own definition of property. pp.198‚Äì199 Galambos emphasized that von Mises failed to cover the production and marketing of intellectual property, that is, Primary Property, as noted in this article. The libertarian author and 1996 presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party, Harry Browne wrote of Andrew Galambos after his death: :\\"He was an Astrophysicist exclusively, but I refer to him as 'the unknown libertarian' because he never wrote a book or appeared on national radio or TV. His renown will be limited mostly to those who came in personal contact with him. But he had a profound effect on thousands of individuals who took his courses‚Äîwho in turn affected others. Undoubtedly the ripples from the stones he dropped eventually touched some of today's leading libertarians.\\" Early life Galambos was born in Hungary in 1924. His father, Joseph Galambos-Brown, had been an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army in World War I and then became a highly regarded architect. After the war, Galambos' father decided to emigrate to America to avoid his son becoming \\"cannon fodder\\" in a second world war, which he saw coming. Despite his father's wish to keep his son out of war, Galambos volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army during WWII. After completing his undergraduate work at City College of New York, he moved to Minnesota in 1948 where he met his future wife, Suzanne Siegel, a fellow student at the University of Minnesota. They married in 1949.Frederic G. Marks, attorney for Andrew J. Galambos from 1968‚Äì1989 and author of the internet book www.CapitalismTheLiberalRevolution.com is the source of this statement. Education Galambos earned degrees in physics from City College of New York and the University of Minnesota. Early career Galambos moved to Los Angeles in 1952 to work for North American Aviation. Beginning in 1958, Galambos worked in the Space Technology Laboratory (STL) division of Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, which later became TRW Space Technology Laboratories. There, Galambos worked as an astrophysicist calculating trajectories for Atlas ICBMs before the advent of high-speed digital computers. On the side, Galambos partnered with colleague Donald H. Allen in a business known as Universal Shares, which was an insurance and securities dealership. As Galambos' ideas on freedom and proprietary government crystallized, he became disillusioned with his work at STL, which had evolved almost exclusively to focus on the development of inter- continental ballistic missiles for military purposes. Galambos did not want to work on weapons of war. Around 1958‚Äì1959 Galambos formulated a proposal to the director of STL, George Mueller, for a project to develop rockets for space exploration, including lunar landings. Mueller turned it down. A few years later, however, Mueller took a position with NASA where he worked on the Apollo 11 manned lunar landing project, the same type of project he had turned down when Galambos proposed it to him at STL. In 1960, Galambos left the aerospace industry and joined the faculty of Whittier College to teach physics, astrophysics, and mathematics. While at Whittier, Galambos presented a popular extracurricular class entitled, \\"The Decline and Renaissance of Laissez-Faire Capitalism.\\" He also taught previously at New York University, Brooklyn College, Stevens Institute of Technology of Hoboken, New Jersey, the University of Minnesota, and Carleton College of Northfield, Minnesota. In 1960, Galambos traveled with his colleague, Alvin Lowi Jr., to New York City where they met with Leonard Read of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) who introduced them to Henry Hazlitt, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, and Ayn Rand.  The Free Enterprise Institute  In 1961, Galambos established The Free Enterprise Institute (FEI) which was the name he used for his teaching business. His initial course was entitled Course 100, Capitalism: The Key to Survival. He eventually taught courses on intellectual property, investments and insurance, financial planning, physics, and journalism, among others. Galambos had an important colleague in Jay Stuart Snelson (1936‚Äì2011). Snelson was the senior lecturer for FEI from 1964‚Äì1978, teaching both V-50 and V-201. In large part due to Snelson's teaching, at least 20,000 individuals attended courses offered by FEI during his tenure. =Courses V-50 and V-201= Course V-50T (the \\"T\\" was for Tape) was transcribed and published as Sic Itur Ad Astra (see below). Another course, V-201, focused on mechanisms for intellectual property protection for innovators. The initial letter \\"V\\" stands for volition, meaning the act of choosing, which is a fundamental characteristic of human beings. V-50T and V-201T are occasionally offered as tape recorded courses by The Free Enterprise Institute. In 1999 volume one of Sic Itur Ad Astra (\\"This is the Way to the Stars\\") () was first published. The book is a transcription of Course V-50. Volume two, for course V-201, as of January 2014 has not yet been published. Volitional science Galambos rejected the term social science, in part because most social scientists do not employ the scientific method to test their hypotheses. Jay Snelson suggested the term \\"volitional science\\" for its implication that volition, meaning the act of choosing, is at the center of Galambos' philosophy. p.50 In course V-50, Galambos laid out his two postulates of volitional science: * \\"Postulate Number One: All volitional beings live to pursue happiness,\\" , p. 96, also called the Pursuit of Happiness Postulate, p. 745 and * \\"Postulate Number Two: All concepts of happiness pursued through moral action are equally valid.\\" , phraseology from p. 756, also called this the Moral Postulate Galambos equates immoral action with coercion , p. 78 , p. 633 notes that a contract, or \\"voluntary agreement between two or more people\\" is a proper alternative to coercion and defines freedom as \\"the societal condition wherein every individual has one hundred percent control over his own property.\\" , p. 115 Thus making the enslavement of others immoral by definition. Galambos derives his theory from these postulates. The essence of Course V-50 is Galambos' elaboration of his theory of volitional science and his application of that science to solve the problems of human society. Property Galambos' concept of property was basic to his philosophy. He defined property as a man's life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life. Galambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. That is why he defined freedom as follows: \\"Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full (100%) control over his own property.\\" Galambos defines property as having the following elements: * Primordial property, which is an individual's life * Primary property, which includes ideas, thoughts, and actions * Secondary property, which includes all tangible and intangible possessions which are derivatives of the individual's primary property. Property includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individual's life; this means children are not the property of their parents,, p. 23 and also \\"primary property\\" (a person's own ideas)., pp. 39, 52, 84, 92, 93, 153, 201, 326. Galambos emphasized repeatedly that true government exists to protect property and that the state attacks property. For example, the state requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individual's money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a person's primordial property. Intellectual property In course V-201 Galambos focuses on primary property, which in his usage is quite similar to what has been called \\"intellectual property\\". Galambos argued that intellectual property owners should have primary control over their own ideas and over how others might use those ideas. According to Galambos, all forms of property come from a combination of \\"primordial property\\" (a person's life) and \\"primary property\\" (a person's own ideas). By using the natural resources available in the physical universe, individuals use their primordial property, guided by primary property (actions, guided by ideas, respectively) to create \\"secondary property\\". , pp. 104, 201, 326 , p. 671 notes that land cannot be owned, whereas the rights and claims of access to land, and use of land is secondary property Galambos posited that intellectual property deserved every bit as much, if not more, protection and recognition as secondary property. His rationale for this can be explained by the following example: Few would question that Ludwig van Beethoven's music was his intellectual property and that it should be protected. Current copyright laws do protect musical compositions but only for a limited period of time. Galambos taught that protection of artistic creations should be perpetual. While most would acknowledge Beethoven's intellectual property in the form of his musical compositions, almost everyone would deny that Isaac Newton's discovery and description of the universal law of gravitation is Newton's property. Newton's law of gravitation, as he expounded it, is no less a creation of his mind than Beethoven's 5th symphony. Beethoven created his music by his unique skill in the musical arts of composition, melody, harmony, counterpoint, and orchestration. Newton created his description of the universal law of gravitation by his unique skill in integrating the discoveries of his intellectual antecedents such as Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler. Furthermore, in order to work out his theory of gravitation, Newton had to innovate a completely new form of mathematics, the calculus. (Newton's contemporary, Gottfried Leibniz, also developed the calculus independently of Newton.) Galambos recognized that more than one person could create a specific new idea, including a scientific theory, independently of each other. He allowed for that in course V-201 by innovating a method to determine whether two or more innovators of the same thing are independent of each other. In the spirit of his teaching on intellectual property, some of Galambos' students were required to acknowledge a \\"proprietary notice\\" which asked those students to give credit (both intellectually and financially) for the information gleaned from his courses; later he required that all participants in his lectures sign a non-disclosure agreement to prevent publication of his ideas before he published them himself. Students were allowed to take notes for their private use and most lectures were taped. Galambos acknowledged and gave credit to antecedent sources such as Thomas Paine's writings, as typified by Common Sense and article 4 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen ‚Äì \\"4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law.\\" Government versus the State Galambos defined government as \\"any person or organization that sells services to protect property to which the owner of the property can voluntarily subscribe.\\" He described the term \\"state\\" as any person or organization that claims to protect property by coercing the owner of the property to use and pay for its services, claiming 'legality' as justification. According to these definitions, a government mechanism can be an insurance company that protects an individual's home from criminal activity and casualty loss such as fire or storm damage. A state is any political entity with coercive power, from a municipality to the political organization known as the United States of America. Golden Rule Galambos explained that the positive version of the Golden Rule (\\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\\") was problematic because it implied that it was acceptable for person A to \\"meddle\\" in the affairs of another provided person A would likewise appreciate the same thing done \\"unto\\" him/her. Galambos instead preferred the double negative version of the Golden Rule as the foundation for his philosophy. The double negative version is: \\"Do not do unto others as you would not have them do unto you.\\" Galambos explained that this version is \\"not subject to meddlesome interpretation.\\" Evolution of Galambos' philosophy Early in his career, Galambos supported Barry Goldwater's candidacy for the Republican nomination as president in 1960. , pp. 874‚Äì875 \\"The point at which conservatism becomes destructive is when it employs coercion to stifle the acceptance of a new idea.\\" However, as Galambos' understanding of the destruction and violence caused by the political state deepened, he ultimately rejected politics as a means of solving social problems. He instead advocated proprietary, profit-seeking companies as the best means for protection of all forms of property. He supported private property protection and defense, the absolute rights of the owner of private property, and was opposed to political voting and other forms of political activism. Galambos's first lectures given in 1961 focused on limited government. His early societal models were modified versions of the United States republic, with the addition of the \\"Resistor,\\" a body empowered to repeal laws passed by Congress if it judged them to be contrary to the Constitution.\\" Beginning around 1963, Galambos modified his lectures as a result of exposure to ideas from several of his contemporaries. Through his student, engineer Charles Estes and others including his colleague Alvin Lowi, Galambos came into contact with the ideas of Robert LeFevre, who advocated the idea that the state was absurd at best, and was actually an enemy of human freedom. Whereas Galambos highlighted in his lectures the state's abysmal performance in protecting life and property, Peter Bos (a colleague of Lowi who attended FEI lectures) suggested that insurance companies could replace the state in this vital role. Bos and Galambos envisioned a broader concept of insurance than the word implies to most people. In his lectures, Galambos theorized that insurance could include not only reimbursement for loss, but also prevention of loss, detection of individuals who cause loss, and the seeking of restitution from such individuals. Charles Estes had innovated an idea of restitution-based justice and a private, non-state justice system, to which Galambos was exposed in 1963. By 1964, the idea of restitution-based justice was incorporated firmly into Course V-50. When Alvin Lowi terminated his employment with FEI in 1963, he recommended Jay Stuart Snelson as his substitute. Snelson agreed to lecture for FEI provided the course was amended to incorporate the ideas of LeFevre, Bos, and Estes. Galambos eventually agreed. His original philosophy, which was undergoing major changes during that period, was modified to incorporate the respective ideas of LeFevre, Bos, and Estes on the disutility of government, the application of the insurance mechanism for protecting property, and a private-based justice system focused on restitution as opposed to incarceration. Criticism and controversy Galambos' teaching was controversial from the outset. The mere idea of a stateless society is controversial because the vast and overwhelming number of people cannot conceive of such a thing. Most believe that regrettable as it may be, coercion in the form of a political state is necessary for peace and security; that a stateless society would degenerate immediately into chaos.Statism Galambos taught that the state was really not a protector of property, but in effect was a protection racket, no different in principle than the mafia or the drug cartels plaguing Mexico, Central America and the United States. Galambos' idea of according property rights to ideas is controversial. Among the most passionate opponents of this idea are libertarian intellectuals who are aghast at the idea that anyone could limit their access to ideas of others. Death In the 1980s, Galambos was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He died on April 10, 1997.

During the attack, Kubi≈° threw the bomb that mortally wounded Heydrich. Biography Jan Kubi≈° was born in 1913 in Doln√≠ Vil√©movice, Moravia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (present-day Czech Republic). Jan was a Boy Scout. Jan Kubi≈°, having previously been an active member of Orel, started his military career as a Czechoslovak army conscript on 1 November 1935 by 31st Infantry Regiment \\"Arco\\" in Jihlava. After passing petty officer course and promotion to corporal, Kubi≈° served some time in Znojmo before being transferred to 34th infantry regiment \\"Marksman Jan ƒåapek\\" in Opava, where he served at guard battalion stationed in Jakartovice. Here, Kubi≈° reached promotion to platoon sergeant. During the Czechoslovak mobilisation of 1938, Kubi≈° served as deputy commander of a platoon in Czechoslovak border fortifications in the Opava area. Following the Munich Agreement and demobilisation, Kubi≈° was discharged from army on 19 October 1938 and returned to his civilian life, working at a brick factory. At the eve of World War II, on 16 June 1939, Kubi≈° fled Czechoslovakia and joined a forming Czechoslovak unit in Krak√≥w, Poland. Soon he was transferred to Algiers, where he entered the French Foreign Legion. He fought in France during the early stage of World War II and received his Croix de guerre there. A month after the German victory in the Battle of France, Kubi≈° fled to Great Britain, where he received training as a paratrooper. The Free Czechoslovaks, as he and other self-exiled Czechoslovaks were called, were stationed at Cholmondeley Castle near Malpas in Cheshire. He and his best friend, Jozef Gabƒç√≠k, both befriended the Ellison family, from Ightfield, Shropshire, whom they met while in Whitchurch, Shropshire. In 1941, Kubi≈° was dropped into Czechoslovakia as part of Operation Anthropoid, where he died following the successful assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. His remains were buried secretly in a mass grave at the ƒé√°blice cemetery in Prague. Since this was unknown after World War II, Karel ƒåurda, the member of their squad who betrayed them to the Nazis, was coincidentally also buried at the cemetery. However, in 1990 mass graves were excavated and a memorial site with symbolic gravestones was established instead. In 2009, a memorial was built at the place of the attack on Heydrich. The elimination of Heydrich in Prague Jozef Gabƒç√≠k and Jan Kubi≈° were airlifted along with seven soldiers from Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile in the United Kingdom and two other groups named Silver A and Silver B (who had different missions) by a Royal Air Force Halifax of No. 138 Squadron into Czechoslovakia at 10 pm on 28 December 1941. In Prague, they contacted several families and anti-Nazi organisations who helped them during the preparations for the assassination. On 27 May 1942, Heydrich had planned to meet Hitler in Berlin. German documents suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German occupied France, where the French resistance was gaining ground. Heydrich would have to pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merged with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction, in the Prague suburb of Libe≈à, was well-suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. At 10:30 am, Heydrich proceeded on his daily commute from his home in Panensk√© B≈ôe≈æany to Prague Castle. Gabƒç√≠k and Kubi≈° waited at the tram stop on the curve near Bulovka Hospital in Prague 8-Libe≈à. As Heydrich's open-topped Mercedes-Benz neared the pair, Gabƒç√≠k tried to open fire, but his Sten gun jammed. Heydrich ordered his driver, SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer Klein, to stop the car. As the car braked in front of him, Kubi≈° threw a modified anti-tank grenadeMichel, Wolfgang, Britische Spezialwaffen 1939‚Äì1945: Ausr√ºstung f√ºr Eliteeinheiten, Geheimdienst und Widerstand, p. 72. (concealed in a briefcase) at the vehicle; he misjudged his throw. Instead of landing inside the Mercedes, it landed against the rear wheel. Nonetheless, the bomb severely wounded Heydrich when it detonated, its fragments ripping through the right rear fender and embedding shrapnel from the upholstery of the car into Heydrich, causing serious injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen and lung, as well as a fractured rib. Kubi≈° received a minor wound to his face from the sharpnel. As Kubi≈° staggered against the railings, Klein leapt out of the shattered limousine with a drawn pistol; Kubi≈° recovered and jumped on his bicycle and pedaled away, scattering passengers spilling from the tram, by firing in the air with his Colt M1903 pistol. Klein tried to fire at him but dazed by the explosion, pressed the magazine release catch and the gun jammed. A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a delivery van. Heydrich was first placed in the driver's cab, but complained that the van's movement was causing him pain. He was placed in the back of the van, on his stomach, and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. Heydrich had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and lung. He had also fractured a rib. Dr Slanina packed the chest wound, while Dr Walter Diek tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Drs Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed. Himmler ordered Dr Karl Gebhardt to fly to Prague to assume care. Despite a fever, Heydrich's recovery appeared to progress well. Dr Theodor Morell, Hitler's personal physician, suggested the use of sulfonamide (an antibacterial drug), but Gebhardt, thinking Heydrich would recover, refused. On 2 June, during a visit by Himmler, Heydrich reconciled himself to his fate by reciting a part of one of his father's operas. Heydrich slipped into a coma after Himmler's visit and never regained consciousness. He died on 4 June, probably around 04:30. He was 38. The autopsy concluded that he died of sepsis. Heydrich's facial expression as he died betrayed an \\"uncanny spirituality and entirely perverted beauty, like a renaissance Cardinal,\\" according to Bernhard Wehner, a Kripo police official who investigated the assassination. =Attempted capture of the parachutists= Bullet-scarred window of the Church of St Cyril and St Methodious in Prague where Kubi≈° and his compatriots were cornered Kubi≈° and his group were found on 18 June in the Church of St Cyril and St Methodious in Resslova Street in Prague. In a bloody battle that lasted for six hours, Kubi≈° was seriously wounded by a grenade and was found unconscious. Heinz Pannwitz, the German detective charged with capturing at least one of the perpetrators alive, later recalled his death: > He had tried to use poison on himself but apparently lost consciousness > before he could do so. Although he was immediately transferred to the > hospital none of the doctors‚Äô attempts to keep him alive succeeded. He died > within twenty minutes. The other parachutists committed suicide to avoid capture after an additional four-hour battle with the SS. In revenge, the Nazis murdered 24 family members and close relatives of Jan Kubi≈° in the concentration camp, Mauthausen: his father, both full and half-siblings, including their wives and husbands, cousins, aunts and uncles. Recognition Shortly after his successful mission, Kubi≈° (as well as Gabƒç√≠k) was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant in memoriam. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia he was further promoted to the rank of staff captain in memoriam. During the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the assassination of Heydrich in 2002, Kubi≈° was again promoted in memoriam, to the rank of colonel. Apart from the Czechoslovak Military Cross 1939 and Croix de Guerre (both he received in 1940), Kubi≈° was posthumously decorated with the Commemorative Medal of the Czechoslovak Army, F, GB (1944), another two Czechoslovak Military Crosses (1942, 1945), King's Commendation for Brave Conduct (1947), Czechoslovak Military Order for Liberty (1949), Military Order of the White Lion \\"For Victory\\" 1st Class (1968), Order of Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik (1992) and Cross of Defence of the Minister of Defence of the Czech Republic (2008). There are streets named after Jan Kubi≈° in the cities of Prague (close to the Operation Anthropoid Memorial), Pardubice, T√°bor, T≈ôeb√≠ƒç and other places. In 2013 (100th anniversary of Kubi≈°'s birth) a small memorial and museum was open in the house where Jan Kubi≈° was born. Since 2010 a National memorial and museum dedicated to all heroes related to the assassination of Heydrich is open in the crypt of Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Prague. Coinciding with the release of the 2016 film Anthropoid, campaigners called for Kubi≈°'s and Gabƒç√≠k's bodies to be identified and exhumed from the mass-grave at the cemetery in ƒé√°blice, Prague, and to be given a dignified burial fitting \\"the heroes of anti-Nazi resistance\\". Kubi≈° in film and fiction Jan Kubi≈° has been portrayed by Rudolf Jel√≠nek in the 1964 film Atent√°t, Timothy Bottoms in the film Operation Daybreak and Miroslav Rataj in the film Sokolovo (both released in 1975), Patrik Stanƒõk in the 2011 film Lidice, by Jamie Dornan in the 2016 film Anthropoid and by Jack O'Connell in the 2017 film The Man with the Iron Heart.

He is credited with producing popular titles for Konami, including Gyruss and Time Pilot, and for Capcom, including Final Fight and Street Fighter II. He also played a role in the creation of Rockstar's Red Dead franchise. He later founded the company Game Republic, and then created the hit mobile games Dragon Hunter and Monster Strike for Mixi. Several franchises he helped create are among the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time, including Street Fighter II, Monster Strike and Red Dead. History =Early career at Konami= His early games Time Pilot (1982) and Gyruss (1983) innovated in the shoot 'em up genre during the golden age of arcade games. The Killer List of Videogames included both Gyruss and Time Pilot in its list of top 100 arcade games of all time. Although these games turned out to be successful titles for Konami, Okamoto's employer was not happy as apparently Okamoto had been told to create a driving game instead. Internal disagreements, financial and credible, caused his termination from Konami. =Career at Capcom= Joining Capcom in 1984, Okamoto directed several arcade games such as 1942 (1984), SonSon (1984), and Side Arms (1986). His 1985 shoot 'em up Gun.Smoke later inspired a spiritual successor, Red Dead Revolver, the first installment of the Red Dead series. The last game he directed was the 1989 CP System game Willow (1989). He would oversee the development of Capcoms subsequent games as a producer and was responsible for recruiting character designer Akira Yasuda for Capcom. Okamoto and Yasuda developed some of Capcom's biggest hits, most notably the beat 'em up game Final Fight (1989) and fighting game Street Fighter II (1991). Street Fighter II is estimated to have grossed as of 2017, making it the third highest-grossing video game of all time, after Space Invaders and Pac-Man. Okamoto worked on the 1996 survival horror game Resident Evil (Biohazard in Japan). Additionally, he produced the movie adaptation and its sequel. In 1997, he resigned from Capcom to start his own video game development company, Flagship. He continued to develop video games for Capcom through Flagship. Okamoto approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original intellectual property entitled S.W.A.T. It later adopted a Western theme at Okamoto's recommendation, redefining the acronym as \\"Spaghetti Western Action Team\\". It was intended to be a spiritual successor to Capcom's Gun.Smoke, a 1985 arcade shoot 'em up originally designed by Okamoto. Angel Studios began work on the game with Capcom's oversight and funding in 2000, and the latter announced the game as Red Dead Revolver in March 2002. Okamoto then left Capcom, which eventually canceled the game in August 2003. Rockstar Games acquired the rights to Red Dead Revolver in December 2003 and resumed development, releasing it for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in May 2004. In 2003, he left Flagship to form another video game company. =Game Republic= In 2005, Okamoto's new independent game company, Game Republic, released its first game Genji: Dawn of the Samurai. Genji is a game set in Feudal Japan with a similar playing style to the Onimusha series. A sequel, Genji: Days of the Blade, was released on the PlayStation 3 in late 2006. A new Game Republic game called Folklore (Folkssoul in Japan) was released in 2007. Okamoto also developed a typical party game called Every Party, which was a launch title for the Xbox 360 in Japan. In 2007, Game Republic signed with Brash Entertainment and started working on licensed games like Clash of the Titans. But then in November 2008, Brash Entertainment went out of business, and Game Republic had to turn to Namco Bandai for the release of Clash of the Titans. In 2011, Game Republic also shut down due to debt, and a year later, Okamoto announced that he had retired from making console games and started working on mobile games. =Mixi= In recent years, he created the mobile games Dragon Hunter and Monster Strike (2013) for Mixi. Dragon Hunter was a moderate success, before Monster Strike became a major hit, competing with Puzzle & Dragons for the top spot on mobile charts. By 2018, Monster Strike had grossed over $7.2 billion, surpassing Puzzle & Dragons to become the highest-grossing mobile app of all time. Influences and style Okamoto has said that he gets ideas from scenery from movies, citing particularly the works of Akira Kurosawa and Chinese ghost stories. He commented that \\"We don't make games for ourselves - I don't actually play games very much.\\" References External links *Yoshiki Okamoto personal website *Yoshiki Okamoto at MobyGames * *Game Republic homepage (Japanese) *E3 2001: The Yoshiki Okamoto Interview, IGN *Yoshiki Okamoto: The Clown Prince of Gaming, Gamers Today *FAQ: Yoshiki Okamoto, EDGE 1961 births Living people Japanese video game designers People from Ehime Prefecture Capcom people Red Dead ","title":"Yoshiki Okamoto"},{"id":"1218827","text":"Roswell \\"Bob\\" Garst (June 13, 1898 ‚Äì November 4, 1977) was an American farmer and seed company executive. He developed hybrid corn seed in 1930 that allowed greater crop yields than open-pollinated corn. He was perhaps most well known for hosting Nikita Khrushchev on his farm in Coon Rapids, Iowa, on September 23, 1959. He sold hybrid seed to the Soviet Union beginning in 1955 and played a role in improving US-Soviet communication. Biography Roswell Garst's parents were Edward Garst and Bertha Goodwin. He married Elizabeth Henak on January 31, 1921. Garst was founder of Garst & Thomas Co., which became one of the world's largest producers of hybrid seed corn. In the 1930s, Garst traveled around the Midwest convincing farmers of the benefits of hybrid seed corn. As an international agriculturalist, he encouraged modern farming methods to improve food production in many nations, including the Soviet Union, Chile, Hungary, Germany, and France. Garst was famous for offering (sometimes unsolicited) advice. When Khrushchev visited Coon Rapids, Garst could not help but discuss the US-Soviet political situation, and told Khrushchev, \\"You know, for a peasant, you're a damned poor horse trader.\\"The High Point Enterprise from High Point, North Carolina, August 4, 1974, p 52 Khrushchev apparently liked Garst enough after his previous visits to the Soviet Union to demand that Garst's farm be included on his 1959 tour of the U.S., where he famously stated that Iowa corn was superior to Ukrainian corn. Garst made six trips to the Soviet Union to teach about hybrid seed and farm mechanization. He also sent his sons, including David Garst, on similar trips. Garst, in his own view, was not only an agriculturalist, but also a goodwill ambassador promoting peace during the Cold War.Khrushchev-in-iowa He was diagnosed with cancer of the voice box in 1963. Roswell Garst died in 1977. Farm Since Garst's death, his farmstead has been preserved; in 2009, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places under the title of \\"Roswell and Elizabeth Garst Farmstead Historic District.\\" The farm was seen as historically significant because of its importance in general American history and because of its place as Garst's home.

Shiploads and boatloads of slaves in the domestic trade were transported from place to place on the waterways. Hundreds of vessels of various sizes and capacities were used to transport the slaves, generally from markets of the Upper South, where there was a surplus of slaves, to the Deep South, where the development of new cotton plantations created high demand for labor. International tensions developed when ships were forced by weather or incident into ports in Bermuda and the British West Indies, as the British freed the slaves as part of the banned trade on the high seas, even before its abolition of slavery in its territories in 1834. There were several cases: Comet (1830), Encomium (1833), Enterprise (1835), Hermosa (1840) and, most notably, the Creole case of 1841, the result of a ship slave revolt that forced the vessel into Nassau, Bahamas. British officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the Bahamas. Legal rights Prior to 1807, the 1787 U.S. Constitution and the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law were the only national United States laws on slavery. Individual states had enacted laws authorizing and regulating slavery within their boundaries. The Constitution prohibited regulation of slavery for 20 years. The multi-faceted 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves abolished the \\"importation of slaves\\" from Africa, effective in 1808. The United States and Great Britain patrolled to create an international blockade of Africa, trying to suppress the slave trade. In addition, US and British ships patrolled the Caribbean, where illegal slaves were generally brought for sale to the sugar plantations and smuggling into the US. The 1807 Act also regulated the United States' \\"coastwise slave trade\\"; it protected shipping by domestic slave traders between markets along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Attorneys argued that ships at sea were an extension of US sovereignty, which permitted domestic slave trade among the states. Conflict between US and Britain in Caribbean Complications developed between the US and Great Britain from their differing interpretations of the application of laws against the slave trade in the Caribbean colonies. When American merchant ships were forced by weather or incident into ports in Bermuda and the British West Indies, the British freed the slaves as part of the banned trade on the high seas, even before its abolition of slavery in its territories in 1834. As early as 1825, the Home Office in London had ruled that \\"any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the British West Indies would be manumitted, which led to 300 slaves owned by U.S. nationals being freed.\\"Gerald Horne, Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation, New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, p. 103 In addition, slaves who escaped to the Bahamas from Florida became free. Several cases occurred as anti-slavery agitation increased and abolition was passed: Comet (1830), Encomium (1833), Enterprise (1835), and Hermosa (1840) In each case, the British freed the slaves from the ships that had put into ports in Bermuda and the Bahamas, whether by weather or accident.Horne (2012), pp. 107-108 The most notable case was the 1841 Creole, the result of a ship slave revolt that forced the vessel into Nassau, Bahamas. One of the slave leaders had heard of slaves being freed from the Hermosa there the previous year.Jervey, Edward D. and Huber, C. Harold. \\"The Creole Affair\\", The Journal of Negro History, Vol. 65, No. 3 (Summer 1980), pp. 196‚Äì211, accessed 8 April 2013 Holding that the slaves were free persons illegally detained in slavery, British officials ultimately freed the 128 of 135 slaves from the Creole who chose to stay in the Bahamas. It has been termed the \\"most successful slave revolt in US history\\". The US slaveholders feared this would encourage other slave ship revolts. Selected list of laws and court rulings The following are generally considered the most important United States statutory laws and case laws on slavery, in the order of their enactment: :1787: U.S. Constitution :1793: Fugitive Slave Law :1807: Congressional Act banning the \\"importation of slaves\\" :1841: United States v.

Note: The historian Samuel Eliot Morison in 1965 described the Amistad case as the most important court case involving slavery before being eclipsed by that of Dred Scott. :1850: Fugitive Slave Law :1857: Dred Scott case, US Supreme Court :1865: 13th Amendment to the US Constitution Cabotage The act of sailing along a coast and using landmarks for guidance is called cabotage, from the French word caboter (\\"to coast,\\" \\"go from cape to cape\\").

History and development =Early years= Following the development of the penitentiary by the Philadelphia Quakers in the 1780s, the concept of penitence‚Äîisolation, work and religious contemplation‚Äîinfluenced the design and operation of prisons, not only in North America, but also in Europe, South America and Asia.Johnson, N. (2011). Prison Reform in Pennsylvania . The Pennsylvania Prison Society. Retrieved on: 2011-09-08. The \\"Auburn system\\" developed at the Auburn Penitentiary in New York adopted the penitentiary sentence of the Philadelphia model, but added prisoners' labour, in the belief that work and training would assist in reforming criminals. The Kingston Penitentiary, based on the Auburn System, was built in 1835.Johnson, D. Kingston Penitentiary and the Auburn Approach, in \\"Prison Architecture.\\" Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved on: 2011-09-09.Correctional Service of Canada. Penitentiaries in Canada . Retrieved on: 2011-09-08. Initially operated as a provincial jail, the penitentiary came under federal jurisdiction following the passage of the British North America Act in 1867. Warden Samuel L. Bedson, Manitoba Penitentiary(1880) In 1868, the first Penitentiary Act brought prisons in Saint John, New Brunswick and Halifax, along with Kingston, under federal jurisdiction. Over the next twelve years, the federal government built Saint- Vincent-de-Paul Penitentiary in Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec (1873), Manitoba Penitentiary, in Stoney Mountain, Manitoba (1877), British Columbia Penitentiary, in New Westminster, British Columbia (1878) and Dorchester Penitentiary, in Dorchester, New Brunswick (1880). The regime of these prisons included productive labour during the day, solitary confinement during leisure hours and the rule of silence at all times. While there was no parole, prisoners with good conduct could have three days per month remitted from their sentence. =Reformation and rehabilitation= The Royal Commission to Investigate the Penal System of Canada (the Archambault Commission) was formed in response to a series of riots and strikes in the 1930s.Correctional Service of Canada. History of the Canadian Correctional System . Retrieved on: 2011-09-09. The Archambault report, published in 1938, proposed sweeping changes for Canadian penitentiaries, with emphasis on crime prevention and the rehabilitation of prisoners. The Commission recommended a complete revision of penitentiary regulations to provide \\"strict but humane discipline and the reformation and rehabilitation of prisoners.\\" While the commission's recommendations were not immediately implemented due to the advent of World War II, much of the report's philosophy remains influential. After the Second World War, prison populations dropped, causing undercrowding and prison disturbances. This led to the creation of the Fauteaux Committee in 1953. The Committee saw prisons not merely as fulfilling a custodial role, but also to provide programs that would promote \\"worthwhile and creative activity\\" and address the basic behaviour, attitudes and patterns of inmates. This meant prisons had to change to support such programs and provide opportunities for vocational training, pre-release and after-care programs. The Fauteux Report recommended hiring more, and better-trained, personnel, including those with professional qualifications in social work, psychology, psychiatry, criminology and law. An important legacy of the Committee was the creation of the National Parole Board in 1959 and the development of a system of parole to replace the former ticket of leave system.Roberts, J and D. Cole (1999). Making sense of sentencing. 147. University of Toronto Press. While stating that parole was not to be a reduction, or undermining, of the sentence, the committee emphasized its strong support for parole: > Parole is a well-recognized procedure which is designed to be a logical step > in the reformation and rehabilitation of a person who has been convicted of > an offence and, as a result, is undergoing imprisonment... It is a > transitional step between close confinement in an institution and absolute > freedom in society (Fauteux 1956, 51).'\\" The Penitentiary Act was amended in 1961 and a plan enacted to build ten new penitentiaries across Canada to implement the Fauteaux Committee's recommendations. =Queen Elizabeth's commissioning of the CSC= In the 1970s, there was a movement to combine the then Penitentiary Service and the National Parole Service. This resulted in a Report to Parliament by the Sub- Committee on the Penitentiary System in Canada, chaired by Mark MacGuigan. The move toward consolidation was recognized by Commissioner Donald Yeomans, who referred to \\"...our efforts to come up with a title for our Service which will give us a proper identity and project the image of the merger of the Penitentiary Service and the National Parole Service.\\" and announced that the name would be \\"The Correctional Service of Canada.\\" (Yeomans, April 5, 1979). The Correctional Service of Canada was established in 1979, following the merger of the Canadian Penitentiary Service and the National Parole Service, in 1976. Carl Lochnan, an expert in the field of Heraldry, who developed the Order of Canada, was contracted to develop the new Coat of Arms for the Commissioning of the Correctional Service of Canada. Lochnan filed a research document that stated in part the background philosophy on the given development: On December 21, 1978, Commissioner Donald R. Yeomans approved the chosen design. In early 1979, the Coat-of-Arms was forwarded by Solicitor General Jean-Jacques Blais to the Governor General requesting the Queen's approval (Blais, March 29, 1979). On April 10, Queen Elizabeth II gave Royal Assent and authorization of the new Coat-of-Arms (Joly de Lotbiniere, April 20, 1979).

A determinate sentence is a sentence with a completion date (example five years, seven months), called a \\"Warrant Expiry\\". This date is court imposed, at which time Correctional Service Canada no longer has jurisdiction over the offender. An indeterminate sentence is a sentence that is commonly referred to as a \\"life sentence\\". Correctional Service Canada has jurisdiction over the offender until the offender passes away. Although the court does impose a minimum number of years before the offender can apply to the Parole Board of Canada for conditional release. Thus, a court-imposed sentence of life with no parole for twenty-five years would indicate that the offender would be incarcerated for a minimum of twenty five years prior to consideration for a potential conditional release to the community, under the supervision of a community parole officer. As of 2006 the incarceration rate in Canada was 107 per 100,000 people; one seventh that of the United States'. Security classification of offenders There are three levels of security within Correctional Service Canada. They include maximum, medium, and minimum. Case management is completed by institutional parole officers (POs) within institutions, and by community parole officers in the community. The Parole Board of Canada has the complete responsibility in making liberty decisions at the point in the court-imposed sentence where an offender is allowed to live in the community on conditional release. Once an offender is sentenced by a court to a sentence of two (2) years or more the offender comes under the jurisdiction of Correctional Service Canada. An institutional parole officer completes a comprehensive assessment of the offender's criminality and formulates an \\"offender security classification report\\" and a \\"correctional plan\\". It is this correctional plan that the offender will be assessed against for the entire court-imposed sentence. Preparing offenders for their return to the community is an important focus for the Correctional Services of Canada. This preparation has become more difficult in recent years due to over crowding prisons and cutbacks in rehabilitative services of offenders. Parole officers who monitor these offenders are now stretched thin making these officers do more with less to work with. With this being such a big issue, the Correctional services of Canada developed the Integrated Police-Parole Initiative (IPPI). Also known as the Community Correctional Liaison Officer (CCLO) program. The IPPI received funding to begin operations in 16 locations across Canada in 2006-2007. This program places police officers in Correctional Services of Canada offices, where they support the activities of the parole staff. The officers specifically work with high-risk offenders in their transition to the community to try an increase public safety. High-risk, ex-prisoners face numerous challenges in re-entering their community, both personal and bureaucratic or legal. Many return to the neighborhood where they committed the crime, and deal with temptations of gang-life, criminal associates and substance abuse. With this, there should be no surprise that studies have shown that over two-thirds of offenders are rearrested within three years of release. These stats are what pushed the IPPI program to pay special attention to parolees with the highest level of risk; in the first months following release; and returning to locations with the highest levels of criminality. IPPI realized that there needed to be a different approach and make the parole officers more involved on a face-to-face basis which resulted in a more successful transition to the real world for ex-prisoners.Axford, M., & Ruddell, R. (2010). Police-Parole Partnerships in Canada: A Review of a Promising Programme. International Journal of Police Science & Management, 12(2), 274-286. doi:10.1350/ijps.2010.12.2.172 Employees Most personnel are plain clothed including, Parole Officers, Program Facilitators, Psychologists, Staff Training Officers, Assessment and Intervention Managers, Security Intelligence Officers, Assistant/Deputy Wardens, and the Institutional Head, called the \\"Warden\\". Each Region of Canada has a \\"Deputy Commissioner\\" who reports directly to the Commissioner of Correctional Service Canada, who is based in the National Capital Region (Ottawa, Ontario). Employees working at federal penitentiaries are designated as federal Peace Officers under Section 10 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. =Uniformed correctional officers= A Correctional Officer is an employee of the Public Service of Canada. All CSC Correctional Officers are uniformed and are designated as federal Peace Officers under Section 10 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. The rank structure in CSC begins at entry as a Correctional Officer 1 (CX-01), also known as COI. These officers are responsible for security functions at the institution including patrols, security posts, first response, and escorts. A Correctional Officer 2 (CX-02), or COII, is typically assigned to positions requiring a more experienced officer that works various posts including living units, communications, or visits. Correctional Officers who are specifically designated for Federally Sentenced Women (FSW) are called Primary Workers and have an entry rank of COII. A COII is not in any way a supervisory role to a COI, but are used to coordinate officers within their sector.http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/acts-and- regulations/567-cd-eng.shtml Once officers move into a supervisory role, which starts at Staff Training Officer (CX-03, formerly Correctional Supervisor), the uniform shirt colour is changed from navy blue to light blue. The Correctional Manager (CX-04), or CM, is the Institutional Supervisor, and historically had been referred to as the \\"Keeper of the Keys\\", or in short the \\"Keeper\\". All rank insignia is worn as shoulder epaulets attached to the shoulder straps of the uniform as either the word \\"RECRUIT\\" for officer recruits currently in training, or as 1, 2, 3, or 4 gold bars. Within CSC, dress uniforms are available to staff member outside of the correctional officer ranks. Senior rank (worn as epaulets and typically only present on dress uniforms) are as follows: *Commissioner: Crown, above a crossed key and torch, with four towers displayed below. *Senior Deputy Commissioner: Crown, above a crossed key and torch, with three towers displayed below. *Assistant Commissioner: Same as above, but with two towers. *Regional Deputy Commissioner: Same as above, with one tower. Uniformed Correctional Officers in the ranks of Correctional Officer 1, Correctional Officer 2, and Staff Training Officer are unionized and as such are members of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers (UCCO). Dress uniforms echo the same rank as displayed above. Each institution has a Ceremonial Unit that represent the Service at formal events across Canada and internationally. Examples of such events include local and ceremonial parades, funerals, recruit graduations, and national and international commemoration services. The Ceremonial Unit consists of a Guard of Honour, the CSC Community Pipes and Drums Band and a Ceremonial Guard. Through their activities, the Unit is a proud public face for the Service's Correctional Officers, Parole Officers, and other staff, who play an important role in keeping communities safe for Canadians. Ceremonial rank structure is as follows, typically worn as epaulets on the dress uniform shirt and tunic. *National Ceremonial Commander: Three stars (pips) centered with crossed key and torch. *National Command Sergeant-Major: Rank positioned on the right sleeve depicting the Royal Crown above a crossed key and torch, and encircled by a laurel wreath. A crimson shoulder sash to be worn under the right shoulder strap of the tunic and across to the left hip. *Regional Ceremonial Commander: Three pips. *Regional Sergeant-Major: Rank positioned on the right sleeve depicting the Tudor Crown, a crossed key and torch, encircled by a laurel wreath. Crimson sash worn over the right shoulder and positioned under the right epaulet and right tunic lapel. *Institutional Squad Leader: Two pips. *Institutional Squad (2 i/c): One pip. =Institutional Emergency Response Team= Similar to those of Canadian police forces including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the CSC has formed Emergency Response Teams to support existing security functions. The IERT will respond to situations that require or may require a use of force or a special tactical response. These teams can be established across an entire region or within a single institution, depending on the size.

Retrieved August 15, 2010. Citizens' Advisory Committees Under section 7 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations and further by Commissioner's Directives CD 023, each institution and parole office must establish a Citizens' Advisory Committee (CAC) who are mandated to \\"contribute to the public safety by actively interacting with staff of the Correctional Service of Canada, the public and offenders, providing impartial advice and recommendations, thereby contributing to the quality of the correctional process.\\" Each institution and parole office forms the 'local committee' for which the CSC consult with on matters regarding correctional operations, programs, policies, and plans. They in turn participate in the regional committee (Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairies and Pacific) to coordinate initiatives for the region. Finally, the National Executive Committee is made up of the five CAC Regional Chairpersons as well as by the National Chairperson, who are responsible for liaison between the committees and the CSC HQ, monitor and review all policies or actions of the CSC at the local, regional and national levels and adopt cohesive strategy for all committees. All CAC members have, by law, the authority to have reasonable access to every part of the institution or parole office they are attached to, talk with all the staff and offenders or parolee within the organization and access to hearings (if the offender consents). These authorities are given to members once they have their applications approved and security clearances approved by CSC National Headquarters. Year of the Veteran participation In 2005, the Department of Veterans Affairs had the year designated the Year of the Veteran. At Kent Maximum Security Institution Officer Shane Firlotte submitted a proposal for all Correctional Officers who were also veterans, to be able to wear the Year of the Veteran pin on uniforms. The Commissioner of Corrections: Lucie McClung, with the support of the Chief of the Defence Staff, authorized the wearing of the pin, via a national memorandum to all staff, on the left breast pocket until December 31, 2005. This being in recognition of veterans continued service to the Public Service of Canada. Criticism and controversy In 2003, the CSC was criticized for its policies for reportedly releasing certain prisoners on a quota system. Scott Newark, a former prosecutor and executive director of the Canadian Police Association, who is now special counsel to the Ontario Attorney General's Office for Victims of Crime, stated that the Correctional Service of Canada is out of control and that \\"I think Canadians have good reason to be outraged.\\"\\"Easy Out: Catching those on the lam\\", CTV News, April 22, 2003.(retrieved on August 15, 2008) Newark stated that there is a big push in Correctional Services to get more offenders out of penitentiaries and onto the street in what is called \\"The Reintegration Project\\". Although this policy is cheaper than keeping convicts imprisoned, Newark's office contends convicts are being shoved out the door to meet a release quota. Newark stated that he had obtained documents to prove this, including memos, minutes, and confidential Corrections correspondence, and an internal memorandum talk about setting a \\"goal of a 50/50 split of offenders between institutions and the community\\". Lawrence MacAulay, who was the Solicitor General in charge of the CSC when the documents were written, denied that there were any quotas, stating that: \\"There are no quotas. There never was ... If anybody has the idea of a quota, they forgot to check with the minister.\\" However, shortly after this interview, MacAulay resigned and Wayne Easter took over as solicitor general. An internal Corrections audit reported that parole officers are overwhelmed. A senior union official said some parole officers, especially in cities, have caseloads of 40 or more instead of the recommended 18, and as a result, they are unable to do all of the crucial collateral checks in the community, such as talking to employers, landlords, neighbours and other family members. Police officers have also complained that when parole violators are apprehended, they are often immediately re-released back on parole. Officer Greg Sullivan, who is part of a team that tracks down parole violators, criticized the CSC, stating that \\"It gets really frustrating especially when you see violent offenders who are out several times over and we've gone after them two and three times in an eight- month period.\\" See also * Provincial correctional services in Canada * Federal Bureau of Prisons, an American equivalent to CSC, responsible for housing prisoners convicted of federal crimes * Department of Correctional Services (South Africa), another equivalent to CSC References External links * Canadian federal departments and agencies Government agencies established in 1978 Public Safety Canada Canada Uniformed services of Canada Federal law enforcement agencies of Canada ","title":"Correctional Service of Canada"},{"id":"1218839","text":"A chantry may refer to one of two meanings of the term. Firstly, it could mean the prayers and liturgy in the Christian church reserved for the dead as part of the search for atonement for sins committed during their life.\\"Atonement.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 It might include the mass and by extension, the endowment left for the purpose of the continuance of prayers and liturgy. It could be called a type of \\"trust fund\\" established during the pre-Reformation medieval era in England for the purpose of employing one or more priests to sing a stipulated number of services for the benefit of the soul of a specified deceased person, usually the donor who had established the chantry in his will. There could be a stipulated period of time immediately following her/his death. It was believed such masses might help atone for misdeeds and with mercy enable the soul to be granted eternal peace in the presence of God. Chantries were commonly established in England and were endowed with lands, rents from specified properties and other assets by the donor, usually in his will. The income from these assets maintained the \\"chantry\\" priest. Alternatively, a chantry chapel is a building on private land or a dedicated area or altar within a parish church or cathedral, set aside or built especially for the performance of the \\"chantry duties\\" by the priest. A chantry may occupy a single altar, for example in the side aisle of a church, rather than an enclosed chapel within a larger church, generally dedicated to the donor's favourite saint. Many chantry altars became richly endowed, often with gold furnishings and valuable vestments. Over the centuries, chantries increased in embellishments, often by attracting new donors and chantry priests. Those feoffees who could afford to employ them, in many cases enjoyed great wealth. Sometimes this led to corruption of the consecrated life expected of clergymen. It also led in general to an accumulation of great wealth and power in the Church, beyond the feudal control of the Crown. This evident amassing of assets was one of the pretexts used by King Henry VIII to order the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England. At that time, chantries were abolished and their assets were sold or granted to persons at the discretion of Henry and his son King Edward VI, via the Court of Augmentations. Many Tudor businessmen, such as Thomas Bell (1486‚Äì1566) of Gloucester, acquired chantries as financial investments for the afterlife, but yielding income streams in the here and now, derived from chantry rents, or they \\"unbundled\\" the chantry assets and sold them on piecemeal at a profit. Mass for the dead The Christian practice of prayer and offering mass for the repose of the soul of a deceased person is recorded as early as the 8th century. The most common form was the anniversarium or missa annualis, a mass said annually on the anniversary of a person's death. At the Council of Attigny in 765, about 40 abbots and bishops agreed to say mass and recite the psalms for the repose of the souls of their deceased brethren. Ninth-century France and England have records of numerous such undertakings between monasteries and churches, whereby they would offer prayers for the souls of deceased members of each other's communities. Before the year 1000 in Italy, France and England, parishes extended the benefits of such facilities to the laity. Kings and great magnates asked for prayers for their souls in the monasteries they had founded. Etymology The word \\"chantry\\" derives, from Old French chanter and from the Latin cantare (to sing).J.R.V. & J.F. Charles Marchant, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, revised edition, 1892 Its mediaeval derivative, cantaria means \\"licence to sing mass\\". The French term for this commemorative institution is chapellenie (chaplaincy).The New Cassell's French Dictionary, ed. Denis Girard, et al., revised edition, New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1973, p. 144 Origin Current theories (Colvin) locate the origins of the chantry in the rapid expansion of regular monasteries in the 11th century. The abbey of Cluny and its hundreds of daughter houses were central to this. The Cluniac order emphasised an elaborate liturgy as the centre of its common life; it developed an unrivalled liturgy for the dead and offered its benefits to its patrons. By the 1150s, the order had so many demands for multiple masses for the dead that Peter the Venerable placed a moratorium on further endowments. Other monastic orders also benefited from this movement, but similarly became burdened by commemoration. The history of the Cistercian house of Bordesley (Worcestershire), a royal abbey, demonstrates this: in the mid-12th century, it offered the services of two priest monks, presumably to say mass, for the soul of Robert de Stafford; between 1162 and 1173, it offered the services of an additional six monks for the souls of Earl Hugh of Chester and his family. This sort of dedication of prayers towards particular individuals was a step towards the institutional chantry. Another theory (Crouch) points to the parallel development of communities or colleges of secular priests or canons as an influence on the evolution of the chantry. Such communities were not monastic foundations: although members lived a similar lifestyle to monks they differed in that their monastic rule was relaxed to allow preaching and ministry, beyond the confines of their institution, to the population at large. Like the monasteries, they offered dedicated prayers for the dead. An example is the collegiate church of Marwell (Hampshire), founded by Bishop Henry of Winchester in the early 1160s. The priests of the college were to pray for the souls of the bishops of Winchester and kings of England. Gradually perpetual masses for the dead were delegated to one altar and one secular priest within a greater church. Henry II of England The family of King Henry II of England (1154‚Äì1189) contributed greatly to religious patronage. Henry II founded at least one daily mass for his soul by his gift of the manor of Lingoed in Gwent to Dore Abbey in Herefordshire; he provided for the services in perpetuity of four monk- priests. In 1183 the king lost his eldest son, Henry the Young King. In 1185 his third son, Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, died in a tournament near Paris. Henry II commemorated his sons by founding what resembled the classic institutional chantry: he endowed altars and priests at Rouen Cathedral in perpetuity for the soul of the Young Henry. King Philip II of France endowed priests at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris for the soul of Duke Geoffrey. John, Count of Mortain, the youngest son of Henry II, also created chantry- like foundations: in 1192 he endowed the collegiate church of Bakewell in Derbyshire for the establishment of a prebend at Lichfield Cathedral; the holder was to celebrate mass in perpetuity for John's soul. The concept of the institutional chantry thus developed in the 1180s within English and French royal circles, which were wealthy enough to endow them. In non-royal society, the first perpetual mass was endowed by Richard FitzReiner, Sheriff of the City of London, in his private chapel within his manor of Broad Colney in Hertfordshire. He established it by the terms of his last testament in 1191, and the chantry was operational in 1212. In close association with the Angevin royal court, Richard may have adopted its religious practice. Provision in later medieval England Chantry Chapel of St Mary the Virgin, Wakefield Analysis of later medieval wills has shown that the chantry appeared in many forms. A perpetual chantry consisted of one or more priests, in a private free-standing chapel, usually licensed by the local bishop (such as the surviving one at Noseley, Leicestershire) or in an aisle of a greater church. If chantries were in religious communities, they were sometimes headed by a warden or archpriest. Such chantries generally had constitutions directing the terms by which priests might be appointed and how they were to be supervised. The perpetual chantry was the most prestigious and expensive option for the wealthy burgess or nobleman. A lesser option was the endowment of a fixed-term chantry, to fund masses sung by one or two priests at a side altar. Terms ranging from one to ten years were more common than the perpetual variety of chantry. Abolition of Chantries Acts, 1545 and 1547 William Wyggeston's chantry house, built around 1511, in Leicester: the building housed two priests, who served at a chantry chapel in the nearby St Mary de Castro church. It was sold as a private dwelling after the dissolution of the chantries. Following the Reformation in England initiated by King Henry VIII, Parliament passed an Act in 1545 which defined chantries as representing misapplied funds and misappropriated lands. The Act provided that all chantries and their properties would thenceforth belong to the King for as long as he should live. In conjunction with the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Act helped to finance the war with France. Because Henry lived for only two years after the Act was passed, few chantries were closed or transferred to him. His young son and successor, King Edward VI, signed a new Act in 1547, which ended 2,374 chantries and guild chapels and seized their assets; it also instituted inquiries to determine all of their possessions.G. R. Elton, The Tudor Constitution (1960) pp 372, 382-85. Although the Act required the money to go to \\"charitable\\" ends and the \\"public good\\", most of it appears to have gone to friends of the Court.A.G. Dickens, The English Reformation (1964) pp 205-17. The Crown sold many chantries to private citizens; for example, in 1548 Thomas Bell of Gloucester purchased at least five in his city. The Act provided that the Crown had to guarantee a pension to all chantry priests displaced by its implementation. An example of the fate of an abolished chantry is St Anne's Chapel in Barnstaple, Devon: its assets were acquired by the Mayor of Barnstaple and others in 1585, some time after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The deed of feoffment dated 1 November 1585 exists in the George Grant Francis collection in Cardiff, summarised as follows:RISW GGF 1/122 Feoffment, dated 1 Nov. 1585; [1 parchment, 4 papers, 3 seals, in English, originally A10 or Box IX/i > i) Robert Appley the elder, Robert Cade, Hugh Brasyer and Richard Wetheridge > of Barnestaple to: ii) William Plamer, mayor of Barnestaple, Richard > Dodderidge, Roger Cade, Symon Monngey, Robert Appley the younger, Robert > Pronze (Prouse?), Roger Beaple, George Pyne, gent., Jacob Wescombe, Gilbert > Hareys, Robert Marlen, Thomas Mathewe, James Beaple, George Baker, James > Downe, William Bayly, John Collybeare, Robert Collybeare and John Knyll of > Barnestaple; 1 Chancery and Chapel of St Anne lately dissolved in > Barnestaple with 1 house with land belonging to the late Chancery and > Chapel; also 1 house and land in Barnestaple which John Littlestone of > Barnestaple, merchant and John Buddle, potter granted to (i). One of the most significant effects of the chantries, and the most significant loss resulting from their suppression, was educational, as chantry priests had provided education. Since they were not ordinaries, neither did they offer public masses, they could serve their communities in other ways. When King Edward VI closed the chantries, priests were displaced who had previously taught the urban poor and rural residents; afterwards such people suffered greatly diminished access to education for their children. Some of the chantries were converted into the grammar schools named after King Edward. Royal Peculiars were not covered by any of the above Acts of Parliament, so were not abolished. Most declined over time, until the jurisdiction of almost all was abolished in the 19th century. Some royal peculiars survive, including Westminster Abbey and St George's Chapel, Windsor. Historian A.G. Dickens has concluded: :To Catholic opinion, the problem set by these legal confiscations ... [was] the disappearance of a large clerical society from their midst, the silencing of masses, the rupture of both visible and spiritual ties, which over so many centuries have linked rude provincial men with the great world of the Faith. In taking an essentially religious view of these events, these Englishmen seem to the present writer to have had every justification.... The Edwardian dissolution exerted its profounder effects in the field of religion. In large part it proved destructive, for while it helped to debar a revival of Catholic devotion it clearly contains elements which injured the reputation of Protestantism.A.G.

RBC returned in the Eredivisie in 2002 for four seasons. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, RBC just avoided the relegation playoff. Relegation could not be avoided a year later, with RBC finishing bottom of the Eredivisie in the 2005‚Äì06 season. = 2010s: Bankruptcy and a fresh beginning = On 8 June 2011, RBC Roosendaal was declared bankrupt after the board failed to repay the outstanding debts of ‚Ç¨1.6 million; this led to an automatic revocation of the professional license from KNVB. With RBC Roosendaal now out of Eerste Divisie, the board started working in order to register the club to the amateur Hoofdklasse league for the 15 June deadline. On 14 June 2011, it was announced that RBC would not play in the Hoofdklasse. On 21 September 2011, it was announced that the club would make a new start in Dutch football under the name RBC. RBC started season 2012‚Äì13 in the Vijfde Klasse, the 9th tier in Dutch football. It played its games at Sportpark Rimboe in the village of Wouwse Plantage, just south of Roosendaal. On 7 April 2013, its first promotion since their restart was confirmed after beating VV Rimboe 10‚Äì1. It played the 2013‚Äì14 season in the Vierde Klasse. One week after winning promotion, it won the championship of the division. After the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season it was announced that RBC would return to its old ground, the RBC Stadion. Stadion RBC per 1 augustus weer operationeel, Omroep Brabant (3 mei 2013) After finishing second two years in a row, RBC won a Vierde Klasse title in 2017 and it currently plays in the Derde Klasse. = 2020s: Cancelled merger with RKSV Halsteren and promotion = At the beginning of 2020 the club was again at the brink of a bankruptcy and was exploring a merger with RKSV Halsteren. A merger agreement has been reached and is contingent to supporter input.https://www.voetbalprimeur.nl/nieuws/923472/ex-profclub-rbc-kan- driedubbele-promotie-maken-door-op-handen-zijnde-fusie.html After already agreeing on a new name and colors, the clubs decided not to merge.https://www.internetbode.nl/regio/bergen-op-zoom/312556/fusie-tussen- rbc-en-halsteren-van-de-baan- In May 2020, RBC reached promotion to the Tweede Klasse after the Royal Dutch Football Association granted them the decision. RBC had won two period titles in the 2019‚Äì20 season, which had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

She is the daughter of Romanian-French photographer Irina Ionesco and came to international prominence as a child model after being featured in her mother's works. Early life Ionesco was born to photographer Irina Ionesco, a Frenchwoman of Romanian descent, who had a relationship with a Hungarian man who worked in the military. Prior to Ionesco's birth, her mother had worked as a contortionist as she had come from a family of circus performers on her maternal side. Her parents separated when she was 3 at which point Ionesco became estranged from her father. In 1977 her mother lost custody of her and Ionesco lived for a time with the parents of footwear designer Christian Louboutin who had already left home. From the age of 13 Ionesco became a regular club-goer at Le Palace along with Christian Louboutin and Edwige Belmore and also developed a drug habit. She was in and out of various foster homes until an older boyfriend of hers took custody of her at the age of 16. Career At the age of 5, Eva became her mother's favorite photo model. Irina Ionesco's erotic photographs of her young daughter Eva have been a source of controversy since they first appeared in the 1970s. Eva also modeled for other photographers such as Jacques Bourboulon.Eva Ionesco, tomb√©e des nus ‚Äì Lib√©ration ‚Äì Anne Diatkine ‚Äì 22 July 2010 She is the youngest model ever to appear in a Playboy nude pictorial, since she was featured at age 11 in the October 1976 issue of the Italian edition of the magazine in a set by Bourboulon. In that picture, she posed nude at a beach. Another of her nude pictorials, in the November 1978 issue of the Spanish edition of Penthouse, was a selection of her mother's photographs. She also appeared on the cover page of Der Spiegel at the age of 12 completely nude.Der Spiegel ‚Äì 23 May 1977 The issue was later expunged from the magazine's records. Eva Ionesco made her film d√©but at the age of 11 in 1976, playing a child in Roman Polanski's film The Tenant. A short time later she was cast in films of the mid-1970s such as Maladolescenza (also known as Puppy Love). Eva claimed her story served as inspiration for Louis Malle's film Pretty Baby,. In the 1980s, she attended the prestigious acting school Amandiers, directed by Patrice Ch√©reau and Pierre Romans. =Directorial career= Ionesco began directing in 2006. In 2011 she directed her first full-length feature film, My Little Princess which debuted at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. The film, loosely inspired by Ionesco's personal life, starred Isabelle Huppert as a predatory photographer who uses her young daughter as a model in a series of nude photos. Ionesco again paired with Isabelle Huppert for her next film, Golden Youth, about a young couple in Paris who begin to spend time with a much older and wealthier couple. Writing career In 2015 Ionesco's husband Simon Liberati released a book about their courtship and her childhood called Eva. In 2017 Ionesco released her first book, Innocence which dealt with her fractured relationship with her father. Legal disputes Since the time in which her mother lost custody of her for repeatedly photographing or allowing Ionesco to be photographed by others completely nude, Ionesco has been engaged in protracted court battles with her mother to censor and reclaim the images taken of her as a child. She tried three times to sue her mother for emotional distress, and the trial is still going on through various courts in France.Anne Diatkine, Isabelle Huppert dans \\"My little princess\\", ELLE France, 24 June 2011 In 1998 the French police confiscated from her mother's apartment hundreds of photographs in which she appears at the age of five in suggestive poses and in complete nudity. In 2012 Eva sued her mother for taking pornographic photos of her as a child. Although much of her claim was denied, she did receive some compensation. Personal life In 1995 Ionesco gave birth to a son, actor Lukas Ionesco. Ionesco has been married to author Simon Liberati since 2013.Simon Liberati, ¬´ Eva Ionesco : une petite princesse au Soleil levant ¬ª, Lib√©ration, 3 June 2014.

It is the locus of one end of a variable vector, with the other end fixed. The position of any plotted data on such a diagram is proportional to the velocity of the moving particle. It is also called a velocity diagram. It appears to have been used by James Bradley, but its practical development is mainly from Sir William Rowan Hamilton, who published an account of it in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy in 1846. Hodograph plot of upper air winds from radiosonde (Source: NOAA) Applications It is used in physics, astronomy, solid and fluid mechanics to plot deformation of material, motion of planets or any other data that involves the velocities of different parts of a body. See Swinging Atwood's machine =Meteorology= In meteorology, hodographs are used to plot winds from soundings of the Earth's atmosphere. It is a polar diagram where wind direction is indicated by the angle from the center axis and its strength by the distance from the center. In the figure to the right, at the bottom one finds values of wind at 4 heights above ground. They are plotted by the vectors vec V_0 to vec V_4. One has to notice that direction are plotted as mentioned in the upper right corner. With the hodograph and thermodynamic diagrams like the tephigram, meteorologists can calculate: * Wind shear: The lines uniting the extremities of successive vectors represent the variation in direction and value of the wind in a layer of the atmosphere. Wind shear is important information in the development of thunderstorms and future evolution of wind at these levels. * Turbulence: wind shear indicate the possible turbulence that would cause a hazard to aviation. * Temperature advection: change of temperature in a layer of air can be calculated by the direction of the wind at that level and the direction of the wind shear with the next level. In the northern hemisphere, warm air is to the right of a wind shear between levels in the atmosphere. The opposite is true in the southern one (see thermal wind). So in the example hodograph, the wind vec V_3 from southwest meet the right side of the wind shear which means a warm advection and thus warming of the air at that level.

He served as a Senator for Victoria from 2016 to 2019. Hinch was elected to the Senate representing Victoria as the head of Derryn Hinch's Justice Party at the 2016 federal election. Aged 72 at the time, Hinch was, when elected, the oldest federal parliamentarian ever to be elected for the first time.Australia's 45th Parliament: Meet the record breakers: ABC 31 August 2016 He lost his senate seat in the 2019 election.\\"Senate results: Hanson, Young returns but Hinch, Anning and Burston are gone\\" The Guardian 19 May 2019 https://www.theguardian.com/australia- news/2019/may/19/senate-results-hanson-young-returns-but-hinch-anning-and- burston-are-gone He remained host of his weekly program Hinch Live until the election campaign period officially commenced, in a decision supported by Sky News Live. He has been the host of 3AW's Drive radio show, and a National Public Affairs commentator for the Seven Network on Sunday Night, Today Tonight and Sunrise. Hinch has been convicted of contempt of court three times, serving two prison sentences and one sentence of house detention. Career =Print= Hinch began his career at the age of 15 with the Taranaki Herald in New Plymouth, New Zealand in 1960. In 1963, he came to Australia on the MS Wanganella and joined The Sun in Sydney. By 1966 he had become a foreign correspondent for the Fairfax organisation, and in New York became bureau chief in 1972. He remained living in New York for 11 years. Hinch returned to Sydney and was editor of The Sun in 1976‚Äì1977. = Television = Hinch hosted Beauty and the Beast on the Seven Network between 1982 and 1983. From 1987 to 1991, Hinch hosted his own current affairs show on the Seven Network titled Hinch, which later moved to Network Ten where it ran from 1992‚Äì1994. In 1994, Hinch joined the Nine Network and hosted The Midday Show for a year. He has also appeared on Dancing with the Stars, Underbelly and Millionaire Hot Seat as a guest playing for charity. In September 2012, Hinch rejoined the Seven Network as national public affairs commentator, though there were rumours that Hinch might make a comeback (although this never eventuated). From February 2015, Hinch hosted a twice weekly news opinion program, Hinch Live, over the weekend on Sky News Australia. *Hinch, Seven Network 1987‚Äì1991, then 1992‚Äì1994, Network Ten *Beauty and the Beast, Seven Network (1982‚Äì1983) *The Midday Show, Nine Network (1994) *Mars Venus, Foxtel (2003) *Dancing with the Stars, Seven Network (2005) *Underbelly, Nine Network (2008) *Seven News, Sunrise & Sunday Night National Public Affairs Commentator, Seven Network (2012‚Äì) *Hinch Live, Sky News Australia (2015-2016) =Radio= In the 1970s Hinch had short periods as host of programs on Sydney's 2UW and Melbourne's 3MP and 3XY. He broadcast from 3AW for most of the 1980s and 1990s, and then had further stints at the station in the 2000s and 2010s; he also had a short stint at 3AK He was often absent from the programs due to suspension, poor health and house arrest. In August 2012, it was announced Hinch's contract would not be renewed by 3AW, and he would be replaced by financial commentator Tom Elliott. He is the Melbourne correspondent for New Zealand radio network Newstalk ZB and often presents political commentaries on the station. =Acting= In September 2008, Hinch had a four-week run as The Criminologist (narrator) in the Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. He also appeared as himself, in a minor role, in the film The Wog Boy with Nick Giannopoulos, in 2000, and made cameo appearances on Fast Forward, which was the same sketch show where he was parodied as Hunch, played by Steve Vizard. Hinch played the role of Senator in 2016 movie The Colour of Darkness. =Politics= In 2015, Hinch established Derryn Hinch's Justice Party, and was subsequently elected to the Australian Senate as senator for Victoria at the 2016 double dissolution election on 2 July 2016. He became the oldest person ever newly elected to the Australian parliament. His party's main emphasis is on criminal justice reform, including tougher sentences for violent and sexual offenders, no bail for those accused of a serious violent offence, parole reform, and a public register of sex offenders. Other positions include equal rights for all citizens regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation, tougher laws against animal cruelty, and support for voluntary euthanasia.Derryn Hinch's Justice Party - official website Following the announcement of the 2016 Senate election results, other Senators negotiated, against Hinch's objections, to allocate him a three-year rather than a six-year Senate term. In August 2017, it was revealed that Hinch holds an American Social Security number, raising concerns during the dual citizenship crisis that he may be disqualified from office under Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. However, in September 2017, the Attorney- General made the decision not to refer him to the High Court. Hinch has shown support for capital punishment. In the 2019 elections, Hinch lost his seat in the Senate, with the seat going to the Greens. Hinch was seeking re-election after three years. This has left his party unrepresented in the Australian federal parliament, although it retains two seats in the Victorian Legislative Council. The constituencies represented being Western Victoriaand Northern Victoria. Controversies =Michael Glennon= In 1985, Hinch found that Michael Glennon, who had previously been convicted on a charge of indecent assault with a minor, was to be tried on new charges while still running a youth camp. Hinch, who says he was concerned that parents were unknowingly sending their children to Glennon's camp, first appealed privately to then Victorian Premier John Cain and the then-Attorney-General, as well as the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia, but in Hinch's words, they \\"washed their hands\\" of the situation. Subsequently, Hinch publicly identified Glennon during his trial on the third set of charges, in spite of the strong sub judice rule under Australian jurisprudence. This delayed the trial while Hinch was tried on contempt of court charges; Hinch was fined $10,000 and imprisoned for twelve days. This was the first time anyone had gone to prison on a prior restraint issue in Australia. Hinch appealed his case as far as the High Court of Australia, which affirmed his conviction. In its ruling the Court held that despite Hinch's motivation of warning the public that Glennon continued to hold a position in a youth organisation, it was sufficient to inform them of the current charges against him, and that the information about his prior conviction was prejudicial under Australian law. Hinch called the incident \\"the thing I'm most proud of in my life.\\" =Mick Gatto's call= On 24 June 2008, while Hinch was discussing the celebrity status of underworld crime figures during his drive program, Mick Gatto phoned in and had a brief confrontation with Hinch, ending with a death threat. =John Laws= On 30 July 2007, John Laws and Hinch attended the 40 Years of Radio Legends, after which Hinch complained the \\"event had been turned into a tribute to Laws\\", among other comments which caused ill feeling between the two. On 5 December 2007, Hinch was abused verbally with obscenities by John Laws while dining at lunch with 2CH personality Bob Rogers in a restaurant at the Finger Wharf in Woolloomooloo, Sydney. =Sexual relationship with teenager= In his 2004 book The Fall and Rise of Derryn Hinch, and in a radio editorial in March 2005, Hinch admitted to having sex with a 15-year-old female when he was in his early thirties, although he stated he \\"thought she was about 25\\". Following his on-air admission, Herald Sun journalist Andrew Bolt called for his prosecution. In 2013, Hinch wrote that after 30 years the woman had contacted him and said he was wrong about her age. She said she was born in 1961 and they met shortly after he joined 3AW in 1979. That made her 17 at the time of the liaison (which is above the age of consent in Australia). The ABC journalist James Purtill article on 6 July 2016 mentions only one (of the two) published self-admissions.  Criminal convictions  =1987 conviction and imprisonment= Hinch served 12 days in prison and was fined 15,000 in 1987 for contempt of court after he publicly revealed paedophile Roman Catholic priest Michael Charles Glennon's prior conviction while a trial was still pending. =2011 conviction and home detention= In June 2011, he was convicted of breaching suppression orders against the names of two sex offenders, and was subsequently sentenced to five months' home detention. =2014 conviction and imprisonment= In October 2013, Hinch was found guilty of contempt of court for breaching a suppression order by revealing details of the criminal history of Jill Meagher's killer, Adrian Ernest Bayley. The judge gave Hinch 90 days to pay the fine, or else face 50 days in prison. On 16 January 2014, one day prior to the expiration of the 90-day period, Hinch advised that he would not pay the fine 'on principle'. He was imprisoned on 17 January 2014. On 7 March 2014, he was released from prison after 50 days, having served his full sentence. He was greeted by his partner Natasha Chadwick, other friends and a substantial media contingent. Personal life Hinch has been married five times. His first marriage was to Lana Wells, an editor. His second marriage was to Eve Carpenter, a flight attendant. He then married Australian actress Jacki Weaver. They were married in 1983 and remained so for 13 years before divorcing in 1996. It has been widely reported that they remarried in 1997 before divorcing again in 1998, however Weaver has denied that any such second marriage ever took place. He married Chanel Hayton in February 2006 and they separated in late 2012. His most recent publicised relationship was with Natasha Chadwick, a former detective sergeant with NSW Police and freelance journalist. In March 2017, Hinch told the New Zealand Herald that he had been molested by a brother of one of his father's friends as a nine-year-old boy in his childhood home in New Plymouth in 1953. Hinch identifies as an atheist. = Health = In 2006, Hinch lost weight and his health declined.www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18767737-29277,00.html.dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story/0,20281,18667947-5001022,00.html. On 4 March 2007, he revealed on 60 Minutes he had been suffering from advanced cirrhosis of the liver, and that a tumour had been found on his liver. On 27 April 2007, Hinch returned to hospital for additional scans. On 4 August 2007, Hinch revealed he had inoperable liver cancer. On 20 September 2010, Hinch confirmed the liver cancer diagnosis, and said that he expected to undergo surgery to remove a third of his liver, and that this would take him off-air for several weeks. Doctors gave him a 60 per cent chance of surviving a further five years. On 4 November 2010, Hinch told his listeners that his doctors had told him that without a liver transplant, his maximum survival would be 12 months. On 6 July 2011, Hinch underwent liver transplant surgery at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne.

He also worked in the livestock, fertilizer, and chemical businesses, and contributed to foreign agricultural development projects in Eastern Europe, Central America, and the Caribbean. Garst believed that farming in the United States is fettered by governmental and environmental regulation. Garst was appointed by the Carter administration to the Presidential Mission on Agricultural Development in Central America and the Caribbean. The work of this committee led to the Caribbean Basin Initiative passed under President Ronald Reagan. Garst helped to develop the National Corn Growers Association that promoted open trade with Communist countries and sends aid in the form of farming technology to developing nations. In the 1990s, under the Clinton administration, Garst lead the agricultural portion of a development project in the Staritsky district of Moscow. The project included the development of a dairy industry, egg and broiler houses, hog farms, packing plants, roads, and marketing systems. Garst was a leader in Howard Dean's campaign in Iowa and was an active voice in the opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

In 2020, Newsweek ranked it as the 9th-best hospital in the world. Overview The hospital was established in 1948 as Israel's first military hospital, to treat Israeli casualties of 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It was founded in a cluster of abandoned military barracks from the Mandate era, and was originally known as Army Hospital No. 5. Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion had it renamed Tel HaShomer Hospital. In 1953, it became a civilian hospital, and Dr. Chaim Sheba became its director. Following Sheba's death, the hospital was renamed in his honor.Sheba History Situated on a campus in east Ramat Gan, Sheba today operates 120 departments and clinics. It has 1,700 beds, over 1,400 physicians, 2,600 nurses and 3,300 other healthcare workers. It handles over 1,000,000.5 patient visits a year, including 200,000 emergency visits annually, and conducts more than two million medical tests of all types each year, on a $320 million (approximate) annual budget. Sheba is supported by donations from a network of philanthropists and friends from around the world. Facilities thumb Padeh Geriatric Rehabilitation Center Sheba includes an acute care hospital, a rehabilitation hospital (one of the largest rehabilitation hospitals in the world, with 800 beds and 14 buildings), a women's hospital, a children's hospital, an eating disorder clinic, a PTSD clinic for soldiers, a laboratory division, an outpatient division, and an academic campus. The medical center is also home to the Israel National Center for Health Policy and Epidemiology Research (equivalent to the U.S. National Institutes of Health), the internationally acclaimed Israel National Center for Medical Simulation (MSR), the Israel National Blood Bank and Cord Blood Bank, and the Safra International Congenital Heart Center. Other major centers at Sheba include the Sheba Cancer Treatment and Research Centers, the Sheba Heart Center that was donated by Lev Leviev, and the Tel Hashomer Medical Research, Infrastructure and Services Co. Ltd., which provides global consulting and training services There is also a special rehabilitation hotel, the Shilev Hotel, for recuperating patients. It has 36 double rooms outfitted like ordinary hotels rooms, and a medical wing complete with a doctors office, nurses room, and treatment room. The medical center also maintains a hotel for guests who wish to remain close to a patient, and two shopping malls.Visitor Information Sheba provides services to patients from across the Middle East, including many patients (especially children) from the Palestinian Authority. It also provides guidance and mentoring in the planning, construction and operation of healthcare systems and hospitals around the world. Sheba has helped to found a multi-disciplinary clinic in Ukraine, an imaging Center in Uzbekistan, a medical center in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, an oncology center in Mauritania, a polyclinic in the Ivory Coast, and more. Sheba has sent medical support to Kosovo, Armenia, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Rwanda. Many patients from the Palestinian Authority and the Arab world are treated at Sheba.Dr. Yitshak Kreiss: Reinventing Israel's bigegst hospital Former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon was hospitalized at Sheba in May and November 2006. Research Work by Yaacov Agam at the Sheba Medical Center A large proportion of clinical research in Israel is conducted at Sheba. It is the main clinical trial venue for human health scientific studies conducted by the Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel Aviv University and Bar-Ilan University. In 2011, Sheba topped the list of Israeli hospitals for revenue acquired through research, at NIS 42.4 million, but came second in 2012. Scientific research at Sheba includes a study of pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue in a patient with ovarian failure after chemotherapy; a study of alginate-based stem cell biomaterial injected into heart attack victims that may repair heart tissue; and a study showing that heavy cell phone users are subject to a higher risks of benign and malignant tumors of the salivary gland. The Israeli company Ventor Technologies developed a novel type of heart valve which can be implanted by catheterization rather than open-heart surgery at Sheba. This invention was sold to medical device maker Medtronic in 2009 for US$325 million, of which about 10% went to Sheba Medical Center. Death of Omar Abu Jariban On 12 June 2008 at 11 a.m., Sheba Medical Centre discharged Omar Abu Jariban, despite still needing medical attention and being in a confused state, and handed him over to the police. Two days later, he was found dead by the side of Route 443, barefoot, still wearing a hospital gown, a cathether and a diaper. Abu Jariban, a Palestinian from Gaza, had allegedly stolen a car and was seriously injured in an accident on 28 May 2008. He was treated at Sheba Medical Centre, but discharged in very poor condition to the police. They first took him to Rehovot police station, but then dumped him by the side of a highway, barefoot and without food or water. He died from dehydration. After his body was identified, the police and hospital staff blamed each other for his death. In 2012, two Israeli police officers involved were convicted of negligent homicide and were sentenced to two and a half years in prison. Damages were paid to the family of the victim in the name of the police and the hospital.Chaim Levinson: How Israeli Negligence Led to the Death of a Palestinian Car Thief Haaretz, 20 February 2012; David Grossman: ◊ú◊û◊î ◊û◊ô ◊û◊™?

Training foreign students In 2011, the hospital signed agreements with St. George‚Äôs University in London and with the University of Nicosia (Cyprus) to train medical students for a fee of 25,000 euros per student and to award them MBBS degrees. Deans of several Israeli medical schools, including Yosef Mekori of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University, and Rivka Carmi, president of the Ben-Gurion University, criticised the programme, which they say will hurt the quality of the medical education received by Israeli students and damage medical care in Israel.Dan Even: Med Schools Rail as Sheba Plans to Prefer Foreign Interns Haaretz, 15 March 2011.

Marvel UK later produced original material by British creators such as Alan Moore, John Wagner, Dave Gibbons, Steve Dillon, and Grant Morrison. There were a number of editors in charge of overseeing the UK editions.

Publishing history = Predecessors = Reprints of American Marvel material had been published in the UK during the 1960s by Odhams Press under their Power Comics imprint. Titles such as Smash! and Fantastic featured a mix of Marvel reprint material and original non- Marvel work. This lasted till 1969 when the last superhero strip was removed from Smash!, leaving no Marvel titles being reprinted in the UK at all. = Origins: MWOM and Spider-Man Comics Weekly = In 1972, seeing a gap in the popular weekly comics market of the UK, Marvel Comics formed their own British publishing arm, Marvel UK (under the corporate name of Magazine Management London Ltd.). Though publishing comics in the UK for a British audience, Marvel UK was under the editorial direction of Marvel's New York offices, overseen by the young American writer/editor Tony Isabella.Wymann, Adrian. \\"The Mighty World of Bronze Age British Marvel (1972‚Äì1979) Part One, 1972‚Äì1974: Setting Up Marvel UK,\\" The Thought Balloon (2009). Accessed June 5, 2011. Starting with The Mighty World of MarvelPippa Melling (nee KING) was the first London Editor of Marvel Comix employed on a 6 months contact to set the whole thing up. Marvel UK started with mainly black-and-white with spot colouring except for the front and back pages which were in full colour. Originally the weekly comic was created by slicing up story lines from the monthly American versions of The Hulk, Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Four. A few months later Spider-Man Comics Weekly was released. Again this carried on reprinted American Spider-Man material originally started in MWOM, with the adventures of Thor starting as a back-up feature. The new title allowed an entire issue of the US The Amazing Spider-Man to be reprinted every week in the UK publication. Both of these initial series were huge successes and became the mainstays of the Marvel UK lineup; The Mighty World Of Marvel, in one form or another, was published continuously until 1984, while the Spider- Man weekly comic (under many different name changes) would continue until 1985. = Expansion = In 1973 Marvel UK launched The Avengers - starting with material from issue 4 of the US series which reintroduced Captain America (issues 1-3 were reprinted in MWOM). The new title introduced glossy covers around a smaller 36 page comic, down from the previous 40 page format of MWOM and Spider-Man Comics Weekly. Dr Strange was the back-up feature. Glossy covers were to be a distinctive feature of Marvel UK weeklies until the Marvel Revolution in 1979. The other two titles also changed to this new format. In Spiderman the decrease to 36 pages marked the reduction of Spiderman material so that now only half a US issue was reproduction in the UK weekly and Iron Man was added to the line up. (MWOM and SMCW had started at 40 pages but dropped to 32 before the launch of The Avengers.) In 1974 two new weeklies were added that departed from the usual superhero fare. These were Dracula Lives! and Planet of the Apes, the latter reprinting material from the American black & white Marvel Monster Group brand. In 1976 Dracula Lives! was cancelled and merged with Planet of the Apes as of issue 88. The Apes adventures lasted until 1977, the final months as a co-feature with the Hulk, in MWOM from issue 231. The non-superhero launches continued in early 1975 as Savage Sword of Conan was added as a weekly title. In March 1975, Marvel UK launched a new weekly title called The Super-Heroes (simultaneously with SSOC). Although it originally starred popular characters like the Silver Surfer and the X-Men, it eventually began reprinting stories starring such obscure characters such as Doc Savage, Ant-Man, The Cat, Scarecrow, and Bloodstone. Marvel UK's fifth superhero title, also debuting in 1975 (October), was The Titans, which was notable for its use of a \\"landscape\\" orientation. Although this format allowed two pages of Marvel U.S. artwork to fit onto one (magazine-sized) Marvel UK page, reader reaction was mixed, as it made the text small and often difficult to read. The Titans featured well- known characters like Captain America, Captain Marvel, the Sub-Mariner, the Inhumans, and Nick Fury. The Super-Heroes lasted fifty issues before being cancelled in early 1976, at which point it was merged into Spider-Man Comics Weekly, (which changed its title to Super Spider-Man with the Super-Heroes). At this point the book also changed orientation to become a landscape-format comic like The Titans. The aforementioned Titans title ran 58 issues until late 1976, when it too was cancelled. Towards the end of its run, the Avengers were moved over from The Mighty World of Marvel to be The Titans lead strip. As with The Super-Heroes, with The Titans cancellation it was merged with the weekly Spider-Man comic (which changed its title again, to Super Spider-Man and the Titans). = Tennant and Laing era = Marvel UK began to establish itself as a major publisher of weekly comic titles (along with D.C Thomson and IPC) under the direction of editor-in-chief Neil Tennant (later one of the Pet Shop Boys). Tennant was responsible for anglicising the dialogue of the comics to suit British readers, and for indicating where women needed to be redrawn more decently for the British editions. However, with the exception of some new covers drawn by Marvel Comics' American staff, no original material had yet been produced by Marvel UK. This changed in 1976 when Captain Britain Weekly was launched, featuring a hero created for the British market. Captain Britain Weekly featured new stories in colour as well as reprints of Nick Fury and Fantastic Four strips as backup. It was initially a success but eventually combined with Marvel UK's Spider-Man reprint title from #39. It was Neil Tennant's suggestion to create an original British Marvel war comic to compete with titles such as Warlord and Battle Picture Weekly. While no original material was commissioned the concept of a war comic found fruition as Fury which ran from March to August 1977 before merging with MWOM. It reprinted Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos and Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders.Wymann, Adrian. \\"The Mighty World of Bronze Age British Marvel (1972‚Äì1979) Part Two: 1975‚Äì1977 Expansion, Mergers - and Captain Britain!\\" The Thought Balloon (2012). Accessed August 2, 2012. Tenant left in 1977 and was replaced by Nick Laing. In early 1978, Laing oversaw the launch of Marvel UK's Star Wars Weekly title, soon after the film was released in the UK. The weekly issues split the stories from the US monthly issues into smaller installments, and it usually took three weekly issues to complete a US monthly issue. In May 1980 the title became known as The Empire Strikes Back Weekly, and in November 1980 it transformed into a monthly publication. Marvel UK's Star Wars comic also published original Star Wars stories by British creators as well as reprinting the US comics material. Many, but not all, of these original British stories were reprinted in the 1990s by Dark Horse Comics. The format changed back to a weekly in June 1983 with the adaptation of Return of the Jedi (which also became the new name of the publication), and remained so until its last issue in 1986. Prior to the Return of the Jedi comic, the strips in the UK Star Wars comics were printed in black and white, even those taken from the American color versions. The UK comics also reprinted several other supporting strips in each issue from other Marvel properties (such as The Micronauts, Tales of the Watcher, Star-Lord, etc.). While the comic was in a weekly format, the supporting strips often made up the bulk of each issue. = Skinn era (\\"The Marvel Revolution\\")= By the late 1970s, sales of Marvel UK titles had begun to fall and it was on a visit to the UK that Stan Lee headhunted Dez Skinn to revamp the ailing company. Knowing Skinn had significant experience in British comic publishing, Lee gave him freedom to do what he felt best. Skinn had his own catchphrase in \\"Dez Sez,\\" which was inspired by Lee's catchphrases from the 1960s.DezSkinn.com. Accessed June 20, 2011. Skinn set out to change Marvel UK as he saw fit, dubbing the changes \\"The Marvel Revolution\\".Dakin, John. \\"'Marvel Revolution' in England,\\" The Comics Journal #45 (March 1979), p. 14.\\"Marvel UK,\\" DezSkinn.com. Accessed June 20, 2011. Taking over in late 1978, the first major change he brought was to have original material produced by British creators. Many of these creators had already worked with Skinn on his title The House of Hammer a few years earlier, plus some new young talent. Skinn wrote: \\"[T]raditional British comics were at the time selling 150,000+ a week, firm sale, no returns. If Marvel and Spider-Man could look British enough for some of that to rub off, everybody would be happy ... But fixing the covers to resemble the non-glossy generic look of weekly anthology titles was one thing ... Having \\"splash\\" pages and then five or six frames a page just didn't stack up against Warlord, Action, Battle, and the rest with their nine to 12 a page.\\" So the US artwork was re-sized to fit several pages onto one and emulate the look of the more established UK boys' weeklies.DezSkinn.com. Accessed June 20, 2011. Skinn reasoned that Marvel superhero weeklies had been effectively competing with each other in an already crowded market. So while the Spider-Man Comic was to be the flagship superhero comic (with Thor, Iron Man, Avengers, Fantastic Four, and Nova), The Mighty World of Marvel was re-launched as Marvel Comic, in the tradition of UK boys' adventure titles. Dracula, Conan the Barbarian, and Skull the Slayer joined (or re-joined) established strips Daredevil and Hulk (although the Hulk was replaced three issues after the re-launch by Godzilla, as the Hulk left for his own title). The Hulk was a popular character ‚Äì Rampage Weekly which starred The Defenders had been added to Marvel's list of publications under Tennant's editorship as a second vehicle for the green giant ‚Äì and now with his own TV series Skinn saw the Hulk as the lead feature of another adventure style comic. Hulk Comic started out with originally produced Hulk stories by Steve Dillon, Paul Neary, and John Stokes, among others, which reflected the green-skinned behemoth as depicted on the TV. Skinn explained: \\"As with Marvel Comic, I was wanting an adventure anthology title more than a superhero one. Super-heroes had never been big sellers in the UK, we had plenty of legends of the past to spin fantasies about. So I went that route, picking existing Marvel characters who weren't really cut from the super-hero cloth.\\"DezSkinn.com. Accessed June 20, 2011. Originally produced stories were included, such as Nick Fury drawn by Steve Dillon, and Night Raven by Steve Parkhouse and David Lloyd. Also included was the Black Knight, a Marvel character revamped to take in Arthurian concepts, as well as feature the return of Captain Britain from comic book limbo. As well there was the usual US reprint material, such as Ant-Man and in later issues the Beast from Amazing Adventures, and even The Defenders were moved in from Rampage Monthly to increase the dose of Hulk action (a house ad showed a stern doctor holding out a handful of pills and saying, \\"Boredom is a sickness... and there's only one cure. More Hulk action!!!\\"). Arguably Skinn's most important decision was to launch Doctor Who Weekly in 1979. Based on the BBC TV series (which at that point had already been running for 16 years), Doctor Who Weekly featured original comics stories by John Wagner, Pat Mills, and Dave Gibbons, among many others, plus articles and features on the show itself. It proved a huge success, and by now Skinn had transformed Marvel UK back to being a major publisher of not just weekly comics but monthly titles such as Starburst. Starburst had been created by Skinn before he joined Marvel UK, but was purchased by Marvel when he joined the company. Skinn was not happy with how creators were treated in regard to ownership of characters, so he left Marvel UK in 1980 (eventually forming Quality Communications in 1982).  Pocket Books  In March 1980, as part of the \\"Marvel Revolution\\", Skinn launched the Marvel Pocket Books line with four 52-page titles. The line began with Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Star Heroes (featuring TV tie-in Battlestar Galactica and the toy-based strip the Micronauts continued from their previous run in Star Wars Weekly), and Chiller (starring Dracula and the Man-Thing with occasional appearance from other horror-related characters). Following Skinn's belief that much of Marvel's strongest material was that published in the 1960s and early 70s, many of these titles showcased strips from that period. Skinn drew on the design of the traditional UK Picture Library titles which boomed in the 1960s to establish a definitive look for the Pocket Books. Skinn wrote that they \\"emulated the look in their Combat Picture Library covers ... that was the look I wanted, to pull the line of pocket books together visually and make them different to any of our other titles ...\\" DezSkinn.com. Accessed June 20, 2011. The first four titles were later joined by Hulk, The Titans (reprinting the 1960s stories of Captain America, Thor and Iron Man), Marvel Classics Comics (featuring comic book adaptations of classic literature), Conan, and Young Romance. Some titles were not a success in terms of sales: Hulk, Conan, The Titans, Marvel Classics Comics, and Young Romance were cancelled after 13 issues, while Star Heroes (which had replaced The Micronauts with the original X-Men from issue #10) was re-launched as X-Men Pocket Book from #14. All other Pocket Books were cancelled after issue 28 in July/August 1982. The Hulk strips continued in a newly launched The Incredible Hulk Weekly and similarly the classic Fantastic Four strips resurfaced in a weekly title in October 1982. Both of these eventually folded into Spider-Man Comics Weekly, where the strips continued on and off until it changed into The Spider-Man Comic, aimed at younger readers. The classic Spider-Man material continued in the first few issues of The Daredevils. = 1980s = With Skinn's departure, Bernie Jaye took over as Marvel UK's editor-in-chief.Marvel UK entry, Who's Who of American Comics, 1928‚Äì1999. Accessed May 29, 2011. In September 1981 Captain Britain got his own strip in the pages of The Mighty World Of Marvel (by then firmly established as a monthly title under the name Marvel Superheroes), as written by Dave Thorpe and drawn by Alan Davis. (Thorpe left in 1982, to be replaced by Alan Moore in one of Moore's first major ongoing strips.) In October 1981, inspired by the success of its Doctor Who title, Marvel UK began publishing a monthly Blake's 7 title, edited by Stewart Wales. However, as the television series itself went off the air in late 1981, the magazine itself lasted less than two years. Despite a flurry of new weeklies post-Skinn (Forces in Combat, Marvel Team-Up, Future Tense and Valour), by 1982 Marvel UK moved mainly to monthly titles such as The Daredevils (featuring Moore and Davis's Captain Britain). However, many of Marvel UK's titles wouldn't last long before being combined or cancelled outright due to poor sales. Jaye left the company in 1983. In January 1985 the first issue of Captain Britain Monthly appeared with its titular strip written by Jamie Delano and drawn by Alan Davis. This title lasted 14 issues before cancellation and would prove to be Marvel UK's last major new title for several years. New material was still being produced, such as the Zoids stories (written by Grant Morrison) for Secret Wars and Spider- Man and Zoids, but not on the scale or diversity previously seen. For the remainder of the 1980s the company published only a small handful of titles that appealed to superhero fans, but had considerable success on the UK newsstands with licensed titles such as Care Bears, Lady Lovely Locks, The Real Ghostbusters, ThunderCats, Transformers and many others. These all featured original strips as well as some US reprints. Transformers, in particular, was a major seller for Marvel UK, selling 200,000 copies a week at its height. Its main writer, Simon Furman, would eventually take over the Marvel US version of the title as well, and continues to work on the franchise to this day, though it is no longer published by either branch of Marvel Comics. The Marvel UK Transformer series, running 332 issues, is, besides Bob Budiansky's run on the American comic, regarded as the most important collection of Transformers fiction. As such, Transformers remains one of Marvel UK's most important historical titles. (The Marvel UK Transformers series was reprinted by Titan Books in the 2000s with some omissions, notably all of the UK exclusive stories prior to issue 45. Although these have now been reprinted by IDW Publishing along with the rest of the weekly and Annual stories as part of The Transformers Classics UK collections.) From 1988, it was The Real Ghostbusters that became the top seller; it ran for 193 issues, four annuals, and a Slimer spinoff, and its characters were used to anchor several other titles like Wicked!. and The Marvel Bumper Comic. In 1988, Marvel UK letterer/designer Richard Starkings pushed for the company to publish its own US-format comics, beginning with Dragon's Claws and Death's Head (a spin-off character from Marvel UK's Transformers title). The Sleeze Brothers (1989‚Äì1990) was a creator-owned title by John Carnell and Andy Lanning. It was Steve White who launched the first critically acclaimed volume of Knights of Pendragon (1990‚Äì1991), written by Dan Abnett and John Tomlinson with art by Gary Erskine, which mixed superheroes and Arthurian myth. It also featured Captain Britain among many other Marvel Comics heroes, such as Iron Man. By 1990, Marvel had told its UK branch that long miniseries were too expensive and that it should produce four-issue minis (John Freeman recalled \\"some legal or distribution restriction in the US on publishing three-part mini series, which the company would have preferred\\") that would try out new characters. John Freeman and Dan Abnett first wanted to revive Death's Head, give a miniseris to Strip character Rourke, and spin off Doctor Who Magazine's Abslom Daak as an original character. This last one was dropped as Marvel felt Doctor Who was \\"a 'dead' franchise and there was no value to Marvel in seeking to extend a brand they did not themselves own\\". = Neary era = Paul Neary became Marvel UK editor-in-chief circa 1990, appointed to revamp the company and make another attempt at the US market. As a stop gap, he had two short- lived reprint titles created: Havoc and Meltdown (which reprinted Akira).Down the Tubes: \\"Genesis ‚Äô92‚Ä≥: Looking Back and What Might Have Been\\" The US-format titles began with Death's Head II, a recreation of Simon Furman's cyborg bounty hunter. The titles were set in the existing Marvel Universe but with more of a focus on cyberpunky science fiction and magic than the traditional superhero fare. Titles such as Warheads (wormhole-hopping mercenaries), Motormouth (later Motormouth and Killpower, a streetwise girl and escaped genetically modified super assassin hop around the universe having adventures) and a second volume of Knights of Pendragon. These were all linked by plots featuring the organization Mys-Tech, a shadowy group of Faustians bent on world domination. Some of these titles were also reprinted in the UK anthology Overkill. At some point during Neary's run but before the market crash, Marvel UK was running low on money. They requested an emergency meeting with Marvel Entertainment executives Bill Bevin and Terry Stewart to approve a ¬£1m last- ditch strategy. While they got the money, writer Sean Howe would later be told that Bevin was livid about being called to London for a mere one million, asking \\"why are you wasting my time?\\"Howe, Sean:Marvel Comics: The Untold Story (2012 Harper Perennial edition); page 354-5 - recounted as occurring before \\"late 1993\\" Neary instituted a deliberate policy to feature Marvel US guest-stars in the Marvel UK stories. However, they would only be featured on eleven pages, and these pages were designed to be able to cut from the main story; the eleven pages without the guest-star were run in Overkill. This policy was dropped after market research showed people expected to see superheroes in Marvel (\\"that included watching a group of teenagers rip Overkill apart from behind a two way mirror\\", according to Freeman). Where US Marvel characters were featured, all the storylines were approved by the American editor in charge of that book. Some were more responsive than others to the outlines, with editors such as Bobbi Chase offering useful feedback for Marvel UK's editors. Very few Marvel US comics referenced any of the original characters or major events that occurred within the Marvel UK comics, with an exception being The Incredible Hulk in August 1993.Incredible Hulk #408 and #409 Nevertheless, in the US, these comics were initially immensely successful, with some issues being reprinted to keep up with demand. Marvel UK massively expanded and trading cards were made of their characters. During this flush period, Tom DeFalco requested they make a new hero called Red Squirrel Man. An entire sub-imprint called Frontier Comics was created in 1993, patterning itself after DC's Vertigo Comics and Marvel UK even showed up at the Lord Mayor's Show in 1993, with staff members dressed as superheroes and Death's Head II. Despite a lineup that included Liam Sharp, Simon Coleby, Bryan Hitch, Carlos Pacheco, Graham Marks, Salvador Larroca, Dan Abnett and many others, too many titles were launched too quickly in a market which was already swamped by the early 1990s comics boom.\\"Life at Marvel UK,\\" Down the Tubes. Accessed May 28, 2011. In late 1993, Marvel UK would be devastated by the comics market glut and subsequent crash; in September 29, their new Director of Sales, Lou Bank, reported that they were being hurt by \\"inadequate display of product\\" at retail \\"[that] has hindered salethrough\\" and that it was failed there was \\"simply no room to display\\" all the comics being made.STARLOGGED reprinting Comic World #22, December 1993 Dark Guard, Cyberspace 3000, Wild Thing, Black Axe, Super Soldiers, and the entire Frontier imprint were cancelled. A large number of projects in the works, from those just proposed to some that had been solicited, were also cancelled. The Red Mist 20:20 crossover was killed so late that Roid Rage #1, a Super Soldiers spinoff, was cancelled while at the printers. Mark Harrison's Loose Cannons was cancelled shortly before it was meant to run (January 1994), despite being almost complete; was later put online by Harrison. Paul Neary told Comic World that this was a \\"trimming of fat\\" to allow Marvel UK to focus its marketing efforts on \\"our strongest characters\\" and claimed the cancelled projects would see the light of day in 1994. Two titles that did still run were spinoffs of Death's Head II in November, with house ads brashly comparing them to other popular comics as part of a marketing strategy to portray the new Marvel UK as a lean, hungry company that could hold its own against larger (and implicitly duller) competition. In 1994, Marvel UK had ceased publishing in the US market and was now only printing a handful of titles ‚Äî mostly reprints ‚Äî for the UK market, as well as licensed titles like the long-running Doctor Who Magazine. Death's Head II was cancelled at #16, of which distributor Capital only sold 7,400 copies. Various creators began looking elsewhere for work and Lou Banks left for Dark Horse. Neary planned a four- title relaunch of their US format line, including Nocturne (an updated Night Raven), The Golden Grenadier, and new titles for Captain Britain and Death's Head. (David Leach's proposal for Death's Head started as a Third Doctor joke, \\"that we should completely overhaul him, reduce his power, lose the time travel aspect and set it in present day England\\".) The Golden Grenadier would have been a 1950s superhero, a grenadier guardsman who worked for a secret organisation run by the Queen Mother. The launch never took place. Eventually, Nocturne and ClanDestine saw print in America while Wild Things (a Dark Angel/Wild Thing team-up) was published in Italy. = Panini takeover = With the failure of its US titles the company was folded into Marvel's Panini Comics business, who at the time was part of Marvel Europe, and had already been reprinting American material across Europe for several years. Casualties of the merger included editor-in-chief Paul Neary and managing director Vincent Conran. Thanks to this licensing deal, reprints of American Marvel Comics material continued to be published in the UK by Panini from the mid-1990s. They continued printing two existing Marvel UK titles Astonishing Spider-Man and Essential X-Men and followed the continuity of the US comics, however it was approximately two‚Äìthree years behind the current run in America. Each book contained approximately two or three Marvel US strips in one issue with possibly a \\"classic\\" comic printed as a substitute for a comic in the current run, whilst being priced at a reasonable level. In addition to this Panini continued Doctor Who Magazine. In addition to reprinting the mainstream US comics, Panini started publishing a monthly (later every three weeks) oversized comic, entitled The Spectacular Spider-Man, for younger readers to accompany Spider-Man: The Animated Series, which began broadcasting in the UK in the mid-1990s. Initially, the stories were simply reprints of the US comics based on the series, but eventually the title moved to all-new UK- originated stories, marking the first Marvel UK material featuring classic Marvel characters to be produced since early 1994. Eventually, the Marvel UK logo itself was dropped. One of the final comics to have it was a licensed Rugrats comic in May 1996.

The game is based on Ragnarok, showing the conflict between the Gods Odin and Loki and the buildup to Ragnarok. Built on the Unreal Engine, the game casts the player as Ragnar, a young Viking warrior whose mettle is tested when Loki and his evil allies plot to destroy the world and bring about Ragnarok. Upon release, Rune received generally positive reviews. A stand-alone expansion pack for the game, Rune: Halls of Valhalla, was released in 2001. Both the base game and expansion were ported to Linux by Loki Software. Ryan C. Gordon, a former Loki employee, would also later port Human Head's 2006 title Prey. A port to the PlayStation 2 was also released under the title Rune: Viking Warlord in 2001. The game was re-released digitally under the name Rune Classic in 2012, with the expansion included. A sequel, Rune II, released on November 12, 2019. A pen-and-paper adaptation of Rune was published by Atlas Games.  Gameplay  The game casts the player as Ragnar, a young Viking warrior. It follows a fantasy plot based on Norse mythology. The various enemies Ragnar faces include man-eating fish, goblins, zombies, Norse dwarves and other Vikings. As the game goes on, as in most games of its type, better weapons are accumulated. Late in the game the player wields weapons of enormous size, even though most weapons maintain their usefulness to the end. Runes are strewen around the game world. When collected, they add to the player's rune power. Weapons in Rune are divided into three categories: swords, axes, and maces/hammers. Each of the three classes have five weapons, increasing in size as the game progresses. Each weapon has a unique \\"Rune Power\\" that can be activated for a short period of time when the player has enough rune power. Shields may be equipped along with the first three weapons of each class. Weapons of tier 4 and 5 are two-handed, and may not be used along with shields. Besides these standard weapons, other items such as torches and severed limbs may also be equipped to be used as weapons. While high-tier weapons tend to be preferable in singleplayer games, all tiers are considered somewhat equal for multiplayer situations due to balancing factors such as speed. Depending on the direction of Ragnar's movement, weapons can be thrust, swung overhead, or slashed. Repeated strikes unleash a powerful spinning attack. All weapons may be thrown, and deal as much damage when thrown as a melee attack. When Ragnar has killed enough enemies in a short span of time, he enters a brief \\"Berserk Mode\\", which allows him to resist damage and hit harder. There is also a special rune which instantly activates Berserk Mode. Although rather linear, Ragnar does not need to kill everything in sight (common in games of the time) to travel from one level to the next. In some levels, players have found alternative ways of getting through to the next level. However, particular scripted pawns must be activated (killed, moved or tripped) in key zones to initiate certain actions to continue and move the story along. = Multiplayer = Rune features several multiplayer modes, typical for the time, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and so on. The expansion, Halls of Valhalla, added one unique mode, which is inspired by football; the players are split into team, and score points by dismembering players in the opposing team, picking up their body-parts, and throwing them into the goal. It is a game of spatial orientation in which opponents manoeuvre around each other, swinging in and out of range and attempting to score hits on each other. There are a variety of attacks available to the player at any one time, dictated by the weapon they hold at that moment. The geometries of each swing are immutable - thus players are able to fine tune their movement to the precision of a few pixels, and accurately behead their opponents. Over the years, Rune developed a thriving and competitive clan community, with players from all over the world joining servers, playing together, and forming clans.  Story  The story begins when the player, as Ragnar, is initiated into the Odinsblade, an order of warriors sworn to protect the runestones, magical creations of Odin which bind the evil god, Loki and prevent him from unleashing Ragnarok ‚Äì the end of the world. Ragnar has completed his initiation by beating the great warrior Ulf in combat, when a warrior bursts into the scene and informs the two that a Viking known as Conrack is leading a raid on an allied village. Ragnar and the rest of his village's warriors are assembled into a longship to do battle. They encounter Conrack's longship, and Ragnar's father is about to order his men to attack, when Conrack calls upon Loki and destroys the ship with a thunderbolt. The ship sinks, killing all on board but Ragnar, who receives a message from Odin that it is not his time to die. Recovered, he swims to safety in an underwater cave. Ragnar fights his way through the monster- riddled caverns. He eventually enters the land of the dead, domain of Loki's daughter Hel. Passing through the Underworld and facing the ghastly undead, Ragnar learns the enemy's plan: Conrack's carnage sends many dishonored souls to Hel's domain, who in turn gives them to Loki to transform into an army which will conquer the world. After fighting his way through Hel, Ragnar is captured by goblins and fights their beast in the trial pit. He defeats the beast and escapes goblin lands riding on a giant flying beetle. When he emerges from the caverns, he stands before Thorstadt, the mountain fortress of Conrack, and fights his way through it to a Temple of Loki. Inside, Sigurd ‚Äì Conrack's right arm ‚Äì confronts his master about all the destruction and asks him to drop the charade of worshipping Loki. Conrack states that Sigurd has outlived his usefulness, and sends two of the transformed dishonored to kill him, then escapes. Ragnar enters the scene and stands before the dying warrior. Sigurd informs Ragnar that he is the last of the Odinsblade, and saving the world is up to him, then dies. Ragnar follows Conrack, and ends up in the land of the Dwarves. In Rune, Dwarves are depicted as short, stocky, purple beings. He travels through the industrial powerhouse of the dwarven land and learns that the dwarves are supplying weaponry and armor for Loki's new sinister armies. Odin then tasks Ragnar to murder the dwarf king, whose will holds the dwarves' allegiance to Loki together. The king has apparently proclaimed himself a semi-god, and resides in a great temple dedicated to himself. Ragnar enters battle with the king, and he uses the great machine that gives the king his powers to destroy him. Ragnar travels deep below the earth and to the castle of Loki himself. Odin tells Ragnar that even he will not be able to contact him whilst he transverses through Loki's realm. Ragnar discovers that it is Loki's blood that transforms Hel's undead warriors to the monsters of Loki's armies. He passes through the castle and Loki's maze, arriving at the holding chamber of Loki himself. It is here Ragnar faces Conrack at last. Ragnar knocks the rogue Viking into a river of Loki's blood, which seems poised to kill him. However, the great stone snake which binds Loki drips acid onto his gaping chest wound and the green blood turns purple. Conrack rises out of the river, reborn in Loki's image as a hideous monster. Conrack reveals to Ragnar that Loki's armies are invading Midgard and destroying Odin's runestones left and right. He escapes with a great leap. After a tussle with some undead, Ragnar dives into the river, emerging as a mighty giant. Loki tries to persuade Ragnar to join his side. He refuses and goes after Conrack. He escapes from Loki's castle and makes his way through caverns out into the world above. He then stands witness to the devastation wrought by Loki's armies. Loki mocks him, but he presses on. His fellow warriors no longer recognize him, and attack him on sight. Ragnar finally arrives home, only to see it totally destroyed. Loki offers one last time to join him, and Conrack sends his men forward to destroy the runestone and Ragnar. There are two possible outcomes of the game, depending on what the player does here. In the canonical good ending, Ragnar bests Conrack and his men. Odin speaks to Ragnar, telling him that the people of his village are safe in the hands of his servant Bragi. He informs Ragnar that he has succeeded and Ragnarok has been averted. Loki, full of bitterness and rage, has his cave filled in by Odin, thwarted for the time being. Odin then opens up a portal in his last runestone, telling Ragnar to step through and join him at his side as the first living warrior to enter Asgard. Complying, Ragnar enters Odin's realm and finds himself restored to his human form. Beckoned by Odin, Ragnar runs over Bifr√∂st and enters the Halls of Valhalla. In the evil ending, Ragnar strides up the hill toward the last runestone and shatters it. As soon as this happens, Loki is freed from his underground prison. The last we see of Ragnar is that he is crucified in Loki's lair. Loki then takes over all of Midgard. Development The genesis of Rune occurred while Ted Halsted and Shane Gurno were working at Raven Software. Halsted, who had always been fascinated by Vikings, took inspiration from the Icelandic V√∂lsunga saga. Halsted, Gurno and four others left Raven to found Human Head Studios, and soon found work developing a sequel to Daikatana using the Unreal Engine. When that project fell through, the Viking idea was revived and work began on Rune with the publisher Gathering of Developers. Epic Games allowed Human Head to keep using the Unreal Engine originally licensed for the Daikatana project. The two developers collaboratively made several enhancements to it, including a skeletal animation system, a new particle effects system, and an enhanced shadowing system. Although made using the Unreal Engine, Rune is a third- person perspective game without any shooting. The weapons used in the game include swords, axes, maces, and other medieval fantasy melee weapons. Despite using an engine made for shooting, the interface lends itself well to a playing style consisting of running, jumping, and hacking at opponents. Although the game includes no ranged weapons, any weapon can be thrown. An innovative feature of the game is that anything dropped by a dead opponent (body parts included) can be picked up and used. Limbs can be swung as clubs, and heads can be carried and used as weapons. Enemies whose sword arms have been chopped off will run away from battle. Both Rune and Rune: Halls of Valhalla were released with their own RuneEd toolkits which the community quickly used making several popular multiplayer mods (coop, CTT‚Äîcapture the torch, 'bots, etc.). Although a few single player addons have been made, it is Rune's multiplayer aspect has been the focus of several mutators, skins, and hundreds of maps that are available through many clan and resource websites. In 2004, the source header files were released freely by Human Head. Release Rune shipped for Windows on October 27, 2000. A playable demo was released at the same time. The Mac OS version followed in December 2000 and Loki Software released the Linux port in June 2001. In October 2001, Rune was re-released with the HOV expansion included, as Rune Gold. A Dreamcast port of the game was cancelled. Human Head Studios would also feature new multiplayer levels for Rune online. A pen-and-paper adaptation was released by Atlas Games, whom Tim Gerritsen had approached at GenCon.  Reception  Erik from oldmanmurray.com summarizes by saying, \\"Shame on you, Human Head.\\" In the United States, Rune sold 49,000 copies by October 2001. Jim Preston reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Rune fails to impress. The shaky gameplay undermines the first-rate visuals and ripping good story.\\" The original PC version of Rune received generally positive reviews. Rune currently holds a rating of 76 out of 100 at the review aggregator website Metacritic, as well as a score of 77% at GameRankings. Critics generally thought the game was good, but not great, and required the player to adjust their expectations. A common point of criticism was the enemy artificial intelligence. Opponents would simply gang up on the player without bothering to use tactics. Enemy variety was also found wanting. Praise was however given to the graphics, especially the crisp textures, and the detailed limb-hacking violence was appreciated. The multiplayer was thought middling. Although many appreciated the cathartic fun of running around lopping the heads off other players, the lack of game modes and problems with lag interfered with the enjoyment. The PlayStation 2 port was criticized for inferior graphics to the original and long loading times. Whatever their opinion of the multiplayer on PC, critics disliked the multiplayer on PS2. Jim Preston reviewed the PlayStation 2 version Rune: Viking Warlords for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Another disc on the already enormous heap of mediocre PS2 games.\\"  Expansion and PS2 version  The Rune multiplayer component was expanded with the 2001 release of the stand-alone expansion pack Rune: Halls of Valhalla. HOV adds two new modes: \\"Head Ball\\" is a variant of capture the flag with body parts standing in for flags; \\"Arena\\" is a duel-centric deathmatch mode. The developers drew inspiration from the violent sport of the Aztecs, in which the losing team of a ball game was decapitated. 37 new maps in total are included: 20 for deathmatch, 8 for Head Ball, and 9 for Arena. Some of these maps were the winners of a four-week competition for fans of the game to create their own maps using the level editor. Sixteen new character models are available, some of them female. The Wren Valkyrie model is based on a fan of Rune who ended up getting hired as site director of the official Rune website. The soundtrack is also expanded. IGN did not like HOV very much. Rune: Viking Warlord is the PlayStation 2 port of Rune, released in 2001 by Take-Two Interactive. It contains a few extra maps and enemies, but is otherwise a straight port. Sequel Human Head was considering a sequel as early as 2000. Rune 2 had during the early-to-mid-2000s been negotiated with an unnamed publisher. In 2012, Human Head Studios indicated that it was considering making a sequel to Rune. A sequel titled Rune: Ragnarok was announced to be in production by Human Head in August 2017. In March 2018, the Ragnarok subtitle was dropped and the title was renamed Rune. By May 2019, Human Head renamed the title again as Rune II, with a target release for Windows in mid-2019 through the Epic Games Store. The partnership with Epic Games enabled Human Head to acquire additional funding to finish out their more expansive version of the game, according to studio head Chris Rhinehart. The game was pushed back and was released on November 12, 2019 under publisher Ragnarok Game LLC. Immediately after the game's release, Human Head Studios was shuttered and a new studio, Roundhouse Studios, was formed with the staff of Human Head Studios under management with Bethesda Softworks. Ragnarok stated they were unaware of Human Head's closure until that day but remained committed to providing ongoing support and releases outside Epic Games Store through 2020. By December 2019, Ragnarok had filed a lawsuit against the former Human Head staff for failing to provide the final source code and assets for Rune II following the studio's surprise closure upon their request, as well as in damages relating to the poor state in which Rune II was released at launch and to cover the game's post-launch support period which Human Head was to have done. Ragnarok had received the source code back from the former Human Head staff by January 2020, but still intend to follow through with the lawsuit.

This improves the material's mechanical properties and workability. The HIP process subjects a component to both elevated temperature and isostatic gas pressure in a high pressure containment vessel. The pressurizing gas most widely used is argon. An inert gas is used so that the material does not chemically react. The chamber is heated, causing the pressure inside the vessel to increase. Many systems use associated gas pumping to achieve the necessary pressure level. Pressure is applied to the material from all directions (hence the term \\"isostatic\\"). For processing castings, metal powders can also be turned to compact solids by this method, the inert gas is applied between and , with being most common. Process soak temperatures range from for aluminium castings to for nickel-based superalloys. When castings are treated with HIP, the simultaneous application of heat and pressure eliminates internal voids and microporosity through a combination of plastic deformation, creep, and diffusion bonding; this process improves fatigue resistance of the component. Primary applications are the reduction of microshrinkage, the consolidation of powder metals, ceramic composites and metal cladding. Hot isostatic pressing is thus also used as part of a sintering (powder metallurgy) process and for fabrication of metal matrix composites, often being used for postprocessing in additive manufacturing.

One type frequently discussed is when expansionary fiscal policy reduces investment spending by the private sector. The government spending is \\"crowding out\\" investment because it is demanding more loanable funds and thus causing increased interest rates and therefore reducing investment spending. This basic analysis has been broadened to multiple channels that might leave total output little changed or even smaller.‚Ä¢ Olivier Jean Blanchard (2008). \\"crowding out,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Abstract. ‚Ä¢ Roger W. Spencer & William P. Yohe, 1970. \\"The 'Crowding Out' of Private Expenditures by Fiscal Policy Actions,\\" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, October, pp. 12-24 Other economists use \\"crowding out\\" to refer to government providing a service or good that would otherwise be a business opportunity for private industry, and be subject only to the economic forces seen in voluntary exchange. Behavioral economists and other social scientists also use \\"crowding out\\" to describe a downside of solutions based on private exchange: the crowding out of intrinsic motivation and prosocial norms in response to the financial incentives of voluntary market exchange. History The idea of the crowding out effect, though not the term itself, has been discussed since at least the 18th century.Michael Hudson, ‚ÄúHow economic theory came to ignore the role of debt‚Äù, real-world economics review, issue no. 57, 6 September 2011, pp. 2‚Äì24, comments, cited at bottom of page 5 Economic historian Jim Tomlinson wrote in 2010: \\"All major economic crises in twentieth century Britain have reignited simmering debates about the impact of public sector expansion on economic performance. From the 'Geddes Axe' after the First World War, through John Maynard Keynes' attack on the 'Treasury View' in the interwar years, down to the 'monetarist' assaults on the public sector of the 1970s and 1980s, it has been alleged that public sector growth in itself, but especially if funded by state borrowing, has detrimental effects on the national economy.\\" Much of the debate in the 1970s was based on the assumption of a fixed supply of savings within a single country, but with the global capital markets of the 21st century \\"...international capital mobility completely undermines a simple model of crowding out\\".History and Policy.org- Jim Tomlinson-Crowding Out-December 5, 2010  Crowding out from government borrowing  One channel of crowding out is a reduction in private investment that occurs because of an increase in government borrowing. If an increase in government spending and/or a decrease in tax revenues leads to a deficit that is financed by increased borrowing, then the borrowing can increase interest rates, leading to a reduction in private investment. There is some controversy in modern macroeconomics on the subject, as different schools of economic thought differ on how households and financial markets would react to more government borrowing under various circumstances. The extent to which crowding out occurs depends on the economic situation. If the economy is at capacity or full employment, then the government suddenly increasing its budget deficit (e.g., via stimulus programs) could create competition with the private sector for scarce funds available for investment, resulting in an increase in interest rates and reduced private investment or consumption. Thus the effect of the stimulus is offset by the effect of crowding out. On the other hand, if the economy is below capacity and there is a surplus of funds available for investment, an increase in the government's deficit does not result in competition with the private sector. In this scenario, the stimulus program would be much more effective. In sum, changing the government's budget deficit has a stronger impact on GDP when the economy is below capacity. In the aftermath of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the U.S. economy remained well below capacity and there was a large surplus of funds available for investment, so increasing the budget deficit put funds to use that would otherwise have been idle. The macroeconomic theory behind crowding out provides some useful intuition. What happens is that an increase in the demand for loanable funds by the government (e.g. due to a deficit) shifts the loanable funds demand curve rightwards and upwards, increasing the real interest rate. A higher real interest rate increases the opportunity cost of borrowing money, decreasing the amount of interest-sensitive expenditures such as investment and consumption. Thus, the government has \\"crowded out\\" investment. The IS curve moves to the right, causing higher interest rates (i) and expansion in the \\"real\\" economy (real GDP, or Y). =What factors determine how much crowding out takes place?= The extent to which interest rate adjustments dampen the output expansion induced by increased government spending is determined by: *Income increases more than interest rates increase if the LM (Liquidity preference‚ÄîMoney supply) curve is flatter. *Income increases less than interest rates increase if the IS (Investment‚ÄîSaving) curve is flatter. *Income and interest rates increase more the larger the multiplier, thus, the larger the horizontal shift in the IS curve. In each case, the extent of crowding out is greater the more interest rate increases when government spending rises. Economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson wrote in June 2012: \\"By itself an increase in the deficit, either in the form of an increase in government spending or a reduction in taxes, causes an increase in demand. But how this affects output, employment and growth depends on what happens to interest rates. When the economy is operating near capacity, government borrowing to finance an increase in the deficit causes interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates reduce or ‚Äúcrowd out‚Äù private investment, and this reduces growth. The ‚Äúcrowding out‚Äù argument explains why large and sustained government deficits take a toll on growth; they reduce capital formation. But this argument rests on how government deficits affect interest rates, and the relationship between government deficits and interest rates varies. When there is considerable excess capacity, an increase in government borrowing to finance an increase in the deficit does not lead to higher interest rates and does not crowd out private investment. Instead, the higher demand resulting from the increase in the deficit bolsters employment and output directly, and the resulting increase in income and economic activity in turn encourages or 'crowds in' additional private spending. The crowding-in argument is the right one for current economic conditions.\\" =Two extreme cases= Liquidity trap If the economy is in a hypothesized liquidity trap, the \\"Liquidity- Money\\" (LM) curve is horizontal, an increase in government spending has its full multiplier effect on the equilibrium income. There is no change in the interest associated with the change in government spending, thus no investment spending cut off. Therefore, there is no dampening of the effects of increased government spending on income. If the demand for money is very sensitive to interest rates, so that the LM curve is almost horizontal, fiscal policy changes have a relatively large effect on output, while monetary policy changes have little effect on the equilibrium output. So, if the LM curve is horizontal, monetary policy has no impact on the equilibrium of the economy and the fiscal policy has a maximal effect. The Classical Case and crowding out If the LM curve is vertical, then an increase in government spending has no effect on the equilibrium income and only increases the interest rates. If the demand for money is not related to the interest rate, as the vertical LM curve implies, then there is a unique level of income at which the money market is in equilibrium. Thus, with a vertical LM curve, an increase in government spending cannot change the equilibrium income and only raises the equilibrium interest rates. But if government spending is higher and the output is unchanged, there must be an offsetting reduction in private spending. In this case, the increase in interest rates crowds out an amount of private spending equal to increase in government spending. Thus, there is full crowding out if LM is vertical. Crowding out sources If increased borrowing leads to higher interest rates by creating a greater demand for money and loanable funds and hence a higher \\"price\\" (ceteris paribus), the private sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, will likely reduce investment due to a lower rate of return. This is the investment that is crowded out. The weakening of fixed investment and other interest-sensitive expenditure counteracts to varying extents the expansionary effect of government deficits. More importantly, a fall in fixed investment by business can hurt long-term economic growth of the supply side, i.e., the growth of potential output. Thus, the situation in which borrowing may lead to crowding out is that companies would like to expand productive capacity, but, because of high interest rates, cannot borrow funds with which to do so. According to American economist Jared Bernstein, writing in 2011, this scenario is \\"not a plausible story with excess capacity, the Fed funds [interest] rate at zero, and companies sitting on cash that they could invest with if they saw good reasons to do so.\\" Another American economist, Paul Krugman, pointed out that, after the beginning of the recession in 2008, the federal government's borrowing increased by hundreds of billions of dollars, leading to warnings about crowding out, but instead interest rates had actually fallen. When aggregate demand is low, government spending tends to expand the market for private-sector products through the fiscal multiplier and thus stimulates ‚Äì or \\"crowds in\\" ‚Äì fixed investment (via the \\"accelerator effect\\"). This accelerator effect is most important when business suffers from unused industrial capacity, i.e., during a serious recession or a depression. Crowding out can, in principle, be avoided if the deficit is financed by simply printing money, but this carries concerns of accelerating inflation. Chartalist and Post-Keynesian economists question the crowding out thesis because government bonds sales have the actual effect of lowering short-term interest rates, not raising them, since the rate for short-term debt is always set by central banks. Additionally, private credit is not constrained by any \\"amount of funds\\" or \\"money supply\\" or similar concept. Rather, banks lend to any credit-worthy customer, constrained by their capitalization level and risk regulations. The resulting loan creates a deposit simultaneously, increasing the amount of endogenous money at that time. Crowding out is most plausibly effective when an economy is already at potential output or full employment. Then the government's expansionary fiscal policy encourages increased prices, which lead to an increased demand for money. This in turn leads to higher interest rates (ceteris paribus) and crowds out interest-sensitive spending. At potential output, businesses are in no need of markets, so that there is no room for an accelerator effect. More directly, if the economy stays at full employment gross domestic product, any increase in government purchases shifts resources away from the private sector. This phenomenon is sometimes called \\"real\\" crowding out. Crowding out of another sort (often referred to as international crowding out) may occur due to the prevalence of floating exchange rates, as demonstrated by the Mundell-Fleming model. Government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, which attract inflows of money on the capital account from foreign financial markets into the domestic currency (i.e., into assets denominated in that currency). Under floating exchange rates, that leads to appreciation of the exchange rate and thus the \\"crowding out\\" of domestic exports (which become more expensive to those using foreign currency). This counteracts the demand-promoting effects of government deficits but has no obvious negative effect on long-term economic growth. Crowding out demand In terms of health economics, \\"crowding-out\\" refers to the phenomenon whereby new or expanded programs meant to cover the uninsured have the effect of prompting those already enrolled in private insurance to switch to the new program. This effect was seen, for example, in expansions to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in the late 1990s. Therefore, high takeup rates for new or expanded programs do not merely represent the previously uninsured, but also represent those who may have been forced to shift their health insurance from the private to the public sector. As a result of these shifts, it can be projected that healthcare improvements as a result of policy change may not be as robust. In the context of the CHIP debate, this assumption was challenged by projections produced by the Congressional Budget Office, which \\"scored\\" all versions of the CHIP reauthorization and included in those scores the best assumptions available regarding the impacts of increased funding for these programs. CBO assumed that many already eligible children would become enrolled as a result of the new funding and policies in CHIP reauthorization, but that some would be eligible for private insurance. The vast majority, even in states with enrollments of those above twice the poverty line (around $40,000 for a family of four), did not have access to age-appropriate health insurance for their children. New Jersey, supposedly the model for profligacy in SCHIP with eligibility that stretched to 350% of the federal poverty level, testified that it could identify 14% crowd-out in its CHIP program. In the context of CHIP and Medicaid, many children are eligible but not enrolled. Thus, in comparison to Medicare, which allows for near \\"auto-enrollment\\" for those over 64, children's caregivers may be required to fill out 17-page forms, produce multiple consecutive pay stubs, re-apply at more than yearly intervals and even conduct face-to-face interviews to prove the eligibility of the child. These anti-crowd-out procedures can fracture care for children, sever the connection to their medical home and lead to worse health outcomes. Crowding out supply Crowding out is also said to occur in charitable giving when government public policy inserts itself into roles that had traditionally been private voluntary charity. Crowding out has also been observed in the area of venture capital, suggesting that government involvement in financing commercial enterprises crowds out private finance.

He was praised for his gallantry in the Seven Days Battles and the Battle of Antietam, but was demoted for insubordination after the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg. As chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland, he achieved recognition by restoring a supply line that saved that army from starvation and surrender, known as the \\"Cracker Line\\", that helped Union troops to success in the Chattanooga Campaign in the autumn of 1863. Leading the first operation against Petersburg, Smith's hesitation, possibly illness-related, cost the Union a prime opportunity for a quick end to the war, and he was relieved of command. Early life Smith, known to his friends as \\"Baldy\\", was born at St. Albans, Vermont, the son of Ashbel and Sarah Butler Smith, and a cousin of J. Gregory Smith (governor of Vermont, 1863-1865). He was educated locally in Vermont until he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1841, and graduated four years later standing fourth of 41 cadets. Smith was appointed a brevet second lieutenant on July 1, 1845, and was assigned to the Topographical Engineers Corps. He was promoted to second lieutenant on July 14, 1849, and promoted to first lieutenant on March 3, 1853.Eicher, p. 500. During his service in the Corps, Smith conducted surveys of the Great Lakes, the states of Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as well as much of Mexico. While serving in Florida, Smith was stricken with the infectious disease malaria. Although he would recover at the time, the illness affected his physical health for the rest of his life. In 1856 Smith began his involvement in the lighthouse service, which was headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, and eventually rose to become the Engineer Secretary of the Lighthouse Board. Smith was also twice assistant professor of mathematics at West Point (1846-48 and 1855-56). He was promoted to captain on July 1, 1859. Civil War During the First Battle of Bull Run, Smith served on the staff of Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell. On August 13, 1861, he was appointed a brigadier general in the Union Army after helping organize the 1st Vermont Brigade. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his gallantry at the Battle of White Oak Swamp in the Seven Days Battles. On July 4, 1862, he received promotion to the rank of major general in the Union Army. Smith led his division with conspicuous valor during the Battle of Antietam, and was again brevetted in the regular army. When his corps commander, Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, was reassigned to a superior command, Smith was placed at the head of the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac, which he led at the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg. The recriminations that followed Fredericksburg led to a famous general order in which army commander Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside proposed to dismiss several of the senior officers of the army. President Abraham Lincoln prevented this order from taking effect and relieved Burnside of his command instead. Smith was one of the affected officers, but it is to his credit that he did not leave the Army. However, his indiscretion in communicating to Lincoln directly about Burnside's shortcomings, compounded by the fact that Smith was a close friend of out-of-favor Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, resulted in his losing both his corps command and his rank; the Senate failed to confirm his nomination to major general, which expired on March 4, 1863. Reverting to the rank of brigadier general, he commanded a division-sized force of militia within the Department of the Susquehanna in Pennsylvania during the critical days of the Gettysburg Campaign, repelling Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at a skirmish in Carlisle. Smith's green troops then participated in the unsuccessful pursuit of Gen. Robert E. Lee back to the Potomac River. He followed this in division command in West Virginia. On October 3, 1863, Smith was assigned to duty as chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland (and a couple of weeks later, the Military Division of the Mississippi). As such he conducted the engineer operations and launched the Battle of Brown's Ferry, which opened the \\"Cracker Line\\" to provide supplies and reinforcements to the besieged troops in Chattanooga. Of this action the House Committee on Military Affairs reported in 1865 that \\"as a subordinate, General WF Smith had saved the Army of the Cumberland from capture, and afterwards directed it to victory.\\" Smith was now again nominated for the rank of major general of volunteers, and Ulysses S. Grant, who was much impressed with Smith's work, insisted strongly that the nomination should be confirmed, which was accordingly done by the Senate on March 9, 1864. Grant, according to his own statement \\"was not long in finding out that the objections to Smith's promotion were well grounded,\\" but he never said what the grounds were, while Smith, contributing to a major series of war memoirs,Johnson, Robert Underwood, and Clarence C. Buel, eds. Battles and Leaders of the Civil War. 4 vols. New York: Century Co., 1884-1888. maintained that they were purely of a personal character. General William Farrar Smith and staff For the Overland Campaign of 1864, Smith was assigned by Grant to command the XVIII Corps in Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's Army of the James, which he led in the Battle of Cold Harbor and the first operations against Petersburg. Smith's corps and a division of black troops (under Edward W. Hinks) were ordered to take the city. Remembering the debacle at Cold Harbor, Smith performed exhaustive reconnaissance. Determining that the section of the defensive line was manned primarily by artillery, he ordered an attack. However, the attack was delayed and in the meantime he became apprehensive about a rumor circulating that Lee was about to arrive. He lost his nerve, perhaps because of the formidable character of the Confederate works or perhaps because of a recurring bout with malaria, but his hesitation may have lost him the opportunity to shorten the war by nearly a year. On July 19, 1864, he was relieved from command of the XVIII Corps and he spent the remainder of the war on \\"special duty.\\" Postbellum career Smith resigned from the volunteer service in 1865, and from the U.S. Army in 1867. From 1864 to 1873 he was president of the International Telegraph Company, and from 1875 to 1881 served on the board of police commissioners of New York City, becoming its president in 1877. After 1881 he was engaged in civil engineering work in Pennsylvania. He died at Philadelphia in 1903 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His Autobiography of Major General William F.

His scholarly work was directed to the study of runic inscriptions and Norse philology. Bugge is best known for his theories and his work on the runic alphabet and the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda.Sophus Bugge ‚Äì utdypning (Store norske leksikon) Background Elseus Sophus Bugge was born in Larvik, in Vestfold county, Norway. His ancestors had been merchants, ship owners and captains of the Larvik for several generations. Bugge was a cand.mag. (1857) and research fellow in comparative linguistics and Sanskrit (1860). He was educated in Christiania, Copenhagen and Berlin. Career In 1866 he became professor of comparative philology, comparative Indo-European linguistics and Old Norse at Christiania University now the University of Oslo. In addition to collecting Norwegian folksongs and traditions and writing on Runic inscriptions, he made considerable contributions to the study of the Celtic, Romance, Oscan, Umbrian and Etruscan languages. His scientific work was of fundamental importance for the Norse philology and runic research. In his 1880 work Studies about the origin of Nordic mythological and heroic tales, Bugge theorized that nearly all myths in Old Norse literature derive from Christian and late classical concepts. Bugge's theories were generally vehemently rejected, but have had some influence. Bugge was the author of a very large number of books on philology and folklore. His principal work, a critical edition of the Poetic Edda (Norr≈ìn Fornkv√¶√∞i), was published at Christiania in 1867. He maintained that the Eddic poems and the earlier sagas were largely founded on Christian and Latin tradition imported into Scandinavian literature by way of England. His writings also include Gamle Norske Folkeviser (1858), a collection of Old Norse folk-songs; Bidrag til den √¶ldste skaldedigtnings historie (Christiania, 1894); Helge-digtene i den √Üldre Edda (Copenhagen, 1896, Eng. trans., The Home of the Eddic Poems, 1899); Norsk Sagafort√¶lling og Sagaskrivning i Island (Christiania, 1901), and various books on runic inscriptions.Sophus Bugge (Store norske leksikon) Dating from 1902, Bugge's vision was so poor that he could no longer read. Professor and linguist Magnus Olsen, who was Bugge's assistant and his successor, would read and describe new discoveries of inscriptions. Bugge's final works regarding original rune scripture were not completed before he died. They were released between 1910 and 1913 through the efforts of Professor Olsen.Magnus Olsen (Store norske leksikon) Honors Bugge was a member of the Scientific Society of Christiania (now The Norwegian Academy of Science) from 1858 (vice president 1884), The Royal Norwegian Scientific Society in Trondheim (1865) and a number of foreign societies. He was made honorary doctor at Uppsala University in 1877. He was appointed a Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1877, Commander Grand Cross 1890 and 1896. Personal life Bugge was married during 1869 to Karen Sophie Schreiner (1835‚Äì1897). His son Alexander Bugge became a noted historian.

The city of Schwelm was officially established in 1496 and became seat of the Ennepe- Ruhr district in 1929. According to its area, Schwelm is the smallest town in North Rhine-Westphalia. Additional information on the history of Schwelm is available on the City of Schwelm website. Language/dialect A Westphalian variety of high German is spoken in Schwelm (Westphalian: from old Saxon Westfal = \\"western land\\"). The Westphalian dialect belongs to the low Saxon dialects, which is a part of the family of low German dialects. Compared to other German regions (e.g., Bavaria or Swabia) the dialect does not have a strong influence on the everyday speech. Especially the elderly population is still able to speak Schwelm's original Westphalian tongue, called Schwelmer Platt, which is quite different from standard high German and bears a certain resemblance to Dutch. Points of interest Schwelm has got a historical town center with many old houses, some of which date back to the 18th century. The Altmarkt is a historical market place lying in front of the tall Christuskirche, the town's principal Protestant church. From the Altmarkt, the decorative street K√∂lner Strasse leads uphill and is part of the former road to Cologne. Until 2011, Schwelm was home to the Brauerei Schwelm, the \\"Schwelm Brewery\\", one of few remaining private breweries in North Rhine-Westphalia. Established in 1830 by Haarmann & Kathagen, the brewery was one of the first worldwide to switch from wooden to metal storage containers. The original administration building, the Rietz'sche Haus built in 1701, is an appealing house in the town center. Most of the brewery's historic production site, however, was torn down in 2012. The oldest piano manufacturer in the world is located in Schwelm. Since 1794, Rud. Ibach Sohn has been building pianos and, until 1904, organs in Schwelm. Europe's biggest fair-trade organisation \\"GEPA\\" was founded in Schwelm in the 1970s, but is now located in Wuppertal. A historical Jewish cemetery, dating from the late 18th century is located in the countryside about 1.3 km south of the town's center. It is maintained by the municipality and volunteers.Helbeck, Gerd: Juden in Schwelm. 1st ed. 1988, 2nd ed. 2007 (written by a renowned town archivist and printed by the local Historical Society, the book includes a chapter on the cemetery) Notable citizens Gustav Heinemann in 1969 * Friedrich Christoph M√ºller (1751 in Allendorf (Lumda) - 1808): theologian and cartographer (in Schwelm between 1785 and 1808) * Friedrich Springorum (1858-1938), engineer and entrepreneur * Wilhelm G√∂cke (1898‚Äì1944), Nazi SS concentration camp commandant * Gustav Heinemann (1899-1976): third president of the Federal Republic of Germany (from 1969 to 1974) * Johannes Joachim Degenhardt (1926-2002): Cardinal and archbishop of Paderborn * Franz Josef Degenhardt (1931-2011): political singer/songwriter * Martin Gr√∂tschel (born 1948): mathematician and laureate of the Leibniz price * Rolf R√ºssmann (1950-2009): footballer and football manager * Torsten Schmidt (born 1972): racing cyclist and participant of the Tour de France * Olivia Spiker (born 1981): Polish-German amateur boxer *Dr. Kurt Israel Herz (born 1879): German-Jewish doctor and philanthropist.

He played as a left back and was a regular fixture in Netherlands national football team. He is currently the team manager for the Netherlands B squad and a scout for AZ Alkmaar. Club career =Early career= Born in Heemskerk, North Holland, Numan started his career with the amateur club SV Beverwijk and was spotted by Haarlem, who handed him his first professional game against DS '79 on 26 March 1988 which his team won 2‚Äì0. He originally played in a more attacking role, but his long-time mentor Dick Advocaat, then the coach of Haarlem, positioned him as a left fullback. =Twente and PSV= Numan joined Twente at the close of the 1990‚Äì91 season where he scored goals even as a defender. He was named team captain for the Enschede team and also captained the Dutch Under 21 national team. However, it was not until he joined PSV Eindhoven that his talents were fully appreciated. He was drafted into the Dutch team for a World Cup qualifying game against Poland which ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw on 14 October 1992. Numan was substituted after forty minutes by Advocaat, who was then the national team coach and brought on PSV teammate Gerald Vanenburg as his team was 2‚Äì0 down early in the game. =Rangers= A ¬£4.5 million deal took him to Rangers in May 1998, but Numan's time in Scotland was then blighted by injuries that forced him to sit out many games. Dick Advocaat, who managed the team at that time, waited for Numan to recover, a move which was rewarded when he helped the team to considerable league success as well as the treble in his first and final season at Rangers. Numan was awarded the teams vice-captaincy serving as deputy to captain Lorenzo Amoruso. He had a particularly prolific relationship with German international left sided midfielder Jorg Albertz. However, at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, he and the club could not agree a new contract so he left at the end of that season. He stated that he was willing to accept a pay-cut offer but felt that his club wanted too large a drop in wages. He soon announced his retirement. A late offer by Villarreal failed to change his mind and he refused to continue his career in Holland. He was not looking forward to start afresh training and playing hectic games every week. International career Numan was included in the squad for the 1994 World Cup in the United States, although he was never included in the starting line-up for any of the matches. His World Cup debut came against the Ireland as a substitute in the 75th minute. He was also selected for Euro 1996, yet also failed to start a match at the tournament. Numan was chosen to captain the team. He featured in most of the qualification games for the 1998 World Cup. Numan played in all of the group matches in France, although the quarter final game against Argentina was marred with his second yellow card of the game (after a tackle on Diego Simeone). He missed the crucial clash with eventual finalist Brazil. He played in the third placing match against Croatia, but could not help his team win the bronze medal. Numan continued to feature in the Dutch national team, representing his country on home soil during the Euro 2000 tournament. By 2000, Numan's career at the international stage appeared to wane and his automatic leftback spot was open to his contenders Winston Bogarde and Giovanni van Bronckhorst. He was to play for the remaining games of his team's failed attempt to capture their first major trophy since 1988 culminating in the semi-final loss to Italy on penalties. He was determined to assist his national team to qualify for the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan under manager Louis van Gaal but the crucial game against Ireland at Landsdowne Road stadium in late 2001 was lost 1‚Äì0. He retired from international football after his final international game against United States on 19 May 2002, which the Dutch won 2‚Äì0 away. Managing career Numan was a regular pundit on Scotsport SPL, Scottish and Grampian TV's round-up of Scottish Premier League action and remained in Hamilton for a few years after his retirement. He was also appointed treasurer of the Rangers Charity Trust. He has taken up the position of team manager for the Netherlands B squad in December 2008. Numan signed a one-year contract with Aston Villa to become their scout in the Netherlands and surrounding areas in mid-2011. Currently, he works as a scout for Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar on a part-time basis.

Originally, whistle-stop appearances were made from the open platform of an observation car or a private railroad car. Definition and usage The definition of the term derives from the practice of a small, occasionally used railway station signaling a train so the engineer will know to stop. Trains inbound to a \\"whistle stop\\" station would signal their approach with a blast of the train's steam whistle which would alert the train depot attendant to their arrival. If passengers, mail, or freight waited to be picked up at the depot, the depot master would raise a tower signal to indicate to the train engineer that the train should stop. If no stop was necessary, a different signal would be raised and the engineer could pass through the depot without a stop.Citation needed One usage of the term in the political context, by Robert A. Taft, was derisive. He accused then-President Harry S. Truman of \\"blackguarding Congress at whistle stops across the country\\".Truman by David McCullough Use of the term has spread to cover any travel done very quickly and with only brief pauses. It is common to hear this expression in the United States, where the term originated, as well as the United Kingdom. Background In the 19th century, when travel by railroad was the most common means of traveling long distances over the vast expanses of land as in the United States, politicians would charter tour trains which would travel from town to town. At each stop, the candidate would make a speech from the train, but might rarely set foot on the ground. \\"Whistle stop\\" campaign speeches would be made from the rear platform of a train. One of the most famous railroad cars to be used in the U.S. whistle- stop tours was the Ferdinand Magellan, the only car custom built for the President of the United States in the 20th century. Originally built in 1928 by the Pullman Company and officially the \\"U.S. No. 1 Presidential Railcar\\", the Ferdinand Magellan is currently on display at the Gold Coast Railroad Museum in Miami, Florida. The famous news photo of Harry S Truman holding up a copy of the Chicago Tribune with a banner headline stating \\"Dewey Defeats Truman\\" was taken on this platform on Wednesday, November 3, 1948, at St. Louis Union Station. The Ferdinand Magellan was also used by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and, to a much lesser extent, by President Dwight Eisenhower. The Magellan‚Äôs last official trip before retirement was in 1954, when first lady Mamie Eisenhower rode it from Washington, D.C., to Groton, Connecticut, to christen the world‚Äôs first nuclear-powered submarine, the . President Ronald Reagan used the Magellan for one day, October 12, 1984, traveling 120 miles in Ohio, from Dayton to Perrysburg, making five stops to give \\"whistle stop\\" speeches along the way. Modern whistle-stop tours Prince Charles of the United Kingdom started a five-day whistle-stop tour of the United Kingdom on Monday 6 September 2010 with a speech in Glasgow. The green campaigning tour is a part of the Prince's Start initiative that aims to build public awareness of sustainable activities. Indeed in Europe, touring politicians still occasionally take a train, as the excellent and still dense railway network offers access comparable to road travel and as it is better suited for extensive trips than air travel. In 2009 for example German chancellor (and CDU candidate) Angela Merkel made a highly publicized tour in Konrad Adenauer's old campaign train.http://www.zeit.de/2009/38/Merkel-Zug The SPD on the other hand only discontinued the use of train tours for campaign purposes ahead of the 1998 election.http://www.focus.de/magazin/archiv/periskop-kein- wahlkampfzug_aid_169949.html During both the 2016 and 2020 election campaigns, Donald Trump employed the whistle-stop concept by holding rallies at rented airport hangars. In 2016 this allowed for an increased cadence of speaking appearances, as many as 3-4 a day, while in 2020 it circumvented some of the public gathering constraints imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic. In late September 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden campaign had a train tour of Ohio and Western Pennsylvania.

[Mattis Kantor, \\"The Jewish Timeline Encyclopedia,\\" (1989: Jason Aronson, Inc., NJ), p.83] between the Maccabee forces of Judea, led by Judah Maccabee, and the third expedition of the Seleucid Empire forces under Antiochus IV Epiphanes to Lysias. The generals for the expedition were Gorgias, Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor.Machabeus 1 ch 3 verse 38  Battle  Gorgias established his base camp at the town of Emmaus, along the western border of Judea, while Judah Maccabee's camp was located in the town of Mitzpah, north of Jerusalem. Word reached Maccabee that Gorgias was leading 5,000 troops on a march against his camp and was planning to surprise the Jewish rebels in a night-time attack. Judah abandoned his camp and led his forces to Emmaus, to attack the expedition base camp that remained there. Gorgias found the camp at Mizpah empty and deserted, and believing Judah and his army had fled, began a search for them in the surrounding area. The forces led by Judah lacked swords and armor for many of its soldiers. Arriving at the camp at Emmaus, Judah saw that the enemy had no such problem. The camp was heavily fortified and was surrounded by well-trained heavy cavalry. Judah Maccabee organized his men into units resembling a regular army, with units of 10, 50, 100, and 1,000. They set up a fortified camp on the south side of Emmaus. Judah addressed his men, urging them to fight valiantly, \\"for it is better for us to die in battle than to see the evils of our nation, and of the holy places. Nevertheless, as it shall be the will of God in heaven, so be it done.\\" Though he spoke these words, Judah Maccabee was seeking victory, not death and glory through martyrdom. With the Seleucid forces defeated, Judah's army pursued them in their flight, harrying the rear until almost 3,000 were left dead. Gorgias returned to Emmaus, only to find his camp destroyed with the rebel army in possession of the camp and in position against his troops. Gorgias did not give battle after the destruction of his base, but fled to the coastal plains with Judah pursuing his army. It was considered one of Judah Maccabee's most important victories in the war for Judean independence.

Fort Pitt was a fort built by British forces between 1759 and 1761 during the French and Indian War at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers, where the Ohio River is formed in western Pennsylvania (modern day Pittsburgh). It was near (but not directly on) the site of Fort Duquesne, a French colonial fort built in 1754 as tensions increased between Great Britain and France in both Europe and North America. The French destroyed Fort Duquesne in 1758 when they retreated under British attack. British colonial protection of this area ultimately led to the development of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania by British-American colonists and immigrants. Location and construction Artist's interpretation of Fort Pitt in 1759, with Allegheny (left) and Monongahela rivers. At their confluence is the Ohio River (bottom) In April 1754, the French began building Fort Duquesne on the site of the small British Fort Prince George at the beginning of the French and Indian War (AKA Seven Years' War). The Braddock expedition, a 1755 British attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with defeat at the Battle of the Monongahela at present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania. The French garrison later defeated an attacking British regiment in September 1758 at the Battle of Fort Duquesne. French Colonel de Lignery ordered Fort Duquesne destroyed and abandoned at the approach of General John Forbes' expedition in late November. A number of factors contributed to this strategic withdrawal. In August of 1758 the French Fort Frontenac, at the head of Lake Ontario, was captured by British Gen. Bradstreet, severing the supply lines to French fortifications across the frontier. Fort Duquesne was the southernmost of these. Short on materiel, French commander Fran√ßois-Marie Le Marchand de Lignery was forced to dismiss elements under his command down the Ohio River to their bases in Illinois and Louisiana, and send others overland north to Ft. Presque Isle. Those Native who may have remained at Fort Duquesne were likely eager to return to their winter longhouses before the weather changed. Consequently, the fort was further undermanned, possibly left with as few as 200 regulars. The late October Treaty of Easton with several Native tribes involved in the war largely dissolved the alliance that had enabled French military dominance in the region. Chiefs of 13 American Indian nations agreed to negotiate peace with the colonial governments of Pennsylvania and New Jersey and to abandon any alliances with the French. The nations were primarily the Six Nations of the Iroquois League, bands of the Lenape (Delaware), and the Shawnee. They agreed to the treaty based on the colonial governments' promising to respect their rights to hunting and territory in the Ohio Country, to prohibit establishing new settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains, and to withdraw British and colonial military troops after the war. The French commander, anticipating an attack along Braddock‚Äôs road, had spent some effort fortifying positions there. (Forbes had several times advanced men along that route as a feint.) From prisoners captured during Maj. James Grant‚Äôs catastrophic attack on Fort Duquesne, de Lignery was reportedly surprised to learn of a fortified encampment of British troops only 100 miles away at Ligonier, Pennsylvania, with substantial reserves behind. He was also certainly cognizant of the British lightening raid on the Native village of Kittaning (40 miles north on the Allegheny River) two years earlier. Thus, a British attack from the north was a distinct possibility. Forbes had indeed contemplated an attack further north on Fort Machault (later, Ft. Venango; modern-day Franklin, PA.) Finding himself in an under-manned, flood-prone fort in a weak defensive position, vulnerable to attack from three directions, and running low on provisions, de Lignery retreated north. He destroyed the stores and many of the structures as 1500 advance British troops under the command of Forbes drew within 10 miles. The French never returned to the region. The British built a new fort and named it Fort Pitt, after William Pitt the Elder. The fort was built from 1759 to 1761 during the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), next to the site of former Fort Duquesne. It was built in the popular pentagram shape, with bastions at the star points, by Captain Harry Gordon, a British Engineer in the 60th Royal American Regiment. Pittsburgh Waste Book and Fort Pitt Trading Post Papers, 1757-1765, DAR.1925.03, The Darlington Collection, Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh. Pontiac's War The Fort Pitt Blockhouse, constructed in 1764 After the colonial war and in the face of continued broken treaties, broken promises and encroachment by the Europeans, in 1763 the western Lenape and Shawnee took part in a Native uprising known as Pontiac's War, an effort to drive settlers out of the Native American territory. The American Indians' siege of Fort Pitt began on June 22, 1763, but they found it too well- fortified to be taken by force. In negotiations during the siege, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the commander of Fort Pitt, gave two Delaware emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox. The potential of this act to cause an epidemic among the American Indians was clearly understood. Commander William Trent wrote that he hoped \\"it will have the desired effect.\\" Colonel Henry Bouquet, leading a relief force, would discuss similar tactics with Commander-in-Chief Jeffery Amherst. The effectiveness of these attempts to spread the disease are unknown, although it is known that the method used is inefficient compared to respiratory transmission, and it is difficult to differentiate from naturally occurring epidemics resulting from previous contacts with colonists. During and after Pontiac's War, epidemics of smallpox among Native Americans devastated the tribes of Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes areas. On August 1, 1763, most of the American Indians broke off the siege to intercept the approaching force under Colonel Bouquet. In the Battle of Bushy Run, Bouquet fought off the American Indian attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 10. In 1772, after Pontiac's War, the British commander at Fort Pitt sold the building to two colonists, William Thompson and Alexander Ross. At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by the colonies of both Virginia and Pennsylvania, which struggled for power over the region. After Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, they called it Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia's Governor Lord Dunmore. The fort served as a staging ground in Dunmore's War of 1774. American Revolutionary War During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Pitt served as a headquarters for the western theatre of the war. In 1778, Sampson Mathews, George Clymer, and Samuel Washington were sent as representatives for the United States Congress to the western frontier to report on security of the American border. Congress had learned of British governor Henry Hamilton's efforts to pit local Indian tribes against the lightly guarded American western border, and feared attack. From Fort Pitt, the committee reported back to Congress the seriousness of the threat, leading Congress to send 3,000 militiamen to the western frontier,Pieper, Thomas, and Gidney, James (1980).

Used for many years as a private residence, the blockhouse was purchased and preserved for many years by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Notice was given to area residents of an auction of all salvageable remains of the fort on August 3, 1797 after the U.S. Army decommissioned the site. In the 20th century, the city of Pittsburgh commissioned archeological excavation of the foundations of Fort Pitt. Afterward, some of the fort was reconstructed to give visitors at Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section, the Fort Pitt Museum is housed in the Monongahela Bastion, and excavated portions of the fort were filled in.

Umbrella branding is mainly used by companies with a positive brand equity (value of a brand in a certain marketplace). All products use the same means of identification and lack additional brand names or symbols etc. This marketing practice differs from brand extension in that umbrella branding involves the marketing of similar products, rather than differentiated products, under one brand name. Hence, umbrella branding may be considered as a type of brand extension. The practice of umbrella branding does not disallow a firm to implement different branding approaches for different product lines (e.g. brand extension).  Family branding strategy  Marketers may increase the chance of success for a new product launch by using a sub-brand name and a parent brand name simultaneously. In the article by Howard Pong Yuen LAM and other co-authors, they report the successful case of using two brand names‚Äîdual branding strategy‚Äîby practitioners in China for the Minute Maid Orange Pulp juice drink launch. \\"A suggestive sub-brand name helps consumers recall the key benefits and features of the new product. A suggestive parent brand name communicates the benefits of the product category. A dual branding strategy addresses the problem of using only one brand name for a new product launch. After the successful launch of the first new product by a parent brand, marketers are able to launch other new products under other sub-brand names in the future to meet different consumer needs. Marketers may use the same parent brand to introduce different products to build scale for the brand, and are able to clearly differentiate the different product offerings under different subbrand names. If a company acquires a brand from another company, a marketer may position the acquired brand as a sub-brand under the parent brand if the marketer has defined the business scope of the parent brand broadly enough and with a suggestive parent brand name.\\" Axe (by 258x258px  Purpose  Umbrella Branding is used to provide uniformity to certain product lines by grouping them under a single brand name, making them more easily identifiable and hence enhancing their marketability. All products under the same corporate umbrella (masterbrand providing structure and credibility to other products of the corporation) are expected to have uniform quality and user experience (e.g. All products carrying the parent brand must be of the same high quality standards). Factors that may determine the impact of umbrella branding include: # The degree of commonality among the products falling under the corporate umbrella (e.g. Whether the products may act as substitutes for each other). # The brand equity of a corporation (e.g. Whether the brand is known in its product market).  Theories  Various theories attempt to explain a consumer's decisions and judgements during product purchasing that cause umbrella branding to be a successful marketing strategy. = Categorisation theory = The categorisation theory is based upon the notion that consumers tend to categorise products by associating them to brands and their past experiences with those particular brands (stored in their category memory) in order to evade the initial confusion caused by the extensive choice of products they are presented with. New information on certain products are categorised into various sections such as product class (e.g. beverage) and brand (e.g. Coca-Cola) and then stored. Afterwards, consumers evaluate the product quality through past experiences with the brand's products as well as the brand equity. This theory also explains for the popularity of umbrella branding. Consumers tend to evaluate new products not only by positive brand equity but also if the brand's concept is consistent with their extended products. For instance, assuming that the consumer had satisfactory past experiences with the company's products, if Apple Inc. would develop and sell a new version of a Macbook, consumers would deem it more reliable and potentially of superior quality rather than if Apple would produce a new beverage due to Apple's past product line. = Schema congruity theory = The schema congruity theory suggests that the storage of new information and retrieval of memory is majorly influenced by past expectations. Schemas are a human's personal cognitive representations of the environment that guide their perceptions, thoughts and actions. Schemas go through constant change as a human experiences and learns new information. Nonetheless, the new information is firstly evaluated on the basis of existing schemas. Relating the theory to consumer evaluation of products, a consumer already possesses pre-existing schemas from past experiences with certain brands and therefore new products are evaluated based on the existing schema the consumer has with the certain brand. This theory is quite similar to the categorisation theory; however, the schema congruity theory places emphasis on the consumer's past experiences with the brand which is influenced by the surrounding environment. = Confirmation bias = Confirmation bias is a form of statistical bias, describing the tendency to seek for or interpret evidence in ways that support one's existing beliefs. After a consumer creates a preference of one brand over others, any additional feature that may be common between various brands will most likely only strengthen the consumer's pre- existing preference, causing them to disregard other brands. Hence, a positive brand equity may not be as influential if a consumer already has a pre- existing brand preference.  Benefits  Umbrella branding has become a popular marketing practice utilised by companies due to its various potential benefits. Such marketing practice may create advertising efficiencies through the reduced costs of brand development. This strategy reduces a firm's marketing costs due to the consumer-brand association through which consumers already recognise certain brands, making new products more easily identifiable. Consequently, the market entry for umbrella branded products is relatively inexpensive since reputable brands can take advantage of past marketing efforts. Furthermore, a company benefits from advertising efficiencies since umbrella branding focuses on the promotion of a single brand rather, than multiple ones. For instance, Apple Inc. adds new products (e.g. Macbook Pro, Apple Watch) to their line and benefits from past marketing since consumers use previous information to make an inference about a product with the same brand name, allowing Apple to focus on promoting the corporate brand, rather than multiple individual brands. Additionally, the use of umbrella branding does not prevent companies from implementing other methods of brand extension, enabling them to remain flexible with marketing strategies. Finally, the success of one umbrella branded product may translate to other products under the same corporate umbrella due to the positive brand equity.  Risks  A major risk of utilising umbrella branding is that it may result unsuccessful in promoting new products if the company does not have a strong brand equity. Secondly, the consumer's experience with one umbrella branded product may affect their perception of other products and services falling under the same corporate umbrella as well as the brand itself. Consequently, if one umbrella branded product does not satisfy the consumer's expectations, the other products sold under the same brand are also likely to suffer. Thus, the company might result in a negative brand equity (also known as brand equity dilution). Thirdly, umbrella branding is only beneficial when promoting relatable products through which consumers could recognise the brand. For instance, the Starbucks brand is associated to coffee-related products and therefore consumers would mainly recognise the brand on products related to the specific market. Lastly, cannibalisation (reduction in sales volume due to the introduction of a new product by the same company) may result when related products are introduced under the same corporate brand as internal product competition will lead to consumers choosing between products from the same brand, stunting future investment into product creation of the same product line under the corporate umbrella.  Popular Usage  Starbucks Corporation, Virgin Group, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Apple Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company are examples of multinational companies that use umbrella branding in some of their product lines. = Starbucks Corporation = Starbucks Corporation (operating as Starbucks coffee) is an American multinational coffee company, which markets all of their products under their corporate brand name. Some products produced by Starbucks include: * Starbucks Coffee ** Various types of coffees. * Starbucks Tea ** Various types of teas. * Starbucks Drink-ware ** Various types of drink-ware such as cups, mugs and tumblers. * Starbucks Equipment ** Various types of equipment such as coffee machines. * Starbucks Syrups and Toppings ** Various types of syrups and toppings. = Virgin Group = Virgin Group Ltd. is a British multinational branded investment corporation. Virgin is one of the world's most recognised brands, which has used various types of brand extensions, including umbrella branding. Virgin has 33 branches that operate under the Virgin name; however, the practice of umbrella branding is observed in their industry-specific brands (e.g. Virgin Drinks, which was a subsidiary of Virgin Group that marketed Virgin Cola and Virgin Vodka) including: Virgin Group Ltd. Corporate brand logo. * Virgin Green Fund * Virgin Atlantic * Virgin Books * Virgin Games * Virgin Vacations * Virgin Spa * Virgin Life Care * Virgin Earth * Virgin Money * Virgin Media * Virgin Mobile View full list here = Procter & Gamble = Procter & Gamble (also known as P&G;) is an American multinational corporation, providing a range of consumer products. Although P & G create individual product brands (e.g. Pampers or Pantene), umbrella branding is implemented within the individual brands. Some individual brands owned by P & G include: Procter & Gamble corporate logo. * Pantene ** Brand of haircare products, including shampoos, dry shampoos, conditioners, moistures, hair- styling products and others. *Oral-B **Brand of oral-hygiene products such as toothbrushes, toothpastes, dental floss and mouthwashes. *Gillette **Brand of men's safety razors and other personal care products such as shaving gels, foams, skin care, deodorants and shower gels. *Vicks **Brand of over-the- counter medication including medication for cold & flu, cough relief, sinus relief and occasional sleeplessness. P & G create individual brands for different product lines and then implement umbrella branding within those brands in order to control profitable market sections. This strategy allows P & G to abstain from the risk of damaging the corporate brand's image from the release of an unsuccessful product, as the brands are not interconnected. = Unilever = Unilever is a British-Dutch multinational company providing various consumer goods. Similar to Procter & Gamble, Unilever implements umbrella branding within the individual brands it creates including: * Axe/Lynx ** Brand of male grooming products such as: deodorants, shower gels, body wash, shampoos, conditioners and hair stylers. * Dove ** Brand of personal care products for males and females such as: antiperspirants/deodorants, body washes, lotions, facial and hair care products. * Lux ** Brand manufacturing a range of personal hygiene products including: shower gels, shampoos, conditioners, beauty soaps, perfumes and bath additives. * Ben & Jerry's ** Company/brand that manufactures ice cream, frozen yogurt and sorbet. = Apple Inc. = Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology corporation that develops and sells a range of consumer electronic goods and services. Apple Inc. market all their products under their corporate brand name including: Apple Inc. Corporate brand logo. * Macintosh ** Line of personal computers developed by Apple Inc. * iPhone ** Line of smartphones developed by Apple Inc. * iPad ** Line of tablet computers developed by Apple Inc. * iPod ** Line of portable media-players developed by Apple Inc. * Apple Watch ** Smart-watch developed by Apple Inc. = The Coca- Cola Company = The Coca-Cola Company is a multinational corporation manufacturing various beverages. The corporation also implements umbrella branding within the individual brands for various flavored beverages including: The Coca-Cola Company Corporate brand logo. * Coca-Cola ** Brand of carbonated soft-drinks that are manufactured in different variants such as: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Coca-Cola Zero and Coca-Cola Life. * Fanta ** Brand of fruit-flavored carbonated soft-drinks that are manufactured in different variants, with the most popular flavors being: Fanta Orange, Fanta Orange Zero, Fanta Lemon, Fanta Lemon Zero and Fanta Fruit Twist (view full list here). * Minute Maid ** Brand of various fruit beverages, including 100 different fruit juices. Other companies that have implemented umbrella branding in their marketing strategy include: Nivea (German personal- care brand), Marriott (hospitality company) and FedEx (Global courier delivery corporation).

The group formed in 1990 in the city of Norrk√∂ping and released their first album in 1992. Their name is derived from the Babylonian god Marduk, patron deity of Babylon. History Marduk was formed by Morgan Steinmeyer H√•kansson in order to form the \\"most blasphemous band in the world\\". Their musical style was that of a straightforward death metal influenced take on black metal music, but as the years progressed their style and imagery became more of a fast and intense form of black metal.York, William \\"[ Marduk Biography]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation Marduk's predominant lyrical topics are Satanism, anti-Christianity, blasphemy, death, Third Reich history, and World War II. The latter two are a later addition to their lyrical/conceptual themes, stemming from their 1999 release Panzer Division Marduk. Marduk have recorded further songs relating to those chapters of human history, such as \\"The Hangman of Prague\\" (moniker of Reinhard Heydrich ‚Äî second in command of the SS ‚Äî in his capacity as the de facto Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia), \\"Night of the Long Knives\\", \\"Deathmarch\\" and others. On the Nightwing album the band samples a march by the fascist and anti-semitic Iron Guard in Romania.Album: Nightwing. Sample: final song, outro The band's fixation on Nazi-era Germany has caused a great deal of controversy, leading to multiple performances being cancelled, and leaving the band unable to tour multiple countries in various parts of the world. Much of this controversy stems from a 1995 interview with Nordic Vision Magazine, in which guitarist Morgan Steinmeyer H√•kansson was quoted as saying \\"in Germany, where magazines as ‚ÄúRock Hard‚Äù and ‚ÄúMetal Hammer‚Äù have decided that we are a facistic [sic] band and refuse to print any ads with Marduk [‚Ä¶] the reason for this is that in a German magazine I said that we in Marduk want to prevent immigration to Sweden and that I was proud over the fact that my grandfather was a serving German officer during the second World War‚Äù and that ‚Äúimmigrants ‚Äì who poison our environment‚Äù should not be allowed into Sweden. In September 2016, The band was supposed to tour the U.S. with Carach Angren, Rotting Christ, and Necronomicon but was forced to drop out, leaving the other three to continue on, due to unresolved delays in obtaining visas. Due to that, the band was forced to postpone the tour to early 2017. In late February their planned Oakland show was cancelled by the venue for fears of security issues after a local anti-fascist group targeted the band and reportedly threatened the venue staff. In April 2018 vocalist Mortuus and drummer Fredrik Widigs were accused of purchasing items from the Nordic Resistance Movement (NMR), a Swedish neo-Nazi organization, after sale records for various purchases were uncovered, including Mortuus and Widigs' real names, personal email addresses, and shipment records confirmed the material was shipped to the members' home addresses. The items included stickers and flyers promoting the NMR and the books \\"Our Way - The Nordic Party Movement Party Program\\" and \\"National Socialism - The Biological Worldview\\". Marduk denied these claims on their official Facebook page stating, \\"No Marduk member has ordered anything from the website in question, or ever had any form of interaction with the organisation operating it. This is all we have to say about the matter.\\" On 26 April 2018 the band released their first single \\"Werwolf\\" off their latest album Viktoria which was released on 22 June.

Early life Campbell was born in London. His father, Ronald George Elidor Campbell (1848-1879), was the second son of the 2nd Earl Cawdor and an army captain, was killed at the Battle of Hlobane in the Zulu War in 1879. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before entering the Coldstream Guards in 1896. He served through the Second Boer War, in which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and twice mentioned in despatches. First World War Campbell was 39 years old, and a temporary lieutenant colonel commanding the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 15 September 1916 at Ginchy, France, during the Battle of the Somme, Lieutenant Colonel Campbell took personal command of the third line when the first two waves of his battalion had been decimated by machine-gun and rifle fire. He rallied his men and led them against the enemy machine-guns, capturing the guns and killing the personnel. Later in the day he again rallied the survivors of his battalion and led them through very heavy hostile fire. His personal gallantry and initiative at a very critical moment enabled the division to press on and capture objectives of the highest tactical importance.

The central tower and blockhouse are now demolished Chatham Dockyard and Fort Amherst from Fort Pitt, view to north, 1831 Fort Pitt is a Napoleonic era fort on the high ground of the boundary between Chatham and Rochester, Kent. A fort on the site was proposed in the 1790s, and finally built between 1805 and 1819. Not finally used as a fort, it became a hospital and is now a girls' grammar school. History =The original fort= Named after Prime Minister William Pitt, Fort Pitt was part of the defences overlooking the River Medway. Fort Clarence, Fort Amherst and the Great Lines were visible from Fort Pitt, the whole providing a defensive ring to protect Chatham Dockyard. Fort Pitt was laid out with red-brick walls with a bastion at each corner, and was surrounded by a deep defensive trench. The original fort included a number of buildings now demolished, including a central tower, or keep, removed in 1910 to provide more hospital space; a large blockhouse designed to house 500 men; and two outlying towers, one on each flank, named 'Delce' and 'Gibraltar'.Howard, pp. 3-5. In 1879 Gibraltar Tower was demolished, while Delce Tower, by then a ruin, was probably demolished shortly afterwards. The blockhouse was demolished in the early 1930s. =The hospital= The end of the Napoleonic Wars meant that the site was not finally used as a fort, although soldiers were sometimes accommodated there including, in 1815, wounded from the Battle of Waterloo. In 1828 it became a depot for invalided soldiers and a formal military hospital from 1832. An \\"asylum for insane soldiers\\" was added in 1847. By the 1850s, Fort Pitt was a major military hospital, with most of the soldiers invalided to Britain from abroad assessed there prior to their discharge. This included most of the sick and wounded from the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. Queen Victoria came to Fort Pitt on three separate occasions in 1855 to visit soldiers wounded in the Crimea.Howard, pp. 6‚Äì12. In 1860 Fort Pitt was selected by Florence Nightingale as the initial site for the new Army Medical School, before this moved to Netley near Southampton in 1863.A E W Miles, The Accidental Birth of Military Medicine, page 118. Civic Books, London, 2009 Continuing as a garrison hospital, in October 1914 King George V and Queen Mary visited, meeting servicemen wounded in the First World War, including five German Naval officers held in a separate ward. At least seventy German prisoners were treated at the Fort. On recovery, they were held in the Blockhouse until the end of the war. The hospital finally closed in 1919. =The school and today= In 1929 the Chatham Education Board bought the vacant Fort Pitt from the War Office, and the site was converted into a Girls' Technical School. The school, now known as Fort Pitt Grammar School, remains on the site and has added a number of new buildings.Howard, p. 22. The neighbouring University for the Creative Arts building occupies the old blockhouse site and some of the original brickwork remains visible at the sides of the building. The site continues to be of national historical significance. The Music House (the former 'insane asylum') in the school grounds and the ‚ÄúCrimea Wing‚Äù teaching block are listed buildings, with some of the old hospital ward numbers still visible on the Crimea Wing's walls. Several other buildings date to the period of use as a hospital and possibly earlier, although part of the old hospital building was destroyed in a fire in 1973.Howard, pp. 30‚Äì33. Much of the outer walls of the fort survive including parts of the outer defences which extend into the adjacent recreation grounds to the east and west. Military cemetery The Fort Pitt Military Cemetery, created initially to serve the hospital, lies a quarter of a mile to the south of the fort by the A229 road from Rochester to Maidstone. The graves, dating from the mid-nineteen century onwards,Howard, pp. 13-14. include 290 of Commonwealth service personnel from the World Wars, 265 from World War I, who lie in an extensive plot, and 25 from World War II who are mainly buried in a group north of that plot.Commonwealth War Graves Commission: Fort Pitt Military Cemetery.

A soldier with the Royal Irish Fusiliers during the First World War, he was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on 1 July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. Early life Cather was born in Streatham Hill, south-west London, on 11 October 1890 to R. G. Cather, who worked for the tea merchant company Joseph Tetley & Co., and his wife Margaret . His mother was the sister of the politician David Graham Shillington. He was educated at Hazelwood School in Limpsfield before going onto Rugby School. His schooling was curtailed in his mid-teens by the death of his father. He went to work for his late father's company, Joseph Tetley & Co. He spent much of the period from 1911 to 1914 in the United States and Canada on business. First World War On 3 September 1914, Cather enlisted in the British Army's Artists Rifles. He already had some military experience, having served for two years in the Territorial Force with the 19th Royal Fusiliers from 1909 to early 1911. The following May, he requested a transfer to the Royal Irish Fusiliers on account of his parents both being from Northern Ireland. He was accordingly granted a commission in the 9th Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers, which was part of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Sent to the French sector of the Western Front in October 1915, Cather was soon promoted to lieutenant and became adjutant of the battalion. The following July, the 36th Division took part in the Battle of the Somme. On 1 July 1916, the opening day of the battle, Cather's battalion was tasked with capturing Beaucourt Station, near Beaumont-Hamel. However there were heavy casualties amongst 9th Battalion and the adjacent 12th Battalion, and the Irish had to return to their starting positions leaving behind many wounded in no man's land. That night, Cather went out to locate and bring in wounded. He was able to retrieve three men before retiring for the night. The next morning he went out again to locate more survivors but was killed by machinegun fire. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read as follows: Originally buried near where he was killed, Cather's grave was later lost. His name is listed on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing, which was established near Thiepval in Picardy. A plaque to his memory is on the walls of the main building of Hazelwood School, which he attended in his youth and he is listed on the Royal Fusiliers Regimental Memorial in St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast. Victoria Cross King George V presented Cather's VC to his mother on 31 March 1917, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He was also entitled to the 1914‚Äì15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. His VC and other medals were later donated by his brother to the Royal Irish Fusiliers Museum in Armagh, Northern Ireland.

The short rate Under a short rate model, the stochastic state variable is taken to be the instantaneous spot rate.Short rate models, Prof. Andrew Lesniewski, NYU The short rate, r_t ,, then, is the (continuously compounded, annualized) interest rate at which an entity can borrow money for an infinitesimally short period of time from time t. Specifying the current short rate does not specify the entire yield curve. However, no-arbitrage arguments show that, under some fairly relaxed technical conditions, if we model the evolution of r_t , as a stochastic process under a risk-neutral measure Q, then the price at time t of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time T with a payoff of 1 is given by : P(t,T) = operatorname{E}^Qleft[left. exp{left(-int_t^T r_s, dsright) } right mathcal{F}_t right], where mathcal{F} is the natural filtration for the process. The interest rates implied by the zero coupon bonds form a yield curve, or more precisely, a zero curve. Thus, specifying a model for the short rate specifies future bond prices. This means that instantaneous forward rates are also specified by the usual formula : f(t,T) = - frac{partial}{partial T} ln(P(t,T)). Particular short-rate models Throughout this section W_t, represents a standard Brownian motion under a risk-neutral probability measure and dW_t, its differential. Where the model is lognormal, a variable X_t is assumed to follow an Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process and r_t , is assumed to follow r_t = exp{X_t},. =One-factor short-rate models= Following are the one-factor models, where a single stochastic factor ‚Äì the short rate ‚Äì determines the future evolution of all interest rates. Other than Rendleman‚ÄìBartter and Ho‚ÄìLee, which do not capture the mean reversion of interest rates, these models can be thought of as specific cases of Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck processes. The Vasicek, Rendleman‚ÄìBartter and CIR models have only a finite number of free parameters and so it is not possible to specify these parameter values in such a way that the model coincides with observed market prices (\\"calibration\\"). This problem is overcome by allowing the parameters to vary deterministically with time.An Overview of Interest-Rate Option Models , Prof. Farshid Jamshidian, University of TwenteContinuous-Time Short Rate Models , Prof Martin Haugh, Columbia University In this way, Ho-Lee and subsequent models can be calibrated to market data, meaning that these can exactly return the price of bonds comprising the yield curve.

Simon Benninga and Zvi Wiener. or simulation; see Lattice model (finance)#Interest rate derivatives and Monte Carlo methods for option pricing. #Merton's model (1973) explains the short rate as r_t = r_{0}+at+sigma W^{*}_{t}: where W^{*}_{t} is a one-dimensional Brownian motion under the spot martingale measure. #The Vasicek model (1977) models the short rate as dr_t = (theta-alpha r_t),dt + sigma , dW_t; it is often written dr_t = a(b-r_t), dt + sigma , dW_t. #The Rendleman‚ÄìBartter model (1980) explains the short rate as dr_t = theta r_t, dt + sigma r_t, dW_t. #The Cox‚ÄìIngersoll‚ÄìRoss model (1985) supposes dr_t = (theta-alpha r_t),dt + sqrt{r_t},sigma, dW_t, it is often written dr_t = a(b-r_t), dt + sqrt{r_t},sigma, dW_t. The sigma sqrt{r_t} factor precludes (generally) the possibility of negative interest rates. #The Ho‚ÄìLee model (1986) models the short rate as dr_t = theta_t, dt + sigma, dW_t. #The Hull‚ÄìWhite model (1990)‚Äîalso called the extended Vasicek model‚Äîposits dr_t = (theta_t-alpha r_t),dt + sigma_t , dW_t. In many presentations one or more of the parameters theta, alpha and sigma are not time-dependent. The model may also be applied as lognormal. Lattice-based implementation is usually trinomial. # The Black‚ÄìDerman‚ÄìToy model (1990) has dln(r) = [theta_t + frac{sigma '_t}{sigma_t}ln(r)]dt + sigma_t, dW_t for time- dependent short rate volatility and dln(r) = theta_t, dt + sigma , dW_t otherwise; the model is lognormal. #The Black‚ÄìKarasinski model (1991), which is lognormal, has dln(r) = [theta_t-phi_t ln(r)] , dt + sigma_t, dW_t . The model may be seen as the lognormal application of Hull‚ÄìWhite;Short Rate Models, Professor Ser-Huang Poon, Manchester Business School its lattice-based implementation is similarly trinomial (binomial requiring varying time-steps). #The Kalotay‚ÄìWilliams‚ÄìFabozzi model (1993) has the short rate as d ln(r_t) = theta_t, dt + sigma, dW_t, a lognormal analogue to the Ho‚ÄìLee model, and a special case of the Black‚ÄìDerman‚ÄìToy model. This approach is effectively similar to ‚Äúthe original Salomon Brothers model\\" (1987), also a lognormal variant on Ho-Lee.See pg 218 in =Multi-factor short-rate models= Besides the above one-factor models, there are also multi-factor models of the short rate, among them the best known are the Longstaff and Schwartz two factor model and the Chen three factor model (also called \\"stochastic mean and stochastic volatility model\\"). Note that for the purposes of risk management, \\"to create realistic interest rate simulations\\", these multi-factor short-rate models are sometimes preferred over One-factor models, as they produce scenarios which are, in general, better \\"consistent with actual yield curve movements\\".Pitfalls in Asset and Liability Management: One Factor Term Structure Models, Dr. Donald R. van Deventer, Kamakura Corporation * The Longstaff‚ÄìSchwartz model (1992) supposes the short rate dynamics are given by :: begin{align} dX_t & = (a_t-b X_t),dt + sqrt{X_t},c_t, dW_{1t}, [3pt] d Y_t & = (d_t-e Y_t),dt + sqrt{Y_t},f_t, dW_{2t}, end{align} : where the short rate is defined as :: dr_t = (mu X + theta Y),dt + sigma_t sqrt{Y} ,dW_{3t}. * The Chen model (1996) which has a stochastic mean and volatility of the short rate, is given by :: begin{align} dr_t & = (theta_t-alpha_t),dt + sqrt{r_t},sigma_t, dW_t, [3pt] dalpha_t & = (zeta_t-alpha_t),dt + sqrt{alpha_t},sigma_t, dW_t, [3pt] dsigma_t & = (beta_t-sigma_t),dt + sqrt{sigma_t},eta_t, dW_t. end{align} Other interest rate models The other major framework for interest rate modelling is the Heath‚ÄìJarrow‚ÄìMorton framework (HJM). Unlike the short rate models described above, this class of models is generally non-Markovian. This makes general HJM models computationally intractable for most purposes. The great advantage of HJM models is that they give an analytical description of the entire yield curve, rather than just the short rate. For some purposes (e.g., valuation of mortgage backed securities), this can be a big simplification. The Cox‚ÄìIngersoll‚ÄìRoss and Hull‚ÄìWhite models in one or more dimensions can both be straightforwardly expressed in the HJM framework. Other short rate models do not have any simple dual HJM representation. The HJM framework with multiple sources of randomness, including as it does the Brace‚ÄìGatarek‚ÄìMusiela model and market models, is often preferred for models of higher dimension.

Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Houghton played international football for the Republic of Ireland, for whom he qualified through his Irish father. Houghton is particularly remembered by Irish fans for scoring two of the most important goals in the national team's history, which resulted in 1‚Äì0 victories over England in Stuttgart at the 1988 European Championship, and Italy at Giants Stadium at the 1994 World Cup. At club level Houghton is best remembered for his success in the Liverpool side of the late 1980s. Club career =Early career= Houghton was born in Castlemilk, Glasgow (where Arthur Graham, who would also become an international footballer, was an upstairs neighbour in the same tenement block), but began his professional career in London at West Ham United, after moving to London at the age of 10, where he came through the ranks and signed professional forms as a 17-year-old on 5 July 1979. Houghton's endeavour failed to make any impact at Upton Park and after 3 years, in which he made just one appearance as substitute, he was on the move. On 7 July 1982 he moved on to Fulham on a free transfer. =Fulham= Malcolm Macdonald had Tony Gale (later a Premier League title winner with Blackburn Rovers), Paul Parker (who went on to win several major trophies with Manchester United), Gerry Peyton (Republic of Ireland international goalkeeper) and Ray Lewington (ex-Chelsea) to form a mixture of youth and experience which ultimately won Fulham promotion to the Second Division at the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season. He then added Houghton to the side that would try to keep the Cottagers in the second division. They did, and comfortably so; in fact for much of the 1982‚Äì83 season it looked as though Fulham would achieve back-to-back promotions, however, their form after the turn of the year dipped. One of the most memorable sequences of matches that happened whilst Houghton was at Fulham was the League Cup third round tie against Liverpool in 1983. The first game finished 1‚Äì1 at Craven Cottage as did the replay at Anfield, Fulham then won the toss to take the second replay back to the Cottage. Many observers believe Fulham had done enough to have beaten the reigning cup holders but had let the Reds off the hook with their failure to put away the chances they created. Liverpool won the game 1‚Äì0 with a 25-yard thunderbolt from Graeme Souness. In May 1985, he made a guest appearance for Manchester United in Peter Foley's testimonial. =Oxford United= Jim Smith had taken Oxford United to the top tier of English football. When he left in 1985, his replacement, Maurice Evans, looked to Houghton to help solidify their place in the league. He paid ¬£147,000 for Houghton on 13 September 1985. Houghton had played 145 times for Fulham and scored 21 goals. He made his U's debut the day after he signed, in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Liverpool at the Manor Ground. By the end of his first season, Houghton had helped to steer Oxford clear of the relegation places, just staying up with a win on the final day of the season, but most notably scored the second goal in the club's 3‚Äì0 League Cup final victory over Smith's new team Queens Park Rangers at Wembley. =Liverpool= At the start of the 1987‚Äì88 season, Oxford were beaten 2‚Äì0 by Liverpool, who then offered ¬£825,000 for his services. The deal was done and Houghton took the place of Craig Johnston on the right side of Liverpool's midfield, unusually wearing the No. 9 shirt which striker John Aldridge, his former Oxford teammate who had made the Anfield move himself a year earlier, had asked not to wear because of the pressure of replacing Ian Rush. Houghton was added to the new acquisitions of Aldridge, Peter Beardsley and John Barnes to form one of the most exciting forward lines in the club's history. He made his Reds debut on 24 October 1987 in the 1‚Äì0 league victory over Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. His first goal for the club came on 4 November 1987 in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Wimbledon at Plough Lane. Houghton's 62nd-minute strike came just two minutes after he had come on as a sub for Johnston. It also kept up Liverpool's run of 29 unbeaten league matches from the start of the season. Liverpool went on to coast to the League title, with Houghton contributing some fantastic displays as a marauding creator from the flank. He scored his share of goals too (though he was also renowned for missing great chances from close range) and contributed the first goal in the memorable, era-defining 5‚Äì0 win over Nottingham Forest which was later described as the performance of the century and was complimented by the game's greats such as Tom Finney. Houghton did his bit in the run to that season's FA Cup final too, scoring the winner in a fifth round derby at Everton and then clipping home a shot on the turn as Liverpool romped past Manchester City 4‚Äì0 in the quarter-finals. In the final, Liverpool surprisingly lost to Wimbledon and missed out on the \\"double\\". The following season, Houghton was again a regular as Liverpool battled towards another League and FA Cup \\"double\\", though they again would be denied. More important matters than football affected Houghton and his teammates in April 1989 however, as the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April claimed 94 lives (with the death toll eventually reaching 96). Upon returning to the game Liverpool went on to win the Cup with a 3‚Äì2 extra-time victory over Everton but lost the League title with virtually the last kick of the season in the title decider at Anfield against Arsenal. The following year Houghton and Liverpool regained the title when they finished 9 points ahead of Aston Villa, although Houghton managed just 19 out of 38 league appearances in the 1989‚Äì90 season and scored just once. Houghton played 32 times in the 1990‚Äì91 season, scoring seven goals, as Liverpool finished second in the League to Arsenal. He picked up another FA Cup winners' medal with Liverpool in the 1991‚Äì92 season and also had his best return in goals during his time at Anfield, finishing as the club second highest goalscorer with 12 goals, only bettered by Dean Saunders. However, Souness allowed Houghton to leave at the end of the season, partly due to the emergence of Steve McManaman.www.sporting-heroes.net =Aston Villa= After 202 appearances and 38 goals in his 5 successful years at Liverpool Houghton joined Aston Villa for ¬£900,000, with Villa manager Ron Atkinson fending off attempts by Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield to bring Houghton to West London. He made his debut on 15 August 1992 in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road, Villa's first game in the new FA Premier League. He again won the fans over with his robust style and helped Villa win the League Cup on 27 March 1994, although he was an unused sub for a Villa side who defeated Manchester United 3‚Äì1. This would be the only trophy that he won during his time at Villa. He did come close to collecting another title medal in his first season at Villa Park, as Villa had led the league at several stages of the campaign, but were eventually pushed into runners-up place by Manchester United, who were crowned champions by a 10-point margin. Houghton played a total of 117 times for Villa, scoring 11 goals. =Crystal Palace= On 23 March 1995 (transfer deadline day) Houghton left Villa to join Crystal Palace. Palace paid ¬£300,000 for the player hoping that his experience would help Palace stave off relegation from the Premier League and progress in the FA Cup, but they were relegated (despite finishing fourth from bottom as the division was being reduced to 20 clubs) and eliminated at the semi-final stage in the respective competitions. Houghton made his Palace debut, as a 33-year-old, on 1 April 1995 in the 2‚Äì1 win over Manchester City at Selhurst Park. One of Houghton's best performances for the South London club was on 28 September 1996 in the 6‚Äì1 thrashing of Southend United in a Division One fixture at Selhurst Park. Houghton was at the heart of everything Palace did, and scored a goal in the 38th minute. He spent just over two years at Palace, playing 87 times and scoring 8 goals. =Reading= Houghton signed for Reading on a free transfer on 15 July 1997. He made his debut the following month on 9 August in the 1‚Äì1 league draw with Bury at Gigg Lane. He spent a season at Elm Park and another at Reading's new home, the Madejski Stadium, which saw him rack up 56 appearances in which he scored just once, against Manchester City. Reading would be Houghton's last professional club, he had played 723 times during his career scoring 93 goals. =Stevenage Borough= Houghton wound his career down at Stevenage Borough in the Conference. He signed for Stevenage 24 September 1999 but only made three appearances before he finally retired from the game on 31 May 2000. International career Prior to his career with the Republic of Ireland, Houghton was a member of a Scotland U18 squad under Andy Roxburgh, failing to gain any caps. Despite becoming increasingly successful in his club career by 1986, he was not considered for the Scotland squad for the upcoming World Cup. Houghton qualified to play international football for the Republic of Ireland through his father, who was born in Buncrana in Inishowen, County Donegal, in Ulster. He earned his first cap in Jack Charlton's first match as manager, a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Wales in a friendly international at Lansdowne Road on 26 March 1986. In the summer of 1988, Houghton was selected for the Irish squad which had reached its first ever major finals, the European Championships in West Germany. The first group game on 12 June was against an England team that included Gary Lineker, Bryan Robson and Houghton's Liverpool club mates Peter Beardsley and John Barnes. Houghton scored with an early looping header to win the game 1‚Äì0, his first goal for Ireland. Ireland failed to get through the group stage after a draw against the USSR and a defeat against eventual champions The Netherlands. Houghton was selected for the Irish squad which qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. They were once again drawn in the same group as England, which included Lineker, Robson, Beardsley and Barnes as well as Paul Gascoigne and Chris Waddle. The game finished in a 1‚Äì1 draw. The Irish also drew with both Egypt, 0‚Äì0, and the Netherlands, 1‚Äì1, finishing on the same points (3), goal difference (0), and goals scored (2) as the Dutch. Both teams progressed to the second round, along with England who topped the group. On 25 June Ireland faced Romania at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris in Genoa. Following a hard earned 0‚Äì0 draw, the game went to penalties with Houghton scoring the second penalty kick to help Ireland win 5‚Äì4 and qualify for the quarter-finals. Ireland were defeated 1‚Äì0 by the host nation Italy in a closely fought match. Houghton was selected in the Irish squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States and was once again the goalscoring hero in a shock victory. In the 11th minute of the group E match at Giants Stadium on 18 June Houghton hit a looping shot into the net to defeat Italy, gaining revenge for the defeat Ireland had suffered at the hands of the Italians four years earlier. Ireland were knocked out of the tournament at the next stage by the Netherlands. Houghton's final appearance was as a substitute in the 1998 FIFA World Cup play-off match with Belgium in Brussels. Ireland lost the match 2‚Äì1 (3‚Äì2 on aggregate) with Houghton scoring his final international goal. He had represented Ireland 73 times scoring 6 goals.

Early and personal life He was born in Farsund as a son of Lars Mortensen Sundt (1762‚Äì1850) and Karen Bing Drejer (1777‚Äì1865). He was a distant descendant of Peter Drejer. He was a third cousin of Christian Sundt, uncle of Lauritz and Karen Sundt, granduncle of Vigleik, Halfdan and Harald Sundt, and great-granduncle of Leif Sundt Rode. His father was a ship captain, and he was born into a large family of 13 children. All the children worked to help make ends meet. Farsund at that time had many seamen, small fishermen and chandlers. This provided his initial exposure to the ideas which he came to examine extensively later in his life: poverty, overpopulation and the work issues associated with the transition from an older farm culture to 19th century business and industry. In February 1859 he married Nicoline Conradine Hansen (1822‚Äì81), a daughter of Maurits Christopher Hansen. They had the son Einar Sundt, a publisher. Career In 1835 he began his studies in Kristiania, but came back to Farsund in 1838 and became a teacher. He resumed his studies in Kristiania in 1841. There he met and became close friends with Henrik Wergeland, who was also born and raised in Agder. When Henrik Wergeland was buried in 1845, Eilert Sundt led the student contingent and spoke at the funeral on their behalf. His interests in sociology were broad. He studied prison conditions, customs and treatment of Gypsies, causes of death, the evils of married life in Norway, conditions of prostitutes, suicide, fishery and forestry workers' living and working conditions, building customs, shipping practices, household cleanliness and administration of poverty laws. A man of his times, he also was interested in ethnography, ethnology, architecture, and demography, linguistics (with special emphasis on the dialects of Norwegian). From 1857 to 1866 Eilert Sundt was editor for Folkevennen (\\"Friend of the People\\"), for which he wrote a number of the more important articles. His work served to inform many of the authors of Norwegian literature in their transition to a socially aware realism at the close of the 19th century. Eilert Sundt served as the parish priest in Eidsvoll from 1869, and he died there in 1875. Two of his works were selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon in 2009‚Äì2011.

Its headquarters are in Kempston, Bedfordshire. As of September 2017, the force had a workforce of 1,136 police officers, 859 police staff, 63 police community support officers, 60 designated officers and 195 special constables. In terms of officer numbers, it is the 8th smallest police force in the United Kingdom with the 5th smallest geographic area of responsibility. History A professional police force was established in Bedfordshire in 1839, under the County Police Act 1839, replacing the earlier system of elected parish constables. It initially comprised a chief constable, who was based in Ampthill, 6 superintendents and 40 constables. Constables were paid 19 shillings a week, which was nearly twice the typical wage of an agricultural labourer in the county at that time.Joyce Godber, History of Bedfordshire 1066-1888, Bedfordshire County Council, 1969, reprinted 1984, , pp 479, 538-539. There was an independent Luton Borough Police from 1876 to 1947, and then from 1964 to 1966, when it amalgamated with Bedfordshire Constabulary, which was then known as the Bedfordshire and Luton Constabulary until 1974. In 1965, Bedfordshire Constabulary had an establishment of 497 and an actual strength of 430.The Thin Blue Line, Police Council for Great Britain Staff Side Claim for Undermanning Supplements, 1965. On 11 June 2007 PC Jon Henry, was fatally stabbed whilst on duty in the town centre of Luton by a Nigerian immigrant, Tennyson Obih. Obih was convicted of his murder, along with the attempted murder and wounding with intent of two other men that he stabbed on the same morning.Nigerian charged with PC's murder, Daily Telegraph, 24 March 2009. Structure Bedfordshire Police has collaborated in the formation of several specialist units with Hertfordshire Constabulary and Cambridgeshire Constabulary including Major Crime, Dogs, Firearms and Roads Policing. The force also leads regional units including Eastern Region Special Operations Unit and Eastern Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit with forces in Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. In June 2015, the force implemented a new operating model ‚Äì which comprises north and south bases and aims to increase the number of warranted officers in local communities. Initiatives and controversies Bedfordshire Police publish results of cases on their official website, such as a drug gang who were jailed for 39 years.http://www.bedfordshire.police.uk/about_us/news/offenders_brought_to_justice/120305_-_drug_dealers_sentence.aspx Bedfordshire Police's cadets have recently scooped a national award for their outstanding contribution to helping to reduce crime and creating a safer community. In 2014 Bedfordshire Police took the unprecedented move to allow cameras into the force 24/7 to film a fly-on-the-wall documentary capturing some of the issues faced by police officers today. The last series ended in June 2016 but more episodes are planned for the near future. In July 2015, Bedfordshire Police was the first force in the country to secure a Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) protection order. The court order allowed officers to seize the passports of two young girls who it was thought were being taken to Africa. On 15 November 2016, Bedfordshire Police posted a tweet to support Islamophobia Awareness Month. The image accompanying the tweet showed a hand with raised finger - a symbol used by ISIS (Daesh). The tweet was removed following complaints and Bedfordshire Police commented: Resources The force's 2016 to 2017 Budget was set at ¬£101.483m. The workforce as of November 2015 consisted of: * Chief Officer (ACPO) - 3 * Chief Superintendent - 3 * Superintendent - 9 * Chief Inspector - 24 * Inspector - 57 * Sergeant - 161 * Constable - 837 * Total - 1,093 Civilians - 896 * CSOs - 105 As of 2017, Bedfordshire Police are considering not responding to some low level crimes due to funding restrictions.Police 'to give up on minor crimes without major funding increase' The Guardian Kathryn Holloway stated that the force has made almost ¬£35 million in cuts and would face further cuts of ¬£11.4 million to ¬£12.5 million over the coming four years ‚Äúif things remain unchanged‚Äù. Equipment Like other UK police forces, Bedfordshire Police officers are not routinely armed. The force employs firearms officers to deal with firearms incidents in the area. However all (except PCSOs) officers are equipped with Hiatt Speedcuffs, PAVA incapacitant spray, Velcro fastwrap and leg restraints. Some officers are also equipped with the TASER X2 Conductive Energy Device (CED) with very few officers carrying the TASERX26 CED which is due to be phased out. Governance The first Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner was Olly Martins, who was elected on 15 November 2012 and took office on 21 November 2012. The performance of the police and crime commissioner is scrutinised by the Bedfordshire Police and Crime Panel, made up of elected councillors from the local authorities in the police area, and two independent members. Before November 2012 the Bedfordshire Police Authority was the police governance. On 5 May 2016 Kathryn Holloway became the second Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner after winning the vote against Olly Martins and other candidates. The Office of Police and Crime Commissioner's permanent Chief Executive Officer is Clare Kelly.

Biography  Peretz Smolenskin was born in Monastyrshchina, Mogilev Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Smolensk Oblast, Russia). His family came from Smolensk. His older brother was seized by the Czar's army and never returned. His father, falsely accused of a crime, was a fugitive for over two years and died when Peretz was eleven. At the age of 12, he left home to study at yeshiva for five years. He began reading secular books and learning Russian under the influence of the Haskalah movement. Smolenskin traveled through southern Russia and the Crimea, supporting himself by singing in choirs and preaching in synagogues. In 1862 he settled in Odessa where he studied music and languages and taught Hebrew. He published his first story in 1867. In the course of his travels through Romania, Germany and Bohemia, he acquired Turkish nationality. Literary career Front page of HaShachar In Vienna, Smolenskin founded HaShachar (The Dawn), a Hebrew journal that became a literary platform for the Haskalah movement and early Jewish nationalism. He also wrote novels and short stories in Hebrew. He was stricken with tuberculosis in 1883 and died on February 1, 1885 in Merano, Italy. He completed his last novel, The Inheritance, shortly before his death.Institute for Translation of Hebrew Literature: Peretz Smolenskin Smolenskin was a leader in the revolt of young Jews against medievalism and a strong voice for Jewish nationalism. His Hebrew periodical, The Dawn (Ha-shahar ◊î◊©◊ó◊®), was highly influential in these spheres. Shortly before his death he was associated with Laurence Oliphant and became deeply interested in schemes for the colonization of Palestine. Smolenskin was among the first of the Jewish nationalists to disassociate Messianic ideals from theological concomitants.

Early career and the Crimean War Born in Livonia, Elphinstone joined the Corps of Royal Engineers as a gentleman cadet at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in December 1847. With the outbreak of the Crimean War, Elphinstone was posted to the Crimea and it was during the Siege of Sebastopol that he won the Victoria Cross. =Victoria Cross= On 18 June 1855, he was 25 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. His citation read: =Further honours= With the end of the war he was decorated by both Napoleon III, Emperor of France being appointed as a Knight of the Legion of Honour; and Abd√ºlmecid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire who appointed him to the 5th class of the Order of the Medjidie. Subsequent career Elphinstone ended the Crimean War as a brevet major and as a substantive second captain in the Royal Engineers, (Wrongly named in the Gazette as Howard Crawford Elphinstone) but was promoted to the substantive Army (but not Corps) rank of major in 1858. In 1859 he joined the Royal Household of Queen Victoria as governor to Prince Arthur, the third son of Queen Victoria, and later also governor to Prince Leopold, Her Majesty's fourth son. In 1865 the Queen rewarded him for his service as governor by appointing him as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (Civil Division). In 1868 he was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel and in 1870 he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Further honours came Elphinstone's way when Prince Arthur obtained his majority in 1871, firstly in May he was appointed Comptroller of the Household to Prince Arthur, the same month he was made a Companion of the Military Division of Order of the Bath, and finally in July was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Civil Division of the Order of the Bath. He married Annie Frances Cole (1856‚Äì1938) and they settled at Pinewood, Bagshot, close to Prince Arthur's home at Bagshot Park. Lady Elphinstone lived at Pinewood until her death in 1938. They had four daughters: Victoria (1877‚Äì1952); Irene (1878‚Äì1957), Olive (1882‚Äì1968) and Mary (1888‚Äì1965). All four married army officers. Mary married Colonel Robert Singleton McClintock, son of Francis Leopold McClintock. Promotions also followed; in 1872 his substantive promotion to major was confirmed and the following year he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Returning to military service Elphinstone served as an Aide-de-camp to the Queen in 1877Porter p. 322 and was promoted to colonel at the end of 1881, and was appointed as Officer Commanding Royal Engineers in Mauritius, a post he was reluctant to take up, so much so that he was prepared to resign from the army; however under customs then allowed in the British Army, a posting could be avoided if another officer was prepared to take the posting instead. Normally this involved payment to the substitute officer but Elphinstone was fortunate to meet fellow Royal Engineer officer, Colonel Charles Gordon who was willing to take the posting to Mauritius without payment.Boulger pp. 72‚Äì73. During 1884‚Äì5 he served as military attache in Berlin. In 1887 he was promoted to major general and in 1889 he became General Officer Commanding Western District but he drowned in 1890 when he fell overboard while on a trip to Madeira.Parry & Wood p. 445.

This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides only a \\"bridge\\" to the actual kernel interfaces. FUSE is available for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD (as puffs), OpenSolaris, Minix 3, Android and macOS. FUSE is free software originally released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License.  History  The FUSE system was originally part of AVFS (A Virtual Filesystem), a filesystem implementation heavily influenced by the translator concept of the GNU Hurd. It superseded Linux Userland Filesystem, and provided a translational interface using in libfuse1. FUSE was originally released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License, later also reimplemented as part of the FreeBSD base system and released under the terms of Simplified BSD license. An ISC-licensed re-implementation by Sylvestre Gallon was released in March 2013, and incorporated into OpenBSD in June 2013. FUSE was merged into the mainstream Linux kernel tree in kernel version 2.6.14. The userspace side of FUSE, the library, generally followed the pace of Linux kernel development while maintaining \\"best effort\\" compatibility with BSD descendants. This is possible because the kernel FUSE reports its own \\"feature levels\\", or versions. The exception is the FUSE fork for macOS, OSXFUSE, which has too many exceptions for sharing a library. A break in libfuse history is libfuse3, which includes some incompatible improvements in the interface and performance, compared to the older libfuse2 now under maintenance mode. As the kernel-userspace protocol of FUSE is versioned and public, a programmer can choose to use a different piece of code in place of and still communicate with the kernel's FUSE facilities. On the other hand, and its many ports provide a portable high-level interface that may be implemented on a system without a \\"FUSE\\" facility.  Operation and usage  A flow-chart diagram showing how FUSE works: Request from userspace to list files (ls -l /tmp/fuse) gets redirected by the Kernel through VFS to FUSE. FUSE then executes the registered handler program (./hello) and passes it the request (ls -l /tmp/fuse). The handler program returns a response back to FUSE which is then redirected to the userspace program that originally made the request. To implement a new file system, a handler program linked to the supplied \`libfuse\` library needs to be written. The main purpose of this program is to specify how the file system is to respond to read/write/stat requests. The program is also used to mount the new file system. At the time the file system is mounted, the handler is registered with the kernel. If a user now issues read/write/stat requests for this newly mounted file system, the kernel forwards these IO-requests to the handler and then sends the handler's response back to the user. Unmounting a FUSE-based file system with the \`fusermount\` command FUSE is particularly useful for writing virtual file systems. Unlike traditional file systems that essentially work with data on mass storage, virtual filesystems don't actually store data themselves. They act as a view or translation of an existing file system or storage device. In principle, any resource available to a FUSE implementation can be exported as a file system.

Brett Cloutman was educated at Berkhamsted School, Bishop's Stortford College and London University where he was a member of the Royal Engineers contingent of the university's Officers' Training Corps. At the outbreak of World War I Cloutman enlisted as a Rifleman in the Rangers (12th Battalion, London Regiment), reached the rank of Lance-Corporal, and in 1915 was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Kent (Fortress) Engineers, a Territorial Force unit.The London Gazette, 9 March 1915 Military Cross Cloutman, by then Acting Major in command of the 59th Field Company, Royal Engineers, was awarded the Military Cross for an action in September 1918: > For conspicuous gallantly and devotion to duty at Banteux on the morning of > 30th September, 1918, when he made a personal reconnaissance under heavy > machine-gun fire to ascertain the possibilities of bridging the Canal de > L'Escaut.Supplement to the London Gazette, 1 February 1919 Victoria Cross A few weeks later the action took place for which Cloutman won his VC. The official citation read: The bridge had been prepared for demolition by the Germans, and was well defended. By cutting the wires, Cloutman prevented the enemy from blowing it up at the time. He was seen at the bridge, however, and escaped under an intense fire from its guards. The fact that the abutments were not destroyed later meant that the bridge could be more quickly replaced by the Allies. This was the last act to win a VC in the First World War.

P. (5 September 1818 ‚Äì December 1848) was an explorer in Australia in the mid nineteenth century. He was the Assistant- Surveyor of New South Wales, working with Sir Thomas Mitchell. Kennedy explored the interior of Queensland and northern New South Wales, including the Thomson River, the Barcoo River, Cooper Creek, and Cape York Peninsula. He died in December 1848 after being speared by Aboriginal Australians in far north Queensland near Cape York. Early life Kennedy was born on 5 September 1818 on Guernsey in the Channel Islands to Colonel Thomas Kennedy (British Army) and Mary Ann (Smith) Kennedy. He was the sixth born of nine children, comprising five boys and four girls. Kennedy was educated at Elizabeth College Guernsey, and expressed an early interest in surveying. In 1837 he went to Rio de Janeiro, returning to England in 1838 when the business house in which he worked closed down. A naval officer friend of the family, Captain Charles James Tyers, suggested that if Kennedy obtained the necessary qualifications, he would arrange employment for him in Australia. During 1839 Kennedy attended lectures in surveying at King's College London, obtaining a certificate from his tutor. In November 1839 Kennedy sailed for Sydney in the barque Globe which arrived in March 1840. Another family contact Captain Perry, who was deputy to Sir Thomas Mitchell, arranged a position for Kennedy as assistant surveyor in the New South Wales Survey Department after he had passed an examination. In August Kennedy was assigned to join Tyers on an overland journey to Melbourne, thence to Portland Bay for survey duties. Whilst there, he met an Irish immigrant Margaret Murphy with whom he had a daughter, although they remained unmarried. Their daughter Eliza died at age five. During this period, Kennedy developed his professional skills, however a disagreement with the local port magistrate James Blair resulted in his recall to Sydney in May 1843. Nevertheless, his work at Portland Bay was praised, and he was looked upon favourably by Mitchell, who subsequently selected him for the next expedition at very short notice. First expedition In 1845, Mitchell received authority from London for an expedition from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria terminating at Port Essington. He was convinced that a major river must run in a north-westerly direction to the gulf, and that he would be the one to discover it. His initial choice for second in command was the surveyor Townsend, but shortly before setting off, Edmund Kennedy was appointed to replace him. On 5 November Kennedy was sworn in as a Justice of the Peace at the Supreme Court, and the expedition set off from Sydney in mid November. The party trekked via Parramatta and Bathurst to a rendezvous point at Boree. Kennedy in a letter to his father noted that the party consisted of 30 men, 12 months supplies plus \\"8 drays, 3 carts, 102 bullocks, 255 sheep, [and]17 horses.\\" The large size of the expedition was to be detrimental to the rate of progress. Mitchell tracked north along the Bogan River, east to the Macquarie, north to the Narran, then along the Balonne. Here Mitchell found a natural rocky causeway and named it St George Bridge, near the present town of St George, Queensland. To allow time for stock to refresh, he left Kennedy at a depot camp for three weeks, thereafter to follow slowly while Mitchell probed northwards with a small party. Mitchell continued to follow the Balonne, which took him too far north-east, so he veered west until coming across the Maranoa River where Kennedy and the main party caught up on 1 June 1846. By now Mitchell realised that their equipment was a cumbersome impediment to progress, so he decided to leave Kennedy behind again, near the present town of Mitchell. He was gone for four and a half months. Initially Mitchell followed the Maranoa to its headwaters, and entered an area of hills which left him perplexed. At least four streams, the Nogoa, Belyando, Nive and Nivelle were traced to determine their direction of flow, but none trended north-west, and much time was employed in so doing. He left yet another party behind and travelled north-west with only a native guide and two men. Finally he discovered a substantial river which seemed to flow towards the gulf, so he named the river Victoria, after the British Sovereign. Mitchell had reached the limit of his supplies, and was forced to turn back. The two smaller teams rejoined and returned to Kennedy's depot on 19 October. The expedition then beat a retreat to Sydney, arriving 20 January 1847. Second expedition Mitchell was impressed with the leadership qualities of Kennedy, as demonstrated by his management of the depot camps in 1846, and his technical skills relating to survey and exploration. As the question of a great north- west river remained unanswered, Mitchell gained approval in February 1847 for a new expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria, with the express purpose of plotting the course of his Victoria River en route. This time he placed Kennedy in charge of a party of eight, which set off from Windsor, New South Wales 21 March 1847. His instructions were to travel via St. George Bridge (14 May) to the Maranoa (8 June) where his earlier depot had been, then determine the course of the Victoria. Kennedy had spent some time plotting Mitchell's Victoria river on the latest map of the colony, and was struck by the fact that its general course turned towards a bend of Cooper Creek, named by Charles Sturt in 1845. The expedition continued northward over what was now new territory for Kennedy, and by mid August was in the vicinity from which Mitchell had been forced to return. Kennedy decided to conceal the carts and supplies from local aborigines by digging a large trench in which to bury them, then proceeded by packhorse. The river began turning towards the south- west, taking them away from the gulf. Scouting ahead he found a substantial tributary joining the Victoria from the north, and named it the Thomson River in honour of the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Edward Deas Thomson. The country began to deteriorate and by early September Kennedy was forced to retreat to his hidden cache because of lack of water and supplies. The river by this time showed no sign of turning towards the gulf, but looked as though it would run into the Cooper. Kennedy's plan altered then to split the party and make a dash for the gulf. When a buried cart was opened at the cache however, it was found to have been tampered with by natives and a great deal of the supplies had been destroyed. This left the expedition with no alternative but to retreat to Sydney. On the homeward journey, Kennedy followed the course of the Warrego River (discovered by Mitchell in 1846), until its course took him too far west, splitting into many channels. He then headed east, intercepted the Culgoa River, and returned to Sydney 7 February 1848. It was later proved that the Victoria did flow into Cooper Creek, thus it was renamed Barcoo River, an Aboriginal name for the river that Kennedy had learnt. Third expedition Expeditions of Kennedy This memorial plaque was unveiled at Portland Roads (Weymouth Bay) North Queensland, 100 years after Edmund Kennedy's fateful expedition to Cape York Peninsula. Sketch of Kennedy's death. The Government's plan for Kennedy's next journey was primarily to find a way to the gulf, to be followed by exploration of Cape York Peninsula. The importance of Port Essington (the only port in northern Australia at the time) had declined, but trade along the east coast between Sydney and Singapore had increased, which prompted Captain Owen Stanley of to recommend that the east coast of Cape York be explored first. He further suggested that after a resupply of the party at the tip of the cape, the exploration could continue down the west coast, with a subsequent return overland to Sydney. It was anticipated that eighteen months would be required to complete the trip. This idea was accepted, and planning began for Kennedy to head for a starting point at Rockingham Bay, near the present town of Cardwell, Queensland. On 28 April 1848 Edmund Kennedy and twelve men sailed from Sydney Harbour in the barque Tam O' Shanter escorted by Rattlesnake. They arrived at Rockingham Bay 20 May, but once they had landed, the party encountered terrible terrain such as mangrove swamps, mountains, lagoons, rivers, and thick rainforest that made it almost impossible to travel with horses, carts, and sheep. After nine weeks, they had travelled just 40 miles from the coast, and 12 miles north of the landing point. Kennedy had to abandon the carts and some supplies in a hopeless bog. Further on, the storeman was found to have stolen food from the supplies, and was demoted to labourer. The party was due to rendezvous at Princess Charlotte Bay with the supply ship Bramble in early August, but this did not occur as the party was two months late, and in any case there was no close approach for Bramble. =Death= By mid November, the men and horses began to weaken, so the decision was taken to leave eight men behind at Weymouth Bay, while Kennedy and four others continued north. There were still several hundred miles to go to a rendezvous point with the ship Ariel, before any hope of a rescue was possible. Days after crossing the Pascoe River, when in the vicinity of Shelburne Bay, Costigan accidentally shot himself while tending his horse and could not continue, so Luff and Dunn were left behind to care for him. They were never seen again. Kennedy and his aboriginal tracker Jackey Jackey pressed on towards Port Albany and the rendezvous, but they were closely followed by local indigenous peoples. Near the banks of the Escape River, 20 miles from the tip of Cape York, Kennedy was speared several times and died in Jackey Jackey's arms. From existing reports it seems that Kennedy's death resulted from attacks that seem \\"not to have been directly provoked\\". After a feat of endurance of about ten days with no supplies, Jackey Jackey made it to the supply ship alone 23 December 1848. Following directions from Jackey Jackey, Ariel proceeded to Shelburne Bay, and sent a search party ashore. A few relics were found, but no sign of the three men. The ship continued to Weymouth Bay where William Carron and William Goddard were found to be the only survivors of the eight men left there. Ariel with its three surviving expeditioners returned to Sydney in May 1849.

The team was published by the imprint Marvel UK in a self-titled comic from 1990 to 1993, and in the anthology title Overkill. It was written by Dan Abnett and John Tomlinson with art by Gary Erskine. Pendragon is an alternate name for King Arthur. Publication history The comic was created during a period of attempted expansion by Marvel UK, trying to build on the critical success of Captain Britain. Knights of Pendragon was initially a highly political and environmental comic, its themes borrowing heavily from British folklore and the growing New Age and neopagan subcultures. The comic was even printed on Scangloss, which is an environmentally friendly paper using half the trees and minimum whitening bleach. Later issues dropped or downplayed these elements and the series became a more standard superhero title. The series initially met with a positive critical reaction and strong sales, but sales declined as the series went on. It was cancelled with issue #18. Skip Dietz and Hoang Nguyen featured the team in Marvel Comics Presents #122 (February 1993); the story is about an investigation into the cause of crop circles. John Freeman pitched a follow-up called Armageddon Knights in late 1993, but never received a response; the story, which featured Grace and Union Jack, would have wrapped up loose-ends from the preceding series. Synopsis Knights of Pendragon #6 from December 1990 The team is formed to be agents of the Green Knight (from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight), who is portrayed as an aspect of the Green Man; a mystical entity representing the natural cycle and spiritual growth. The Knight is in ageless conflict with the Bane, an unnatural destructive force of warfare and winter, apparently led by the Red Knight, the Green Knight's adversary. The Green Knight invests power, in the form of a possessing spirit bestowing powers, to various groups throughout British history, to protect nature; one such group were the original Knights of the Round Table; the Knights of Pendragon are a modern-day incarnation. =First volume= Dai Thomas, a supporting character from the Captain Britain strip and burnt-out Scotland Yard Inspector, is assigned to solve a series of gruesome murders of ecologically-based criminals (corrupt farmers, ivory hunters, exotic bird smugglers, and so on). Accompanied by satellite reporter Kate McClellan, Thomas becomes obsessed with fighting the criminals themselves, and after a series of visions, becomes superhumanly strong and battle-savvy. Captain Britain is sent by the British Government to retrieve the apparently insane Thomas from a cut-down section of the Amazon Rainforest, they instead fight, and Britain kills Thomas. It becomes apparent that Thomas and the Captain are possessed by the spirit of Gawain and Lancelot respectively from the time of King Arthur. The Captain was destined to kill Thomas in accordance to Arthurian lore. He is then resurrected. The three of them travel to the Green Knight's citadel, whilst Thomas/Gawain recounts the Green Knight's poem. The comic's interpretation of the beheading-themed poem is as an ecological metaphor, a pact between man and nature: : 'A bargain between man and the great wild force that should stand forever, that neither should take more than he can give back...destroy more than he can replace...strike deep, and refuse to accept a blow in return.\\" Man had forgotten that pact, and so the Knight was lashing out in pain. Gawain sacrifices his Pendragon power to partially heal the Knight, and also to spark the creation of another Pendragon group. =Later appearances= The Green Knight and the Pendragon Force briefly appeared in the later Captain Britain and MI13 series, when the alien Skrulls invaded Avalon (as part of the \\"Secret Invasion\\" event). The Green Knight was decapitated by a Super-Skrull and the Pendragon Force was briefly controlled by the Skrulls and redistributed to empower the Skrull soldiers attacking London. With the failure of their invasion, the Green Knight was restored and the Skrulls lost control of the Pendragon Force. In 2014's Revolutionary War, the Pendragons were shown as part of the final battle against Mys-Tech. Years later, Dai, Kate, Union Jack, an elderly Albion, and new ally Pete Wisdom united to stop Omni-Corporation from digging up an old Mys-Tech base in the Lake District. The base contained perverted zombie clones of the original Round Table (complete with \\"Zombie Excalibur\\") who wanted to slaughter and return Britain to a distorted Dark Ages, and sent a defeated Albion to Psycho- Wraith Prime. Wisdom turned the tide by reawakening the Green Knight in a new form, representing the best of modern Britain (deliberately resembling Mo Farah).Revolutionary War: Knights of Pendragon by Rob Williams and Will Sliney(2014) Albion was used as part of a portal to bring Mephisto's Hell to Earth but the Knights helped stop it. Afterwards, the team disbanded again.Revolutionary War: Omega by Andy Lanning, Alan Cowsill and Rich Elson (2014) =Characters= The team, a mix of everyday people and superheroes, consisted mostly of new characters, with the exception of Union Jack. Each member was the modern day version of an Arthurian knight, and was possessed by the same ancient spirit that had possessed that knight. The Green Knight gave each of them powers, including heightened senses and fighting skill, the ability to speak with animals, and the ability to shoot blasts of \\"Pendragon fire\\". The full roster was: *Albion (Peter Hunter): A history teacher who has had the power of Albion since World War I. He has battled the Bane throughout the years. He currently equates to Merlin, although the spirit that originally possessed him was that of Herne the Hunter. The leader of the group, he represents the Green Knight's aspects of intellect and wisdom. *Adam Crown: A young man whose Pendragon power was awoken by the team breaking up, he reunited the team and led it in battle against the Bane's forces. He possessed the spirit of King Arthur. *Ben Gallagher: A writer with an obsession concerning the Holy Grail, Gallagher equated to Percival. He embodies the Green Knight's spiritual and sensitive aspects. *Francesca Lexley Grace: An agent of the Bane reformed by Adam, she became a Pendragon, possessed by the spirit of Morgause. *Breeze James: A reporter hired by the malevolent technomagical company Mys-Tech to learn about the Pendragons, she became the new Guenevere after Kate McClellan left the team. *Kate McClellan: A reporter who was investigating a series of \\"eco-terrorist\\" attacks which turned out to be the work of the Green Man, she became the equivalent of Guinevere. Her son, Cam, was also a Pendragon, briefly possessing the spirit of Merlin, before Hunter reclaimed it. *Sir Gawain: A robot from an Arthurian theme park, possessed by the spirit of Gawain, which had left its intended host. *Union Jack (Joseph Chapman): The third hero to call himself Union Jack (the first was a World War I period character created by Roy Thomas, the second was his son), he equated to Lancelot. Not all Pendragons were members of the team. Captain Britain was briefly Lancelot, and his police contact Inspector Dai Thomas was possessed by the spirit of Gawain before the robot. It was also suggested that Iron Man and Black Panther were unawakened Pendragons, having the spirits of Bedevere and Robin Hood respectively. It is not known if the Black Knight's current title of Pendragon is connected to the team.

Early life Clifford was the third son of Hugh Clifford, 7th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, who died in 1858, by his marriage with Mary Lucy, only daughter of Thomas (afterwards Cardinal) Weld of Lulworth Castle, Dorsetshire. He was born on 12 September 1826 and received his first commission as a second lieutenant in The Rifle Brigade, on 7 August 1846. He served in South Africa against the Gaikas under Sandili in the following year, and then against the Boers until their submission at Weinberg on the Vaal river. On the outbreak of another Kaffir war in 1852 he again went to Africa, where he remained until November 1853. Crimean War and the Victoria Cross He took part in the Crimean war, where he received the appointment of aide-de- camp to Sir George Brown, commanding the light division, and was present at Alma and Inkerman, and for his gallantry in the latter battle was decorated with the Victoria Cross, by leading one of the charges, killing one of the enemy with his sword, disabling another and saving the life of a soldier (5 November 1854). In May 1855, he was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster- general, and remaining in the Crimea until the conclusion of the war was then promoted to the rank of brevet major, and received the medal and clasps for Alma, Inkerman, and Sebastopol, and from foreign governments the Legion of Honour and the 5th class of the Medjidie. Later career On the outbreak of hostilities in China he sailed thither, and as assistant quartermaster-general was present at the operations between December 1857 and January 1858 which resulted in the capture of Canton. For his services he received the brevet of lieutenant-colonel, with the China medal and Canton clasp. On his return to England, he commenced a long term of service on the staff; he was assistant quartermaster-general at Aldershot 1860‚Äì4, held a similar appointment at headquarters 1865‚Äì1868, was aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief 1870‚Äì3, and assistant adjutant-general at headquarters 1873‚Äì5. Early in 1879, Clifford was selected to proceed to South Africa to take charge of the communications of Lord Chelmsford between Durban and the forces in the field. His task was no light one, for great confusion prevailed at Durban, the port of disembarkation; but by his great experience in staff duties, his knowledge of the requirements of the supply of an army, and, above all, by his familiarity with native warfare and his indefatigable nature, he very soon reduced everything to order, and his labours were fully acknowledged by Sir Garnet Wolseley. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 2 June 1869, and a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 19 December 1879, and was granted a pension of ¬£100 for distinguished services on 7 October 1874. He served as General Officer Commanding Eastern District of England from April to September 1882. He died at Ugbrooke, near Chudleigh in Devon on 12 April 1883.

The Cleveland Police area covers approximately and has a population of over 554,000. As of September 2017, the force had 1,274 police officers, 278 police staff, 124 police community support officers and 64 special constables. In terms of officer numbers, Cleveland Police is the 12th smallest of the 48 police forces of the United Kingdom. Geographically, its area of responsibility is the second smallest of the territorial police forces with only the City of London Police having a smaller police area. Cleveland Police area is divided into four local policing areas (LPAs), previously known as districts, which are coterminous with the four unitary authorities of Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton-on-Tees. These LPAs are split between North and South of the River Tees for operational purposes. The force is responsible for policing a predominantly urban, densely populated area, closely resembling metropolitan authorities in socio-economic characteristics and policing needs. The Cleveland Criminal Justice Area is a major production centre for the chemical industry, which results in the large-scale transport by road, rail and sea of hazardous substances. The chemical industry remains a key economic factor and presents the force, other emergency services and partners with a significant major incident risk. History Cleveland Police Crest The force was established as Cleveland Constabulary on 1 April 1974, covering the newly created county of Cleveland (which was abolished on 1 April 1996, being replaced with the four unitary authorities). It was renamed Cleveland Police, from Cleveland Constabulary. It is a successor to the Teesside Constabulary, and also the York and North East Yorkshire Police, which existed before 1974, and also took over part of Durham Constabulary. The police area is the second smallest geographically, after the area covered by the City of London Police. Under proposals made by the Home Secretary on 6 February 2006, a proposal for a merger with Northumbria Police and Durham Constabulary to form a single strategic police force for the North East England was suggested but there was no support for this. Cleveland Police favoured merging with the southern area of Durham Constabulary. In July 2006, the plans to merge the three forces were scrapped. Developments On 31 January 2007, the new headquarters in Middlesbrough were opened, boasting a 50-cell custody unit including a purpose-built prevention of terrorism suite, one of only three in the country. It has been designed to increase the speed and safety of detainee handling with secure vehicle docking, video links to court and CCTV links in all cells for improved prisoner safety. The Middlesbrough headquarters is the centrepiece of Cleveland Police Authority's multi-million pound private finance initiative project which has also seen a new headquarters for Redcar and Cleveland district and new town offices in Redcar and South Bank. The building, which was officially opened by the then Home Secretary John Reid, is seen as not only the spearhead to policing Cleveland in the 21st century but also the gateway to the regeneration of the St Hilda's area of the town and the flagship Middlehaven project. In 2008 Cleveland Police launched its volunteer scheme, by which members of the local community can offer a minimum of 4 hours a week helping the force. As the scheme progresses more roles are expected to become available. On 5 January 2009 the force launched its cadets programme, something which many other police forces have operated for some years. There are 20 places available in each district, and the cadets will meet each week in groups run by Police Officers, Police Community Support Officers, Youth Workers and Volunteers. There will also be the chance to gain recognised qualifications, such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award. Since 2010 Cleveland Police and neighbouring Durham Constabulary have shared road policing and firearms teams through a joint Specialist Operations Unit. These officers are based at Cleveland's base at Wynyard Park Business Park and Durham's station in Spennymoor. Durham and Cleveland Police have shared a Tactical Training Centre in Urlay Nook, near Teesside International Airport (formerly Durham Tees Valley Airport), since 2001. In January 2019, Chief Constable Mike Veale resigned after being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on a matter of \\"serious allegations\\" of misconduct. In April 2019 it was reported that Assistant Chief Constable Adrian Roberts had been arrested. It is not clear for what criminal offence, however reports suggest it relates to an offence outside of England & Wales. Following his arrest Roberts was suspended whilst a gross misconduct discipline investigation took place.Cleveland Police would not say why the ACC had been arrested nor reveal the allegations made against him. Daily Telegraph 19 April 2019 'Scandal-ridden police force has chief arrested for misconduct' page 11 In September 2019, the Cleveland police force was put into special measures after Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services rated the service as inadequate overall and in three key areas: the extent to which the force is effective at reducing crime and keeping people safe; operates efficiently and sustainably; and treats the public and its workforce legitimately were all found inadequate. A year after the publication of the report, the PCC, Barry Coppinger, resigned stating stress and how the workload was \\"impacting on my health\\". His resignation was immediate in September 2020 and an interim PCC will take over until an election for the post in May 2021. Controversy In 2007 it was reported that Detective Constable Steve Pennington who was convicted of a drink driving offence in 2000, and subsequently jailed for four months, had been granted a ¬£500,000 pay off by the force, garnering much criticism from members of the public and anti drink driving campaigns. Cleveland Police Vauxhall Vivaro In April 2012, Cleveland Police admitted liability for \\"malicious prosecution\\" and were ordered to pay out over ¬£841,000, one of the largest compensation sums in UK police history. The court was told former PC Sultan Alam was \\"stitched up\\" by fellow officers after he launched industrial tribunal proceedings in 1993, complaining of racial discrimination following a series of incidents that included a Ku Klux Klan poster being left on his desk. Cleveland Police admitted that officers suppressed evidence that lead to Mr Alam being wrongfully imprisoned for conspiracy to steal motor parts and enduring a 17-year battle to clear his name. Mr Alam, who was, as of 2012, considering a position in public office, did not believe that the force had improved and stated that racism had gone \\"underground\\", with ethnic minorities being denied the same opportunities as their white colleagues. In October 2012 the force's Chief Constable, Sean Price, was sacked after being found guilty of deceit and misconduct. He was dismissed from his ¬£190,000 a year job (one of the highest rates in the country for a Chief Constable), having been suspended in August 2011 on full pay. In May 2013, Cleveland Police agreed to pay a settlement of ¬£550,000 to James Watson, a Middlesbrough solicitor who sued them for false imprisonment after being detained for almost 30 hours. In 2019 Cleveland Police was rated inadequate in all fields, and the police watchdog accused the force of, \\"putting the public at risk.\\" There have been five chief constables since 2012. Staff described the force as, \\"directionless, rudderless and clueless\\". Vulnerable people including children were not identified and left at risk. Despite large numbers of domestic abuse victims being repeat victims offenders were not always proactively pursued. There were delays before police tried to locate youngsters reported missing. Some victims of honour-based violence and survivors allegedly had had a \\"terrible experience\\". Crime rose 17.6% in the year to 2019 but according to the watchdog, \\"crime prevention isn't a priority for the force and this is a cause of concern\\". The quality of investigations needs improvement, the watchdog maintains. High-ranking officers and staff were in many cases, \\"not taking responsibility\\" and some were \\"not acting with honesty, integrity and competence\\". Cleveland police is in the, \\"special measures\\" police equivalent, after a report showing the force failed to prevent crime, protect the public, apprehend criminals or deal with internal corruption.Britain‚Äôs first failing police force may not be the last The IndependentCleveland Police: Five key failings at crisis-hit force BBC Chief Constables *1974‚Äì1976 : Ralph Davison *1976‚Äì1990 : Christopher Payne *1990‚Äì1993 : Keith Hellawell *1993‚Äì2003 : Barry D.

Force helicopter Cleveland was a member of the North East Air Support Unit helicopter sharing agreement with neighbouring Durham Constabulary and Northumbria Police in which all three forces shared two helicopters, one based at Newcastle Airport and the other at Durham Tees Valley Airport. In 2008 Durham and Northumbria decided that just one helicopter based at Newcastle Airport would be enough. Cleveland disagreed saying that this resource would be based many miles away from Cleveland and would leave it at a disadvantage, and would not agree to the proposal. As a result, Durham and Northumbria decided to leave the consortium of the three forces, leaving Cleveland to fund its own helicopter costing ¬£500,000. On 1 April 2009, the former North East Air Support Unit agreement officially ended, and the Cleveland Air Operations Unit was formed.

A. Munch. Engraving by W. Obermann Peter Andreas Munch (15 December 1810 ‚Äì 25 May 1863), usually known as P. A. Munch, was a Norwegian historian, known for his work on the medieval history of Norway. Munch's scholarship included Norwegian archaeology, geography, ethnography, linguistics, and jurisprudence. He was also noted for his Norse legendary saga translations. Background Peter Andreas Munch was born in Christiania (now Oslo). He was the son of Edvard Storm Munch and Johanne Sophie Hofgaard. Munch was the uncle of the famous painter Edvard Munch. Munch grew up at Gjerpen parsonage, where his father was parish priest of the Church of Norway. He was schooled in the city of Skien. He attended the Royal Frederick University. Munch first studied law and took his state examination in 1834, but then turned to historical and philological studies. Career Munch's first great achievement, with Rudolph Keyser, was their three volumes of Norges Gamle Love (Norway's old laws), edited after a two-year research visit to Copenhagen. In 1837, he became lecturer in history at the University of Oslo and in 1841 became a professor of history. In 1857, after producing numerous publications, he received a large grant for archives research in Rome and lived there from 1859 to 1861. Munch served as Norway's national archivist from 1861 to 1863. He was one of the first non-Catholics to be allowed into the archives of the Vatican. He took extensive notes from the volumes of papal letters, and sometimes drew accurate facsimiles of the texts. His research there was useful in his main work, Det norske Folks Historie (History of the Norwegian People), in eight volumes, and he sent his notes home to the Royal Archives in Christiania. Among the theories he is remembered for is the theory on immigration to Norway, in which he developed work done by Rudolf Keyser. On a trip back to Rome to fetch his family, who had remained there for a while, he died from a stroke, and was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Rome. The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys In this work,P. A. Munch. The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys, Christiana (1860) Munch translated the 3rd Chronicle from a Codex transferred to the British Museum (formerly owned in 1620 by one Sir Robert Cotton). The manuscript is the only known copy of this Codex (and thought to be the only one). In any event, Munch translated runic characters and added historical notes to lend light upon the writings, and using previous works on the history of Scottish and Icelandic Isles to aid in the presentation of the translated material. Controversial views about the Finno-Ugric peoples Peter Munch had racial thoughts on certain peoples, e.g. Finns and Hungarians. He despised Finns and claimed that they cannot have an independent country because of their low state of civilization, as he claimed. Peter Munch claimed in his article on Finnish nationality (Om Finlands Nationalitet og dens Forhold til den svenske) in 1855, that Finns and Hungarians must have a human race of their own.L. A.

They are most known for their hit single \\"Poem\\" (#5 most played rock track in 2002), as well as a number of other singles from 2000 to the present. History =Formation and independent releases (1997‚Äì1999)= In 1997, Taproot sent their demo to Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Impressed with their material, he offered to get them a recording contract through Interscope Records. However, after extended negotiations, Taproot looked elsewhere, where they finally landed a lucrative record deal with Atlantic Records. Durst heavily cursed the band on vocalist Stephen Richards' answering machine.Rolling Stone, \\"Taproot Laying Down New Album\\", Posted March 6, 2002. He also put some blame on System of a Down, who assisted Taproot in securing the Atlantic deal. In retaliation, Durst also kicked System of a Down off the 1999 Family Values Tour.MTV.com, \\"Did Durst Dump System Of A Down From Family Values Tour?\\", Posted October 6, 1999. Taproot later went on to independently release three albums: ...Something More Than Nothing (1998), Mentobe (1998) and Upon Us (1999). =Gift and Welcome (2000‚Äì2004)= The band released their debut album Gift on June 27, 2000. With the album's lead single \\"Again & Again\\" gaining heavy exposure through MTV2, the band's mainstream rise gained momentum.

Prior to this time, the East River waterfront had been an active shipping yard and later became home to many of the city's poorest immigrants. The park became the largest open green space on the Lower East Side. Since that time, the park has been encroached upon by various developments such as the widening of the FDR Drive and the extension of South Street. Still, the park provides a respite for residents of the Lower East Side, particularly in summer months when there are refreshing breezes from the river. In 1998, through an agreement with the New York City Parks Department, the Lower East Side Ecology Center became the steward of the park. For 20 years, this local environmental non-profit has been the caretaker of the park and has had its offices and education center inside the Fire Boat House, located in the park near the Williamsburg Bridge. Each year the Ecology Center leads thousands of volunteers in up-keeping the park, tending to garden beds, and enhancing the park by planting native plants and bulbs. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the city rebuilt the amphitheater, which had fallen into disrepair. A new soccer field was also built at this time. Companies throughout the U.S. donated materials for the reconstruction and the project was finished in record time. The project was dedicated to those children who lost parents in the attacks. In December 2001, East River Park was renamed after former New York City Mayor John Lindsay. In 2008 the City Parks Foundation brought free music, dance, and theater arts programming to the amphitheater in an effort to further engage the surrounding communities in the revitalization of the park. The first performance held was a music concert by Fiery Furnaces which drew an audience of 1,500. KRS-One and Willie Col√≥n also performed in 2008, drawing crowds upward of 3,000 people. The East River Park is slated to be renovated between late 2020 and 2025. The project would entail raising the park by , thus providing flood protection, and was proposed after the Lower East Side was flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Original plans called for closing the park entirely from 2020 to 2023, but after protests from residents, the plans were modified in late 2019 to a partial five-year closure.

Crisp, in civilian life a commercial fisherman operating from Lowestoft in Suffolk, earned his award after being killed during the defence of his vessel, the armed naval smack Nelson, in the North Sea against an attack from a German submarine in 1917.The identity of the submarine involved in this incident has never been positively ascertained, but various sources list or . No surviving German submarines reported the incident in their logs. Crisp's self-sacrifice in the face of this \\"unequal struggle\\" was used by the government to bolster morale during some of the toughest days of the First World War for Britain, in late 1917, during which Britain was suffering heavy losses at the Battle of Passchendaele. His exploit was read aloud by David Lloyd George in the Houses of Parliament and made headline news for nearly a week. Early life Thomas Crisp was born into a family of shipwrights and fishermen in Lowestoft, one of ten children to William and Mary Anne Crisp. Although his father was the owner of a successful boatbuilding firm and thus could afford an education for his children, Thomas did not enjoy school, instead showing a \\"marked preference for quayside adventure to school routine\\".The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling, p. 180. Leaving school, Thomas took to the sea, spending several years as a herring fisherman before joining a fishing trawler out of Lowestoft. He was a natural to the work, being a remarkably good sailor, but tired of it quickly and joined the Atlantic steamship SS Mobile, becoming her quartermaster and making several trans-Atlantic voyages. Crisp with his family in about 1907 In 1895, aged 19, he met and married Harriet Elizabeth Alp and settled with her at 48 Staithe Road in Burgh St. Peter near Lowestoft, where they had two sons and a daughter, including Thomas Crisp Jr, who would be with his father on the day he won the Victoria Cross. Establishing himself as a fisherman, Thomas Sr achieved his mate and then skipper qualifications, entitling him to captain a fishing vessel sailing from the port. In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers, one of the largest boat owning families in Lowestoft, to crew and then captain their ketch George Borrow, in which he remained for thirteen years. In 1907 the family moved to Lowestoft while Crisp continued his work at sea, proving one of the most popular fishing captains in Lowestoft and joined on his ketch by his son in 1913.The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling, p. 181. When the First World War began in July 1914, Crisp was at sea. Unaware of the outbreak of war, he remained in the North Sea for several days, and was surprised on his return to learn that enemy submarines were expected off the port at any moment. When this threat failed to materialise, Thomas Crisp returned to fishing, considered too old for military service and in an occupation vital to Britain's food supplies. In late September, George Borrow passed , and shortly before they were all sunk, with over a thousand lives lost, by German U-boat . Tom Crisp Jr. later wrote of finding bodies in their fishing nets for weeks afterwards.The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling, p. 182. War service In early 1915, Tom Crisp Jr left the vessel to join the Royal Navy. A few weeks later the U-boat threat expected so many months before arrived, as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats. This offensive was part of a wider German strategy to denude Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. George Borrow was among the victims, sunk in August, although it is not known if Tom Crisp (father) was aboard at the time. While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels, which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was hoped they would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet, in the same manner as Q-ships deployed in the commercial sea lanes.Sea Heroes, Thomas Crisp VC, DSC, Hero of the Q‚ÄìShips, Suffolk Records Office, Retrieved 28 January 2007. Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by mid-1916 a Skipper in the Royal Naval Reserve, arranging for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed Smack I'll Try, armed with a 3-pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, I'll Try had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger Boy Alfred. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post-war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date.The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling, p. 183. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of ¬£200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean-going Q-ship. He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917. Victoria Cross action A UC-class coastal U-boat similar to the one that may have sunk Nelson In July, I'll Try was renamed Nelson and Boy Alfred became Ethel & Millie, in an effort to maintain their cover. The boats continued to operate together and Crisp's crew was augmented with two regular seamen and a Royal Marine rifleman, providing Nelson with a crew of ten, including Crisp and his son. The smacks set out as usual on 15 August and pulled in a catch during the morning before making a sweep near the Jim Howe Bank in search of cruising enemies. At 2.30 pm, Crisp spotted a German U-boat on the surface away. The U-boat also sighted the smack and both vessels began firing at once, the U-boat's weapon scoring several hits before Nelsons could be brought to bear. By this stage in the war, German submarine captains were aware of the decoy ship tactics and no longer stopped British merchant shipping, preferring to sink them from a distance with gunfire. With such a heavy disparity in armament between the smack's 3-pounder and the submarine's 88 mm deck gun the engagement was short lived, the submarine firing eight shots before the Nelson could get within range of her opponent. The fourth shot fired by the U-boat holed the smack, and the seventh tore off both of Crisp's legs from underneath him. Calling for the confidential papers to be thrown overboard, Crisp dictated a message to be sent by the boat's four carrier pigeons: like many small ships of the era, Nelson did not possess a radio set.Sources dispute the number of carrier pigeons carried by Nelson; Snelling states that four were released of which one reached home in good time, while the Suffolk Records Office claim that only one was carried aboard. > Nelson being attacked by submarine.

The sinking smack was abandoned by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered that he should be thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him and left him where he lay. He died in his son's arms a few minutes later.The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling, p. 178. It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him.Symbol of Courage, Max Arthur, p. 305 Ethel & Millie had just arrived on the scene as Nelson sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for Nelsons lifeboat to come alongside.Skipper Charles William Manning, Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Retrieved 22 January 2007. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink. The cenotaph memorial for Thomas Crisp VC in Lowestoft Cemetery The crew of Ethel & Millie then abandoned their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the Nelson survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of Ethel & Millie were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion at the time was that they were killed and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, as the German government had made it clear they regarded the crews of merchant ships who fought back against U-boat attacks as francs-tireurs, and thus liable to execution.Ritchie, Carson: Q-Ships, p159. (1985) These scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory is that they were taken prisoner and killed when the submarine was sunk. The son of Arthur Soanes, a sailor who disappeared in this incident,Deck Hand Arthur Soanes Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Retrieved 22 January 2007. later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a spiritual medium, reporting that he had died on board the German vessel. UC-63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels. The survivors of Nelson drifted for nearly two days until they arrived at the Jim Howe Buoy, where they were rescued by the fishery protection vessel Dryad. A pigeon named \\"Red Cock\\" had reached the authorities in Lowestoft with news of the fate of the boats and caused the Dryad to be despatched to search for survivors. A court of enquiry praised the surviving crew and their dead captain and authorised the award of the Victoria Cross posthumously to Thomas Crisp and Distinguished Service Medals to his son and another member of the crew. On 29 October 1917, David Lloyd George made an emotional speech in the House of Commons citing Crisp's sacrifice as representative of the Royal Navy's commitment \\"from the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean to the stormy floods of Magellan\\", which promoted Crisp into an overnight celebrity whose story ran in all the major London papers for nearly a week, containing as it did a story of personal sacrifice, filial devotion and perceived German barbarity.The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling, p. 175.

He was also a Knight of the Legion of Honour. Naval career George Fiott Day was born in Southampton. He joined the Royal Navy as a First Class Volunteer in 1833. His first vessel sailed to the Pacific Ocean and was wrecked off the coast of Patagonia in 1835. After serving off the west coast of Africa, in 1838 he departed for six and a half years service in the Mediterranean Sea, taking part in the bombardment of St. John d'Acre on the Syrian coast in 1840. From 1845 to 1848, he served in Africa, before departing for the Cape of Good Hope and the coast of Brazil. During the hostilities between the Argentine Confederation and Buenos Aires, he patrolled the Rivers of Paraguay and the R√≠o de la Plata. In 1854, he was sent to the Baltic Sea, and then back to the Mediterranean Fleet, and eventually to the Black Sea in 1855, where he won his Victoria Cross.

W. Dunne about his precognitive dreams and a theory of time which he later called \\"Serialism\\". First published in March 1927, the book was widely read. Although never accepted by mainstream science, it has influenced imaginative literature ever since. Dunne published four sequels: The Serial Universe, The New Immortality, Nothing Dies and Intrusions? Description =Overview= An Experiment with Time discusses two main topics. The first half of the book describes a number of precognitive dreams, most of which Dunne himself had experienced. His key conclusion was that such precognitive visions foresee future personal experiences by the dreamer and not more general events. The second half develops a theory to try and explain them. Dunne's starting point is the observation that the moment of \\"now\\" is not described by science. Contemporary science described physical time as a fourth dimension and Dunne's argument led to an endless sequence of higher dimensions of time to measure our passage through the dimension below. Accompanying each level was a higher level of consciousness. At the end of the chain was a supreme ultimate observer. According to Dunne, our wakeful attention prevents us from seeing beyond the present moment, whilst when dreaming that attention fades and we gain the ability to recall more of our timeline. This allows fragments of our future to appear in pre-cognitive dreams, mixed in with fragments or memories of our past. Other consequences include the phenomenon known as deja vu and the existence of life after death.Priestley, J.B. Man and Time, Aldus 1964 (reprinted Bloomsbury 1989). =Dreams and the experiment= Following a discussion of brain function in which Dunne expounds mind-brain parallelism and highlights the problem of subjective experience, he gives anecdotal accounts of precognitive dreams which, for the most part, he himself had experienced. The first he records occurred in 1898, in which he dreamed of his watch stopping at an exact time before waking up and finding that it had in fact done so.Dunne, J. W. An Experiment with Time. London: Faber, 1939, (fourth edition), 1927 (first edition). Later dreams appeared to foretell several major disasters; a volcanic eruption in Martinique, a factory fire in Paris, and the derailing of the Flying Scotsman express train from the embankment approaching the Forth Railway Bridge in Scotland. Dunne tells how he sought to make sense of these dreams, coming slowly to the conclusion that they foresaw events from his own future, such as reading a newspaper account of a disaster rather than foreseeing the disaster itself. In order to try and prove this to his satisfaction, he developed the experiment which gives the book its title. He kept a notepad by his bedside and wrote down details of any dreams immediately on waking, then later went back and compared them to subsequent events in his life. He also persuaded some friends to try the same experiment, as well as experimenting on himself with waking reveries approaching a hypnagogic state. Based on the results, he claimed that they demonstrated that such precognitive fragments were common in dreams, even that they were mixed up in equal occurrence with past memories, and therefore they were difficult to identify until after the event they foresaw. He believed that the dreaming mind was not drawn wholly to the present, as it was during wakefulness, but was able to perceive events in its past and future with equal facility. =The theory of Serialism= Having presented Dunne's evidence for precognition, the book moves on to a possible theory in explanation which he called Serialism.Hyman Levy; \\"Time and Perception\\", Nature, 119, No. 3006, 11 June 1927, pp847-848. doi:10.1038/119847a0: review of An Experiment with Time. The theory harks back to an experience with his nurse when he was nine years old. Already thinking about the problem, the boy asked her if Time was the moments like yesterday, today and tomorrow, or was it the travelling between them that we experience as the present moment? Any answer was beyond her, but the observation formed the basis of Serialism. Within the fixed spacetime landscape described by the recently published theory of general relativity, an observer travels along a timeline running in the direction of physical time, t1. Quantum mechanics was also a newly emerging science, though in a less-developed state. Neither relativity nor quantum mechanics offered any explanation of the observer's place in spacetime, but both required it in order to develop the physical theory around it. The philosophical problems raised by this lack of rigorous foundation were already beginning to be recognised.Sir Arthur Eddington; The Nature of the Physical World, Dent, 1935 (delivered as a lecture in 1927). The theory resolves the issue by proposing a higher dimension of Time, t2, in which our consciousness experiences its travelling along the timeline in t1. The physical brain itself inhabits only t1, requiring a second level of mind to inhabit t2 and it is at this level that the observer experiences consciousness. However, Dunne found that his logic led to a similar difficulty with t2 in that the passage between successive events in t2 was not included in the model. This led to an even higher t3 in which a third-level observer could experience not just the mass of events in t2 but the passage of those experiences in t2, and so on in the infinite regress of time dimensions and observers which gives the theory its name. Dunne suggested that when we die, it is only our physical selves in t1 who die and that our higher selves are outside of mundane time. Our conscious selves therefore have no mechanism to die in the same kind of way and are effectively immortal. At the end of the chain he proposed a \\"superlative general observer, the fount of all ... consciousness\\".Dunne, J.W. An Experiment with Time, First Edition, A.C. Black, 1927, Page 207. Reception =Academic reception= Philosophers who criticised An Experiment with Time included Hyman Levy in Nature, J. A. Gunn, C. D. Broad and M. F. Cleugh. Opinions differed over the existence of dream precognition, while his infinite regress was universally judged to be logically flawed and incorrect.Hyman Levy; \\"Time and Perception\\" (review of An Experiment with Time), Nature, 119, No. 3006, 11 June 1927, pp847-848.J.

In 1981 a new impression of the 1934 (third) edition was published with an introduction by the writer and broadcaster Brian Inglis. The last (1948) edition was reprinted in 1981 with an introduction by the physicist and parapsychologist Russell Targ. A review of it in New Scientist described it as a \\"definitive classic\\".John Gribbin; Book Review of An Experiment with Time New Scientist 27 Aug 1981, p. 548 Mainstream scientific opinion remains that, while Dunne was an entertaining writer, there is no scientific evidence for either dream precognition or more than one time dimension and his arguments do not convince.Evans, Christopher; Landscapes of the Night: How and Why We Dream, Viking, 1983.Paul Davies; About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution, Viking, 1995. =Popular reception= An Experiment with Time became well known and was widely discussed. Not to have read him became a \\"mark of singularity\\" in society. Critical essays on Serialism, both positive and negative, appeared in popular works: H. G. Wells included \\"New Light on mental Life\\" in his collection of articles Way The World is Going, J. B. Priestley gave an accessible account in his study Man and Time and Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short essay, \\"Time and J. W. Dunne\\", which was later included in his anthology Other Inquisitions. Sequels Besides issuing new editions of An Experiment with Time, Dunne also published several sequels exploring different aspects of Serialism. The Serial Universe (1934) examined its relation to current physics in relativity and quantum mechanics. The New Immortality (1938) and Nothing Dies (1940) explored the metaphysical aspect of Serialism, especially in relation to immortality. Intrusions? (1955) contained autobiographical accounts of the angelic visions and voices which had accompanied many of his precognitive dreams. It was incomplete at the time of his death in 1949, being completed with the help of his family and finally published some years later. It also revealed that he believed himself to be a spiritual medium. He had deliberately chosen to leave this material out of An Experiment with Time as he judged that it would have affected the scientific reception of his theory.Ruth Brandon Scientists and the supernormal New Scientist 16 June 1983 p. 786 Literary influence The popularity of An Experiment with Time was also reflected in the many authors who have since referenced him and his ideas in numerous literary works of fiction. He \\"undoubtedly helped to form something of the imaginative climate of those [interwar] years\\".Stewart, V.; \\"J. W. Dunne and literary culture in the 1930s and 1940s\\", Literature and History, Volume 17, Number 2, Autumn 2008, pp. 62-81, Manchester University Press.Anon,; \\"Obituary: Mr. J. W. Dunne, Philosopher and Airman\\", The Times, August 27, 1949, Page 7. One of the first and most significant writers was J. B. Priestley, who based three of his \\"Time plays\\" around them: Time and the Conways, Dangerous Corner and An Inspector Calls. The ideas of Dunne also strongly influenced the unfinished novels The Notion Club Papers by J. R. R. Tolkien and The Dark Tower by C. S. Lewis. Tolkien and Lewis were both members of the Inklings literary circle. Tolkien also used Dunne's ideas about parallel time dimensions in developing the relationship between time in Middle-earth and \\"L√≥rien time\\".Flieger, V.; A Question of Time: JRR Tolkien's Road to Faerie, Kent State University Press, 1997. Lewis used the imagery of serialism in the afterlife he depicted at the end of The Last Battle, the closing tale in the Chronicles of Narnia.Inchbald, Guy; \\"The Last Serialist: C.S. Lewis and J.W. Dunne\\", Mythlore Issue 137, Vol. 37 No. 2, Spring/Summer 2019, pp. 75-88. Other important contemporary writers who used his ideas included John Buchan (The Gap in the Curtain), James Hilton (Random Harvest), his old friend H. G. Wells (The Queer Story of Brownlow‚Äôs Newspaper and The Shape of Things to Come), Graham Greene (The Bear Fell Free) and Rumer Godden (A Fugue in Time).Dermot Gilvary; Dangerous Edges of Graham Greene: Journeys with Saints and Sinners, Continuum, 2011, p.101.Victoria Stewart; \\"An Experiment with Narrative?

Nixon. Early life He was born October 4, 1908, in Glens Falls, New York. He graduated at the age of fourteen from St. Mary's Academy. An essay that discussed the dangers faced by coal miners was published in the Glens Falls Post Star. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and seminary at the Sulpician seminary of the Catholic University of America, where he earned bachelor's degrees in philosophy and sacred theology, and a master's degree in philosophy. In 1932, Cronin was ordained at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Albany, New York by Bishop Edmund F. Gibbons. He joined the Sulpicians, and in 1935, was awarded a doctorate in philosophy by Catholic University. Career =Teacher= Cronin taught economics at St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore, Maryland. While there, he published a pamphlet, A Living Wage Today, that built on Pope Pius XI's encyclical, Quadragesimo Anno, and declared, \\"The wage paid to the workingman must be sufficient for the support of himself and of his family.\\" In 1938, Archbishop Michael J. Curley of Baltimore asked Father Cronin to establish a School of Social Action to instruct Catholic clergy in the church's teachings on labor, which was later expanded to parishes. According to John T. Donovan, Cronin's writing and teaching helped to sharpen his skills in the area of labor and economics. He was also Assistant Director of the Department of Social Action for the National Catholic Welfare Conference. =Anticommunist= Around the end of the Second World War, Cronin wrote a report for the bishops on the Communist Party of the United States. He had the assistance of FBI officials, who unofficially provided some of the background material for him. When Richard Nixon was elected to Congress in 1946, he sought out information on Communism, and he was introduced to Cronin by Representative Charles J. Kersten (R.WI). By early February 1947, U.S. Representative Charles J. Kersten had taken the newly elected Richard M. Nixon on several trips to Baltimore to meet with Cronin. At that time, Cronin shared with Nixon his 1945 privately circulated paper \\"The Problem of American Communism in 1945\\", with much information from the FBI's William C. Sullivan (who by 1961 would head domestic intelligence under Hoover). By May 1948, Nixon had co-sponsored a \\"Mundt-Nixon Bill\\" to implement \\"a new approach to the complicated problem of internal communist subversion... It provided for registration of all Communist Party members and required a statement of the source of all printed and broadcast material issued by organizations that were found to be Communist fronts.\\" On May 19, 1948, the bill passed the House by 319 to 58 but failed to pass the Senate. (The Nixon Library cites this bill's passage as Nixon's first significant victory in Congress.) During August 1948, Nixon pushed for further investigation of Alger Hiss based on allegations made early that month before the HUAC by Whittaker Chambers: his persistence helped pave the way for the subsequent Hiss Case with two trials in 1949 and a verdict against Hiss in January 1950. In his paper \\"The Problem of American Communism In 1945\\", Cronin wrote, \\"In the State Department, the most influential Communist has been Alger Hiss.\\"John F. Cronin, S.S., \\"The Problem of American Communism in 1945,\\" p. 49 (PDF p. 58) When Whittaker Chambers testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in August 1948 and said that Hiss was a Communist, Nixon had already known about the charge from his conversations with Cronin. After Nixon was elected Vice President, he asked Cronin for help in writing speeches, who became an unpaid assistant to Nixon; Cronin wrote the first draft of Nixon's 1956 acceptance speech at the Republican Convention in San Francisco.Donovan, John T. Crusader in the Cold War, Peter Lang Publishing, 2005 He authored the book Communism: A World Menace. However, despite his strong opposition to Communism, Cronin criticized Joseph McCarthy and similar anticommunists in the United States, whom he accused of fostering national disunity. =Civil rights activist= In the 1950s and 1960s, he strongly supported the civil rights in America. He wrote two of the bishops' statements on race relations and lobbied them to see that they accepted the drafts.  Works  * Economics and Society (1941)\\"Dr. John F.

The Shirley area is split into Shirley proper (centred on Wickham Road), Shirley Oaks (to the north) and Upper Shirley (to the west); the suburbs of Monks Orchard and Spring Park are sometimes also considered to be sub-districts of Shirley.Willey, Russ. Chambers London Gazetteer, p 439  History  The name Shirley, first recorded in 1314, is thought to mean 'shire clearing', referring to its position adjacent to the traditional Kent-Surrey border, though it may instead mean 'bright clearing'. It was long a small hamlet, with a large mansion (Shirley House) being built here in 1721; this was purchased by John Maberley in the mid-1800s. Around this period the population was growing, with more housing being built. St John's Church was built in 1856 to serve the needs of the growing community, replacing a smaller chapel dating from 1835. Shirley House was converted into the Shirley Park Hotel in 1912. In the 1930s house building in the area rapidly expanded, largely consisting of suburban-style semi-detached houses, with the Monks Orchard estate also being built in this period. However some land escaped the building boom; Shirley Park Hotel was bought by the Whitgift Foundation in 1965 to become Trinity School in a new building constructed on the site. Neighbouring the Whitgift School grounds is Shirley Park Golf Course. To the south of Shirley are large areas of woodland, including Addington Hills and Threehalfpenny Wood. Parks and open spaces are dotted across the area, including Miller‚Äôs Pond in Spring Park. Central Shirley (along Wickham Road) contains a library, several shops and restaurants, and two pubs - The Crown, and the Shirley Inn. Shirley Oaks Shirley Oaks Hospital, built on the site of the former Children's Home Shirley Oaks is situated north of central Shirley, abutting Monks Orchard. The land here was traditionally the property of the archbishop of Canterbury. The area gets its name from Oaks Farm, which lay here circa 1800. The area began to be developed in the early 20th century, with the opening of the Shirley Oaks Children's Home in 1903. Following the closure of the Home in 1982, the site was demolished and replaced with modern housing by Heron Homes. Part of the site was set aside for Shirley Oaks Hospital, a private healthcare centre which opened in 1986. =Shirley Oaks Children Home= The Shirley Oaks Children's Home opened in 1903 and was run by the London Borough of Lambeth until its closure in 1982. It was the largest in the country. The children's home consisted of 38 cottages on a site; it contained its own school. In 2014 allegations of abuse emerged, and the Shirley Oaks survivors association (SOSA) was set up. Between then and 2020, 1,760 people have described suffering sexual, physical and racial abuse while at the home. Children were \\"drugged, tortured and sexually assaulted.\\"\\"Shirley Oaks: Children 'drugged, tortured and sexually assaulted',\\" BBC, 30 June 2020. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse \\"heard that despite widespread mistreatment of children, the authority (Lambeth Council) failed to investigate any allegations at the time.\\"\\"Shirley Oaks: 'Hundreds of children racially and sexually abused',\\" BBC, 29 June 2020. The Metropolitan police inquiry, Operation Midland, which examined all the borough's children‚Äôs homes, concluded at least 35 men and women had abused children over a 20-year period. SOSA believes that over a 60-year period, over 120 abusers were involved. To compensate victims of the abuse at Shirley Oaks (and also Lambeth Children‚Äôs Home), Lambeth Council has set up a Redress Scheme open until January 2022. The scheme is assisted by child abuse lawyers Ann Olivarius and Jeff Anderson of AO Advocates. As of January 2020, ¬£30.7 million has been paid directly to victims.\\"Lambeth Children‚Äôs Homes Redress Scheme Update,\\" Lambeth Council, January 2020. Upper Shirley The Shirley Windmill Upper Shirley is situated to the south-west of Shirley proper and is centred on the junction of Upper Shirley Road and Oaks Road, adjacent to the Addington Hills and Shirley Park and Addington golf courses. The settlement is thought to have originated in the mid-18th century, originally under the name 'Badger's Hole'. The area was home to a brewery in the mid-18th century. In 1865 the Surprise pub opened. There was another pub in the area - The Sandrock - which was located at the junction of Upper Shirley Road with Sandpits Road, which closed in 2018. The area is largely affluent, especially along Bishops Walk. = Shirley Windmill = Upper Shirley's most prominent landmark is the tower mill, which was built by Richard Alwen to replace the first mill on the site (built by his grandfather William Alwen in 1808) after it was burnt by fire in 1854. By 1893, Alfred Rayson, the owner, was forced to abandon the mill as unviable. After closure the mill was allowed to deteriorate, being struck by lightning in 1899 and again in 1906. In 1951 the mill and land were acquired by the Croydon Corporation. The mill was threatened with demolition when the new John Ruskin School was built but it was protected by its Grade II listed statusShirley Windmill at the British Listed Buildings website and strong public interest. The school, now the John Ruskin College, later left the site and housing was built around the mill. In August 1996, it was announced that the London Borough of Croydon was to receive a grant of ¬£218,100 from the Heritage Lottery Fund for the mill. The grant money has helped restore the mill to working order and open it to the public. Shirley Windmill is open to the public on the first Sunday of each month June to October open in May on National Mills weekend (Sunday) and usually open for the annual Open House Weekend (Sunday) in September.

In 2011, it dissolved and merged into the National Alliance. The party was founded from smaller groups in 1993 as 'For Fatherland and Freedom' (TB), with a focus on promoting the Latvian language and putting a cap on naturalisation of Latvian Non-citizens. It won six Saeima seats in its first year, and 14 in 1995, when it entered the governing centre-right coalition. It merged with the moderate Latvian National Independence Movement (LNNK) in 1997, and moved its emphasis to economic liberalisation. TB/LNNK's then-leader, Guntars Krasts, was Prime Minister from 1997 to 1998. It remained in government until 2004, and again from 2006. Initially from the nationalist right, the party become more moderate after the 1997 merger. It also shifted from supporting economic interventionism to the free market. A predominantly ethnic Latvian party, the party's support base was university-educated, middle class, and concentrated in Riga. The party was soft eurosceptic, and was a member of the anti-federalist Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists. Its only MEP, party leader Roberts Zƒ´le, sat with the ECR group in the European Parliament. It has caused some controversy with its participation in the Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires processions. For the 2010 parliamentary election, the party formed an alliance with the nationalist All For Latvia!. In July 2011, both parties merged into a unitary party, bearing the name National Alliance. History =Foundation= The roots of the party were in the 'Third Awakening' of the Latvian independence movement in the late 1980s. It identified with the part of the movement, which insisted on a full restoration of independence for Latvia and legal continuity with the Republic of Latvia that existed until 1940, when it was annexed by the Soviet Union.Plakans (1997), p. 272 It was closely affiliated with the Citizens' Congress through which an alternative government was created that claimed lineage from the interwar government. Within this structure, parties developed which continued after the restoration of independence in 1991. Two of these parties, the '18th November Union' and 'Fatherland', merged in 1993 to form the centre-right 'For Fatherland and Freedom' ( or TB).Plakans (1997), p. 281 The new party took its name from the inscription on the Freedom Monument, and its focus was on undoing the effects of the Soviet occupation, especially promoting the Latvian language and tightening citizenship laws. The party took part in the 1993 election to the Saeima, and won six seats. A party with a similar background, the Latvian National Independence Movement (LNNK), won fifteen seats. =Merger and referenda= TB was the leading force behind two referendum proposals (in 1994 and 1998) to make Latvian citizenship laws stricter. In 1994, the proposition did not gather the necessary number of voter signatures. Before the 1995 election, TB signed a prospective coalition agreement, the centre-right 'National Bloc', with the LNNK and the Latvian Farmers' Union,Plakans (1997), pp. 281‚Äì2 and presented a more rounded programme, based on the LNNK's,Berglund (2004), p. 117 although still concentrating on national identity issues. The party jumped to fourteen seats, becoming one of the four major parties in the Saeima, and leap-frogging the LNNK (which suffered a split from the secession of the populist right under Joachim Siegerist) as the main right-wing party. The party fell just short of a majority, with leader MƒÅris Grƒ´nblats's right- wing coalition securing the support of 49 out of 100 deputies for the premiership.Plakans (1997), p. 282 Instead, a broad centre-right coalition was formed with TB controlling four ministries under PM Andris ≈†ƒ∑ƒìle.Plakans (1997), p. 283 In 1997, the TB merged with the LNNK to form 'For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK', also known as the 'Conservative Union'. In 1998, the proposal was defeated in a referendum, by a relatively small margin (45% of voters supporting the change and 52% rejecting it). At the end of the 1990s and the early 2000s, the party shifted its focus to economic issues. =Government= Roberts Zƒ´le, party leader from 2006‚Äì2011 served in the government from 1997 to 2004, and was TB/LNNK's candidate for Prime Minister in 2006 and 2010. \\"For Fatherland and Freedom\\" was a part of coalition governments from December 1995 to February 2004. From 1997 to 1998, its representative, Guntars Krasts, was the prime minister. From February 2004 until November 2006, the party was in opposition. Although it only gained 8 seats in the 2006 election, the party was invited to become part of the ruling coalition, and it agreed to join. \\"For Fatherland and Freedom\\" campaigned as a strong supporter of Latvia's national interests and opponent of a federal Europe. \\"For Fatherland and Freedom\\" won 29% of votes and 4 of Latvia's 9 seats in the 2004 European Parliament election. In the 2009 European election, the party lost most of its support, falling from nearly 30% to 7.5%, resulting in the loss of 3 of its 4 European seats.Latvian Central Election Commission The party attempted to join the centre-right Unity electoral alliance in 2010, but was rejected. Instead it joined with the more nationalist All For Latvia! (VL) in the National Alliance (NacionƒÅlƒÅ Apvienƒ´ba). In the 2010 election, the Alliance won eight seats, with VL winning six of them and TB/LNNK reduced to two. In July 2011, both components of the National Alliance agreed to intensify their links and to re-organize the National Alliance as a unitary party under the same name. On TB/LNNK's 17th and last delegate conference, 84 of 90 party representatives agreed with the merger, 3 opposed and 3 abstained.TB/LNNK 17. kongresa lƒìmums par Apvienƒ´bas reorganizƒÅciju (17th TB/LNNK congress decides to re-organize alliance), in Latvian Ideology Constitutionally, the party treated the post-1991 Republic of Latvia not as a successor to the inter-war republic, but as a continuation,Smith-Silvertsen (2004), p. 72 and considered all acts of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic illegitimate. The party opposed the naturalisation of the large population of Soviet-era migrants () that live in Latvia. The party's stance towards the Soviet era lead Guntars Krasts's government to make the Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires a public holiday, and its members to celebrate the Latvian Legion, part of the Waffen-SS. The party was an advocate of the free market. The party's position shifted over time from interventionism to liberalisation. Originally, the party based its Statism on the heavy interventionism of the inter-war republic.Eglitis (2002), p. 103 Of TB/LNNK's predecessors, For Fatherland and Freedom was more sceptical of the free market, while the LNNK supported full privatisation, within the context of a welfare state and protectionism.Eglitis (2002), p. 69 After the merger, the party adopted free market economics as one of its main emphases, advocating a swift transition to a market economy. The party held an anti-federal, soft eurosceptic position. It was the only centre-right party to have flirted with opposing membership of the European Union before Latvian accession. In March 2003, it changed to supporting membership, fearing that voting no would cause the country to lose support for economic reforms and security policy. The party campaigned in favour of accession in the November 2003 referendum. The party was a strong advocate for the Latvian language. For example, it introduced a law mandating the public sector to ignore communication in any other language. At the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance high-level panel meeting in 2005, Jean-Yves Camus, a French political scientist, described the party as \\"on the borderline between conservative right and far-right\\" and \\"an ultra-nationalist party comparable in some respects to the far right\\".The use of racist, antisemitic and xenophobic elements in political discourse High-level panel meeting on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Paris, 21 March 2005. ECRI: 2005. ‚Äî p. 20, p. 44 Political support A major cleavage in Latvian politics is between ethnic Latvians, from whom TB/LNNK received almost all of its votes, and ethnic Russians. In the 1998 election, ethnic Latvians were fifteen times as likely to vote for the party as ethnic Russians.Smith-Silvertsen (2004), p. 108 The 1998 referendum on citizenship sponsored by TB/LNNK was supported by a majority of Latvians, but defeated overall by opposition from ethnic Russians. The party was supported mostly by the middle class,Smith-Silvertsen (2004), p. 98 with wealthier voters tending to vote either for TB/LNNK or Latvian Way.Smith-Silvertsen (2004), p. 113 Before the parties merged in 1997, both TB and the LNNK received the most support from university graduates.Smith-Silvertsen (2004), p. 114 Riga was traditionally the party's strongest area, with 40% of its voters in 1995 coming from the capital city.Smith-Silvertsen (2004), p. 110 However, Riga's politics are shifting from an ethno-linguistic cleavage to a socio-economic one, leading to a softening of this disparity in the 2001 municipal election. Unlike most parties in Latvia, TB/LNNK never based its support on having a particularly populist leader. International relations and criticism The party was a member of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR), allying with amongst others, the British Conservative Party, Polish Law and Justice, and the Czech Civic Democratic Party. They sat with the AECR's group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, in the European Parliament. Until 2009, TB/LNNK was a member of the Alliance for Europe of the Nations and sat with the UEN group. In 2009, British foreign secretary David Miliband criticized Conservative Chairman Eric Pickles' decision to secure an alliance with TB/LNNK in the ECR group \\"despite the fact that its members attend commemorations for the Waffen-SS\\".David Miliband's speech showed rare passion ‚Äì this was powerful stuff, The Guardian In a response, William Hague demanded an apology be made to TB/LNNK and the Latvian government from Miliband, describing his remarks as recycling \\"false Soviet propaganda\\" and noting that \\"the majority of parties forming Latvia‚Äôs current Government including the Prime Minister‚Äôs party, have attended the commemoration of Latvians who fought in the Second World War\\". The Israeli historian and Nazi- hunter Efraim Zuroff, head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's office in Jerusalem, criticized the party's \\"obsession with paying public homage to the Latvian-SS Legion in contradiction to all historical logic and sensitivity to Nazi crimes\\" in a column for The Guardian on 28 September 2009,Zuroff, Efraim. \\"The Nazi Whitewash\\".

The vessel's keel was laid down on 23 August 1985 by Versatile Pacific Shipyards Limited at their yard in Vancouver, British Columbia with the yard number 110. The ship was launched on 3 January 1987, named after Henry Larsen, the commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrol vessel which was the first vessel to traverse the Northwest Passage in a single season. The ship entered service with the Canadian Coast Guard on 29 June 1988. Henry Larsen, besides icebreaking duties along Atlantic Canada, provides search and rescue support, ship escort in iced-up areas in southern Canada during the winter and in Arctic waters in the summer and supports scientific research.

Biography Smyth was born at Naples, the son of Admiral W H Smyth and his wife Annarella Warington. His father was engaged in the Admiralty Survey of the Mediterranean at the time of his birth. Smyth was educated at Westminster School and Bedford School. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Cambridge crew in the 1839 Boat Race and graduated BA in 1839. Having gained a travelling scholarship he spent more than four years in Europe, Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt, paying great attention to mineralogy and mining, examining coal-fields, metalliferous mines and salt-works, and making acquaintance with many distinguished geologists and mineralogists. Geological Survey Carreg Pumsaint at Dolaucothi examined by Smyth On his return to England in 1844 Smyth was appointed mining geologist in the Geological Survey, and in 1851 lecturer at the Royal School of Mines, a post which he held until 1881 when he relinquished the chair of mineralogy but continued as professor of mining. In later years he became chief mineral inspector to the Office of Woods and Forests, and also to the Duchy of Cornwall. He investigated the Roman gold mine at Dolaucothi and published a short paper on his observations in 1846 in Memoirs of the Geological Survey. Subsequently, he gave lectures on gold mining as a result of the then gold rushes in California and Australia in the 1850s. Smyth was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1858. He became president of the Geological Society of London in 1866-1868, and in 1879 he was chairman of a Royal Commission appointed to inquire into coal mine accidents, the work in connection with which continued until 1886. He contributed sundry papers to the Memoirs of the Geological Survey, the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society and the Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, serving as RGSC President from 1871-1879, and again from 1883-1890. He was also author of A Year with the Turks (1854), and of A Treatise on Coal and Coal-mining (1867). He was knighted in 1887. He was also a Knight of the Italian Order of SS. Maurizio and Lazzaro and of the Portuguese Order of Jesus Christ. Smyth died in his London home in Inverness Terrace, Bayswater, on 19 June 1890, but was buried at St Erth, not far from his country home at Marazion in Cornwall. He is commemorated by a wall plaque in Truro Cathedral, where he had been a founding member of the building committee responsible for its construction. Smyth married Anna Maria Antonia Maskelyne, daughter of Anthony Mervin Story Maskelyne, of Basset Down House, Wiltshire on 9 April 1864. One son, Herbert Warington Smyth, was also a mining engineer, a traveller, and a Geological Survey adviser to the government of Siam.

They were the Pennine Radio, Viking Radio and Radio Hallam's medium wave franchises. These stations were part of the Yorkshire Radio Network. History It was originally formed when Viking Radio split its frequencies and turned its medium wave service into \\"Viking Gold\\" on 31 October 1988; at the time this was group's first oldies station. Pennine and Hallam soon followed on 1 May 1989 and a network was formed calling itself Classic Gold. For most of its life, Classic Gold was produced with a presenter in Hull, and local 'tech-ops' in Bradford and Sheffield. In Bradford two sets of adverts would be played out - one for Bradford and one for the Halifax/Huddersfield transmitter. Tech-ops included Paul Bromley, Rol Hirst, Melanie Robinson, Richard Hizzard, James Cridland, Colin Bates and Peter Carter. Part of the tech-op's duties would also be to drive the desk for the news readers - the first three minutes of which were taken by the FM station, while Classic Gold listeners got a full five minutes of news. Tech-ops were instructed by talk-back from the presenter studio in Hull what the 'out-cue' was going to be. Breaks were balanced by the tech-op, not by the scheduling department. A tale about Keith Skues was that he would give an out-cue of \\"time-check\\", and would then announce \\"the time is three little ducks\\". This was followed by a long pause, causing the local tech-ops to fire off the ad-break once they'd realised it was 2:22pm. The talkback was some kind of radio link, and occasionally was interfered with by Hull taxis. A stand-by CD was in satellite studios in case of line failure; in Bradford, the dulcet tones of Nina Simone's \\"My baby just cares for me\\" meant the line had gone dead. In the early 1990s GWR Group which had just bought 2CR and 210 took YRN's Classic Gold from midnight till 6am, which then became Brunel, 2CR Classic Gold etc. The name was used in Yorkshire by YRN some 12 months before the GWR group. After being taken over by the Metro Radio group in the early 90s, Alan Ross then Programme Controller of Classic Gold, moved to Pennine FM to launch The Pulse (now of Magic 1170),Classic Gold was relaunched as \\"Great Yorkshire Radio\\", later \\"Great Yorkshire Gold\\". The station continued in all three areas, even after the sale of the Bradford-based station (along with its FM sister station The Pulse of West Yorkshire) to the Radio Partnership in 1996. This had occurred because Radio Authority rules at the time prevented Emap from owning stations in Leeds and Bradford which had significant overlap. In 1997 promotional trailers began running across all three Great Yorkshire Gold stations saying that they would be soon changing to become Magic, despite the fact that this would not be the case in West Yorkshire, where negotiations were underway to take GWR plc's Classic Gold service. Unhappy with the confusion being caused to listeners, bosses in Bradford decided to create an emergency local service whilst the talks continued with GWR plc and 1278 and 1530 AM West Yorkshire ran for a couple of weeks before Classic Gold was put to air. The Classic Gold brand continued in West Yorkshire until 2007 (apart from a brief period when the station became Big AM), when it was rebranded as Pulse Gold taking programming from the GCap-owned \\"Gold\\" network; being relaunched again the following year (2008) as Pulse 2. Programming Each station had its own, local breakfast show presenter - in Bradford it was Roger Kirk, in Hull it was Chris Bell and in Sheffield it was Gerry Kersey (now at BBC Radio Sheffield). Network programming began at 9.00am, with Alan Ross on mornings, and Keith Skues on lunchtimes. Peter Fairhead was also a regular presenter. Local programmes took over after Drivetime at 7.00pm, with sports programmes and specialist music. For example, on the West Yorkshire frequencies in 1989 there were brass band programmes, cookery descriptions, old dance music, computer technology shows and 'music from the hippy era' presented by Nigel Schofield. Weekends included a large amount of local programming which on Saturdays included the breakfast show with Terry Pierce and Kenelm James and the morning show with Brian Cooke and Gregory Sammons, Sundays included religious programming with local clergy (Bradford had Martin Short and Daniel Croft as one of their presenters), and sports programming, including Rugby with Iain Williamson and football with Chris Cooper and Dan Ackroyd. Branding The Classic Gold jingles were re-sings of classic PAMS jingles, making the station sound more like an offshore pirate of the 60s - a sound familiar to Programme Director Keith Skues - himself a veteran of Radio Caroline and Radio London. The station even had its own version of the \\"Sonovox waltz\\" as used by Radio London, this was heard usually every hour just before the news. Alan Ross researched 'Oldies Radio' and the use of jingles, by studying the output of 'Cool 105.9' - a Solid Gold radio station based in Florida. The Great Yorkshire Radio jingles were re-sings of the Great North Radio package produced by Alfasound, they also used the same slogans.(40 Years of Hits) At this time the station logo used the same font style as its sister station GNR too.

The mountain was named in 1886 for George Stephen, the first president of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The mountain is mainly composed of shales and dolomites from the Cambrian Period, some 550 million years ago. The Stephen Formation, a stratigraphical unit of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin was first described at the mountain and was named for it. Stephen has a subpeak known as Stephen SE1, at the end of a 1 km ridge, 132‚Å∞ from the main peak, visible from Lake O'Hara.  Climbing  The first ascent was made on September 9, 1887 by James. J. McArthur and his assistant T. Riley, which was made even more difficult by the surveying equipment they also carried with them. Unfortunately for them, smoke from forest fires limited visibility from the top. Beginning at 4:30 am, it took them four hours to pierce dense forest to reach tree line. After another three hours, the final rocks were reached which bore the inscription \\"Hill, Whatley, Ross, September 6, 1886\\". Above the rocks, they had to navigate an ice couloir and a knife-edged arete before reaching the summit. Sometime between this ascent and one in 1892, an estimated of rock had fallen in the upper section of the mountain, making the climb notably easier. The main route (a scramble) ascends slopes on the southwest face but requires much route finding and the final section of to the top is rated difficult. A cornice on the summit may prevent parties from reaching the top so if in doubt of conditions, attempts should wait until August. The route also passes through a fossil bed and thus requires a special park permit to be in the area. The elevation gain is . For rock climbers, a route on the north ridge is rated III 5.7 with generally good rock formations composed mainly of quartzite. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Stephen is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below -30 ¬∞C. Weather conditions during winter make Mount Stephen one of the better places in the Rockies for ice climbing. Precipitation runoff from Mount Stephen drains into the Kicking Horse River.

Biography Titus was born in West Hartford, Connecticut, attended Yale and graduated in 1757. He read for the law, was admitted to the bar, and began a practice in Middletown, Connecticut. Hosmer was elected to the Connecticut State Assembly annually from 1773 to 1778, and served as their speaker in 1777. In May 1778 he became a member of the State Senate, and remained in that office until he died. Later in 1778, the joint state legislature also sent him as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. He was subsequently elected by the Continental Congress on January 22, 1780 to serve as a federal judge on the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture.Library of Congress, Journals of the Continental Congress, Vol. 16, 79. Titus died at Middletown on August 4, 1780 of undisclosed causes, and is buried in the Mortimer Cemetery there. Joel Barlow, who received Titus's patronage, wrote a much-admired elegy on Titus's death. Family Titus Hosmer married Lydia Lord on November 29, 1761, in Middletown. One son, Stephen Hosmer, would also become a lawyer, and was the Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court. The other son, Hezekiah Lord Hosmer (1765‚Äì1814), became a U. S. representative for New York State. A grandson, also named Hezekiah Lord Hosmer (1814‚Äì1893), became the first Chief Justice of the Montana Territory and authored several books. The Hosmer family is traced to Rotherfield in Sussex (and much earlier to Otterhampton, Somerset), where a certain Alexander Hosmer was native before a marian martyr in nearby Lewes and the family consequently moved to Kent in the following generations. His colonial ancestor, Col. Thomas Titus, was a Roundhead in the New Model Army, who left Hawkhurst in Kent for Boston upon the English Restoration. Thomas Titus later settled in Middletown. He had a Whig relative who fought and was mortally wounded in the Battle of Lexington and Concord against Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland. There is a Hosmer Corner in Hampden County, Massachusetts named for the family although the Hosmers are more renowned as founders of Hartford Connecticut.

Family and early life Born in Drumcondra, Dublin, Coghill was the eldest son of Sir John Joscelyn Coghill (1826‚Äì1905), 4th Baronet, JP, DL, of Drumcondra, Co. Dublin (see Coghill baronets), and his wife, the Hon. Katherine Frances Plunket, daughter of John Plunket, 3rd Baron Plunket. He was a nephew of David Plunket, 1st Baron Rathmore and William Plunket, 4th Baron Plunket. The painter Sir Egerton Coghill, 5th Baronet (who had a son also called Nevill named in his honour) was his younger brother. Coghill was educated at Haileybury College from 1865-69Haileybury Website - Details of military medals In 1876 he set sail with the 24th Regiment of Foot to Cape. Battle of Isandlwana Memorial to Coghill and Melvill Coghill was twenty-five years old and a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later the South Wales Borderers), British Army, during the Zulu War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. He was an orderly officer to Colonel Glyn, who regarded him as his favourite officer and the son he never had. On 22 January 1879, after the disaster of the Battle of Isandhlwana, South Africa, Lieutenant Coghill joined another officer (Teignmouth Melvill)http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/24705/pages/2676 who was trying to save the Queen's Colour of the Regiment. They were pursued by Zulu warriors, and while crossing the swollen River Buffalo, Lieutenant Coghill (despite his injured knee) went to the rescue of his brother officer, who had lost his horse and was in great danger. Although Coghill's horse was shot by a Zulu warrior, the valiant soldier swam on to rescue Melvill. After some time, the Colours were swept from their grasp and floated down the bank. After reaching the bank, the two men were eventually overtaken by the Zulu warriors and, following a short struggle, both were killed.http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol016db.html Lieutenant Walter Higginson, who was persuaded to escape, heard and witnessed their final actions when they fought to the last. Legacy and Award of Victoria Cross Two weeks after the battle, Coghill and Melvill's bodies were found by a search party and both buried at Fugitive's Drift. Coghill's father donated his son's trophies including a Zulu shield to the Museum of Science and Art, which is currently the National Museum of Ireland. Coghill and Melvill were amongst the first soldiers to receive the VC posthumously in 1907. Initially the London Gazette mentioned that had they survived they would have been awarded the VC. \\"The Last Sleep of the Brave\\" the Bodies of Coghill and Mevill are found (an Oleograph after Alphonse de Neuville 1881.) A few months after the Battle of Isandlwana, a French battle artist, Alphonse de Neuville painted Coghill and Mevill's actions when they were pursued by Zulu warriors. Major-General Dillon informed Coghill's father in a letter, that had it not been for the valour of his son, the Colours would have fallen to Zulu hands. Coghill was portrayed by Christopher Cazenove in the 1979 film Zulu Dawn as a polite and humorous officer. In the film, he is friends with Melvill; their heroic actions when they crossed the Buffalo River in a desperate attempt to return the Queen's Colours back to Natal was depicted in the film. Coghill's great-great-great grand-niece, Jane Mann studied History at Oxford University. In 2014, 135 years after the Battle of Isandlwana, Mann passed the painting (of her ancestor and Melvill pursued by Zulus) by military artist Jason Askew to the Victoria Cross Museum. In the end the Colours, which Coghill and Mevill tried to save were recovered and are currently on display at Brecon Cathedral in remembrance of their valour as well as other soldiers killed during the battle. Coghill's Victoria Cross is permanently displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon, Powys, Wales. He is now commemorated by a leadership programme named in his honour at Haileybury College for pupils in Removes.

It is home to the Public Theater's free Shakespeare in the Park productions. Over five million people have attended more than 150 free productions of Shakespeare and other classical works and musicals at the Delacorte Theater since its opening in 1962. History The theater is named in honor of Valerie and George T. Delacorte, Jr., who donated money for its establishment, after several seasons presented by Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Workshop (founded in 1954) had been touring New York's boroughs on temporary staging and had proved the venture worthwhile. Papp had started seeking funds in 1958 for a permanent outdoor amphitheater in Central Park, under the aegis of Helen Hayes. Papp believed theater was essential for all to experience, and that it should be free for all. These conceits, and Papp's personal drive and determination, are what propelled Shakespeare in the Park into becoming one of New York City's most treasured and beloved traditions. The first production, in 1962, was The Merchant of Venice starring George C. Scott and James Earl Jones.Central Park Conservancy. Retrieved July 21, 2013. Notable recent productions include Amy Adams, Denis O'Hare and Donna Murphy in Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Into the Woods, Lily Rabe in As You Like It, Al Pacino in The Merchant of Venice, Anne Hathaway and Audra McDonald in Twelfth Night, and the 2008 revival of HAIR. The Public is known for casting both seasoned talent and for providing exposure for up and coming actors in Park productions, including Billy Crudup, Morgan Freeman, Marcia Gay Harden, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeff Goldblum, Liev Schreiber, Patrick Stewart, Christopher Walken and Denzel Washington, not to mention dozens of directors and designers. In 2010, Shakespeare in the Park featured repertory casting for the first time in decades. Two shows, The Merchant of Venice and The Winter's Tale, ran on an alternating basis over the course of the series and featured largely the same cast. The trend continued in the 2011 season. The 2011 season, featured All's Well That Ends Well, directed by Daniel Sullivan, and Measure for Measure, directed by David Esbjornson, running in repertory on alternate evenings.Healy, Patrick (March 28, 2011). \\"Repertory Casting Returns for Shakespeare in the Park\\".

As of 2016, only two of the structures, Crooked Creek (320 ¬± 80 Ma) and Decaturville (< 300 Ma), both in Missouri, are listed as confirmed impact craters in the Earth Impact Database. There is evidence that at least some of the features, such as Hicks Dome in Illinois, are volcanic in origin. These features are associated with faults and fractured rock, and are accompanied by igneous rocks and mineral deposits. Hicks Dome is a structural dome which has its central Devonian core displaced upward some in relation to the surrounding strata. The dome has small associated igneous dikes around its flanks.Raymond Wiggers, 1997, Geology underfoot in Illinois, Mountain Press, p. 252‚Äì256. Interest in the possibility of serial impacts on Earth was piqued by observations of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacting on Jupiter in 1994. It has been estimated, however, that the likelihood of such an event occurring on Earth is vanishingly small because the Earth's weaker gravitational field is much less able than Jupiter's to pull a speeding object close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces. However, evidence of serial impacts on the Moon, whose gravitational field is even weaker, can be seen in several chains of craters on the lunar surface.

The plot follows Dracula, who arrives in New Orleans, Louisiana in the 21st century and seeks out Mary Heller, a descendant of Abraham Van Helsing. Dracula 2000, the promotional title of which is Wes Craven Presents: Dracula 2000, builds upon Bram Stoker's original 1897 novel Dracula, with Count Dracula resurrected in contemporary America. The film was a critical and commercial disappointment, though two direct-to-video sequels, both written and directed by Lussier, were produced. Plot Matthew Van Helsing, the alleged descendant of the famed 19th century Dutch physician Abraham Van Helsing, owns an antique shop built over the site of Carfax Abbey in London in 2000. One night, with Van Helsing upstairs, his secretary, Solina, allows a group of thieves, led by her boyfriend, Marcus, into the shop. The thieves infiltrate the shop's underground high-security vault and find a sealed silver coffin protected by a deadly defense system. Based on the level of security surrounding the coffin, Solina and Marcus decide that the coffin's contents must be valuable, so they escape with it and flee to New Orleans. When Van Helsing discovers that the coffin has been stolen, he boards a plane to America, telling his apprentice, Simon Sheppard, to remain in London. Simon does not follow these instructions and follows his mentor. Aboard their plane, one of the thieves manages to open the coffin, revealing the dormant body of Count Dracula. Dracula awakens and attacks the thieves, in the process , biting Solina , causing the plane to crash in the Louisiana swamps. Dracula survives the crash , and bites news reporter Valerie Sharpe who is reporting the crash and travels to New Orleans, where college students Mary Heller and Lucy Westerman are living. Mary is estranged from her family and has recently been plagued by nightmares of a strange, terrifying man. Van Helsing and Simon arrive in New Orleans and destroy the newly turned vampires left in Dracula's wake, except Solina and Marcus. Afterwards, Van Helsing reveals to Simon that he is in fact the original Abraham Van Helsing, who defeated Dracula in 1897. Because he was unable to destroy Dracula permanently, Van Helsing hid the body and prolonged his own life with regular injections of Dracula's blood filtered via leeches until, one day, he could discover a way to kill Dracula for good. Simon is intrigued by Dracula's hatred of all things Christian and wonders why he is also particularly vulnerable to silver. Van Helsing also tells Simon about his daughter, Mary, who was taken from England by her mother after the truth about his identity came to light. Since Mary was conceived after Van Helsing began his injections, she shares blood and a telepathic link with Dracula, who senses her existence and is in New Orleans to find her. Van Helsing and Simon try to reach Mary before Dracula does, but fail to do so before Dracula turns Lucy into a vampire. Dracula and his three new brides, Solina, Lucy, and Valerie , corner Van Helsing and kill him. Simon and Mary escape, only to be captured by Dracula shortly thereafter. On a rooftop, Dracula transforms Mary and in the process reveals his secret: he is none other than the Apostle Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus for a bribe of thirty pieces of silver. As he went to hang himself, the rope snapped and as punishment he was cursed to live for two thousand years as a vampire. After finding out that Dracula is Judas, she understands why the legendary vampire is vulnerable to silver. Two of the brides appear with Simon, Valerie having been killed by Simon after he took a wooden stick and drove its sharp end through Valerie's heart and Dracula tells Mary to bite him. However, Mary takes the opportunity to save Simon's life by faking the bite instead. Then, together Mary and Simon kill the two remaining brides. Angered by this, Dracula tries to throw Mary from the rooftop. Mary wraps some cable from a large crucifix around Dracula's neck and they both fall from the roof. Dracula hangs as he attempted to do two thousand years before, but this time the rope does not break, and he burns in the first sunlight. Mary survives the fall and is cured of her vampirism by Dracula saying \\"I release you\\" before he dies. In the end, she doubts whether the sun has truly killed Dracula. She returns him to the vault beneath Carfax Abbey and vows to watch over his ashes should he ever rise again.

Natural Water Birth Water birth is labor and sometimes delivery that occurs in water, usually a birthing pool. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend birthing in water as the safety has not been determined. Proponents believe childbirth in water results in a more relaxed, less painful experience that promotes a midwife-led model of care. Critics argue that the safety of waterbirth has not been scientifically proven and that a wide range of adverse neonatal outcomes have been documented, including increased mother or child infections and the possibility of infant drowning. A 2018 Cochrane Review of water immersion in the first stages of labor found evidence of fewer epidurals and few adverse effects but insufficient information regarding giving birth in water. Benefits A moderate to weak level of evidence indicates that water immersion during the first stage of childbirth reduces the pain of labor. A 2018 Cochrane Review found that immersion at this stage reduces the use of epidural analgesia; however, there is no clear evidence on the benefits of immersion for the second stage of labor, namely delivery (sometimes called full water birth). There is no evidence of increased adverse effects for immersion during the first or second stages of labor. There is not strong evidence that a water birth reduces tearing or perineal trauma. Water birth may offer perineal support for a birthing mother, and some theorize that this may decrease the risk of tearing and reduce the use of episiotomy. A 2014 review reported that water immersion during the first stage of labor can reduce the length of that stage, labor pain, and the use of epidural or spinal analgesia. It is also associated with a lower rate of cesarean delivery and stress urinary incontinence symptoms 42 days after delivery. The review reported that immersion during labor did not appear to increase the rate of infections for the mother or the baby, and APGAR scores for the newborn infant were similar to those of conventional births. Risks and concerns The British Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives issued a joint statement in 2006 supporting water birth for healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies but does not recommend it in cases of complications. In a 2005 commentary, the Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released an analysis of the scientific literature regarding underwater births. The Committee noted several positive studies for underwater birth but went on to criticize them for lacking proper scientific controls, a significant number of infant deaths and diseases, and the general lack of information to support the use of water births. The paper concluded: The AAP received numerous letters in response to the statement, many claiming passionately that water birth had strong benefits and minimal risks for both parents and children and criticizing the AAP for failing to publish positive studies about the practice. Assessing the Apgar scores is a way to quickly check the health of a newborn baby at one and five minutes, and scores can range from 0 to 10. Apgar scores of 7 or higher are considered to be normal. In response, an author of the statement noted that the claims made were unsubstantiated and based purely on anecdotal evidence, with no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that would allow an evidence-based assessment of the safety and benefits of water births. The author concluded by urging for proponents to support such a trial so that the question could be answered. The editor of the journal Pediatrics, where the commentary was published, noted that no such trials had ever been submitted to the journal, which had a policy against publishing articles that are not based on scientific evidence. The reply concluded that \\"I have not received any science-based commentaries from the groups that you cite in your letter. We cannot publish every letter, based on opinions only, that we receive.\\"  Water births  Majority of hospitals do not accommodate water births because of the added risks involved. Although water births have been proven to lessen pain without the need for an epidural there are no medical proven reasons why an expecting mother would need a water birth. Furthermore, there is an added liability of hospital water birth because of the instability to see what complications could potentially be happening from underwater. Therefore, majority of water births are done at home. However, there are some hospitals that do still offer alternative birthing suites for families that want to do a water birth. These birthing suites offer many amenities to expecting mother such as a whirlpool sub and aromatherapy while getting the professional care inside a hospital. Birth pool A birth pool is a specially designed vessel containing water for women to immerse themselves in for pain relief during labor. Birth pools work on the same principle as a bathtub, but are distinct from them due to buoyancy and freedom of movement, factors deemed to be important in labor. A birth pool can either be permanently installed or portable. Getting into a pool of water for labor is often called water birth because some women choose to remain in the water for birth as well. Health policy in England stipulates women should be given the opportunity to labor in water through the publication of Intrapartum care guidelines issued in 2007 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives have jointly supported labor and birthing in water, and encourage hospitals to ensure birth pools are available to all women. = Characteristics = Before birth pools became readily available there are many stories of women laboring and birthing in re-purposed tub-like products including animal watering troughs. Ordinary bathtubs found in American and British homes are not adequate to provide enough room for women to comfortably move and try different positions in labour, such as squatting or kneeling, and are not deep enough to create buoyancy. In order to create the feeling of weightlessness through buoyancy the water needs to almost cover the women's breasts while she is sitting and should cover her belly while she is squatting, leaning over the side of the pool or kneeling upright in the pool sitting back on her heels. The original circular birth pool Dr Michel Odent, the originator of the concept of birthing pools, used at Pithiviers hospital (France) in the early 1980s was two meters in diameter and 60 centimeters deep, large enough to accommodate two people and make it difficult for interference during the birthing process. Modern birth pools are somewhat smaller, with a diameter between 110-150 centimeters and at least 50, preferably 56, cm of water. Factors to consider when choosing a birth pool are: * Size ‚Äì is it appropriate for you and the place you will give birth * Fill time and process ‚Äì how long will it take and what type of hose/spout is required * Safety ‚Äì how will you safely get in and out = Types available in the UK= Birth pools are generally categorised between two broad types: permanently installed or portable. Many hospitals in the United Kingdom now have a birth pool plumbed in, and portable birth pools can be purchased or hired for use at home or in hospital. *Permanently Installed Birth Pools: The National Health Service (NHS) purchases birth pools for hospital birth centres, delivery suites and community midwife teams throughout the country. *Portable Birth Pools: More often used for home births, portable birth pools can also be used within hospitals when a permanently installed birth pool is not available.

Dawson enlisted into the 5th Cameronians in November 1914, but transferred to the Royal Engineers in March 1915. VC action He was 23 years old, and a corporal in the 187th Company, Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place at the Battle of Loos, for which he was awarded the VC. On 13 October 1915 at Hohenzollern Redoubt, France, during a gas attack, when the trenches were full of men, Corporal Dawson exposed himself fearlessly to the enemy's fire to give directions to his sappers and to clear the infantry out of sections of the trench which were full of gas. Finding three leaking cylinders, he rolled them well away from the trench, again under heavy fire, and then fired rifle bullets into them to let the gas escape. His gallantry undoubtedly saved many men from being gassed. Later career He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in December 1916 and demobilised as a Major in 1919. After graduating from Glasgow University he was commissioned in the Army Education Corps in 1920, but transferred to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps in 1931. He later achieved the rank of colonel. By co-incidence his second cousin (their fathers were first cousins) James Dalgleish Pollock was also awarded the Victoria Cross in the same battle at the Hohenzolleren Redoubt. He too saved his colleagues from certain death by climbing out of the trench and bombing German infiltrators out of the British lines. Both boys were born in the small Scottish town of Tillicoultry, though James Dawson's family moved to the county town of Alloa when he was eight. Both were considered local heroes in 1915 and were feted in Alloa and Tillicoultry in separate civic receptions, allied to recruitment drives. His VC is held by the University of Glasgow where he earned his BSc and is displayed at the Hunterian Museum.University of Glasgow References *Monuments to Courage (David Harvey, 1999) *The Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997) *The Sapper VCs (Gerald Napier, 1998) *Scotland's Forgotten Valour (Graham Ross, 1995) *VCs of the First World War - The Western Front 1915 (Peter F.

He received the award for his actions during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin in September 1918, while serving with Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front during the First World War. After the war, Currey worked as a labourer and railway worker before entering the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Labor Party representative for the seat of Kogarah, which he held between 1941 and his death in 1948. Early life Born at Wallsend, New South Wales, on 19 September 1895 Currey was the son of a miner, William Robert Currey and Mary Ellen Lang. After attending Dudley and Plattsburg public schools, he was employed as a wireworker in Leichhardt. In October 1916, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, volunteering for service overseas during the First World War, having attempted unsuccessfully several times before, being rejected as under-aged. After being accepted, Currey was eventually sent to the Western Front in Europe, where he initially served the 4th Light Trench Mortar Battery, before being posted in July 1917 to the 53rd Battalion ‚Äì an infantry battalion that had been recruited primarily from New South Wales ‚Äì as a reinforcement. In late 1917, Currey fought with the battalion during the Battle of Polygon Wood.

On 1 September 1918 in the attack on P√©ronne, France, Currey, as a 22-year-old private in the 53rd Battalion, rushed forward under heavy machine-gun fire and captured single-handed a 77-mm field gun which had been holding up the advance, killing all the crew. Later, when the advance was checked by an enemy strong-point he crept round the flank and engaged the post with a Lewis gun, then rushed it, causing many casualties. Subsequently he volunteered to carry orders for withdrawal to an isolated company, bringing back valuable information, doing so under heavy fire and despite being gassed. The citation published in the London Gazette of 14 December 1918 concluded that his behaviour was a \\"striking example of coolness, determination and utter disregard of danger... and his gallant work contributed largely to the success of the operation.\\" The Australian official war historian, Charles Bean, described the final act of Currey's heroism thusly: \\"At 3 am when efforts to reach (a Lt Waite in an advanced position) having failed Private Currey volunteered to make his third attempt and going out far into the disputed front he stood up and called with all his lung power. \\"Waitsy! Get in.\\" The Germans turned on him every weapon they had; he was gassed and his respirator was shot through. But Waite had heard him and returned.\\" Later life Currey was discharged from the AIF in 1919, and took up employment as a storeman, working for the Railways Department in New South Wales, remaining in the role until 1941. On 10 April 1920, he married Emmie Davies at St Saviour's Anglican Church, in Punchbowl, and the couple later had two daughters together. Currey briefly returned to the military twice: in 1930‚Äì32 he served in the Militia in the 45th Battalion, and then during the Second World War he served in the Australian Instructional Corps as a sergeant in a training role between 1940 and 1941 before being discharged. In 1941, he ceased working for the Railways, and successfully stood for election as the Labor Party member for Kogarah in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. He was the only Victoria Cross recipient to sit in the New South Wales parliament and was re-elected twice: in 1944 and 1947. In late April 1948, while in parliament, he collapsed and three days later, on 30 April 1948, he died at Bexley, New South Wales, from coronary-vascular disease. His funeral was held at St Stephen's Presbyterian church in Macquarie Street, Sydney, after which he was cremated and his ashes were interred at Woronora Cemetery. Remembrances Currey's Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Australia. Following a public appeal in 1956 a plaque was erected in memory of Currey in the Speakers Square within the New South Wales Parliament complex. During renovations in the 1970s the plaque was put into storage for safekeeping and was only rediscovered and restored to its place in 2008. In 1976, the Jeffries and Currey Memorial Library was opened by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler, at Dudley Public School to honour two of the school's pupils who were decorated with the Victoria Cross during the First World War: Clarence Jeffries and William Currey. The pair are also commemorated by the Capt. Clarence Smith Jeffries (V.C.) and Pte. William Matthew Currey (V.C.)

The river was named in 1858, when James Hector, a member of the Palliser Expedition, reported being kicked by his packhorse while exploring the river. Hector named the river and the associated pass as a result of the incident. The Kicking Horse Pass, which connects through the Rockies to the valley of the Bow River, was the route through the mountains subsequently taken by the Canadian Pacific Railway when it was constructed during the 1880s. The railway's Big Hill and associated Spiral Tunnels are in the Kicking Horse valley and were necessitated by the steep rate of descent of the river and its valley. Kicking Horse Pedestrian Bridge in Golden is the longest authentic covered timber-frame bridge in Canada. Planned as a community project by the Timber Framers Guild, local volunteers were joined by carpenters and timber framers from Canada, the United States and Europe. The bridge structure is long, with a Burr arch structure. The bridge was completed in September 2001. The Trans-Canada Highway traverses the river at several points from Yoho National Park to Golden, British Columbia. The river is spanned by the new Park Bridge. Kicking Horse Mountain Resort, named for the river and pass, is located not in the Canadian Rockies but across the Rocky Mountain Trench in the Dogtooth Range of the Purcell Mountains, on the other side of the town of Golden. Course Wapta Falls on Kicking Horse River The Kicking Horse River begins at the outlet of small Wapta Lake and flows southwest. It receives the Yoho River upstream from Field. The river continues to flow southwest until after it drops over Wapta Falls, when it takes a near hairpin turn and flows northwest into the Columbia River in Golden. Waterfalls The river has three waterfalls along its stretch. The first is the Kicking Horse Cascade, a long talus cascade which occurs just below the first highway crossing of the river below Wapta Lake. The second is the Natural Bridge Falls near Field. The final and largest is Wapta Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in Canada in both volume and width. They are over wide. Natural history =History= Natural bridge across the Kicking Horse River The River‚Äôs unusual name stems from an incident near Wapta Falls in August 1858, Sir James Hector writes: \\"A little way above this fall one of our pack horses, to escape the fallen timber, plunged into the river, luckily where it formed an eddy, but the banks were so steep that we had great difficulty in getting him out. In attempting to recatch my own horse, which had strayed off while we were engaged with the one in the water, he kicked me in the chest, but I had luckily got close to him before he struck out, so that I did not get the full force of the blow. However, it knocked me down and rendered me senseless for some time. This was unfortunate, as we had seen no tracks of game in the neighbourhood, and were now without food; but I was so hurt that we could not proceed further that day at least.\\" - James Hector chronicles, 1858 =James Hector= As surgeon and geologist to the Palliser Expedition from 1857 to 1860, Hector explored the country from the Red River Colony (Winnipeg) to Vancouver Island. He made many important observations regarding the geology and ethnology of the Canadian West and the Rocky Mountains, discovering the Kicking Horse Pass and giving the Kicking Horse River its name. =2019 Derailment= On 4 February 2019, a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train with 112 cars and 3 locomotives derailed near the Big Hill of Kicking Horse Pass. The train landed in the river, and three crew members were killed. Recreation Several whitewater rafting companies, as well as kayakers and canoeists, use the river. The first company to raft the Kicking Horse river is named Kootenay River Runners. They continue to raft trips on the Kicking Horse daily, as well as two other nearby rivers. There are three main sections of the Kicking Horse River used for such recreation. The upper canyon (accessed via Beaverfoot Road off Highway 1 West) is a class 3-4 whitewater run suitable for canoes, kayaks and rafts. Prior to a landslide in the upper canyon, boats had to portage a one kilometre stretch of rapids in order to avoid getting caught on rocks. After the landslide, the river was narrowed, allowing boats to pass freely through the rapids. Nowadays, this stretch is named Portage/Shotgun, hence the previous need to portage the area. The middle canyon (accessed via Kicking Horse rest area) is a class 4-5, depending on water levels. This run is suitable only for experienced kayakers and rafters. Commercial rafting companies avoid this section, due to the risk involved. The lower canyon is another class 3-4 whitewater run that is run by commercial rafting companies at suitable water levels. Prior to the start of the 2016 rafting season, Canadian Pacific railway installed a gate, prohibiting road access to the lower-canyon. Because of this, many rafting companies have been forced to stop rafting this portion of the river, resulting in revenue and job loss. The Kicking Horse is home to many varieties of freshwater fish, making fishing a viable activity.

Biography Born in Leicester, he was 41 years old, and a temporary captain in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 30 November 1917 at Masni√®res and Les Rues Vertes, France: An attack by the enemy captured brigade headquarters and ammunition dump. Captain Gee, finding himself a prisoner, managed to escape and organised a party of the brigade staff with which he attacked the enemy, closely followed by two companies of infantry. He cleared the locality and established a defensive flank, then finding an enemy machine-gun still in action, with a revolver in each hand he went forward and captured the gun, killing eight of the crew. He was wounded, but would not have his wound dressed until the defence was organised. He later transferred to the Royal West Kent Regiment. Post war After the war, Gee went into politics. He first stood for Parliament as a National Democratic Party candidate in the 1918 General Election at Consett, where he finished second. He then stood for Parliament as a Conservative in the 1921 Woolwich East by-election against Ramsay MacDonald. A great deal of attention was given in the campaign to the contrast between Gee as a Victoria Cross holder and Macdonald as a pacifist who opposed the war. Gee won the seat which he held until the next general election the following year, when he lost to the Labour Party candidate. He was elected MP for Bosworth at the 1924 general election.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1969 pp 62 & 410 He became clearly disillusioned with Parliamentary life however because he was reported to have been absent from his political duties for over a year at the time of the by-election called in 1927 after his resignation, having emigrated to the backwoods of Western Australia with no intention of returning.The Times, 24 March 1927 p9 He died in Perth, Western Australia, aged 84. He was cremated at the Karrakatta Crematorium. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Fusiliers Museum in the Tower of London, England.

The label, established by Clive Selwood and John Peel in 1986, was the primary distributor of BBC recordings, including Peel Sessions.Larkin, Colin (ed.) (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave, Virgin Books, The name came from the song written by Abel Meeropol and famously performed by Billie Holiday, itself a reference to racially motivated lynchings. The label had the aim of generating sufficient revenue from recordings of 'big name' artists to allow the release of recordings by lesser-known artists. The label's first release was New Order's 1982 Peel Session, in July 1987, and was followed by sessions from some of the biggest names from the punk rock and post punk eras. Recordings from as far back as the 1960s were also released by the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. As well as individual sessions, the label also released albums compiling several sessions by the same artist. Strange Fruit was sufficiently successful that it spawned subsidiary labels including Nighttracks (sessions from radio One's Evening Show), Raw Fruit Records (concert recordings from the Reading Festival), and Band of Joy (BBC session recordings from the 1960s and 1970s). In 1994, Peel's BBC colleague Andy Kershaw started another subsidiary label, Strange Roots, which released session recordings by world music and roots artists from his radio show. Strange Fruit closed in 2004. It was part of the Zomba Group of companies and was shut down when the label merged with BMG.

He won the VC on 3 July 1879 at Ulundi in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War when he was 28 years old, and a captain in the Frontier Light Horse. Early life D'Arcy was born in Wanganui, New Zealand, where his father Major Oliver Barker D'Arcy (sometimes D'Arcey) of the 65th Regiment was in the British garrison. In 1860, Oliver D'Arcy transferred to the Cape Mounted Riflemen and settled with his family at King William's Town in the Cape Colony. Anglo-Zulu War Redvers Buller's VC action, painted by H. Montagu Love (1905) During the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, Cecil D'Arcy was an officer in the Frontier Light Horse, a mounted unit of 200 volunteers raised at King William's Town in 1877 by Lieutenant Frederick Carrington. At the Battle of Hlobane on 28 March 1879, his unit acted as the rearguard and 20% of the 156 members were killed. D'Arcy was recommended for the VC by Evelyn Wood for going back to save the lives of wounded men in the descent of Devil's Pass; the award was not approved on the grounds that he was a volunteer and not a member of the imperial forces. Five other awards were approved, including to Colonel Redvers Buller; he had rescued D'Arcy who was retiring on foot and carrying him on his horse, while hotly pursued by Zulus. At the Battle of Kambula on the following day, the Frontier Light Horse were part of the pursuit of the retreating Zulu forces. Captain D'Arcy wrote in a letter published in The Natal Mercury in April that they \\"followed them for eight miles, butchering the brutes all over the place. I told the men, 'No quarter, boys, and remember yesterday'. And they did knock them about, killing them all over the place.\\" The FLH men extracted a savage revenge for their comrades killed the day before at Hlobane. He was awarded the VC for his actions on 3 July 1879 when a mounted reconnaissance was ambushed near Ulundi. In a dispatch dated 5 July in The London Gazette, Redvers Buller wrote that D'Arcy \\"reckons neither personal inconvenience nor danger in the execution of any order, determined and bold; he has frequently shown great personal gallantry, and has always given a fine example to his men.\\" The citation of the VC award reads; He was presented with his medal in December 1879 by Sir Garnet Wolseley in Pretoria. Further information After the Frontier Light Horse was disbanded, D'Arcy joined the Cape Mounted Riflemen as a captain. He served in the 1880 Basuto Gun War but resigned his commission in April 1881. In ill health, he stayed with Rev. Charles Taberer in Keiskammahoek to recuperate. During the night of 6‚Äì7 August 1881 he left the house; his body was not found for several months. He was interred on 3 January 1882 in the cemetery of King William's Town beside his parents. He is also considered South African, though he probably considered himself British or Anglo-Irish. Speculation In 2008, David Randall in The Independent newspaper in London reported claims that D'Arcy faked his death.

Cube with a simple lightmap (shown on the right). A lightmap is a data structure used in lightmapping, a form of surface caching in which the brightness of surfaces in a virtual scene is pre-calculated and stored in texture maps for later use. Lightmaps are most commonly applied to static objects in applications that use real-time 3D computer graphics, such as video games, in order to provide lighting effects such as global illumination at a relatively low computational cost. History John Carmack's Quake was the first computer game to use lightmaps to augment rendering. Before lightmaps were invented, realtime applications relied purely on Gouraud shading to interpolate vertex lighting for surfaces. This only allowed low frequency lighting information, and could create clipping artifacts close to the camera without perspective-correct interpolation. Discontinuity meshing was sometimes used especially with radiosity solutions to adaptively improve the resolution of vertex lighting information, however the additional cost in primitive setup for realtime rasterization was generally prohibitive. Quake's software rasterizer used surface caching to apply lighting calculations in texture space once when polygons initially appear within the viewing frustum (effectively creating temporary 'lit' versions of the currently visible textures as the viewer negotiated the scene). As consumer 3d graphics hardware capable of multitexturing, light-mapping became more popular, and engines began to combine light-maps in real time as a secondary multiply-blend texture layer. Limitations Lightmaps are composed of lumels (Lumination elements), analogous to texels in Texture Mapping. Smaller lumels yield a higher resolution lightmap, providing finer lighting detail at the price of reduced performance and increased memory usage. For example, a lightmap scale of 4 lumels per world unit would give a lower quality than a scale of 16 lumels per world unit. Thus, in using the technique, level designers and 3d artists often have to make a compromise between performance and quality; if high resolution lightmaps are used too frequently then the application may consume excessive system resources, negatively affecting performance. Lightmap resolution and scaling may also be limited by the amount of disk storage space, bandwidth/download time, or texture memory available to the application. Some implementations attempt to pack multiple lightmaps together in a process known as atlasing to help circumvent these limitations. Lightmap resolution and scale are two different things. The resolution is the area, in pixels, available for storing one or more surface's lightmaps. The number of individual surfaces that can fit on a lightmap is determined by the scale. Lower scale values mean higher quality and more space taken on a lightmap. Higher scale values mean lower quality and less space taken. A surface can have a lightmap that has the same area, so a 1:1 ratio, or smaller, so the lightmap is stretched to fit. Lightmaps in games are usually colored texture maps, or per vertex colors. They are usually flat, without information about the light's direction, whilst some game engines use multiple lightmaps to provide approximate directional information to combine with normal-maps. Lightmaps may also store separate precalculated components of lighting information for semi-dynamic lighting with shaders, such as ambient-occlusion & sunlight shadowing. Creation When creating lightmaps, any lighting model may be used, because the lighting is entirely precomputed and real-time performance is not always a necessity. A variety of techniques including ambient occlusion, direct lighting with sampled shadow edges, and full radiosityJason Mitchell, Gary McTaggart, Chris Green, Shading in Valve's Source Engine. (PDF) Retrieved Jun. 07, 2019. bounce light solutions are typically used. Modern 3D packages include specific plugins for applying light-map UV-coordinates, atlas-ing multiple surfaces into single texture sheets, and rendering the maps themselves. Alternatively game engine pipelines may include custom lightmap creation tools. An additional consideration is the use of compressed DXT textures which are subject to blocking artifacts ‚Äì individual surfaces must not collide on 4x4 texel chunks for best results. In all cases, soft shadows for static geometry are possible if simple occlusion tests (such as basic ray-tracing) are used to determine which lumels are visible to the light. However, the actual softness of the shadows is determined by how the engine interpolates the lumel data across a surface, and can result in a pixelated look if the lumels are too large. See texture filtering. Lightmaps can also be calculated in real-timeNovember 16, 2003. Dynamic Lightmaps in OpenGL. Joshbeam.com Retrieved Jul. 07, 2014. for good quality colored lighting effects that are not prone to the defects of Gouraud shading, although shadow creation must still be done using another method such as stencil shadow volumes or shadow mapping, as real-time ray-tracing is still too slow to perform on modern hardware in most 3D engines. Photon mapping can be used to calculate global illumination for light maps. Alternatives =Vertex lighting= In vertex lighting, lighting information is computed per vertex and stored in vertex color attributes. The two techniques may be combined, e.g. vertex color values stored for high detail meshes, whilst light maps are only used for coarser geometry. =Discontinuity mapping= In discontinuity mapping, the scene may be further subdivided and clipped along major changes in light and dark to better define shadows.

He was one of 64 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the First World War, performing the deeds that led to his award in September 1918 during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin while serving with Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front. After the war, Cartwright returned to Australia and worked as a mechanic. He continued to serve in the military part-time, returning to full-time service during the Second World War, undertaking a training role in Australia. He was demobilised in 1946, and returned to civilian life. He died at the age of 83. Early life Cartwright was born in South Kensington, London, on 9 December 1894 to William Edward Cartwright, a coach trimmer, and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Stracey). He attended the local school, before emigrating to Australia in 1912 at the age of eighteen without his family. Settling in New South Wales, Cartwright gained employment at a sheep station in the Elsmore district as a labourer. First World War On 9 December 1915‚Äîhis 21st birthday‚ÄîCartwright enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War. Allotted to the newly raised 33rd Battalion‚Äîan infantry battalion raised in New South Wales‚Äîas a private, he embarked aboard HMAT Marathon at Sydney on 4 May 1916. Disembarking at Devonport, England, two months later, the members of the 33rd Battalion spent the following four months training at Larkhill Camp on Salisbury Plain. After the 3rd Division, to which the 33rd Battalion was assigned, deployed to the Western Front in November 1916, Cartwright served with them through the Battle of Messines where he was wounded in June 1917. Later, in April 1918, he was wounded again when the 33rd Battalion's position was attacked with gas while holding a position around Villers-Bretonneux. He was briefly hospitalised but returned to duty in June. In August, the Allies launched the Hundred Days Offensive around Amiens, which resulted in a series of advances as the Allies sought to break through the Hindenburg Line. On 31 August 1918, at Road Wood, south-west of Bouchavesnes, near Peronne, France, when two companies became held up by machine gun fire, Cartwright attacked the gun alone under intense fire. He shot three of the crew, and, having bombed the post, captured the gun and nine enemy soldiers. For his actions he was recommended for the Victoria Cross. On 30 September 1918 he was wounded and evacuated to England. Cartwright was conferred with his VC by King George V, and at the end of the war Cartwright was repatriated to Australia, arriving in March 1919 and as the AIF was demobilised, he was discharged on 16 May 1919. For his war service he received the following medals: the Victoria Cross, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Inter-war years and Second World War During the inter- war years, Cartwright moved to Sydney, where he found work as a motor mechanic. He married Elsie Broker at St Stephen's Anglican Church, at Chatswood, New South Wales, on 25 June 1921. They later had two children, but the marriage ended in divorce. He remained in the military, serving part-time in the Militia, posted to the 4th/3rd Battalion, eventually being commissioned as an officer on 25 February 1932. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Cartwright was mobilised for war service on 5 March 1940, serving in a training role in Australia. He was promoted to captain in 1942, and served throughout the war. In addition to the decorations he received for his previous service, Cartwright also later received the Efficiency Decoration and the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945. Later life After the war, Cartwright was demobilised in May 1946. He later worked as an assistant-cashier and in 1948 remarried, exchanging nuptials with Evelyn Mary Short on 4 September 1948 in the Congregational Church, at Pitt Street in Sydney. During his later life, he attended several functions held in London for Victoria Cross and George Cross recipients. He died at the age of 84 on 2 February 1978, at Gordon, New South Wales; his wife and one of his children survived him. He was cremated and his Victoria Cross and other decorations were later donated by his widow to the Imperial War Museum in London, where they are currently held. Cartwright is commemorated in the New South Wales Garden of Remembrance, at Rookwood, and also at the Kurrajong Memorial in Inverell, New South Wales, which was unveiled in 2005 in honour of the 114 men from the town who enlisted in January 1916.

Rapidly rising in the navy due to keen intelligence and impressive strength, Ritchie was promoted to lieutenant six years later, and served for the next fifteen years as a junior staff officer at Sheerness Gunnery School. In 1900 Ritchie became the armed forces lightweight boxing champion, and was the runner-up in the same contest the following year.P.6, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling In July 1902 he was posted to the battleship HMS Sans Pareil, docked in the Medway as part of the Reserve squadron. Whilst stationed at Sheerness, he met and married Christiana Lilian Jardine, with whom he had two daughters. His shore service ended in March 1911, when he was posted as senior lieutenant to the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Goliath. Promoted to commander later that year, he managed the ship's gunnery exercises and procedures while Goliath was part of the Channel Fleet stationed in British waters. It was said by one of his junior officers that \\"Ritchie had the reputation of being very strict, but I always found him most fair\\".P.7, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling War service At the outbreak of World War I, Goliath was ordered to the Indian Ocean to lead a blockade of the German colony of German East Africa, and specifically its main port at Dar-es-Salaam. It was feared by the Admiralty that the German navy would use its colonial ports to support commerce raiding cruisers such as the SMS Emden or the SMS Konigsberg, both of which were known to be operating in the Indian Ocean at that time.P.1, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling This concern was amplified because the Konigsberg, blockaded in the delta of the Rufiji River, had operated from Dar-es-Salaam in the early months of the war and had sunk the British cruiser HMS Pegasus on a raid from the port. Remaining in Dar-es-Salaam's large natural harbour were the German cargo ships SS Konig and SS Feldmarschall, the hospital ship SS Tabora and several smaller coastal vessels - all of which could conceivably be used to resupply the trapped cruiser should they leave port. Despite a declaration from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee that neither the harbour nor its ships would be used for military purposes, the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping in the port must nevertheless be neutralised.P.2, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling The Germans had pre-emptively scuttled a blockship in the port's entrance channel, with the intention of preventing Goliath and the other heavy British warships from entering the harbour to shell the undefended city. With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers from the small blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in the port, thus denying its use to the Germans as well. Command of the assault was given to Commander Ritchie as the second most senior officer present, and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats, Dupleix and Helmuth, to carry his raiding parties. =Raid on Dar- es-Salaam= Kaiserstrasse in 1905. This was the main street of the city, and was very badly damaged by naval bombardment during and after the raid. The day prior to the raid the decision was taken that, in order to allow the Germans time to evacuate the target ships and minimise casualties, they would be warned of the British intentions. In a brief parley the German defenders requested that the British conduct their operations under a white flag, which request was denied. Ritchie was informed that he could begin his assault on the following morning of 28 November 1914. Due to a breakdown aboard the Dupleix before it reached the harbour, Ritchie had to begin his assault with only the Helmuth and a handful of small boats and launches from the blockading ships. There were no signs of life on the target ships as Ritchie's flotilla moved uncontested into the port, and the shoreline was described by officers in the raiding party as \\"utterly deserted\\" and \\"cool and inviting\\". Shortly after 10:00 the raiders laid explosive charges on the abandoned Konig and Feldmarschall. However they were then challenged by the port's commanding officer, who questioned their right to be in the anchorage and demanded to be permitted to observe their actions in order that he could make a report. In a meeting aboard the Helmuth it was explained to him that British orders were to disable German assets in the harbour and that, being at war, his permission was unnecessary. After some discussion he was persuaded to disembark so that the Helmuth could continue operations.P.3, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took the Helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, he returned to the two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery of a large number of empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour. Despite this discovery Ritchie resolved to continue as ordered. He took the precaution of sending Helmuth to the harbour entrance to cover the withdrawal, and gathered together several small boats moored in the harbour. These he secured around his launch, providing added buoyancy in case it received fatal damage in the engagement he was sure would ensue.first-world-war.com, How Commander Henry Peel Ritchie Won The V.C. At Dar-es-Salaam, Retrieved on 27 May 2007 With preparations complete, one of Ritchie's boats (from the cruiser HMS Fox) moved to the harbour entrance. There it was met with a hail of fire from the shore, where the hidden German crews and town garrison had lain in wait. The Helmuth was also attacked, but despite sustaining severe damage both craft were able to limp to safety, carrying several wounded. From outside the harbour Fox and Goliath responded with a heavy barrage, demolishing several streets in the town, including the Governor's Palace. Ritchie, aboard the only remaining British boat in the harbour, attempted to pick up one of his officers who had earlier gone aboard the German hospital ship SS Tabora to conduct a medical inspection.P.4, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling This effort was unsuccessful, and on leaving the harbour Ritchie's launch came under sustained fire from machine guns, rifles and light artillery. With most of his crew wounded, Ritchie refused to relinquish his place at the helm until he had steered his boat to safety. He was discovered \\"simply smothered in blood and barely conscious\\" by Goliath's crew when they went to his aid in the battleship's pinnace. Ritchie was rushed to the sick bay, where it was ascertained that he had been hit in eight separate places.P.5, The Naval VCs, Stephen Snelling The raid had cost the British one dead, fourteen seriously wounded and twelve captured after they were left behind in the confusion. The raiders had in turn immobilised three large merchant vessels and destroyed several shore installations, as well as taking thirty five prisoners. Two days later, with the wounded hospitalised in Zanzibar, Goliath and Fox returned to Dar-es- Salaam and reduced most of the seafront to rubble, setting fire to several other districts of the town as well. This reprisal served only to turn the hitherto neutral local populace against the British. Feelings ran high in both camps following the raid, with the British claiming that white flags flying from several shore installations should have prevented any German attack, and the Germans insisting that the British had attempted to capture their merchant vessels' crews despite promises not to do so. According to Stephen Snelling in The Naval VCs, both sides had entered the operation with the intention of breaching the predetermined agreements. Retirement and the Victoria Cross Ten were honoured for their role in the operation, seven receiving Distinguished Service Medals, two the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and one, the grievously wounded Ritchie, the Victoria Cross. Ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty's change of heart was possibly a morale-boosting measure, although Ritchie's courage during the action was never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries to his forehead, left thumb, left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large-calibre machine gun bullets. Ritchie spent six weeks in hospital in Zanzibar before he was considered well enough to be transported home. In England he recovered during the spring of 1915 at Plymouth Hospital, with his family present. Although judged fit in late February, Ritchie was assigned light duties and was not returned to Goliath; a disappointment which proved fortunate for him when she was sunk off the Dardanelles in May 1915 by the Turkish destroyer Muavenet with the loss of five hundred lives. His Victoria Cross was presented by King George V at Buckingham Palace in April 1915. Promoted acting captain, he retired in 1917 having been deemed unfit for further service as a legacy of the wounds he had received. Following his retirement Ritchie settled with his family back in his home city of Edinburgh, and lived a quiet and uneventful retirement. He was not involved in any official capacity during the Second World War, and died at his home in 1958. Ritchie was cremated at Warriston.Grave location for holders of the Victoria Cross in the city of Edinburgh , Retrieved on 27 May 2007 There are no memorials or headstones dedicated to him today, and his Victoria Cross is not on public display.

Timocreon, also from Ialysos, composed songs for drinking parties and was himself an athlete Timocreon of Ialysus in Rhodes (, gen.: Œ§ŒπŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ≠ŒøŒΩœÑŒøœÇ) was a Greek lyric poet who flourished about 480 BC, at the time of the Persian Wars. His poetry survives only in a very few fragments, and some claim he has received less attention from modern scholars than he deserves.Rachel M. McMullin, 'Aspects of Medizing: Themistocles, Simonides and Timocreon of Rhodes', The Classical Journal Vol. 97, No. 1 (October -November 2001), page online here He seems to have composed convivial verses for drinking parties. However he is remembered particularly for his bitter clashes with Themistocles and Simonides over the issue of his medizing (siding with the Persian invaders), for which he had been banished from his home around the time of the Greek victory at the Battle of Salamis. He was also an athlete of some distinction and reputedly a glutton.David A. Campbell, Greek Lyric IV, Loeb Classical Library (1992), page 4 An epitaph for him, appearing in the Palatine Anthology, was credited to his rival, Simonides: \\"After much drinking, much eating and much slandering, I, Timocreon of Rhodes, rest here.\\"David A. Campbell, Greek Lyric III, Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 555 Life and poetry Plutarch is the main source of information about Timocreon's role as a medizer and enemy of Themistocles (Themistocles 21), while Herodotus supplies much of the background information (Histories 8.111-12). According to these accounts, Themistocles, the hero of the Battle of Salamis, gave up the pursuit of the retreating Persians to extort money from Greek island states in the Aegean, without the knowledge of his fellow commanders. It is possible that Timocreon was on Andros at this timeRuth Scodel, 'Timocreon's Encomium of Aristides', Classical Antiquity Vol. 2, No. 1 (April 1983), page 102, notes section] and he paid Themistocles three talents of silver to restore him to his home town in Rhodes, from which he had been exiled for medizing. Themistocles took the money but reneged on the agreement and, even though bonds of hospitality between them required good faith, he accepted a bribe from someone else in a new deal that excluded Timocreon. Sailing away with the poet's money in his coffers but minus the poet himself, Themistocles soon arrived at the Corinthian Isthmus, where the Greek commanders met to decide who most deserved the prize for valour in their recent victory at Salamis. Themistocles hosted a banquet in an attempt to curry favour with his colleagues but won nothing by it since each of the commanders subsequently voted himself the most deserving of the prize (Histories 8.123-4). These events are commemorated by Timocreon in Fragment 727 (see below), composed in 480 BC or just a few years after the Battle of Salamis, though some scholars date it after Themistocles' fall from grace in Athens in 471 BC.Ruth Scodel, 'Timocreon's Encomium of Aristides', Classical Antiquity Vol. 2, No. 1 (April 1983), page 102, notes section] In an account recorded by Athenaeus, Timocreon ended up at the court of the Persian king where he distinguished himself as an athlete and glutton, eating so much that the king himself asked him what he was trying to do, to which Timocreon replied that he was getting ready to beat up countless Persians. He made good his promise the next day and, after overwhelming all the Persians who were game enough to fight him, he commenced punching the air, just to show that \\"he had all those blows left if anyone wanted to take him on.\\" Athenaeus 10.415f-416a, cited and translated by David Campbell, Greek Lyric IV, Loeb Classical Library (1992), page 87 However, the boorishness and gluttony of athletes was a topos of Greek comedy and even a hero like Hercules was the butt of many jokes. In some accounts, Themistocles also ended up visiting the Persian king, following his ostracism and spectacular fall from public favour in Athens. Rumours that he was medizing offered Timocreon a chance for revengesee Fragment 728 and Fragment 729. Timocreon was also known as a composer of scolia (drinking-songs) and, according to the Suda, wrote plays in the style of Old Comedy. A famous drinking song of his was about the god Plutus, which seems to have inspired imitation by Aristophanessee Fragment 731. Nothing however is known of his comedies and it is probable that he was not a dramatist but simply composed mocking lyrics. In an account by Philodemus (On Vices 10.4), he is presented as a conceited singer at a festival competition, where he performed a song about Castor.David Campbell, Greek Lyric IV, Loeb Classical Library (1992), page 85, notes Diogenian mentions two proverbs that Timocreon employed in his verses. One was a Cyprian fable about doves escaping from a sacrificial fire only to fall into another fire later on (demonstrating that wrong-doers eventually get their just deserts), and the other was a Carian fable about a fisherman who espies an octopus in the winter sea and wonders whether or not to dive after it, since this is a choice between his children starving or himself freezing to death (i.e. you're damned if you do and damned if you don't).'Diogenian', preface to Proverbs, cited by David Campbell's translation, Greek Lyric IV, Loeb Classical Library (1992), pages 93, 97 The latter proverb was also used by Simonides,Simonides frag. 514, cited by David Campbell, Greek Lyric III, Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 380 whose rivalry with Timocreon seems to have inspired the abusive 'epitaph' quoted earlier and the epigrammatic reply from the Rhodian poet in A.P. 13.31. =Fragment 727 PMG= This is the largest extant poem attributed to Timocreon. It was quoted by Plutarch in a biography of Themistocles, as were the following two fragments, 728 and 729 (see Life above for historical context). It begins like a hymn of praise or encomium for the Athenian hero, Aristides, but soon turns into a denunciation of Themistocles. { style=\\"border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space:nowrap;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"400px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"400px\\"  - border=\\"0\\" - Valign=top   Well now, if you praise Pausanias and you, sir, Xanthippus, and you Leotychides, I commend Aristides as the very best man to have come from holy Athens, for Themistocles was hated by Leto as a liar, a criminal, a traitor, bribed with baneful silver not to take Timocreon home to his native Ialysus though he was his guest and friend, but instead took his three talents of silver and sailed to perdition, restoring some to their homes unjustly, chasing out others, killing some. Gorged with silver, he made an absurd Isthmian innkeeper, serving cold meat: the guests ate up and prayed that Themistocles would go unnoticed.adaptation of David Campbell's translation, Greek Lyric IV, Loeb Classical Library (1992), pages 89, 91 } The poem is generally more valued by historians than by literary criticsit has been thought to lack elegance and wit, and it strangely includes elements of choral lyric though it is not a choral song but a solo performance.

It has been ranked as the \\"most successful slave revolt in US history\\". Two persons died as a result of the revolt, a black slave and a white slave trader. The United Kingdom had abolished the slave trade for British vessels in 1807, and slavery in its colonies effective 1834. Accordingly, its officials in the Bahamas ruled that most of the slaves on the Creole were freed after arrival there, if they chose to stay. Officials detained the 19 men who rebelled on ship until the Admiralty Court of Nassau held a special session in April 1842 to consider charges of piracy against them. The Court ruled that the men had been illegally held in slavery and had the right to use force to gain freedom; they were not seeking private gain. The 17 survivors (two had died in the interim), were released. When the Creole reached New Orleans in December 1841 with three women and two child slaves aboard (who had made the mistake of remaining in hiding), Southerners were outraged about the loss of property. Relations between the United States and Britain were strained for a time. The incident occurred during negotiations for the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 but was not directly addressed. The parties settled on seven crimes qualifying for extradition in the treaty; they did not include slave revolts. Eventually claims for losses of slaves from Creole and two other US ships were covered, along with other claims dating to 1814, in a treaty of 1853 between the US and Britain, for which an arbitration commission awarded settlements in 1855 against each nation. The revolt In the fall of 1841, the brig Creole, owned by Johnson and Eperson of Richmond, Virginia, was transporting 135 African-American slaves for sale in New Orleans, the South's major market. It had left Richmond with 103 slaves and picked up another 32 at Hampton Roads, Virginia. Most were owned by Johnson and Eperson, and 26 were owned by Thomas McCargo, a slave trader who was one of the passengers on board. While the United States had prohibited the international slave trade effective in 1808, it permitted the domestic slave trade among those states that authorized slavery; many slave traders transported African-American captives by the coastwise slave trade along the East Coast. The brig also carried tobacco, a crew of 10, the captain's wife, daughter and niece; four passengers, including slave traders; and eight enslaved black servants, for a total of 160 on board.Jervey, Edward D. and Huber, C. Harold. \\"The Creole Affair\\", The Journal of Negro History, Vol. 65, No. 3 (Summer 1980), pp. 196‚Äì211, accessed 8 April 2013 Madison Washington, a refugee slave who had been recaptured after returning from Canada to Virginia for his wife, was among those being shipped for sale in New Orleans.R. Edward Lee, \\"Madison Washington, Slave Mutineer,\\" Blacfax, Winter/Spring 1998, Vol. 8 Issue 36, p. 8 The slaves were kept in the forward hold, and he gained the deck after one of the crew had lifted the grate. On November 7, 1841, Washington and eighteen other male slaves rebelled; they overwhelmed the crew and killed John R. Hewell, one of the slave traders, with a knife. The crew and passengers had only one gun among them, which they never used. The captain, who was wounded, and two mates had gone up into the rigging to escape the fighting. One of the slaves was badly wounded and later died. Some other members of the crew were wounded but all survived. The slaves took overseer William Merritt at his word that he would navigate for them. They first demanded that the ship be taken to Liberia, which the US had established as a free colony in West Africa. Merritt said that voyage was impossible as they did not have enough food or water. Another slave leader, Ben Blacksmith, said they should be taken to the British West Indies, as he knew the slaves from the Hermosa had gained freedom there the previous year. British actions in Nassau On November 9, 1841, the Creole reached Nassau, where it was first boarded by the harbor pilot and his crew, all local black Bahamians.The Times, January 21, 1842, p. 3 They told the American slaves that, under Bahamian colonial law, they were free. The crew advised them to go ashore at once. The Quarantine Officer came aboard. As the captain Robert Ensor was badly wounded, the officer took First Mate Zephaniah Gifford to inform the American Consul of the events. At the Consul's request, the governor of the Bahamas ordered a guard to board the Creole to prevent the escape of the men implicated in Hewell's death. The 24 black soldiers were led by a white officer. This action prevented the slaves from dispersing into the city. Fearing the British would apply their ban on slavery to the American slaves, the American consul tried to organize American sailors on the island to take back control of the ship. He intended to have them sail the ship out of British jurisdiction with the slaves still aboard. An American group of sailors approached the ship on November 12, intending to sail it away, but were foiled by a Bahamian who shouted a warning to the officer of the guard aboard the Creole. He threatened to fire into the Americans in their boat, and they withdrew. After an investigation by magistrates, on Friday, 13 November 1841, the Bahamian Attorney-General went aboard. He told the nineteen rebels that they would be detained. He informed the remainder: \\"You are free, and at liberty to go onshore, and wherever you please.\\" A fleet of small boats manned by locals, who until then had surrounded the brig at a distance, immediately came forward. The Attorney-General warned the people against boarding the Creole, but said they could provide passage to those slaves who wished to go to shore. Most did so, although three women, a girl, and a boy stayed in hiding on board. They eventually sailed with the ship to New Orleans and back to slavery. The New Providence government arranged for a ship bound for Jamaica, also under British control, to take passengers to that island for free, and announced it in the newspaper. Numerous American blacks from the Creole left for Jamaica aboard it. After the Bahamian government arrested the conspirators, the United States government dropped its claims for all the slaves to be returned to its custody. There was no extradition treaty at the time between Britain and the United States governing such circumstances. The British authorities determined that the slaves had not committed any breach of British or maritime law. As under British law they were free men, they were considered to have the right to use force to escape the detention of illegal slavery.The Times, February 16, 1842, p. 13: Quote: \\"In answer to an inquiry of Lord BROUGHAM, Lord ABERDEEN stated that orders had been sent out to the Governor of the Bahamas to liberate the 19 slaves now under constraint at Nassau for the mutiny and murder on board that vessel, unless (which is not to be apprehended) there were any local laws which justified or demanded a contrary course.\\" The Admiralty Court in Nassau held a special session in April to consider a charge of piracy against the men implicated in the mutiny. Ruling that their action was not piracy, the Court ordered the surviving 17 mutineers to be released on April 16, 1842.The Times, May 18, 1842, p. 3 As a total of 128 slaves gained their freedom, this has been described as the \\"most successful slave revolt in US history\\". The Creole had departed months before for the United States, reaching its original destination of New Orleans on December 2, 1841. Five slaves were still aboard, outraging planters and politicians who learned that the remaining slaves had been freed by British authorities. The case attracted national attention in the United States and provoked diplomatic controversy. In Boston in 1842, abolitionist William E. Channing published a pamphlet, \\"The Duty of the Free States or Remarks Suggested by the Case of the 'Creole',\\" to refute claims by Southern politicians that the human property of U.S. slave owners should be protected in foreign ports.\\"Slaves Commandeer the Creole\\", Slavery: Flights to Freedom, African-American Odyssey: February 5 through May 2, 1998; Library of Congress, accessed <14 February 2014 The issue was also under discussion due to negotiations over the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, which was ratified with the United Kingdom that year. Less than a year later, the Creole was wrecked in a violent storm while in harbor at Funchal, Madeira.The Times, November 22, 1842, p. 4 Political consequences The Creole case generated diplomatic tension between the United Kingdom and the United States, and political rumblings within the United States. Southerners were outraged to have lost property in another instance of British colonists freeing slaves from American ships that had gone into their ports in the Caribbean. The John Tyler administration supported Southerners in seeking the return of the slaves. Although known as an abolitionist , Daniel Webster as Secretary of State served John Tyler; he stated the US position to the United Kingdom that the slaves were legal property of US citizens and demanded their return. The United Kingdom had abolished slavery effective August 1834, and it rejected the U.S. claim. It had advised all nations that under its law, ships that went into its colonial ports would forfeit any slaves on board. It said that Nassau was a British territory where British law must be applied. Under it, the 'slaves' aboard the Creole were to be considered free passengers. Accordingly, unless they could be proved to have broken local or maritime law, it would be false imprisonment to detain them against their will. The abolitionist Charles Sumner argued that the slaves \\"became free men when taken, by the voluntary action of their owners, beyond the jurisdiction of the slave states.\\" In March 1842 US Representative Joshua Reed Giddings of Ohio introduced a series of nine resolutions on this topic, arguing against the federal government acting on behalf of the slaveholders. He argued that Virginia state law did not apply to slaves who were outside Virginian waters, the federal government had no part in it, and the coastwise slave trade was unconstitutional, as slaves were beyond state law on the high seas, and thus free. Southerners in the House of Representatives disagreed with his position. The members censured Giddings by a large margin for violating an informal gag rule that had been in effect since 1836, barring discussion of slavery in the House. He promptly resigned. When the Ohio legislature held a special election in May 1842 for his seat, the voters of Ohio overwhelmingly reelected Giddings,Andrew Glass, \\"Ohio Whig Joshua Giddings resigns, March 22, 1842\\", Politico.com, 22 March 2012, accessed 31 March 2013 by 7,469 to 383.Gerald Horne, Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation, New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, p. 137 Encouraged by the outcome of the Creole revolt, abolitionists renewed their political attacks on slavery and the coastwise trade. In the newspaper article, \\"The Hero Mutineers,\\" Madison Washington was named the 'romantic hero.'\\"The Hero Mutineers,\\" The New York Evangelist, 1842 Washington was said to have shown sympathy toward the white crew members on the Creole by preventing his fellow slave mates from murdering all of them when they made a last effort to regain control. He was said to have personally dressed sailors' wounds after the revolt. The case roused strong feelings on both sides of the Atlantic, as the events occurred during the negotiations related to the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 between the two nations, primarily to settle the borders between the US and Canada, a British colony. According to the New York Courier and Inquirer, Daniel Webster, as Secretary of State, wrote to Lord Ashburton, then in Washington, DC: > The Creole case is presented in strong terms by Mr Webster in a letter > (which, when published, will bring all the anti-slavery people about his > ears)...\\" To this Lord Ashburton replied that as the case had effectively > arisen after his departure from England he was 'not empowered to treat upon > the subject'. He reaffirmed the position that as slavery was no longer > recognized under British law, any foreign slave arriving in British > possessions was automatically considered as free ‚Äì as was also the case in > those American states that did not recognize slavery. He did however promise > that British officials in the West Indies would be given 'directions'...'to > do nothing in this respect when it can be properly avoided' in the interests > of 'good neighbourhood'.The Times, 15 September 1842, p. 5The correspondence > between Webster and Ashburton was published in The Works of Daniel Webster > (1853), vol. VI: Among other declarations, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty called for a final end to the slave trade on the high seas, to be enforced by both signatories. Seven lawsuits were lodged against insurance companies in Louisiana by slave owners who had suffered financial losses due to the revolt, as the insurance companies initially refused to compensate them. \\"Louisiana.

Earlier cases The Comet in 1830 and the Encomium in 1833 were American ships in the coastwise slave trade that were forced by weather into British Caribbean ports while carrying numerous slaves bound for the domestic market in New Orleans. The British freed both groups. Britain eventually paid compensation for these seizures, as it had not yet abolished slavery in its territories.Lord McNair, \\"5: Slavery and the Slave Trade\\", International Law Opinions, Cambridge University Press, 1956, p. 79 When Parliament abolished slavery in its territories in 1833, Britain advised other countries that slave ships that put into its ports would forfeit the slaves without compensation. After British abolition of slavery in its colonies, effective in 1834, its officials freed slaves from the Enterprise (1835), and the Hermosa (1840), without compensation. In 1840, the Hermosa, a US schooner in the coastwise slave trade carrying 38 slaves from Richmond to New Orleans for sale, went aground on one of the Abacos islands in the Bahamas. After wreckers took the ship to port, the captain refused to let the slaves off and, with the US consul, tried to arrange for another ship to take and deliver his slave cargo to the United States. British magistrates backed with armed force went onto the Hermosa, taking the slaves off and freeing them when they reached the port. The Americans protested. The Enterprise and Hermosa cases were submitted for arbitration under an 1853 claims treaty and, together with claims for the Creole and a variety of other unrelated claims dating to 1814, Britain paid a settlement in 1855 to the United States for these three cases. A total of nearly 450 American slaves achieved freedom due to British colonies' actions in these five cases.

He soon returned to Congress. # Resolved, That, prior to the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, each of the several States composing this Union exercised full and exclusive jurisdiction over the subject of slavery within its own territory, and possessed full power to continue or abolish it at pleasure. # Resolved, That, by adopting the Constitution, no part of the aforesaid powers were delegated to the Federal Government, but were reserved by and still pertain to each of the several States. # Resolved, That, by the 8th section of the 1st article of the Constitution, each of the several States surrendered to the Federal Government all jurisdiction over the subjects of commerce and navigation upon the high seas. # Resolved.

Between Third Avenue and Avenue A, it is named St. Mark's Place, after the nearby St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery on 10th Street at Second Avenue. St. Mark's Place is considered a main cultural street for the East Village. Vehicular traffic runs east along both one-way streets. St. Mark's Place features a wide variety of retailers. Venerable institutions lining St. Mark's Place include Gem Spa and the St. Mark's Hotel. There are several open front markets that sell sunglasses, clothing and jewelry. In her 400-year history of St. Mark's Place (St. Marks Is Dead), Ada Calhoun called the street \\"like superglue for fragmented identities\\" and wrote that \\"the street is not for people who have chosen their lives ... [it] is for the wanderer, the undecided, the lonely, and the promiscuous.\\" History =Early years= Wouter van Twiller, colonial governor of New Amsterdam, once owned a tobacco farm near 8th and MacDougal Streets. Such farms were located around the area until the 1830s. Nearby, a Native American trail crossed the island via the right-of-ways of Greenwich Avenue, Astor Place, and Stuyvesant Street. Under the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, a city grid for much of Manhattan was defined. Eighth Street was to run from Sixth Avenue in the west to Third Avenue and the Bowery to the east. The area west of Sixth Avenue was already developed as Greenwich Village. Mercer, Greene, Wooster, Thompson Street, Sullivan Street, and MacDougal Street, as well as Laurens Street (present-day LaGuardia Place), extended to Eighth Street until the 1820s, when the construction of Washington Square Park severed Laurens, Thompson, and Sullivan Streets south of 4th Street. =19th century= After the Commissioners' Plan was laid out, property along the street's right of way quickly developed. By 1835, the New York University opened its first building, the Silver Center, along Eighth Street near the Washington Square Park. Row houses were also built on Eighth Street. The street ran between the Jefferson Market, built in 1832 at the west end, and the Tompkins Market, built in 1836, at the east end. These were factors in the street's commercialization in later years. Eighth Street was supposed to extend to a market place at Avenue C, but since that idea never came to fruition. Capitalizing on the high-class status of Bond, Bleecker, Great Jones, and Lafayette Streets in NoHo, developer Thomas E. Davis developed the east end of the street and renamed it \\"St. Mark's Place\\". Davis built up St. Mark's Place between Third and Second Avenues between 1831 and 1832. Although the original plan was for Federal homes, only three such houses remained in 2014. Meanwhile, Eighth Street became home to a literary scene. At Astor Place and Eighth Street, the Astor Opera House was built by wealthy men and opened in 1847. Publisher Evert Augustus Duyckinck founded a private library at his 50 East Eighth Street home. Ann Lynch started a famous literary salon at 116 Waverly Place and relocated to 37 West Eighth Street in 1848. Around this time and up until the 1890s, Eighth Street was co-named Clinton Place in memory of politician DeWitt Clinton, whose widow lived along nearby University Place. In the 1850s, Eighth Street housed an educational scene as well. The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, a then-free institution for art, architecture and engineering education, was opened in 1858. The Century Club, an arts and letters association, relocated to 46 East Eighth Street around that time; the Bible House of the American Bible Society, was nearby. In addition, the Brevoort Hotel, as well as a marble mansion built by John Taylor Johnston, were erected at Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street. At the same time, German immigrants moved into the area around Tompkins Square Park. The area around St. Mark's Place was nicknamed Kleindeutschland, or \\"Little Germany\\", because of a huge influx of German immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s. Many of the homes turned into boarding houses, as the area had 50,000 residents but not a lot of real estate. Tenement housing was also built on St. Mark's Place. By the 1870s, apartments replaced stables and houses along the stretch of Eighth Street west of MacDougal Street. The elevated Third and Sixth Avenue Lines were also built during that time, with stops along the former at Ninth Street and along the latter at Eighth Street. Wanamaker Annex At the southwest corner of Broadway and Eighth Street, the street's first commercial building was built. By the 1890s, buildings on the stretch from Bowery to Fifth Avenue were used for trade. In 1904, the Wanamaker's Department Store opened at the former A.T. Stewart store along Broadway between 9th and 10th Streets, with an annex built at Eighth Street. =20th century= In the early 1900s, Little Germany was shrinking. At the same time, Jews, Hungarians, Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians from Eastern Europe started moving in. At this point, St. Mark's Place was considered a part of the Lower East Side. On the western stretch of Eighth Street, an art scene was growing. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Daniel Chester French, and other artists moved in the stables at Macdougal Alley at this time. By 1916, a studio complex for artists replaced most of these stables, making the areas around Eighth Street popular for bohemians. Whitney, a patron for other American painters, combined four houses on West Eighth Street houses into the Whitney Museum in 1931. The 1927 construction of the skyscraper at One Fifth Avenue, as well as the Eighth Street Playhouse movie theater, helped influence development on the Sixth Avenue end of the street, where construction of the IND Eighth Avenue Line had required destruction of many buildings there. On an adjoining block, the Women's House of Detention was built in Jefferson Market complex in 1929‚Äì1932 and existed through the 1970s. In the 1930s, after Prohibition ended, West Eighth Street became an entertainment area. Around that time, the New York School movement for abstract expressionist painters was centered around Eighth Street, with many such painters moving to Eighth Street. After World War II, property along 8th Street was converted to apartment houses. The Rhinelander Estate, one of the major landowners on Eighth Street, erected a building between Washington Square North, Fifth Avenue, West Eighth Street, and the Whitney Museum site. Sailor's Snug Harbor, the other major land owner, demolished the blocks from Fifth Avenue to Broadway on the north side of Eighth and Ninth Streets, including the popular Brevoort Hotel. It replaced these blocks mainly with low-rise apartment buildings and stores, as well as two high-rises. Around this time, West Eighth Street was also becoming the location of neighborhood commerce. After the elevated train lines were demolished in the 1940s and 1950s, the real estate industry tried to entice residents to the St. Mark's Place area, describing the neighborhood as \\"East Village\\". This area became home to an underground scene, and as it was far from public transportation, it became rundown. A 1965 Newsweek article described the East Village by telling readers to \\"head east from Greenwich Village, and when it starts to look squalid, around the Bowery and Third Avenue, you know you're there.\\" In the 1960s, Macdougal and West Eighth Streets, as well as St. Mark's Place, became a popular area for hippies. A women's clothing store, a pharmacy, and bookstores were replaced by fast food restaurants and other shops, directed toward the area's tourism base. By 1968, St, Mark's Place became a stopping point for tour buses, which formerly skipped the area. In 1977, St. Marks Place became the epicenter of all things Punk Rock, when Manic Panic opened its doors on July 7, 1977 (7/7/77). The shop quickly attracted musicians from Cyndi Lauper to the Ramones. In 1980, hot dog company Nathan's Famous moved into the location of a former bookstore on Eighth Street, to the anger of some Greenwich Village residents. However, other establishments, such as the B. Dalton bookstore, clothing stores, and shoe stores, started to attract tourists to the area. By the 1990s, the areas around both Eighth Street and St. Mark's Place were becoming rapidly gentrified, with new buildings and establishments being developed along both streets. The Village Alliance Business Improvement District was formed in 1993 to care for the area around Eighth Street. Notable buildings and sites The original location of the Whitney Museum, three converted townhouses at 8‚Äì12 West 8th Street =8th Street= East *127 Avenue B, also known as 295 East 8th Street, on Tompkins Square Park, was originally the Tompkins Square Lodging House for Boys and Industrial School. It was designed by Vaux & Radford and built in 1887. The building later became the Children's Aid Society Newsboy and Bootblacks Lodging House, and was briefly a synagogue, Talmud Torah Darchei Noam. The building was restored in 2006, and is now apartments. The building was featured prominently in the 2002 film, In America. *The stucco-faced apartment building at 4‚Äì26 East 8th Street between Fifth Avenue and University Place was built in 1834‚Äì36 and remodeled in 1916. It was designed by Harvey Wiley Corbett, and has been described as a \\"stage set, symbolic of the 'village' of a bohemian artist.' *The residential apartment building at One Fifth Avenue, on the southeast corner of East 8th Street, was built in 1929 and was designed by Helme, Corbett & Harrison and Sugarman & Berger. The brown brick building features numerous step-backs, battlements, buttresses and other suggestions of medieval architecture. *The full-block building on 8th Street bordered by Lafayette Street, 9th Street and Broadway, which carries the addresses 499 Lafayette Avenue and 770 Broadway, was built in 1902 to be the Annex for the giant John Wanamaker's Department Store located one block north between 9th and 10th Streets. The two buildings were connected by a skybridge over 9th Street which was dubbed the \\"Bridge of Progress\\". The main store was destroyed by fire in 1955, but the Annex building remains, and currently houses a Kmart and a GAP retail stores, as well as offices. *Across the street, also between Lafayette Street and Broadway, 8th Street runs behind Clinton Hall at 13 Astor Place, also known as 21 Astor Place. This was once the site of the Astor Opera House outside of which the Astor Place Riot occurred. The Opera House opened in 1847 and closed in 1890 to be replaced by the current building, designed by George E. Harney, which became the site of the New York Mercantile Library. The library left the 11-story building in 1932, and it has since been a union headquarters (District 65 of the Distributive Workers of America), the Astor Place Hotel, and, as of 1995, condominiums.\\"Clinton Hall\\" on Forgotten New York West *Marlton House at 3‚Äì5 West 8th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in Greenwich Village was built in 1900 as the Marlton Hotel, a single room occupancy (SRO) facility. It was notable for its bohemian clientele, but since 1987 it has been used as a dormitory for The New School. *The three former 1838 row houses at 8‚Äì12 West 8th Street between Fifth Avenue and Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village were converted in 1931 by Auguste L. Noel of Noel & Miller into the first home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, which sculptor and heiress Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney had established in 1929, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art rejected the donation of her extensive collection of contemporary and avant-garde artworks. In 1914, Whitney had started the Whitney Studio at 8 West 8th Street, just behind her own studio on MacDougal Alley. The museum was located here until 1954, when it moved uptown. The building is currently, along with 14 West 8th Street (built in 1900), the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture.. 54 The German- American Shooting Society clubhouse at #12 Arlington Hall at #19‚Äì23, c.1892 =St. Mark's Place= * #2 ‚Äì Beginning in 1962 it housed The Five-Spot, one of the city's leading jazz clubs.

Van Wyck, the candle and oil merchant. The building was owned from 1863 to 1903 by butter merchant John W. Miller, who added a two-story addition and a meeting hall on the first floor. From 1901 until 1952 the building was owned by the C. Meisel company, a manufacturer of musical instruments. Between 1955 and 1967 it housed the Tempo Playhouse, New Bowery Theatre, and Bridge Theatre, noted for experimental theater, music, dance, and independent film. In 1964 it housed the New Bowery Theatre, a showcase for the American Theatre of Poets.

Education and career  He was born in Boston and brought up in Massachusetts, at Brookline and Worcester.Donald Schon at infed.org accessed July 2007 After doing a Bachelor's at Yale University, he completed Master's and doctoral studies in philosophy at Harvard University. His thesis dealt with Dewey's theory of inquiry. He also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and pursued advanced study in music (Piano and clarinet). For many years Sch√∂n was with the large consulting firm, Arthur D. Little along with Raymond Hainer with whom he worked on his ideas which resulted in his first seminal work, The Displacement of Concepts. In fact this original work was a new interpretation on the history of the ideas of all time‚Äîa complement to Thomas Kuhn's work or even a more accurate look at the dynamics of invention. His later works there presaged a lifetime of interest in the subtle processes whereby technological and other change is absorbed (or not) by social systems. In 1970, he delivered the Reith Lectures for the BBC, on how learning occurs within organizations and societies that are in permanent states of flux. These presentations were published subsequently in his Beyond the Stable State. Donald Sch√∂n became a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968 and stayed on with an appointment in 1972 as Ford Professor of Urban Studies and Education. He remained there until his death in 1997. During these decades his long collaboration with adult education/organizational behavior expert Chris Argyris yielded key insights into the question of how organizations develop, adapt, learn or fail in these critical missions. Their collaboration led to two books in the 1970s‚Äî Theory in Practice and Organizational Learning‚Äîthe latter of which was completely revised and published in 1996 as Organizational Learning II.  Contributions  Donald Sch√∂n introduced several important organizing concepts to a wide range of applied fields. He proposed the idea of a \\"generative metaphor\\", figurative descriptions of social situations, usually implicit and even semi-conscious but that shape the way problems are tackled. This is demonstrated in seeing a troubled inner city neighborhood as urban \\"blight\\" and, hence, taking steps rooted in the idea of disease. Sch√∂n also developed the concept of \\"learning systems\\" as he pioneered the studies that aimed to explore the possibility of learning at the supra-individual level. In 1971, he identified a state's government as an example of a learning system in the book Beyond the Stable State. Two years later, he further explained that \\"a learning system must be one which dynamic conservatism operates at such a level in such a way as to permit change of state, without intolerable threat to the essential functions the system fulfils for the self.\\" Sch√∂n devoted a trilogy of books, which included The Reflective Practitioner (1983), to his argument for reflection and his notion of the reflective practice inquiry. This emerged out of a self-described inability to understand the process of planning, which included his failure to determine what his students learned from field work experience. Sch√∂n then addressed this problem when he developed his \\"reflection-in-action\\" notion explained in the book. This involved the examination of the thinking, talking, and interacting processes through a series of case studies involving different professionals. His model challenged practitioners to reconsider the role of technical knowledge versus \\"artistry\\" in developing professional excellence. The concept most notably affected study of teacher education, health and social care professions and architectural design. This was demonstrated in the way it influenced constructivist teacher education reformers, who studied architectural and other professional practices. Sch√∂n also criticized what he called as the commitment on the part of institution's of higher learning to a view of knowledge that feature a \\"selective inattention to professional competence\\". In the context of reflective practice, Sch√∂n suggested the replacement of the dominant epistemology of technical rationalism with his reflection-in-action framework. His work contributed to the transition MIT's Department of City and Regional Planning to the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. Sch√∂n also developed Conversation with the Situation - an approach to understand the design process. Through a series of case studies, he explained that the pattern of thinking, talking, and interacting for different types of professionals identified as designers (architects, city planner, engineer, psychoanalyst, scientist, and business manager) are similar with the way they perform strategic moves that is analogous to \\"talking to the situation\\" and following which the situation \\"talks back\\". Together with his MIT colleague Martin Rein, Sch√∂n outlined in 1994 the so-called frame reflection, which prescribed critical shared reconstruction of \\"frames\\" of social problems which are otherwise taken for granted and advocated system-level learning to find solutions for \\"intractable policy controversies.\\" Sch√∂n maintained that a shift is needed in the frame of our perception - from the currently accepted framework to critical reflection and transformational learning. Much of his later work related to reflection in practice and the concept of learning systems. He (along with Chris Argyris) maintained that organizations and individuals should be flexible and should incorporate lessons learned throughout their lifespans, known as organizational learning. His interest and involvement in jazz music inspired him to teach the concept of improvisation and 'thinking on one's feet', and that through a feedback loop of experience, learning and practice, we can continually improve our work (whether educational or not) and become a 'reflective practitioner'. Thus, the work of Sch√∂n fits with and extends to the realm of many fields of practice, key twentieth century theories of education, like experiential education and the work of many of its most important theorists, namely John Dewey, Kurt Lewin, Carl Rogers and David A. Kolb. Sch√∂n believed that people and organizations should be flexible and incorporate their life experiences and lessons learned throughout their life. This is also known as Organizational learning (Fulmer, 1994).Fulmer, Robert M. \\"A model for changing the way organizations learn.\\" Planning Review [a publication of the Planning Forum] May‚ÄìJune 1994:20+. General OneFile. Web. Organizational learning is based on two things. The first being single‚Äìloop learning and the second being double‚Äìloop learning. The former refers to the process that occurs when organizations adjust their operations to keep apace with changing market conditions. And then the latter refers to not just adjusting to the market, but also to the creation of new and better ways of achieving business goals (Fulmer, 1994).  Personal life  Donald Sch√∂n was married to sculptor Nancy Sch√∂nNancy Sch√∂n who is particularly well known for her installation in the Boston Public Garden of the bronze duck family from McCloskey's children's classic \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\". Nancy Sch√∂n completed a sequence of works titled \\"The Reflective Giraffe\\" in tribute to her late husband with a giraffe as the central icon. Major works *The Displacement of Concepts.

Technical writing encompasses the largest sub-field in technical communication.What is Technical Communications? TechWhirl. Accessed December 9, 2014. The Society for Technical Communication defines technical communication as any form of communication that exhibits one or more of the following characteristics: \\"(1) communicating about technical or specialized topics, such as computer applications, medical procedures, or environmental regulations; (2) communicating by using technology, such as web pages, help files, or social media sites; or (3) providing instructions about how to do something, regardless of how technical the task is\\". Overview Technical writing is performed by a technical writer (or technical author) and is the process of writing and sharing technical information in a professional setting. A technical writer's primary task is to communicate technical information to another person or party in the clearest and most effective manner possible. The information that technical writers communicate is often complex so strong writing and communication skills are essential. They do not only convey information through text, they must be proficient with computers as well. Technical writers use a wide range of programs to create and edit illustrations, diagramming programs to create visual aids, and document processors to design, create, and format documents. While technical writing is commonly associated with online help and user manuals, the term technical documentation can cover a wider range of genres and technologies. Press releases, memos, reports, business proposals, datasheets, product descriptions and specifications, white papers, r√©sum√©s, and job applications are but a few examples of writing that can be considered technical documentation. Some types of technical documentation are not typically handled by technical writers. For example, a press release is usually written by a public relations writer, though a technical writer might have input on any technical information included in the press release. History While technical writing has only been recognized as a profession since World War II, its roots can be traced to classical antiquity. Critics cite the works of writers like Aristotle as the earliest forms of technical writing. Geoffrey Chaucer's work, Treatise on the Astrolabe, is an early example of a technical document and is considered to be the first technical document published in English. With the invention of the mechanical printing press, the onset of the Renaissance and the rise of the Age of Reason, documenting findings became a necessity. Inventors and scientists like Isaac Newton and Leonardo da Vinci prepared documents that chronicled their inventions and findings. While never called technical documents during their period of publication, these documents played a crucial role in developing modern forms of technical communication and writing. The field of technical communication grew during the Industrial Revolution. There was an increasing need to provide people with instructions for using the more and more complex machines that were being invented. However, unlike the past, where skills were handed down through oral traditions, no one besides the inventors knew how to use these new devices. Writing thus became the fastest and most effective way to disseminate information, and writers who could document these devices were desired. During the 20th century, the need for technical writing skyrocketed, and the profession finally became officially recognized. The events of World War I and World War II led to advances in medicine, military hardware, computer technology, and aerospace technologies. This rapid growth, coupled with the urgency of war, created an immediate need for well-designed and written documents that chronicled the use of these technologies. Technical writing was in high demand during this time, and \\"technical writer\\" became an official job title during World War II. Following World War II, technological advances led to an increase in consumer goods and standards of living. During the post-war boom, public services like libraries and universities, as well as transport systems like buses and highways, saw massive amounts of growth. The need for writers to chronicle these processes increased. It was also during this period that computers started being used in large businesses and universities. Notably, in 1949, Joseph D. Chapline authored the first computational technical document, an instruction manual for the BINAC computer. The discovery of the transistor in 1947 allowed computers to be produced cheaper than ever before. These reduced prices meant that computers could now be purchased by individuals and small businesses. And as a result of the computer's growing prominence, the need for writers who could explain and document these devices grew. The profession of technical writing saw further expansion during the 1970s and 1980s as consumer electronics found their way into the homes of more and more people. In recent years, the prominence of computers in society has led to many advances in the field of digital communications, leading to changes in the tools technical writers use. Hypertext, word processors, graphics editing programs, and page layout software have made the creation of technical documents faster and easier than ever before, and technical writers of today must be proficient in these programs. Techniques Good technical writing is concise, focused, easy to understand, free of errors, and audience-based. Technical writers focus on making their documents as clear as possible, avoiding overly technical phrases and stylistic choices like passive voice and nominalizations. Because technical documents are used in real-world situations, it should always be explicitly clear what the subject matter of a technical document is and how to use the presented information. It would be disastrous if, for example, a technical writer's instructions on how to use a high-powered X-ray machine were difficult to decipher. Technical writing requires a writer to extensively examine their audience. A technical writer needs to be aware of their audience's existing knowledge about the material they are discussing as the knowledge base of the writer's audience determines the content and focus of a document. For example, an evaluation report discussing a scientific study's findings that is written to a group of highly skilled scientists will be very differently constructed than one intended for the general public. Technical writers do not have to be subject-matter experts (SMEs) themselves. They often collaborate with SMEs to complete tasks that require more knowledge about a subject than they possess. Technical writing must be accurate. A technical writer, after analyzing their audience, knows what they need to communicate and then needs to convey the message in an accurate and ethical manner. Physical, environmental, or financial repercussions could result if a writer does this incorrectly. Knowing the audience is essential to accuracy because the language will be tailored according to what they already understand about the subject at hand. For example, instructions on how to correctly and safely assemble a bookshelf are included with purchase. Those instructions are constructed so that anyone can follow along, including accurate details as to where each fastener goes. If those instructions were inaccurate, the bookshelf could be unstable and fail.Diane Martinez, et. al., \\"Technical Writing: A Comprehensive Resource of Technical Writers at All Levels.\\" Document design and layout are also vital components of technical writing. Technical writers spend large amounts of time ensuring their documents are readable because a poorly designed document hampers a reader's comprehension. Technical document design stresses proper usage of document design choices like bullet points, font-size, and bold text. Images, diagrams, and videos are also commonly employed by technical writers because these media can often convey complex information, like a company's annual earnings or a product's design features, far more efficiently than text. Technical documents Technical writing covers many genres and writing styles, depending on the information and audience. Technical documents are not solely produced by technical writers. Almost anyone who works in a professional setting produces technical documents of some variety. Some examples of technical documentation include: *Instructions and procedures are documents that help either developers or end- users operate or configure a device or program. Examples of instructional documents include user manuals and troubleshooting guides for computer programs, computer hardware, household products, medical equipment, mechanical products, and automobiles. *Proposals. Most projects begin with a proposal‚Äîa document that describes the purpose of a project, the tasks that will be performed in the project, the methods used to complete the project, and finally, the cost of the project. Proposals cover a wide range of subjects. For example, a technical writer may author a proposal that outlines how much it will cost to install a new computer system, a marketing professional may write a proposal with the product offerings, and a teacher may write a proposal that outlines how a new biology class will be structured. *Emails, letters, and memoranda are some of the most frequently written documents in a business. Letters and emails can be constructed with a variety of goals‚Äîsome are usually aimed at simply communicating information while others are designed to persuade the recipient to accomplish a certain task. While letters are usually written to people outside of a company, memoranda (memos) are documents written to other employees within the business. *Press releases. When a company wants to publicly reveal a new product or service, they will have a writer author a press release. This is a document that describes the product's functions and value to the public.Perelman, Leslie C., Barrett, Edward, and Paradis James. \\"Press jaylan peregrino\\". The Mayfield grave naba Handbook of Technical & Scientific Writing. Retrieved May 4, 2014. *Specifications are design outlines that describe the structure, parts, packaging, and delivery of an object or process in enough detail that another party can reconstruct it.Perelman, Leslie C., Barrett, Edward, and Paradis James. \\"Specifications.\\" The Mayfield Handbook of Technical & Scientific Writing. Retrieved May 4, 2014. For example, a technical writer might diagram and write the specifications for a smartphone or bicycle so that a manufacturer can produce the object. *Descriptions are shorter explanations of procedures and processes that help readers understand how something works. For example, a technical writer might author a document that shows the effects of greenhouse gases or demonstrates how the braking system on a bike functions. *R√©sum√©s and job applications are another example of technical documents. They are documents that are used in a professional setting to inform readers of the author's credentials. *Technical reports are written to provide readers with information, instructions, and analysis for tasks. Reports come in many forms. For example, a technical writer might evaluate a building that is for sale and produce a trip report that highlights his or her findings and whether he or she believes the building should be purchased. Another writer who works for a non-profit company may publish an evaluation report that shows the findings of the company's research into air pollution. *Case study is a published report about a person, group, or situation that has been studied over time; also : a situation in real life that can be looked at or studied to learn about something. For example, an individual's challenging situation at his or her workplace and how he or she resolved it is a case study. *White papers are documents that are written for experts in a field and typically describe a solution to a technological or business challenge or problem. Examples of white papers include a piece that details how to make a business stand out in the market or a piece explaining how to prevent cyber-attacks on businesses. *Websites. The advent of hypertext has changed the way documents are read, organized, and accessed. Technical writers of today are often responsible for authoring pages on websites like \\"About Us\\" pages or product pages. They are often expected to be proficient in web development tools. *Datasheets are the documents that summarize the features, key specifications, technical characteristics, application circuits, and some other important information about the product, machine, equipment, software, application, or system in brief. *API guides are written for the developer community and are used to explain the application programming interfaces. *Help systems are online help centers that provide users with technical information about products and services. They provide content as web pages that are viewed in a browser. The content may be created in help center software, such as Zendesk, or in help authoring tools or component content management systems that can create a help center as an HTML output. Tools The following tools are used by technical writers to author and present documents: *Desktop publishing tools or word processors. Technical writers use word processors such as Scrivener, Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, and LibreOffice Writer to author, edit, design, and print documents. Since technical writing is as much about page layout as it is the written language, enhanced desktop publishing tools such as Adobe InDesign and LyX are also used.Johnson, Tom \\"What Tools Do Technical Writers Use\\". I'd Rather Be Writing. December 19, 2011. Retrieved May 4, 2014. These programs function similarly to word processors but provide users with more options and features for the document's design and automate much of the formatting.\\"What is LyX\\". LyX. Retrieved May 9, 2014. *Help authoring tools. These are used by technical writers to create the help systems that are packaged with software products, delivered through web browsers or provided as files users can view on their computers. When writing instructional procedures to describe mechanical, electrical, or software programs, technical writers use these tools to assist them in simplifying assembly, operation, or installation processes. *Component Content Management Systems. These are also used by technical writers to create help systems and documents. Component Content Management Systems (CCMS) allow writers to create similar outputs as help authoring tools, but they also provide content management features such as version management and built-in workflows. *Image editing software. Often, images and other visual elements can communicate information better than paragraphs of text. In these instances, image editing software like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP are used by technical writers to create and edit the visual aspects of documents like photos, icons and diagrams. *Collaborative software programs. Because technical writing often involves communication between multiple individuals who work for different companies, it can be a collaborative affair. Technical writers use Wiki Systems and shared document work-spaces to work with other writers and parties to construct technical documents. *Web development tools. Technical writer jobs are no longer limited to just producing documents. They sometimes also produce content for a company's corporate and other professional web sites. Technical writers might therefore be expected to be proficient in Web development tools like Adobe Dreamweaver. *Text editor. Programs such as Microsoft Notepad, TextEdit, or Wordstar allow technical writers to edit plain text. Text editors can be used to change content such as configuration files, documentation files, and programming language source code. Text editors are widely used by technical writers working with online content. *Graphing software. To communicate statistical information such as the number of visits to a restaurant or the amount of money a university spends on its sporting programs, technical writers use graphs and flowcharts. While programs like Microsoft Excel and Word can create basic graphs and charts, sometimes technical writers must produce more complex and detailed graphs that require functions not available in these programs and may need to turn to graphing and diagramming tools (e.g., Microsoft Visio). *Screen capture tools. Technical writers frequently use screen-capture tools like Camtasia and Snagit. When creating instructions for computer software, it may be easier for a technical writer to simply record a short video of their desktops as they complete a task than it would be to write a lengthy series of instructions that describe how the task must be performed. Screen capture tools are also used to take screenshots of programs and software running on user's computers and then to create accompanying diagrams.

He was born in Phlius, moved to Megara, and then he returned home and married. He next went to Elis with his wife, and heard Pyrrho, whose tenets he adopted. He also lived on the Hellespont, and taught at Chalcedon, before moving to Athens, where he lived until his death. His writings were said to have been very numerous. He composed poetry, tragedies, satiric dramas, and comedies, of which very little remains. His most famous composition was his Silloi, a satirical account of famous philosophers, living and dead; a spoudaiogeloion in hexameter verse. The Silloi has not survived intact, but it is mentioned and quoted by several ancient authors. It has been suggested that Pyrrhonism ultimately originated with Timon rather than Pyrrho.Brunschwig, (1999), pp. 249‚Äì251. Life A fairly full account of Timon's life was given by Diogenes La√´rtius, from the first book of a work on the Silloi by Apollonides of Nicaea; and some particulars are quoted by Diogenes from Antigonus of Carystus, and from Sotion.Diogenes La√´rtius, ix. c. 12. ¬ß¬ß 109‚Äì115 He was a native of Phlius, and was the son of Timarchus. Being left an orphan while still young, he was at first a dancer in the theatre, but he abandoned this profession for the study of philosophy, and, having moved to Megara, he spent some time with Stilpo, and then he returned home and married. He next went to Elis with his wife, and heard Pyrrho, whose tenets he adopted, so far at least as his restless genius and satirical scepticism permitted him to follow any master. During his residence at Elis, he had children born to him, the eldest of whom, named Xanthus, he instructed in the art of medicine and trained in his philosophical principles. Driven again from Elis by straitened circumstances, he spent some time on the Hellespont and the Propontis, and taught at Chalcedon as a sophist with such success that he made a fortune. He then moved to Athens, where he lived until his death, with the exception of a short residence at Thebes. Among the great men with whom he became personally acquainted in the course of his travels were the kings Antigonus and Ptolemy II Philadelphus. He was also linked to several literary figures such as: Zopyrus of Clazomenae;Diog. Laert. 9.114 Alexander Aetolus and Homerus, whom he is said to have assisted in the composition of their tragedies; and Aratus, whom he is said to have taught.Suda, Aratos. He died at an age of almost ninety. Character Timon appears to have been endowed by nature with a powerful and active mind, and with a quick perception of the weaknesses of people, which made him a skeptic in philosophy and a satirist in everything. According to Diogenes La√´rtius, Timon was a one-eyed man; and he used even to make a jest of his own defect, calling himself Cyclops. Some other examples of his bitter sarcasms are recorded by Diogenes; one of which is worth quoting as a maxim in criticism: being asked by Aratus how to obtain the pure text of Homer, he replied, \\"If we could find the old copies, and not those with modern emendations.\\" He is also said to have been fond of retirement, and of gardening; but Diogenes introduces this statement and some others in such a way as to suggest a doubt whether they ought to be referred to our Timon or to Timon of Athens, or whether they apply equally to both. Writings The writings of Timon are represented as very numerous. According to Diogenes La√´rtius, he composed \\"lyric and epic poems, and tragedies and satiric dramas, and thirty comedies, and sixty tragedies and the Silloi and amatory poems.\\" His work is frequently quoted by Sextus Empiricus, also a follower of Pyrrho. Apart from the fragments of the Silloi, most of what survives of Timon's work is what Diogenes La√´rtius and Sextus chose to quote and what Eusebius preserved in Praeparatio evangelica quoting Aristocles quoting Timon's book Python in which Timon describes encountering Pyrrho the grounds of an Amphiareion while they were both on a pilgrimage to Delphi.Eusebius of Caesaria Praeparatio Evangelica Chapter 18 and in which Pyrrho provides this summary of his philosophy: > \\"Whoever wants to live well (eudaimonia) must consider these three > questions: First, how are pragmata (ethical matters, affairs, topics) by > nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what > will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?\\" Pyrrho's answer is > that \\"As for pragmata they are all adiaphora (undifferentiated by a logical > differentia), astathmƒìta (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and > anepikrita (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). Therefore, neither our sense- > perceptions nor our doxai (views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or > lie; so we certainly should not rely on them. Rather, we should be adoxastoi > (without views), aklineis (uninclined toward this side or that), and > akradantoi (unwavering in our refusal to choose), saying about every single > one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither > is nor is not. =Poetry= No remains of his dramas have survived. Of his epic poems little is known, but it may be presumed that they were chiefly ludicrous or satirical poems in the epic form. Possibly his Python (), which contained a long account of a conversation with Pyrrho, during a journey to the Delphic oracle, may be referred to this class; unless it was in prose.Diogenes La√´rtius, ix. 64, 105; Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, xiv. It appears probable that his Funeral Banquet of Arcesilaus was a satirical poem in epic verse.Diogenes La√´rtius, ix. 115; Athenaeus, ix. 406 He also wrote parodies on Homer, and some lines from a scepticism-themed poem in elegiac verse have been preserved, as well as one or two fragments which cannot be with certainty assigned to any of his poems. The most celebrated of his poems, however, were the satiric compositions called Silloi, a word of somewhat uncertain etymology, but which undoubtedly describes metrical compositions, of a character at once ludicrous and sarcastic. The invention of this species of poetry is ascribed to Xenophanes of Colophon. The Silloi of Timon were in three books, in the first of which he spoke in his own person, and the other two are in the form of a dialogue between the author and Xenophanes, in which Timon proposed questions, to which Xenophanes replied at length. The subject was a sarcastic account of the tenets of all philosophers, living and dead; an unbounded field for scepticism and satire. They were in hexameter verse, and, from the way in which they are mentioned by the ancient writers, as well as from the few fragments of them which have survived, it is evident that they were admirable productions of their kind.Diogenes La√´rtius, ix. 115; Aristocles ap. Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, xiv.; Suda, Sillainei, Timon; Athenaeus, passim; Aulus Gellius, iii. 17. Commentaries were written on the Silloi by Apollonides of Nicaea, and also by Sotion of Alexandria.Athenaeus, viii. 336 The poem entitled Images () in elegiac verse, appears to have been similar in its subject to the Silloi.Diogenes La√´rtius, ix. 65 Diogenes La√´rtius also mentions Timon's iamboi,Diogenes La√´rtius, ix. 110 but perhaps the word is here merely used in the sense of satirical poems in general, without reference to the metre. According to Timon, philosophers are \\"excessively cunning murderers of many wise saws\\" (v. 96); the only two whom he spares are Xenophanes, \\"the modest censor of Homer's lies\\" (v. 29), and Pyrrho, against whom \\"no other mortal dare contend\\" (v. 126). =Prose= He also wrote in prose, to the quantity, according to Diogenes La√´rtius, of twenty thousand lines. These works were no doubt on philosophical subjects, and Diogenes mentions On Sensations, On Inquiries, and Towards Wisdom. Also among his lost works is Against the Physicists, in which he questioned the legitimacy of making hypotheses.Sextus Empiricus, Against the Geometers, 2. in Sextus Empiricus IV: Against the Professors.

On 18 January 1944 at Kyauchaw, British Burma (now Myanmar), Lieutenant Horwood accompanied a company into action with his forward mortar observation post. Throughout the day he was in an exposed position and under intense fire, but he came back at night with most valuable information about the enemy. On 19 January he moved forward and established another observation post, directing accurate mortar fire in support of two attacks, and also carrying out personal reconnaissance, deliberately drawing the enemy fire so that their position could be definitely located.

He was a contemporary of Theophrastus, Diodorus Cronus, and Crates of Thebes. None of his writings survive, he was interested in logic and dialectic, and he argued that the universal is fundamentally separated from the individual and concrete. His ethical teachings approached that of the Cynics and Stoics. His most important followers were Pyrrho, the founder of Pyrrhonism, and Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism. Life He was a native of Megara. He probably lived after the time of Euclid of Megara, which makes it unlikely that he was a pupil of Euclid, as stated by some;; Suda, Stilpo and others state that he was the pupil of Thrasymachus of Corinth, or of Pasicles, the brother of Crates of Thebes.Suda, Stilpo; cf. Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 89 According to one account, he engaged in dialectic encounters with Diodorus Cronus at the court of Ptolemy Soter; according to another, he did not comply with the invitation of the king, to go to Alexandria. We are further told that Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, honoured him no less, spared his house at the capture of Megara, and offered him indemnity for the injury which it had received, which, however, Stilpo declined.; Plutarch, Demetr. c. 9, etc. Uniting elevated sentiment with gentleness and patience, he, as Plutarch says,Plutarch, Colot. c. 22 was an ornament to his country and friends, and had his acquaintance sought by kings. His original propensity to wine and voluptuousness he is said to have entirely overcome;Cicero, de Fato, c. 5 in inventive power and dialectic art to have surpassed his contemporaries, and to have inspired almost all Greece with a devotion to Megarian philosophy. A number of distinguished men too are named, whom he is said to have drawn away from Theophrastus, Aristotle of Cyrene, and others, and attached to himself; among others Crates the Cynic, and Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school. Among his followers were Menedemus and Asclepiades, the leaders of the Eretrian school of philosophy. One of his pupils, Nicarete, was also said to have been his mistress.Athenaeus, xiii. 596e; . Stilpo was praised for his political wisdom, his simple, straightforward disposition, and the equanimity with which he tolerated his rebellious daughter.; comp. Plutarch, de tranqu. animi, c. 6 Cicero relates that Stilpo's friends had described him as \\"vehemently addicted to wine and women\\", but that his philosophy eliminated his inclinations.Cicero, De Fato, 5 Philosophy Of the dialogues ascribed to him, we know only the titles. He belonged to the Megarian school of philosophy, but we learn only a little about his doctrines in the few fragments and sayings of his which are quoted. =Logic= Stilpo argued that the genus, the universal, is not contained in the individual and concrete. \\"Whoever speaks of any person, speaks of no-one, for he neither speaks of this one nor that. For why should it rather be of this one than that? Hence it is not of this one\\". One of his examples was that \\"the vegetable is not what is here shown. For a vegetable existed ten thousand years ago, therefore this here is not a vegetable\\". According to Simplicius, \\"the so-called Megarians took it as ascertained that what has different determinations is different, and that the diverse are separated one from the other, they seemed to prove that each thing is separated from itself. Hence since the musical Socrates is another determination from the wise Socrates, Socrates was separated from himself.\\"Simplicius, in Phys. Ausc. f. 26, quoted by Thus one thing cannot be predicated of another, that is, the essence of things cannot be reached by means of predicates. Plutarch quotes Stilpo as arguing: > To be a horse differs from to be running. For being asked the definition of > the one and of the other, we do not give the same for them both; and > therefore those err who predicate the one of the other. For if good is the > same with people, and to run the same with a horse, how is good affirmed > also of food and medicine, and again (by Jupiter) to run of a lion and a > dog? But if the predicate is different, then we do not rightly say that a > person is good, and a horse runs.Plutarch, adv. Colot. 22, 23 Plutarch remarks here that Colotes attacked Stilpo in a bombastic manner as though he ignored common life: \\"for how shall we live, if we cannot style a man good, nor a man a captain, but must separately name a man a man, good good, and a captain a captain.\\" But Plutarch, in turn, replied, \\"but what man lived any the worse for this? Is there any man who hears this said, and who does not understand it to be the speech of a man who rallies gallantly, and proposes to others this logical question to exercise their mind?\\" =Ethics= Stilpo seems to have been interested in Virtue, and its self-sufficiency. He maintained that the wise man ought not only to overcome every evil, but not even to be affected by any, not even to feel it,Seneca, Epistles, ix. 1, 18; comp. Plutarch de Tranqu. animi, 6, . showing, perhaps, how closely allied Stilpo was to the contemporary Cynics: This story was an inspiration for Friedrich Klinger's Sturm und Drang play Stilpo und seine Kinder (Stilpo and his Children) written in 1777 and published in 1780. A one-page fragment or paraphrase from a work concerning exile is preserved in the writings of Teles of Megara, a 3rd-century BC Cynic. In this fragment, Stilpo divides the good into three parts: goods of the soul, goods of the body, and external goods. He then demonstrates that exile does not deprive a person of any of these three goods.

Its ethical teachings were derived from Socrates, recognizing a single good, which was apparently combined with the Eleatic doctrine of Unity. Some of Euclides' successors developed logic to such an extent that they became a separate school, known as the Dialectical school. Their work on modal logic, logical conditionals, and propositional logic played an important role in the development of logic in antiquity. History The Megarian school of philosophy was founded by Euclides of Megara, who had been one of the pupils of Socrates in the late 5th century BC.Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 47 His successors, as head of the school in Megara, were said to have been Ichthyas (mid 4th century BC), and Stilpo (late 4th century BC).Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 113 It is unlikely, however, that the Megarian school was a genuine institution, nor did it have a unified philosophical position. It was said that the philosophers of the school were first called Megarians and that later they were called Eristics, and then Dialecticians,Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 106 but it is probable that these names designated splinter groups distinct from the Megarian school. Besides Ichthyas, Euclides' most important pupils were Eubulides of MiletusDiogenes La√´rtius, ii. 108 and Clinomachus of Thurii.Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 112 It seems to have been under Clinomachus that a separate Dialectical school was founded, Although the name \\"Dialectical school\\" was apparently coined by Dionysius of Chalcedon, (Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 106) which placed great emphasis on logic and dialectic, and Clinomachus was said to have been \\"the first to write about propositions and predicates.\\" However, Euclides himself taught logic,Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 107 and his pupil, Eubulides, who was famous for employing celebrated paradoxes, was the teacher of several later dialecticians. Via Stilpo, the Megarian school is said to have influenced Pyrrho, the Eretrian school under Menedemus and Asclepiades, and Zeno, the founder of Stoicism. Zeno was said to have studied under Stilpo and Diodorus Cronus,Diogenes La√´rtius, vii. 16 and to have disputed with Philo the Dialectician. It was perhaps the Dialecticians, Diodorus and Philo, who were the biggest influence on the development of Stoic logic, and that Zeno studied under Stilpo to learn his moral teachings, although Stilpo, too, is said to have excelled \\"in the invention of arguments and in sophistry.\\" Philosophy Euclides had been a pupil of Socrates, but ancient historians regarded him as a successor to the Eleatics, hence his philosophy was seen as a fusion of Eleatic and Socratic thought. Thus the Eleatic idea of \\"The One\\" was identified with the Socratic \\"Form of the Good,\\"Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 106; Cicero, Academica, ii. 42 and the opposite of Good was regarded by Euclides as non-existent. But the emphasis of his thought is not on being but on the good, and idea that what is opposite to the good does not exist arises from the understanding of the good's unity. This theme is typically Socratic; what matters is the moral good and the will of the good person to strive towards it. Stilpo is said to have continued the Eleatic tendency, by asserting a strict monism and denying all change and motion,Aristocles, in Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica xiv. 16. 1 and he also rejected Plato's Theory of Forms.Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 119 In ethics, Stilpo taught freedom, self-control, and self-sufficiency, approaching the teachings of the Cynics, another Socratic school. Besides studying logical puzzles and paradoxes, the Dialecticians made two important logical innovations, by re- examining modal logic, and by starting an important debate on the nature of conditional statements. This was the work of Diodorus Cronus and Philo the Dialectician, the only two members of the Dialectical school we have detailed information about. Through their development of propositional logic, the Dialectical school played an important role in the development of logic, which was an important precursor of Stoic logic.

Early life Laidlaw was born at Little Swinton, Berwickshire on 26 July 1875 and joined the Army in 1896. He served with the Durham Light Infantry in India where he received a certificate for his work during a plague outbreak in Bombay in 1898. In the latter year he was claimed out by his elder brother and transferred as a piper to the King's Own Scottish Borderers, in 1912 he transferred to the reserve.

First World War Laidlaw was 40 years old, and a piper in the 7th Battalion, The King's Own Scottish Borderers, 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division British Army during the Battle of Loos in September 1915 when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. Citation He received the VC from King George V at Buckingham Palace in early 1916. This was followed by two promotions, to Corporal and then Lance Sergeant by the end of 1917. In the same year, the French awarded him the Croix de Guerre, which was commonly awarded to members of allied armed forces for heroic deeds. He was demobilised in April 1919 and transferred to the Class Z Reserve later that month. Further information He later achieved the rank of sergeant-piper.

The victory checked the spread of Umayyad control westward from Narbonne into Aquitaine. Battle Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, the wali (governor) of Al-Andalus, built up a strong army from Umayyad territories to conquer Aquitaine, a large duchy in the southwest of modern-day France, formally under Frankish sovereignty, but in practice almost independent in the hands of the dukes of Aquitaine. Ian Meadows states that Al-Samh's aim was to take the Garonne River valley, capture Toulouse and open up a vast territory stretching all the way to the Atlantic and back south through Andalusia to the Mediterranean and the Maghrib.Ian Meadows, \\"The Arabs in Occitania\\", Arab and Islamic Cultures and Connections, Archive: Saudi Aramco World Al-Samh's army included siege engines, infantry, a few horsemen and a number of mercenaries, as well as Basque slingers. He besieged the city of Toulouse, then Aquitaine's most important city. Duke Odo of Aquitaine, also known as Eudes, was not in the city when it was besieged, having left to find help. He asked the assistance of Charles Martel, who in turn preferred to wait and see rather than help his southern rival. Odo returned three months later with Aquitanian, Gascon, and Frankish troops, and just as the city was about to surrender, attacked the Umayyad invasion force on June 9. The exact origin of the Frankish troops is not certain, but they may have hailed from southern Aquitanian areas, e.g., in the Lower Rhone, where naturalized Franks had settled down decades or centuries before. After Odo originally fled, the Umayyads became overconfident, and instead of maintaining strong outer defenses around their siege camp, and continuously scouting, did neither. Thus, when Odo returned, he was able to launch an assault on the siege force, both from behind and from forces within the walls. The surprised Umayyads scattered with the first attack. Odo's forces cut down those that were resting or fled without weapons or armour. Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani managed to get away with a fraction of his forces, but died shortly thereafter, leaving Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi (721-725) as governor. The number of soldiers who engaged in the battle has been grossly inflated to about 300,000 on Odo's side (Al-Maqqari), and a death-toll of 375,000 on the assaulting Umayyad troops. The figures give a rough idea of the scale of the confrontation. In a letter to Pope Gregory II, Odo said he had killed 375,000 Saracens in one day and lost 1,500 of his men. A miracle is associated with the battle according to the Liber Pontificalis: Pope Gregory II had sent Odo \\"three blessed sponges/baskets of bread\\" in 720, which the Duke kept until just before the engagement. He distributed small portions of these to be eaten by his troops at Toulouse, and after the battle, it was reported that no one who had eaten the bread had been killed or wounded.Mann, pgs. 165‚Äì166 Aftermath Arab historians agree that the Battle of Toulouse was a total disaster for the Arabs. After the defeat, some Umayyad officials and soldiers managed to escape, among them Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. However, the clash halted indefinitely the Umayyad expansion northwards. Al-Andalus was at the time re- organising into a new post-Gothic order. The Umayyads kept the military initiative raiding several times the south of Gaul (up to Autun in 725), but avoided new serious campaigns into the north-west. Odo's victory earned him widespread renown in Aquitaine and recognition abroad, he came up reinforced. He was hailed as champion of Christianity by the Pope in Rome, and was even presented with gifts. Charles steered clear of the political and military developments in the south of Gaul for another 10 years, until 732. Some authors have called the fateful engagement the Balat Al Shuhada of Toulouse; others attach that name exclusively to the Battle of Poitiers (Tours). According to Meadows, it would be still remembered in memorials by Al-Andalus Muslims for the following 450 years, as opposed to the Battle of Poitiers, held as a battle smaller in scale. Discussion Some historians believe that the Battle of Toulouse halted the Muslim conquest of Europe even more than the later‚Äîand more celebrated‚ÄîBattle of Tours (10 October 732, between Tours and Poitiers), but this is highly problematic: for even had the Arabs won at Toulouse, they still would have had to conquer the Franks to retain control of the region. However, nearly all historians agree that the Christian victory at Toulouse was important in a macrohistorical sense in that it gave Charles Martel badly needed time to strengthen his grip on power and build the veteran army which stood him in such good stead eleven years later at Tours. The eleven years between Toulouse and Tours without question gave him time to fully secure power, inspire the loyalty of his troops, and, most importantly, drill the core of veterans who stood so stoutly in 732. While Odo faded into history after his defeat at Bordeaux, the Battle of Toulouse is important as it bought time for Martel to prepare for the invasion mounted by Abd al Rahman in 732. However, others (e.g. Archibald Lewis, Roger Collins, etc.) hold that Umayyad attacks were raids or razzias, like the one reaching as far north as Autun in 725, and not real attempts to conquer Francia. While Odo is forgotten, Martel was hailed in later times as the \\"savior of Europe\\" by many Western and European authors and academic figures.

In 1862 he was described as General Manager of the International Financial Society, and was also Director of the Lands Improvement Company, through which he had been involved in reclamation and irrigation work in Spain and Majorca. With William Napier, he proposed a scheme to convey sewage from the northern outfall of Joseph Bazalgette's London sewer system some across Essex to reclaim of land from Dengie Flats, and a similar area from Maplin Sands, off the shore of Foulness Island. The estimated cost of the project was ¬£2.1 million, and although work started in 1865, a crisis in the banking system, when the Overend Gurney bank failed, made it difficult to obtain finance, and the scheme foundered.

Once in a molten state, the glass is formed by blowing and shaping with tools and hand movements. It is also known as flameworking or torchworking, as the modern practice no longer uses oil-fueled lamps. Although lack of a precise definition for lampworking makes it difficult to determine when this technique was first developed, the earliest verifiable lampworked glass is probably a collection of beads thought to date to the fifth century BC.Lierke, Rosemary, \\"Early History of Lampwork ‚Äì Some Facts, Findings, and Theories,\\" Glastech.Ber.65, 1992: p. 342. Lampworking became widely practiced in Murano, Italy in the 14th century. As early as the 17th century, itinerant glassworkers demonstrated lampworking to the public. In the mid-19th century lampwork technique was extended to the production of paperweights, primarily in France, where it became a popular art form, still collected today. Lampworking differs from glassblowing in that glassblowing uses a furnace as the primary heat source, although torches are also used. Early lampworking was done in the flame of an oil lamp, with the artist blowing air into the flame through a pipe or using foot-powered bellows. Most artists today use torches that burn either propane or natural gas, or in some countries butane, for the fuel gas, mixed with either air or pure oxygen as the oxidizer. Many hobbyists use MAPP gas in portable canisters for fuel and some use oxygen concentrators as a source of continuous oxygen. Lampworking is used to create artwork, including beads, figurines, marbles, small vessels, Christmas tree ornaments, and much more. It is also used to create scientific instruments as well as glass models of animal and botanical subjects. Glass selection Lampworking can be done with many types of glass, but the most common are soda-lime glass and lead glass, both called \\"soft glass\\", and borosilicate glass, often called \\"hard glass\\". Leaded glass tubing was commonly used in the manufacture of neon signs, and many US lampworkers used it in making blown work. Some colored glass tubing that was also used in the neon industry was used to make small colored blown work, and colored glass rod, of compatible lead and soda-lime glasses, was used to ornament both clear and colored tubing. The use of soft glass tubing has been fading due, somewhat, to environmental concerns and health risks, but mainly due to the adoption of borosilicate glass by most lampworkers, especially since colored glasses compatible with clear borosilicate were developed. Soft glass is sometimes useful because it melts at lower temperatures, however it does not react well to quick temperature changes like borosilicate glass does. Soft glass expands and contracts a lot more than hard glass when heated/cooled, and must be kept at an even temperature while working with it, especially if the piece being made has sections of varying thickness. If thin areas cool below the \\"stress point\\", shrinking can cause a crack. Hard glass, or borosilicate, shrinks much less, so is more forgiving. Borosilicate is just like regular silicate glass (SiO2), but it has a more flexible molecular structure from being doped with boron. Glasses to be fused together must be selected for compatibility with each other, both chemically (more of a concern with soft glass than borosilicate) and in terms of coefficient of thermal expansion (COE) [CTE is also used for Coefficient of Thermal Expansion.] Glasses with incompatible COE, mixed together, can create powerful stresses within a finished piece as it cools, cracking or violently shattering the piece. Chemically, some colors can react with each other when melted together. This may cause desirable effects in coloration, metallic sheen, or result in an aesthetically pleasing \\"web effect\\". It also can cause undesirable effects such as unattractive discoloration, bubbling, or devitrification. Borosilicate glass is considered more forgiving to work with, as its lower COE makes it less apt to crack during flameworking than soda-lime glass or lead glass. However, it has a narrower working temperature range than the soft glasses, has fewer available colors, and is considerably more expensive. Also, its working range is at higher temperatures than the soft glasses, requiring the use of oxygen/gas flames instead of air/gas. In addition to producing a hotter flame, the use of pure oxygen allows more control over the flame's oxidizing or reducing properties, which is necessary because some coloring chemicals in borosilicate glass react with any remaining oxygen in the flame either to produce the desired final color or to discolor if extra oxygen is present. Lead glass has the broadest working range of the three glasses, and holds its heat better when it is out of the flame. This gives one more time to adjust one's work when blowing hollow forms. It is also less likely to crack while working with it in making pieces of variable thickness than is soda-lime glass. Tools Itinerant glassworker exhibition with spinning wheel and steam engine, 1904 Tools for lampworking are similar to those used in glassblowing. Graphite is frequently used for the working surfaces of lampworking tools because of its ability to withstand high temperatures, low coefficient of friction, and resistance to sticking to the molten glass. Steel is used where greater strength is required. Some molds may be made from fruitwoods, but wood is primarily used for handles of lampworking tools. Brass may be used for working surfaces where a higher coefficient of friction is desired. *Bench Burner ‚Äì A torch that is fixed to the bench which provides a stationary flame. *Hand Torch ‚Äì The hand torch allows for more maneuverability of the flame, commonly used on glassworking lathes where there is reduced maneuverability of the piece *Kiln ‚Äì the kiln is used to garage and anneal the glass, protecting the piece from thermal shock and relieving thermal stress. *Marver ‚Äì flat surfaces used to roll glass upon in order to shape, smooth or consolidate applied decoration, typically made of graphite or steel. *Paddle ‚Äì A graphite or metal marver attached to a handle *Reamer ‚Äì A piece of graphite or brass on a handle used to enlarge holes. *Blowhose/Swivel Assembly ‚Äì A hose, usually latex, is connected to the blowpipe via a hollow swivel, allowing the lampworker to blow into hollow glass forms while rotating them. *Tungsten Pick ‚Äì The extreme temperature resistance of tungsten makes it ideal for raking(dragging glass around on the surface), or to bore a hole through the glass. *Shears ‚Äì Steel shears are used to cut the hot glass. *Claw Grabbers ‚Äì Metal tool found in various configurations which allows the hot glass to be securely held and rotated, commonly used for finishing pieces after they have been removed from the blowpipe or pontil. *Lathe ‚Äì The glassworking lathe allows for precise rotation and manipulation of glass. They are especially suited for larger scale work that may be difficult or tiring to turn by hand. General methods of beadmaking  Demonstration of the lampworking process After designing a piece, a lampworker must plan how to construct it. Once ready to begin, the lampworker slowly introduces glass rod or tubing into the flame to prevent cracking from thermal shock. The glass is heated until molten, wound around a specially coated steel mandrel, forming the base bead. The coating is an anti- fluxing bead release agent that will allow the bead to be easily removed from the mandrel, either a clay based substance or Boron nitride. It can then be embellished or decorated using a variety of techniques and materials. All parts of the workpiece must be kept at similar temperatures lest they shatter. Once finished the piece must be annealed in an kiln to prevent cracking or shattering. Annealing, in glass terms, is heating a piece until its temperature reaches a stress-relief point, that is, a temperature at which the glass is still too hard to deform, but is soft enough for internal stresses to ease. The piece is then allowed to heat-soak until its temperature is uniform throughout. The time necessary for this depends on the type of glass and thickness of the thickest section. The piece is then slowly cooled at a predetermined rate until its temperature is below a critical point, at which it can't generate internal stresses, and then can safely be dropped to room temperature. This relieves the internal stresses, resulting in a piece which should last for many years. Glass which has not been annealed may crack or shatter due to a seemingly minor temperature change or other shock. Types of glass ;Rod vs. sheet Most lampworkers use rods of glass 7‚Äì8 mm in diameter, though pre-made stringers are available in 1‚Äì3 mm sizes, or rods of 15 mm or more. Sheet glass can be cut with tools into strips, though it is easier to manipulate if attached to a rod first. Glass is also available in particles of various sizes (frit or powder), which is typically used for surface decorations in lampworked beads. Many manufacturers who once only sold their glass in sheet or very thick rod now provide rods for lampworking use. Window glass is usually not used, as it is not formulated for flameworking and there is little variation of color available. ;Soda lime glass The most popular glass for lampworking is soda-lime glass, which is available pre-colored. Soda-lime glass is the traditional mix used in blown furnace glass, and lampworking glass rods were originally hand-drawn from the furnace and allowed to cool for use by lampworkers. Today soda-lime, or \\"soft\\" glass is manufactured globally, including Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, China and America. ;Lead In addition to soda lime glass, lampworkers can use lead glass. Lead glasses are distinguished by their lower viscosity, heavier weight, and somewhat greater tolerance for COE mismatches. ;Borosilicate Lampworkers can use borosilicate glass, a very hard glass requiring greater heat. Borosilicate originated as laboratory glass, but it has recently become available in color to the studio artist from a number of companies. At one time, soft (soda lime and lead) and hard (borosilicate) glasses had distinctly different looking palettes, but demand by soft-glass artists for the silver strike colors, and the development of the bright, cadmium based \`crayon colors' by Glass Alchemy in the boro line, has diminished the distinctions between them. Basic \\"wound bead\\" technique Wound bead technique *Preparing the mandrel ‚Äì The beadmaker starts by dipping a mandrel, or wire (stainless steel welding wire, cut into lengths) into a release agent. Release agents are either clay based or man made, such as boron nitride. *Heating rod and mandrel ‚Äì The flameworker selects rods of glass to heat in the flame of the torch. When both glass and mandrel are sufficiently warm, the beadmaker starts rotating the mandrel while allowing the glass to wind upon it. *Shaping the bead ‚Äì Beads are shaped using a combination of heat, gravity and tools such as graphite paddles, mashers, tweezers, and picks. Presses to create shapes and indent patterns into the glass are also used. *Decorating the bead ‚Äì Beads can be decorated by melting stringers, or fibers of glass on the surface, creating dots or lines. With a sharp pointed tool, feathers, hearts or other designs may be produced. Metal decorations of copper, silver, gold, palladium and platinum are applied as metal leaf, wire, mesh or fuming. *Striking ‚Äì If silver based colors are used (striking colors), the bead must be heated for a few moments in the torch flame or kiln to allow crystals to reform in the glass. This temperature is slightly above the stress relief point. *Annealing ‚Äì Once completed, beads should be heated to 940¬∞-1050¬∞F (depending on glass type), until the piece reaches its \\"stress relief point\\", held at that temp for a short time, then slowly cooled to avoid thermal shock. *Cold working ‚Äì The cooled bead can be further decorated. Standard cold working techniques can be employed such as sandblasting, faceting and polishing. Etching the finished piece with acid leaves a matte finish. Additional techniques for lampworked beads Beads can be sandblasted, or they can be faceted, using lapidary techniques. \\"Furnace glass\\" beads, which are more elaborate versions of the old Seed bead technique, are widely made today. Chevron beads are multi-layer beads once exclusively made using hot-shop techniques to produce the original tubing; but now some lampworkers make similar designs on their torches before lapping the ends to reveal the various layered colors. As torches get bigger and more powerful, the cross-over between lampworking and furnace glass continues to increase. Fuming is a technique that has been developed in the past 15 years and was popularized by Bob Snodgrass. Fuming consists of heating silver or gold in the flame, so that the metals vaporize or \\"fume\\" microscopically thin layers of particles onto the glass. These particles stick to the hot glass surface changing its color with interesting effects. Silver turns clear glass into a yellowish color, giving shades of blues and greens when backed with a dark color, while gold turns clear glass shades of pinks and reds. The precious metal coating becomes increasingly visible the more the glass is fumed. Brief history of modern lampworked beads Lampworked beads (with the exception of Asian and African beadmaking) have generally been the provenance of Italian, and, later, Bohemian lampworkers for the last four hundred years or so who kept the techniques secret. Thirty or so years ago, some American artists started experimenting with the form. Their early efforts, by today's standards, were crude, as there was almost no documentation, and none of the modern tools. However, they shared their information, and some of them started small businesses developing tools, torches and other equipment. This group eventually formed the basis for the International Society of Glass Beadmakers.

He was the CEO of CBS television network from 1986 to 1995. With his brother Bob Tisch, he was part owner of Loews Corporation. Early life and career Tisch was born March 5, 1923, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Sadye and Al Tisch. His father, a former All-American basketball player at the City University of New York, owned a garment factory as well as two summer camps which his wife helped him run. He graduated from New York University when he was just 18 and received a UPenn Wharton MBA in industrial management by 20. In 1946, he made his first investment, purchasing a 300-room winter resort in Lakewood, New Jersey with $125,000 in seed money (roughly equivalent to $1.5 million at 2012 prices) from his parents.Business Insider: \\"THE TISCH DYNASTY: How Two Boys From Brooklyn Became The Biggest Name In New York\\" by Linette Lopez May 9, 2012 Two years later, his brother Bob joined him in the business, launching a lifelong partnership between the pair with Larry handling financial matters and Bob the overall management. Their first hotel was very successful and over the next decade, the Tisch brothers bought a dozen hotels in Atlantic City and the Catskills. =Career at Loews= In 1960, using the proceeds from their hotel empire, Tisch gained control of Loews Theaters, one of the largest movie house chains at the time, with Bob and Larry serving as co-chairmen of the company. They were attracted to Loews by its underlying real estate assets which they believed were undervalued. They were correct in this assumption and would later tear down many of the centrally located old theaters to build apartments and hotels reaping millions in profits. The pair soon diversified the business, successfully venturing into a variety of areas. In 1968, Loews acquired Lorillard, the 5th largest tobacco company in the United States at the time, which owned the popular brands Kent, Newport and True. In 1974, they purchased a controlling interest in the nearly bankrupt insurance company, CNA Financial Corporation. This too was very successful and several years later it held an A+ credit rating. They also purchased the Bulova Watch Company. Through acquisitions, Tisch built Loews' into a highly profitable conglomerate (with 14 hotels, 67 movie theaters, CNA Financial, Bulova, and Lorillard) with revenues increasing from $100 million in 1970 to more than $3 billion in 1980. In 2002, the year before Larry Tisch's death, the corporation had revenues of more than $17 billion and assets of more than $70 billion.USA Today: \\"Former CBS head Tisch dies at 80\\" November 15, 2003 =Career at CBS= In 1986, CBS Inc. was the target of several hostile takeover attempts by the likes of Ted Turner, Marvin Davis, and Ivan Boesky. Tisch was invited by CBS to invest in the company so as to help stop the hostile advances. Tisch spent $750 million for a 24.9% stake in CBS and a seat on the board. Later, with the support of company patriarch William S. Paley, he was named the company's president and CEO. The footstone of Laurence Tisch The Tisch era at CBS was marked by relentless cost-cutting: Tisch fired 230 out of 1,200 news employees and cut $30 million from the news division's budget. CBS divested itself of non- broadcast assets. In 1986, he sold the book publisher Holt, Rinehart and Winston to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich for $500 million; in 1987, he sold the CBS magazine division to Diamandis Communications; and also in 1987, he sold the CBS Music Group, the 2nd largest record company in the world at the time, to Sony for $2 billion. Westinghouse Electric bought CBS in 1995 for an estimated $5.4 billion, of which Tisch's ownership netted him $2 billion. Although Tisch's decade long tenure at CBS was marked by a 15% annual increase in the value of its stock, CBS remained in third place out of the big three national networks. Tisch was criticized for not understanding the broadcast business, not diversifying the business after selling its non-broadcast assets, and poor performance of CBS relative to its peers. John Gutfreund, CEO of Salomon Brothers compared him with Bill Paley, the founder of CBS: \\"Bill had a vision for the industry, for Larry, it is a business.\\" Philanthropy The grave of Laurence Tisch in Westchester Hills Cemetery Tisch made major donations to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York University, the NYU Medical Center and the Wildlife Conservation Society. A $4.5 million gift created the Tisch Children's Zoo in Central Park. From 1978 to 1998, Tisch served as chairman of the board of trustees at New York University overseeing a $1 billion capital campaign and major improvements in the university. Tisch was also a former president of the United Jewish Appeal of New York. NYU's Tisch School of the Arts is named in honor of him and his brother Bob, who donated the funds necessary to buy a building for the school. Tisch's donations also provided funding for a professorship in law, which was established in 2010 and is held by noted legal scholar Richard Epstein. There is additionally a Tisch Hall at the Stern School of Business and a Tisch Hospital at the NYU Medical Center. The professorship for history and economics in Harvard University is named after him in recognition of his philanthropy to the school. The current Laurence A.

Most of the lake is within the Berchtesgaden National Park. Description Situated within the Berchtesgaden Alps in the municipality of Sch√∂nau am K√∂nigsee, just south of Berchtesgaden and the Austrian city of Salzburg, the K√∂nigssee is Germany's third deepest lake. Located at a Jurassic rift, it was formed by glaciers during the last ice age. It stretches about in a north-south direction and is about across at its widest point. Except at its outlet, the K√∂nigsseer Ache at the village of K√∂nigssee, the lake is similar to a fjord, being surrounded by the steeply-rising flanks of mountains up to , including the Watzmann massif in the west. The literal translation of the name, K√∂nigssee, appears to be \\"king's lake\\"; however while does indeed mean \\"king\\", there had been no Bavarian kings since the days of Louis the German until Elector Maximilian I Joseph assumed the royal title in 1806. Therefore, the name more probably stems from the first name Kuno of local nobles, who appear in several historical sources referring to the donation of the Berchtesgaden Provostry in the twelfth century; the lake was formerly called Kunigsee. The K√∂nigssee Railway (K√∂nigsseebahn) served the lake from 1909 until 1965. Its last tracks were dismantled during 1971, and the former station of the K√∂nigssee Railway in Berchtesgaden (K√∂nigsseer Bahnhof) was demolished in 2012. The only remaining element of the railway is the K√∂nigsee station, which is now a restaurant. The track route is mostly used as a walking path. In 1944 a sub-camp of the Dachau concentration camp was located near where Heinrich Himmler had a residence built at Sch√∂nau for his mistress Hedwig Potthast. The lake is noted for its clear water and is advertised as the cleanest lake in Germany. For this reason, only electric-powered passenger ships, rowing, and pedal boats have been permitted on the lake since 1909. Passenger services along the length of the lake are operated by the Bayerische Seenschifffahrt company and call at Seel√§nde (Sch√∂nau), St. Bartholom√§, Salet (mid-April to mid-October), and Kessel (on request). In ideal conditions, the longest tour takes two hours from Seel√§nde to Salet. Swimming is permitted except in the lock area at Seel√§nde. Due to its picturesque setting, the lake and surrounding parklands are very popular with tourists and hikers. In addition, the surrounding sheer rock walls create an echo known for its clarity. On boat tours, it has become traditional to stop and play a flugelhorn or trumpet to demonstrate the echo. Previously demonstrated by shooting a cannon, the echo can be heard to reverberate up to seven times. The trumpeter plays along with the echo, so that there can seem to be as many as seven players. St. Bartholom√§, a famous pilgrimage church with an inn nearby, is located on a peninsula about halfway down the western lake shore. The small Christlieger island is located near its northern end. South of the K√∂nigssee, separated by the Salet moraine, is the smaller Obersee lake with the high R√∂thbach waterfall. Because there is no lakeside path on the steep shore of the K√∂nigssee, St. Bartholom√§ and the southern edge can only be reached by boat, or via hiking trails up the surrounding mountains, except during harsh winters when the lake freezes over. Stepping on the ice, however, can be fatal, as it was for a motorist who drowned in his Volkswagen Beetle on the way back from St. Bartholom√§ in January 1964. The car was found only in 1997 at a depth of about .

Individuals in a variety of contexts and with varied professional credentials engage in technical communication. Some individuals are designated as technical communicators or technical writers. These individuals use a set of methods to research, document, and present technical processes or products. Technical communicators may put the information they capture into paper documents, web pages, computer-based training, digitally stored text, audio, video, and other media. The Society for Technical Communication defines the field as any form of communication that focuses on technical or specialized topics, communicates specifically by using technology or provides instructions on how to do something.Defining Technical Communication at the STC official website.

Whatever the definition of technical communication, the overarching goal of the practice is to create easily accessible information for a specific audience.What is Technical Communication? at the official website of the Technical Communicators Association of New Zealand. Accessed February 28, 2013. As a profession Technical communicators generally tailor information to a specific audience, which may be subject matter experts, consumers, end users, etc. Technical communicators often work collaboratively to create deliverables that include online help, user manuals, classroom training guides, computer-based training, white papers, specifications, industrial videos, reference cards, data sheets, journal articles, and patents. Technical domains can be of any kind, including the soft and hard sciences, high technology including computers and software and consumer electronics. Technical communicators often work with a range of specific Subject-matter experts (SMEs) on these educational projects. Technical communication jobs include the following: API writer, e-learning author, information architect, technical content developer, technical editor, technical illustrator, technical trainer, technical translator, technical writer, usability expert, user experience designer, and user interface designer. Other jobs available to technical communicators include digital strategist, marketing specialist, and content manager. In 2015, the European Association for Technical Communication published a competence framework for the professional field of technical communication.Competence Framework for Technical Communication at the tekom Europe official website. Last updated October 2015. Accessed October 8, 2015. Much like technology and the world economy, technical communication as a profession has evolved over the last half-century. In a nutshell, technical communicators take the physiological research of a project and apply it to the communication process itself. Content creation Technical communication is a task performed by specialized employees or consultants. For example, a professional writer may work with a company to produce a user manual. Some companies give considerable technical communication responsibility to other technical professionals‚Äîsuch as programmers, engineers, and scientists. Often, a professional technical writer edits such work to bring it up to modern technical communication standards. To begin the documentation process, technical communicators identify the audience and their information needs. The technical communicator researches and structures the content into a framework that can guide detailed development. As the body of information comes together, the technical communicator ensures that the intended audience can understand the content and retrieve the information they need. This process, known as the writing process, has been a central focus of writing theory since the 1970s, and some contemporary textbook authors apply it to technical communication. Technical communication is important to most professions, as a way to contain and organize information and maintain accuracy. The technical writing process is based on Cicero's 5 canons of rhetoric, and can be divided into six steps: # Determine purpose and audience # Collect information (Invention) # Organize and outline information (Arrangement) # Write the first draft (Style) # Revise and edit (Memory) # Publish output (Delivery) =Determining purpose and audience= All technical communication serves a particular purpose‚Äîtypically to communicate ideas and concepts to an audience, or instruct an audience in a particular task. Technical communication professionals use various techniques to understand the audience and, when possible, test content on the target audience. For example, if bank workers don't properly post deposits, a technical communicator would review existing instructional material (or lack thereof), interview bank workers to identify conceptual errors, interview subject matter experts to learn the correct procedures, author new material that instructs workers in the correct procedures, and test the new material on the bank workers. Similarly, a sales manager who wonders which of two sites is better for a new store might ask a marketing professional to study the sites and write a report with recommendations. The marketing professional hands the report off to a technical communicator (in this case, a technical editor or technical writer), who edits, formats, and sometimes elaborates the document in order to make the marketing professional's expert assessment usable to the sales manager. The process is not one of knowledge transfer, but the accommodation of knowledge across fields of expertise and contexts of use. This is the basic definition of technical communication. Audience type affects many aspects of communication, from word selection and graphics use to style and organization. Most often, to address a particular audience, a technical communicator must consider what qualities make a text useful (capable of supporting a meaningful task) and usable (capable of being used in service of that task). A non- technical audience might misunderstand or not even read a document that is heavy with jargon‚Äîwhile a technical audience might crave detail critical to their work such as vector notation. Busy audiences often don't have time to read entire documents, so content must be organized for ease of searching‚Äîfor example by frequent headings, white space, and other cues that guide attention. Other requirements vary according to particular audience's needs. Technical communication in the government is particular and detailed. Depending on the segment of government (and country), the government component must follow distinct specifications. Information changes continuously and technical communications (technical manuals, interactive electronic technical manuals, technical bulletins, etc.) must be updated. =Collecting information= Technical communicators must collect all information that each document requires. They may collect information through primary (first-hand) research‚Äîor secondary research, using information from existing work by other authors. Technical communicators must acknowledge all sources they use to produce their work. To this end, technical communicators typically distinguish quotations, paraphrases, and summaries when taking notes. =Organizing and outlining information= Before writing the initial draft, the technical communicator organizes ideas in a way that makes the document flow well. Once each idea is organized, the writer organizes the document as a whole‚Äîaccomplishing this task in various ways: * chronological: used for documents that involve a linear process, such as a step-by-step guide that describes how to accomplish something; * parts of an object: Used for documents that describe the parts of an object, such as a graphic showing the parts of a computer (keyboard, monitor, mouse, etc.); * simple to complex (or vice versa): starts with easy ideas and gradually goes into complex ideas; * specific to general: starts with many ideas, then organizes the ideas into sub-categories; * general to specific: starts with a few categories of ideas, then goes deeper. After organizing the whole document, the writer typically creates a final outline that shows the document structure. Outlines make the writing process easier and save the author time. =Writing the first draft= After the outline is complete, the writer begins the first draft, following the outline's structure. Setting aside blocks of an hour or more, in a place free of distractions, helps the writer maintain a flow. Most writers prefer to wait until the draft is complete before any revising so they don't break their flow. Typically, the writer should start with the easiest section, and write the summary only after the body is drafted. The ABC (abstract, body, and conclusion) format can be used when writing a first draft of some document types. The abstract describes the subject, so that the reader knows what the document covers. The body is the majority of the document and covers topics in depth. Lastly, the conclusion section restates the document's main topics. The ABC format can also apply to individual paragraphs‚Äîbeginning with a topic sentence that states the paragraph's topic, followed by the topic, and finally, a concluding sentence. =Revising and editing= Once the initial draft is laid out, editing and revising can be done to fine-tune the draft into a final copy. Four tasks transform the early draft into its final form, suggested by Pfeiffer and Boogard: Adjusting and reorganizing content In this step, the writer revises the draft to elaborate on topics that need more attention, shorten other sections‚Äîand relocate certain paragraphs, sentences, or entire topics. Editing for style Good style makes writing more interesting, appealing, and readable. In general, the personal writing style of the writer is not evident in technical writing. Modern technical writing style relies on attributes that contribute to clarity: headings, lists, graphics; generous white space, short sentences, present tense, simple nouns, active voiceGary Blake and Robert W. Bly, The Elements of Technical Writing, pg. 63. New York: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. (though some scientific applications still use the passive voice), second and third person as required Technical writing as a discipline usually requires that a technical writer use a style guide. These guides may relate to a specific project, product, company, or brand. They ensure that technical writing reflects formatting, punctuation, and general stylistic standards that the audience expects. In the United States, many consider the Chicago Manual of Style the bible for general technical communication. Other style guides have their adherents, particularly for specific industries‚Äîsuch as the Microsoft Style Guide in some information technology settings. Editing for grammar and punctuation At this point, the writer performs a mechanical edit, checking the document for grammar, punctuation, common word confusions, passive voice, overly long sentences, etc. See also * Technical definition * Technical editing * Technical writing References Writing occupations Mass media occupations ","title":"Technical communication"},{"id":"1219407","text":"Major Roland Edward Elcock VC MM (5 June 1899 ‚Äì 6 October 1944) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Elcock was born on 5 June 1899. He initially enlisted in the British Army in October 1914 when he was 15. Being underage for army service, he was discharged when his real age was discovered. He worked as a clerk in Wolverhampton before re-enlisting at the age of 18. He was 19 years old, and an acting corporal in the 11th Battalion, The Royal Scots (The Lothian Regiment), British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his actions on 15 October 1918 south-east of Capelle St. Catherine, France. Corporal Elcock was in charge of a Lewis gun team, and entirely on his own initiative he rushed his gun up to within 10 yards of enemy guns which were causing heavy casualties and holding up the advance. He put both guns out of action, capturing five prisoners and undoubtedly saved the whole attack from being held up.

History The land was a land grant to the University of North Carolina by the State of North Carolina. The land encompassed , and was sold for five shillings on October 21, 1776. The cemetery currently covers . The first recorded burial was George Clarke, a Burke County student at the university, who died September 28, 1798. His headstone was not placed until several years later. By January 28, 1994, 1,621 burials had been performed. The cemetery is now almost full, and all of the plots have already been bought. In 1922, the town took over responsibility for maintaining the cemetery, and in 1988, the ownership changed over to the University. A low rock wall was built around the cemetery in 1835 at the cost of $64.41. The school officially named the cemetery \\"College Graveyard,\\" as opposed to \\"Village Cemetery,\\" like the Chapel Hill residents called it. Five sidewalks divide the cemetery into six sections. Two of the sections were reserved for African-American burials because there were no black church cemeteries in town. A low rock wall divides the two segregated sections (Sections A and B) from the rest. The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies were the first to establish plots. In the other sections, there are administrators and professors, as well as prominent public officials, business leaders, and artists from the area. During the Civil War, Confederate soldiers were buried there. Headstones, flat plaques, gated plots and other accommodations There are many different styles of grave markers represented in the cemetery. Many of the early family plots are marked by monuments and obelisks with smaller tablets marking individual graves. There are also uninscribed fieldstones, headstones, ledgers, boxtombs, and tomb-tables in the newer sections. Marble and granite were used most frequently, but stone and concrete can also be found. The Old Chapel Hill Cemetery is not just a resting place for the deceased. It remains an integral part of campus life. For many students, the quiet, secluded setting is an ideal place to relax or study. Diverse species of trees, such as oaks, hickories, gums, cedars, maples, and pines, create a cover of shade in the cemetery. There are also shrubs, like boxwoods, azaleas, nandinas, and crape myrtles, around many of the plots. During the spring, dogwood trees, azaleas and wisteria make the cemetery one of the most beautiful spots on campus. Some of the individual gravestones are covered by English ivy and vinca. A gazebo has been built between Section B and Section 1 and provides a convenient place to sit. Vandalism has been a major problem in the cemetery. Whether the culprits are just careless or actually meaning to cause damage, the cemetery has had many tombstones ruined throughout the years. Five 19th century headstones were tipped over and smashed the day before Charles Kuralt was buried in the cemetery. On November 27, 1974, 40 to 50 monuments were broken and pushed off their bases. In 1985, football fans eager to get to a seat damaged stones. Distinguished persons buried in the cemetery include legendary North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith, band leader Kay Kyser, playwright Paul Green, novelists Alice Adams and Max Steele, university president Frank Porter Graham, university president Robert Burton House, university system president William Friday, and CBS newsman Charles Kuralt. There is also a plot set aside for the Friday family, whose daughter was buried around 2003. In 2005, the Memorial Grove portion was established to allow space for the spreading of ashes of cremated persons. Names of those whose ashes have been spread in the grove are inscribed upon the Wall of Remembrance. To date, the names of fifteen persons are inscribed on the wall. Some of these persons had been cremated before the opening of the grove. It is assumed that their ashes were originally retained in the care of loved ones.

Moore and Slatten traced the suggestion that his wife was a Poythress back to a comment by W. G.

Moore and Slatten state: \\"Interestingly, Thomas Rolfe here is recorded as married to a 'Miss Payers'. We recall that in John Rolfe's will the name of his third wife is spelt Pyers (Peirce) and that it was John who married a \\"Jane\\". Here again a Bolling descendant confused the son with his father. Not recognizing the name 'Payers' as another variant of Peirce, someone searched the records for a name beginning with 'P' and having a 'y' in the first syllable. Francis Poythress lived in adjacent Charles City County and his name ended in s! Stanard wrote, 'His wife is said to have been a Miss Poythress (if so, doubtless a daughter of Francis Poythress).' (VMHB I, 446) Wyndham Robertson, a Bolling descendant, wrote in Pocahontas Alias Mataoke and Her Descendants (Richmond, 1887), 'I adopt \\"Jane Poythress\\" (not \\"Poyers\\") whom he is stated in the Bolling Memoirs to have married in England.' He added in justification of his charming adoption of an ancestress, '...no such name as \\"Poyers\\" is anywhere known ... the family of Poythress was already settled in Virginia.' ... The result has been the acceptance of a non-existent personage, 'Jane Poythress', in the Bibles of Virginia genealogy, as the bona fide ancestress of many illustrious Virginians. Who the wife (or wives) of Thomas Rolfe may have been remains an unanswered question.\\" Thomas Rolfe was the son of John Rolfe and his wife, Pocahontas.

Adaptor proteins contain a variety of protein-binding modules that link protein-binding partners together and facilitate the creation of larger signaling complexes. These proteins tend to lack any intrinsic enzymatic activity themselves, instead mediating specific protein‚Äìprotein interactions that drive the formation of protein complexes. Examples of adaptor proteins include MYD88, Grb2 and SHC1. Signaling components Much of the specificity of signal transduction depends on the recruitment of several signalling components such as protein kinases and G-protein GTPases into short-lived active complexes in response to an activating signal such as a growth factor binding to its receptor. Domains Adaptor proteins usually contain several domains within their structure (e.g., Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains) that allow specific interactions with several other specific proteins. SH2 domains recognise specific amino acid sequences within proteins containing phosphotyrosine residues and SH3 domains recognise proline-rich sequences within specific peptide sequence contexts of proteins. There are many other types of interaction domains found within adaptor and other signalling proteins that allow a rich diversity of specific and coordinated protein‚Äìprotein interactions to occur within the cell during signal transduction.

He was involved with and invested in the oil industry via academic, government and commercial endeavors. He owned 16% of Koch Industries. Marshall was married to model and celebrity Anna Nicole Smith during the last 14 months of his life. His estate became the subject of protracted litigation, which was reviewed by the Supreme Court in Marshall v. Marshall and Stern v. Marshall. Early years Born in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, J. Howard Marshall II attended George School, a private high school in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and then studied liberal arts at Haverford College, both Quaker institutions, graduating in 1926. While at George School and Haverford he edited the school newspapers, captained the debate teams and was an All American soccer player and played competitive tennis under the instruction of professional Bill Tilden. He graduated magna cum laude from Yale Law School in 1931. At Yale, he was case editor of the Yale Law Journal and studied with the law and economics pioneer Walton Hale Hamilton. Careers Upon graduation, he served from 1931 to 1933 as an Assistant Dean at Yale Law School and instructed courses in business, finance and procedure. At the same time, he was producing scholarship as a member of the influential legal realism school of thought, working with future Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas on an article entitled A Factual Study of Bankruptcy Administration and Some Suggestions, published in 1932. However, his most influential works, done with Norman Meyers, were two articles entitled Legal Planning of Petroleum Production. These pioneering studies offered an alternative to the then-prevailing practices of controlled production in the petroleum industry, which were leading to dramatic boom/bust cycles. They gained the interest of the government, especially since the legal minds behind the New Deal were staunch supporters of legal realism. In 1933, he left Yale to become the Assistant Solicitor at the Department of the Interior under Harold L. Ickes. During his first tour at Interior, he authored the Code of Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry (1933), and the Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935 in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). Specifically, it revived the portion of the original legislation that regulated the flow of oil between states. Ostensibly enacted to protect the industry from \\"contraband oil\\" in order to stabilize falling prices. In 1935, he left government service to become the special counsel to the president (Kenneth R. Kingsbury) of Standard Oil of California (now Chevron Corporation) in San Francisco, and began his long career as an oilman. Another two years later he became a partner at the firm Pillsbury Madison Sutro (now known as Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman), which was the company's outside counsel. It was at Standard Oil of California that he began a lifelong business association and friendship with his mentor Ralph K. Davies. In 1941, he was called back to Washington, D.C. during World War II as Solicitor of the Petroleum Administration for War, helping develop U.S. energy policy during the war, including the Cole Pipeline Act of 1941, and later as a member of the Committee on Reparations, the National Petroleum Council and the American Petroleum Institute. In 1944, after developing a relationship with Paul G. Blazer, he became Vice Chairman and President of Ashland Oil and Refining Co. (now Ashland Inc.).Otto J. Scott, The Exception: The History of Ashland Oil, McGraw Hill, 1968 Later positions included Executive Vice President at Signal Oil & Gas under Samuel B. Mosher (1952), President of Union Texas Petroleum (1960) and Executive Vice President of Allied Signal (all now Honeywell) (1967), Union Texas Petroleum Holdings was later sold by Allied Signal to ARCO and merged into BP, until his semi-retirement in 1969. Marshall remained active in the energy industry through many personal endeavors with Great Northern Oil Company, Koch Industries, Coastal Corporation (now El Paso Corporation), Independent Refinery, International Oil and Gas, various exploration syndicates and culminating in 1984, when he founded Marshall Petroleum. Throughout many of his endeavors, Marshall turned most of his business associations into friendships; including J.R. Parten, Fred C. Koch and his sons, Oscar Wyatt and E.O. Buck. Koch Industries Marshall turned his investment in Great Northern Oil Co. with Fred Koch during the 1950s into a 16% stake in Koch Industries, now America's second largest privately held company. When his eldest son J. Howard Marshall III sided with Bill Koch, Frederick R. Koch and other collateral family members in a failed attempt to take over Koch Industries from Charles Koch and David Koch, he purchased back company stock given previously as a gift and removed the eldest son from his estate plan. Conversely, during the same dispute, his youngest son E. Pierce Marshall sided with his father, Charles Koch and David Koch. Marriages Marshall married Eleanor Pierce in 1931 and divorced in 1961. They had two sons together: J. Howard Marshall III (born February 6, 1936) and E. Pierce Marshall (January 12, 1939 ‚Äì June 20, 2006). His second marriage, to Bettye Bohannon, lasted from 1961 until her death in 1991. In 1994, at the age of 89, he married 26-year-old model Anna Nicole Smith. Their marriage lasted 14 months, until his death. Death and ensuing lawsuits Marshall died of Pneumonia at the age of 90 in Houston, Texas on August 4, 1995. Following Marshall's death, Anna Nicole Smith (who died on February 8, 2007) became involved in a court battle with her former stepson, E. Pierce Marshall (who died on June 20, 2006). J. Howard's will and trust did not include Anna Nicole or J. Howard's other son, J. Howard Marshall III. The legal dispute worked its way through both state and federal courts as Anna Nicole and J. Howard III sought to overturn the will and trust. In 2001, they both lost their cases during a six- month Texas state court jury trial, upholding Marshall's will and trust.Marshall v. MacIntyre (In re Estate of Marshall), prob. juris. noted, no. 276,815-402 (2001) During the probate proceedings, Smith declared bankruptcy in California and was awarded $474 million as a sanction for alleged misconduct.Marshall v. Marshall (In re Marshall), 253 B.R. 550 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 2000) In 2002, the bankruptcy judgment was vacated and her award was reduced to $88 million in a Federal District Court in California.Marshall v. Marshall, 275 B.R. 5 (C.D. Cal. 2002) In December 2004, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court decision under the probate exception, ruling that the federal courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over state probate matters. The Ninth Circuit decision also affirmed the primacy of Texas Probate decision which determined that no misconduct had taken place and that Smith was not one of J. Howard Marshall's heirs.Marshall v. Marshall, 392 F. 3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2004) However, on May 1, 2006, the Supreme Court in Marshall v. Marshall reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision regarding the probate exception, allowing Smith another opportunity to pursue her claims in federal court. The case was remanded to the Ninth Circuit for adjudication of the remaining appellate issues.Marshall v. Marshall, 547 U.S. 293 (2006) On June 25, 2009, the same three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard oral arguments on the remaining appellate issues. On March 19, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its second opinion on remand, finding in favor of E. Pierce Marshall, that the California Bankruptcy Court did not have jurisdiction and the California Federal District Court was precluded from reviewing matters already decided in the Texas Probate Court. On September 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court again agreed to hear the case. On June 23, 2011, the United States Supreme court decided the case in a 5-4 decision in favor of the Marshall family (now styled Stern v. Marshall 10-179). The majority of the Court decided Congress cannot constitutionally authorize non-Article III bankruptcy judges final order jurisdiction on state law based counterclaims to proofs of claim which are not necessary to resolve the claim itself. Marshall's eldest son not only lost his case in Texas probate court but also lost a counterclaim against him for fraud with malice. The jury originally awarded E. Pierce Marshall $35 million in damages but the probate court reduced that amount to $10 million. J. Howard Marshall III then filed for bankruptcy in California and was discharged by the same bankruptcy judge that had administered Smith's bankruptcy. This decision was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

He joined the Protestant Bohemian Revolt in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown against the House of Habsburg that led to Thirty Years' War. Following the victory of Catholic forces in the Battle of White Mountain, Harant was executed in the mass Old Town Square execution by the Habsburgs. As a composer he represented the school of Franco-Flemish polyphony in Bohemia. Harant is also noted for his expedition to the Middle East summarized in a travel book Journey from Bohemia to the Holy Land, by way of Venice and the Sea and published in 1608.  Life  Harant was born at Klenov√° Castle, near Klatovy, Bohemia. From 1576 he studied singing and counterpoint as a member of a local court band at Innsbruck, at the court of Archduke Ferdinand II, learning 7 languages, discovering his talent for music and the other arts and his interest in history, geography and political science. He returned to Bohemia in 1584 in a vain attempt to get a post at the court of Rudolf II, and so enlisted as a soldier, participating in the 1593 and 1597 campaign against the Turks. In 1589 he married Eva Czernin von Chudenitz - they had two children before she died in 1597. Kry≈°tof married two more times. Leaving his relation Lidmila Markvartov√° z Hr√°dku to raise the children, in 1598 and 1599 he went to the Holy Land as a pilgrim, wishing to visit the Holy Sepulchre with Eva's brother Hermann. He wrote about his experiences in a book entitled Journey from Bohemia to the Holy Land, by way of Venice and the Sea which was published in Prague in 1608. After his return, in 1599, he was given a post in the emperor's court and simultaneously raised to the peerage, though both his children died that year. In 1601 he was made an advisor to the court of Rudolf and his successor Matthias and part of the imperial chambers. When the imperial court moved to Vienna, Harant was granted the Pecka Castle and dedicated himself for some years to music, becoming the most important Bohemian composer of the time. During 1614-15 he travelled to Spain with a diplomatic mission. Old Town Square execution of 27 members of the Czech nobility by the Habsburgs In 1618 he converted to Protestantism, returned to Prague, joined the forces arrayed against the Catholics as an artillery officer and fought on the side of the Bohemian states during the uprisings. In 1619 he became the commissioner of the military unit of Boleslav, Kou≈ôim and Hradec Kr√°lov√©, and was involved in a 50,000 strong regiment in the unsuccessful march on imperial Vienna. During the rebellion he bombarded the imperial palace in Vienna--with the emperor inside--which proved to be a bad move. After Friedrich V succeeded to the Palatinate, he was appointed as a privy councillor and president of the Bohemian chamber, though this career was short-lived. After the defeat of the Protestant Czechs at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 by the combined arms of Maximilian and Tilly, the subsequent sack of Prague by Imperial troops, and the assumption of office by the Emperor Ferdinand II, Harant withdrew to his castle. He was captured there by Albrecht Wenzel Eusebius von Waldstein, arrested and taken to Prague, unsuccessfully pleading for mercy. As one of the twenty-seven Bohemian noble rebels, he was condemned to death and beheaded on 21 June 1621 by Jan Mydl√°≈ô in the Old Town Square, Prague, along with all the other leaders of the insurrection. His widow Anna Salomena (born von Horschitz, who had married Kry≈°tof) in 1625 married Hermann Czernin von Chudenitz, Eva's brother.  Music and influence  Harant's music was conservative, and in the style of the Netherlands composers of the previous generation. He used archaic techniques such as cantus firmus mass composition. Seven separate works survived, all sacred vocal compositions (the rest were lost when his property was confiscated as being that of an executed traitor). One of his pieces is a cantus firmus mass based on a madrigal by Marenzio (Missa quinis vocibus super Dolorosi martir)‚Äîa musical irony in that it combines a technique which went out of fashion a hundred years before with the music of one of Italy's most popular and progressive composers. Harant had a reputation as a fine instrumentalist and singer in addition to being a composer. In another irony, one of his Roman Catholic masses was performed in 1620, just before his execution, in a Catholic church in Prague, to great ceremony. Musical works * Missa quinis vocibus super Dolorosi martir - to the theme of madrigal by L. Marenzio \\"Dolorosi martir, fieri tormenti\\".

The film was directed by Tony Bill, written by Monte Merrick and Stephen Sommers, and produced by Walt Disney Television. It stars Richard Dreyfuss, Elijah Wood, David O'Hara, and Alex Trench as the titular character. As in most film adaptations of this novel, Monks, Oliver's half-brother, is not in the film. There are other changes as well. The bookseller does not testify for Oliver at his trial, but Rose Maylie does. Most of the changes are minor, but a major one is that when Oliver is taken in by Fagin's gang he himself, and not the Widow Corney, is in possession of his mother's locket, and Oliver has come to London, not just to seek his fortune, but to discover his true identity. Mr. Bumble, Corney's assistant, is only in one scene, and the Widow Corney's role is expanded. And, as in the musical and the 1968 film Oliver!, Nancy is murdered at London Bridge, not in her bedroom as in the novel. Oliver Twist premiered on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney on November 16, 1997. Plot A woman gives birth to a boy in an orphanage owned by the Widow Corney, dying as she does so. She leaves him a locket, containing a portrait of her mother, which Corney takes. Her assistant names the child Oliver Twist from his rotating alphabetical list of names. Six years later, Oliver, now working in the orphanage, requests to see his locket. Corney says he can have it when he‚Äôs twelve. Six years later, Oliver is forced on the night before his 12th birthday into drawing straws at dinner for who has to ask Corney for more food. After drawing the shortest one, she throws him out of the workhouse for daring to ask her such a question without his locket. He returns to steal it at night and heads out to London. Oliver has a dream with Dodger Once there, Oliver, hungry, is stopped from stealing an apple by a young man named Jack Dawkins, also known as the Artful Dodger, who explains that he‚Äôs a professional thief and proud of his work. He offers to take Oliver in with the band of boys he lives with and his boss, Fagin, an old and sly man who teaches the group how to steal. Upon arriving, Fagin takes Oliver's locket as Oliver is dressed and welcomed. Oliver also meets Bill Sikes-a thief and murderer to whom Fagin owes an enormous sum-and his kind girlfriend, Nancy. Dodger begins to teach Oliver about the art of thievery that same day. At night, Oliver catches Fagin admiring his treasure which he keeps hidden in a box and is threatened with death if he steals from it. However, when asked, Fagin admits that it is where he is keeping Oliver's locket. Three months later, Oliver is sent out to pick his first pocket as Dodger orchestrates the plan. While stealing a watch, Oliver is caught red-handed. Thinking quickly, Dodger grabs the watch instead and runs off with Oliver, but he escapes while Oliver is mistakenly identified as the thief. Dodger quietly hurries to court to try to rescue him, where Mr. Brownlow (the victim)'s niece, Rose, has testified for Oliver that he was not the boy, and Oliver refused to name the culprit. Rose offers Oliver to be a guest at their mansion in Grosvenor Square. There, he sees a portrait on the wall of the same lady his locket contains. When told it is Mr. Brownlow's late wife, and that they had one daughter who always carried a gold locket with that portrait, he and Rose realize that it means he may be Mr. Brownlow's grandson and her cousin. Meanwhile, Dodger manages to locate Oliver. Deciding that he knows too much about the group to be left on his own, Sikes convinces Fagin to let him kidnap Oliver with Dodger and Nancy's help. However, Nancy does so unwillingly, and Dodger refuses to put Oliver in the bag intended to be used for his abduction. Back at the hideout, Oliver confirms that he let nothing slip about the group, but tells Nancy that he loved the Brownlows. Nancy tries to return Oliver to the mansion, but is seen in the street by Sikes and forced to go back. Suspicious, Sikes hires Dodger to follow her the next day. Sikes later weasels out of Oliver that he knows where Fagin's treasure is kept. At night, he forces him to go to the Brownlow's to steal at gunpoint. Inside, Oliver purposely drops the bag of silver he's holding to wake Rose. Sikes and Oliver escape, but Mr. Brownlow sees Oliver, confirming his suspicion that he is a thief. Dodger encourages Oliver to escape if he gets the chance. The next day, Nancy goes to the Brownlows unknowingly followed by Dodger. She tells them of Oliver's abduction and agrees to return him at London Bridge at midnight. Dodger, threatened by Sikes, admits of overhearing the agreement. Still wanting Oliver to be free, he takes him to the bridge himself to throw Sikes off the trail. Unfortunately, Nancy, unaware of Dodger's plan, is murdered there by a furious Sikes who accuses her of double-crossing him. Meanwhile, Oliver has gone back to the hideout to retrieve his locket. Sikes walks in the door and sees the treasure. As he attempts to flee with it himself, Fagin arrives, followed by Dodger who stops Sikes, furious at Nancy's murder. Nancy's dead body has been found, and the police follow Sikes's dog to the hideout. Sikes locks the door, takes the box and Oliver (as a hostage) up to the roof, and leaves Dodger and Fagin below. On the roof, Oliver grabs the box from Sikes, who turns on him and slips. His neck gets caught in a coil of rope, and he is hung by the noose on the spot as the police watch. Dodger is arrested by them for his pilfering, and while Fagin negotiates with Oliver for the locket, ultimately returns it. The locket finally proves that Oliver is in fact Mr. Brownlow‚Äôs grandson by the matching of the portraits. After bidding a fond farewell to the arrested Dodger promising to see him again someday, Oliver is last seen sleeping happily in his new home.

That is why I would like that this book may not be used under [any] circumstances as a strategic or chronological reference.\\" After reading Sajer's latest letter, one of his staunchest critics‚ÄîGro√üdeutschland Veteran's Association leader Helmuth Spaeter‚Äîrecanted his original suspicions of Sajer, noting \\"I have underestimated Herr Sajer and my respect for him has greatly increased.\\" The British writer Alan Clark, author of Barbarossa: The Russian-German Conflict 1941‚Äì45, refers to Sajer's book in his Diaries as a book \\"to which AC [Alan Clark] often turned\\".Diaries by Alan Clark (1993) The book was considered by the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College to be an accurate roman √† clef and has remained on its recommended reading list for World War II, along with other historical novels. It is also on the recommended reading list of the Commandant of the United States Marines Corps.HISTORICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY No. 8 Military Classics Reviews and critical commentary The book was reviewed in The New York Times by J. Glenn Gray in 1971. He reports the \\"book is painful to get through. But it is also difficult to put down and is worth the cost in horror that reading it entails.\\" Other reviews from 1971 include The New Yorker, Time magazine, and The New Republic by James Walt. Walt says the book is not anti-war but an accounting of those soldiers caught up in events bigger than themselves. Other more recent English reviewers include James Varner in Military Review in 2009. Jason S. Ridler in \\"War in the Precious Graveyard: Death through the Eyes of Guy Sajer\\", from the journal War, Literature, and the Arts suggests that Sajer idealized death in battle, and Sajer's reactions to corpses in the book reveals survivor guilt. Criticism The accuracy and authenticity of the book have been disputed by some historians. Some of the details Sajer mentions appear to be incorrect, while other are impossible to verify due to the lack of surviving witnesses and documents. The most frequently cited inaccuracy is Sajer's statement that, after being awarded the coveted Grossdeutschland Division cuff title, he and a friend were ordered to sew it on their left sleeves, when it was actually sewn on the right sleeve. Edwin Kennedy wrote that this error was \\"unimaginable\\" for a former member of such an elite German unit. Sajer also discusses campaign locations in vague terms and never with specific dates. For example, he asserts that during the summer of 1942 he was briefly assigned to a Luftwaffe training unit in Chemnitz commanded by famed Stuka ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel, but according to Rudel himself, his training unit was actually in Graz, Austria, during the whole of 1942. Sajer mentions seeing \\"the formidable Focke-Wulf [...] 195s, which could soar up quickly,\\"Sajer, 1965, p. 96 taking off from an airfield outside Berlin, when no such aircraft ever existed (a Focke-Wulf projekt 195, a heavy transport, was in the pipeline, but never got off the drawing boardhttp://www.the- blueprints.com/blueprints/ww2planes/fockewulf/1363/view/focke- wulf_projekt_195/). Finally, the names of most of Sajer's companions and leaders do not appear on official rolls in the Bundesarchiv, nor are they known to the Grossdeutschland Veterans Association, whose leader, Helmuth Spaeter, was one of the first to question whether Sajer actually served in the Grossdeutschland Division as he claimed. However, some authors and other Gro√üdeutschland veterans have testified to the book's historical plausibility, even if they cannot speak to the specific events in the book. Lieutenant Hans Joachim Schafmeister-Berckholtz, who served in the Grossdeutschland during the same period as Sajer, confirmed in a letter that he had read the book and considered it an accurate overall account of the Division's battles in the East, while also noting that he remembered a Landser named Sajer in his Panzergrenadier company (5th co), the same company number Sajer mentions being assigned to (though there was more than one \\"5th Company\\" in the Division). Sajer himself struck back against implications of fraud or fiction by claiming that The Forgotten Soldier was intended as a personal narrative, based on his best personal recollections of an intensely chaotic period in German military history, and not an attempt at a serious historical study of World War II: \\"You ask me questions of chronology, situations, dates, and unimportant details. Historians and archivists have harassed me for a long time with their rude questions. All of this is unimportant. Other authors and high-ranking officers could respond to your questions better than I. I never had the intention to write a historical reference book; rather, I wrote about my innermost emotional experiences as they relate to the events that happened to me in the context of the Second World War.\\" Sajer further stressed the non- technical and anecdotal nature of his book in a 1997 letter to US Army historian Douglas Nash: \\"Apart from the emotions I brought out, I confess my numerous mistakes. That is why I would like that this book may not be used under [any] circumstances as a strategic or chronological reference.\\" After reading Sajer's latest letter, one of his staunchest critics, Spaeter of the Grossdeutschland Veteran's Association, recanted his original suspicions of Sajer: \\"I was deeply impressed by his statements in his letter. ... I have underestimated Herr Sajer and my respect for him has greatly increased. I am myself more of a writer who deals with facts and specifics, much less like one who writes in a literary way. For this reason, I was very skeptical towards the content of his book. I now have greater regard for Herr Sajer and I will read his book once again.\\" Film rights Dutch film director Paul Verhoeven has discussed with Sajer the possibility of turning The Forgotten Soldier into a film.\\"Interview BD:Dimitri\\" , BrusselsBDTour.com References External links *Discussion at custermen.net of the authenticity of The Forgotten Soldier Retrieved 2019 *Bibliography and sources for The Forgotten Soldier, by Jonathan Kraetsch, UC Santa Barbara *The Forgotten Soldier, at Internet Archive French autobiographical novels World War II memoirs ","title":"The Forgotten Soldier"},{"id":"1219479","text":"Major Matthew Fontaine Maury Meiklejohn VC (; 27 November 1870 - 4 July 1913Who's Who 1914, p. xxiii, gives 3 July as the date of death) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Details Meiklejohn's medals on display at the Gordon Highlanders Museum. Meiklejohn was the son of Professor John Meiklejohn, of the University of St. Andrews, and was educated at Madras College and Fettes College. He was 28 years old, and a Captain in the 2nd Battalion, The Gordon Highlanders, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place at the Battle of Elandslaagte for which he was awarded the VC. His VC action cost him his arm which was amputated. Despite this, he remained in the army as a staff officer. He was promoted to the substantive rank of Captain of the Gordon Highlanders 22 January 1902, and was seconded as a staff officer posted at Saint Helena. He later achieved the rank of major. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum along with his campaign medals. Further information Meiklejohn's grave in Brookwood Cemetery His death occurred when he was riding his horse in Hyde Park and it bolted. With only one arm to control the horse, he took the choice to steer it into some cast iron railings, in order to avoid a nursemaid who was pushing a baby in her pram. This was considered to be an act of high bravery and cost him his life. He died on 4 July 1913 and was given a hero's funeral in Brookwood Cemetery. He is commemorated by a plaque on the wall of the Hyde Park Barracks, London.

It was awarded to individuals who had \\"fought heroically for the independence of Poland,\\" and was released in three versions.  History  The Cross of Independence was established with a decree of the President of Poland of 29 October 1930. It was to be awarded to the people who laid foundations for the independence of the Fatherland before the World War or during it, as well as during the fights between 1818 and 1921, with the exception of the Polish-Russian War. After 1938 it was also awarded to people responsible for the reunification of Zaolzie with Poland. Although the cross without the swords was awarded mainly to the civilians, all versions were considered to be military decorations. If awarded to a soldier it was worn before the 4th class of the Polonia Restituta and when awarded to a civilian ‚Äì before the Volunteer Medal for the War (Medal Ochotniczy za Wojnƒô). The recipients of all grades of the Cross of Independence had a right to be elected to the Senate of the Republic of Poland, the right to travel by Polish State Railways free of charge and a right to send their children to the schools of their choice free of charge.  Design  Both the Cross and the Medal were designed by professor Mieczys≈Çaw Kotarbi≈Ñski and most of the copies were made by Warsaw-based jeweller Wiktor Gontarczyk. The Cross of Independence had three classes: # Cross of Independence with Swords (1818 awarded by 1938) # Cross of Independence (7917 awarded by 1938) # Medal of Independence (51735 awarded all together) The cross was 42 by 42 mm, made of gilt bronze. The obverse had a rectangle shield with stylised eagle in bas- relief. The reverse was covered with black enamel and the motto Bojownikom Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci (To the Fighters for Independence). The version with Swords had two golden swords crossed above the cross. Medal of Independence Medal of Independence was round, 35 mm in diameter and made entirely of bronze.

Biography He was a private in the 13th Battalion, The Durham Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. In thick mist, an officer in charge of a patrol was shot through both thighs. Private Kenny, although repeatedly fired on by the enemy, crawled about for more than an hour with his wounded officer on his back, trying to find his way through the fog to the British trenches. He refused to leave the officer although told several times to do so, and at last, utterly exhausted, left him in a comparatively safe ditch and went for help. He found a rescue party and guided them to the wounded officer who was then brought to safety. The officer Lt.

Siemens sold Siemens Mobile to the Taiwan-based BenQ in 2005, subsequently becoming BenQ-Siemens. The last Siemens-branded mobile phones, the AL21, A31 and AF51, were released in November 2005. History The first Siemens mobile phone, the Siemens Mobiltelefon C1, was launched in 1985. In 1994 the Siemens S1 GSM phone was launched. In 1997 Siemens launched the first phone with a colour screen, the Siemens S10, with a screen capable of displaying red, green, blue and white. In the same year Siemens launched the first \\"outdoor\\" phone, the Siemens S10 Active, with enhanced shock, dust and splash protection. Siemens launched the first slider phone, the Siemens SL10, in 1999. Siemens acquired the mobile phone division of Bosch in 2000. In the same year Siemens launched one of the first phones with an MP3 player and external memory card support (MultiMediaCard), the Siemens SL45. In 2003 Siemens launched its first phone running on the Symbian OS operating system, the Siemens SX1. The phone featured hot swappable MultiMediaCard. In the same year Siemens launched the Xelibri range of fashion phones. In 2005 Siemens launched the first phone with real GPS support, the Siemens SXG75.

Born in Streatham, London on 4 February 1886, Foster worked for Wandsworth Council in South West London as a dustman. On 27 July 1915, during the First World War, he enlisted in the 13th Battalion (Wandsworth) East Surrey Regiment, British Army, and went to France with the battalion in June 1916. Foster was 31 years old, and a corporal in the 13th East Surreys, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 24 April 1917 at Villers-Plouich, Nord, France, during an attack, the advance was held up in a portion of the village by two machine-guns which were entrenched and strongly covered by wire entanglements. Corporal Foster, who was in charge of two Lewis guns, succeeded in entering the trench and engaging the enemy guns. One of the Lewis guns was lost, but the corporal rushed forward, bombed the enemy and recovered the gun. Then, getting his two guns into action, he killed the enemy gun team and captured their guns. Foster was also awarded the M√©daille Militaire by France. Foster was discharged from the Army in October 1918 and returned to work with Wandsworth Council. The Council, in recognition of his gallant record, promoted him to Dusting Inspector in which capacity he continued to work for twenty-six years. He died suddenly at the age of 60 on 22 January 1946.

On April 30, 1922, Delta Chi became a general membership social fraternity, eliminating the requirement for men to be studying law, and opening membership to all areas of study. Delta Chi became one of the first international fraternities to abolish \\"hell week\\", when it did so on April 22, 1929. Delta Chi is a charter member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC). As of Fall 2019, Delta Chi has initiated over 116,000 members at over 110 Chapters and Colonies, with 34 Alumni Chapters. Its headquarters is in Indianapolis, Indiana. History of Delta Chi =Founding= According to Frederick Moore Whitney, there were two or three groups working on the idea of a new law fraternity during the spring of 1889. After the class election, there were meetings held in Myron Mckee Crandall's apartment as well as in Monroe Marsh Sweetland's law office. It is not clear how these two groups came together, though there seem to have been some individuals who had attended both groups. Over the summer of 1890, many of the details of the organization were worked out by Myron Mckee Crandall, who had stayed in Ithaca until after school opened. In regard to the adoption of the constitution, Albert Sullard Barnes wrote the following in his 1907 Quarterly article: \\"As I recall it, after refreshing my recollection from the original minutes now in my possession, on the evening of October 13, 1890, six students in the Law School, Brothers John M. Gorham, Thomas J. Sullivan, F.K. Stephens, A.D. Stillman and the writer, together with Myron Crandall and O.L. Potter, graduate students, and Monroe Sweetland, a former Student in the Law School, met in a brother's room and adopted the constitution and by-laws, and organized the Delta Chi Fraternity.\\" The minutes from that meeting state, \\"Charter granted to Cornell Chapter,\\" indicating from the beginning the intent to start a national fraternity. =Delta Chi goes single membership= In 1909 in Ithaca, New York, the 15th Convention of Delta Chi adopted an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting dual-membership (i.e. initiating members of other fraternities, and prohibiting Delta Chi members from joining other fraternities). As a professional law fraternity, Delta Chi had originally allowed members from other general fraternities to join. The change in policy led to the loss of chapters in New York Law, West Virginia, Northwestern and Washington University in St. Louis. =Delta Chi becomes a general fraternity= During World War I, a majority of the members of the active chapters dropping their college courses and enlisting in the armed forces. Chapter houses became almost deserted, and a convention in August 1917 was skipped. At the end of the war, members returned to the universities to complete their courses. The chapter finances were generally in bad condition as were the houses. Attempting to rebuild, many chapters stretched the recruiting restrictions by initiating men who had no intention of studying law. Starting in 1919 in Minneapolis at the 20th Convention, the issue of becoming a general fraternity was debated. In 1921 in Columbus, Ohio at the 21st Convention, two amendments were proposed, for and against general membership respectively. For three days votes were held, until (on a swing vote by the Buffalo Alumni Chapter representative), the Wadsworth amendment was adopted. Ratified in 1922, the amendment made Delta Chi a general fraternity, no longer requiring its members to be law students at their respective universities and colleges.

Organization of the fraternity =Undergraduate officer positions= Delta Chi chapters and colonies have six permanent officer positions. While each position has strict definitions of responsibility, their duties may vary slightly from group to group. *A ‚Äì The \\"A\\" is the president of the chapter or colony. He serves as presiding officer at chapter meetings and chapter events. *B ‚Äì The \\"B\\" is the vice president of the chapter or colony.

Each committee chairman has duties designated by Delta Chi. Committees include subjects such as recruitment, educating new recruits, philanthropy, scholarship, social events, housing, and others. =Support alumni positions= *BB ‚Äì The role of the \\"BB\\" is to mentor, advise and service as a liaison between student members and alumni. This position is required by Delta Chi Law to be a two-year term and served by a Delta Chi alumnus. *Alumni Board of Trustees ‚Äì The purpose of The Alumni Board of Trustees (ABT) is to lead, supervise and advise the chapter. Members may include alumni, chapter officers, parents, grandparents, faculty, and local business & community leaders. Members may be aligned to advise and mentor chapter undergraduate officers and the chapter's committees. *Housing Corporation ‚Äì The role of the Housing Corporation is to manage the chapter or colony housing facilities and all legal responsibilities of such management. Since a Housing Corporation is a separate, incorporated legal entity, it has no requirements set forth by Delta Chi Law. Chapters, colonies, and alumni chapters For a listing of all Delta Chi chapters, colonies, and alumni chapters see List of Delta Chi chapters. Delta Chi chapters are unique in naming. Most college fraternities and sororities are named in an alphabetical Greek system. This is not so with Delta Chi chapters and colonies, who are named by institution, and sometimes by self-naming. Therefore, the first 'Alpha' chapter was the Cornell Chapter.

It originates in the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain), as well as Iberian America (Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries of the Americas). Etymology The word is a compound of the Iberian languages' words for \\"water\\" ( in Spanish; in Catalan; in Portuguese; in Galician) and \\"burning\\"/\\"fiery\\" ( in Spanish; in Catalan; in Portuguese and Galician).  Definition  Aguardientes are strong alcoholic beverages, obtained by fermentation and later distillation of sugared or sweet musts, vegetable macerations, or mixtures of the two. This is the most generic level; by this definition, aguardientes may be made from a number of different sources. Fruit-based aguardientes include those made from oranges, grapes, bananas, or medronho (\\"cane apple\\"). Grain-based ones may be made from millet, barley, or rice and tuber-based aguardientes from beet, manioc, or potato, and finally what are classed as \\"true\\" aguardientes from sugarcane and other sweet canes, including some species of bamboo. Cane aguardiente and cacha√ßa are similar, but distinct, products. Brazil thereafter defined cane aguardiente as an alcoholic beverage of between 38% and 54% ABV, obtained by simple fermentation and distillation of sugarcane that has already been used in sugar-production, and that has a distinct flavour similar to rum. Cacha√ßa, on the other hand, is an alcoholic beverage of between 38% and 48% ABV, obtained by fermenting and distilling sugarcane juice, and may have added sugar up to 6 g/L. =Regulation= According to Spanish and Portuguese versions of European Union spirits regulations,. See Spanish version here and Portuguese version here. aguardiente and aguardente are generic Spanish and Portuguese terms, respectively, for some of the distilled spirits that are fermented and distilled exclusively from their specified raw materials, contain no added alcohol or flavouring substances, and if sweetened, only \\"to round off the final taste of the product\\". However, aguardiente and aguardente are not legal denominations on their own.Chapter I, Article 5. ‚Äì General rules concerning the categories of spirit drinks Instead, different categories of aguardientes (spirits in the English version) are established according to raw materials. In the Spanish version, wine spirit (brandy) is aguardiente de vino, fruit spirit is aguardiente de fruta, grain spirit (other than whiskey and neutral grain spirit) is aguardiente de cereales, etc.Annex II, 1‚Äì14. Many aguardentes have a protected designation of origin, for example: Aguardente de Vinho Douro (wine spirit of Douro), Aguardente Bagaceira Bairrada (grape marc of Bairrada), Aguardente de p√™ra da Lous√£ (pear spirit of Lous√£), Aguardiente de sidra de Asturias (cider spirit of Asturias) or Aguardiente de hierbas de Galicia (herbal spirit of Galicia).Annex III. Regional variations Some drinks named aguardiente or similar are of different origin (grape pomace, sugar cane); other drinks with the same origin may have different names (klairin, brandy). =Brazil= Brazilian cacha√ßa bottle In Brazil, a beverage known as cacha√ßa or pinga, considered distinct from traditional aguardiente, is made from sugar cane. Cacha√ßa, has two varieties: unaged (white) and aged (gold). White cacha√ßa is usually bottled immediately after distillation and tends to be cheaper. It is often used to prepare caipirinha and other beverages in which cacha√ßa is an ingredient. Dark cacha√ßa, usually seen as the \\"premium\\" variety, is aged in wood barrels, and is meant to be drunk neat. Traditionally, no herbs are used to flavour the cacha√ßa, and its flavour is influenced by the fermentation agent, time spent in the cask, or type of wood from which the barrel is made. One form that can be qualified as moonshine is known as \\"Maria Louca\\" (\\"Crazy Mary\\"). This is aguardente, made in jails by inmates. It can be made from many cereals, ranging from beans to rice or whatever can be converted into alcohol, be it fruit peels or candy, using improvised and illegal equipment. =Cape Verde= Grogue, also known as grogu or grogo (derived from English grog), is a Cape Verdean alcoholic beverage, an aguardiente made from sugarcane. Its production is fundamentally artisanal, and nearly all the sugarcane is used in the production of grogue. The cane is processed in a press known as a trapiche. =Chile= In Chile, aguardiente is an alcoholic beverage of 45% and higher ABV (beverages with over 55% ABV are illegal). It is made, like Italian grappa, by distilling the grape residue, primarily the skins and pulp (') plus the stems (') and seeds, left over from winemaking after pressing the grapes. It is used to make several other flavored liquors, such as the murtado or ' (using sun dried murtilla, an orange-reddish wild rose fruit), the ' (soaking sun-dried morello cherries) and licor de oro (flavored with saffron and lemon peel). Dried mint, peeled walnuts, almonds, and other aromatic herbs are also used to flavor the aguardiente. It is mainly consumed by itself, or as a base to make cola de mono (monkey tail). =Colombia= Colombian aguardiente antioque√±o In Colombia, aguardiente is an anise-flavoured liqueur derived from sugar cane, popular in the Andean region. Each department of Colombia holds the rights to produce it, but aguardiente produced in one region can be sold in another. By adding different amounts of aniseed, different flavours are obtained, leading to extensive marketing and fierce competition between brands. Aguardiente has 24%‚Äì29% alcohol content. Other anise-flavoured liqueurs similar to aguardiente, but with a lower alcohol content, are also sold. Aguardiente has maintained, since the Spanish era, the status of the most popular alcoholic beverage in the Andean regions of Colombia, with the notable exception of the Caribbean region, where rum is most popular. In general, aguardiente is rarely drunk in cocktails, and usually drunk neat. In the Caribbean coast there is a moonshine called \\"Cococho\\", an aguardiente infamous for the number of blindness cases due to the addition of methanol. =Costa Rica= In Costa Rica it has 30% alcohol and has a neutral flavour. Guaro is tightly controlled by the Costa Rican government to help prevent clandestine production. =Guam and the Mariana Islands= In Guam and the Mariana Islands, a distilled version of tub√¢ (coconut palm wine introduced from the Philippines) is known as aguajente (also aguayente or agi). It is similar to Filipino lamban√≥g. It used to be prevalent among the Chamorro people but is now largely extinct, after the United States banned its manufacture soon after the acquisition of Guam from the Spanish Empire in 1899. =Ecuador= In Ecuador, aguardiente is also derived from sugar cane, but unlike Colombia, it is left largely unflavoured. It is then taken straight as shots, mulled with cinnamon (canela in Spanish) and fruit juices to make the hot cocktail canelazo, or mixed with the juice of agave masts and Grenadine syrup for the hot cocktail draquita. Locally or artisanally made aguardiente is commonly called punta, \\"puro\\" or trago, and alcohol content can vary widely, from \\"mild\\" puntas of about 10% to \\"strong\\" of about 40% or higher. The traditional distillation process produces aguardiente as strong as 60 g/L. Every Ecuadorian province has a slightly different flavour to the aguardiente produced there, and equally each province has a different recipe for canelazo. In Ecuador, aguardiente is the most commonly consumed strong alcohol. Aguardiente Astillero is one of the newest brands, which is becoming very popular due to its symbolic title especially around Guayas. =Mexico= In Mexico, aguardiente goes by many names, including habanero. In the state of Michoac√°n, charanda is a traditional rum- like sugar cane aguardiente. =Portugal= Home-made Aguardente de Medronhos Portuguese aguardente has several varieties. Aguardente v√≠nica is distilled from wine, either of good quality or undrinkable wines. It is mostly used to fortify wines such as port or aged to make aguardente velha (old burning water), a kind of brandy. Aguardente bagaceira is made from pomace as a way to prevent waste after the close of wine season. It is usually bootlegged, as most drinkers only appreciate it in its traditional formulation of 50% to 80% ABV. A common way to drink it is as caf√© com cheirinho (\\"coffee with a little scent\\"), a liqueur coffee made with espresso. In the Azores, this espresso- aguardente combination is commonly referred to as caf√© com m√∫sica (coffee with music). Aguardente Medronho is a variety distilled from the fruit of the Arbutus unedo tree. In Madeira, it is the core ingredient for poncha, a beverage around which a festival is based. Most of the aguardente from the region is made from sugar cane. =Spain= In certain areas of the Pyrenees, aguardiente, known locally to Catalonians as aiguardent, is used as an essential ingredient in the preparation of tup√≠, a type of cheese.Formatge de tup√≠ - Ingredients i preparaci√≥ artesanal Galicia is renowned for the quality and variety of its aguardientes, probably the most famous of which is augardente de bagazo (Aguardiente de Orujo), which is obtained from the distillation of the pomace of grapes, and is clear and colourless. It typically contains over 50% alcohol, sometimes significantly more, and is still made traditionally in many villages across Galicia today. Augardente de herbas, usually yellow in colour, is a sweet liqueur made with Augardente de bagazo and herbs (herbas), with chamomile being a substantial ingredient.Galicia Espallada Licor caf√© (typical distilled drink in the province of Ourense), black in colour, is a sweet liqueur made with augardente de bagazo, coffee (caf√©), and sugar. Crema de Augardente\\" or \\"Crema de Ca√±a is a cream liqueur based on augardente, coffee, cream, milk and other ingredients. It is similar to Irish cream liqueur. In some places in Galicia, a small glass is traditionally taken at breakfast time as a tonic before a hard day's work on the land. The word orujo is actually Spanish and not Galician but is used to distinguish Galician and some Spanish augardentes from those of other countries.Gastronomia Galega Most of the moonshine in Spain is made as a byproduct of wine making by distilling the squeezed skins of the grapes. The basic product is called orujo or aguardiente (burning water). The homemade versions are usually stronger and have a higher alcoholic content, well over the 40% that the commercial versions typically have. Starting with orujo there are a countless number of blends and flavours around. Typically adding herbs, spices or berries or fruits or mixing the moonshine with other distillates.

The main objective of the project was to demonstrate the ability of a pure jet to vertically takeoff, hover, transition to horizontal forward flight, and vertically land. Development Just after World War II, Ryan engineers wondered whether the Ryan/U.S. Navy FR-1 Fireball, which had a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1 at low fuel quantities, would take off vertically. The United States Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics in 1947 awarded Ryan a contract, originally under the designation F3R,The Aeroplane, Volume 87, 1954. to investigate the development of a vertically launched jet fighter. This was part of a program to evaluate the feasibility of submarine-based aircraft. Ryan conducted remote controlled VTOL tethered rig tests from 1947 to 1950 and a flying rig in 1951. Ryan was awarded an Air Force contract in 1953 to develop an actual flying jet-powered VTOL aircraft, which was given the designation X-13. Two prototypes were built. The Ryan X-13 Vertijet was long. It was just large enough to accommodate the single-place cockpit with a tilting seat and the thrust Rolls- Royce Avon turbojet. The high-mounted delta wing of the aircraft had a wingspan of only and was capped with flat endplates. The nose of the aircraft had a hook on the underside and a short pole for gauging distance from the trailer. The hook was used to hang the Vertijet from the vertical trailer bed landing platform. After the aircraft was secured vertically, the trailer was lowered to horizontal and then used to transport the aircraft on the ground. Pitch and yaw control in hover were provided by vectored engine thrust. Roll control was provided by \\"puffer\\" jets (also known as \\"jet reaction control\\") mounted outboard of the wingtip endplates. The first prototype (#54-1619) was fitted with temporary landing gear and made its first horizontal flight on December 10, 1955. Later, it made full horizontal to vertical attitude conversions and back again at altitude. The first prototype then had the landing gear replaced with a tail-mounted framework that held it in a vertical attitude on the ground. Using this rig, hooking practice was conducted. The second prototype (#54-1620), on April 11, 1957, made a vertical take-off from the vertically raised trailer, transitioned to horizontal flight and back again. It then returned to the vertical trailer and landed by hooking the landing wire. Flight tests were performed by two test pilots: Ryan's Chief Test Pilot Peter F. \\"Pete\\" Girard, and Ryan Test Pilot W. L. \\"Lou\\" Everett. On July 28‚Äì29, 1957, the X-13 was demonstrated in Washington, D.C. It crossed the Potomac River and landed at the Pentagon. The Air Force chose not to continue development of the Ryan X-13 Vertijet because of the lack of an operational requirement. Operational history 1957 flight test The X-13 was designed to investigate vertical takeoff, horizontal flight transition, and return to vertical flight for landing. The first prototype of the X-13 was equipped with temporary tricycle landing gear. The X-13 was flown conventionally on December 10, 1955 to test its aerodynamic characteristics. The Vertijet was then fitted with a temporary \\"tail sitting\\" rig. On May 28, 1956, it was flown from the ground in a vertical position to test its hovering qualities. The X-13 VertiJet completed its first full-cycle flight at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 11, 1957, when it took off vertically from its mobile trailer, angled over into a horizontal attitude, and flew for several minutes. The X-13 then transitioned to vertical flight and slowly descended back onto its trailer and landed. Survivors X-13 at the National Museum of the USAF Only two X-13 aircraft were built and both are on public display: *Serial number 54-1619 is on display at the Gillespie Field Annex of the San Diego Air & Space Museum. *Serial number 54-1620 which was the Vertijet which made the full-cycle flight on April 11, 1957 was transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Dayton, Ohio, in May 1959.United States Air Force Museum 1975, p. 72.

He and his wife, Joy, were depicted in the film Born Free and best-selling book with the same title, which is based on the true story of Elsa the Lioness, an orphaned lioness cub they had raised and later released into the wild. Several other films have been made based on Adamson's life. Life George Alexander Graham Adamson was born 3 February 1906 in Etawah, India to British parents. He was educated at Dean Close School, Cheltenham, England. He moved to Kenya in 1924. After a series of jobs, which included time as a gold prospector, goat trader and professional safari hunter, he joined Kenya's wildlife department in 1938 and was Senior Wildlife Warden of the Northern Frontier District. Six years later, he married Joy. It was in 1956 that he raised the lioness cub, Elsa, who he helped to release into the wild and who became the subject of the 1966 feature film Born Free based on the book written by Joy. Adamson retired as a wildlife warden in 1961 and devoted himself to raising lions that could not look after themselves and training them to survive in the wild. In 1970, he moved to the Kora National Reserve in northern Kenya to continue the rehabilitation of captive or orphaned big cats for eventual reintroduction into the wild. George and Joy separated in 1970, but continued to spend Christmas holidays together until she was murdered on 3 January 1980. Death On 20 August 1989, George Adamson was murdered near his camp in Kora National Park, by Somali bandits, when he went to the rescue of his assistant and a young European tourist in the Kora National Park. He was 83 years old. George is buried in the Kora National Park near his brother, Terance and Boy, one of the Lions who was part of the Born Free film. Two other lions are buried next to Adamson as well: Super Cub, and Mugie, a lion released in Kora after George's death. Film and television *Born Free (1966), based on the book of the same name by Joy Adamson about Elsa the Lioness, that was rehabilitated into the wild, but remained in a friendly relationship with the Adamsons.

The 75th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. In a rematch of the previous year's World Series, the Yankees won, four games to two, to repeat as champions. As of 2020, it remains the most recent World Series to feature a rematch of the previous season's matchup.https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/ The 1978 series was the first of 10 consecutive years that saw 10 different teams win the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers would break the string with a World Series win in 1988, having won in 1981. This series had two memorable confrontations between Dodgers rookie pitcher Bob Welch and the Yankees' Reggie Jackson. In Game 2, Welch struck out Jackson in the top of the ninth with two outs and the tying and go-ahead runs on base to end the game. Jackson would avenge the strikeout, when in Game 4 he singled off Welch which moved Roy White to second, from which White would score the game winning run on a Lou Piniella single to tie the series at 2-2. In Game 6, Jackson smashed a two-run homer off Welch in the seventh to increase the Yankees' lead to 7‚Äì2 and put a final \\"exclamation point\\" on the Yankees' victory to win the series. This also was the first time that we saw both a rematch of the previous World Series, but also the same outcome. In both 1977 and 1978 the Yankees defeated the Dodgers by a score of 4 games to 2. Background It wasn't easy for these two teams to repeat as their respective league's champions, both scrambling back to the Fall Classic late in the season. =New York Yankees= The New York Yankees were as far back as 14 games behind the Boston Red Sox at mid-July suffering from injuries to pitchers Catfish Hunter and Jim Beattie. A public display of antipathy between manager Billy Martin and slugger Reggie Jackson resulted in the replacement of Martin by the amenable, easygoing Bob Lemon on July 17. With time running out, the Yankees, four games behind the Red Sox in the American League East, began a crucial four-game series at Fenway Park in Boston. On September 7, the Yanks began the \\"Boston Massacre\\" with a drubbing of the BoSox, with second baseman Willie Randolph driving in five runs. (Randolph was sidelined in the postseason, due to a pulled hamstring in late September.) The assault continued with the Yankees winning game two game three (Ron Guidry winning his 21st‚Äîa two-hitter), and an 18-hit, victory in game four, completing the sweep. The Yankees and Red Sox were now tied for first place with 20 games remaining for New York went in their last 68 scheduled games, but lost on the final day to Cleveland to finish the regular season in a dead-heat with Boston at . The Yanks had to travel to Fenway for the one- game playoff on Monday, October 2. Down 2‚Äì0 after six innings, they won , made famous by light-hitting Bucky Dent's clutch three-run homer in the seventh inning (his fifth of the year). Ron Guidry won his 25th game (against only three losses) and Goose Gossage recorded the last eight outs for his 27th save, retiring Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski with the tying run at third base for the final out. =Los Angeles Dodgers= In the National League the Los Angeles Dodgers were locked in a tight three-way race with the rival San Francisco Giants and Cincinnati Reds falling as far as games back. Taking a lesson from the in-fighting Yankees, this normally close-knit group caught fire after a clubhouse fight between teammates Steve Garvey and Don Sutton in August, ultimately finishing games ahead of the Cincinnati Reds. Unlike the 1977 Dodgers with four 30+ home run hitters, this squad's leader in home runs was Reggie Smith with 29. No pitcher won 20 or more games but five pitchers did win at least ten games. Rookie Bob Welch was a key after being promoted from the minors, winning seven games and saving three while being utilized as both a starter and reliever. During the World Series the Dodgers wore on their uniforms a black patch with the number 19 in dedication to coach Jim Gilliam, who died from a brain hemorrhage two days before the start of the Series. His uniform number was retired by the Dodgers prior to the start of game one. =League Championship Series= In a repeat of the 1977 playoffs the Yankees again dispatched the Kansas City Royals, this time three games to one as the Dodgers did the same to the Philadelphia Phillies by the same margin. After losing the first two games of the World Series, the Yankees would become the first team to come back to win the Series in six. The Dodgers would duplicate that feat against the Yankees in the 1981 World Series. Summary Matchups =Game 1= With Yankee ace Ron Guidry unavailable at least until Game 3, the Dodgers pounded 20-game winner Ed Figueroa. Figueroa left after two innings, allowing home runs to Dusty Baker and Davey Lopes. Lopes would add a three-run shot in the fourth off Ken Clay to make it 6‚Äì0. Another Dodger run crossed the plate in the fifth; Ron Cey scoring on a Clay wild pitch. The Yankees tried to claw back in the seventh as Reggie Jackson homered and Bucky Dent singled in two runs, but the Dodgers bounced back with three of their own, two coming on a Bill North double. The Dodgers would cruise to an easy Game 1 win from there. =Game 2= Ron Cey drove in all the Dodgers' runs with a single in the fourth and a three-run homer in the sixth off Yankee starter Catfish Hunter. Reggie Jackson would try to keep pace by batting in all three of the Yankee runs with a two-run double and RBI groundout, but this game would be remembered for one memorable Jackson at-bat. Rookie Bob Welch was brought in to pitch the ninth to save the game for Burt Hooton. He allowed Bucky Dent and Willie Randolph to reach base between outs, bringing up Jackson. Welch ran the count to 3‚Äì2. Jackson fouled off several pitches before Welch finally got a fastball by him, sending the Dodger Stadium crowd into a frenzy. In post-game interviews, Jackson initially blamed his striking out on Bucky Dent running from second with the 3‚Äì2 pitch and distracting him from focusing on Welch. In later interviews, however, Jackson would give Welch his proper due. =Game 3= With the Yankees desperately needing a win, ace Ron Guidry provided a victory aided by the stunning defense of third baseman Graig Nettles. Guidry pitched a complete game, even though he allowed eight hits, walked seven, and struck out only four. Nettles' defense saved at least four runs. The Yankees got on the board in the first off Don Sutton on a Roy White homer and added a run in the second on an RBI forceout by Bucky Dent. In the third, the Dodgers began to come back against Guidry, who clearly did not have his best stuff. Bill North led off with a walk, stole second, then went to third on a Steve Yeager groundout. Davey Lopes hit a hard liner Nettles snared to turn a certain extra-base hit into a key out and temporarily save a run. Bill Russell followed with an infield single to score North and drive in the Dodgers' only run. The next batter, Reggie Smith, hit a hard ground ball to third. Nettles made a diving stop to save another extra-base hit and probable run, and threw Smith out at first to end the inning. In the fifth, the Dodgers had runners on first and second with two outs when Smith came up to bat. Nettles knocked down Smith's sharply hit ground ball down the third base line. Smith reached first, but no runs scored. Steve Garvey, the next batter up, hit another hard ground ball down the third base line, and Nettles made a backhanded stop and forced Smith at second base to end the inning. The Dodgers loaded the bases again with two outs in the sixth inning, but Nettles again made a great stop on a ball hit by Davey Lopes, and threw to second to complete the inning-ending force play. The Yankees would later add three more runs. Thurman Munson and Reggie Jackson had RBI singles in the rally that put the game out of reach, despite an otherwise fine pitching performance by Sutton. In the top of the ninth inning, when Lopes came to bat, he jokingly waved Nettles away from the third base line. Nettles shook it off. =Game 4= Starters Ed Figueroa and Tommy John were locked in a scoreless duel before Reggie Smith struck with a three-run homer in the top of the fifth inning. John continued his shutout through the fifth, but, in the Yankees' half of the sixth, they scored. Reggie Jackson finally got the Yankees on the board with a one-out RBI single. With Thurman Munson on second and Jackson on first, Lou Piniella hit a low, soft liner shortstop Bill Russell fumbled (some claim intentionally). Russell recovered the ball, then stepped on second to force Jackson, then his attempted throw to first to complete the double play struck a \\"confused\\" Jackson in the right hip and caromed into foul territory. Munson scored, partially because first baseman Steve Garvey stopped to yell at the first-base umpire over the non-interference call before retrieving the ball. The Dodgers' protests went for naught but would not have been necessary if Russell had made the proper play. Thinking Russell was going to catch Piniella's liner, Munson retreated towards second and was on second base when Russell picked up the ball. Munson then turned to third and Russell stepped on second to force Jackson and threw to first. The inning would have been over if Russell had tagged Munson (out #2) and stepped on second (out #3) to force Jackson or Russell steps on second to force Jackson (out #2) and gets Munson in a rundown between second and third (out #3); the score would have remained 3‚Äì1, instead the score was then 3‚Äì2. But of course, Russell had no reason to the think his throw would not reach first base. Later review of the play clearly showed Jackson had stopped midway between first and second when Russell had made his throw to first. As the ball carried very close to Jackson's immediate right, Jackson had moved his hips to the right just as the ball sailed past, deflecting the ball down the first base line. While Jackson continued to deny it, Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, along with other eyewitnesses, steadfastly believed the Yankees outfielder purposefully interfered in the play. The Yankees tied it in the eighth when Munson doubled home Paul Blair. The score remained tied until the bottom of the tenth inning. Dodgers rookie and Game 2 hero Bob Welch walked Roy White with one out. After Welch retired Munson, Jackson strode to the plate for his first confrontation with Welch since Game 2. This time, Jackson got the better end by singling White to second. Lou Piniella then lined a single to center, scoring White and tying the series. The bungled Russell/Jackson play changed the game and the entire Series; instead of the Dodgers going up 3‚Äì1 in games, the Series was then tied and the momentum shifted to the Yankees who outscored the Dodgers 19‚Äì4 in the final two games. =Game 5= The Yankees took one step closer to a repeat World Series championship on the strength of an unexpected complete game victory by young Jim Beattie. Beattie scattered nine Dodgers hits and was buoyed by an 18-hit Yankees performance, including a World Series-record 16 singles. Early on, the Dodgers tried to run to take advantage of a sore- shouldered Thurman Munson behind the plate. Davey Lopes led off the game with a single, stole second, and scored on a Reggie Smith single. The Dodgers stretched their lead to 2‚Äì0 in the third when Lopes scored again on a double by Bill Russell. But, that would be it as Beattie settled down and shut out the Dodgers the rest of the way. In the bottom of the third, after a leadoff walk and single, Roy White's RBI single cut the Dodgers' lead to 2‚Äì1. After a double steal, Munson's two-run single put the Yankees up 3‚Äì2. One out later, Lou Piniella's RBI single made it 4‚Äì2 Yankees and knocked starter Burt Hooton out of the game. Next inning, after two one-out singles, Mickey Rivers's RBI single and White's sacrifice fly made it 6‚Äì2 Yankees. Charlie Hough relieved Lance Rautzhan and allowed an RBI single to Munson. In the seventh, with runners on second and third and two outs, a strike three wild pitch by Hough to Rivers allowed a run to score and Rivers to reach first. White's RBI single made it 9‚Äì2 Yankees, then Munson's two-run double increased their lead to 11‚Äì2. They scored one more run in the eighth on Bucky Dent's RBI double off Hough as their 12‚Äì2 win gave them a 3‚Äì2 series lead heading back to Los Angeles. =Game 6= Game 6 turned out to be the Bucky Dent‚ÄìBrian Doyle show. Davey Lopes gave the Dodgers home crowd a ray of hope with a leadoff home run off Catfish Hunter. Dent and Doyle put the Yankees ahead in the second; Doyle with an RBI double, Dent with an RBI single and an additional run scoring on an error on the play. Lopes had an RBI single in the third to cut it to 3‚Äì2 through the fifth inning, but that would be it for the Dodgers. Sutton pitched well until the sixth inning. Dent and Doyle pushed the score to 5‚Äì2 in the sixth with RBI singles and Reggie Jackson put the final nail in the Dodgers coffin with a tremendous two-run blast in the seventh inning to get revenge against his Game 2 nemesis, Bob Welch. Dent would be named World Series MVP, batting .417 with ten hits, seven RBI, and three runs scored. Doyle would make a claim for the MVP himself with a .438 average, seven hits, two RBI, and four runs. While Lopes had a monster series with three homers and seven RBIs and Bill Russell had 11 hits, the Dodgers power hitters lack of production and the Dodgers shoddy defense was their downfall. Steve Garvey (5‚Äìfor‚Äì24, no RBIs) was no factor, and neither were Dusty Baker (5‚Äìfor‚Äì21, one RBI) or Ron Cey (no RBIs after Game 2) and the Dodgers defense committed seven errors. Thurman Munson caught the final out of the game on a foul pop by Cey. This would be the final post-season game for Thurman Munson before his death during the 1979 season. Composite box 1978 World Series (4‚Äì2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) Aftermath This Series is tied with the 1980 World Series for the highest overall television ratings to date, with the six games averaging a Nielsen rating of 32.8 and a share of 56. The Yankees became the last repeat World Champions until 15 years later (‚Äì; Toronto Blue Jays). This would be the last time the Yankees would win a World Series until . The Dodgers would go on to win the World Series in , against the Yankees in the same way the Yankees won this series (losing the first two games, then winning the next four), and , against the Oakland Athletics. For the Yankees, they would again lose the first two games of the World Series in 1996 against the Atlanta Braves, then win the next four games. This would be the last World Series championship for the city of New York until the Yankees' cross-town rivals, the Mets, won in when they defeated the Red Sox four games to three.

Career Born in Portsmouth, Riggs is a self-taught artist, both in his traditional painting and in his digital work. He began drawing and painting as early as he can remember. He also attended art school, but he was expelled after complaining about the course. Riggs' most famous achievement is his work with Iron Maiden and his creation of Eddie, the band's mascot and subject of their album and single covers. Riggs' first picture of Eddie was originally entitled \\"Electric Matthew Says Hello,\\" and was actually painted for a possible punk cover. Iron Maiden's management came across it while looking through Riggs' portfolio, and asked him to add hair to the figure to make it look less punk-like. The resulting picture was used for the debut album, Iron Maiden, released in 1980, and Riggs went on to work with Iron Maiden throughout the 1980s and into the '90s, creating many of the band's famous album covers. In 1992, however, the band decided to accept contributions from other artists for their next album, Fear of the Dark, resulting in much less input from Riggs in recent years. Riggs has also designed the cover of World's Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden, the self-titled debut album by the all-female tribute band, the Iron Maidens, a piece which was inspired by the Killers album, featuring a similar \\"Kinky Sex Shop\\" which featured in the Iron Maiden artwork. He has also worked with Iron Maiden lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson for his album Accident of Birth, Stratovarius for their album Infinite, Gamma Ray for their Power Plant album, Artension on their 2004 album Future World, Gillman on their 2003 album Cuauhtemoc, and with many other bands and companies most of which are featured on his website. Riggs currently resides in America.

Background He was the son of James Kenna, of Liverpool, who was descended from a family of minor gentry from County Meath. Kenna was educated at St. Augustine's College in Ramsgate, Stonyhurst College and St. Francis Xavier College in Liverpool - he is honoured in a memorial which can be seen in the main hall of the current college site in Beaconsfield Road, Liverpool and by a plaque and a portrait at Stonyhurst.

Its 11 active chapters go by different names on different campuses, including Saint Anthony Hall, The Order of St. Anthony, the Fraternity of Delta Psi (ŒîŒ®), St. A's, the Hall and the Number Six Club. Its first chapter (Alpha) was founded at Columbia University on January 17, 1847, the feast day of St. Anthony. As of 2016, nearly all chapters of St. Anthony Hall have gone co-ed; only three (University of Pennsylvania, University of Virginia, and Ole Miss) remain all- male. At both the University of North Carolina (1967) and Ole Miss, St. Anthony Hall was the first campus fraternity to admit African-American members, in 1967 at the University of North Carolina. The chapter at Yale University was, in 1961, the first chapter of the fraternity as well as the second society on campus to admit a person of color (from Trinidad and Tobago), and would later also be the first to admit women, in 1971. In 1879, Baird's Manual characterized the fraternity as having \\"the reputation of being the most secret of all the college societies.\\" References to St. Anthony Hall have appeared in the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald, John O'Hara, and Tom Wolfe. History and chapters circa 1873 symbol from the University of Pennsylvania Record undergraduate yearbook In 1847, after the fraternity's Alpha chapter was founded at Columbia University, a Beta chapter at New York University was formed; in 1853, the two had united. By 1879, Columbia College's Record listed the NYU founders alongside its own students. The currently chartered chapters of St. Anthony Hall are: *Alpha: Columbia University, New York, New York (Co- ed, residential) *Delta: University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (All male, residential) *Upsilon: University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia (All male, residential) *Epsilon: Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut (Co-ed, residential) *Theta: Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey (Co-ed) *Kappa: Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island (Co-ed, residential) *Xi: University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina (Co-ed, residential) *Phi: University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi (All-male, residential) *Sigma: Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut (Co-ed) *Tau: MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts - aka \\"The Number Six Club\\" (Co-ed, residential) *Iota: Rochester, New York, formerly at University of Rochester (Co-ed, off campus) Many of St. Anthony Hall's chapter houses are referred to colloquially as \\"The Hall\\" or \\"St. A's\\", although at MIT, the society is known as \\"The Number Six Club\\" in reference to that chapter's original residence at No. 6 Louisburg Square in Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood. According to its national website, St. Anthony Hall originally began in 1847 as a \\"fraternity dedicated to the love of education and the well-being of its members.\\" Chapters were then founded throughout the Northeast, and extended into the South during the mid-19th century. During the Civil War, however, formal contact ended between Northern and Southern chapters, though contact was restored between remaining and refounded chapters after the War. The fraternity's history states that \\"many members wore their badges into battle, serving with distinction on both sides, and were often reunited in both pleasant and antagonistic situations throughout the war\\". *See the Baird's Manual excerpt below for a near-contemporary account of the disposition of the chapters following the Civil War. *Archive photo of Civil War officer killed at Gettysburg, who signed his portrait \\"Yours in Delta Psi\\". Because their patron is often depicted with a Tau Cross, the symbol has been used to embellish the architecture of some St. A's chapter houses. Membership Yale began admitting women in 1969 and St. A's became the earliest Yale society to accept women as members that same year. St. A's occupies a unique status at Yale. It resembles a \\"senior society\\" (see List of Yale University student organizations) in that its senior members are precluded from joining another senior society; however, it is unique in that it is a three-year society, admitting members during their sophomore year. Some other Yale societies would later also transition to co-ed membership, such as Skull and Bones in 1992. (See also secret society.) It thus had a two- year advantage over the purely senior societies in admitting female members. The Yale chapter's action also accomplished, albeit not without friction, co- education as a permitted status within the national fraternity. Charlie Scott, a member of St. A's at the University of North Carolina became the first person of color to pledge any fraternity at that campus, in 1967. *Other St. A's chapters subsequently became co-ed at Columbia University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, MIT, and Trinity College. *The chapters at Brown University, Princeton University, and the University of Rochester, all inactive since the 19th century, were re-founded as co-ed chapters in 1983, 1986, and 2010, respectively. *The University of Pennsylvania, the University of Mississippi and the University of Virginia chapters remain all-male. Activities Student St. A's members at various chapters pursue their literary mandate through different programs. The Columbia, University of North Carolina, and Brown University chapters have published poetry journals. Also at the University of North Carolina, the chapter hosts events open to the community such as \\"Poetry, Prose and Pancakes.\\" The Brown University chapter publishes a literary and visual arts magazine, also available online, called \\"The Sketchbook.\\" The Trinity College chapter endows a St. Anthony Professorship in Art History, several annual prizes for Trinity students, and an annual public lecture, named for Martin W. Clement (Class of 1901). Yale's chapter sponsors a public series of lectures every two to three weeks on literature, poetry, art and current affairs in general. It is compared to but more generalized than the annual Maynard Mack Lecture of Yale's Elizabethan Club, down the block, whose sessions with actors and directors focus on Shakespeare's era. The Yale St. Anthony Hall lectures, some co-sponsored with the Yale Review recently have included Gay Talese, D. A. Powell, Tom Perotta, Ilya Kaminsky, Tao Lin, Dave Eggers, Roddy Lumsden, Elizabeth Bear, Vona Groarke, Conor O'Callaghan, John Guare, Claire Messud, Elizabeth Alexander, William Deresiewicz, Richard Wilbur, Henri Cole, Chris Adrian, Heidi Julavits, Joseph Harrison, Mark Strand, Wayne Koestenbaum, Dana Levin, Irving Feldman, John Butler, Maurice Manning, Peter Orszag, Michael Donaghy, Paul Muldoon, Martin Puryear, Robert Young Pelton, Rosa DeLauro, Donald Kagan, Bhagavan Das, Robert Stone, Peter Matthiessen, Agha Shahid Ali, Richard Selzer, Naomi Wolf, Carl Andre, Richard Haas, Robert P.

The University of Pennsylvania Delta chapter also hosts an annual lecture series that has recently included guests such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Rishel, Brian Tierney, a Delta chapter member and the current publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer. Tom Wolfe also made an impromptu appearance while conducting research for his book \\"I am Charlotte Simmons.\\"Daily Pennsylvanian website St. Anthony Hall chapter houses The majority of St. Anthony Hall chapters still own the Victorian, Gilded Age, Art Deco, and Beaux Arts chapter houses some of its socially prominent members commissioned from well-known 19th century and early 20th century architects. One of the buildings, at Yale, (its third on that campus), when donated by Frederick William Vanderbilt in 1913, was described by the New York Times as \\"the most expensive and elaborate secret society building in the United States\\". In accordance with the respective traditions of each chapter, St. A's is now self-described and referred to on different campuses as a fraternity (or co-ed fraternity), a literary society, a secret society, or a private club.

Either the Firm of James Renwick, Jr., and attributable to the master architect's hand‚Äîor at least supervision‚Äîor specifically, William Hamilton Russell (1856‚Äì1907), an architect in the firm (and great-nephew of Renwick) and then-recent graduate of St. Anthony Hall. Old photographs show a high stoop arrangement with the figure of an owl on the peaked roof and a plaque with the Greek letters Delta Psi over the windowless chapter room. In 1879 The New York Tribune called it French Renaissance, but the stumpy pilasters and blocky detailing suggest the Neo-Grec style then near the end of its popularity. At the turn of the 20th century, when the building became a club for graduate members of the fraternity and a new undergraduate house was built at 115th Street, a newspaper account described the 28th Street house as \\"a perfect Bijou of tasteful decoration\\". Upon graduation in 1887, Russell became a prot√©g√© of his great uncle, James Renwick, Jr., the same year Renwick completed his best- known work, St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. It is likely that Russell contributed work to his fraternity's first chapter house during his apprenticeship. Another article in the New York Times (1987) asserts that Russell was actually responsible (while in Renwick's firm) for the building. Another of Renwick's prot√©g√©s, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, was architect of the Wolf's Head tomb at Yale.

The building has recently undergone extensive interior restorations. An exterior addition, in harmony with the original construction, has been added to comply with local building code requirements. J. C.

Interior details described include limestone columns, a detailed, wrought-iron front door and gate, a limestone and marble entry foyer, and a bronze and wrought- iron main staircase. In addition, the townhouse boasted ornate moldings, high ceilings, skylights, oak Versailles parquet floors and six wood-burning fireplaces. It is also included in a walking tour of 64th Street The five- story, brownstone is on a historically distinguished residential street. In the early 1970s, the Barnard College Club leased space in the St. Anthony Club. *Stone, Carpenter, and Willson, (Kappa chapter, Brown University chapter, 154 Hope Street, Providence, Rhode Island, erected in 1895, Colonial Revival).

An Epsilon chapter (Trinity College) member, Cady in 1873 built the Yale Sheffield Scientific School's first new building, North Sheffield Hall, on what had been the gardens of the Town-Sheffield mansion. This was followed by his Winchester Hall (1892) and Sheffield Chemical (1894‚Äì95). Of these, only the latter, Sheffield Chemical, is still standing, renovated and renamed Arthur K. Watson Hall. *Marcel Breuer. Subsequent to the merger of the 'Sheff' with Yale College, but within its original precincts, Yale St. A's chapter member and benefactor Henry P. Becton (BS 1937), son of Becton Dickinson co-founder Maxwell Becton, donated the Becton Center (designed by Marcel Breuer), opened in 1970, replacing Winchester Hall and North Sheffield, mentioned above. Breuer cenceived the building \\"...as a wall that folded horizontally and vertically, with pipes and ducts located in the folds...\\" Located at 15 Prospect Street, the building's most distinctive feature is an arcade of monumental Tau Cross-shaped concrete columns \\"designed to invite pedestrians.\\" It appears as a visual reference to the benefactor's society, whose emblem is the Tau Cross; the buildings are within each other's view along the axis formed by Prospect and College Streets. Described and pictured in the Yale University website. *A late 19th/early 20th century chapter house of the University of Mississippi's St. Anthony Hall Phi chapter subsequently was an on-campus childhood home of later Nobel Laureate author William Faulkner, although Rowan Oak is better known for having been his home when he achieved greatness. The older house was a large brick turreted edifice where the Alumni Center Hotel now stands. The Falkners lived in it during the period 1912‚Äì22 when fraternities were outlawed and was the first building of note that incoming freshmen saw when they walked from the train station into campus. It and a successor burned down. The Cofield photographic Collection , p. 58, cites Faulkner's younger brother, Dean Faulkner, that his brother's room was in the tower. Exclusions and obsolete chapters The former Delta Psi fraternity at the University of Vermont (1850-2004) was always unrelated. In 1879, Baird's Manual (see Wikisource, the free library of source texts.), contained an extensive Delta Psi/St. Anthony Hall chapter list. Baird's characterized the organization, at that time, as having \\"the reputation of being the most secret of all the college societies.\\" Chapters at the end of the 19th century were: * Alpha, Columbia College, 1847. * Beta, New York University, 1847 (closed 1853). * Gamma, Rutgers College, 1848 (closed 1850). * Delta, Burlington College (Burlington, NJ), 1849; transferred to Delta, University of Pennsylvania, 1854. * Epsilon, Trinity College (Connecticut), 1850. * Eta, South Carolina College, 1850 (closed 1861). * Theta, Princeton College, 1851 (closed 1863). * Iota, University of Rochester, 1851 (closed 1895). * Kappa, Brown University, 1852 (closed 1853). * Lambda, Williams College, 1853 (closed 1969). * Sigma, Randolph-Macon College, 1853 (closed 1861). * Xi, North Carolina University, 1851 (closed 1863). * Psi, Cumberland University, 1858 (closed 1861). * Phi, University of Mississippi, 1855. * Upsilon, University of Virginia, 1860. * Sigma, Sheffield Scientific School (Yale University), 1868. * Theta, Washington-Lee University, 1869. * Tau, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1889. Baird's 1999 edition amends the last listing for Washington and Lee as Beta (defunct). * The Xi chapter was re-founded in 1926, as was the Phi chapter, which had become extinct again in 1912. * The Lambda chapter closed in 1969 when Williams College banned fraternal activities. An alumni foundation remains. * The Kappa chapter at Brown University was re-founded in 1983, * The Theta chapter was re-founded at Princeton University in 1986, and * The Iota chapter was re-founded at the University of Rochester in 2010. The 1999 edition of Baird's appeared unaware of the re-founding of Theta, erroneously listing that as Theta's last year. Baird's text also noted information regarding the effects of the Civil War ‚Äì- then, just forty years past ‚Äî- on the Order, and contemporary references to several of the fraternity chapter buildings that still exist today: \\"The Beta chapter was declared extinct in 1853, and its members affiliated with the Alpha. The Gamma and Theta disbanded. The Alpha has a fine chapter house in East Twenty-eighth Street, New York City. The Epsilon has one of the most expensive chapter houses in the country,Delta Psi website $40,000 having been given for that purpose by one of the members. The Kappa chapter had been repudiated by the fraternity by 1855, but its official existence was recognized in the catalogue draft of 1876. The Southern chapters were closed by the war, and only the Phi and Upsilon were revived at its close. The Lambda owns a chapter house, and the Iota and one or two others have building funds.\\" (1879 text, from Wikisource.) In popular culture * The society tabloid Gawker said \\"In the constellation of collegiate societies‚Äîfraternities, sororities, eating clubs, final clubs, and the like‚Äîfew are more exclusive, and WASPy, as St. Anthony Hall, or St. A's as it is commonly known...\\" * Delta Brother E. Digby Baltzell popularized the term \\"WASP\\" in his 1964 book The Protestant Establishment: Aristocracy and Caste in America. * In December 1967, during a week-long fellowship on campus, then-California Governor Ronald Reagan was filmed for public television informally debating Yale students at the Yale St. Anthony Hall. Nancy Reagan is also present, as the Yalies quiz the governor on Vietnam and various social justice issues. * John O'Hara, in his 1960 novel Ourselves to Know, uses St. Anthony Hall membership in the characterizations of the protagonists: \\"Did you join a fraternity at Penn?\\" I said. \\"Yes I did. St Anthony-Delta Psi. But I think they were sorry that they invited me...\\" --- \\"I happened to know, because I had seen it, that he had a Delta Psi Tea Company gold charm on his watch chain, but the reason he did not show it was one of delicacy; in 1908 they had not accepted his resignation but he kept the insigne hidden...\\" --- \\"He and Robert quickly looked at each other's watch-chain and the Delta Psi charm and smiled. \\"You know, I've been meaning to write you a letter...\\" (\\"Tea\\" Company was a then-used appellation referring to the fraternity's Tau Cross emblem.) * During the Klondike Gold Rush Fall of 1897 Jack London was a tenant in Dawson of two mining engineers who were graduates of Yale named Marshall Latham Bond and Louis Whitford Bond. Among the other cabin residents was Oliver LaFarge, son of John LaFarge. The three men had the cabin designated a chapter house. Thus much of the period that London was in the Klondike he was a St. Anthony's guest. The cabin residents inspired many characters in Jack London stories including \\"The Call of the Wild\\". * The \\"St. Ray's\\" fraternity in Tom Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons is modeled after the Delta chapter ‚Äî\\"St. A's\\"‚Äî at the University of Pennsylvania where Wolfe attended a fraternity cocktail party while conducting research for the book in 2001. *Lisa Birnbach, ed.

But, like most boys, he bragged tremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from it. There was Genevieve Ormonde, who regularly made the rounds of dances, house-parties, and football games at Princeton, Yale, Williams, and Cornell; there was black-eyed Roberta Dillon, who was quite as famous to her own generation as Hiram Johnson or Ty Cobb; and, of course, there was Marjorie Harvey, who besides having a fairylike face and a dazzling, bewildering tongue was already justly celebrated for having turned five cart-wheels in succession during the last pump-and-slipper dance at New Haven.\\" **\\"A Short Trip Home\\", Saturday Evening Post, January 17, 1927. \\"Joe Jelke and two other boys were along, and none of the three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me.

She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming‚Äîthat she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside.

On 26 August 1914 at Le Cateau, France, when a captain (Douglas Reynolds) of the same battery was trying to save two guns which had been recaptured, Driver Luke and another driver (Job Henry Charles Drain) volunteered to help and gave great assistance in the eventual saving of one of the guns. At the time they were under heavy fire from the enemy who were only away. He later achieved the rank of sergeant and served during World War II as a ground gunner with the Royal Air Force. Fred Luke was a guest of honour of 93 Le cateau Field Battery shortly before his death when members of the battery were awed to meet this living legend. Gnrs Raymond Pulman and Peter Jackson formed a special guard of honour on that proud day. For a number of years until his death on 12 March 1983, Frederick Luke was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest living holder of the Victoria Cross.

It entered into force on 30 October 2001. As of March 2014, it has 47 parties‚Äî46 states and the European Union. All of the ratifying states are in Europe and Central Asia. The EU has begun applying Aarhus-type principles in its legislation, notably the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). Liechtenstein and Monaco have signed the convention but have not ratified it. The Aarhus Convention grants the public rights regarding access to information, public participation and access to justice, in governmental decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.  Content  The Aarhus Convention is a multilateral environmental agreement through which the opportunities for citizens to access environmental information are increased and transparent and reliable regulation procedure is secured. It is a way of enhancing the environmental governance network, introducing a reactive and trustworthy relationship between civil society and governments and adding the novelty of a mechanism created to empower the value of public participation in the decision making process and guarantee access to justice: a \\"governance-by-disclosure\\" that leads a shift toward an environmentally responsible society.Aarti, 2008, p.2 The Aarhus Convention was drafted by governments, with the highly required participation of NGOs, and is legally binding for all the States who ratified it becoming Parties. Among the latter is included the EC, who therefore has the task to ensure compliance not only within the member States but also for its institutions, all those bodies who carry out public administrative duties.Rodehoff, 2003, p.350 Each Party has the commitment to promote the principles contained in the convention and to fill out a national report, always embracing a consultative and transparent process = General features = The Aarhus Convention is a rights-based approach: the public, both in the present and in future generations, have the right to know and to live in a healthy environment. A distinction is made between \\"the public\\", all the civil society's actors, and the \\"public concerned\\" precisely, those persons or organisations affected or interested in environmental decision-making (e.g. environmental NGOs). \\"Public authorities\\" are the addressees of the convention, namely, governments, international institutions, and privatized bodies that have public responsibilities or act under the control of public bodies. The private sector, for which information disclosure depends on voluntary, non- mandatory practices, and bodies acting in a judicial or legislative capacity, are excluded.Rodenhoff, 2003, p. 345 Other significant provisions are the \\"non-discrimination\\" principle (all the information has to be provided without taking account of the nationality or citizenship of the applicant), the international nature of the convention, and the importance attributed to the promotion of environmental education of the public. = The Three Pillars = # Access to information: any citizen should have the right to get a wide and easy access to environmental information. Public authorities must provide all the information required and collect and disseminate them and in a timely and transparent manner. They can refuse to do it only under particular situations (such as national defence);Rodenhoff, 2003, p.345 UNECE, 2006 # Public participation in decision making: the public must be informed over all the relevant projects and it has to have the chance to participate during the decision-making and legislative process. Decision makers can take advantage from people's knowledge and expertise; this contribution is a strong opportunity to improve the quality of the environmental decisions, outcomes and to guarantee procedural legitimacy Rodenhoff, 2003, p.346UNECE, 2006 # Access to justice: the public has the right to judicial or administrative recourse procedures in case a Party violates or fails to adhere to environmental law and the convention's principles.Rodehoff, 2003, p.348 = Further reflections = The Aarhus convention is a \\"proceduralisation of the environmental regulation\\",Aarti, 2008, p.3-4 it focuses more on setting and listing procedures rather than establishing standards and specifying outcomes, permitting the parties involved to interpret and implement the convention on the systems and circumstances that characterize their nation. This model embodies a perfect example of a multi-level governance. The risk could lay in a loss of time and resources that could be otherwise invested in defining the outcomes,Aarti, 2008, p. 4 notwithstanding the fact that it renders the convention vague, weak and open to multiple interpretations.Lee, M.; Abbot, C., 2003, p. 100 Other critiques note the fact that private bodies are excluded from the mandatory procedures (Mason, 2010), and that, moreover, it can also be debated whether the NGOs involved are faithfully representing environmental interests,Lee, M.; Abbot, C., 2003, p.89 ordinary citizens often do not have the financial means to participate effectively and are therefore have no choice but to be represented by these larger organisations. The relative differences between the participants and social groups' resource inequalities also suggests the possibility for irregular and imbalanced environmental protection.Bell, 2004 = Compliance Committee = The Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee was established to fulfill the requirement of Article 15 of the Convention on review of compliance to establish arrangements for reviewing compliance with the Convention. The Convention has a unique Compliance Review Mechanism, which can be triggered in four ways: # a Party makes a submission concerning its own compliance, # a Party makes a submission concerning another Party's compliance, # the Convention Secretariat makes a referral to the Committee, or # a member of the public makes a communication concerning the compliance of a Party. The Compliance mechanism is unique in international environmental law, as it allows members of the public to communicate concerns about a Party's compliance directly to a committee of international legal experts empowered to examine the merits of the case (the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee). Nonetheless, the Compliance Committee cannot issue binding decisions, but rather makes recommendations to the full Meeting of the Parties (MoP). However, in practise, as MoPs occur infrequently, Parties attempt to comply with the recommendations of the Compliance Committee. As of August 2009, 41 communication from the public ‚Äì many originating with non-governmental organizations ‚Äì and one submission from a Party had been lodged with the Convention's Compliance Committee. = Pollutant Release Protocol = The Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers to the Aarhus Convention was adopted at an extraordinary meeting of the Parties on 21 May 2003, in Kiev, Ukraine. 36 States and the European Community signed the Protocol. As of May 2016, 34 states plus the European Union have ratified the Protocol. The Kiev Protocol is the first legally binding international instrument on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs). PRTRs are inventories of pollution from industrial sites and other sources such as agriculture and transport. The objective of the Protocol is \\"to enhance public access to information through the establishment of coherent, nationwide pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs).\\" The Protocol places indirect obligations on private enterprises to report annually to their national governments on their releases and transfers of pollutants. Parties to the Protocol need not be Parties to the Convention. The Protocol is in this sense a free-standing, international agreement. The Kiev Protocol on PRTRs will enter into force 90 days after the sixteenth State ratifies or accedes to the agreement. An amendment to the Aarhus Convention on \\"Public Participation in Decisions on Deliberate Release into the Environment and Placing on the Market of Genetically Modified Organisms\\" was adopted at the Second Meeting of the Parties on 27 May 2005, in Almaty, Kazakhstan. As of August 2009, it had been ratified by 21 countries. The GMO amendment will enter into force 90 days after at least three-quarters of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention ratify it. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan (1997‚Äì2006) has said, \\"Although regional in scope, the significance of the Aarhus Convention is global. It is by far the most impressive elaboration of principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, which stresses the need for citizens' participation in environmental issues and for access to information on the environment held by public authorities. As such it is the most ambitious venture in the area of environmental democracy so far undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations.\\" The influence of the Aarhus Convention also extends beyond the environmental field. At the 2nd Internet Governance Forum, held on 12‚Äì15 May 2007, in Rio de Janeiro, the Convention was presented as a model of public participation and transparency in the operation of international forums.

The first series of 6 episodes was broadcast between 7 July and 11 August 1994. The second series, also of 6 episodes, was broadcast on Fridays at 20:30 (episodes 1 and 2) and 20:00 (episodes 3, 4 and 5) between 28 July and 1 September 1995, except for the last episode which was broadcast on Thursday 7 September at 22:45 (there was no episode shown on 11 August 1995). Overview The two had already appeared as a double act in The Mary Whitehouse Experience and Canned Carrott. Impressionists Alistair McGowan and Ronni Ancona were among the guests on the show. There were several character inventions in the sketches, such as \\"The Gullibles\\", who were always falling for scams, as well as a number of Punt and Dennis's characters from The Mary Whitehouse Experience, such as the milk- obsessed \\"Mr Strange\\". There were also spoofs from TV programmes such as Baywatch and The X-Files. The second series also featured performances by tribute bands; these included Bj√∂rn Again in episode 1; The Bootleg Beatles in episode 2; The Counterfeit Stones in episode 3; The LA Doors in episode 4; The Royal Family (a Queen tribute band) in episode 5; and T.Rextasy (a T. Rex tribute band) in episode 6. Characters The show featured a mix of stand- up, spoofs of known television series, but also a number of character based sketches. These characters and sketches included: * Mr Strange a man obsessed with milk and disgusting things to do with it. He briefly informs us of his latest 'experiment' and usually signs off with his catchphrase \\"milky-milky\\". (played by Hugh Dennis) * Norris Employed by the BBC as a weatherman as part of a home-office scheme to help rehabilitate habitual criminals, Norris' forecasts feature advice to take advantage of specific weather conditions to break into peoples homes and \\"get yourself something nice!\\". (Hugh Dennis, Series 2) * Kurt Wenker a living stereotype of the buff, tanned, German guy in charge of handing out the windsurf boards in holiday destinations. Kurt constantly intimidates British male tourists and jokes about stealing their girlfriends. (Hugh Dennis) * World of Wine and World of Whiskey. A programme presented by a man called Tarquin (Punt) and alcoholic wine connoisseur Michael (Dennis). Tarquin attempts to maintain the pomp and circumstance of presenting a professional programme about wines and spirits while Michael, slurs his way through viewers Q&A; sessions criticising their attempts to do anything with wine other than drink it. * Update With Tony Shannon and Ian Pye News anchors Tony Shannon (Dennis) and Ian Pye (Punt), who constantly introduce each other and the news headlines without ever actually reading any news. * The Rt. Hon. Hector Sleazely MP A member of parliament who is constantly in the middle of a scandal and attempts to explain himself in a statement to reporters. The statement is laced with word play, mostly homonyms, to the point where the long speech is generally meaningless. Sleazely always ends with his insistence that he will not be resigning before awkwardly resigning from making the statement. (Hugh Dennis) *Do you Fancy a Bit of a Brew? A lazy, dishonest tradesman (Dennis) who is always caught having a cup of tea, mainly because that is all he does. Any building work he does is usually shoddy and dangerous. *Any Way you Want It Two sketches (the first is in a fast food restaurant, the other in a garage) featuring the same two characters, one of whom (Gary - Dennis) is not very bright. These two characters first appeared in Canned Carrott. *The Jockeys Two jockeys sitting in a pub either discussing their races as racing commentators would (i.e. rather quickly), or referring to pint-sized personalities like Prince or Ronnie Corbett as 'big men' - referring to the fact that jockeys are typically very short people. *Martin An alcoholic, chain-smoking hit-man (Dennis) who been asked to do one last job supposedly to take out an assassin (McGowan), but has actually been duped by Dane (Punt) as he is incompetent and supposedly bound to get the job wrong. *Embarrassing Dad A father (Dennis) embarrasses his children by tactlessly telling one of his daughter's teachers that she fancies him, or ordering food in McDonald's and eating the packaging only to make matters worse by saying 'No-one's watching!'.

History After leaving Deep Purple in June 1973, Ian Gillan had retired from the music business to pursue other business ventures, including motorcycle engines, a country hotel / restaurant (with a guitar shaped swimming pool), and ownership of the Kingsway Recorders studio, where from April 1974 he began to work on his first post-Deep Purple solo tracks. These ventures, apart from the recording studio, all ended in failure. This fact, combined with a warm reception to his guest appearance at Roger Glover's Butterfly Ball live show at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 16 October 1975 (he sang \\"Sitting in a Dream\\" as a substitute for Ronnie James Dio, who was banned by Ritchie Blackmore to take part in it) prompted him to resume a singing career and form a new band. Initially called Shand Grenade, a combination of Shangri-la and Grenade, Gillan was persuaded by the management to change the band's name to the Ian Gillan Band. He recruited guitarist Ray Fenwick, bass player John Gustafson, keyboard player Mike Moran and Elf percussionist Mark Nauseef on drums. Using Roger Glover as producer and session musician, this line-up recorded their first album Child In Time in December 1975 / January 1976. In February 1976 Moran was replaced by Mickey Lee Soule (ex-Elf and Rainbow), but for the recording of follow-up album Clear Air Turbulence he was dropped in May 1976 in favour of Colin Towns. The band had some success in Japan but none at all in North America and only cult status in Europe, their jazz fusion direction unappealing to pop and rock fans alike. Their first album, Child In Time, reached 55 on the UK charts and 36 in Sweden. Their third album, Scarabus (1977), had more of a rock sound but retained the jazz fusion direction. Released at the height of punk rock, there was no success beyond Japan and their label Island Records dropped them. The following year Gillan dissolved the band but retained Colin Towns and formed a new band called simply Gillan. A live album was released after the breakup. John Gustafson said: \\"Gillan decided he didn‚Äôt like the band‚Äôs direction and wanted to do more rock stuff. In reality, he should have put his foot down a lot earlier. I personally was expecting Deep Purple stuff, but he let us do whatever we wanted.\\" Members =Ian Gillan Band= *Ian Gillan ‚Äì vocals (1975‚Äì1978) *Ray Fenwick ‚Äì guitars (1975‚Äì1978) *John Gustafson ‚Äì bass guitar (1975‚Äì1978) *Mark Nauseef ‚Äì drums (1975‚Äì1978) *Mike Moran ‚Äì keyboards (1975‚Äì1976) *Mickey Lee Soule ‚Äì keyboards (1976) *Colin Towns ‚Äì keyboards (1976‚Äì1978) =Gillan= *Ian Gillan ‚Äì vocals (1978‚Äì1983) *Colin Towns ‚Äì keyboards (1978‚Äì1983) *John McCoy ‚Äì bass guitar (1978‚Äì1983) *Steve Byrd ‚Äì guitars (1978‚Äì1979) *Bernie Torm√© ‚Äì guitars (1979‚Äì1981) *Janick Gers ‚Äì guitars (1981‚Äì1983) *Liam Genockey ‚Äì drums (1978) *Pete Barnacle ‚Äì drums (1979) *Mick Underwood ‚Äì drums (1979‚Äì1983) =Timeline= ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:25 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1975 till:01/12/1982 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1975 ScaleMinor = increment:2 start:1976 Colors = id:Band value:yellow legend:Band id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitars value:green legend:Guitars id:Keyboards value:purple legend:Keyboards id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Lines value:black legend:Studio_releases LineData = at:11/07/1976 color:black layer:back at:15/04/1977 color:black layer:back at:17/10/1977 color:black layer:back at:11/09/1978 color:black layer:back at:19/10/1979 color:black layer:back at:10/10/1980 color:black layer:back at:06/04/1981 color:black layer:back at:15/10/1981 color:black layer:back at:12/10/1982 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:IGBand text:\\"Ian Gillan Band\\" bar:Gillan text:\\"Gillan\\" bar:IGillan text:\\"Ian Gillan\\" bar:Fenwick text:\\"Ray Fenwick\\" bar:Byrd text:\\"Steve Byrd\\" bar:Torm√© text:\\"Bernie Torm√©\\" bar:Gers text:\\"Janick Gers\\" bar:Moran text:\\"Mike Moran\\" bar:Soule text:\\"Mickey Lee Soule\\" bar:Towns text:\\"Colin Towns\\" bar:Gustafson text:\\"John Gustafson\\" bar:McCoy text:\\"John McCoy\\" bar:Nauseef text:\\"Mark Nauseef\\" bar:Genockey text:\\"Liam Genockey\\" bar:Barnacle text:\\"Pete Barnacle\\" bar:Underwood text:\\"Mick Underwood\\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:IGBand from:start till:01/01/1978 color:Band bar:Gillan from:01/01/1978 till:end color:Band bar:IGillan from:start till:end color:Vocals bar:Fenwick from:start till:01/01/1978 color:Guitars bar:Byrd from:01/01/1978 till:01/07/1979 color:Guitars bar:Torm√© from:01/07/1979 till:01/07/1981 color:Guitars bar:Gers from:01/07/1981 till:end color:Guitars bar:Moran from:start till:01/02/1976 color:Keyboards bar:Soule from:01/02/1976 till:01/10/1976 color:Keyboards bar:Towns from:01/10/1976 till:end color:Keyboards bar:Gustafson from:start till:01/01/1978 color:Bass bar:McCoy from:01/01/1978 till:end color:Bass bar:Nauseef from:start till:01/01/1978 color:Drums bar:Genockey from:01/01/1978 till:01/09/1978 color:Drums bar:Barnacle from:01/09/1978 till:01/07/1979 color:Drums bar:Underwood from:01/07/1979 till:end color:Drums Discography =Studio albums= * Child in Time (1976, Oyster) * Clear Air Turbulence (1977, Island) * Scarabus (1977, Virgin Records) =Live albums= * Live at the Budokan (1977, Eastworld) * Live: Yubin Chokin Hall, Hiroshima (2001, Angel Air) * Live at the Rainbow 1977 (2002, Angel Air) =Compilation albums= * Anthology (2002) * Rarities 1975‚Äì1977, (2003) =Singles= * \\"You Make Me Feel So Good\\" / \\"Shame\\" (1976) * \\"Twin Exhausted / Five Moons\\" (1977) * \\"Country Lights / Poor Boy Hero\\" (1977) * \\"Mad Elaine\\" / \\"Mercury High\\" (1978) * \\"Smoke on the Water\\" / \\"Mad Elaine\\" (1978) - live References =Sources= =Citations= English progressive rock groups Musical groups established in 1975 Musical groups disestablished in 1978 Ian Gillan ","title":"Ian Gillan Band"},{"id":"1219545","text":"Duncan Charles Home VC (10 June 18281 October 1857) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

The 74th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees defeated the Dodgers four games to two to win the franchise's 21st World Series championship, their first since 1962, and the first under the ownership of George Steinbrenner. Played from October 11 to 18, the Series was televised on ABC. During this Series, Reggie Jackson earned his nickname \\"Mr. October\\" for his heroics. Billy Martin won what would be his only World Series title as a manager after guiding the Yankees to a second straight pennant. Route to the series =New York Yankees= The Yankees signed free agent Reggie Jackson before the 1977 season. The New York Yankees returned to the World Series after being swept by the Cincinnati Reds the previous year. In free agency, the Yankees signed slugging right fielder Reggie Jackson for US$2.96 million ($ in current dollar terms) over five years and Cincinnati Reds ace pitcher Don Gullett for $2 million ($ in current dollar terms) over six years. Two other key players were acquired by the Yankees through trades. Shortstop Bucky Dent was picked up from the Chicago White Sox for outfielder Oscar Gamble, pitcher LaMarr Hoyt, and $200,000. After only one year with the Oakland Athletics, pitcher Mike Torrez was acquired in exchange for pitcher Dock Ellis and utilitymen Marty Perez and Larry Murray. After a lackluster first half, the Yankees finished strong, winning 38 of their last 51 games, edging both the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles by games. Among the star-laden lineup was an emerging superstar, Ron Guidry. Early in the season Guidry was moved from the bullpen into the starting rotation, finishing 16-7 with a 2.82 ERA. The Yankees advanced to the World Series after beating the Kansas City Royals in an exciting fifth and final 1977 American League Championship Series (ALCS) game, winning it with three runs in the top of the ninth on a string of singles and a costly error by George Brett. =Los Angeles Dodgers= The National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers were managed by Tommy Lasorda, who was in his first full season as manager. The 1977 Dodgers became the first team to have four players hit 30 or more home runs in one season, as Steve Garvey hit 33, Reggie Smith hit 32, Ron Cey hit 30, and Dusty Baker hit 30. The pitching staff, which led the National League in ERA, 3.22, were led by 20-game winner Tommy John and closer Charlie Hough with 22 saves. The Dodgers won 22 of their first 26 games, winning the Western Division by 10 games over the Cincinnati Reds, then eliminated the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1977 National League Championship Series (NLCS) in four games. =Series preview= The matchup of the Yankees and the Dodgers harkened back to the \\"Subway Series\\" matchups between the two teams of the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams had met in eight previous World Series, with the Yankees winning in 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, and 1956 and the Dodgers in 1955 and 1963. The 1963 series was their first meeting after the Dodgers had moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958. This was the first World Series in which the ceremonial first pitches were from the mound instead of from the Commissioner's box, although this did not become permanent until 1989. Series statistics =Summary= Matchups =Game 1= The Dodgers scored twice in the top of the first inning, when Davey Lopes walked and scored on a Bill Russell triple off Don Gullett. Ron Cey made it 2‚Äì0 on a sacrifice fly. In the bottom of the inning, the Yankees responded with consecutive two-out singles by Thurman Munson, Reggie Jackson, and Chris Chambliss, scoring Munson. In the top of the sixth inning, Steve Garvey beat out a bunt and, with two out, attempted to score from first on a hit-and-run single to center field by Glenn Burke. Mickey Rivers, who did not possess a strong throwing arm, threw home. Replays showed Garvey clearly beat the tag but he was called out at the plate. The Yankees tied it in their half of the sixth inning when Willie Randolph hit a home run off Don Sutton. The Yankees took the lead in the eighth inning when Munson doubled home Randolph. Later in the inning, the Yankees loaded the bases with one out, but Dodger reliever El√≠as Sosa struck out Lou Piniella and retired Bucky Dent on a forceout to end the threat. The Dodgers tied it at 3‚Äì3 in the ninth inning Dusty Baker led off with a single and was almost picked off first when pinch-hitter Manny Mota failed on a bunt attempt. Mota flied out, but Steve Yeager walked and pinch- hitter Lee Lacy drove Baker home with a single. In extra innings, the Yankees got their leadoff hitters on in both the tenth and eleventh innings but did not score due to failure to lay down sacrifice bunts. Finally, in the 12th, Randolph led off and doubled and Munson was walked intentionally. Yankee manager Billy Martin at first wanted Paul Blair, the next hitter, to try to sacrifice again, but after two failed attempts, Martin had Blair hit away and Blair singled home Randolph with the game-winner. 1977 AL Cy Young award winner Sparky Lyle took the win in Game 1 and, coupled with his wins in Games 4 and 5 of the 1977 ALCS, is the only pitcher to win three consecutive decisions in a single postseason. =Game 2= With aces Ron Guidry and Mike Torrez having both pitched in Game 5 of the ALCS, Billy Martin was forced to use a sore-shouldered Catfish Hunter in Game 2. The Dodgers hit three homers in the first three innings off Hunter, as Ron Cey hit a two-run home run in the first, Steve Yeager a home run in the second, and Reggie Smith a two-run home run in the third. Steve Garvey hit a home run in the ninth off of Sparky Lyle. Burt Hooton pitched a five-hit complete game, allowing only run one in the fourth on Reggie Jackson's ground ball double play after Willie Randolph and Thurman Munson led off the inning with back-to-back singles. Hooton made amends for his meltdown in Game 3 of the 1977 NLCS. About an hour before the first pitch, a fire had started in Public School 3, an abandoned elementary school a few blocks east of Yankee Stadium. During the game, ABC cut to a helicopter camera for an overhead view of Yankee Stadium and the surrounding neighborhood, catching the fire. Howard Cosell announced, \\"There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning.\\" This became the title for a book and television miniseries focusing on the year 1977 in New York City. =Game 3= The Yankees struck for three runs in the first off Tommy John. Mickey Rivers led off with a bloop double to right (his first hit of the series) and scored on a harder-hit Thurman Munson double to right. Reggie Jackson singled to left to score Munson and went to second when Dodger left fielder Dusty Baker overran the ball. Lou Piniella then scored Jackson on an RBI single up the middle to make it 3‚Äì0. Baker atoned for his first-inning error by hitting a three-run homer in the third off Yankee starter Mike Torrez. The Yankees regained the lead with single runs in the fourth and fifth on an RBI groundout by Rivers, who finished the game with three hits (including two doubles), and an RBI single by Chris Chambliss. Torrez then shut out the Dodgers for the rest of the way. Torrez finished with nine strikeouts in the complete-game win. Before the game, a moment of silence was held in memory of entertainer and former Pittsburgh Pirates co-owner Bing Crosby, who died earlier that day.  National anthem  Before the game, Linda Ronstadt sang the national anthem, standing alone in center field wearing jeans and a Dodgers warmup jacket. The attire drew much media attention afterwards. The performance itself was later ranked by the Washington Examiner as the second-best national anthem rendition at a sporting event; according to the magazine, \\"it was such a hit Ronstadt wore a similar satin jacket ‚Äî along with short shorts, kneepads and roller skates ‚Äî on the cover of her 1978 album, Living in the USA.\\" =Game 4= With Don Sutton needing another day of rest, Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda started left-hander Doug Rau to counter the Yankees' left-handed power. Rau was rusty, having only pitched in relief in one game of the 1977 NLCS. After a relatively easy first inning, Reggie Jackson hit a leadoff double in the second. Lou Piniella singled Jackson home with the first run and was doubled to third by Chris Chambliss. Lasorda then pulled Rau in favor of Rick Rhoden, resulting in a heated argument between Lasorda and Rau on the mound.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9pxdNerOok At that point, Rau had given up four hits, including three to left-handed hitters. The Yankees scored two more runs in the inning on an RBI groundout by Graig Nettles and an RBI single by Bucky Dent. The Dodgers scored twice in the third. Rhoden, a good hitting pitcher, hit a ground-rule double to left, and Davey Lopes followed with a two-run homer off Yankee starter Ron Guidry. The Dodgers scored nothing else off Guidry, as he pitched a four-hit complete game. The Dodgers almost tied the game in the fourth when Ron Cey sent a drive to deep left that Lou Piniella leaped up and caught. Jackson ended the scoring with an opposite- field home run off Rhoden in the sixth inning. =Game 5= The Dodgers needed a win to send the Series back to New York. Davey Lopes led off the first with a triple and came home when Bill Russell singled. In the fourth, the Dodgers had an RBI single by Dusty Baker and a three-run homer by Steve Yeager. Baker added another RBI single in the fifth, Lee Lacy singled home a run, and Yeager batted in another run with a sacrifice fly. Reggie Smith completed the scoring with a two-run homer in the sixth inning. The Yankees scored two runs each in the seventh and eighth; the two runs in the eighth coming on back-to-back homers by Thurman Munson and Reggie Jackson. Nevertheless, Dodger starting pitcher Don Sutton pitched a complete game for the win. Jackson's shot in the eighth came on the first pitch from Sutton, setting the stage for a memorable finale. =Game 6= Game 6, shifted the series back to New York, where 56,407 filled Yankee Stadium. After two infield ground outs by Davey Lopes and Bill Russell, Steve Garvey put the Dodgers on the board with a two-run triple down the right field line off Mike Torrez, scoring Reggie Smith and Ron Cey; both runs were unearned after shortstop Bucky Dent booted Smith's ground ball and Cey walked. New York tied it in the second as Chris Chambliss lifted a 2‚Äì1 pitch from starter Burt Hooton into the right center seats after Reggie Jackson walked on four pitches, but the next three batters went down in order. After Lopes and Russell grounded out again in the top of the third, Smith put Los Angeles up 3‚Äì2 with his third homer of the Series, pounding a 1‚Äì1 pitch well into the right center seats. Cey lined an infield hit to third, knocked down by Graig Nettles, but Garvey flew to center to end the threat. In the fourth, Dusty Baker flew out and Rick Monday singled to left. Catcher Steve Yeager pulled one over third base, but it kicked out to left fielder Lou Piniella, who gunned out Yeager at second, and Torrez struck out Hooton to strand Monday at third. In the bottom half, catcher Thurman Munson led off and singled to left. On the next pitch, Jackson turned on a fastball and put into the right field seats for a one-run Yankees' lead, which chased Hooton. With Elias Sosa pitching, Chambliss lifted a high fly to shallow left between Russell and Baker that fell for a double, then went to third on Nettles' ground out to second. Piniella made it 5‚Äì3 with an unchallenged sacrifice fly to left field. Dent walked and Torrez grounded out to shortstop to end the inning. In the fifth, Lopes flew out to left, Russell walked, and Smith grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. Mickey Rivers led off the bottom half with a single up the middle. Willie Randolph bunted, but Yeager pounced on it and forced out Rivers at second for a fielder's choice, and Munson hit a low fly to center for the second out. After a throw to first to keep Randolph close, Jackson connected on the first pitch off Sosa, a screaming low line drive into the right field seats to make the score 7‚Äì3. Los Angeles manager Tommy Lasorda brought in lefthander Doug Rau to face Chambliss, who grounded out to Garvey at first. Leading off the bottom of the eighth, Jackson strode to the plate, amid the chants of \\"REG-GIE, REG-GIE, REG-GIE!\\", and drove the first Charlie Hough knuckleball he saw into the center field \\"batter's eye\\" (empty blackened bleachers) for an 8‚Äì3 lead; he became the first to hit three home runs in a World Series game in 49 years, since Babe Ruth (in 1926 and 1928). With his Game 5 first-pitch homer (in the eighth) and his four-pitch walk in the second inning of Game 6, Jackson homered on his last four swings of the bat in the Series, each off a different Dodger pitcher. The last eight pitches delivered to Jackson in the Series were all productive for the Yankees‚Äîthe four-pitch walk in the second inning allowed him to score on the Chambliss homer. The Dodgers pushed across a run in the ninth, but Torrez pitched his second complete game win of the Series. It was the first six-game Series since 1959. Composite box score 1977 World Series (4‚Äì2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) This World Series is notable for being a six-game series in which the winning team was outscored. It happened previously in 1918 and 1959 and later in 1992, 1996, and 2003. Seven-game series winners were outscored in 1957, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1991, 1997, and 2002; (equaled in 2016 and 2017). With complete games pitched consecutively in Games 2 through 6 (all for the winning pitcher), this was the last World Series to be completed without a pitcher recording a save. Broadcasting The 1977 Series was the first World Series televised by the ABC network since 1949 and the first since television of the Series started in 1947 not to be televised, at least in part, by rival network NBC. NBC had been the exclusive television network of the Series from 1950 to 1976 and had covered that year's Yankees‚ÄìRoyals and Dodgers‚ÄìPhillies playoff series that year. As was customary at the time, the competing teams' local flagship stations (WPIX in New York and KTTV in Los Angeles) were allowed to air a simulcast of ABC's national broadcast. It was also the first time that the participating teams' local announcers were not featured during game play on the network telecast, though the Yankees' Bill White and the Dodgers' Ross Porter did pre-game TV features, and White handled the post-game celebration in the Yankee clubhouse after they won the title. White and Porter also split the CBS Radio play-by-play for the Series. Impact and aftermath This World Series cemented Jackson's legacy as a postseason performer, giving him the nickname \\"Mr. October\\". Twenty-four years later a similar nickname would be given to another Yankee, shortstop Derek Jeter, after a walk-off home run in Game 4 of the 2001 World Series. Jackson won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award and Babe Ruth Award. Lyle won the AL Cy Young Award. Nettles and Garvey both won Gold Glove Awards. The Yankees and Dodgers met again in the 1978 and 1981 World Series. Los Angeles became the first metropolitan area to host a World Series and a Super Bowl in the same calendar year. Super Bowl XI was played January 9, 1977 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. After the 1977 World Series, Melissa Ludtke, a reporter for Sports Illustrated, sued MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for having been denied access to the Yankees' clubhouse during the series, asserting that her 14th Amendment right was violated. Ludtke won her case. In popular culture The 1977 New York Yankees is one of the key plot points, along with the Son of Sam and the New York City Blackout of 1977, in the movie Summer of Sam directed by Spike Lee. The 1977 Yankees season, including the World Series, is one of the subjects of Jonathan Mahler's 2005 non-fiction book Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning, which was subsequently adapted into the 2007 ESPN mini-series The Bronx Is Burning.

It was founded in 1970 as the second English-language public college of Quebec's public college system, after Dawson College. Vanier is located just north of CEGEP Saint-Laurent, a French-language public college. Programs Vanier College offers over twenty-five programs of study in both two-year pre-university and three-year technical fields. With a student population averaging eight thousand, Vanier College is the second-largest English-language college in Qu√©bec. The college offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field in university. Students graduating from a college program are prepared more adequately for university studies. The technical programs, which take three years to complete, applies to students who wish to be career-ready; however, many students choose to pursue a university degree. In addition, the Continuing Education Centre offers a wide variety of credit courses and programs with flexible scheduling. =Pre- university programs= * Commerce * Communications: Art, Media, Theatre * Computer Science and Mathematics * Liberal Arts * Modern Languages * Modern Languages and Music Double DEC * Music * Pure and Applied Science * Health Science * Science and Music Double DEC * Science and Social Science Double DEC (Commerce Option) * Social Science * Social Science Majors (law and society, child studies, international studies,psychology,sports and leisure studies) * Social Science and Music Double DEC Usually, pre-university programs require four semesters (two years) to complete.

Each of its buildings was built at a different point in the college's history, and is identified by a letter of the alphabet. The land that the campus is located on today was first used for the Village de Saint-Laurent chapel, opened in 1817. Thirty years later, a convent, known as the Couvent Notre-Dame-des-Anges, was built nearby by the Sisters of Holy Cross (fr: S≈ìurs de Sainte- Croixhttp://www.soeursdesaintecroix.org/index.html). The original Convent building was later expanded into the building known as the \\"C building\\" today. In 1897, the sisters opened the first college on the campus land, on the location of today's \\"E building\\". That building was expanded in 1848 and 1857 to become today's \\"E building\\". In 1873, a chapel was built that connected the convent and college buildings. That chapel was a forerunner of today's \\"F building\\". The \\"B building\\" was a further expansion of the convent built on the north side of the \\"C building\\" in 1904. It was unclear exactly when the \\"D building\\" was built, but it appears to have been at around this same time. The \\"D building\\" connected to the rear (east side) of the original \\"F building\\" chapel. Originally, both the \\"D\\" and \\"E\\" buildings had elaborate balconies on every floor, which were removed in the 1970s. This is why several windows on both buildings today are taller than the rest of the windows in the building - these windows were doors to the balconies in the original building design. In 1911, the original Village de Saint-Laurent chapel was demolished, to be replaced by a new school for young girls, Acad√©mie Saint-Alfred. The cupola at the top of the new building was designed to reflect a similar cupola on the original chapel building. This new building eventually became Vanier's \\"H building\\". In 1933, the Sisters opened the yet another college, Coll√®ge Basile-Moreau, within the existing convent buildings. This soon required further expansions to the campus. In the 1940s, the \\"A building\\" was built at the north end of the \\"B building\\". In the 1950s, the original \\"F building\\" chapel was demolished and replaced with the building that stands as the \\"F building\\" today. In 1967, several institutions were merged and became public ones, when the Quebec system of CEGEPs was created. = Since becoming Vanier (1970-present) = A view of the campus In 1970, the Quebec government purchased the entire property and it was re-opened as Vanier College, Quebec's second English language public college (after Dawson College that had opened the year previous). Enrollment in its first year was approximately 1,400 students. *Even though the library has three floors, it can only be entered via its first floor. *The oldest of the main building sections is the \\"E building\\". *It has been agreed upon that getting from any one room to another takes under ten minutes, within the boundaries of the campus.

The 73rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Cincinnati Reds and the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees. The Reds swept the Series in four games to repeat as champions, avenging their 1939 and 1961 World Series losses to the Yankees. The 1976 Reds became, and remain, the only team to sweep an entire multi-tier postseason, one of the crowning achievements of the franchise's Big Red Machine era. The Reds are also the last NL team to win back-to-back World Series. It also marked the second time that the Yankees were swept in a World Series‚Äîthe Los Angeles Dodgers were the first to sweep them in 1963. The Reds won the NL West division by 10 games over the Dodgers, then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, three games to none, in the NL Championship Series after losing seven of 12 games to the Phillies during the regular season. The Yankees won the AL East division by games over the Baltimore Orioles, then defeated the Kansas City Royals, three games to two, in the AL Championship Series. This World Series was the first in which the designated hitter rule, which had been introduced in the AL three years prior, was in effect; it was used for all games (for the first 10 years, the use of the DH alternated; in even-numbered years, it was used in all games, in odd-numbered years, it was not used; starting in 1986, the DH would be used only in games played at the AL representative's park). The use of the DH wound up benefiting the Reds, who were able to get utility infielder Dan Driessen's bat in the lineup. Driessen hit .357 with one home run. Elliott Maddox, Carlos May, and Lou Piniella shared the role for the Yankees. Game 1, played at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, marked the first time the DH was used in a NL ballpark. Game 2, also at Riverfront Stadium, was the first World Series weekend game to be scheduled at night. Background After spending the last two years sharing home field with the New York Mets at Shea Stadium, the 1976 New York Yankees returned home to a rebuilt and modified Yankee Stadium. George Steinbrenner had now owned the team for four years, since 1973, with Billy Martin serving the first of his five stints as manager since 1975. General Manager Gabe Paul made numerous trades getting Mickey Rivers and Ed Figueroa from the Angels for Bobby Bonds; Willie Randolph and Dock Ellis from the Pirates for Doc Medich; and Doyle Alexander, Ken Holtzman, and Grant Jackson from the Orioles for Rudy May, Tippy Martinez, Scott McGregor, and Rick Dempsey. The heart of the team was Yankee captain, Thurman Munson, whose grit and determination were factors in his winning the 1976 American League MVP award. Third baseman, Graig Nettles, and first baseman, Chris Chambliss were the key run producers, while speedy outfielders Roy White and Rivers set the table for the power hitters. Super free agent Catfish Hunter headed the staff while reliever Sparky Lyle led the A.L. in saves with 23. The Yankees finished ahead in the A.L. East advancing to the World Series by beating the Kansas City Royals in the fifth game of the playoffs on a ninth-inning walk- off home run by Chambliss. The defending champion Cincinnati Reds were piloted by Sparky Anderson who had a star-studded lineup led by second baseman Joe Morgan. Catcher Johnny Bench, first baseman Tony P√©rez, and outfielder George Foster provided enough power to drive in sparkplugs, Pete Rose, Ken Griffey and Morgan, who combined power (27 homers, 111 RBI) and speed (67 stolen bases) from the third-spot in the batting order. Morgan went on to win his second-straight National League Most Valuable Player award, outdistancing runner-up teammate Foster. But Foster would go on to win the 1977 MVP award, giving the Reds six MVPs in an eight-year stretch. Bench won MVP honors in 1970 and 1972 while Rose took home the hardware in '73. The Reds led the NL in every significant offensive category including runs scored, batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, doubles, triples, home runs, RBI and stolen bases. On the mound, the Reds relied on left-handers Don Gullett and Fred Norman to pacify the Yankee hitters in Games 1 and 2, respectively. Gullett had come back from a mid-season injury to start Game 1 but had to leave the game in the eighth inning due to a twisted ankle while Norman out- pitched ace Hunter in Game 2. Game 3 in New York pitted effective 1976 NL Rookie of the Year Pat Zachry for the Reds against newly acquired Yankee, Dock Ellis. Ellis only lasted innings, exiting in the fourth after a home run by Driessen. Game 4 was delayed a day due to rain, but the Reds were ready for the sweep. Bench's two-run home run gave the Reds a 3‚Äì1 lead. In the top of the ninth, a frustrated Billy Martin threw a baseball from the dugout onto the field towards home plate umpire Bill Deegan, causing his ejection from the game. In the ninth, Bench's second home run followed by back-to-back doubles by C√©sar Ger√≥nimo and Dave Concepci√≥n made the score 7‚Äì2 and essentially blew the game open. The Cincinnati Reds outscored the New York Yankees, 22‚Äì8, and became the first NL team to repeat as World Champions since the 1921‚Äì1922 New York Giants. The Reds did not make a single offensive or defensive substitution (save pitching changes) during the entire series. Bench would claim the MVP of the series hitting .533 with two home runs and six runs batted in. His catching counterpart, Thurman Munson, had nine hits, all singles, and a .529 batting average. Summary ‚Ä†: postponed from October 20 due to rain Matchups =Game 1= Joe Morgan Joe Morgan got the Reds off to a booming start with a home run in the first off of Doyle Alexander, who had to start because Catfish Hunter had a sore arm and needed another day of rest. The Yankees tied the game in the second when Lou Piniella hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Graig Nettles's sacrifice fly. In the third, Dave Concepcion tripled with one out and scored on Pete Rose's sacrifice fly to put the Reds up 2‚Äì1. Tony P√©rez's RBI single in the sixth extended their lead to 3‚Äì1. In the seventh, George Foster hit a leadoff single and scored on a Johnny Bench RBI triple. Bench then scored on a Sparky Lyle wild pitch. The only bad news for the Reds was an injury to starting pitcher Don Gullett, who pulled a calf muscle in the eighth and would be unavailable for the remainder of the Series. It turned out to be Gullett's last appearance in a Reds uniform. Pedro Borbon pitched shutout innings to close the game. =Game 2= Tony Perez The Reds scored three runs in the second off Catfish Hunter. After a leadoff double by Dan Driessen, George Foster's RBI single put the Reds up 1‚Äì0. Foster was caught stealing second, but after a double and walk, Dave Concepci√≥n's RBI single made it 2‚Äì0 Reds. A walk loaded the bases before a sacrifice fly by Ken Griffey made it 3‚Äì0 Reds. The Yankees got on the board on an RBI single by Graig Nettles in the fourth. In the seventh, the Yankees tied things up on an RBI double by Fred Stanley off starter Fred Norman and an RBI groundout by Thurman Munson off Jack Billingham. Meanwhile, Hunter settled into a groove, pitching a complete game and shutting out the Reds until the ninth. With two outs, Ken Griffey reached second when Stanley threw wildly past first after fielding his slow bouncer. Joe Morgan was walked intentionally and Tony P√©rez ended the game by driving in Griffey with a single. The Sunday night contest, the first weekend World Series game to begin after dark, was played under temperatures that started at and dipped into the 30s as the game progressed. MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn responded to criticism of the scheduling, which was done to accommodate NBC television, by attending the game without wearing an overcoat in spite of the cold nighttime weather. =Game 3= George Foster As the Series moved to Yankee Stadium, the Reds struck first with three runs off starter Dock Ellis. Dan Driessen hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on an RBI double by George Foster, After Johnny Bench singled, an RBI force-out by C√©sar Ger√≥nimo made it 2‚Äì0 Reds. Geronimo stole second and scored on an RBI single by Dave Concepci√≥n to cap the inning's scoring. Dan Driessen smacked a home run in the fourth. In the bottom of the inning, the Yankees got on the board on Oscar Gamble's single off of Pat Zachry. A seventh inning home run by Jim Mason‚Äîthe 500th home run in the history of the World Series‚Äîcut the Reds' lead to 4‚Äì2. Mason became the first of two players to hit a home run in his only World Series at-bat, the second being Geoff Blum in 2005 for the Chicago White Sox. The Reds got both runs back in the eighth on Joe Morgan's RBI double off Grant Jackson after two leadoff singles and Foster's RBI single off Dick Tidrow. This was the first World Series game at Yankee Stadium to open with opera star Robert Merrill's famous rendition of the National Anthem. =Game 4= Johnny Bench The Yankees got on the board in the first (which would be their only lead in this Series) on a two-out Thurman Munson single and a Chris Chambliss double off of Gary Nolan. Munson would collect four hits in the game. In the fourth, Joe Morgan walked off of Ed Figueroa, stole second, and came home on a George Foster single. Johnny Bench followed with his first home run to give the Reds a 3‚Äì1 lead. The Yankees cut the lead to 3‚Äì2 in the fifth inning.when Mickey Rivers hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on Munson's single, but the Reds padded that lead in the ninth. Figueroa walked two before being relieved by Dick Tidrow, who allowed a one-out three-run home run to Bench to extend the Reds' lead to 6‚Äì2. C√©sar Ger√≥nimo and Dave Concepci√≥n followed with consecutive doubles to make 7‚Äì2 Reds. Will McEnaney pitched shutout innings to end the series. It was the Reds' second-straight World Series victory and the second-straight time McEnaney would be on the mound for the Series' final out. It also, to date, is the only perfect playoff season since the LCS was created in 1969. Composite box 1976 World Series (4‚Äì0): Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) beat New York Yankees (A.L.).

Biography Born on 15 December 1888 in Palpa, Nepal, to Haria Gulte. Thapa was a 26-year-old Rifleman in the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles, British Indian Army, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 25 September 1915 in Fauquissart, France Rifleman Kulbir Thapa, having been wounded himself, found a wounded soldier of The Leicestershire Regiment behind the first-line German trench (believed to be a 20-year-old soldier from Melton Mowbray by the name of Bill Keightley). Although urged to save himself, the Gurkha stayed with the wounded man all day and night. Early next day, in misty weather, he dragged him through the German wire, within spitting distance from the Germans, and, leaving him in a place of comparative safety, returned and brought in two wounded Gurkhas, one after the other. He then went back, and, in broad daylight, fetched the British soldier, carrying him most of the way under enemy fire. Such an incredible act of faith and courage had by now attracted a good deal of attention, and when he emerged from his trench for the third time with one more wounded comrade over his shoulder, the German soldiers actually clapped their hands to encourage the Gurkha on. Only this time, the Gurkha walked right across the No-Mans-Land back to his own side. The Victoria Cross awarded to Kulbir Thapa was in the first group of awards for the Battle of Loos which were gazetted on 18 November 1915. Of the 18 VCs gazetted that day no less than 17 were presented by the King at Buckingham Palace in nine presentations between December 1915 and January 1917. Kulbir Thapa rejoined his battalion in Egypt on 4 January 1916 and no record as to when he received his medal has been located.Victoria Cross presentations and locations.

It is said to have been founded by two fishermen where the rivers Danube (Donau) and W√∂rnitz meet. The city is part of the scenic route called \\"Romantische Stra√üe\\" (Romantic Road) The city is situated between Munich and Nuremberg, 46 km north of Augsburg. History Donauw√∂rth grew up in the course of the 11th and 12th centuries under the protection of the castle of Mangoldstein, became in the 13th century a seat of Duke Ludwig II of Bavaria, who, however, soon withdrew to Munich to escape from his wife, Duchess Maria of Brabant, whom he had there beheaded on an unfounded suspicion of infidelity. The town received the freedom of the Holy Roman Empire in 1308, and maintained its position in spite of the encroachments of Bavaria till 1607, when the interference of the Protestant inhabitants with the abbot of the Heilig-Kreuz called forth an imperial law authorizing the duke of Bavaria to punish them for the offence. It is historically important to Germany as the site of one of the incidents which led to the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). In 1606, the Lutheran majority barred the Catholic residents of the town from holding an annual Markus procession, causing a riot to break out. During the war, it was stormed by Gustavus Adolphus (1632) and captured by Ferdinand III (1634). Donauw√∂rth was later the scene of the Battle of Schellenberg (or Battle of Donauw√∂rth) on 2 July 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702‚Äì1713). The battle was named after the village and high ground behind the city. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, was marching from Flanders to Bavaria and came to the Danube. The French decided to make a crossing of the Danube at Donauw√∂rth, where they were surprised by Marlborough's troops and after heavy fighting pulled back. That allowed Marlborough to capture Donauw√∂rth and cross the Danube without any problem. About 5,000 French troops drowned while trying to escape. Another battle of Donauw√∂rth on 7 October 1805 opened Napoleon's Ulm Campaign.

Nunney was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in Hastings in East Sussex, he was sent to Canada as a home child. Nunney was one of the seven Canadians to be awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions on one single day, 2 September 1918, for actions across the 30 km long Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line near Arras, France. The other six were Bellenden Hutcheson, Arthur George Knight, William Henry Metcalf, Cyrus Wesley Peck, Walter Leigh Rayfield and John Francis Young. Early life Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney VC is buried in Aubigny Communal Cemetery Extension; he was born in Hastings as Stephen Sargent Claude Nunney. His father was William Percy Nunney and his mother Mary Nunney formerly Sargent at 42 Bexhill Road, Hastings on 19 July 1892. His father was born in Burford, Oxfordshire. Claude, as he was called within his family, was the fourth of eight children. The family left Hastings in 1895 and moved to Kentish Town, St Pancras, in London where his mother was to sadly die of food poisoning in February 1899. Two of Claude‚Äôs younger siblings died very young, and of the remaining six, five passed into the care of the Catholic Church. The three boys born in Hastings, Frederick George, Stephen Claude and Alfred Nunney all became \\"Home Children\\" in Canada. Alfred and Stephen Nunney travelled together aboard the SS Tunisian in October 1905 to Quebec and then on to St George‚Äôs Home at Hintonburg, Ottawa, Ontario. They were split up and sent to different families, Alfred moving to the Micksburg County, Renfrew, and Claude to North Lancaster. Alfred was just twelve, as he was born on 29 September 1893, and Claude thirteen when they went in their separate directions. Claude Nunney was placed with Mrs Donald Roy McDonald, where he lived and worked as a \\"Home Child\\". The term \\"Home Child\\" covered the young girls and boys sent as child emigrants by various agencies to Canada to start new lives. Unbeknown to Claude, his brother George Nunney, who came as a Home Child to Canada in October 1904, was drowned on the 19 July 1908 in the Jock River, Jockvale. This is around 150 kilometres from North Lancaster. He was aged only 17. He had also been born in Hastings on 27 December 1890. He had been placed with Patrick Houlahan, a local farmer. There has been some debate as to Nunney's origins. Whilst Nunney himself stated he was born in Dublin, Ireland, he was actually born in Hastings, England as Stephen Sargent Claude Nunney. Also it is claimed that Nunney did not become a Canadian citizen by naturalisation, but by becoming part of a child emigration scheme known as British Home Children. Dave Lorente (Homechildren Canada) wrote in an article on Claude: Victoria Cross Award Nunney was a member of the 38th (Ottawa) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force which is perpetuated by the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa (Duke of Edinburgh's Own). The Cameron Highlanders are a Canadian Forces Primary Reserve light infantry regiment located in the Cartier Square Drill Hall. Nunney was a private in the First World War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC: He died aged 25, 16 days after receiving what proved to be mortal wounds and was buried at Aubigny Communal Cemetery Extension, near Aubigny-en-Artois (Grave reference number IV. B. 39). The Medal All of Nunney's medals (he had earlier in the war won the Military Medal and the Distinguished Conduct Medal at the Battle of Vimy Ridge), including his VC are displayed above the fireplace at Cornwall Armoury in Cornwall, Ontario.

It may also be referred to as a T3 line. *The data rate for this type of signal is 44.736 Mbit/s (45 Mb). *DS3 uses 75ohm coaxial cable and BNC connectors. *This level of carrier can transport 28 DS1 level signals within its payload. *This level of carrier can transport 672 DS0 level channels within its payload. *Such circuits are the usual kind between telephony carriers, both wired and wireless, and typically by OC1 optical connections. Cabling DS3 interconnect cables must be made with true 75-ohm coaxial cable and connectors. Cables or connectors which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower the performance of the connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, Generic Requirements for Central Office Coaxial Cable, defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and cable stripping tools used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the most reliable 75 ohm connectors known. RG-6 or even inexpensive RG-59 cable may work temporarily when properly terminated, though it does not meet telephony technical standards.

During his service he was decorated four times for valorous service and saw action in several major campaigns before he was killed just months before the war's end in June 1918. Amongst his decorations was the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry to British or Commonwealth troops. He was also the first of seven British officers to be awarded the DSO four times in the First World War.

The 71st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion (and two-time defending World Series champion) Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Athletics won the series, four games to one. Rollie Fingers figured in three of the four Oakland victories, posting a win and two saves, and was honored with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. Oakland became the first team to win three consecutive Series since the New York Yankees won five in a row between 1949 and 1953; the win secured the Athletics' status as one of the truly dominant teams of the 1970s. (The other \\"team of the decade,\\" the Cincinnati Reds, would win the World Series in 1975 and 1976.) The 1974 World Series was the first all-California World Series. These two teams met again 14 years later in the 1988 World Series. Background The 1974 Los Angeles Dodgers were the second (after the runner- up 1962 squad) Dodger team to win at least 100 games since moving west from Brooklyn; they won the National League West division after a season long battle by four games over the Cincinnati Reds, then defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, three games to one, in the National League Championship Series. The Oakland A's won the American League West division by five games over the Texas Rangers, then defeated the Baltimore Orioles, three games to one, in the American League Championship Series. =Oakland A's= The Oakland A's, dynasty or not, had become something of a running joke in the American League, consistently matching their on-field heroics with locker-room meltdowns and intra-squad theatrics. After yet another banner year (Catfish Hunter won 25 games, Reggie Jackson knocked in 105 runs, and Billy North stole 54 bases), the team seemed to be winning more attention for its dysfunctional communication patterns than for its superior lineup. Hunter was threatening to file for free agency in 1975 if owner Charles O. Finley didn't come through with back pay Hunter claimed he had coming. Traumatized former second baseman Mike Andrews was considering legal action for the shabby treatment he received in the previous year's World Series. Teammates Rollie Fingers and Blue Moon Odom had gotten into a fistfight. And the Series-winning manager of the previous year, Dick Williams was long gone, having had one personality clash too many with the A's front office. Despite all the melodrama, the A's won the A.L. pennant for the third straight year, dispatching the Baltimore Orioles in a four-game ALCS. Notwithstanding the off-field troubles, between the lines they were fundamentally sound, had strong pitching, and combined speed and power. =Los Angeles Dodgers= L.A. won 102 games, boasted the best team ERA in the National League, and led their league in runs scored. Steve Garvey hit .312, Jimmy Wynn knocked in 108 runs, Bill Buckner hit .314 in one of the best years of his career, Davey Lopes stole 59 bases, Andy Messersmith won 20 games, and Don Sutton won 19. Walter Alston was in his 21st year as manager of the club Summary Matchups =Game 1= Reggie Jackson put the A's on the board first with a homer in the top of the second off 20-game winner Andy Messersmith. The A's added another run in the fifth when starting pitcher Ken Holtzman, batting for the first time all season because of the designated hitter rule, doubled to left, went to third on a Messersmith wild pitch, and scored on a Bert Campaneris suicide squeeze bunt. The Dodgers crept back with a run in their half of the fifth when Davey Lopes reached first on an error by shortstop Campaneris. Bill Buckner then bounced a single to right that Jackson misplayed, allowing Lopes to score. The A's scored their final run in the eighth when Campaneris singled to shallow center, was sacrificed to second by Bill North, and scored when Dodger third baseman Ron Cey threw wildly to first on a grounder hit by Sal Bando. Bando reached third on the error, and attempted to score on a flyout to right by Jackson, but right fielder Joe Ferguson gunned him down at the plate. In the bottom of the ninth, with Rollie Fingers on the mound, Jimmy Wynn hit a homer that just escaped the reach of Joe Rudi and North in left center. Following a single by Steve Garvey, Catfish Hunter relieved Fingers and made the final out by striking out Ferguson. Fingers got the win with innings of relief, having relieved Holtzman in the fifth inning . =Game 2= Don Sutton pitched superbly, shutting out the A's on four hits through eight innings. The Dodgers scored first in the second off Vida Blue when Ron Cey walked, Bill Russell singled, and Steve Yeager singled home Cey. Joe Ferguson slammed a two-run homer off Blue in the sixth inning to make it 3‚Äì0. The A's threatened in the eighth when pinch hitters Jim Holt and Claudell Washington hit back-to-back singles with one out. Bert Campaneris reached on an infield error to load the bases. The rally was squelched when Bill North hit into a double play in which first baseman Steve Garvey made an exceptional pickup of a low throw by Russell. In the ninth inning the A's finally got on the board when Sal Bando led off with being hit by a pitch, Reggie Jackson followed with a double, and Joe Rudi singled both runners home. Mike Marshall then relieved Sutton and struck out Gene Tenace. Herb Washington was sent in to pinch-run for Rudi, and Marshall picked him off. Herb Washington was the only \\"designated runner\\" to appear in a World Series. Washington was a track star with no baseball experience whom the A's Charles Finley signed solely to appear as a pinch runner in late game situations. His stats for 1974 were 92 games, zero at bats, 29 runs scored, 29 stolen bases, but he was caught stealing 16 times. Sure enough, with the A's trailing 3‚Äì2 in the ninth inning of Game 2, Washington pinch ran. Just after announcer Vin Scully said that Washington better be careful because pitcher Mike Marshall has a good pickoff move, he was promptly picked off first base. Marshall then retired √Ångel Mangual for the final out. =Game 3= With the Series shifting back to Oakland, it was A's ace Catfish Hunter's turn to be brilliant. Hunter shut out the Dodgers on four hits through seven innings, and his teammates provided him with two runs in the third when Bill North scored on an error by catcher Joe Ferguson and an RBI single by Joe Rudi. The A's added another run in the fourth on Bert Campaneris' RBI single. The Dodgers got their only runs on homers by Bill Buckner in the eighth and Willie Crawford in the ninth. Rollie Fingers was not awarded the save because in 1974, tougher criteria were adopted for saves where the tying run had to be on base or at the plate when the reliever entered to qualify for a save. =Game 4= The A's struck first on a solo homer by the surprising Ken Holtzman in the third. The Dodgers came right back in their half of the fourth on a two-run triple by Bill Russell. Holtzman settled into a groove after that, surrendering no runs before yielding to Rollie Fingers in the eighth. The A's took control of the game with four runs in the sixth off Andy Messersmith. Bill North led off with a walk and went to second on a wild pickoff throw by Messersmith. Sal Bando singled home North to tie it. After a Reggie Jackson walk, a Joe Rudi sacrifice bunt, and an intentional walk to Claudell Washington, Jim Holt pinch-hit for Ray Fosse and singled in two runs. An RBI groundout by Dick Green capped off the rally. Fingers pitched the final innings for his first save of the series. =Game 5= The A's staked Vida Blue to a 2‚Äì0 lead with single runs in the first and second innings on a sacrifice fly by Sal Bando and a homer by Ray Fosse. The Dodgers tied it in the sixth with two runs on a sacrifice fly by Jimmy Wynn and an RBI single by Steve Garvey. Joe Rudi got what would turn out to be the game-winning RBI when he tagged Dodger ace reliever Mike Marshall with a homer in the bottom of the seventh. The half- inning was delayed when Bill Buckner complained of A's fans throwing debris onto the field. Marshall, who always pitched in short sleeves, disdained his allowance of eight warm up pitches after coming in from the bullpen even after the delay. Rudi then proceeded to deposit Marshall's first pitch over the left field wall. In the Dodgers half of the eighth, Buckner led off with a base hit to center that got past center fielder Bill North. Buckner had an easy double, but tried to stretch it to a triple and Reggie Jackson, backing up North, fired a perfect throw to Dick Green, who relayed to Sal Bando at third to nail Buckner and squelch the last Dodger threat. Rollie Fingers got his second save and was named Series MVP. Aftermath Four of the five games had the score of 3‚Äì2, and in all five games the losing team scored two runs. Mike Marshall of the Los Angeles Dodgers was the only pitcher to appear in all five games of a five-game World Series, . The Dodgers got six more hits than the A's but scored five fewer runs, showing their lack of timely hitting. They also made six errors in five games, in addition to a number of mental errors. The A's won the Series despite batting only .211 in the Series, the lowest in a five- game Series since the Baltimore Orioles hit .146 in the 1969 Series. , the A's are the only non-Yankee team to win three consecutive World Series. This was the first World Series to end at night. This was the last major league championship for a Bay Area team won in its home stadium or arena until the Golden State Warriors won the 2017 NBA Finals in Oakland, ending a streak of 13 Bay Area championships won in an opponent or neutral stadium or arena. Also, with the Warriors winning the 1975 NBA Finals, Oakland (and the Bay Area in particular) won both the World Series and NBA championship in a span of a season or calendar year, a distinction previously earned by New York when the Mets and Knicks won their league championships within a year's span. This was followed by the Los Angeles metropolitan area in 1981‚Äì82 (Dodgers and Lakers), 1988 (Dodgers and Lakers) and 2002 (Angels and Lakers), Boston in 2007‚Äì08 (Red Sox and Celtics), and the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014‚Äì15 (Giants and Warriors).

An improved version, the SL45i, was also the first phone to have a Java virtual machine. In addition to the MP3 player, SL45 offered other advanced features such as dictaphone with several hours of recording time, auto responder, voice dialing and voice commands, WAP browser, and context sensitive help in several languages. Other software include calendar/organizer, alarm clock, stopwatch, calculator, currency converter and games. While SL45 was one of the most advanced phones in its time, it was also one of the smallest.  Versions  The Siemens SL45 came in three versions: * Siemens SL45 - original edition, with a 32 MB memory card, sync station and stereo headphones in the package * Siemens SL42 - a cheaper version introduced later, with a 16 MB memory card and no sync station or headphones * Siemens SL45i - a version with a new firmware with Java support, and a slightly stronger battery These three phones are electronically identical, and the SL45i's firmware can be installed in the SL42 and SL45, thus enhancing them with a Java virtual machine.

It was sometimes criticized for its bugginess, particularly in that simply sending too many SMSs could cause the phone to crash, and for being relatively delicate - there are many known issues of vibration alert, or MP3 player control buttons on the side of the case stopping functioning after phone fall.  Firmware  The SL42, SL45 and SL45i share the same electronic components, and thus firmware can be exchanged between them. It can enhance functionality of SL42 and SL45 with Java support. Relatively simple structure of the firmware code, and the ease of new firmware installation (standard serial cable included in the box is suitable) led to many custom firmware modifications (more than 300 patches) sprung over the Internet. These correct software bugs, change the phone's graphics, or even add new functionality like key remapping, calling pictures, or detailed battery information, and even up to 15 virtual SIM-cards (user must reboot phone to select virtual SIM from list).  User base  Due to the above-mentioned firmware enhanceability, availability of many Java applications further enhancing the feature set (with, for example, sending of long SMS messages, e-book reading, video playing, and E-mail client functionality), MP3 player functionality and memory card slot, and also for being fairly priced after a few years since its release, the SL45 series gained a huge user base, constantly developing new firmware patches, Java applications and hardware modifications, enhancing the phone's functionality. Many fans of the model claim that there is no mobile phone which can replace the SL45i (either the original one, or SL42/45 enhanced with SL45i firmware) for them. The phone is indeed very versatile and has a huge feature set, especially when compared to other phones of its time, although it lacks many features now considered standard for modern phones, like colour display, integrated camera, polyphonic or digitized ringtones, Bluetooth and GPRS functionality. Modern phones with memory card support also can be natively connected to a computer's USB port, greatly improving transfer speeds when compared to the SL45's serial connection; this limitation can be, however, omitted by using a third-party memory card reader.

The word's first syllable Berg- doesn't correspond etymologically to the German word Berg with the meaning mountain. The Bergisel's contemporary name is derived from the pre-Roman word burgusinus (elevated position), which then altered through folk etymology, causing the occasional spelling Berg Isel or its English equivalent Mount Isel. Among its earlier uses were as a cremation site and as a habitation area during the Iron Age. In 1809, Bergisel was the site of the four Battles of Bergisel under the command of the freedom fighter Andreas Hofer. In 1892, the Andreas Hofer monument was erected in order to commemorate the battles. Since 1952, Innsbruck has hosted one leg of the Four Hills Tournament. The Bergiselschanze was built of concrete for the 1964 Winter Olympics to replace an older, smaller ramp. It was also used for the 1976 Winter Olympics. A new ramp was opened in 2003, designed by the architect Zaha Hadid, as the old one no longer conformed to contemporary requirements of ski jumping. Until an accident following a mass panic, which resulted in several deaths, the Bergisel stadium was also the site of the Air & Style snowboard festival. Both the Brenner railway and the Brennerautobahn have tunnels below the Bergisel. The Sill Gorge, a recreational site, is located at its base.

Early life Lawrence Dominic McCarthy was born in York, Western Australia, on 21 January 1892. The son of Florence McCarthy of Cork, Ireland, and his wife Anne (n√©e Sherry), he was orphaned at a young age and was brought up in Clontarf Orphanage in Perth and educated in Catholic schools. After completing his schooling, from the age of 13 he worked on a farm as an apprentice at Jennacubbine, near Northam. Later, he served with the 18th Light Horse, a Militia unit, for two and a half years before moving to Lion Mill, Perth. He subsequently worked as a contractor sawmiller, losing three fingers on his left hand in an accident. First World War =Gallipoli and the Western Front= McCarthy was initially rejected due to his injuries when he attempted to join the Australian Imperial Force; however, he was later accepted after proving he had won a number of shooting competitions. Enlisted on 16 October 1914 as a private, he was subsequently posted to the 16th Battalion, joining the newly formed unit at Blackboy Hill Camp. His large build later earned him the nickname \\"Fats\\". Sailing for Egypt in December, the battalion landed at Gallipoli on 26 April 1915 on the second day of the campaign against the Turkish. McCarthy remained on the peninsula until illness forced his evacuation in September. By then he had been promoted to sergeant. He returned to duty in November and was among the last in his battalion to leave Gallipoli on 20 December. The 16th Battalion arrived in France in June 1916 where they took part in the fighting against the Germans at Pozi√®res and Mouquet Farm in August. McCarthy was appointed company sergeant major in March 1917 and the following month was commissioned as a second lieutenant. The day after receiving his commission, McCarthy was wounded at Bullecourt and evacuated to England where he spent three months in hospital and convalescing. Rejoining his unit on 9 July, he was promoted to lieutenant on 1 November and was awarded the French Croix de guerre two days later. Between February and August 1918 he was posted the 13th Training Battalion at Tidworth, England where he trained troops, before rejoining his battalion in time for the Allied Hundred Days Offensive that began on 8 August. =Victoria Cross action= Lieutenant Lawrence Dominic McCarthy VC c.1919 On 23 August 1918, McCarthy performed what was later described in the official history as being the most effective piece of individual fighting in the history of the AIF, next to Albert Jacka's Military Cross-winning feat at Pozi√®res. Near Madam Wood, east of Vermandovillers, France, the battalion was heavily opposed by well-posted German machine-guns. McCarthy, realizing the situation, dashed across the open ground with two men to the nearest post, where, having out-distanced his companions, he put the gun out of action, then continued fighting his way down the trench. Later, having been joined by one of his men, together they bombed their way along the trench until contact was established with an adjoining unit. During this action McCarthy had killed 20 of the enemy, taken 50 prisoners and captured 5 machine-guns and 500 yards (460 m) of the German front. The battalion historian wrote that following McCarthy's feat, \\"the prisoners closed in on him from all sides ... and patted him on the back!\\" For this McCarthy was awarded the Victoria Cross that, within his battalion and in some quarters of the London press, came to be known as the \\"super-VC\\". Ten days after the war ended, on 21 November 1918, McCarthy was evacuated to England with influenza, where he was subsequently informed that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross for his action. After recovering he rejoined his battalion on 7 January 1919, subsequently receiving the award from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1919. Later life McCarthy returned to Australia in December 1919, having married Florence Norville the previous January in London. McCarthy was demobilised in August 1920 and returned to Western Australia. Moving to Victoria in 1926 with his wife, he gained employment with the Sunshine Harvester Works as a commercial traveler and remained with them until 1934 when the company was forced to lay off staff during the Great Depression. He subsequently found new work the following year with the Trustees, Executors & Agency Co. in Melbourne, and worked for that company until his retirement in 1969. The couple's only son, Lawrence, was killed in action fighting the Japanese on Bougainville on 20 May 1945. Death and legacy McCarthy died at the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg in Melbourne in May 1975 and was cremated with full military honours. The Lawrence McCarthy Ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood has been named in his honour. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

Convening The Council was implemented by the minister-presidents of the eleven states of Germany within the three Western Allied occupation zones and inaugurated on 1 September 1948. It included 70 state delegates selected by the Landtag parliaments specifically for this purpose (including five non-voting representatives of West Berlin), many of them state ministers, government officials or legal academics. The deputies could rely on a draft document prepared by the constitutional Herrenchiemsee convention held in August. The Council was officially opened by North Rhine-Westphalia minister-president Karl Arnold as host. The second speaker was Hessian minister-president Christian Stock as current head of the Ministerial Conference of the Federal States. The site of the opening ceremony was at the great hall of the Museum Koenig in Bonn, a preliminary decision in view of the \\"provisional\\" capital of a West German state, which the minister-presidents at a convention in D√ºsseldorf on 11 October 1948 decided to locate in Bonn (instead of Frankfurt). The assembly elected the Christian Democratic politician Konrad Adenauer, former mayor of Cologne, its president. The regular sessions of the Parliamentary Council were held at the nearby Pedagogical Academy building. The delegates of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) already formed a united faction with their Christian Social (CSU) colleagues from Bavaria, as did the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) together with the Hessian Liberal-Democratic Party and the Democratic People's Party (DVP) from W√ºrttemberg-Baden and W√ºrttemberg- Hohenzollern. The 65 voting members included 27 Christian Democrats, 27 Social Democrats (SPD) led by Carlo Schmid, and five Liberals under Theodor Heuss. In addition, the Communist Party, the German Party and the Centre Party each sent two delegates. Four of the 65 delegates were women: Elisabeth Selbert (SPD), Friederike Nadig (SPD), Helene Weber (CDU) and Helene Wessel (Centre). The SPD deputy Paul L√∂be had served as President of the Reichstag parliament from 1925 until 1932, when he was succeeded by Hermann G√∂ring. Proceedings Building of the Pedagogical Academy in Bonn, later the Bundeshaus The primary purpose of the Council was to prepare a new constitution for Germany, thereby drawing lessons from the failure of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism, in order to re-establish a federal state based upon a stable democracy, welfare and the Rechtsstaat (rule of law) maxim. The draft declared human dignity inviolable, and to respect and protect it the duty of all state authority. These basic principles were explicitly declared irreversible by the so-called eternity clause. To distinguish it from the newly established People's Republics behind the Iron Curtain, the draft laid stress on a parliamentary system and the separation of powers, all bound to the constitution. It included a charter of fundamental rights and the right of access to courts. The Chancellor as head of government was authorized to draw up the guidelines of policies, while the powers of the President of Germany as head of state were limited. In consequence of the destructive motions in the former Reichstag, the draft implemented the constructive vote of no confidence, whereafter the Chancellor may only be removed from office by the Bundestag parliament if a prospective successor has the support of a majority. The concept of Streitbare Demokratie also included the implementation of the Federal Constitutional Court as an independent judicial body. Its preamble stated the obligation to achieve German unity and the draft also provided for the accession of \\"other parts of Germany\\", as it was applied to the joining of the former Saar Protectorate in 1957 and German reunification in 1990. The Western Allies insisted on the special status of Berlin, which is why the Bundestag MPs from West Berlin were not entitled to vote. The Council adopted the new constitution on 8 May 1949, with 53 against 12 votes, against the votes of the Communist, German Party and Centre delegates, as well as against the votes of six out of eight CSU representatives. It also drafted the Election Law (\\"Wahlgesetz\\") for the first Bundestag election of 1949 (which was later on replaced by the \\"Bundeswahlgesetz\\"). The draft was approved by the three Western Supreme Commanders on May 12, as did the state assemblies‚Äîexcept for the Bavarian Landtag for an assumed insufficient realization of the federalism principle, knowing that the consent of two thirds of the state parliaments were enough for the enactment. The Basic Law was then formally signed and promulgated on May 23. The Parliamentary Council disassembled once it had finished its purpose, i.e. after the ratification and the enactment of the first Election Law in preparation of the 1949 federal election, which among others the Basic Law had left it as a remaining task.

A soldier with The Bedfordshire Regiment during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions on 24 October 1918, during the Battle of the Selle. Early life Frederick Hedges was born on 6 June 1896 at Umballa in India, the seventh of nine children. His father was serving in the British Army as a bandmaster. By 1901, the Hedges family was living in Hounslow, Middlesex. He was educated at Grove Road Boy's School, and Isleworth County School. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, Hedges volunteered for the British Army and was posted as a rifleman to the 9th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Queen Victoria's Rifles). The regiment was part of the 13th Infantry Brigade, 5th Division, and in November 1914, it was sent to the Western Front in France where it served for several months, including during the First Battle of Ypres. Hedges suffered frostbite and was evacuated to England in January 1915 for treatment. He had recovered within a couple of months and returned to the London Regiment. Hedges was commissioned into the Bedfordshire Regiment in July 1915 and after a period of training at Felixstowe, served as a musketry instructor for several months in England. However, in September 1916, he returned to the Western Front, this time to 6th Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment. He fought in the Battle of the Ancre in November 1916 and in the Battle of Arras the following year, during which he was wounded in the hand. After a period of treatment at Rouen, he was sent to England for further medical care at Portsmouth and then at Osbourne House at the Isle of Wight. Hedges did not return to the frontlines until September 1918, having served briefly as a machinegun instructor on recovering from his wounds. Promoted to full lieutenant, he was attached to the 6th Battalion, The Northamptonshire Regiment, as his original unit had been disbanded. On 24 October 1918, the battalion was involved in the Battle of the Selle. Leading a company of the battalion near the village of Hecq, northeast of Bousies, Hedges, with another soldier, captured two machinegun posts that was holding up the advance. A few days later, during an engagement in the Mormal Forest, he was wounded in the head and shoulder. He was evacuated to England for treatment on 8 November 1918. For his actions on 24 October he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Hedge's VC read: Following his recovery, he received his VC in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 15 May 1919. The next month, he was placed in command of a prisoner of war camp in Guildford. Not long afterwards, he married his fianc√©e, Mollie , in Hounslow, Middlesex. In late September, he was injured in a motorbike accident and suffered a fractured leg. He was discharged from the British Army before the end of the year. Later life After leaving military service, Hedges found employment with the Cornhill Insurance Company. He was instrumental in the setting up of a memorial to former students of his old school at Isleworth County who had been killed during the war and was also involved in the British Legion. In 1924, his first son, John Grosvenor Hedges, was born. During the Second World War, both father and son served in the Home Guard. However, in 1941, John died in a drowning accident on the Thames. After the war, Hedges and his wife moved to Harrogate in Leeds where he was to run Cornhill's office there. He was never at ease with the shift and he became affected by depression. On 29 May 1954, the anniversary of John's death, he committed suicide, hanging himself at his home. His mental state had worsened since he had to take early retirement from his work. His remains were cremated. Victoria Cross After his death, Hedges' medals, which in addition to the VC, also included the 1914 Star, the Victory Medal, the British War Medal, and the 1937 and 1953 Coronation Medals, were loaned to the Leeds City Museum. They are now in the care of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, displayed at the gallery located in Wardown Park Museum, Luton, Bedfordshire.

He had already been awarded the Military Medal and Distinguished Conduct Medal for actions earlier in the war. Early life Samuel Lewis Honey was born on 9 February 1894 in Conn in Ontario to Reverend George Edward Honey and Metta Blaisdell. His father, originally from Boston, was a Methodist who moved his family from town to town as he took up a succession of ministries. Honey, who was known to his family as \\"Lew\\", attended schools in Drayton, Princeton and London, all in Ontario. When he was 17, Honey went teaching at schools on the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Ontario. He then resumed his own education, attending Walkerton High School from which he graduated in mid-1914 with honours in several subjects. He returned to teaching for a brief period while planning to enter Victoria College at University of Toronto. However, with the First World War underway, he decided to joined the Canadian Army. First World War Honey enlisted on 22 January 1915 and was posted to the 34th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force as a private. The battalion departed for England in October 1915, and by this time Honey had been promoted to sergeant. While in England he served as an physical fitness instructor before being transferred to the 78th Battalion, which was engaged on the Western Front. He earned the Military Medal for his actions in a raid on German trenches on 22 February 1917, providing cover for both his squad and another in the face of heavy grenade fire, having cleared a communications trench. Afterwards, Honey wrote that his entire party deserved recognition as well. In April 1917, he fought in the Battle of Vimy Ridge, earning the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for leadership and maintaining morale in the face of extremely heavy fire. He was modest about his DCM, stating in correspondence that he was simply lucky. Recommended for a commission after the battle, Honey was subsequently selected for officer training. Sent to England, he spent time at Bramshott Camp as an instructor before taking an officer's course at Bexhill. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in October 1917 and returned to the 78th Battalion for duty. In late September 1918 at Bourlon Wood, the 78th Battalion participated in the Battle of the Canal du Nord. During the fighting on 27 September, Honey had to take command of his company due to all the other officers becoming casualties. He led the company in clearing German strongpoints and defending a number of counterattacks. Towards the end of the battle, he was wounded and died of these on 30 September 1918. He was buried in Pas de Calais in France, at the Queant Communal Cemetery. For his actions during the Battle of the Canal du Nord, Honey was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC, gazetted in early January 1919, read: There was no formal presentation of the VC to Honey's relatives, at their request. Instead, the medal was sent to Canada by the War Office. In turn, the Governor General forwarded it on by mail to Honey's father. Plaques to his memory exist in several locations; Wescott United Church in Conn, Valour Place in Cambridge, Ontario, and the Galt Armoury. Medals Honey's medals, from left to right: the Victoria Cross, Distinguished Conduct Medal, Military Medal, British War Medal, Victory Medal His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Canada, alongside his Distinguished Conduct Medal, Military Medal, British War Medal and Victory Medal.

The 70th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion (and defending World Series champion) Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion New York Mets. The Athletics won the series in seven games for their second of three consecutive World Series titles. The Mets won the NL East division by games over the St. Louis Cardinals, then defeated the Cincinnati Reds, three games to two, in the NL Championship Series. The Athletics won the AL West division by six games over the Kansas City Royals, then defeated the Baltimore Orioles, three games to two, in the AL Championship Series. This was the first World Series in which all weekday games started at night. This was the last World Series in which each team produced and sold its own game programs for its home games. Starting in 1974, MLB printed an official World Series program that was sold in both stadiums. This was the third consecutive World Series, all seven games, in which the winning team scored fewer runs overall. The trend continued for the next seven-game series in 1975, when the Reds defeated the Boston Red Sox. Background =New York Mets= The 1973 Mets' .509 season winning percentage is the lowest posted by any pennant winner in major league history. Injuries plagued the team throughout the season. The team got off to a promising 4‚Äì0 start, and went .600 for the month of April. Before long, however, the team was soon beset with injuries and fell in standing, just as with their previous season. Stumbling through the summer in last place, the Mets got healthy and hot in September, ultimately winning the division with a mere 82 victories, marking the only time between 1970 and 1980 that neither their rival Philadelphia Phillies, nor the Pittsburgh Pirates, won the division. The final standings: At 82‚Äì79, the 1973 New York Mets had the worst record of any team to play in a World Series. They had only the ninth-best record in the 24-team major leagues, behind the Oakland A's, the Cincinnati Reds (who they beat in the National League Championship Series), the Baltimore Orioles (who were defeated by Oakland in the American League Championship Series), the Los Angeles Dodgers, the San Francisco Giants, the Boston Red Sox, the Detroit Tigers and the Kansas City Royals (none of whom made the postseason). The 1973 New York Mets had the lowest winning percentage (now the second-lowest) of any postseason team (the San Diego Padres finished 82‚Äì80 in 2005). 1969 holdovers Bud Harrelson, Jerry Grote, Wayne Garrett, Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Tug McGraw and Cleon Jones joined forces with the Mets' farm-system alumni John Milner and Jon Matlack and trade-acquired Rusty Staub, F√©lix Mill√°n, and Willie Mays, now 42 years old. Don Hahn and Mays alternated in center field, although they both batted right-handed. The Mets' NLCS opponents, an imposing Cincinnati Reds squad that posted 99 victories during the regular season, were the favorite to return to the Series for a second consecutive year. (The Reds had fallen to the A's in the previous year's Series.) The 1973 NLCS went the full five games, and featured a now- famous brawl between Pete Rose and Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson. In the end, the Mets continued their improbable rise and bumped Rose and the rest of the mighty Reds from the playoffs. Willie Mays recorded the final hit of his career in Game 2. In four World Series (1951, 1954, 1962, and 1973), Mays did not hit a single home run. He hit only one in the postseason, during the 1971 NLCS. Mays also fell in the outfield. =Oakland A's= 1973 World Series MVP, Reggie Jackson (before game 3). The Oakland A's secured the pennant by overcoming the Baltimore Orioles in the 1973 ALCS. The A's, defending champions, still possessed a formidable lineup headed by a healthy Reggie Jackson, (.293, 32 HR, 117 RBI, 22 stolen bases) who would be named league MVP in 1973. Jackson was joined in the lineup by standouts like third baseman Sal Bando, the fine defensive outfielder Joe Rudi, the speedy shortstop Bert Campaneris, and the A's catcher, 1972 World Series hero Gene Tenace. The pitching staff featured three 20-game winners, Ken Holtzman (21‚Äì13), Catfish Hunter (21‚Äì5), and Vida Blue (20‚Äì9), with Rollie Fingers (22 saves, 1.92) serving as the A's ace relief pitcher. The A's offered entertainment both on and off the field in 1973; their brightly colored uniforms were the perfect metaphor for a team notable for clashing personalities. The stars engaged regularly in conflicts with each other and with owner Charles O. Finley. With the designated hitter rule in effect for the first time in 1973, American League pitchers did not bat during the regular season. They were, however, expected to take their turn at the plate during each game of this Series. So it was that a man who had played no offensive role during the regular season came to make a key batting contribution for the A's during the Series. With some extra batting practice, A's pitcher Ken Holtzman would stroke a double that helped the A's to win Game 1 ‚Äì and another double that helped them secure the deciding seventh game. This Series was also notable for an incident where Finley attempted to \\"fire\\" second-baseman Mike Andrews for his errors in Game 2 (see below). Commissioner Bowie Kuhn would reinstate Andrews and fine Finley. Despite the hostility of the Oakland players toward the team's owner, the A's would be the first to repeat as World Champions since the 1961‚Äì62 New York Yankees. Oakland manager Dick Williams resigned after the Series was over, having had enough of owner Charles O. Finley's interference. Oakland reliever Darold Knowles became the first pitcher to appear in every game of a seven-game World Series. Summary Matchups =Game 1= The Mets and A's opened the Series in Oakland with Jon Matlack and Ken Holtzman as the Game 1 starters (Matlack, with a 14‚Äì16 record during the 1973 season, is one of only four pitchers in history to start Game 1 of a World Series after a regular season losing record). Willie Mays started in place of the injured Rusty Staub and batted third in what turned out to be his final big league start. In the third, pitcher Holtzman doubled and scored when Bert Campaneris hit a routine grounder that inexplicably bounced between Mets second baseman's F√©lix Mill√°n's legs. Campaneris then stole second and scored on a single to right by Joe Rudi. The Mets came up with a run in the fourth on an RBI single by John Milner that scored Cleon Jones. Holtzman, Rollie Fingers, and Darold Knowles then shut the door on the Mets offense; Knowles earned the save. =Game 2= Game 2, eventually won by the Mets 10‚Äì7 in 12 innings, set a new record for the longest game in Series history at four hours and 13 minutes. Along with blinding sunshine \\"turn{ing} every fly ball into adventure\\" (especially for a 42-year-old Willie Mays), Curt Gowdy described the contest in the official MLB 1973 Fall Classic highlight film as one of the \\"longest and weirdest games in World Series history\\". Vida Blue opposed Jerry Koosman on the mound, but neither pitched well. In the first inning, the A's jumped on Koosman for two runs as the flyball adventures began. With one out, Joe Rudi reached second on a fly ball to left that Cleon Jones lost in the sun as he drifted to the warning track and the ball dropped in front of him. Rudi scored when the next batter, Sal Bando, hit a ball to right center that Don Hahn misplayed and allowed to bounce to the wall as Bando reached third. After Gene Tenace walked with two outs, Bando scored on a Jes√∫s Alou double. The A's scored again in the second on Joe Rudi's single scoring the ubiquitous Bert Campaneris, who had tripled. The Mets got home runs from Cleon Jones and Wayne Garrett in the second and third innings, respectively. The A's were still up 3‚Äì2 going into the sixth when things got even more strange. With one out and two on, Horacio Pi√±a relieved Blue and promptly hit Jerry Grote with his first pitch, loading the bases. Don Hahn then drove home Cleon Jones with an infield hit and Bud Harrelson followed with an RBI single to put the Mets ahead 4‚Äì3. Jim Beauchamp then pinch-hit for reliever Harry Parker and hit a comebacker to the mound. Darold Knowles, who had relieved Pina, fielded the ball but lost his balance hurrying the throw home and threw wildly past Ray Fosse on the attempted force play. Two more Mets runs scored for a 6‚Äì3 lead. Reggie Jackson had an RBI double in the seventh to make it 6‚Äì4. In the ninth, Deron Johnson, batting for Blue Moon Odom, lifted a fly ball to center that Willie Mays lost in the sun and fell down while chasing. Johnson reached second. Allan Lewis pinch-ran and scored on a single by Jackson after Sal Bando walked. Gene Tenace singled in Bando to tie it. The Mets threatened in the 10th when Harrelson led off with a single. Tug McGraw bunted for a sacrifice and Rollie Fingers threw to second, but Harrelson ran with the pitch and was safe. McGraw was retired on the relay to first. Harrelson went to third when Garrett bounced a high grounder to Tenace at first and reached when Tenace's throw pulled Fingers off the bag. Harrelson then tagged and attempted to score on a F√©lix Mill√°n fly to left. Harrelson appeared to have sidestepped Fosse's tag at the plate (and replays from NBC's broadcast clearly showed Fosse missed him), but he was called out by umpire Augie Donatelli, prompting a heated outburst from Harrelson, on-deck batter Willie Mays, and manager Yogi Berra. The game stayed knotted at 6‚Äì6 until the top of the 12th. Harrelson led off with a double and went to third when McGraw reached first on a bunt that Sal Bando overran. With two outs, Mays drove in Harrelson with a single that would turn out to be the final hit and RBI of his storied career. It gave the Mets a 7‚Äì6 lead. After Jones walked to load the bases, John Milner grounded to second baseman Mike Andrews, but the ball went through his legs. McGraw and Mays scored to make the lead 9‚Äì6. The next batter, Grote, hit another grounder to Andrews, but his throw to first pulled Tenace off the bag (though NBC replays showed Tenace kept his foot on the bag). Jones scored to make it 10‚Äì6. The A's added a run in the bottom of the inning when Jackson reached third as Mays lost yet another fly ball in the sun and Alou singled him home, but Andrews' errors proved too much to overcome. McGraw, who pitched six innings total, earned the win, and George Stone the save and the Mets evened the series. A's owner Charlie Finley was furious at Andrews' 12th-inning miscues; he proceeded to punish Andrews (and further alienate A's manager Dick Williams) by placing the infielder on the disabled list‚Äîciting a fake injury that would have sidelined Andrews for the rest of the Series. Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn stepped in, reactivated Andrews, and disciplined Finley. =Game 3= Game 3 matched up Tom Seaver and Catfish Hunter. Hunter had trouble early on when Wayne Garrett homered to right and F√©lix Mill√°n scored on a wild pitch, but then found his rhythm. Seaver kept the A's off the board until the sixth, when Sal Bando and Gene Tenace broke through with consecutive doubles that delivered a run and cut the Met lead to 2‚Äì1. Joe Rudi came up with another clutch hit in the eighth when he singled in Bert Campaneris to tie the game. In the tenth, Willie Mays would make his final appearance in an MLB game, unsuccessfully pinch-hitting for Tug McGraw. Campaneris delivered the game- winning RBI in the 11th when he singled off Harry Parker to score Ted Kubiak. Rollie Fingers got the save. =Game 4= A's starter Ken Holtzman couldn't make it out of the first inning after Rusty Staub smashed a three-run homer to left-center. Blue Moon Odom relieved and gave up a two-run single to Staub in a three-run Mets fourth. Jon Matlack got the win by pitching eight innings of three-hit ball. Ray Sadecki pitched the ninth and got the save. Mike Andrews entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the eighth, prompting a standing ovation from the Mets' home crowd, in a display of defiance toward A's owner Charlie Finley. Andrews grounded out in what would be his last major league at-bat. =Game 5= Game 5 was a rematch up of Vida Blue and Jerry Koosman. This time, both pitchers threw well. John Milner had an RBI single in the second, and Don Hahn's triple to center field scored Jerry Grote with the second Mets run in the sixth. Koosman pitched well and got the win, with a save from Tug McGraw. =Game 6= The A's won, thanks to the clutch pitching of Catfish Hunter (who outdueled Tom Seaver), and the timely hitting of Reggie Jackson. Jackson doubled and drove in Joe Rudi in the first inning and doubled in Sal Bando in the third to give Oakland a 2‚Äì0 lead. In the eighth inning, the Mets threatened, knocking Hunter out of the game after Ken Boswell singled in a run. Reliever Darold Knowles put out the fire by striking out Rusty Staub on three pitches with two men on base. In the bottom half of the inning, the A's added an insurance run when Jackson singled, advanced to third on center fielder Don Hahn's error, and scored on Jes√∫s Alou's sacrifice fly. Rollie Fingers got the save in the ninth inning to force a seventh game. =Game 7= Ken Holtzman outdueled Jon Matlack in a rematch of the Game 4 starters. The third inning proved to be the difference, as Holtzman lined a one-out double off Matlack to left, his second of the Series after not batting at all during the season. Matlack then surrendered a two-run opposite-field homer to Bert Campaneris (Oakland's first home run of the series), and then another two-run blast to Reggie Jackson later in the inning, giving the A's a 4‚Äì0 lead and Holtzman all the runs he needed. The Mets came back with two runs after Oakland increased their lead to 5‚Äì0 in the fifth inning, but it was not enough. Campaneris snagged a Wayne Garrett pop fly to end the series; and Jackson was named the World Series MVP. In the third inning, Gene Tenace walked for the 11th time tying the Series record set by Babe Ruth of the Yankees in 1926. In the seventh inning, Wayne Garrett struck out for the 11th time tying the Series record set by Eddie Mathews of the Milwaukee Braves in 1958 (later broken in 1980 when Willie Wilson of the Royals struck out 12 times). Darold Knowles got the save and became the only pitcher to appear in all seven games of a seven-game World Series until Brandon Morrow in the 2017 World Series.

On 9 May 1915 near Rue du Bois, France, Lance-Corporal Finlay led a bombing party of 12 men in the attack until 10 of them had fallen. He then ordered the two survivors to crawl back and he himself went to the assistance of a wounded man and carried him over a distance of 100 yards of fire-swept ground into cover, quite regardless of his own safety. Finlay was later promoted to the rank of sergeant. He was killed in action in Mesopotamia on 21 January 1916 and is remembered on the Basra Memorial.CWGC entry Further information Finlay is commemorated on the war memorial in Moonzie Kirkyard in Fife.

Indian rope trick In 1917, Holmes who was a Lieutenant at the time, stated that whilst on his veranda with a group of officers in Kirkee, he had observed the Indian rope trick being performed by an old man and young boy. The boy climbed the rope, balanced himself and then descended. The old man tapped the rope and it collapsed.The Great Indian Rope- Trick. Photographed for the first time by Lieut. F.W.

It was examined by Robert Elliot who stated it was not a demonstration of the Indian rope trick but an example of a balancing trick on a bamboo pole. Elliot noted that \\"the tapering of the pole is an absolutely clear feature and definitely shows that it was not a rope.\\"Elliot, Robert Henry. (1934). The Myth of the Mystical East. Wm.

The 69th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the American League champion Oakland Athletics and the National League champion Cincinnati Reds. The Athletics won in seven games. It was the first World Series championship for the Athletics since 1930. These two teams met again in the World Series 18 years later in 1990. Their managers would meet again in the Fall Classic 12 years later in 1984, helming different teams and swapping leagues. Background The A's won the American League West division by 5¬Ω games over the Chicago White Sox, then defeated the Detroit Tigers three games to two in the American League Championship Series. The Cincinnati Reds won the National League West division by 10¬Ω games over both the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros. The Reds dethroned the defending World Series champion Pittsburgh Pirates three games to two in the National League Championship Series, marking the first year in which an LCS series in either league went the full five games since divisional play was introduced in . The Reds () won one less game than the Pirates () during the strike-reduced regular season and became the first team in MLB history to reach the World Series without having the best record in its respective league. In each of the first six League Championship Series, the team with the better record advanced to the World Series. (The A's () had the best record in the American League in 1972, but the AL pennant winner the next three seasons did not.) This was Cincinnati's second trip to the World Series in three years, previously falling to Baltimore in five games in 1970. It was Oakland's first-ever trip to the Series, and the first for the franchise since 1931, when the team was located in Philadelphia. This was a matchup of the two premier MLB dynasties of the 1970s, with the Reds winning two World Series (1975‚Äì76) in four WS appearances, while the A's won three straight (1972‚Äì74). Iconoclastic club owner Charlie Finley's \\"Swingin' A's\\" featured day-glo uniforms, white shoes, much facial hair, colorful nicknames, and explosive personalities, while \\"The Big Red Machine\\" was a more traditional franchise with a more traditional look (including a facial-hair ban)‚Äîand an everyday lineup with three future Hall of Famers as well as all-time hits king, Pete Rose. The Series was dubbed \\"The Hairs vs. the Squares.\\" Oakland played the Series without its star outfielder Reggie Jackson, who was injured (pulled hamstring) stealing home in the second inning of the final game of the ALCS at Detroit on Left-handed reliever Darold Knowles was also missing for the A's, breaking his thumb on September 27, less than three weeks before the Series opener. With Jackson out, the Athletics were decided underdogs. George Hendrick was inserted into center field for Jackson. And while Hendrick only went 2-for-15 (.133 avg.), unheralded catcher Gene Tenace stepped up. Tenace had a poor regular season, hitting only .225 with five home runs. He was even worse in the AL Championship series against Detroit, going 1 for 17 (.059), although his one hit drove in the go-ahead run in Game 5. In the World Series however, Tenace was spectacular, hitting four home runs equaling the World Series mark set by Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Hank Bauer. He also had nine RBI in the Series‚Äîno other Oakland player had more than one. Tenace was voted World Series MVP. By contrast, the stellar Oakland pitching kept the middle of the Reds lineup quiet for most of the series. Johnny Bench (.270 avg., 40 HR, 125 RBI, NL MVP), Tony P√©rez (.283 avg., 21 HR, 90 RBI), and Denis Menke (9 HR, 50 RBI), combined for only two homers and five RBI the entire Series. Perez did lead both teams with 10 hits and a .435 batting average, but all 10 hits were singles. It didn't help that the Reds' \\"table-setters,\\" Pete Rose and Joe Morgan were a combined 1 for 28 through the first four games, when the Reds lost three of those games. The teams were fairly equal statistically, each club totaling 46 hits with the same .209 batting average (the combined batting averages were the lowest recorded in a 7-game World Series). The Reds outscored the A's by five runs, but all four of their losses were by a single run. Six of the seven games in the series were decided by one run, marking perhaps the most closely contested World Series in history. Summary ‚Ä†: postponed from October 17 due to rain Matchups =Game 1= Oakland jumped out to a one-game series lead behind catcher Gene Tenace, who hit a home run in each of his first two at-bats. Tenace became the first player ever to homer in his two initial Series plate appearances, a feat later matched by Andruw Jones of the Atlanta Braves in 1996. Only two Oakland players collected hits, a pair each from Tenace and Bert Campaneris. The A's received a combined four innings of shutout relief from Rollie Fingers and Vida Blue to secure the victory for starter Ken Holtzman. Blue stranded the potential tying run at third base to end the game by inducing Pete Rose to ground out to second base. =Game 2= The Game 2 hero was A's left fielder Joe Rudi, who smacked a home run and added a sparkling, game-saving catch up against the wall in the ninth inning on a ball hit by Denis Menke. Catfish Hunter pitched eight strong innings, consistently wiggling out of trouble, and also added an RBI single in the second off Ross Grimsley. The Reds' failure to produce in the clutch was as much the story as Rudi's heroics as Cincinnati had leadoff baserunners in five innings but only scored a run in the ninth. In the ninth, Tony P√©rez led off with a base hit before Rudi's catch of Menke's drive for the first out. Oakland first baseman Mike Hegan then made another great defensive play when C√©sar Ger√≥nimo, the next Reds hitter, lined a shot that appeared headed down the line for extra bases. Hegan dove for the ball, knocked it down, and dove for the bag, barely beating Geronimo. P√©rez took second and scored on a Hal McRae single through the middle. Rollie Fingers then relieved Hunter and induced pinch hitter Juli√°n Javier to pop out to Hegan in foul territory to end the game. The World Series home loss was Reds' seventh-straight, which included three in the 1961 World Series against the New York Yankees (at Crosley Field) and two in the 1970 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. Jackie Robinson, the first black major league player of the modern era, made his final public appearance in Cincinnati before Game 2 (he died nine days later). In a brief speech, he expressed his desire to see a black manager in Major League Baseball, a color barrier that had not yet been broken. Two years later, Frank Robinson was hired in October 1974 to manage the Cleveland Indians to break =Game 3= Heavy storms delayed Game 3 by a day, but the Reds got back into the series behind a strong performance from starter Jack Billingham, who held the A's to three hits in eight innings. The Reds pushed across the game's only run in the seventh when C√©sar Ger√≥nimo singled home Tony P√©rez. P√©rez scored despite slipping on the still damp grass as he rounded third. Oakland shortstop Bert Campaneris was apparently unaware that Perez had slipped; otherwise, it appeared Campaneris may have had a play at the plate. Clay Carroll pitched the ninth for the save. A rare trick play occurred in the eighth inning. The Reds had Joe Morgan on third and Bobby Tolan on first base with Rollie Fingers pitching to NL MVP Johnny Bench. Fingers pitched carefully to Bench before Tolan stole second base on ball three. After the stolen base, with the count 3‚Äì2 on Bench, A's manager Dick Williams visited the mound. After a long discussion, he motioned for an intentional walk to Bench. A's catcher Gene Tenace stood to catch ball four, but at the last second returned to his crouch as Fingers delivered a strike on the outside corner. Bench watched the pitch go by for strike three. =Game 4= A very pivotal game in the series, and it was Gene Tenace and Oakland non-starters who came through in the ninth inning to rally the Athletics to victory to put the A's up 3 games to 1. The game was a pitchers' dual between a pair of left-handed starters: Cincinnati's Don Gullett and Oakland's Ken Holtzman. Through seven innings, the game's lone run was a result of a fifth- inning home run by Tenace, his third homer of the series. With two outs in the top of the eighth inning and Dave Concepci√≥n on second base, A's manager Dick Williams replaced Holtzman with left-hander Vida Blue to face left-handed hitters Joe Morgan and Bobby Tolan. Blue walked Morgan and allowed a clutch two-run double to Tolan, giving Cincinnati the lead as the Reds seemed poised to tie the series at 2 games apiece. In the bottom of the ninth, however, with one out, the A's strung together four consecutive hits to score two runs. Pinch hitter Gonzalo M√°rquez singled, Tenace followed with a single, Don Mincher followed with another pinch-hit single scoring pinch-runner Allan Lewis to tie the game before a third pinch-hitter, √Ångel Mangual, singled off Clay Carroll to score Tenace with the game-winner to put Oakland up three games to one. It was the first time that a team collected three pinch hits in the same World Series inning. =Game 5= Up three games to one and with ace Catfish Hunter on the mound, the A's looked poised to close out Cincinnati. Compounding problems for the Reds, their ace pitcher Gary Nolan, who had been battling shoulder and neck issues during the second half of the regular season, was unable to pitch Game 5, forcing part-time starter Jim McGlothlin to start instead. But two of the struggling Reds, Pete Rose and Joe Morgan who were a combined 1 for 28 at the plate in the first four games, stepped up to make key plays. Rose led off the game with a home run, and he would also drive in the game-winning run in the ninth inning. The game ended dramatically when Morgan threw out the potential game-tying run at the plate as the Reds staved off elimination. Trailing 1‚Äì0 in the second, Gene Tenace hit his fourth home run of the series, a three-run shot, to put Oakland up by two. McGlothlin was removed after pitching just three innings. The Reds cut the lead to 3‚Äì2 in the fourth on a home run by Denis Menke. √Ångel Mangual put the A's back in front by two runs with a pinch-hit RBI single in the fourth. The Reds continued to answer. With two outs in the fifth, Joe Morgan walked. With a 3‚Äì2 count on Bobby Tolan, Morgan broke for second and was able to score when Tolan lined a base hit into right-center field. The speedy Morgan and Tolan collaborated once again in the eighth. Morgan again walked, stole second and scored on another Tolan single to tie the game at four. In the ninth, Rose singled in the go-ahead run to give the Reds a 5-4 lead. Game 3 starter Jack Billingham came in to relieve in the ninth, but the A's put runners on the corners with one out. Bert Campaneris hit a foul pop behind first base that Tony P√©rez drifted back and appeared to call for. But second baseman Morgan raced over, waved Perez off, caught the ball, slipped on the grass but got up and fired a throw to nail pinch runner Blue Moon Odom, who had tagged from third. The Friday afternoon contest was the last non-weekend World Series day game. The three games in Oakland had all been scheduled to be played at night, but Game 3 was rained out, forcing Game 5 to be played on a Friday, originally scheduled as a travel day. The game was played in the afternoon (1 p.m. PT) to allow ample time for the teams to travel to Cincinnati for Game 6 the next day. =Game 6= Back at the friendly confines of Riverfront Stadium, the Reds tied the series at three games apiece with a rout. Johnny Bench, who had no RBI in the series to that point, broke a scoreless tie in the fourth with a homer off starter Vida Blue. The A's fought back on a Dick Green RBI double in their half of the fifth, but from then on it was all Reds. Dave Concepci√≥n had a sacrifice fly in the fifth, and Tony P√©rez an RBI single in the sixth (his first RBI of the Series). The Reds then broke it open with a five-run seventh an RBI single by Joe Morgan and a pair of two-run singles by Bobby Tolan and C√©sar Ger√≥nimo. =Game 7= Gene Tenace capped a spectacular World Series with two hits, two RBI and he also scored the game-winning run in the sixth inning on Sal Bando's double. Oakland scored an unearned run in the first inning off Jack Billingham when Reds center fielder Bobby Tolan misplayed a fly ball by Mangual into a three-base error. Mangual scored on a two-out single by Tenace on a ball that hit a seam in the Astroturf and bounced over the head of third baseman Denis Menke. The Reds tied the game in the fifth on a bases loaded sacrifice fly to the center field wall by Hal McRae. However, McRae was pinch hitting for Billingham who had allowed no earned runs in innings in the series against the A's. His replacement in the sixth inning, Pedro Borb√≥n, surrendered RBI doubles to Tenace and Bando. Bando's drive appeared catchable, but Tolan pulled up short of the wall due to a strained hamstring and the ball went over Tolan to the base of the wall. He was later removed from the game on a double switch. The Reds closed to within 3‚Äì2 in the eighth on a sacrifice fly by Perez, but A's closer Rollie Fingers shut down the Reds in the ninth. The World Series victory for the Oakland A's was the first for the franchise since the days of Connie Mack when the team was in Philadelphia and had won in 1930. The victory ensured manager Dick Williams' return for another year. It was the Athletics' sixth World Series title, and the first of three consecutive titles. This was the last time to date that an American League team had won a World Series Game 7 on the road until , when the Houston Astros did so in Los Angeles.

He was one of the eleven recipients of the VC awarded for their part in the battle. Later life Blue Plaque marking the home of Private Frederick Hitch V.C. at 62 Cranbrook Road, Turnham Green, London. Hitch's wounds were so severe that they led to his discharge from service. He then moved from job to job, unable to perform manual work due to the damage to his arm he had received during the battle. He married in 1883, but reportedly found life difficult living on his disability pension from the government, which amounted to just ¬£10 a year. In 1901, whilst climbing a ladder he suffered a fall. When he awoke in hospital his VC, which he always wore, had been stolen. Another version is that he was given a position in Whitehall as a ceremonial guard and his VC was cut off his chest and he was knocked to the ground. In this version his VC was replaced by the regiment. His missing VC later reappeared at auction and was bought by Hitch's descendants for ¬£85. Both the original and the replacement are in the regimental museum. Forced to pay for a new one from his own pocket, Hitch also lost his job soon afterwards when he was accused of faking the fall to hide the fact that he had sold his medal to raise funds. This has never been proven. Hitch had eight children, and managed to land a steady job as driver of a smart horse-drawn cab (pulled by his own pair of horses), which he later exchanged for a motor taxi cab. This provided him with a comfortable income for some years. Death By the time of his death in 1913, Hitch was living alone in Chiswick, West London at 62 Cranbrook Road where he is commemorated with a blue plaque from English Heritage. He collapsed and died at his home whilst talking to a neighbour. He was buried in St Nicholas' churchyard in Chiswick, with full military honours. His funeral was attended by a large number of London 'cabbies' and he is commemorated by the Fred Hitch Gallantry Award for cab drivers.

The 68th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the defending World Series and American League (AL) champion Baltimore Orioles and the National League (NL) champion Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates won in seven games. Game 4 in Pittsburgh was the first World Series game played The teams proved to be evenly matched, as the Series went the full seven games; the home team prevailed in each of the first six. In Game Seven in Baltimore, the Pirates' Steve Blass pitched a four-hit complete game for a win over Mike Cuellar and In his final World Series appearance, Roberto Clemente became the first Spanish-speaking ballplayer to earn World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He hit safely in all seven games of the Series, duplicating a feat he had performed in . Twenty-one-year-old rookie Bruce Kison pitched scoreless innings and allowed just one hit in two appearances for the Pirates; he set a record of three hit batters in a World Series game, which also tied the 1907 record for a World Series. This was the first of three consecutive World Series, all seven games, in which the winning team scored fewer runs overall. The trend continued for the next seven-game series in 1975. These two teams met again in the fall classic eight years later, with the same result, as the Pirates won the final three games to win in seven. Background The Pirates won the National League East by seven games over the St. Louis Cardinals then defeated the San Francisco Giants, three games to one, in the National League Championship Series. The Orioles won the American League East by 12 games over the Detroit Tigers then swept the Oakland A's in the American League Championship Series. The Orioles were coming off their third straight AL playoff series sweep (twice over the Minnesota Twins and once over Oakland) and their third straight season with over 100 wins: 109 (1969), 108 (1970), 101 (1971). Featuring four pitchers with 20 or more wins (Dave McNally (21), Mike Cuellar (20), Pat Dobson (20), Jim Palmer (20)), the booming bats of sluggers Frank Robinson (28, 99, .281) and Boog Powell (22, 92, .256), and the sure hands of Brooks Robinson at third and Mark Belanger at short, the O's were primed to defend their title. The Pirates were in the World Series for the first time since the heroics of Bill Mazeroski (his only appearance in the series came as a pinch-hitter in Game 1) in Game 7 of the 1960 match-up against the New York Yankees. Though not as decorated as the O's staff, the Pirates featured 19-game winner Dock Ellis and 15-game winner Steve Blass. The Bucs did boast a murderous lineup led by Willie Stargell (48, 125, .295), Bob Robertson (26, 72, .271) and Roberto Clemente (13, 86, .341), who collected 12 series hits and hit .414. Summary ‚Ä†: postponed from October 10 due to rain Matchups =Game 1= Merv Rettenmund The Pirates scored three in the second off of Dave McNally due to sloppy defense by the Orioles. Bob Robertson led off with a walk and went to second on a wild pitch by O's starter Dave McNally. Manny Sanguill√©n grounded to short, but Mark Belanger threw wildly to third in an attempt to retire Robertson. Robertson scored and Sanguill√©n pulled in at second. After advancing to third on a ground ball by Jos√© Pag√°n, Sanguill√©n scored on a suicide squeeze bunt laid down by Jackie Hern√°ndez, who went to second when catcher Elrod Hendricks threw wildly to first. Dave Cash singled home Hernandez with the only hit the Pirates got the whole inning among the three runs. The Orioles rallied behind the long-ball. Frank Robinson hit a home run in the second and Merv Rettenmund blasted a three-run home run in the third off Dock Ellis to give the Orioles the lead. Don Buford added a home run off of Bob Moose in the fifth as McNally settled down and allowed only two more hits and no runs the rest of the way. =Game 2= Jim Palmer Richie Hebner Following a one-day delay caused by the first World Series rainout in nine years, the Orioles took a series lead on Monday afternoon. Baltimore pounded six Pirate pitchers for 14 hits (all singles) and 11 runs, led by three hits and four RBI by Brooks Robinson, who drove in the first Oriole run in the second. In the fourth, with the bases loaded by a single, hit-by-pitch and walk, Davey Johnson's two-run single made it 3‚Äì0 Orioles and knocked starter Bob Johnson out of the game. Two walks by Bruce Kison forced in another run to make it 4‚Äì0 Orioles. In the fifth, after two singles, Elrod Hendricks's two- run single, aided by an error and Robinson's single, made it 7‚Äì0 Orioles. After another single, Bob Veale relieved Moose and allowed two walks to load the bases and force in another run. Don Buford's groundout and Merv Rettenmund's RBI single made it 10‚Äì0 Orioles. Robinson's RBI single next inning off of Bob Miller capped the Orioles' scoring. Jim Palmer pitched seven shutout innings and helped himself the easy way by drawing two bases-loaded walks for two RBIs - the only time this has happened in a World Series game. The Pirates got their runs in the eighth when Richie Hebner hit a three-run homer This was very nearly the first night game in World Series history. After rain postponed Game Two‚Äîoriginally scheduled for Sunday afternoon‚ÄîCommissioner Bowie Kuhn suggested that the rescheduled game be played on Monday night. However, the Pirates objected as they wanted the honor of hosting the first World Series night game themselves at Three Rivers Stadium when Game Four was played. Thus Game Two was played on Monday afternoon in Baltimore. =Game 3= Steve Blass With the Series shifting to Three Rivers Stadium and with Steve Blass available, the Pirates got back into it. Roberto Clemente's groundout with runners on second and third in the first put them up 1‚Äì0. Manny Sanguill√©n hit a leadoff double in the sixth and scored on Jose Pagan's single to make it 2‚Äì0 Pirates. Steve Blass pitched a complete game, allowing only three hits and one run (on a Frank Robinson home run in the seventh) and striking out eight. The big blow on offense was provided by Bob Robertson, who slammed a three-run home run in the seventh off starter Mike Cuellar‚Äîafter missing the bunt sign. Manager Danny Murtaugh issued the sign to Robertson, who had no sacrifice bunts on the season. Television replays showed Roberto Clemente, who was on second base, appearing to call a timeout, but Cuellar was already in his windup at the time. Blass was sitting next to Murtaugh in the dugout at the time, and told the Pirate manager: \\"If you fine him (Robertson, for missing the bunt sign), I'll pay.\\" Murtaugh didn't. =Game 4= Al Oliver In the first night game in World Series history, it started out looking like a long night for the Pirates. Starting pitcher Luke Walker gave up singles to the Orioles' first three batters, Paul Blair, Mark Belanger, and Merv Rettenmund, loading the bases. Blair scored and the others advanced on a Manny Sanguill√©n passed ball. Walker then intentionally walked Frank Robinson and gave up consecutive sacrifice flies to Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell, giving the Orioles a Manager Danny Murtaugh then pulled Walker in favor of Bruce Kison. Kison proceeded to get the final out of the inning and then pitched shutout baseball for the next six innings, allowing only one hit and despite hitting three Oriole batters, a World Series record. Kison's heroics allowed the Pirates to claw back off of starter Pat Dobson. Willie Stargell and Al Oliver cut the lead to in the bottom of the first with back-to-back RBI doubles after a leadoff walk. Oliver tied the score at 3 in the third with an RBI single. In the seventh, Bob Robertson and Sanguill√©n stroked one-out singles off reliever Eddie Watt. Pinch-hitter Vic Davalillo then lofted a short fly to center that Paul Blair dropped. Robertson reached third and Davalillo first, but Sanguill√©n was caught in a rundown between second and third. Backup catcher Milt May then batted for Kison and delivered a clutch go-ahead RBI single, scoring Robertson. Dave Giusti pitched the final two innings of hitless ball for the Pirates and got the save. =Game 5= Nelson Briles Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh chose Nelson Briles to start Game 5 over the Pirates' top starters, Steve Blass and Dock Ellis, choosing to save them for potential Games 6 and 7. The gamble paid off as Briles pitched an efficient two-hit shutout. Bob Robertson's leadoff home run in the second inning off Dave McNally put the Pirates up 1‚Äì0. Manny Sanguill√©n singled, stole second and scored on Nelson Briles's two-out single to bump the Pirates' lead to 2‚Äì0. A wild pitch with runners on first and third allowed another run to score to make it 3-0 after three innings. Gene Clines hit a leadoff triple in the fifth and scored on Roberto Clemente's single, his first RBI scoring hit of the series, to cap the scoring as the Pirates took a series lead heading back to Baltimore. =Game 6= Brooks Robinson The series shifted back to Baltimore with the Orioles facing elimination. With Steve Blass needing another day of rest and Dock Ellis nursing an injury, Danny Murtaugh had to go to the well once again, starting reliever Bob Moose‚Äîhis sixth different starter in this Series. Moose responded well by pitching shutout ball for five innings, while his Pirate teammates got him a 2‚Äì0 lead. Al Oliver doubled in the second off Jim Palmer and scored on a Bob Robertson single. Roberto Clemente added a homer in the third. Moose started having trouble in the sixth, however. Don Buford belted a one-out homer and Moose allowed the next two batters to reach base before giving way to Bob Johnson, who ended the threat. The Orioles tied it off Johnson in the seventh when Mark Belanger singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Davey Johnson. Both teams threatened late; the Orioles had runners on second and third in the bottom of the ninth with two out, but failed to score. The Pirates loaded the bases in the top of the tenth, but Dave McNally, pitching in relief, squelched the threat. The Orioles staved off a World Series defeat in their half of the tenth when Frank Robinson drew a one-out walk and went to third on a Merv Rettenmund single. Brooks Robinson lifted a short fly to center and Frank Robinson tagged and scored the winning run, barely beating Vic Davalillo's throw to the plate. =Game 7= Roberto Clemente With ace pitchers Steve Blass and Mike Cuellar on the mound for their respective teams, Game 7 proved to be a pitcher's duel. Series MVP Roberto Clemente drew first blood for the Pirates by hitting a two-out homer in the fourth off Cuellar. The Pirates added another run in the eighth when Jos√© Pag√°n doubled in Willie Stargell. The only run the O's could muster off Blass was an RBI groundout by Don Buford in the eighth. Blass would get his second complete game win of the series. Game 7 was the only game in which the visiting team won. It was the fourth World Series in which the home team won each of the first six games before the road team won Game 7 with the others being 1955, 1956 and 1965. After Game 2, the O's bats went silent. After hitting the Pirates pitching staff for 16 runs and 24 hits in the first two games, the O's scored only eight runs on 21 hits, hitting only .141 (21‚Äì149) in the next five games, enabling the Pirates to upset the Orioles.

It is the only English-language college in western Quebec. History What began as an offshoot of the much larger Coll√®ge de l'Outaouais, with an initial enrollment of 7 students, evolved into an official campus and eventually a college. With an ever-increasing population and a few stays in renovated buildings (including a bowling alley and a couple of French high schools), it finally achieved fully autonomous status in 1988 as Heritage College. In 1994, it opened the doors on its newly constructed, more permanent facility; just down the street from its larger sister francophone college. In 1977, when students were housed in the newly renovated √âcole Ste-Marie, a heritage building on Maisonneuve Boulevard, this branch of the French college was officially recognized as Heritage Campus. On October 16, 1994, the new Heritage College, with a student population of 900, opened.  Programs  The college offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly corresponds to an additional year of high school and what is considered the first year of university elsewhere in Canada, in preparation for a chosen field in university. Students who complete pre-university programs typically complete undergraduate degrees in three years. The technical programs, which take three-years to complete, applies to students who wish to pursue a skill trade. In addition Continuing education and services to business are provided. Heritage offers the following programs leading to a DEC: Career programs: *Accounting and Management Technology *Computer Science *Early Childhood Care and Education *Electronics Technology *New Media and Publication Design *Nursing *Hospitality and Hotel Management *Tourism Pre-University programs: *Commerce1 *Liberal Arts *Science *Social Science *Visual Arts 1Although Commerce is listed as a separate program, it is technically a profile of Social Science and thus, Graduates of Commerce receive a DEC in Social Science, not Commerce. Heritage also offers several continuing education courses, some of which lead to an AEC. Continuing Education offers various intensive day programs for adults such as Microsoft Network specialist and Bilingual Office System Administration. Night courses also are offered. Student life The Heritage College Drama Club is the Bacchus Players. S.Q.U.A.D. - Students Questing for Unity, Awareness and Diversity. Through activism, S.Q.U.A.D. is a club that wants to raise awareness for social, animal, environmental, human and political rights.

The 67th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the American League champion Baltimore Orioles (108‚Äì54 in the regular season) and the National League champion Cincinnati Reds (102‚Äì60). The Orioles won, four games to one. In this series Emmett Ashford became the first African American to umpire a World Series. It also featured the first World Series games to be played on artificial turf, as Games 1 and 2 took place at Cincinnati's first-year Riverfront Stadium. This was the last World Series in which all games were played in the afternoon. It was also the third time in a World Series in which a team leading three games to none failed to complete the sweep by losing Game 4 but still won Game 5 to clinch the series; 1910 and 1937 were the others. This was the last World Series until 2017 in which both participating teams won over 100 games during the regular season.http://m.mlb.com/news/article/259323604/astros-dodgers-have- each-won-100-plus-games/ Background The Baltimore Orioles won the American League East division by 15 games over the New York Yankees and the Cincinnati Reds won the National League West division by games over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Coming into the World Series, the Orioles had won 14 straight including the final 11 during the regular season then defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to none, in the American League Championship Series for the second straight year. The Reds went 32‚Äì30 in their last 62 regular season games, but swept the Pittsburgh Pirates, three games to none, in the National League Championship Series. This World Series set up a classic matchup of a pair of teams laden with all-star players. The 1970 Cincinnati Reds squad was the first edition of the \\"Big Red Machine.\\" Sparky Anderson's first year as a major league manager produced 102 wins and the first of four NL pennants in a seven-year stretch. The Reds featured a heavy-hitting lineup that included future Hall of Famers in catcher Johnny Bench (45 home runs, 148 RBI and .293 batting average) and third baseman Tony P√©rez (40, 129, .317), as well as all- time hits leader Pete Rose (15, 52, .316) in right field, NL stolen base leader Bobby Tolan (16, 80, .316) in center field and power-hitting first baseman Lee May (34, 94, .253). The Reds led the National League in batting average and finished third in runs scored. Cincinnati pitching, however, would be a weak spot throughout the Series. Two-time 20-game winner Jim Maloney could only make three starts during the regular season and was shelved. Two 1970 All Star game representatives, Jim Merritt (20‚Äì12) and rookie Wayne Simpson (14‚Äì3), were suffering arm injuries. Merritt, who won 20 games by the end of August, pitched less than four regular season innings after September 4. Merritt started Game 5 against Baltimore, but was unable to get through the second inning. Simpson started 8‚Äì1 and had 14 wins by July 26, but was shelved thereafter. He did not pitch in the post season. Right-hander Gary Nolan (18‚Äì7, 3.26 ERA) would assume the ace role for the Reds. By contrast, pitching was a strength for the Baltimore Orioles as manager Earl Weaver had three, healthy 20-game winners. Mike Cuellar (24‚Äì8, 3.48 ERA), Dave McNally (24‚Äì9, 3.22) and future Hall of Famer Jim Palmer (20‚Äì10, 2.71) were all well-rested and ready for the Series. Weaver balanced good pitching with the hitting of 1970 AL MVP Boog Powell (35, 114, .297), Merv Rettenmund (18, 58, .322), as well as future Hall of Famers Frank Robinson (25, 78, .306) and Brooks Robinson (18, 94, .276). The Orioles led the AL in most runs scored (792), fewest runs allowed (574), complete games (60), lowest team ERA (3.15) and they were second in the AL in fielding percentage (.981) establishing themselves as the most dominant Orioles team in the modern era. The 1970 World Series appearance by Baltimore was the second of what would be three-straight World Series appearances. The Reds would go on to amass four WS appearances in a seven-year stretch (1970, '72, '75 & '76, winning the last two). Of the four World Series Earl Weaver managed the Orioles to, the 1970 World Series was the only one that they won. They lost to the New York Mets in , and to the Pittsburgh Pirates in and . Summary Matchups =Game 1= Brooks Robinson The Reds got off to a fast start, taking a 3‚Äì0 lead off Jim Palmer on a first-inning RBI single by Johnny Bench and a third-inning two-run homer by Lee May. The Orioles' offense answered with a two-run homer by Boog Powell in the fourth inning, off Reds starter Gary Nolan. Elrod Hendricks tied it with a homer in the fifth, and Brooks Robinson hit the game-winning homer in the seventh. In the sixth, Robinson made a spectacular backhanded grab of a hard grounder down the line by May before spinning to throw him out. It was one of several spectacular plays the Gold Glove third baseman would make in the series. The game turned in the sixth inning on a controversial call by home- plate umpire Ken Burkhart. The Reds had Bernie Carbo on third and Tommy Helms on first when Ty Cline, batting for Woody Woodward, hit a high chopper in front of the plate. Burkhart positioned himself in front of the plate to call the ball fair or foul as Carbo sped home. O's catcher Hendricks fielded the ball and turned to tag Carbo with Burkhart blocking the way. Hendricks tagged the sliding Carbo with his glove hand while holding the ball in his other hand; all the while, Burkhart was knocked to the ground and had his back to the play. When Burkhart turned around, he saw Carbo out of the baseline away from the plate as Hendricks held the ball. Burkhart signaled Carbo out without asking for help from the other umpires. Replays showed Carbo may have actually missed the plate on the slide, although, unwittingly, he stood on it when he argued the \\"out\\" call. Both Carbo and Sparky Anderson vehemently argued the call, to no avail. Robinson's home run put the O's ahead for the first time, while Palmer settled into a groove on the mound. Palmer allowed no hits in his final innings of work. After he walked Pete Rose with two outs in the ninth, Pete Richert relieved Palmer and got Bobby Tolan to line out to shortstop Mark Belanger to end the game. The Jackson 5 performed \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" prior to the game, with the Lemon-Monroe High School Marching Band accompanying the group in the performance. The events were re-enacted in the 1992 miniseries The Jacksons: An American Dream, with the group performing the song a cappella. =Game 2= Boog Powell Again, another fast start by the Reds fell by the wayside. The Reds scored three in the first on a two-run double by Lee May, who went to third when Orioles center fielder Paul Blair bobbled the ball. Hal McRae squeeze-bunted May home for the third run. They pushed the lead to 4‚Äì0 on a homer by Bobby Tolan in the third. The Orioles began their comeback innocently enough on a Boog Powell solo homer in the fourth. In the fifth, the floodgates opened. With one out, Reds' starter Jim McGlothlin gave up successive singles to pinch-hitter Chico Salmon and Don Buford. Paul Blair singled home Salmon, chasing McGlothlin and bringing in Milt Wilcox. Wilcox gave up RBI singles to Powell and Brooks Robinson and the crushing blow, a two-run double to Elrod Hendricks. The Reds would get back one run in the sixth on a Johnny Bench home run, but that was it. American actor and singer Tony Martin sang the National Anthem prior to the first pitch, which was thrown out by former NL President Warren Giles. =Game 3= Brooks Robinson Left-hander Dave McNally had a banner day, pitching a complete game and scattering nine hits, while also connecting for a grand slam in the sixth inning off reliever Wayne Granger to break the game open. McNally became the first pitcher to hit a World Series grand slam. Baltimore third baseman Brooks Robinson added to his highlight reel with a spectacular display of fielding. After Pete Rose and Bobby Tolan led the game off with consecutive hits, Robinson made a sensational, leaping grab of Tony P√©rez's hopper, stepped on third and fired to first for a double play. In the second inning, Robinson snagged a slow grounder hit by Tommy Helms and threw out the sprinting second baseman. And in the sixth, Robinson made a diving catch of a line drive by Johnny Bench. The Memorial Stadium fans gave Robinson a standing ovation as he came to bat in the bottom of the sixth. He responded by doubling to left. The Orioles got two runs in the first on Brooks Robinson's bases- loaded double off of Tony Cloninger. The Reds cut it to 2‚Äì1 in the second when Hal McRae singled, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Dave Concepcion's single, but Frank Robinson's home run in the third gave the Orioles that run back. Don Buford's home run in the fifth extended their lead to 4‚Äì1. Next inning Dave McNally's grand slam off of Wayne Granger blew the game open and put the Orioles up 8‚Äì1. The Reds got two runs in the seventh on Dave Concepcion's sacrifice fly and Pete Rose's RBI single, but the Orioles got a run in the bottom half on Paul Blair's RBI double off of Don Gullett. The Orioles took a commanding 3‚Äì0 series lead with a 9‚Äì3 win. =Game 4= Lee May The Reds staved off a Series sweep thanks to clutch hitting by Lee May and stellar relief pitching by rookie Don Gullett and veteran Clay Carroll. With a 2‚Äì1 lead in the third, Reds' starter Gary Nolan gave up two-out RBI singles to Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson. Gullett relieved Nolan and surrendered another RBI single to Elrod Hendricks. The Reds crept back in the fifth on a homer by Pete Rose. Gullett gave up an unearned run in the sixth when Hendricks singled Brooks Robinson to third and Robinson scored when Rose's attempted throw from right field sailed past Tony P√©rez at third. In the eighth, Perez walked and Johnny Bench singled off Baltimore starter Jim Palmer, who was then relieved by Eddie Watt. Lee May then slammed a three-run homer on the first pitch he saw from Watt to put the Reds ahead. Carroll, who had entered in the seventh, made the lead stand. Gullett and Carroll combined to pitch innings, allowing four hits and one unearned run. The Reds' victory snapped Baltimore's 17-game winning streak which included the final 11 regular-season games and a three-game sweep over Minnesota in the ALCS. It also ended Cincinnati's six-game World Series losing streak, including the last three games in the 1961 World Series. =Game 5= Merv Rettenmund Rain showers threatened to delay game 5, but it scarcely kept the Memorial Stadium crowd from being less than capacity. Seemingly re-energized from their game 4 win, the Reds rocked Orioles starter Mike Cuellar for three runs in the first on an RBI single by Johnny Bench and a two-run double by Hal McRae. Cuellar stayed in the game and got Tommy Helms to ground out to Mark Belanger for the final out. The Orioles scored two runs in the bottom of the first against Reds' 20-game winner Jim Merritt, who had been battling a sore arm and had not pitched in 10 days. Merritt allowed more two runs in the second inning before being lifted. Frank Robinson hit a two-run home run, Merv Rettenmund also had a homer and two RBI, and Davey Johnson had two RBI to pace the Orioles' attack. After the rocky first inning, Cuellar settled down and allowed no runs and two hits in the final eight innings for a complete-game victory. Brooks Robinson won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award hitting .429, broke the record for total bases in a five-game series with 17, tied the record for most hits in one game with four, and tied teammate Paul Blair for most hits in a five-game Series with nine. Total Baseball described Brooks Robinson's fielding with, \\"other-worldly defense at third (which) gave Reds right-handed hitters nightmares through the Series.\\" Upon hearing that Robinson won the MVP award and a new car from Toyota, Reds' catcher Johnny Bench said, \\"If we had known he wanted a car that badly, we'd all have chipped in and bought him one.\\" The victory was redemption for Baltimore, who had lost to the underdog New York Mets in the 1969 World Series. The game was the last in the majors for Ashford, who became the first black umpire to work at the top level of baseball, when he was hired by the American League in 1966. Ashford reached MLB's then-mandatory retirement age of 55 in late 1969, but was allowed by AL president Joe Cronin to come back for 1970, giving him the opportunity to break the World Series color barrier for umpires. A black umpire did not call balls and strikes in a World Series game until 1993, when the NL's Charlie Williams worked the plate in Game 4. This World Series was the first in which both teams wore their last names on the backs of their uniforms. =Composite line score= 1970 World Series (4‚Äì1): Baltimore Orioles (A.L.) over Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) Aftermath This was the second of three consecutive appearances by the Orioles, who went on to lose the following year's World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates 4‚Äì3. Baltimore won both the Super Bowl and the World Series in the same season as the Baltimore Colts won Super Bowl V over the Dallas Cowboys. However, the city fell short of winning MLB, NFL and NBA championships within a one-year span as the Baltimore Bullets were swept by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1971 NBA Finals. Such a scenario is now unlikely as the Bullets have since relocated to Washington, D.C. and renamed the Wizards. For the Reds, this was the first of four World Series appearances in the 1970s. After losing to the Oakland Athletics four games to three in , they proceeded to win back-to-back championships in (4‚Äì3 vs. the Red Sox) and (4‚Äì0 vs. the Yankees).

He played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons and spent his entire career with the Raiders franchise in Oakland and Los Angeles. During his tenure as a player, Long was named to eight Pro Bowls and helped the Los Angeles Raiders win a championship in Super Bowl XVIII in 1984. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000. After retiring, Long pursued a career in acting and broadcasting and serves as a studio analyst for Fox Sports' NFL coverage. He is the father of former NFL defensive end Chris Long and former NFL guard Kyle Long. Early years Born in Somerville, Massachusetts, Long was raised in Charlestown, Boston, primarily by uncles and maternal grandmother. He attended Milford High School in Milford, and is a member of the Milford Hall of Fame. Long was an all-around athlete, playing football (lettered three years and was named to the Scholastic Coach All-America team as a senior, although he had never played football until age 15), basketball (lettered three years as a forward), and track (lettered three years, competing in the shot put, discus, and javelin). Long also set state records in the shot put and discus. College career Long played college football at Villanova University near Philadelphia and earned a degree in communications. A four-year letterman for the Wildcats, he was selected to play in the Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic and was named the MVP in 1980. As a freshman, Long started every game and had 99 tackles. As a sophomore in 1978, Long led Villanova in sacks with five and recorded 78 tackles. The next season, Long sustained a thigh injury, missed three games, and ended the season with 46 tackles. As a senior in 1980, Long again led the Wildcats with four sacks and had 84 tackles. He began as a tight end but was moved to the defensive line, playing mostly nose guard his first two seasons. After moving to defensive end, he earned All-East honors and was honorable mention All-American in his senior year.1982 Los Angeles Raiders Media Guide Long also boxed at Villanova and was the Northern Collegiate Heavyweight Boxing Champion. Professional career Selected in the second round of the 1981 NFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders, Long would play 13 seasons for the club, wearing the number 75. On the Raiders defensive line, Long earned eight Pro Bowl selections. He had high aspirations early in his career. He told Football Digest in 1986 that he wanted \\"Financial security, and I want to be in the Hall of Fame. That's my goal. And I'd like to win a few more Super Bowls.\\" Along the way, he was also named first team All-Pro three times (in 1983, '84, and '85) and second team All-Pro twice (in 1986 and 1989). He was selected by John Madden to the All-Madden teams in 1984 and 1985 and was named to the 10th Anniversary All-Madden team in 1994. Long was voted the NFL Alumni Defensive Lineman of the Year and the NFLPA AFC Defensive Lineman of the Year in 1985. He capped off a stellar 1985 season earning the George S. Halas Trophy for having been voted the NEA's co-NFL Defensive Player of the Year (along with Andre Tippett). He was also named the Seagrams' Seven Crown NFL Defensive Player of the year. The following year, Long was voted the Miller Lite NFL Defensive Lineman of the Year. Both those awards were taken by polls of NFL players. In 1986, Long was voted to his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl and was key in helping the Raiders record 63 sacks and being the number one defense in the AFC. From 1983-86 the Raiders defense recorded 249 sacks, which tied with the Chicago Bears for tops in the NFL over that span. Long collected 91 sacks during his career (7 are not official, as sacks were not an official statistic during his rookie year). His career high was in 1983 with 13 sacks, including a career-high five against the Washington Redskins on October 2, 1983. He also intercepted two passes and recovered 10 fumbles during his 13-year career. At the time of his retirement, he was the last player still with the team who had been a Raider before the franchise moved to Los Angeles. He won the Super Bowl XVIII title as the left defensive end with the Raiders (1983 season), beating the Washington Redskins, as he outplayed the opposing offensive tackle, George Starke; the vaunted Redskin running game led by John Riggins had only 90 yards in 32 rush attempts. Long's signature defensive move was the \\"rip,\\" which employed a quick, uppercut-like motion designed to break an opposing blocker's grip. Pro Football Weekly (PFW) named Long as one of the ends on its All-time 3-4 defensive front, along with Lee Roy Selmon, Curley Culp, Lawrence Taylor, Andre Tippett, Randy Gradishar, and Harry Carson. PFW based its \\"Ultimate 3-4\\" team on the vote of over 40 former NFL players, coaches, and scouts. After football After his retirement from the NFL following the 1993 season, Long pursued an acting career, focused mainly on action films‚Äîincluding Firestorm, a 1998 feature in which he starred. He also appeared as a co-star in the suspense movie Broken Arrow, alongside star John Travolta. He played a minor role in the movie 3000 Miles to Graceland alongside Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell and Courteney Cox.

Long also made numerous cameo appearances on TV shows and commercials. Long was a spokesman for Radio Shack, making commercials with actress Teri Hatcher. He has also been featured in many other national commercials and advertising campaigns including those of Coors Light, Nike, Campbell's Chunky Soup, Hanes, Frito Lay, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Nabisco, Kraft, the Bud Bowl campaign, Honda and currently for Chevrolet. In March 1986, Long told Inside Sports, \\"When I'm finished playing, I'd like to stay in touch with football, through broadcasting. I'm qualified to give a certain perspective and I'm articulate enough to handle it.\\" After his retirement, he began as a studio analyst for the Fox Network's NFL coverage where he often plays the \\"straight man\\" to the comic antics of co- host Terry Bradshaw and he writes a column for Foxsports.com.Foxsports column archive In addition, he hosts an annual award show on Fox, Howie Long's Tough Guys, which honors the NFL players whom he deems the toughest and gives \\"the toughest\\" a Chevrolet truck.

Family background  Cecil Knox was born in Nuneaton in 1889, the son of James and Florence Knox. The family were prominent in civil and railway engineering and had become affluent through their majority shareholding in the Haunchwood Brick and Tile Company. James was one of nine sons who all fought in the First World War. James Meldrum Knox of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was awarded the DSO & bar, and T. K. Knox gained the Military Cross and bar.

The 66th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Baltimore Orioles and the National League (NL) champion New York Mets. The Mets won the series, four games to one, to accomplish one of the greatest upsets in Series history, as that particular Orioles team was considered to be one of the finest ever. The World Series win earned the team the sobriquets \\"The Amazin' Mets\\" and \\"The Miracle Mets\\", as they had risen from the depths of mediocrity (the 1969 team had the first winning record in Mets history). This was the first World Series of MLB's divisional era. The Mets became the first expansion team to win a division title, a pennant, and the World Series, winning in their eighth year of existence, becoming the fastest expansion team to win a World Series up to that point. Two teams eventually surpassed the latter record, as the Florida Marlins won the 1997 World Series in their fifth year (also becoming the first wild card team to win a World Series) and the Arizona Diamondbacks won the 2001 World Series in their fourth year of play. The 1969 World Series was the first World Series since to have games played in New York that did not involve the New York Yankees; it was also the first World Series in which neither the New York Giants nor Brooklyn Dodgers (as both teams had moved to California in 1958) represented New York from the NL; all subsequent World Series with a New York-area NL team participating have involved the Mets, who have been the only NL baseball team located in New York City since that era. Route to the World Series =New York Mets= The New York Mets, who had never finished higher than ninth place (next-to-last) nor won more than 73 games in a season since joining the National League in 1962, were not highly regarded before the 1969 season started. In fact, the best that could be said for them was that because the National League was being split into two divisions that year (as was the American League), the Mets were guaranteed to finish no lower than sixth place. The fact that the Mets began the season by losing 11‚Äì10 to the then- expansion Montreal Expos seemed to confirm this. With three weeks to go in the season, the underdog Mets stormed past the Chicago Cubs, who had led the Eastern Division for most of the season, winning 38 of their final 49 games for a total of 100 wins and becoming the first National League Eastern Division champions. Third-year pitcher Tom Seaver won a major-league-leading 25 games en route to his first Cy Young Award; the other two top Mets starting pitchers, Jerry Koosman and rookie Gary Gentry, combined to win 30 more games. Outfielder Cleon Jones hit a (then) club-record .340 and finished third in the National League batting race, while his lifelong friend and outfield mate Tommie Agee hit 26 home runs and drove in 76 runs to lead the club; they were the only players on the team who garnered more than 400 at bats. Manager Gil Hodges also employed a platoon system like the Yankees of the Casey Stengel era, in which Ron Swoboda and Art Shamsky became a switch-hitting right fielder who hit 23 home runs and drove in 100 runs, and Ed Kranepool and Donn Clendenon added up to a switch-hitting first baseman who hit 23 more homers and knocked in another 95 runs. In the first League Championship Series, the normally light-hitting Mets, once again considered underdogs despite having a better regular-season record than their opponent, put on a power display by scoring 27 runs in sweeping the favored Atlanta Braves in three games. =Baltimore Orioles= The Baltimore Orioles, by contrast, were practically flawless and featured stars at almost every position. They breezed through the 1969 season, winning 109 games (the most games won since the 1961 Yankees) and became the first American League Eastern Division champions by 19 games, then brushing aside the Minnesota Twins three games to none in the ALCS to win their second pennant in four years. The Orioles were led by star sluggers Frank Robinson and Boog Powell, who each hit over 30 home runs and drove in over 100 runs; third baseman Brooks Robinson, perhaps the best-fielding hot- corner player in baseball history; and pitchers Mike Cuellar, Dave McNally, and Jim Palmer, who combined for 63 victories. Summary Matchups =Game 1= Don Buford Don Buford hit Tom Seaver's second pitch of the game for a home run, which just evaded Ron Swoboda's leaping attempt at catching it. The O's then added three more runs in the fourth when, with two outs, Elrod Hendricks singled and Davey Johnson walked. Mark Belanger then singled in a run, followed by an RBI single by pitcher Mike Cuellar. Buford capped the inning off by doubling in Belanger. The Mets got their run in the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Al Weis. Orioles starter Mike Cuellar was the winner, allowing just that run in a complete-game effort. Despite the opening-game loss, nobody on the Mets was discouraged. Tom Seaver ‚Äì the game's losing pitcher ‚Äì said years later \\"I swear, we came into the clubhouse more confident than when we had left it. Somebody ‚Äì I think it was Clendenon ‚Äì yelled out, 'Dammit, we can beat these guys!' And we believed it. A team knows if they've been badly beaten or outplayed. And we felt we hadn't been. The feeling wasn't that we had lost, but Hey, we nearly won that game! We hadn't been more than a hit or two from turning it around. It hit us like a ton of bricks.\\" =Game 2= Jerry Koosman Mets pitcher Jerry Koosman pitched six innings of no-hit ball, trying to match Don Larsen's World Series no-hit feat. Donn Clendenon provided him a slim lead with a home run in the fourth. However, Koosman lost the no-hitter and the lead in the seventh inning as Paul Blair singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Brooks Robinson. But that was it for the Orioles' offense. The Mets pushed across a run in the top of the ninth on back-to-back-to-back singles by Ed Charles, Jerry Grote, and Al Weis, the latter scoring Charles. This proved to be the decisive run, and Orioles starter Dave McNally had the tough-luck loss. Koosman had trouble finishing the game, as he issued two-out walks in the bottom of the ninth to Frank Robinson and Boog Powell. Ron Taylor came on to retire Brooks Robinson for the final out and earn the save. The first pitch was one hour later than usual due to a Baltimore ordinance, since repealed, which prohibited Sunday sporting events from beginning prior to 2 p.m. This also occurred in game 4 of the 1966 World Series. =Game 3= Ed Kranepool Agee led off the game for the Mets with a home run off Jim Palmer, then saved at least five runs with his defense. With two out in the fourth and Oriole runners on first and third, Agee raced to the sign in left-center and made a backhanded running catch of a drive hit by Elrod Hendricks. In the seventh, the Orioles had the bases loaded with two out, but Agee made a headfirst diving grab of a line drive hit by Paul Blair in right-center. Ed Kranepool added a home run and Jerry Grote an RBI double for the Mets, while Gary Gentry pitched 6‚Öî shutout innings and helped his own cause with a second inning two-run double. Nolan Ryan, making his only World Series appearance of his 27-year career, pitched the final 2‚Öì innings (benefiting from Agee's second catch) and earned a save. =Game 4= Tom Seaver Game 4 was mired in controversy. Tom Seaver's photograph was used on some anti-war Moratorium Day literature being distributed outside Shea Stadium before the game, although the pitcher claimed that his picture was used without his knowledge or approval. A further controversy that day involved the flying of the American flag at Shea Stadium. New York City Mayor John Lindsay had ordered flags flown at half staff to observe the Moratorium Day and honor those who had died in Vietnam. Many were concerned, including 225 wounded servicemen who were attending the game, and Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn announced that the American flag would be flown at full staff at Shea for Game 4. Tom Seaver atoned for his Game 1 ineffectiveness by shutting the Orioles out through eight innings. Once again, Donn Clendenon provided the lead with a homer in the second off Game 1 winner Mike Cuellar, who allowed just that run over seven solid innings. In the third inning, after arguing ball-strike calls too strenuously with plate umpire Shag Crawford, Earl Weaver of the Orioles became the first manager since 1935 to be ejected from a World Series game. In the top of the ninth, Seaver ran into trouble. Frank Robinson and Boog Powell hit back-to-back one-out singles to put runners on first and third. Brooks Robinson then hit a sinking line drive towards right that Mets right fielder Ron Swoboda dove for and caught just inches off the ground. Frank Robinson tagged and scored, but Swoboda's heroics kept the Orioles from possibly taking the lead. Elrod Hendricks then flew out to Swoboda to end the inning. In the bottom of the tenth, Jerry Grote led off by blooping a double to left. Al Weis was intentionally walked to set up a force play and get to the pitcher's spot in the lineup. Mets manager Gil Hodges sent J. C. Martin up to hit for Seaver. Martin laid down a sacrifice bunt, but Orioles reliever Pete Richert hit Martin in the wrist with his throw to first, and the ball went down the right field line. Rod Gaspar, running for Grote, came around to score the winning run. Replays showed Martin running inside the first-base line, which appeared to hinder Richert's ability to make a good throw and Orioles second baseman Davey Johnson from catching it. Subsequent controversy focused on MLB rule 6.05 (k), which says that a batter shall be out‚Äîwith the ball dead and the runners returned to their original bases‚Äîif \\"...In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base, while the ball is being fielded to first base, he runs outside (to the right of) the three-foot line, or inside (to the left of) the foul line, and in the umpire's judgment in so doing interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first base.\\" The umpires' judgment was that Martin did not interfere. =Game 5= Donn Clendenon Dave McNally shut out the Mets through five innings and helped himself with a two-run homer in the third inning. Frank Robinson homered in the inning as well, and the Orioles looked to be cruising with a 3‚Äì0 lead. The Mets, however, benefited from two questionable umpire's calls. In the top of the sixth inning, Mets starting pitcher Jerry Koosman appeared to have hit Frank Robinson with a pitch, but plate umpire Lou DiMuro ruled that the pitch hit his bat before hitting him and denied him first base. Replays showed, however, that Robinson was indeed hit first ‚Äî the ball struck him on the hip, then bounced up and hit his bat. In the bottom of the sixth, McNally bounced a pitch that appeared to have hit Mets left fielder Cleon Jones on the foot, then bounced into the Mets' dugout. McNally and the Orioles claimed the ball hit the dirt and not Jones, but Mets manager Gil Hodges showed the ball to DiMuro, who found a spot of shoe polish on the ball and awarded Jones first base. McNally then gave up Series MVP Donn Clendenon's third homer of the series (a record for a five-game World Series that was tied by the Phillies' Ryan Howard in the 2008 Classic and by Boston‚Äôs Steve Pearce in the 2018 Series) to cut the lead to 3‚Äì2. However, the renowned \\"shoe polish\\" incident may not be such a simple, straightforward matter. On August 22, 2009, at the 40th anniversary celebration of the Mets' 1969 Championship, held at their new stadium, Citi Field, Jerry Koosman stated in several media interviews that, in actuality, Hodges had instructed him to rub the ball on his shoe, which he did, and after that Hodges showed the ball to the umpire. Koosman's claim doesn't necessarily mean that the ball didn't strike Jones on the foot, nor does it even mean that the polish on the ball seen by the umpire was put there by Koosman ‚Äî it's certainly conceivable that there was already a genuine spot of polish on the ball, which easily could have escaped Koosman's notice as he hastily created the fraudulent one. In any case, Koosman's allegation at the very least adds an intriguing layer of uncertainty and possible chicanery to an already legendary event. Koosman was known for his sense of humor, and his love of practical jokes when he was an active player. Therefore, his claim of having scuffed the ball against his own shoe could be a ruse. Besides, there are other stories which have been told about that incident, by other players who were in the Mets dugout that day. One of those stories comes from Ron Swoboda, who said during an interview on the Mets 1986 25th Anniversary video, that when the ball came bounding into the Mets dugout, it hit an open ball bag under the bench, and several batting / infield practice balls came spilling out on the dugout floor. According to Swoboda, you couldn't distinguish the actual game ball from any of the ones that spilled out of the bag. Hodges quickly looked down, grabbed a ball that had a black streak on it, and walked it out to the home plate umpire, who then awarded first base to Jones. In any case, this incident provided baseball with yet another entertaining legend, about which the absolute truth will probably never be known. The Mets then tied the score in the seventh on a home run by the unheralded and light- hitting Al Weis. Weis hit only seven home runs in his big league career; this was the only home run he hit at Shea Stadium and, in fact, was the only home run he hit playing for the home team in any major league park. Weis led all batters in the series with a .455 average. The winning runs scored in the eighth as Game 4 defensive hero Ron Swoboda doubled in Jones with the go-ahead run. Swoboda then scored when Jerry Grote's grounder was mishandled by first baseman Boog Powell, whose throw to first was then dropped by pitcher Eddie Watt in an unusual double error. Jerry Koosman got the win, his second of the series. With two outs in the top of the ninth inning, Koosman faced Orioles second baseman Davey Johnson (who, coincidentally, later managed the Mets to their second World Series championship in 1986). After taking a pitch of two balls and one strike, Johnson hit a fly-ball out to left field which was caught by Cleon Jones.New York Mets Win 1969 ‚Äì YouTube After a shaky third inning, Koosman settled down to retire 19 of the next 21 batters he faced, giving up a single and a walk. Karl Ehrhardt, a Mets fan known as \\"the sign man\\" at Shea Stadium, held up a sign that read There Are No Words soon after the final out was made. The sign made an appearance in the Series highlight film. Immediately following the victory, thousands of fans rushed onto the field and the Mets were forced to retreat to their locker room. Bill Gleason, a sports columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times, alleged that this feat would not repeated again until Disco Demolition Night,Disco Demolition ‚Äì Thirty Years Ago! ‚Äì YouTube an event which saw many people rush onto the playing field in Comiskey Park just before the second game of a doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and Detroit Tigers was scheduled to begin on July 12, 1979. In all four Mets victories, their starting first baseman hit a home run: Donn Clendenon in Games 2, 4 and 5, and Ed Kranepool in Game 3. The expression, \\"Good pitching defeats good hitting\\", was never more evident than in this World Series; Baltimore collected only 23 hits for a .146 batting average, both team lows for a 5-game series. After losing Game 1 in which the Orioles had only six hits, Baltimore only managed a .134 batting average (17-for-127) over the next four games. Boog Powell led the Orioles with five hits and a .263 average‚Äîbut all were non-scoring singles (although one advanced Frank Robinson to third base to set up Swoboda's defensive heroics). Don Buford collected two hits in four at-bats in the opening game, including a lead-off home run against Tom Seaver, but went 0-for-16 over the next four games. Paul Blair went 2-for-20, Davey Johnson 1-for-16, Frank Robinson 3-for-16, Brooks Robinson 1-for-19, and Mark Belanger 3-for-15. The Orioles offense only managed four extra-base hits off Mets pitching in the five-game series, all in the first and last games. The Mets won despite below-average performances from Jerry Grote, who went 4-for-19, Tommie Agee, who went 3-for-18, Cleon Jones, who went 3-for-19, Bud Harrelson, who went 3-for-17 and Ed Charles, who went 2-for-15. Aftermath and legacy Commissioner's Trophy on display at Citi Field in 2010 A New Yorker taking part in the World Series parade The 1969 series was the second major upset by a New York team over a Baltimore team in a sport's championship event in 1969. Earlier in January, the Jets, led by Joe Namath, upset the heavily favored Baltimore Colts in the Super Bowl, which also aired on NBC. Both the Jets and Mets called Shea Stadium home at the time. In addition, the New York Knicks eliminated the Baltimore Bullets from the 1969 NBA Playoffs; they also defeated the Bullets in en route to their first championship. As a result, New York became the first city to hoist a World Series and NBA championship within a year's span. There are several direct connections between the two Mets World Championship teams of 1969 and 1986. Orioles second baseman Davey Johnson flied out to Cleon Jones for the last out of the 1969 World Series; Johnson later managed the 1986 Mets to their World Series title. The pitcher on the mound for the last out of the 1986 Series, Jesse Orosco, had been traded to the Mets for Jerry Koosman (the pitcher on the mound for the last out of the 1969 Series) after the 1978 season. 1969 Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson earned a second World Series ring as the club's third-base coach in 1986. However, Mets pitcher Tom Seaver was on the losing end in 1986, as a member of the Boston Red Sox (he did not appear in the 1986 World Series due to a knee injury). Also in 1986, the Mets' World Series championship was in conjunction with a Super Bowl win, this time by the New York Giants, who defeated the Denver Broncos, 39‚Äì20, to win Super Bowl XXI. The Orioles repeated as AL East champs the next season, when they won 108 games, one fewer than the previous year. In the ALCS, they swept the Minnesota Twins for the second straight year to return to the World Series, this time, they were victorious in five games over the Cincinnati Reds. Four years later, the Mets returned to the World Series despite an 82‚Äì79 record, but lost to the Oakland Athletics in seven games. In a 1999 episode of Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray and his brother Robert travel to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to see a ceremony honoring the 1969 Mets. The episode ends with the brothers singing \\"Meet the Mets.\\" This series is a major plot point in the 2000 film Frequency and is also a plot point in the 2012 movie Men in Black 3. In a Batman '66 story that crosses over with the Legion of Super-Heroes, Egghead goes to the future and refuses to trust the future museums because they say the Mets win the 1969 World Series. Composite box 1969 World Series (4‚Äì1): New York Mets (N.L.) over Baltimore Orioles (A.L.) Broadcast coverage NBC televised the Series, with Curt Gowdy sharing play-by-play commentary with Orioles announcer Bill O'Donnell (for the games in Baltimore) and Mets announcer Lindsey Nelson (for the games in New York). Tony Kubek served as field reporter and in-stands interviewer. Jim Simpson hosted pre- game coverage along with Sandy Koufax and Mickey Mantle. NBC Radio also broadcast the games, with Simpson splitting play-by-play with Mets announcer Ralph Kiner (for the games in Baltimore) and O'Donnell (for the games in New York). Games 3, 4 and 5 of the 1969 Series are believed to be the oldest surviving color television broadcasts of World Series games (even though World Series telecasts have aired in color since ). These are master \\"truck feeds\\" preserved by NBC, which do not contain original commercials, but show a static image of the Shea Stadium field between innings. Also, the surviving copy of Game 5 as aired on MLB Network in late 2009 had noticeable drop-outs and tape- tracking errors for the first few innings. It is unknown if these artifacts derive from the original master-tape, or the copy used by MLB Network. All of Game 4, and part of Game 5 have been commercially released on DVD. Games 1 and 2 only survive as black-and-white kinescopes preserved by the CBC, which aired the series in Canada using the NBC feeds. Copies of all five broadcasts circulate among collectors.

Lomax defined Cantometrics as the study of singing as normative expressive behavior and maintained that Cantometrics reveals folk performance style to be a \\"systems-maintaining framework\\" which models key patterns of co-action in everyday life. His work on Cantometrics gave rise to further comparative studies of aspects of human communication in relation to culture, including: Choreometrics, Parlametrics, Phonotactics (an analysis of vowel frequency in speech), and Minutage (a study of breath management). Instead of the traditional Western musicological descriptive criteria of pitch, rhythm, and harmony, Cantometrics employs 37 style factors developed by Lomax and his team in consultation with specialists in linguistics, otolaryngology and voice therapy. The vocal style factors were designed to be easily rated by observers on a five-point scale according to their presence or absence. They include, for example: group cohesion in singing; orchestral organization; tense or relaxed vocal quality; breathiness; short or long phrases; rasp (vocal grating, such as associated, for example with the singing of Louis Armstrong); presence and percentage of vocables versus meaningful words); and melisma (ornamentation), to name a few. In the early stages of his work on the Cantometrics coding system, Lomax wrote of the relationship of musical style to culture: > \\"Its fundamental diagnostic traits appear to be vocal quality (color, > timbre, normal pitch, attack, type of melodic ornamentation, etc.) and the > degree in which song is normally monodic or polyphonic. The determinative > socio-psychological factors seem to be . . . the type of social > organization, the pattern of erotic life, and the treatment of children.... > I myself believe that the voice quality is the root [diagnostic] element. > From this socio-psychological complex there seem to arise a complex of > habitual musical practices which we call musical style\\"Cantometrics: Concept > of Style History of the theory Lomax first publicly proposed the Cantometrics project in 1959 and launched a group project in conjunction with the Anthropology Department at Columbia University to implement his vision. Early collaborators included musicologist Victor Grauer, who was the first co- creator with Lomax of the Cantometrics computer coding system. Subsequent project members included distinguished Columbia University anthropologist Conrad M. Arensberg,Author of the pathbreaking ethnographic classic, The Irish Countryman: An Anthropological Study, (1937), Arensberg helped shift the focus of anthropology from the study of exotic primitive peoples to the examination of complex modern societies.

In 1968 Lomax's research team published a book, Folk Song Style and Culture, in which they stated that, \\"for the first time, predictable and universal relationships have been established between the expressive and communication processes, on the one hand, and social structure and culture pattern, on the other\\". Gideon D'Arcangelo, a member of the Cantometrics team, described their work this way: > Using 37 criteria of observation, the Cantometrics team analyzed over 4,000 > songs ‚Äì around 10 representative songs from over 400 cultures. Each song > profile they made was recorded on a computer punch-card and loaded onto the > Columbia mainframe.

These were presented to the American > Association of Science (1966) and later published in the collaborative > volume, Folk Song Style and Culture (1968).Gideon D'Arcangelo, \\"Alan Lomax > and the Big Story of Sound\\" in liner notes to The Alan Lomax Popular Song > Book Rounder CD 82161-1863-1 (2003) Results The Cantometric study of song revealed strong statistical relations between song style and social norms. Alan Lomax stated that the Cantometrics analysis amply justified his original hypothesis that sexually restrictive and highly punitive societies correlated with degree of vocal tension. The tendency to sing together in groups, tonal cohesiveness, and the likelihood of polyphonic singing were all associated with fewer restrictions on women. Multipart singing occurs in societies where the sexes have a complementary relationship. Other results included strong correlations between length of phrase and precision of articulation, and degree of ornamentation with social stratification. It was found that explicitness or the information load of song varies with the level of economic productivity of the subsistence system. Murdock's taxonomy encoded the economic, social, and political features of more than 1,100 societies that ethnologists had studied up until that time. In many cases, these codes formed scales ‚Äì for example, the one concerning the number of levels of political authority outside the local community, from 0 among hunters, to 4 for irrigation empires. Lomax and Arensberg arranged the codes into scales in order to measure the kinds of behaviors of features of culture, such as levels of production or permanence of settlement. When they added factors of expressive communication to the Murdock measures of social relations it produced a geographical taxonomy of human culture. Branching out into Choreometrics Three chapters of Folk Song Style and Culture are devoted to Choreometrics. In chapter ten, \\"Dance, Style, and Culture,\\" Lomax, Bartenieff, and Paulay describe the origin and meaning of the term: \\"In order to distinguish the level of this comparative study of movement from the levels where previous investigators have worked, we have given the method a freshly-coined designation, Choreometrics, meaning the measure of dance, or dance as a measure of culture.\\".Lomax (1968), p. 223 They wrote that: > Choreometrics tests the proposition that dance is the most repetitious, > redundant, and formally organized system of body communication present in a > culture... The dance is composed of those gestures, postures, movements, and > movement qualities most characteristic and most essential to the activity of > everyday, and thus crucial to cultural continuity. By treating these > elements redundantly and formally, dance becomes an effective organizer of > joint motor activity. Dance supplies the metronome to meter and regulates, > or orders the energy and attention of groups of people, and thereby acquires > the weight of general community approval. Thus dance functions to establish > and renew consensus at moments when a society, without further discussion or > explanation, is ready to act in concert.Lomax et al. (1968) p. 224. Bartenieff believed that dance (particularly traditional dance) was uniquely suited to Lomax's type of analysis, since movement is \\"not only a medium of expression but also the essence of communication. Although all dancers feel intuitively that movement communicates across culture barriers, she wrote, there have hitherto been no means for describing dance patterns so that they could be consistently compared cross-culturally: > \\"The task on which we collaborated with Mr. Lomax was to adapt the Laban > system to the problem of comparison of movement styles cross-culturally so > that the main style families would emerge from the study of this visually > perceived behavior on film, as in Cantometrics they had been found by study > of aurally perceived behavior.\\" Irmgard Bartenieff, \\"Research in > Anthropology: A Study of Dance Styles in Primitive Cultures\\", Cord Dance > Research Annual I (1967). Films A series of short documentary films demonstrated some of the results of the team's statistical analysis in dramatic visual terms.A book that Lomax and Paulay wrote about their findings remains in manuscript. These were: Dance & Human History (1974) (40 min.), which examined two important parameters in the Choreometric study, the dominant trace form of the movement and single/multiple articulation of the torso and relates them to geography and type of society; Palm Play (1977) (27 min.), which examines the use of the palm in dance cross culturally; Step Style (1977) (30 min.), which examines the use of the foot in dance cross culturally;An excerpt from Lomax's film Step Style appeared in the online edition of the New York Times of January 31, 2012. and The Longest Trail (1984) (59 min.), which uses Choreometric data as evidence that the Americas were populated by Siberian hunters. In 2009 all four films were included on the DVD Rhythms of Earth: The Choreometrics Films of Alan Lomax and Forrestine Paulay produced by John Melville Bishop (Media- Generation, 1974‚Äì2008), which included old and new interviews with the original participants of the study.Robert L. Welsch, in his 2009 review of the DVD in Visual Anthropology, 22:241-242, 2009., cautioned that the films, some of them over 35 years old, now appear dated and warned that the late Robert Gardner, in one of the DVD's special features, was shown chain smoking, nevertheless he judged that students in introductory courses would find the material \\"dazzling\\" and pronounced the DVD \\"must-see for more advanced courses in expressive culture, visual anthropology, and any course involving ethnographic film.\\" Improvisational jazz musician and composer Roswell Rudd later collaborated with Lomax and Paulay on an unpublished study called the Urban Strain that used Cantometric and Choreometric analysis to study commercially produced twentieth-century American popular music and dance. Criticisms and responses The reaction of musicologists to Cantometrics was complex, as some critics questioned whether one could ever have enough statistics to prove anything about music and culture. One, Richard Middleton, called it an example of sociological homology. The musical examples for Cantometrics had not been chosen randomly, however, but for their representativeness, following the scholarly guidance of specialists who had studied the regions and /or supplied the audio or film clip samples. This was done because it was found that style tends to be very repetitive, and in most instances relatively few examples captured the stable performance norms, so that in most cases, coding many examples per culture yielded little new information. Lomax and Grauer settled on about ten examples per culture for Cantometrics, which had the largest dataset. Ten examples per culture usually sufficed, although for some cultures one or more sub-styles needed to be sampled as well. Alan Lomax himself stressed repeatedly that completeness of sampling was not the point: > The adequacy of any of these samples is . . . subject to this test: Will > another sample of a similar kind taken in the same culture produce a similar > performance profile? From this point of view, I believe that the majority of > our samples will hold up. Even \\"secret\\" songs generally tend to be > stylistically close to the more familiar music of a culture. The truth is > that, with any one culture or subculture, singing is a rather standardized > kind of behavior. It must be so since a main function of song is to . . . > permit groups of performers to vocalize together and their listeners to > share in a common experience. Cantometrics is a study of these standardized > models, which describe singing rather than songs. Therefore, it is not > primarily concerned with \\"complete\\" collections and descriptions, as are > most scholarly endeavors, but with locating verifiable regularities and > patterns. (Lomax [1968] 2000). Victor Grauer noted that: ‚ÄúCantometrics is a statistical method. Its patterns and correlations are based on multiple instances, not just one. There will always be exceptions, which is why statistical methods are generally preferable for comparative studies than the close examination of individual examples.‚ÄùVictor Grauer, \\"Song and Social Culture, A Response\\", Musical Traditions web magazine, July 27, 2005. Cantometrics as an educational tool The Cantometrics team also created a set of teaching tapes that make it easy to develop an understanding of world music and to create new song profiles. ‚ÄúCantometrics helps you to break music down into its parts,‚Äù Roswell Rudd told Gideon D‚ÄôArcangelo. ‚ÄúYou want to know how it‚Äôs put together and then you want to know where the parts came from. The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music ‚Äì any kind of music from any culture.‚ÄùRoswell Rudd, quoted in Gideon D‚ÄôArcangelo (2003). Alan Lomax foresaw that computers would be an ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to people of all ages and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an interactive multi-media computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world's song and dance cultures, incidentally helping people understand their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance.Some have likened The Global Jukebox to Pandora, see for example the / interview of Don Fleming by reporter John Hockenberry on the Public Radio International program , The Takeaway. Since Alan Lomax's death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.

Details He was approximately 21 years old, and a private in the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot (later The Essex Regiment), British Army during the Second China War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 21 August 1860 at the Taku Forts, China, Private McDougall with an officer of his regiment (Robert Montresor Rogers) and a lieutenant of the 67th Regiment (Edmund Henry Lenon) displayed great gallantry in swimming the ditches and entering the North Taku Fort by an embrasure during the assault. They were the first of the British established on the walls of the Fort. Until 1990 he laid in an unmarked grave. A campaign at that time added a stone to all unmarked VC winners. He is buried in Old Calton Cemetery. The grave lies to the north-east, not far from the main entrance. The medal The VC was stolen from the family home in 1960 and never recovered.

Instead of sustaining a chain reaction, a subcritical reactor uses additional neutrons from an outside source. There are two general classes of such devices. One uses neutrons provided by a nuclear fusion machine, a concept known as a fusion‚Äìfission hybrid. The other uses neutrons created through spallation of heavy nuclei by charged particles such as protons accelerated by a particle accelerator, a concept known as an accelerator-driven system (ADS) or accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor.  Motivation  A subcritical reactor can be used to destroy heavy isotopes contained in the used fuel from a conventional nuclear reactor, while at the same time producing electricity. The long-lived transuranic elements in nuclear waste can in principle be fissioned, releasing energy in the process and leaving behind the fission products which are shorter-lived. This would shorten considerably the time for disposal of radioactive waste. However, some isotopes have threshold fission cross sections and therefore require a fast reactor for being fissioned. Also, they release on average too few new neutrons per fission, so that with a fuel containing a high fraction of them, criticality cannot be reached. The accelerator driven reactor is independent of this parameter and thus can utilize these nuclides. The three most important long-term radioactive isotopes that could advantageously be handled that way are neptunium-237, americium-241 and americium-243. The nuclear weapon material plutonium-239 is also suitable although it can be expended in a cheaper way as MOX fuel or inside existing fast reactors. Besides nuclear waste incineration, there is interest in this type reactor because it is perceived as inherently safe, unlike a conventional reactor. In most types of critical reactors, there exist circumstances in which the rate of fission can increase rapidly, damaging or destroying the reactor and allowing the escape of radioactive material (see SL-1 or Chernobyl disaster). With a subcritical reactor, the reaction will cease unless continually fed neutrons from an outside source. However, the problem of heat generation even after ending the chain reaction remains, so that continuous cooling of such a reactor for a considerable period after shut-down remains vital in order to avoid overheating.  Principle  Most current ADS designs propose a high-intensity proton accelerator with an energy of about 1 GeV, directed towards a spallation target or spallation neutron source. The source located in the heart of the reactor core contains liquid metal which is impacted by the beam, thus releasing neutrons and is cooled by circulating the liquid metal such as lead-bismuth towards a heat exchanger. The nuclear reactor core surrounding the spallation neutron source contains the fuel rods, the fuel being preferably Thorium. Thereby, for each proton intersecting the spallation target, an average of 20 neutrons is released which fission the surrounding fissile part of the fuel and enrich the fertile part. The neutron balance can be regulated or indeed shut off by adjusting the accelerator power so that the reactor would be below criticality. The additional neutrons provided by the spallation neutron source provide the degree of control as do the delayed neutrons in a conventional nuclear reactor, the difference being that spallation neutron source-driven neutrons are easily controlled by the accelerator. The main advantage is inherent safety. A conventional nuclear reactor's nuclear fuel possesses self-regulating properties such as the Doppler effect or void effect, which make these nuclear reactors safe. In addition to these physical properties of conventional reactors, in the subcritical reactor, whenever the neutron source is turned off, the fission reaction ceases and only the decay heat remains. The principle of operation of an accelerator-driven reactor  Technical challenges  There are technical difficulties to overcome before ADS can become economical and eventually be integrated into future nuclear waste management. The accelerator must provide a high intensity and also be highly reliable. There are concerns about the window separating the protons from the spallation target, which is expected to be exposed to stress under extreme conditions. However, recent experience with the MEGAPIE liquid metal neutron spallation source tested at the Paul Scherrer Institute has demonstrated a working beam window under a 0.78 MW intense proton beam. The chemical separation of the transuranic elements and the fuel manufacturing, as well as the structure materials, are important issues. Finally, the lack of nuclear data at high neutron energies limits the efficiency of the design. Some laboratory experiments and many theoretical studies have demonstrated the theoretical possibility of such a plant. Carlo Rubbia, a nuclear physicist, Nobel laureate, and former director of CERN, was one of the first to conceive a design of a subcritical reactor, the so-called \\"energy amplifier\\". In 2005, several large-scale projects are going on in Europe and Japan to further develop subcritical reactor technology. In 2012 CERN scientists and engineers launched the International Thorium Energy Committee (iThEC), an organization dedicated to pursuing this goal and which organized the ThEC13 conference on the subject.  Economics and public acceptance  Subcritical reactors have been proposed both as a means of generating electric power and as a means of transmutation of nuclear waste, so the gain is twofold. However, the costs for construction, safety and maintenance of such complex installations are expected to be very high, let alone the amount of research needed to develop a practical design (see above). There exist cheaper and reasonably safe waste management concepts, such as the transmutation in fast-neutron reactors. However, the solution of a subcritical reactor might be favoured for a better public acceptance - it is considered more acceptable to burn the waste than to bury it for hundreds of thousands of years. For future waste management, a few transmutation devices could be integrated into a large-scale nuclear program, hopefully increasing only slightly the overall costs. The main challenge facing partitioning and transmutation operations is the need to enter nuclear cycles of extremely long duration: about 200 years. . Another disadvantage is the generation of high quantities of intermediate-level long-lived radioactive waste (ILW) which will also require deep geological disposal to be safely managed. A more positive aspect is the expected reduction in size of the repository, which was estimated to be an order of 4 to 6. Both positive and negative aspects were examined in an international benchmark studyhttp://juser.fz- juelich.de/record/1315/files/Energie%26Umwelt_15.pdf coordinated by Forschungszentrum J√ºlich and financed by the European Union. Subcritical hybrid systems While ADS was originally conceptualized as a part of a light water reactor design, other proposals have been made that incorporate an ADS into other generation IV reactor concepts. One such proposal calls for a gas- cooled fast reactor that is fueled primarily by plutonium and americium. The neutronic properties of americium make it difficult to use in any critical reactor, because it tends to make the moderator temperature coefficient more positive, decreasing stability. The inherent safety of an ADS, however, would allow americium to be safely burned. These materials also have good neutron economy, allowing the pitch-to-diameter ratio to be large, which allows for improved natural circulation and economics.  Muon-driven systems for nuclear waste disposal  Subcritical methods for use in nuclear waste disposal that do not rely on neutron sources are also being developed. These include systems that rely on the mechanism of muon capture, in which muons (Œº‚àí) produced by a compact accelerator-driven source transmute long-lived radioactive isotopes to stable isotopes.

The Mississippi Republican Party is the state affiliate of the United States Republican Party. The party chairman is Frank Bordeaux, and the Party is based in Jackson, Mississippi. The original Republican Party of Mississippi was founded following the American Civil War, the current incarnation of the Mississippi Republican Party was founded in 1956. The party would grow in popularity during the 1960s with wedge issues such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and today the party has the majority in the state. History Platform adopted by the Republican party of Mississippi, in convention assembled, in the City of Jackson, September 10-11, 1867 In 1956, Wirt Adams Yerger, Jr., an insurance agent from Jackson, founded the modern Mississippi Republican Party and served as the first state chairman from 1956 until 1966. He was chairman of the Mississippi delegation to the Republican National Convention in 1956, 1960, and 1964. He was elected to a four-year term as chairman of the Southern Association of Republican State Chairman in 1960. In 2009, the central committee of the Mississippi Republican Party named Yerger Chairman Emeritus. The Mississippi Republican Party would grow in supporters with then President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who still twice lost the electoral votes of Mississippi. On September 24, 1960, Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon campaigned in the state, the first time a presidential candidate had appeared in the state in more than a century.Nash, Jere and Taggert, Andy. Mississippi Politics: The Struggle for Power, 1976-2006. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2006. pp. 41-42 During the 1964 Republican National Convention Mississippi delegates would help nominate Barry Goldwater for President. Goldwater would go on to win 87 percent of the vote in Mississippi in the 1964 presidential election, the first time a Republican would win the state since the Reconstruction Era.Nash and Taggert pp. 45-46 Only once since 1956 has a non-Republican presidential candidate won the state of Mississippi, Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election.Nash and Taggert pp. 55 In 1988, Republican Congressman Trent Lott would defeat Democratic Congressman Wayne Dowdy to replace retiring Senator John Stennis (D-MS). Gubernatorial elections In 1963, Rubel Phillips became the first Republican nominee for governor in 80 years, challenging then-Lt. Gov. Paul Johnson, Jr. and garnering 38 percent of the vote. Phillips ran again in 1967 against John Bell Williams but lost again, this time earning 29 percent of the vote. In 1991, for the first time in over a century a Republican would become the Governor of Mississippi, when Kirk Fordice would earn 50.8 percent of the popular vote, defeating Democrat Ray Mabus.Nash and Taggert pp. 230 In the 2003 Mississippi Gubernatorial Election, Haley Barbour defeated then incumbent Democrat Ronnie Musgrove with 52.59% of the vote.http://www.sos.state.ms.us/elections/2003GeneralReCap/Certified/01Governor.pdf On November 5, 2019, Tate Reeves was elected Governor of Mississippi and assumed office in January 2020. Policy positions While Mississippi Republicans take positions on a wide variety of issues, some of the noteworthy ones include: * Abortion - \\"Protecting and securing the 'life, liberty, and property' of Mississippians begins first with guarding the life of the unborn child. Our policies should honor the sanctity of innocent human life.\\" In November 2011, Governor Haley Barbour voted for Mississippi Initiative 26.http://www.sunherald.com/2011/11/03/3552207/barbour-votes-for-personhood- prop.html Initiative #26 would amend the Mississippi Constitution to define the word \\"person\\" or \\"persons\\", as those terms are used in Article III of the state constitution, to include every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the functional equivalent thereof. * Education - \\"Our instructors must have the freedom to teach, our students must have the opportunity to learn, and our policies should focus on the classroom ‚Äì not the boardroom.\\" http://msgop.org/ * Energy policy - The Republican Party believes there needs to be a balance in the use of both renewable and non-renewable energy resources. * Voting rights - In January 2009, Republican Senator Joey Fillingane put forward Mississippi Initiative 27 which would amend the Mississippi Constitution to require voters to submit a government issued photo identification before being allowed to vote. This initiative passed on November 8, 2011 * Private property - Republican Party members supported Mississippi Initiative 31 on the topic of eminent domain. Initiative #31 would amend the Mississippi Constitution to prohibit state and local government from taking private property by eminent domain and then conveying it to other persons or private businesses for a period of 10 years after acquisition. * Taxes - The Republican Party believes in cutting taxes. Current Republican officeholders The Mississippi Republican Party hold all the eight statewide offices and holds a majority in the Mississippi Senate. Republicans also hold both of the state's U.S. Senate seats and 3 of the state's 4 U.S. House seats.

Translations of the Swadesh list into a set of languages allow researchers to quantify the interrelatedness of those languages. The Swadesh list is named after linguist Morris Swadesh.

In 1952 he published a list of 215 meanings,Swadesh 1952: 456‚Äì7 PDF of which he suggested the removal of 16 for being unclear or not universal, with one added to arrive at 200 words. In 1955Swadesh 1955: 125 he wrote, \\"The only solution appears to be a drastic weeding out of the list, in the realization that quality is at least as important as quantity....Even the new list has defects, but they are relatively mild and few in number.\\" After minor corrections the final 100-word list was published posthumously in 1971Swadesh 1971: 283 and 1972.

Principle  In origin, the words in the Swadesh lists were chosen for their universal, culturally independent availability in as many languages as possible, regardless of their \\"stability\\". Nevertheless, the stability of the resulting list of \\"universal\\" vocabulary under language change and the potential use of this fact for purposes of glottochronology have been analyzed by numerous authors, including Marisa Lohr 1999, 2000.Marisa Lohr (2000), \\"New Approaches to Lexicostatistics and Glottochronology\\" in C. Renfrew, A. McMahon and L. Trask, ed. Time Depth in Historical Linguistics, Vol. 1, pp. 209‚Äì223 The Swadesh list was put together by Morris Swadesh on the basis of his intuitions. More recent similar lists, such as the Dolgopolsky list (1964) or the Leipzig‚ÄìJakarta list (2009), are based on systematic data from many different languages, but they are not yet as widely known nor as widely used as the Swadesh list.  Usage in lexicostatistics and glottochronology  Lexicostatistical test lists are used in lexicostatistics to define subgroupings of languages, and in glottochronology to \\"provide dates for branching points in the tree\\".Sheila Embleton (1992), in W. Bright, ed., International Encyclopaedia of Linguistics, Oxford University Press, p. 131 The task of defining (and counting the number) of cognate words in the list is far from trivial, and often is subject to dispute, because cognates do not necessarily look similar, and recognition of cognates presupposes knowledge of the sound laws of the respective languages. For example, English \\"wheel\\" and Sanskrit chakra are cognates, although they are not recognizable as such without knowledge of the history of both languages. Swadesh 100 Original Final List Swadesh's final list, published in 1971, contains 100 terms. Explanations of the terms can be found in Swadesh 1952 or, where noted by a dagger (‚Ä†), in Swadesh 1955. \\"Claw\\" was only added in 1955, but again replaced by many well-known specialists with (finger)nail, because expressions for \\"claw\\" are not available in many old, extinct, or lesser known languages. Swadesh 207 list The most used list nowadays is the Swadesh 207-word list, conform Swadesh 1952. In Wiktionary (\\"Swadesh lists by language\\"), PanlexJonathan Pool (2016), Panlex Swadesh Lists PDFDavid Kamholz, Jonathan Pool, Susan Colowick (2014), PanLex: Building a Resource for Panlingual Lexical Translation PDF and in Palisto's \\"Swadesh Word List of Indo-European languages\\"Palisto (2013), Swadesh Word List of Indo-European languages . hundreds of Swadesh lists in this form can be found. Shorter lists The Swadesh‚ÄìYakhontov list is a 35-word subset of the Swadesh list posited as especially stable by Russian linguist Sergei Yakhontov. It has been used in lexicostatistics by linguists such as Sergei Starostin. With their Swadesh numbers, they are:Starostin 1991 Holman et al. (2008) found that in identifying the relationships between Chinese dialects the Swadesh‚ÄìYakhontov list was less accurate than the original Swadesh-100 list. Further they found that a different (40-word) list was just as accurate as the Swadesh-100 list. However, they calculated the relative stability of the words by comparing retentions between languages in established language families. They found no statistically significant difference in the correlations in the families of the Old versus the New World. The ranked Swadesh-100 list, with Swadesh numbers and relative stability, is as follows (Holman et al., Appendix. Asterisked words appear on the 40-word list): =Sign languages= In studying the sign languages of Vietnam and Thailand, linguist James Woodward noted that the traditional Swadesh list applied to spoken languages was unsuited for sign languages. The Swadesh list results in overestimation of the relationships between sign languages, due to indexical signs such as pronouns and parts of the body.

This is done both for diagnostic and interventional purposes. A common example of cardiac catheterization is coronary catheterization that involves catheterization of the coronary arteries for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctions (\\"heart attacks\\"). Catheterization is most often performed in special laboratories with fluoroscopy and highly maneuverable tables. These \\"cath labs\\" are often equipped with cabinets of catheters, stents, balloons, etc. of various sizes to increase efficiency. Monitors show the fluoroscopy imaging, EKG, pressure waves, and more. Uses A person undergoing a procedure where an 8 F introducer was placed in the right jugular vein using a 5F MAK access kit. A 7 F balloon tipped catheter was introduced via the venous sheath, the balloon was inflated and the catheter was advanced through the right heart chambers into the pulmonary capillary wedge position. Right sided pressures were obtained and cardiac output was measured using thermodilution. Coronary angiography is a diagnostic procedure that allows visualization of the coronary vessels. Fluoroscopy is used to visualize the lumens of the arteries as a 2-D projection. Should these arteries show narrowing or blockage, then techniques exist to open these arteries. Percutaneous coronary intervention is a blanket term that involves the use of mechanical stents, balloons, etc. to increase blood flow to previously blocked (or occluded) vessels. Measuring pressures in the heart is also an important aspect of catheterization. The catheters are fluid filled conduits that can transmit pressures to outside the body to pressure transducers. This allows measuring pressure in any part of the heart that a catheter can be maneuvered into. Measuring blood flow is also possible through several methods. Most commonly, flows are estimated using the Fick principle and thermodilution. These methods have drawbacks, but give invasive estimations of the cardiac output, which can be used to make clinical decisions (e.g., cardiogenic shock, heart failure) to improve the person's condition. Cardiac catheterization can be used as part of a therapeutic regimen to improve outcomes for survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Cardiac catheterization often requires the use of fluoroscopy to visualize the path of the catheter as it enters the heart or as it enters the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries are known as \\"epicardial vessels\\" as they are located in the epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart.Malouf JF, Edwards WD, Tajik A, Seward JB. Chapter 4. Functional Anatomy of the Heart. In: Fuster V, Walsh RA, Harrington RA. eds. Hurst's The Heart, 13e. New York, NY: McGraw- Hill; 2011. http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=376&Sectionid;=40279729 . Accessed May 09, 2015. The use of fluoroscopy requires radiopaque contrast, which in rare cases can lead to contrast-induced kidney injury (see Contrast- induced nephropathy). People are constantly exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation during procedures. Ideal table positioning between the x-ray source and receiver, and radiation monitoring via thermoluminescent dosimetry, are two main ways of reducing a person's exposure to radiation. People with certain comorbidities (people who have more than one condition at the same time) have a higher risk of adverse events during the cardiac catheterization procedure. These comorbidity conditions include aortic aneurysm, aortic stenosis, extensive three-vessel coronary artery disease, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and unstable angina. =Left heart catheterization= 250px Left heart catheterization (LHC) is an ambiguous term and sometime clarification is required: * LHC can mean measuring the pressures of the left side of the heart. * LHC can be synonymous with coronary angiography. technique is also used to assess the amount of occlusion (or blockage) in a coronary artery, often described as a percentage of occlusion. A thin, flexible wire is inserted into either the femoral artery or the radial artery and threaded toward the heart until it is in the ascending aorta. Radial access is not associated with an increased risk of stroke over femoral access. At this point, a catheter is guided over the wire into the ascending aorta, where it can be maneuvered into the coronary arteries through the coronary ostia. In this position, the interventional cardiologist can inject contrast and visualize the flow through the vessel. If necessary, the physician can utilize percutaneous coronary intervention techniques, including the use of a stent (either bare-metal or drug-eluting) to open the blocked vessel and restore appropriate blood flow. In general, occlusions greater than 70% of the width of the vessel lumen are thought to require intervention. However, in cases where multiple vessels are blocked (so-called \\"three-vessel disease\\"), the interventional cardiologist may opt instead to refer the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; see Coronary artery bypass surgery) surgery. =Right heart catheterization= Right heart cath using a Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter Right heart catheterization (RHC) allows the physician to determine the pressures within the heart (intracardiac pressures). The heart is most often accessed via the internal jugular or femoral vein; arteries are not used. Values are commonly obtained for the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary \\"wedge\\" pressures. Right heart catheterizations also allow the physician to estimate the cardiac output, the amount of blood that flows from the heart each minute, and the cardiac index, a hemodynamic parameter that relates the cardiac output to a patient's body size. Determination of cardiac output can be done by releasing a small amount of saline solution (either chilled or at room temperature) in one area of the heart and measuring the change in blood temperature over time in another area of the heart. Right heart catheterization is often done for pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The pulmonary artery catheter can be placed, used, and removed, or it can be placed and left in place for continuous monitoring. The latter can be done an intensive care unit (ICU) to permit frequent measurement of the hemodynamic parameters in response to interventions. Parameters obtainable from a right heart catheterization: * Right atrial pressure * Right ventricular pressure * Pulmonary artery pressure * Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure * Systemic vascular resistance * Pulmonary vascular resistance * Cardiac output * Blood oxygenation Implantation of a CardioMEMS is done during a right heart catheterization. This device is implanted into the pulmonary artery to permit real-time measurement of the pulmonary artery pressure over time. =Coronary catheterization= Coronary catheterization is an invasive process and comes with risks that include stroke, heart attack, and death. Like any procedure, the benefits should outweigh the risks and so this procedure is reserved for those with symptoms of serious heart diseases and is never used for screening purposes. Other, non-invasive tests are better used when the diagnosis or certainty of the diagnosis is not as clear. Indications for cardiac catheterization include the following: * Acute coronary syndromes: ST elevation MI (STEMI), non-ST Elevation MI (NSTEMI), and unstable angina * Evaluation of coronary artery disease as indicated by ** Abnormal stress test ** As part of the pre-op evaluation for other cardiac procedures (e.g., valve replacement) as coronary artery bypass grafting may be done at the same timek ** Risk stratification for high cardiac risk surgeries (e.g., endovascular aneurysm repair) * Persistent chest pain despite medical therapy thought to be cardiac in origin * New-onset unexplained heart failure * Survival of sudden cardiac death or dangerous cardiac arrhythmias * Workup of suspected Prinzmetal angina (coronary vasospasm) Right heart catheterization, along with pulmonary function testing and other testing should be done to confirm pulmonary hypertension prior to having vasoactive pharmacologic treatments approved and initiated. * to measure intracardiac and intravascular blood pressures * to take tissue samples for biopsy * to inject various agents for measuring blood flow in the heart; also to detect and quantify the presence of an intracardiac shunt * to inject contrast agents in order to study the shape of the heart vessels and chambers and how they change as the heart beats =Pacemakers and defibrillators= Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs of a pacemaker with normally located leads in the right atrium (white arrow) and right ventricle (black arrowhead), respectively. Placement of internal pacemakers and defibrillators are done through catheterization as well. An exception to this is placement of electrodes on the outer surface of the heart (called epicardial electrodes). Otherwise, electrodes are place through the venous system into the heart and left there permanently. Typically, these devices are placed in the left upper chest and enter the left subclavian vein and electrodes are placed in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus (for the left ventricle stimulation). =Valve assessment= Echocardiography is a non-invasive method to evaluate the heart valves. However, sometimes the valve pressure gradients need to be measured directly because echo is equivocal for the severity of valve disease. Invasive assessment of the valve can be done with catheterization by placing a catheter across the valve and measuring the pressures simultaneously on each side of the valve to obtain the pressure gradient.Grossman & Baim's cardiac catheterization, angiography, and intervention. Moscucci, Mauro, (Eighth edition). Philadelphia. p. 272. . OCLC 829739969. In conjunction with a right heart catheterization, the valve area can be estimated. For example, in aortic valve area calculation the Gorlin equation can be used to calculate the area if the cardiac output, pressure gradient, systolic period, and heart rate are known. =Pulmonary angiography= Evaluation of the blood flow to the lungs can be done invasively through catheterization. Contrast is injected into the pulmonary trunk, left or right pulmonary artery, or segment of the pulmonary artery. =Shunt evaluation= Atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt Cardiac shunts can be evaluated through catheterization. Using oxygen as a marker, the oxygen saturation of blood can be sampled at various locations in and around the heart. For example, a left-to-right atrial septal defect will show a marked increase in oxygen saturation in the right atrium, ventricle, and pulmonary artery as compared to the mixed venous oxygen saturation from the oxygenated blood from the lungs mixing into the venous return to the heart. Utilizing the Fick principle, the ratio of blood flow in the lungs (Qp) and system circulations (Qs) can calculate the Qp:Qs ratio. Elevation of the Qp:Qs ratio above 1.5 to 2.0 suggests that there is a hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunt (such that the blood flow through the lungs is 1.5 to 2.0 times more than the systemic circulation). This ratio can be evaluated non-invasively with echocardiography too, however. A \\"shunt run\\" is often done when evaluating for a shunt by taking blood samples from superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC), right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and system arterial. Abrupt increases in oxygen saturation support a left-to-right shunt and lower than normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation supports a right-to-left shunt. Samples from the SVC & IVC are used to calculate mixed venous oxygen saturation. =Ventriculography= thumb By injecting contrast into the left ventricle, the outline of the ventricle can be measured in both systole and diastole to estimate the ejection fraction (a marker of heart function). Due to the high contrast volumes and injection pressures, this is often not performed unless other, non-invasive methods are not acceptable, not possible, or conflicting. =Percutaneous aortic valve replacement= Advancements in cardiac catheterization has permitted replacement of heart valves by means of blood vessels. This method allows valve replacement without open heart surgery and can be performed on people who are high-risk for such a surgery. =Balloon septostomy= Catheterization can also be used to perform balloon septostomy, which is the widening of a foramen ovale, patent foramen ovale (PFO), or atrial septal defect (ASD) using a balloon catheter. This can be done in certain congenital heart diseases in which the mechanical shunting is required to sustain life such as in transposition of the great vessels. =Alcohol septal ablation= Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the myocardium is thickened and can cause blood flow obstruction. If hemodynamically significant, this excess muscle can be removed to improve blood flow. Surgically, this can be done with septal myectomy. However, it can be done through catheterization and by injecting ethanol to destroy the tissue in an alcohol septal ablation. This is done by selected an appropriate septal artery supplying the intended area and, essentially, causing a localized, controlled myocardial infarction of the area with ethanol. Complications Complications of cardiac catheterization and tools used during catheterization include, but not limited to: * Death * Stroke * Heart attack * Ventricular ectopy and ventricular arrhythmias * Pericardial effusion * Bleeding: internal and external * Infection * Radiation burn * Contrast induced nephropathy from contrast use The likelihood of these risks depends on many factors that include the procedure being performed, the overall health state of the patient, situational (elective vs emergent), medications (e.g., anticoagulation), and more. Procedure \\"Cardiac catheterization\\" is a general term for a group of procedures. Access to the heart is obtained through a peripheral artery or vein. Commonly, this includes the radial artery, internal jugular vein, and femoral artery/vein. Each blood vessel has its advantages and disadvantages. Once access is obtained, plastic catheters (tiny hollow tubes) and flexible wires are used to navigate to and around the heart. Catheters come in numerous shapes, lengths, diameters, number of lumens, and other special features such as electrodes and balloons. Once in place, they are used to measure or intervene. Imaging is an important aspect to catheterization and commonly includes fluoroscopy but can also include forms of echocardiography (TTE, TEE, ICE) and ultrasound (IVUS). Obtaining access uses the Seldinger technique by puncturing the vessel with a needle, placing a wire through the needle into the lumen of the vessel, and then exchanging the needle for a larger plastic sheath. Finding the vessel with a needle can be challenging and both ultrasound and fluoroscopy can be used to aid in finding and confirming access. Sheaths typically have a side port that can be used to withdraw blood or injection fluids/medications, and they also have an end hole that permits introducing the catheters, wires, etc. coaxially into the blood vessel. Once access is obtained, what is introduced into the vessel depends on the procedure being performed. Some catheters are formed to a particular shape and can really only be manipulated by inserting/withdrawing the catheter in the sheath and rotating the catheter. Others may include internal structures that permit internal manipulation (e.g., intracardiac echocardiography). Finally, when the procedure is completed, the catheters are removed and the sheath is removed. With time, the hole made in the blood vessel will heal. Vascular closure devices can be used to speed along hemostasis. =Equipment= Much equipment is required for a facility to perform the numerous possible procedures for cardiac catheterization. General: * Catheters * Electrocardiography monitors * External defibrillator * Fluoroscopy * Pressure transducers * Sheaths Percutaneous coronary intervention: * Coronary stents: bare-metal stent (BMS) and drug-eluting stent (DES) * Angioplasty balloons * Atherectomy lasers and rotational devices * Left atrial appendage occlusion devices Electrophysiology: * Ablation catheters: radiofrequency (RF) and cryo * Pacemakers * Defibrillators History The history of cardiac catheterization dates back to Stephen Hales (1677-1761) and Claude Bernard (1813-1878), who both used it on animal models. Clinical application of cardiac catheterization begins with Dr. Werner Forssmann in 1929, who inserted a catheter into the vein of his own forearm, guided it fluoroscopically into his right atrium, and took an X-ray picture of it. However, even after this achievement, hospital administrators removed Forssmann from his position owing to his unorthodox methods. During World War II, Andr√© Fr√©d√©ric Cournand, a physician at NewYork- Presbyterian/Columbia, then Columbia-Bellevue, opened the first catheterization lab. In 1956, Forssmann and Cournand were co-recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the development of cardiac catheterization. Dr. Eugene A. Stead performed research in the 1940s, which paved the way for cardiac catheterization in the USA.

It is situated approximately west of Edinburgh and east of Glasgow on the old A8 road.  History  Blackburn means \\"the black stream\\", from the Old English bl√¶c \\"black\\" and burna \\"stream\\". The name was recorded as Blachebrine in 1152. As a small industrial centre, Blackburn originally developed as a cotton- manufacturing town. In the mid-19th century, it became a centre for coal mining. Its small population expanded rapidly from 4,302 in 1961 to around 9,000 by 1965 as a result of employment opportunities in Bathgate to the north and through in-migration following the inception of the Glasgow Overspill Plan. The closure of the British Leyland plant in 1986 brought decline to the area, along with the destruction of many homes built during the 1960s. The railway station at Bathgate attracts commuters to live in Blackburn and provides easy access to both Glasgow and Edinburgh. Blackburn House Blackburn House is a category A-listed Georgian building, situated to the east of the town. Churches Blackburn and Seafield Parish Church (Church of Scotland) is located in Blackburn. The congregation celebrated its centenary in 2008. Blackburn Gospel Hall (Christian Brethren) meets for worship services and Bible studies in a well-kept church building originally constructed as Blackburn's village school in the late 18th century. Our Lady of Lourdes, a Roman Catholic church located in Blackburn, also serves neighbouring communities and partners with a branch of the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Educational facilities  The village has the Roman Catholic secondary St. Kentigern's Academy, which serves students from the surrounding areas of West Lothian. Blackburn is also in the catchment area of the non-denominational secondary Bathgate Academy, which is away. The village also houses three primary schools: Murrayfield Primary, Our Lady of Lourdes Primary and Blackburn Primary as well as Pinewood School, a combination primary/secondary additional needs school. Formerly the village had its own Blackburn Academy, a non-denominational secondary school that also served students from the surrounding areas of West Lothian. However, the Academy was closed in 1992 after several new non-denominational high schools had opened in nearby Livingston. Climate Sport =Football= Blackburn is home to Scottish football club Blackburn United who play at the Purdie Worldwide Community Stadium (New Murrayfield Park) near the centre of the town and compete in the East of Scotland Football League Premier Division. The Club forms the pinnacle of the Blackburn United Community Sports Club. =Taekwondo= Blackburn is a big part of Scotia TaeKwonDo, with national competitions regularly held in the Blackburn Community Centre which is adjacent to New Murrayfield Park.

On 20 October 1897, Findlater, then a junior piper in the Gordon Highlanders, was shot in the ankles during an advance against opposing defences at the Battle of the Dargai Heights; unable to walk, and exposed to enemy fire, he continued playing, to encourage the battalion's advance. The event was widely covered in the press, making Findlater a public hero. After receiving the Victoria Cross, Findlater supplemented his Army pension by performing at music halls, much to the outrage of the military establishment, but after growing scandal he retired to take up farming in Banffshire in 1899. In 1914, he re-enlisted in the Gordon Highlanders for the First World War; he served as the senior piper for the 9th Battalion until the end of 1915, when he returned home because of ill health. Active in a local pipe band, he continued to farm until his death in 1942, aged 70. Early life Findlater was born in 1872 at Turriff, Aberdeenshire, one of eleven children of Alexander Findlater, a miller, and his wife, Mary Ann Clark. He attended the school in Turriff but left at a young age to work as a farm labourer;Spiers (2008) under the law then in force, children were permitted to leave school at thirteen.Key dates in British Education (1000‚Äì1899) ThePotteries.org Two months after his sixteenth birthday, on 7 April 1888, he travelled to Aberdeen and enlisted in the 2nd Battalion, Gordon Highlanders. The battalion was posted to Ceylon, where in 1891 he transferred to the 1st Battalion, then serving on the North-West Frontier of British India, now part of Pakistan. He first saw active combat there in March 1895, at the Malakand Pass, where he was hit but not wounded; later in the year, he served with the relief force in the Chitral Expedition. In December 1896 he was appointed as a piper in the battalion's band. The Gordons, in common with other Highland regiments of the time, maintained a pipe band in each battalion for both ceremonial and military purposes; the pipers were trained infantrymen, and accompanied the main force on operations. The following year, the 1st Battalion was assigned as part of the force for the Tirah campaign, an expedition into the mountains to secure the Khyber pass and the northern approaches to India. Dargai Heights An artist's illustration of Findlater's winning of the Victoria Cross On 20 October 1897, an attempt by a British force to take the strongly held Dargai Heights was beaten back, leaving three battalions pinned down under heavy fire from above and unable to withdraw. They were reinforced by the 1st Gordons, who were ordered to advance through the open ground and storm the heights, led by their five pipers. Findlater was wounded before reaching the hillside, with a superficial wound to his left foot and a broken right ankle. Unable to walk, he pulled himself to a boulder, propped himself up, and continued to play to encourage the advance. The infantry following behind successfully reached the hillside, climbed the heights, and dispersed the defenders. All observers agreed on the basics of the story, but the exact details of what happened were somewhat confused. The initial press reports describing the \\"wounded piper\\" took him to be Patrick Milne, the senior piper, and playing Cock o' the North, the regimental march. It was quickly discovered that Milne had been unable to play ‚Äì he had been wounded in the chest ‚Äì and that Findlater had been the man involved, playing The Haughs O' Cromdale. This was perhaps a more appropriate tune; not only was it a quicker and livelier strathspey, but the content fitted the situation. The Battle of Cromdale had famously ‚Äì perhaps apocryphally ‚Äì seen a wounded Jacobite piper perch on a rock and play his comrades into battle,Bagpipes in War, Greg Allen. and the traditional ballad itself described how \\"the Gordons boldly did advance ... upon the Haughs o' Cromdale\\".Text of The Haughs O' Cromdale Findlater was evacuated to Rawalpindi where he was treated, and unable to continue in the Army as a result of his injuries, he was sent to Netley Hospital to convalesce. It was announced in May 1898 that he would receive the Victoria Cross, one of four men to be so honoured for actions at Dargai, and was personally decorated by Queen Victoria at Netley on 14 May, a few days before he was formally discharged from the Army. Public celebrity The Gordons' charge at Dargai had caught the imagination of the British public, and the romantic description of the wounded piper encouraging his comrades on was perhaps the most famous element of it. Whilst recovering, Findlater received a large number of public donations, including sets of bagpipes, and by at least one account, a proposal of marriage.Spiers (2006), p. 126. The public interest increased sharply after he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and to supplement his Army pension Findlater arranged to appear at the Military Tournament, where he drew large crowds; for just thirty performances, he was paid two-thirds as much as his annual Army pension of ¬£46. He then began to perform at music halls, first at the London Alhambra and then nationally, with his earnings climbing as high as ¬£100 a week. Whilst popular with the crowds, Findlater was seen by many of the military establishment as deliberately profiting from the Victoria Cross. The War Office approached the management of the Alhambra to try and stop his performance, without success, sparking counter-criticism as to whether the Army had any standing to control the private engagements of a man who had already left the Army. Within the year, however, his fame began to turn sour; he was implicated in a contentious breach of promise lawsuit in late 1898, which led to heckling at his Scottish performances, and to avoid further scandal left the country to tour the United States and Canada. Later life Following his return from North America, Findlater married his cousin Helen at Turriff in August 1899. A year later, he took up the tenancy of a farm at Forglen, where he and Helen settled to begin a family; they would have five children, two sons and three daughters. At the start of the First World War, Findlater re-enlisted in the Army, returning to his old regiment. He was posted to the 9th Battalion of the Gordons, a New Army battalion in 15th (Scottish) Division, where he was appointed as the sergeant piper (or pipe major), the battalion's senior piper. He served with the regiment through its first year in France, including the Battle of Loos, before being invalided home in December 1915.Spiers (2008); He continued to farm at Forglen, and was a member of the local pipe band at Turriff; from 1927 to 1940 he served as its pipe major. He died in early 1942, shortly after his seventieth birthday, of a heart attack. Legacy The medals awarded to Findlater on display at the Gordon Highlanders Museum, 2017Whilst his moment of personal celebrity was fleeting, Findlater remained a popular figure in the public memory, continuing to be a subject of artwork and stories for some years. He was the focal point of Edward Hale's painting Piper Findlater winning the VC (1897), Stanley Berkeley's Charge of the Gordon Highlanders (1897), Vereker Hamilton's Piper Findlater at Dargai (1898), Richard Caton Woodville's The Storming of Dargai Heights (1898) and Robert Gibb's Dargai (1909). Findlater's playing at Dargai, along with the charge itself, became one of the more well-remembered moments of the Gordons' regimental history; they later applied for the Dargai Heights to be recognised as a battle honour, the only one of the nine participating regiments to do so, but were declined.Baker (1986), p. 280. One of the \\"Dand MacNeil\\" stories in George MacDonald Fraser's The General Danced at Dawn concerns an animated discussion in the Sergeants Mess concerning exactly what tune Piper Findlater did play at the Dargai Heights, Findlater himself not being positive what it had been.

A typical concrete mixer uses a revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller volume works, portable concrete mixers are often used so that the concrete can be made at the construction site, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. An alternative to a machine is mixing concrete by hand. This is usually done in a wheelbarrow; however, several companies have recently begun to sell modified tarps for this purpose. The concrete mixer was invented by Columbus, Ohio industrialist Gebhardt Jaeger. History One of the first concrete mixers ever was developed in 1900 by T.L. Smith in Milwaukee. The mixer already exhibited the still common basic construction with a tiltable conical drum (as double cone at that time) with blades. 1925, at least two mixers, built 25 years ago, were still in use (serial numbers 37 and 82). The Smith Mascot in essence has the same construction of the small mixers used today. In the 1920s, the T.L. Smith Company in Milwaukee built the world's largest concrete mixers. Mixers of this company were used e. g. for the construction of the Wilson Dam (six 2-yard and two 4-yard mixers, at the time the largest single installation of the largest concrete mixers in the world), the first stadium of the Ohio State University and the Exchequer Dam. Industrial mixers Today's market increasingly requires consistent homogeneity and short mixing times for the industrial production of ready-mix concrete, and more so for precast/prestressed concrete. This has resulted in refinement of mixing technologies for concrete production. Different styles of stationary mixers have been developed, each with its own inherent strengths targeting different parts of the concrete production market. The most common mixers used today fall into three categories: Twin shaft concrete mixer for concrete plant *Twin-shaft mixers, known for their high intensity mixing, and short mixing times. These mixers are typically used for high strength concrete, RCC and SCC, typically in batches of . *Vertical axis mixers, most commonly used for precast and prestressed concrete. This style of mixer cleans well between batches, and is favoured for coloured concrete, smaller batches (typically ), and multiple discharge points. Within this category, the pan mixers are losing popularity to the more efficient planetary (or counter-current) mixers, as the additional mixing action helps in production of more critical concrete mixes (colour consistency, SCC, etc.). *Drum mixers (reversing drum mixer and tilting drum mixers), used where large volumes (batch sizes of ) are being produced. This type of mixer is capable of high production outputs. All the mixer styles have their own inherent strengths and weaknesses, and all are used throughout the world to varying degrees of popularity. Trucks and trailers =Concrete mixing transport trucks= Operating diagram of a concrete mixer Special concrete transport trucks (in-transit mixers) are made to mix concrete and transport it to the construction site. They can be charged with dry materials and water, with the mixing occurring during transport. They can also be loaded from a \\"central mix\\" plant; with this process the material has already been mixed prior to loading. The concrete mixing transport truck maintains the material's liquid state through agitation, or turning of the drum, until delivery. The interior of the drum on a concrete mixing truck is fitted with a spiral blade. In one rotational direction, the concrete is pushed deeper into the drum. This is the direction the drum is rotated while the concrete is being transported to the building site. This is known as \\"charging\\" the mixer. When the drum rotates in the other direction, the Archimedes' screw-type arrangement \\"discharges\\", or forces the concrete out of the drum. From there it may go onto chutes to guide the viscous concrete directly to the job site. If the truck cannot get close enough to the site to use the chutes, the concrete may be discharged into a concrete pump, connected to a flexible hose, or onto a conveyor belt which can be extended some distance (typically ten or more metres). A pump provides the means to move the material to precise locations, multi-floor buildings, and other distance- prohibitive locations. Buckets suspended from cranes are also used to place the concrete. The drum is traditionally made of steel but on some newer trucks, fibreglass has been used as a weight reduction measure. Terex Advance front discharge truck with three lift axles including one tag axle This Kayaba Rocket concrete mixer delivers concrete in Japan \\"Rear discharge\\" trucks require both a driver and a \\"chuteman\\" to guide the truck and chute back and forth to place concrete in the manner suitable to the contractor. Newer \\"front discharge\\" trucks have controls inside the cab of the truck to allow the driver to move the chute in all directions. The first front discharge mixer, patented in 1974, was designed and built by Royal W. Sims of Holladay, Utah, United States. Concrete mixers are equipped with two or more axles. Four-, five- and six-axle trucks are the most common, with the number being determined by the load and local legislation governing allowable loads on the road. The axles are necessary to distribute the load evenly, allow operation on weight restricted roads, and reduce wear and tear on normal roads. A two- or three-axle truck during the winter when road weight limits are reduced has no usable payload in many jurisdictions. Other areas may require expensive permits to operate. Additional axles other than those used for steering (\\"steers\\") or drivetrain (\\"drives\\") may be installed between the steers and drives, or behind the drives. Mixers commonly have multiple steering axles as well, which generally result in very large turning radii. To facilitate maneuvering, the additional axles may be \\"lift axles\\", which allows them to be raised off the ground so that they do not scrub (get dragged sideways across the ground) on tight turns, or increase the vehicle's turning radius. Axles installed behind the drives are known as \\"tag axles\\" or \\"booster axles\\", and are often equipped to turn opposite to the steering axle to reduce scrubbing and automatically lift when the truck is put into a reverse gear. Tractor trailer combination mixers where the mixer is installed on a trailer instead of a truck chassis are used in some jurisdictions, such as the province of Quebec where even six-axle trucks would have trouble carrying a useful load. Concrete mixers generally do not travel far from their plant, as the concrete begins to set as soon as it is in the truck. Many contractors require that the concrete be in place within 90 minutes after loading. If the truck breaks down or for some other reason the concrete hardens in the truck, workers may need to enter the barrel with jackhammers. Stephen Stepanian filed a patent application for the first truck mixer in 1916.Portland Cement Association: History of Ready Mixed Concrete industry site Trucks weigh , and can carry roughly of concrete although many varying sizes of mixer truck are currently in use. The most common truck capacity is . Most concrete mixers in the UK are limited to a speed of . =Concrete mixer trailers= 1 cubic yard (0.76 m¬≥) cart-away mixing trailer A variant of standard concrete transportation is the concrete or cement mixing trailer. These small versions of transit-mix trucks are used to supply short loads of concrete. They have a concrete mixing drum with a capacity of between . Cart-aways are usually pulled behind a pick-up truck and batched from smaller batching systems. The mixing trailer system is popular with rental yards and building material locations, which use them to supply ready-mix to their regular customer base. =Metered concrete trucks= Metered concrete truck Metered concrete trucks or volumetric mobile mixers contain concrete ingredient materials and water to be mixed on the truck at the job site to make and deliver concrete according to the amount needed. On-site and portable concrete mixers This portable concrete/mortar mixer has wheels and a towing tongue so that it can be towed by a motor vehicle and moved around the worksite by hand, and its rotation is powered by mains electricity. The lever allows the concrete/mortar to be tipped into a wheelbarrow. An outdated model of a small-scale concrete mixer. These older mixers are heavy and can not be moved as easily. They are still self-powered with electric motors. For smaller jobs, such as residential repairs, renovations, or hobbyist-scale projects, many cubic yards of concrete are usually not required. Bagged cement is readily available in small-batch sizes, and aggregate and water are easily obtained in small quantities for the small work site. To service this small-batch concrete market, there many types of small portable concrete mixers are available. A typical portable concrete mixer uses a small revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller jobs the concrete made at the construction site has no time lost in transport, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. Portable concrete mixers may be powered by gasoline engines, although it is more common that they are powered by electric motors using standard mains current. These concrete mixers are further divided based on their loading mechanism. Cement, sand and other aggregates are loaded in a hydraulically operated hopper and then poured into the mixing drum for final mixing. They can be unloaded by tilting the drum. In hand-feed concrete mixers, cement, sand and other aggregates are directly added to the mixing drum manually. Both of these types of concrete mixers are popular in construction activities in Africa, some Middle Eastern countries and in the Indian subcontinent. Self-loading concrete mixers Self-loading concrete mixers are unique machines designed to batch, mix and transport concrete. They consist of a rotating drum mounted on an operator-driven cab-mounted chassis frame fitted with a loading bucket. The operator of the self-loading concrete mixers batches and introduces the ingredients required for mixing concrete (cement, stone aggregates etc.) into the drum using the loading bucket. The drum is usually reversible type, tilt type or a combination of both. A predetermined volume of water is discharged to the drum via a water dispensing unit. The mixture is rotated at mixing speeds within the drum until the concrete discharges via a fitted chute. Self- loading concrete mixers are suited for construction sites where concrete batching plants are unavailable, underfoot conditions are not suited for concrete transit mixer trucks or labor availability is scarce or constrained. Applications include urban and rural construction, concrete pavement maintenance, bridge and tunnel construction, township-level highways construction, foundation construction, national defense facilities, construction of high-speed railways, etc.  Operating code  Operating concrete mixers correctly is one of the biggest safety issues in construction zones. Workers whose tasks are related to concrete processing currently number more than 250,000. Over 10 percent of those workers, 28,000, experienced a job-related injury or illness, and 42 died in just one year.

Knowland was born on 16 August 1922 in Catford, Kent and attended Elmwood Primary School in Croydon. He joined the British Army, the Royal Norfolk Regiment, in 1940 as a private and was commissioned before the end of the next year. At 22 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Norfolks but now attached to No. 1 Commando in Burma, he took part in the Battle of Hill 170 where he was to earn the VC. On 31 January 1945 near Kangaw, Burma, Lieutenant Knowland was in command of a forward platoon of a troop which was being heavily attacked ‚Äì some 300 of the enemy concentrating on his 24 men. During the attacks he moved among the men distributing ammunition and contributing with rifle fire and throwing grenades at the enemy. When the crew of one of his forward Bren light machine guns had been wounded, he rushed forward to man it himself. The enemy was only away but below the level of the trench so to fire into them he stood up. He continued to fire until the casualties had been evacuated. A replacement gun team that had been sent for were injured while moving up and he stayed with the gun until a third team arrived. In a subsequent attack he took over a 2 inch (51 mm) mortar which he fired from the hip directly into the enemy. He returned to the trench for more ammunition and fired the mortar from out in the open. When this was used up he fired his rifle.

It was published by Editorial Seix Barral, S.A., Spain, in 1977. Plot Set in Peru during the 1950s, it is the story of an 18-year-old student who falls for a 32-year-old divorcee. The novel is based on the author's real life experience. Mario, an aspiring writer, works at a radio station, Panamericana, writing news bulletins alongside the disaster-obsessed Pascual. Mario has an aunt (married to a biological uncle) whose sister, Julia, has just been divorced and has come to live with some of his family members. He frequently sees her and though at first they don't get on, they start to go to movies together and gradually become romantically involved. Mario's bosses also run Panamericana's sister station, which broadcasts novelas (short-run soap operas). They're having problems buying the serials on bulk from Cuba, with batches of scripts being ruined and quality being poor, and hence they hire a highly eccentric Bolivian scriptwriter named Pedro Camacho to write the serials. The novel chronicles the scriptwriter's rise and fall in tandem with the protagonist's affair and includes episodes of Pedro's serials, in prose form. These scripts tend to shed light on what the latter is like and has done, and change depending on what he's going through. Background It is based in part on the author's first marriage, to Julia Urquidi. Urquidi later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What little Vargas didn't say), in which she provided her own version of their relationship. Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter combines a fictional account of a period in Vargas' own life with a picture of Lima in the 1950s, a satirical look at Peruvian radio soap operas, and an examination of both the practical and creative aspects of writing. Vargas Llosa's novel was later adapted as a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow, in which the setting was moved from Lima to New Orleans.

Only 100 copies of each of the two CDs have been made. In December 1975, Steve's older sister, Cassie, became a member of Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd's female backup singers, The Honkettes. The band had been seeking a replacement for Ed King, one of three lead guitarist in its lineup, since his departure in mid-1975. Cassie recommended Steve, and after initial reluctance the band allowed him to join them onstage for a song during a show at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri on May 11, 1976, Jimmie Rodgers' \\"T-For Texas, (Blue Yodel #1)\\". Although the band couldn't hear Steve's playing onstage, soundman Kevin Elson was listening through headphones and told them that Steve was outstanding. They jammed with him informally a couple of times more, then invited him into the band just in time for the recording of Skynyrd's live album One More from the Road. The first of three shows recorded for the album was Gaines' third gig with the band. Ed King and Steve Gaines were both born on September 14, 1949. Gaines' guitar-picking and songwriting skills were a major revelation to the band, as demonstrated on his one studio album, 1977's Street Survivors. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the vocal and instrumental skill of Skynyrd's newest member, claiming that the band would \\"all be in his shadow one day\\". Steve's contributions included his co-lead vocal with Ronnie on the co-written \\"You Got That Right\\" (a solid hit single released after the plane crash) and the rousing guitar boogie \\"I Know a Little\\" which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Steve's abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Steve delivering his self-penned bluesy \\"Ain't No Good Life\\" ‚Äì one of the few songs in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Van Zant. On October 20, 1977, three days after Street Survivors was released (and five dates into the band's most successful ticket sales tour yet), a plane carrying both musicians and crew between shows from Greenville, South Carolina to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, crashed outside of Gillsburg, Mississippi. The plane landed in a swampy area and crashed into trees, claiming Gaines, Van Zant, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot William Gray. Gaines was cremated and his ashes were buried in Orange Park, Florida in 1977, but were relocated to an undisclosed location after vandals broke into his and bandmate Ronnie Van Zant's tombs on June 29, 2000. Their mausoleums remain as memorials for fans to visit. 10 years later, the new location of their interment was accidentally revealed by a Craigslist ad. A family selling two plots they decided not to retain, ran a Craigslist ad and stated the plots were in the Jacksonville Memory Gardens Cemetery in Orange Park, Florida, adjacent to Ronnie Van Zant's tomb. https://www.clickorlando.com/pets/2012/04/19/craigslist-posting-reveals- ronnie-van-zants-burial-site/ He is the subject of the 2001 song \\"Cassie's Brother\\" by rock band Drive-By Truckers. Less than two years after the plane crash, Cassie LaRue Gaines, mother of Cassie and Steve, was killed in an automobile accident near the cemetery where her children were buried. She was buried near them.

Trade unionism In 1906 Walkden was appointed the fourth General Secretary of the Railway Clerks' Association (the modern Transport Salaried Staffs' Association) at a particularly important point in its history. His immediate predecessor, John Stopford Challener, had absconded with most of the union's money‚Äîa crime which was only discovered after he committed suicide in Paris. Walkden was an extremely able administrator and socialist, who in his thirty years as general secretary built up the impoverished union into a respected organisation which was influential in both the Labour Party and the trade union movement. In his period of office he was also influential in the creation of the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF). At thirty years (1906‚Äì1936) he is the longest-serving general secretary in the history of the RCA/TSSA, his nearest rival being the fifteen years served by Richard Rosser between 1989 and 2004. When the union built its new headquarters building adjacent to London's Euston railway station in the 1960s, it was named Walkden House in his honour. Political career Walkden unsuccessfully stood for Parliament as the Labour candidate in Wolverhampton West at the 1918 general election, at a by-election in 1922 and at the 1922 general election. He was unsuccessful again in Heywood and Radcliffe in 1924, but was elected at the 1929 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bristol South. Although seriously ill for much of the 1929‚Äì1931 Parliament, Walkden was active in pressing for legislation to create London Transport, a long-time policy of the union. The Labour government fell before the London Passenger Transport Act could be passed, and he lost his seat in the 1931 general election but as a union leader, he pressed the subsequent National Government to reintroduce the bill, which it did in 1932, and it came into effect in 1933. Walkden was re-elected for Bristol South at the 1935 general election, serving until he retired from the House of Commons at the 1945 general election. on 9 July 1945 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Walkden, of Great Bookham in the County of Surrey. He then served under Clement Attlee as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords) from 1945 until 1949. Personal life Lord Walkden died in April 1951, aged 77, when the barony became extinct.

It is a philosophical concept that became popular in the twentieth century, which maintains that cities as products of centuries‚Äô development should be obligated to protect their patrimonial legacy. The term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, Handbook (1997). History =England= In England, antiquarian interests were a familiar gentleman's pursuit since the mid 17th century, developing in tandem with the rise in scientific curiosity. Fellows of the Royal Society were often also Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries. The ruins of Berkhamsted castle (viewed from its Norman motte) and Berkhamsted Common were the location of two successful early preservation events in the nineteenth century. (Enlarged: A train passes Berkhamsted castle, on an embankment that was once part of the castle's outer defences.)Many historic sites were damaged as the railways began to spread across the UK; including Trinity Hospital and its church in Edinburgh, Furness Abbey, Berwick and Northampton Castle, and the ancient walls of York, Chester and Newcastle. In 1833 Berkhamsted Castle became the first historic site in England officially protected by statute under the London and Birmingham Railway Acts of 18331837, though the new railway line in 1834 did demolish the castle's gatehouse and outer earthworks to the south. Another early preservation event also occurred at Berkhamsted. In 1866, Lord Brownlow who lived at Ashridge, tried to enclose the adjoining Berkhamsted Common with steel fences in an attempt to claim it as part of his estate. In England from early Anglo-Saxon times, Common land was an area of land which the local community could use as a resource. Across England between 1660 and 1845, 7 million acres of Common land had been enclosed by private land owners by application to parliament. On the night of 6 March 1866, Augustus Smith MP led gangs of local folk and hired men from London's East End in direct action to break the enclosure fences and protect Berkhamsted Common for the people of Berkhamsted in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common.... In 1870, Sir Robert Hunter (later co-founder of the National Trust in 1895) and the Commons Preservation Society succeed in legal action that ensured protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust. John Lubbock, MP was a moving force behind the implementation of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. By the mid 19th century, much of Britain's unprotected cultural heritage was being slowly destroyed. Even well-meaning archaeologists like William Greenwell excavated sites with virtually no attempt at their preservation, Stonehenge came under increasing threat by the 1870s. Tourists were chipping off parts of the stones or carving their initials into the rock. The private owners of the monument decided to sell the land to the London and South-Western Railway as the monument was \\"not the slightest use to anyone now\\". John Lubbock, an MP and botanist emerged as the champion of the country's national heritage. In 1872 he personally bought private land that housed ancient monuments in Avebury, Silbury Hill and elsewhere, from the owners who were threatening to have them cleared away to make room for housing. Soon, he began campaigning in Parliament for legislation to protect monuments from destruction. This finally led to the legislative milestone under the Liberal government of William Gladstone of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. The first government appointed inspector for this job was the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers. This legislation was regarded by conservative political elements as a grave assault on the individual rights of property of the owner, and consequently, the inspector only had the power to identify endangered landmarks and offer to purchase them from the owner with his consent. The Act only covered ancient monuments and explicitly did not cover historic buildings or structures. In 1877 the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings was founded by the Arts and Crafts designer William Morris to prevent the destruction of historic buildings, followed by the National Trust in 1895 that bought estates from their owners for preservation.Bryson, Bill. \\"At Home: A Short History of Private Life\\" Transworld Publishers, 2010 The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 had only given legal protection to prehistoric sites, such as ancient tumuli. The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900 took this further by empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. Further updates were made in 1910. Tattershall Castle, preserved at personal expense by Lord Curzon and a catalyst for broader heritage protection laws. Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, a medieval manor house had been put up for sale in 1910 with its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, still intact. However, when an American bought the house they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. The former viceroy of India, George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, was outraged at this cultural destruction and stepped in to buy back the castle and reinstall the fireplaces. After a nationwide hunt for them they were finally found in London and returned. He restored the castle and left it to the National Trust on his death in 1925. His experience at Tattershall influenced Lord Curzon to push for tougher heritage protection laws in Britain, which saw passage as the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913. The new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments, and extended the public right of access to these. The term \\"monument\\" was extended to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.Mynors, p.9. The National Trust The National Trust was founded in 1894 by Octavia Hill, Sir Robert Hunter, and Hardwicke Canon Rawnsley as the first organisation of its type in the world. Its formal purpose is: > The preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and tenements > (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest and, as regards lands, > for the preservation of their natural aspect, features and animal and plant > life. Also the preservation of furniture, pictures and chattels of any > description having national and historic or artistic interest. In the early days, the Trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings; its first property was Alfriston Clergy House and its first nature reserve was Wicken Fen. Its first archaeological monument was White Barrow. The focus on country houses and gardens, which now comprise the majority of its most visited properties, came about in the mid 20th century, when it was realised that the private owners of many of these properties were no longer able to afford to maintain them. The Town and Country Planning Act 1944 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 took steps toward historic preservation on an unprecedented scale. Concern about the demolition of historic buildings arose in institutions such as the pressure group the Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings, which appealed against demolition and neglect on a case-by-case basis. English Heritage English Heritage formed in 1983, is a registered charity that looks after the National Heritage Collection in England. This comprises over 400 of England's historic buildings, monuments and sites spanning more than 5,000 years of history. Within its portfolio are Stonehenge, Dover Castle, Tintagel Castle and the best preserved parts of Hadrian's Wall. Originally English Heritage was the operating name of an executive non-departmental public body of the British Government, officially titled the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England, that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties. It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection. In 1999 the organisation merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England and the National Monuments Record (England), bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England's historic environment. On 1 April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts: Historic England, which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, and the new English Heritage Trust, a charity that would operate the historic properties, and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo. The British government gave the new charity an ¬£80 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust, although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state. =United States= Mount Vernon plantation, near Alexandria, Virginia In the United States one of the first historic preservation efforts was the Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site, in Newburgh, New York. This property has the distinction of being the first-ever property designated and operated as a historic site by a U.S. state, having been so since 1850. Another early historic preservation undertaking was that of George Washington's Mount Vernon in 1858.Lea, Diane. \\"America's Preservation Ethos: A Tribute to Enduring Ideals.\\" A Richer Heritage: Historic Preservation in the Twenty-First Century. ed. Robert Stipe. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. p.2 Founded in 1889, the Richmond, Virginia-based Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.Lindgren, James Michael. Preserving the Old Dominion: historic preservation and Virginia traditionalism. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1993. 3. Print. The American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society was formed in 1895 as the first American organization of its kind in the United States that did not limit its activities to a single historic place or object. The Society operated as a national organization to: protect the natural scenery and the preservation of historic landmarks; to preserve landmarks and records of the past or present; to erect memorials and promote appreciation of the scenic beauty of America.\\"Scenic and Historic America: Bulletin of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society.\\" ASHPS 2.1 (March 1930):3. Charles E. Peterson was an influential figure in the mid-20th century establishing the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), advising on the establishment of Independence National Historical Park, helping with the first graduate degree program in historic preservation in the United States at Columbia University, and author. The architectural firm of Simons & Lapham (Albert Simons and Samuel Lapham) was an influential supporter of the nation's first historic preservation ordinance in Charleston, South Carolina in 1930, affording that city a regulatory means by which to prevent the destruction of its historic building stock. In 1925, efforts to preserve the historic buildings of the French Quarter in New Orleans led to the creation of the Vieux Carr√© Commission and later, to the adoption of a historic preservation ordinance.Blevins, Documentation of the Architecture of the Architecture of Samuel Lapham and the Firm of Simons & Lapham, Masters of Fine Arts in Historic Preservation Thesis, Savannah College of Art & Design, 2001Ellis, Scott S. (2010). Madame Vieux Carr√©: the French Quarter in the Twentieth Century. University of Mississippi. p. 43. The preservation of this historic building in Washington, D.C. resulted in an award for Excellence in Historic Preservation by the local government. The US National Trust for Historic Preservation, another privately funded non-profit organization, began in 1949 with a handful of structures and has developed goals that provide \\"leadership, education, advocacy, and resources to save America's diverse historic places and revitalize our communities\\" according to the Trust's mission statement. In 1951 the Trust assumed responsibility for its first museum property, Woodlawn Plantation in northern Virginia. Twenty-eight sites in all have subsequently become part of the National Trust, representing the cultural diversity of American history. In New York City, the destruction of Pennsylvania Station in 1964 shocked many nationwide into supporting preservation. The 1960s proved advantageous with new laws and international agreements extending preservation \\"from ancient monuments to whole districts and buildings a few decades old.\\" On an international level, the New York-based World Monuments Fund was founded in 1965 to preserve historic sites all over the world. Under the direction of James Marston Fitch, the first advanced-degree historic preservation program began at Columbia University in 1964.Murtagh, William J. Keeping Time: The History and Theory of Preservation in America. New York: Sterling Publishing, Co., 1997. It became the model on which most other graduate historic preservation programs were created.Michael Tomlan. \\"Historic Preservation Education: Alongside Architecture in Academia.\\" Journal of Architectural Education, Vol. 47, No. 4. (1994): 187-196. Many other programs were to follow before 1980: M.A. in Preservation Planning from Cornell (1975); M.S. in Historic Preservation from the University of Vermont (1975); M.S. in Historic Preservation Studies from Boston University (1976); M.S. in Historic Preservation from Eastern Michigan University (1979) and M.F.A. in Historic Preservation was one of the original programs at Savannah College of Art & Design. James Marston Fitch also offered guidance and support towards the founding of the Master of Preservation Studies Degree within the Tulane School of Architecture in 1996. The M.Sc. in Building Conservation degree program is offered by the School of Architecture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. In 2005, Clemson University and the College of Charleston created an M.S. degree program based in Charleston, SC. The first undergraduate programs (B.A.) appeared in 1977 from Goucher College and Roger Williams University (then called Roger Williams College), followed by Mary Washington College in 1979.Preservation News (Oct 1, 1979) there were more than fifty historic preservation programs offering certificates, associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees in the United States. Under the direction of Jorge Otero-Pailos, the first PhD in Historic Preservation in the United States was founded at Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation in 2018. =Australia= APA Building was constructed in Queen Anne style in 1889 and demolished in 1981. All of Austalia's major cities have had historic or heritage preservation establishments and legislation in place since the mid to late 1970s, though destruction or outright demolition of historic buildings continues in most Australian cities to this day, subject to council or planning approval, particularly outside of the city centres in historic neighbourhoods. Melbourne was founded in 1835 and grew enormously in wealth and prosperity following the 1850s gold rush, which resulted in a construction boom: large edifices were erected to serve as public buildings such as libraries, court houses, schools, churches, and offices. This led to a period where Melbourne became known as \\"Marvellous Melbourne\\", boasting the largest collection of Victorian architecture outside of England. However, in the years that followed, and as the thousands of Australian soldiers arrived back from the battlefields following the end of World War I there emerged a sense of renewed pride and a willingness to forget the dark days of war and distance Australian from its Victorian origins, considered \\"unfashionable\\" or \\"outdated\\" by some. The Council of the City of Melbourne was no doubt buoyed by this new nationalistic pride and put in place schemes to modernize the city which included increasing the building height limit and removing some of the Victorian era cast ironwork. In the years leading up to World War II the Whelan the Wrecker firm had already pulled down thousands of structures in both the city and surrounding suburbs, as Melbourne became particularly conscious of International Modernism. James Paul Whelan's obituary of 1938 suggests that his company had the task of demolishing up to 98% of buildings marked for removal in the city alone.Obituary \\"WHELAN THE WRECKER\\" (1938, March 3). The Argus (Melbourne), p. 3. Retrieved February 22, 2014 The rise of this International Modernism saw a new approach that valued replacing older, elaborate inefficient buildings with new ones. An early example of this was a City of Melbourne by-law in 1954 that mandated the demolition of all posted cast-iron verandas,Doyle, Helen (2011). Thematic History ‚Äì A history of the City of Melbourne's urban environment. Context, Brunswick thought to be dangerous as well as old fashioned, in order to 'clean up' the city before the 1956 Summer Olympics. Sydney (Australia's oldest city) was also affected by the International Modernism period and also suffered an extensive loss of its Victorian architecture, something that subsisted well into the 1980s. From the 1950s onwards, many of Sydney's handsome sandstone and masonry buildings were wiped away by architects and developers who built \\"brown concrete monstrosities\\" in their place. The 1980s saw \\"uncomfortable pastiches of facades with no coherence and little artistic merit\\". Green bans in Australian cities such as Sydney and Melbourne came into effect in the 1970s and the Australian Heritage Commission (AHS), was established by the Federal Government in 1975 by the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 as the first body to manage natural and cultural heritage in Australia until its demise in 2004.Background notes (Australian Heritage Commission) Canberra: The Commission, 1983- . It was responsible for the Register of the National Estate. The Australian National Heritage List was established in 2003. Controversy arose in 2016 in Melbourne after the historic Corkman Irish Pub was illegally demolished overnight, resulting in the State Planning Minister pursuing an order (via the Victorian Administrative Appeals Tribunal) for the two-storey pub to be rebuilt. The site owners were fined AUD$1.325 million after pleading guilty to the process. In the city of Adelaide, large public protests erupted in the 1980s regarding the 1983 campaign to save the Aurora Hotel in Hindmarsh Square, which had been recommended for listing on the city heritage register but refused because the site was to be redeveloped. The protest led to the emergence of Aurora Heritage Action, Inc. (AHA), which became the most vocal heritage lobby group in Adelaide during the decade, often working in cooperation with residents' associations and later the National Trust. While governments were urged to protect the traditional character of Adelaide, capital became more widely available for development. The large increase in property development from 1987 increased opposition to further demolition of Adelaide's historic buildings. Local councils and lobbyists alike aimed to expand the horizon of heritage to protect historic precincts across the city, even if buildings within those precincts did not warrant heritage listing. The Bannon government slowly responded to public demand and introduced historic (conservation) zones through a revision to the Planning Act (1982) in 1989. Not regulated by the Planning Act, the City of Adelaide endeavoured to create on a similar scheme, which became known as the townscape initiative, facilitating one of the most destructive political debates in the council's history. =Canada= In Canada, the phrase \\"heritage preservation\\" is sometimes seen as a specific approach to the treatment of historic places and sites, rather than a general concept of conservation. \\"Conservation\\" is taken as the more general term, referring to all actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life. Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the central government, the provincial governments, or a municipal government. The Heritage Canada Foundation acts as Canada's lead advocacy organisation for heritage buildings and landscapes. = The Netherlands = Victor de Stuers is widely considered the man who started historic preservation in the Netherlands. In 1875 the first national department for conservation was established and de Stuers was appointed as the first legal secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs as chief of the brand new Department of Arts and Sciences. He was the driving force behind Monumentenzorg (Foundation for Historic Preservation), helped found the Rijksmuseum (National Museum) and the Rijksarchief (National Archives). However, it was not until the 20th century that there was national legislation on historic preservation. In 1961 the Monumentenwet (‚ÄúMonuments Act‚Äù) was passed. It defined that any physical building or space that was at least fifty years old and ‚Äúwhich are of general interest because of their beauty, their meaning to science or their social value‚Äù and must thus be preserved. In 1988 this Act was replaced by the Monumentenwet 1988 (‚ÄúMonuments Act 1988‚Äù) and in 2015 by the Erfgoedwet (‚ÄúHeritage Law‚Äù). In 1973, the NGO Monumentenwacht (‚ÄúMonument Watch‚Äù) was founded with the purpose of providing preventative measures of maintenance for historic buildings. As the majority of the historic preservation programs in the Netherlands, this program is decentralized, managed on the provincial level. Owners of heritage buildings can subscribe to the services of Monumentenwacht and receive regular visits for inspection. The costs are covered through a combination of national and provincial subsidies. A special kind of preservation that takes place in the Netherlands is the preservation of maritime heritage. Maritime trade was the Dutch specialty which shaped much of their culture and as a country that is 50% under sea level the Dutch history is closely intertwined with water. There are maritime museums in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam that tell the story of the Dutch maritime heritage, but there is not much legal documentation on how to preserve it. For example, according to Sarah Dromgoole,https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/law/people/sarah.dromgoole shipwrecks from The Dutch East India Company are found all around the world, which are still property of the Netherlands, but the Dutch government rarely takes responsibility for this property that is found outside of their territory. = North Macedonia = In North Macedonia, historic preservation falls under the overarching category of cultural heritage preservation according to the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage (–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –∑–∞ –∑–∞—à—Ç–∏—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –∫—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ). According to this law, which the Macedonian Parliament approved in March 2004, there are three types of cultural heritage: immovable, movable, and intangible. Historical preservation is represented by the protection of monuments and monumental entireties under immovable cultural heritage, and historical items under movable cultural heritage.‚Äú–ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –∑–∞ –∑–∞—à—Ç–∏—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –∫—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ‚Äù (PDF). ‚Äû–°–ª. –í–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫ –Ω–∞ –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞‚Äú –±—Ä.20/04.

Retrieved 2017-11-08 Although this Law was the first nation- wide establishment of regulations for historic preservation since North Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, several organizations throughout the 20th century have encompassed efforts of historic preservation. The ‚ÄúCentral office for protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia‚Äù has existed since 1949. In 1960, the Central Office was renamed to ‚ÄúNational office for protection of cultural monuments‚Äù, and granted the status of an independent cultural institution, with authority to execute activities of historic preservation. After the establishment of the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage in 2004, the Ministry of Culture once again renamed the office to ‚ÄúNational center for conservation‚Äù and narrowed down its responsibilities to dealing solely with preservation of immovable cultural heritage.Jovcevska, Biljana. ‚ÄúAbstract‚Äù (PDF). ftu.uklo,edu.mk (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08. Other organizations which have contributed to the efforts of historic preservation are the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS and the NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum-Ohrid. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) established their branch in North Macedonia in 1995 through the initiative of 43 conservationists from Macedonia. The guiding principles of the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS are raising the national consciousness about the importance of historic and cultural heritage, decentralization of the discourse about heritage, and effective monitoring of the status of cultural and historic heritage in the country.‚ÄúICOMOS Macedonia About Us‚Äù. icomos.org.mk (in Macedonian).

Both laws were adapted from the British law that was implemented during the British Mandate of Palestine. However, these laws are not comprehensive and limited in scope: the Antiquities Law only applies itself to buildings or artifacts dated before 1700 BC. So while efforts discovering and protecting anything older than 1700 BC are well protected, anything from later historical periods is not under the protection of this law. The Planning and Building Law discusses the overall management and regulation of land use in Israel. It has been through several changes and amendments specifically regarding preservation, but over the years it hasn't been enforced and many historical sites were destroyed, as the state was prioritizing developmental and economic interests. During the 1960s, the issue of preservation was gaining public awareness, and as a response to the destruction of Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium (one of the first educational institutions in Israel) in 1959, a wave of shock and anger led to extensive public debate.Klein Halevi, Yossi (2011). ◊î◊ê◊û◊®◊ß◊†◊ô◊ñ◊¶◊ô◊î ◊©◊ú ◊™◊ú ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë. In 1984, The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel was established, at the recommendation of the Knesset and the Committee of Education. Its aims include locating remains of historic settlements, protect and conserve them as well as developing conservation principles that are specific to Israel's historic situations and are aligned with international standards. The council used to operate under the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel but in 2008 registers as an independent non-profit. Today, it is the organization responsible for the most historical preservation endeavors as well as efforts to add amendments to existing laws to provide a comprehensive and effective framework for preservation in Israel. A different, separate effort in preservation comes from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). The IDF surveyed 94 military bases and found that about 80 of them include sites worth preserving, and for each of these bases there is a preservation plan.The Ministry of Defense statement regarding preservation within IDF bases [Hebrew] The IDF is working towards maintaining these building as well as communicating their value to the soldiers in these bases. Buildings include Knights Templar sites, old military bases used by the British or German or buildings from the Ottoman period. National Register of Historic Places National Register of Historic Places plaque =National Historic Landmark= =Historic districts= A historic district in the United States is a group of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few. The U.S. federal government designates historic districts through the U.S. Department of Interior, under the auspices of the National Park Service. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Federal, State and Local Historic Districts , TOOLBOX, FAQ, National Park Service. Retrieved 19 February 2007 Historic districts allows rural areas to preserve their characters through historic preservation programs. These include \\"Main Street\\" programs that can be used to redevelop rural downtowns. Using historic preservation programs as an economic development tool for local governments in rural areas has enabled some of those areas to take advantage of their history and develop a tourism market that in turn provides funds for maintaining an economic stability that these areas would not have seen otherwise.John, Patricia LaCaille (July 2008). \\"Historic Preservation Resources.\\" Rural Information Center Publication Series no. 62.

A similar concept exists in the United Kingdom: a Conservation area is designated in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 in order to protect a zone in which there are buildings of architectural or cultural heritage interest. National Parks In 1835, the English poet William Wordsworth described the Lake District as a \\"sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy.\\" It was, however, the United States that led the world in the creation of National Parks, areas of unspoiled natural wilderness, where the intrusion of civilization are intentionally minimal. The Department of the Interior designated several areas of Morristown, New Jersey as the first historic park in the United States national park system. It became designated as the Morristown National Historical Park. The community had permanent settlements that date to 1715, is termed the military capital of the American Revolution, and contains many designations of sites and locations. The park includes three major sites in Morristown. In the United Kingdom, James Bryce the ambassador to the US praised the system of National Parks and campaigned to have them introduced in Great Britain. Little came of it until mounting public pressure during the early 20th century from the Ramblers' Association and other groups led to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.  UNESCO  The Fortress of Suomenlinna from 18th century in Helsinki, Finland is one of the most significant UNESCO's World Heritage sites since 1991.Fortress of Suomenlinna - UNESCO World Heritage Centre According to UNESCO's 1972 World Heritage Convention, landscapes and sites of outstanding universal value can be designated as World Heritage Sites. The World Heritage Convention encompasses historic preservation under the category of ‚Äúcultural heritage‚Äù. According to Article 1 of the convention, monuments, groups of buildings, and sites ‚Äúwhich are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science‚Äù are to be designated cultural heritage. A requirement of such designation is that the designating nation has appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures in place to identify, protect, conserve, present, and rehabilitate world heritage sites. However, according to Article 6 of the convention, while sovereignty of the State where the site is located is not to be compromised, the State acknowledges that protection of heritage sites is a duty of the entire international community. The World Heritage convention's counterpart, The World Heritage Committee,The World Heritage Committee is the body responsible for the practical implementation of the convention as well as managing and deciding how to use the World Heritage Fund. The committee also gets to have the final say when determining whether a property will be included in the World Heritage List. The Committee meets once a year and includes representatives from 21 states that are part of the States Parties. Yearly reports are available to the public on the World Heritage website and include outlines of decisions made, outcomes, working documents and various reports.All available reports of the Committee International partner of UNESCO is Blue Shield International. From a national and international perspective, there are many cooperations with Blue Shield organizations and with United Nations peacekeeping to ensure the sustainable existence of cultural assets.Roger O‚ÄôKeefe, Camille P√©ron, Tofig Musayev, Gianluca Ferrari: Protection of Cultural Property.

Since the 1990s, more effort has been put forth to improve the presentation of women's history. \\"Guidebooks to women's landmarks have sometimes failed to distinguish between the presence of historic resources and subsequent construction on sites of significance in women's history, making an actual visit to the site a somewhat disappointing experience for visitors.\\"  Potential challenges  Although preservation efforts can have benefits for the owners of historical buildings, such as tax cuts and subsidies, there are also drawbacks. One such drawback is that after a neighborhood has been designated to be historically preserved, there is less construction. On the long term this can affect the value of property and investment in housing, both in the neighborhood itself and the neighborhoods directly surrounding it. A second concern that has been raised is that buildings that need to be historically preserved are sometimes still inhabited. In some cases their inability to make changes to the building can lead to dangerous or unhealthy situations for residents.Li, C. (2012).

It is not true that nothing could be changed or renovated, but the owner of the building would need to ask permission at the appropriate preservation society, slowing the process down severely. The exact policies are country dependent.Barrett, J. (2016). Getting Away From \\"No\\": Straight Talk to Local Advocates. Forum Journal 30(2), 46-49. National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The novel provides a narrative attempting a demythologized account of the events surrounding the life of Jesus and the origin of Christianity. Plot introduction Written from the viewpoint of Nathan ('the Thirteenth Disciple'), the heavily footnoted book presents an adventure and romance storyline against the backdrop of the 1st century Roman Empire. Nathan's travels lead him to Rome to fight as a retiarius, and on his return to Palestine to become involved with the Apostles, the Zealots and the Essenes. He loves Shelomith (the disciple Salome, depicted in the novel as a prostitute), who does not return his affections due to her unrequited love for Yeshua (Jesus). Main themes This story is simultaneously used as a vehicle for Yerby's examination of the historical personalities and Christian beliefs through the ideas of critical theological writings. The book is written from a strongly skeptical viewpoint: For miracles he offers alternative physical explanations, such as mistaken identity, discrepancies in traditional Jewish and Essene calendars, and other explanations of varying plausibility. On the frontispiece, Yerby warns \\"those emotionally dependent upon the Christian Religion\\" to read no further. The sleeve notes continue: : This novel touches on only two issues which, in a certain sense, might be called controversial: whether any man truly has the right to believe fanciful and childish nonsense; and whether any organization has the right to impose, by almost imperial fiat, belief in things that simply are not so. To me, irrationality is dangerous; perhaps the most dangerous force stalking through the world today. This novel, then, is one man's plea for an ecumenicism broad enough to include reasonable men; and his effort to defend his modest intellect from intolerable insult, Though Yerby is skeptical of Biblical accounts of supernatural 'miracles', he presents the character 'Yeshua' as a man of strong moral character, deep compassion and keen insight into human nature, with a remarkable ability to inspire loyalty in his followers. Nathan finally concludes that the true miracle of Christianity is that a man could inspire such love in his disciples that they refuse to let him die; by sheer force of love they resurrect Him in their minds because they cannot live on without him. Faced with this realization, Nathan becomes himself a disciple and devotes his life and wealth to the propagation of his new faith. 1968 American novels American historical novels Novelistic portrayals of Jesus ","title":"Judas, My Brother"},{"id":"1219816","text":"John W.

In April 2006, the OpenCourseWare website of \\"Visualizing Cultures\\" was announced on the main page of the MIT website, causing a stir among some Chinese students at MIT that found the material offensive.CNN The material included woodblock prints produced in Japan as propaganda during the Chinese-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì1895 that portrayed Japanese soldiers beheading \\"violent Chinese soldiers.\\" The Japanese-born Miyagawa received death threats. In response, the authors temporarily removed the course from OpenCourseWare and released a statement, as did the MIT Administration.

Walker (1834) was a \\"freedom suit\\" filed by Rachel, an African- American slave, in the St. Louis Circuit Court. She petitioned for her freedom and that of her son James (John) Henry from William Walker (a slave trader), based on having been held illegally as a slave in the free territory of Michigan by a previous master, an Army officer. Her case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri, where she won. The court ruled that an Army officer forfeited his slave if he took the person to territory where slavery is prohibited.\\"Timeline of Missouri's African American History\\", Missouri State Archives, Missouri Digital History, accessed 18 February 2011 This ruling was cited as precedent in 1856 in the famous Dred Scott v. Sandford case before the Supreme Court of the United States.\\"Curiae\\", Law School, Yale University Rachel's was one of 301 19th-century freedom suits found among St. Louis Circuit Court records in the 1990s; it is the largest group of case files in the country available to researchers. The Missouri History Museum's research center maintains a searchable database online of the freedom suits. History While slaves had no legal standing as citizens, under an 1824 Missouri state law, they were entitled to file as \\"poor people\\" to sue for freedom. If the court believed that the case had substantive grounds, it would assign counsel to represent the slave. The law further provided that the slaveholder must allow the slave time to consult with counsel and prohibited taking the slave from the jurisdiction of the court until the case was heard. In the case, the court assigned Josiah Spalding as counsel to represent Rachel in her case. She had been held by the army lieutenant Thomas Stockton at Fort Snelling (present-day Minnesota), and her son had been born in 1834 at Fort Crawford, (present-day Wisconsin), both in the Michigan Territory (a free territory)at that time. Stockton had returned with Rachel and James Henry to St. Louis, where he sold them. The second owner resold them to the slave trader William Walker, who planned to take them \\"downriver\\" (down the Mississippi) for likely sale in New Orleans. Rachel sued for freedom based on having been illegally held as a slave during lengthy residence in free territories. Although the lower court ruled against Rachel, Spalding appealed the case to the Missouri Supreme Court. In 1836, it ruled in favor of Rachel in one of the decisions that established \\"its tendency to enforce the laws of the neighboring free states\\" that a slaveholder forfeited rights to a slave by taking the person into free territory. By the time the case reached the State Supreme Court, it involved only Rachel. After her victory, she had to file a separate suit to free her son James Henry but was successful. The court continued with the precedent of Winny v. Whitesides (1824) in which the state supreme court held that a slave was free after having been held illegally in a free state and \\"once free always free.\\"id=Kt_qJU3SVs8C&pg;=PA127&dq;=Neither+Fugitive+nor+Free:+Atlantic+Slavery,+Freedom+Suits,+and+the+Legal+Culture+of+Travel,&source;=gbs_toc_r&cad;=3#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Edlie L. Wong, Neither Fugitive nor Free: Atlantic Slavery, Freedom Suits, and the Legal Culture of Travel, New York University Press, 2009, p. 135, accessed 26 January 2011 Specifically, the it held that \\"if an officer of the United States Army takes a slave to a territory where slavery is prohibited, he forfeits his property.\\" The case was based on a girl, \\"Winny,\\" who petitioned the Missouri Supreme Court, and her case established the Missouri precedent for freeing slaves who had lived in free territory. She claimed that her owner Phoebe Whitesides had been imprisoned without cause. Whitesides had moved from North Carolina to St. Louis, Missouri. If she were declared free, her nine children and grandchildren would also be declared free. This case went to trial and the St. Louis circuit court on 13 February 1822. The jury's decision freed Winny and her descendants. Whitesides appealed the case and it came before the Missouri Supreme Court in 1824. Again, the court decision favored Winny and her descendants. The court ruled, \\"We are clearly of opinion that if, by a residence in Illinois (Whitesides) lost her right to the property in the defendant, that right was not revived by a removal, of the parties to Missouri.\\"Gateway Heritage Magazine, Vol.14, No.3, A Ray of Hope, Extinguished: St. Louis Slave Suits for Freedom.

Walker, William, accessed 26 January 2011 Decision Justice Mathias McGirk of the Missouri Supreme Court said that Stockton had \\"willfully procured a slave and held her, unlawfully, in free territories, an act punishable by forfeiture of the slave, as decreed by territorial law.\\" With this ruling, he was supporting the laws of the neighboring free territories and states and closing a loophole by which Army officers had tried to argue they could keep slaves. Stockton had argued that he had no choice in his assignments with the Army, so should not have to lose his slave property as a result.Wong (2009), p. 137 Rachel's success in this case gave her the basis to successfully sue for freedom for her son James Henry; as he was born to a woman held illegally as a slave in a free state (and freed on those grounds), he was also free, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, in which the child gained his social status from his mother.

The Peoria fired several shots with her three-pounders into the fort but there was no response. Before dropping off mules, men, and materiel, a party of 30 Cubans and Americans led by Captain Jose Manuel N√∫√±ez (brother of General N√∫√±ez) and including Winthrop Chanler and Dr. William Louis Abbott, went ashore to ensure the safety of the landing site, about 500 yards east of the fort.\\"In a Hot Engagement: Captain Nunez was Killed, Winthrop Chanler and Five Others Wounded.\\" The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, WA July 14, 1898, p. 2.Dennis Bell was awarded the Medal of Honor after participating in the rescue of Cuban soldiers on the beach at Tayacoba.

Zicari (born August 5, 1974), known as Rob Black, is an American pornographer, radio host and former professional wrestling promoter. Together with his then wife Janet Romano (a.k.a. Lizzy Borden) he owned the porn company Extreme Associates. Zicari was prosecuted for distribution of obscenity by the United States Department of Justice in 2004. The case was dismissed but was reinstated upon appeal in 2005. Zicari entered into a plea agreement with the government in 2009 ending the case. (See United States v. Extreme Associates.)  Career  Zicari, son of an adult bookstore owner, started out as a porn director in the mid 1990s. His former porn company Extreme Video was started in 1993/1994 and eventually developed into the present-day Extreme Associates. Black appeared as himself in the documentary film Sex: The Annabel Chong Story (1999). His work often involved scenes considered egregious and extreme even by other members of the pornography industry, such as adult performers acting as young girls, or a simulated rape of a disabled person in a wheelchair in Miscreants (1997). In 1998, he founded the porn company, Extreme Associates, together with fellow porn directors Tom Byron and Van Damage and porn star Tiffany Mynx (who have since left the company). Janet Romano started to work for him in the same year, first as an actress and then as a director. Beginning in 2000, Zicari and AVN Magazine engaged in a \\"propaganda war\\" against one another, and as a result, Black's products were not reviewed or advertised in that trade magazine for several years. In 2001 Zicari (as Rob Black) unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Los Angeles, receiving 789 votes.http://161.149.221.240/clk/elections/ND4567.pdf Rob Zicari is nephew to porn entrepreneur Charles Zicari, a.k.a. Chuck Zane and cousin to fellow pornographers Mark and Matt Zane.  Obscenity prosecution  The filming of Lizzy Borden's movie Forced Entry, which included several simulated rapes, was covered in the PBS Frontline documentary American Porn (2002); the makers of the documentary were repulsed and walked off the set. The filming of the movie was also a part of documentary produced for BBC 2 hosted by Louis Theroux which follows various figures of the porn industry. Theroux also leaves the set in a similar manner to that of the PBS documentary. After, Zicari was interviewed in the documentary and challenged Attorney General John Ashcroft. These scenes possibly led to the subsequent undercover operation by federal authorities. In April 2003, the premises of Extreme Associates were raided by federal agents. Zicari, his then wife Lizzy Borden and his company were indicted for distributing obscene pornographic materials. The case is United States v. Extreme Associates. Zicari's company is located in Northridge near Los Angeles, but the trial took place in Pittsburgh, from where under-cover agents had ordered the offending materials. Zicari remained in business during the trial; he continued to market and sell the five tapes that are at the center of the prosecution as The Federal Five, with a portion of the sales price going to his defense fund. Note that buyers of those materials do not break the law, since mere possession of obscenity (unlike production and distribution) is not illegal. In April 2004, Zicari engaged in a public dispute with fellow pornographer Larry Flynt, who also had to fight various obscenity trials in the past. Zicari asked the adult industry for financial support to aid in his defense; Flynt declined, saying that he only promotes consensual sex and that Zicari's actions harmed the industry as a whole. Zicari's lawyer H. Louis Sirkin initially argued that laws against the distribution of obscenity were unconstitutional since people have a right to own obscenity, but this argument was rebuffed on appeal. After 6 years of legal costs, Black and his wife both plead guilty to the reinstated federal obscenity charges in hopes to avoid more extensive loss and penalties if they lost at actual trial. Zicari and his wife were both sentenced to one year and one day in prison on July 1, 2009. In late September the couple began serving their prison sentences, Zicari at La Tuna Federal Correctional Institution in Texas and his wife at Waseca Federal Correctional Institution in Minnesota. Instead of reporting to the intended minimum-security satellite facility, Zicari mistakenly reported to the prison's primary facility, where officials placed him in solitary confinement for nearly a month because it \\"was the only space they had available.\\" In March 2013, Zicari revealed on his radio show, The Rob Black Show, that he was actually placed in solitary because he was mistakenly designated as a sex offender because of the obscenity charges.  Xtreme Pro Wrestling  In 1999, Zicari and Tom Byron founded the Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) independent professional wrestling promotion. He appeared on shows as the owner as well as a manager under the name of Rob Black. His heel (bad guy) stable was called the \\"Black Army\\" and featured wrestlers such as John Kronus, Terry Funk, Abdullah the Butcher, and Juventud Guerrera. XPW folded in 2003 because of issues related to the obscenity prosecution, and in 2004 Zicari sold the company's footage to Xtreme Entertainment Group. In 2012, Zicari regained control and ownership of XPW. XPW was to make a comeback in late 2013, but the project never materialized due to insufficient backing. The Rob Black Show In March 2013, Zicari launched The Rob Black Show on Blog Talk Radio. It quickly ruffled the feathers of the porn establishment. The Daily Beast called him \\"Porn's Dirty Whistleblower\\" for revealing unsafe practices on set, business arrangements that exploit performers and common sidelines such as porn talent agents working their charges on escort sites.

He is most famous as the creator of the comic strip Barney Google, later retitled Barney Google and Snuffy Smith. The strip was especially popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and featured a number of well-known characters, including the title character, Bunky, Snuffy Smith, and Spark Plug the race horse. Spark Plug was a merchandising phenomenon, and has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s. DeBeck drew with a scratchy line in a \\"big-foot\\" style, in which characters had giant feet and bulbous noses. His strips often reflected his love of sports. In 1946, the National Cartoonists Society inaugurated the Billy DeBeck Memorial Awards (or the Barney Awards), which became the Reuben Award in 1954. Life and career =Early life= William Morgan DeBeck was born on April 15, 1890 on the South Side of Chicago, where his father, Louis DeBeck, was a newspaperman employed by the Swift Company. The elder DeBeck was French, and the name DeBeck was originally spelled DeBecque. His Irish-Welsh mother, Jessie Lee Morgan, had lived on a farm and was a schoolteacher. =Early career= After graduating from Hyde Park High School in 1908, DeBeck attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. He sold cartoon drawings during this time to finance himself, at first in 1908 for the Chicago Daily News. His caricatures of models drew the attention of his fellow students, and though he had intended to become a painter in the Flemish tradition, he quit the Academy after two years after he got a cartooning job with the weekly paper Show World in 1910. His cartoons showed the influence of John T. McCutcheon and Clare Briggs, whom he had admired in his youth; he also had the skill to draw in the more fastidiously cross- hatched style of a Charles Dana Gibson, copies of whose drawings he sold as originals. Sports fan DeBeck with boxing heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey in 1919. DeBeck soon left Show World for better opportunities at Youngstown Telegram in Ohio as an editorial cartoonist, then again at the Pittsburgh Gazette-Time in late August 1912. He later contributed cartoons to the New York City humor magazines Life and Judge. While living in Pittsburgh, he traveled to New York to show comic strip samples to Arthur Brisbane, an editor working for William Randolph Hearst's newspaper empire; Brisbane rejected the work. DeBeck later stated the examples \\"were terrible\\" as he \\"had been doing political cartoons for the Pittsburgh Gazette, and the comics were new\\" to him. He returned to Youngstown and married Marion Louise Shields there in 1914. Some time later they divorced, remarried in 1921, and eventually divorced again. In May 1915, DeBeck and a partner named Carter launched a newspaper syndicate and correspondence cartooning course; DeBeck's advice to his correspondence students was: \\"First learn how to draw‚Äîthen go to a good art school and get a firm foundation in the arts\\". The school was not a success, and DeBeck returned to Chicago and joined the Chicago Herald in December 1915. He worked on a strip called Finn an' Haddie for the Adams Newspaper Service on the side. On December 9, immediately after starting at the Herald, he began a strip called Married Life that so caught the attention of Hearst; legend says that, to acquire DeBeck, Hearst bought the Herald and merged it with the Chicago Examiner, as DeBeck had refused to join the Hearst empire after the Examiner raised his monthly salary from $35 to $200. DeBeck's creations were first adapted to film when an animated version of Married Life appeared in a Seattle Sunday Times newsreel in 1917. DeBeck created a number of other features, especially for the sports section, while his antics made him something of a local celebrity. =Barney Google= DeBeck introduced the popular race horse Spark Plug on July 17, 1922. On June 17, 1919, a new comic strip by DeBeck in the vein of Married Life debuted on the sports page; Take Barney Google, For Instance. It differed in that it was about a henpecked, sports-obsessed husband and his travails defying his wife. Google was interested in non-fictional sports stories, such as the heavyweight championship between Jess Willard and Jack Dempsey. It was not long before DeBeck refigured the tall, thin Google into the short, squat character he was to be remembered as, and the title too was soon shortened to Barney Google. It was not popular until DeBeck had Google acquire a race horse named Spark Plug (nicknamed \\"Sparky\\") in a strip dated July 17, 1922. The dilapidated, blanket- covered horse became such a marketing and merchandising phenomenon that the character has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s‚Äîtoys, balloons, and games were among the popular items adorned with Sparky's image. When DeBeck introduced the horse, he also introduced a little-used technique into the strip: continuity. Barney Google went from being a gag-a-day strip to one in which both humor and suspense kept readers coming back each day, as Google desperately tried to get his horse to win a race. The sequence in which Spark Plug was introduced into the strip was republished in the October 1922 issue of Comic Monthly‚Äîlikely the earliest newsstand comics periodical. DeBeck kept readers on the edges of their seats with uncertain suspense: sometimes Spark Plug actually won a race. While DeBeck resisted at first, Hearst demanded a pretty girl be introduced into the strip. DeBeck brought in Sweet Mama, which initially created a stir, and certain papers dropped the strip, but after the phrase swept the nation, the strip's popularity only increased. Over the years, DeBeck was credited with introducing more neologisms and catchphrases, such as \\"heebie-jeebies\\", \\"horsefeathers\\", \\"balls of fire\\" and \\"time's a-wastin'\\". In 1923, Billy Rose penned a Tin Pan Alley pop hit called \\"Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes)\\". A series of Barney Google live-action films starring Barney Hellum appeared in 1928 and 1929. DeBeck's assistant Paul Fung (pictured) took over Barney Googles topper Bughouse Fables in the 1920s. DeBeck had included a topper called Bughouse Fables (signed \\"Barney Google)\\" with his main strip since 1921, though he soon handed it off to assistant Paul Fung. On May 16, 1926, he replaced Bughouse Fables with Parlor, Bedroom & Sink Starring Bunky, a strip that was popular enough on its own to survive until 1948. According to later Barney Google and Snuffy Smith scripter Brian Walker, DeBeck had become \\"one of the highest-paid cartoonists in America\\" at this point. In the early 1920s, DeBeck moved to Riverside Drive in New York City, and in 1927 remarried Mary Louise Dunne. The couple spent the next two years in Europe, after which they settled down again in New York. DeBeck's active lifestyle sometimes caused him to miss deadlines. He enjoyed traveling, deep sea fishing, golf and playing bridge. As a golfer since 1916, DeBeck spent time on courses with such notables as Harold Lloyd, Walter Huston, Rube Goldberg, Fontaine Fox, Clarence Budington Kelland and bridge authority P. Hal Sims. He was also acquainted with such celebrities as Babe Ruth, Lowell Thomas and Damon Runyon. His best friend was the cartoonist Frank Willard, who also attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. =Snuffy Smith= Barney Googles popularity persisted into the Depression era; in 1933, Fortune magazine reported DeBeck's weekly earnings at $1200. In the spring of 1933, DeBeck hired 17-year-old Fred Lasswell as an assistant after seeing a big poster of Lasswell's funny, characters, rushing to the Tampa Chamber of Commerce Jamboree. Billy De Beck was a refined city gentleman, an avid golfer, world traveler, and bon vivant. He wanted to create a rural down-home character with whom depression-era audiences could relate. He needed some help. Fred Lasswell was a confirmed hayseed from the sticks with much kinfolk wisdom, make-do humor, a talent for drawing clean lines and blending funny images with text. Fred Lasswell recalls his \\"big tour with Billy\\" and the copious notes DeBeck took of Hillbilly phrases, while young Fred, drew sketches of backwoods characters, critters and scenes he already knew. The result became comic strip history, in 1934, when Snuffy Smith met Barney Google and sales for the Billy's Barney Google Comic Strip, soon to become Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, soared. Over the next seven years, Lasswell became the son DeBeck never had. He showed Lasswell a world of people who were the very best in their fields. He sent him to apprentice with some of the great illustrators, to study at the Art Students League, in New York and to walk the streets of the city with a sketchbook to capture the movement, personalities and situations he saw. After eight years of mentoring Fred Lasswell, Billy passed away and Lasswell took over his mentor's strip. Under Lasswell Barney Google and Snuffy Smith has become the longest continuously produced comic strip in American's newspaper history. DeBeck gained a growing interest into the culture of Appalachia in the 1930s and amassed a library on the subject that he later donated to Virginia Commonwealth University. Among the books he admired were those featuring Sut Lovingood by George Washington Harris; inside Sut Lovingood Yarns (1867) DeBeck produced his first sketch of Snuffy Smith, a character that grew from talking with and sketching the Appalachian hillbilly locals. Just as the strip's circulation was starting to flag, DeBeck introduced Snuffy in a storyline in which Barney inherited an estate in the mountains of North Carolina. After dodging the ornery hillbilly's bullets, the two became fast friends. The strip was eventually renamed Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, and Snuffy would take over from Barney Google as the central character. Lasswell, with his own country roots, provided much of the inspiration for Snuffy and his Appalachian environment. Especially, he provided a source for the locals' dialect. Hillbilly culture enjoyed much popularity in the 1930s; Snuffy Smith appeared the same year as Al Capp's Li'l Abner. By 1940, DeBeck's strip appeared in 210 newspapers with a combined circulation of ten million. The Charles Mintz studios produced four full-color animated Barney Google and Snuffy Smith shorts in 1935. The series had two more live-action adaptations in 1942: Bud Duncan starred as Snuffy Smith in Private Snuffy Smith and co-starred with Cliff Nazarro as Barney Google in Hillbilly Blitzkrieg. =Later life and death= DeBeck had a studio apartment on Park Avenue in New York, and homes in Great Neck in New York and St. Petersburg in Florida. In the early 1940s, he developed cancer and found it increasingly difficult to work. Sensing his end was near, he made a special trip to see Marian Shields. His last signed daily strip appeared July 4, 1942, and his last Sunday the following August 2. With Lasswell contributing to the war effort, the strip continued under an assistant, Joe Musial. On November 11, 1942, DeBeck died at the age of 52 in New York City, with his wife at his bedside. They had no children. Barney Google appeared in 206 newspapers at the time, and Musial continued the strip until Lasswell took it on full-time in 1945. Over time, Barney faded from the strip, and the title contracted to Snuffy Smith. In 1943, Mary DeBeck donated to the Ringling School of Art all of her husband's art supplies, including drawing tables, reams of drawing paper, hundreds of colored pencils, lamps, drawing boards, inks, drawing pens, artist smocks, etching plates, and an etching press. She remarried, and died February 14, 1953, aboard National Airlines Flight 470, a DC-6 that fell into the Gulf of Mexico during a thunderstorm on a flight from Tampa to New Orleans. Style Hearst empire. DeBeck's drawing style falls in the \\"big- foot\\" tradition of American comic strips such as The Katzenjammer Kids, H√§gar the Horrible, and Robert Crumb. It had a scratchy line and characters with bulbous noses and giant feet. Though he often procrastinated, DeBeck could work quickly and make it just in time for his deadlines. DeBeck put Barney Google through great changes throughout his twenty-three-year run on the strip, changing situations and characters frequently. The storylines reflected the outlook of the 1920s boom years, the Great Depression, and World War II. Legacy DeBeck's main strip continued in the hands of Fred Lasswell long after its creator's death. The number of newspaper that carried it had been flagging in the years leading to DeBeck's passing, partly because the hillbilly dialect in the dialogue was difficult to read for many. The syndicate informed Lasswell that if many more newspapers dropped the strip, it would be canceled. Lasswell refocused on Snuffy Smith, dropped much of the dialect, and moved away from continuity to a gag-a-day format. The strip's popularity once again increased, and by 1989 it was running in 900 newspapers in 21 countries. It has continued in different hands since Lasswell's death in 2001. Debeck's hillbilly depictions, though stereotyped and distorted, had a higher degree of accuracy that those of Al Capp or other contemporary cartoonists, and painted hillbillies in a better light. DeBeck included authentic expressions such as \\"plime-blank\\" (\\"exactly\\") and \\"a lavish of\\" (\\"a lot of\\"), and included explanations of dialect unfamiliar to his readers. Some such as country singer Roy Acuff objected that the strip perpetuated stereotypes of hillbilly culture. DeBeck is credited with introducing or popularizing a number of neologisms and catchphrases via Barney Google, including \\"heebie-jeebies\\", \\"horsefeathers\\", \\"hotsy totsy\\", \\"balls of fire\\", \\"time's a-wastin'\\", \\"touched in the head\\", and \\"bodacious\\". Charles M. Schulz, creator of the Peanuts comic strip, was nicknamed \\"Sparky\\" after DeBeck's racehorse character, and DeBeck's drawing style has been an influence on contemporary cartooning and popular culture, and on such later cartoonists as Robert Crumb and Bobby London. The Barney Google Sunday page for September 18, 1938 was placed in the time capsule at the 1939 World's Fair. The National Cartoonists Society's annual award was originally named the Billy DeBeck Memorial Award. Created by Mary DeBeck Bergman in 1946, these were known as the Barney Awards. She also made the annual presentation of engraved silver cigarette cases, with DeBeck's characters etched on the cover, to the winners (Milton Caniff, Al Capp, Chic Young, Alex Raymond, Roy Crane, Walt Kelly, Hank Ketcham and Mort Walker). In 1954, after her death, the DeBeck Award was renamed the Reuben Award after Rube Goldberg, and all of the earlier winners were re-awarded Reuben statuettes.

In 1958, he was named by a Senate crime investigating subcommittee \\"the country's most important criminal\\". Ricca died on October 11, 1972. Early life Ricca was born Felice De Lucia on November 14, 1897, in Naples, Campania to Antonio and Maria Annunziata De Lucia. He had four minor sisters: Emilia Beatrice, Anna Clementina, Celementina Eleonora, and Luisa Maria. By age 17, he was working for organized crime in Naples (Camorra). In 1915, he stabbed Emilio Parrillo to death on Mafia orders. Ricca later claimed that he killed Parillo for breaking an engagement to his sister. In 1917, Ricca was convicted of murder, serving two years in prison. After being released from prison, Ricca then killed Vincenzo Capasso, who had testified against him in the Parillo trial, by slitting his throat. After killing Capasso, Ricca assumed the name Paul Maglio and fled to the United States by way of Cuba. On August 10, 1920, Ricca arrived in New York City. In 1927, Ricca married Nancy Emily Gigante, who was also from Naples, and had three children: Mary Anna, Anthony Paul, and Paul Richard. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1928, and legally changed his name to Paul De Lucia. Joining the mob While in Cuba, Ricca had met Joseph \\"Diamond Joe\\" Esposito, a Chicago bootlegger and restaurant owner. After Ricca arrived in New York, Esposito brought him to Chicago. Esposito put Ricca to work smuggling whiskey from Cuba and moonshine liquor from Kentucky to Chicago. Sensing Ricca's potential, Esposito appointed him as maitre d' at the Bella Napoli, Esposito's Chicago restaurant, earning the nickname \\"the Waiter\\". The Bella Napoli was popular with many Chicago gangsters, including the leader of the South Side Gang (the precursor to the Chicago Outfit), Al Capone. Sharing several mutual friends among Neapolitan gangsters who had returned to Italy, Ricca soon gave up his restaurant job and joined the South Side Gang. Working with Capone and Nitti Ricca rose very quickly in the gang ranks, frequently serving as Capone's emissary to the East Coast gangs. The two soon became good friends; in 1927, Capone served as the best man at Ricca's wedding. In 1929, Capone and Ricca attended the Atlantic City Conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the first meeting of all the major criminal gangs in the United States. In 1930, Capone sent Ricca to New York City to serve as his emissary in peace talks aimed at ending the Castellammarese War between the New York Italian-American gangs. With the establishment of the National Crime Syndicate in 1931, Ricca's prestige and visibility continued to rise. In 1931, Capone was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Capone's nominal successor was Frank \\"the Enforcer\\" Nitti, with Ricca as front boss. However, according to crime historian Carl Sifakis, Ricca held the actual power in the Outfit. Ricca frequently overruled Nitti's orders by saying, \\"We'll do it this way. Now let's hear no more about it!\\". In addition, the leaders of the emerging Syndicate, including Lucky Luciano, dealt only with Ricca, not Nitti. Hollywood extortion case In the early 1940s, Nitti convinced Ricca and the rest of the Outfit leadership to participate in a labor racketeering and extortion scheme aimed at the movie studios in Los Angeles, California. Chicago mobster John \\"Handsome Johnny\\" Roselli gained control of the Projectors Union and threatened the studios with strikes and other labor problems. To avoid labor unrest, RKO, Paramount, MGM and 20th Century Fox paid several hundred thousand dollars to the Outfit. However, two Outfit men were arrested for extortion and agreed to testify against the Outfit leadership. In March 1943, Ricca, Nitti, and other mob leaders were indicted for extortion. On March 18, 1943, Ricca and the Outfit leadership met with Nitti. Since the movie studio racket was Nitti's idea, Ricca and the Outfit leaders demanded that Nitti plead guilty to extortion charges to save them from prison. Terrified at the prospect of prison due to his severe claustrophobia, Nitti shot himself to death the next day. Ricca now became the official boss of the Outfit with enforcement chief Tony Accardo as underboss. Ricca and Accardo would run the Outfit for the next 30 years. Ricca was fairly soft-spoken, but was as ruthless as any crime boss. Whenever he wanted someone rubbed out, he said, \\"Make-a him go away.\\" Crime historian Joe Sifakis described him as one of the most stereotypical gangsters ever produced by the Chicago Outfit. Extortion conviction On December 30, 1943 Ricca and his associates were convicted of extortion and sentenced to ten years each in federal prison. Ricca began his sentence at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, but was soon lobbying to a transfer to Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas. The Atlanta warden, reportedly prejudiced against Italians, had severely beaten Outfit mobster Phil D'Andrea, making Ricca and the others fearful for their lives. After a series of contacts, St. Louis, Missouri lawyer Paul Dillon allegedly offered the head of the federal parole board payment to approve a transfer to Leavenworth for the Outfit mobster. In May, 1945, against the recommendations of both wardens, Ricca and the other mobsters were moved to Leavenworth. During this period, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accepted a cash settlement from Ricca for back taxes. On August 13, 1947, after a one-week deliberation, the parole board released Ricca and his co-defendants from prison on parole. However, as a condition of his parole, Ricca could have no contact with mobsters. Accardo replaced Ricca as boss. It was generally acknowledged, though, that Accardo shared power with Ricca, who stayed in the background as a senior consultant. No major transactions, and certainly no hits, took place without Ricca's knowledge. It was one of the few known instances of a power-sharing arrangement in organized crime. Ricca and Giancana As the 1950s began, Ricca started passing more of the day-to-day operation of the Outfit to Accardo. However, in 1957 Ricca suddenly told Accardo that he wanted Sam Giancana, a Ricca prot√©g√©, to take Accardo's position. Accardo was facing tax evasion charges and Ricca allegedly wanted him to disappear from public view. Although unhappy about the demotion, Accardo accepted it, joining Ricca in semi-retirement. However, it was understood that Giancana had to get Accardo and Ricca's approval for all major transactions, particularly hits. By staying in the background, Ricca and Accardo avoided further imprisonment far longer than Capone had. As Ricca aged, Accardo began to make more of the high level decisions, ultimately pushing Giancana out in favor of Sam Battaglia in 1966. Later years In 1957, the Federal government of the United States charged Ricca with illegally entering the United States under the alias Paul Maglio, and his citizenship was revoked. Three years earlier, the government had located the real Paul Maglio in Chicago and now brought him to testify against Ricca. Although the government won a deportation order, it was later overturned. In 1959, Ricca was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to nine years in federal prison. After serving 27 months of his sentence, Ricca was released. In 1965, Ricca was again indicted for tax evasion. In court, Ricca maintained that his total income for 1963, $80,159, was earned at the race track. Ricca was eventually acquitted. Ricca died of a heart attack on October 11, 1972 at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago. He is buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

Phylogenetic analysis of fossil bone samples revealed that it was highly distinct and genetically isolated from the modern lion (Panthera leo) occurring in Africa and Asia. Analysis of morphological differences and mitochondrial data support the taxonomic recognition of Panthera spelaea as a distinct species that diverged from the lion about 1.9 million years ago. Nuclear genomic evidence suggests a more recent split approximately 500,000 years ago, with no subsequent interbreeding with the ancestors of the modern lion. The oldest known bone fragments were excavated in Yakutia and radiocarbon dated at least 62,400 years old. It became extinct about 13,000 years ago. Taxonomy Cave lion skull exhibited in the Mus√©um de Toulouse Felis spelaea was the scientific name used by the German paleontologist Georg August Goldfuss in 1810 for a fossil lion skull that was excavated in a cave in southern Germany. It possibly dates to the W√ºrm glaciation. Several authors regarded Panthera spelaea as a subspecies of the modern lion and therefore Panthera leo spelaea. One author considered the cave lion to be more closely related to the tiger based on a comparison of skull shapes, and proposed the scientific name Panthera tigris spelaea. Results from morphological studies indicate that it is distinct in cranial and dental anatomy to justify specific status of Panthera spelaea. Results of phylogenetic studies also support this assessment. In 2001, the subspecies P. spelaea vereshchagini was proposed for seven specimens found in Siberia and Yukon, which have smaller skulls and teeth than average member of P. spelaea. Genetic analysis using ancient DNA provided no evidence for their distinct subspecific status; DNA signatures from P. spelaea from Europe and Alaska were indistinguishable, suggesting one large panmictic population. Analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences from 31 cave lions showed that they fall into two monophyletic clades. One lived across western Europe and the other was restricted to Beringia during the Pleistocene. =Evolution= Lions and bison depicted in the Chauvet Cave, France Lion-like pantherine felids first appeared in the Tanzanian Olduvai Gorge about . These cats dispersed to Europe from East Africa in the first half of the Middle Pleistocene, gving rise to P. fossilis in Central Europe by 610,000 years ago. Panthera spelaea evolved from P. fossilis about 460,000 years ago in central Europe during the late Saalian glaciation or early Eemian and would have been common throughout Eurasia from 450,000-14,000 years ago. Recent nuclear genomic evidence suggest that interbreeding between modern lions and all Eurasian fossil lions took place up until 500,000 years ago, but by 470,000 years ago, no subsequent interbreeding between the two lineages occurred. P. spelaea bone fragments excavated in Poland were radiocarbon dated to between the early and late Weichselian glaciation, and are between 109,000 and 57,000 years old. In Eurasia, it became extinct between 14,900 and 14,100 years ago, and survived in Beringia until 13,800 to 13,300 years ago as the Weichselian glaciation receded. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from fossil lion remains show that the American lion represents a sister group of P. spelaea, and likely arose when an early P. spelaea population became isolated south of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet about 340,000 years ago. The following cladogram shows the genetic relationship between P. spelaea and other pantherine cats. Characteristics Skeletal diagram Cave lions, Chamber of Felines, Lascaux caves P. spelaea is known from Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay figurines. These archaeological artifacts indicate that it may have been featured in Paleolithic religious rituals. A drawing in France's Chauvet cave, estimated to be 30,000 years old, depicts two cave lions walking together. The one in the foreground is slightly smaller than the one in the background, which has been drawn with a scrotum and without a mane. Such cave paintings suggest that male cave lions completely lacked manes, or at most had very small manes. P. spelaea was thought to have been one of the largest lion species. The skeleton of an adult male found in 1985 near Siegsdorf in Germany had a shoulder height of around and a head-body length of without the tail, similar in size to large modern lions. The size of this male was exceeded by other specimens, with another male reaching long without the tail. Similarly, footprints attributed to a male cave lion measured across. The heaviest Panthera spelaea was estimated to weigh . This shows that P. spelaea would have been up to or over 12% larger than modern lions, but still smaller than the earlier Panthera fossilis or the American lion (P. atrox). Cave paintings almost exclusively show hunting animals without a mane, suggesting that males were indeed maneless. P. spelaea had a relatively longer and narrower muzzle compared to that of the extant lion. Despite this, the two species do not exhibit major differences in morphology. Like modern lions, females were smaller than males. In 2016, hair found near the Maly Anyuy River was identified as cave lion hair through DNA analysis. Comparison with hair of a modern lion revealed that cave lion hair was probably similar in colour as that of the modern lion, though slightly lighter. In addition, the cave lion is thought to have had a very thick and dense undercoat comprising closed and compressed yellowish-to-white wavy downy hair with a smaller mass of darker- coloured guard hairs, possibly an adaptation to the Ice Age climate. Distribution and habitat Cave lions and other Ice Age fauna in northern Spain, by Mauricio Ant√≥n P. spelaea formed a contiguous population from Europe to Alaska over the Bering land bridge, across the range of the mammoth steppe. It was widely distributed from the Iberian peninsula, Southeast Europe, Great Britain, Central Europe, the East European Plain, and across most of northern Eurasia into Canada and Alaska. The oldest known fossils were excavated in northeastern Yakutia and were radiocarbon dated at 62,400 years old. The youngest known fossils are dated 11,925 years old and originated near Fairbanks, Alaska. Phalanx bones excavated in Spain's La Garma cave complex were radiocarbon dated to 14,300‚Äì14,000 years old. In Slovakia, skull, femur and pelvis remains were excavated in ten Karst caves in hilly and montane areas at elevations from . In Yakutia's Khayrgas Cave, bones of P. spelaea were found together with remains of humans, wolf, reindeer, Pleistocene horse and fish in a layer dated 13,200‚Äì21,500 years old. In 2008, a well-preserved mature cave lion specimen was unearthed near the Maly Anyuy River in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in Russia, which still retained some clumps of hair. The cave lion was probably predominantly found in open habitits such as steppe and grasslands although it would have also have occurred in open woodlands as well. =Discoveries= In 2015, two frozen cave lion cubs, estimated to be between 25,000 and 55,000 years old, were discovered close to the Uyandina River in Yakutia, Siberia in permafrost. Research results indicate that the cubs were likely barely a week old at the time of their deaths, as their milk teeth had not fully erupted. Further evidence suggests the cubs were hidden at a den site until they were strong enough to follow their mother back to the pride, as with modern lions. Researchers believe that the cubs were trapped and killed by a landslide, and that the absence of oxygen underground hindered their decomposition and allowed the cubs to be preserved in such good condition. A second expedition to the site where the cubs were found was planned for 2016, in hopes of finding either the remains of a third cub or possibly the cubs' mother. In 2017, another frozen specimen, thought to be a lion cub, was found in Yakutia on the banks of the Tirekhtyakh River (), a tributary of the Indigirka River. Named 'Boris', this cat was believed to be slightly older than the 2015 cubs at the time of its death; it is estimated to have been around one and a half to two months. In 2018, another preserved carcass of a cub was found in a location away. Named 'Spartak', it was considered to be around a month old when it died approximately 50,000 years ago, and presumed to be a sibling to Boris. Paleobiology Cave lion with a reindeer, painting by Heinrich Harder P. spelaea inhabited open environment such as mammoth steppe and boreal forest. It was one of the keystone species of the mammoth steppe, being one of the main apex predators alongside grey wolf, cave hyena and brown bear. Large amounts of bones belonging to P. spelaea were excavated in caves, where bones of cave hyena, cave bear and Paleolithic artefacts were also found. It is unclear whether P. spelaea was social like the modern lion; some evidence indicates that it may have been solitary. Isotopic analyses of bone collagen samples extracted from fossils indicate that cave bear cubs, reindeer and other cervids were prominent in the diet of cave lions. Later cave lions seem to have preyed foremost on reindeer, up to the brink of local extinction or extirpation of both species.Other possible prey species were giant deer, red deer, wild horse, musk ox, bison, young woolly rhino and young woolly mammoth. It likely competed for prey with the European Ice Age leopard (P. pardus spelaea) as well as cave hyenas, cave bears and wolves. An Isotope analysis study suggested most sampled P. spelea specimens were primarily consuming reindeer.

North of Brampton, the freeway connects to Highway 10, which continues north through Caledon as a four-lane undivided highway. The route is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police and has a speed limit of . Highway 410 was built along the alignment of Heart Lake Road south of Bovaird Drive, while north of Bovaird Drive it was built along a new alignment. The highway was designated in 1978 between Highway 401 and Bovaird Drive (later Highway 7), though it was only two lanes wide and had at-grade intersections. It was widened throughout the 1980s and completed as a freeway in 1991. In 2003, construction began on a northward extension of the freeway that was completed in November 2009. A notable feature of Highway 410 is the four-level interchange with Highways 401 and 403 which includes an 11-span flyover ramp from Highway 401 eastbound to Highway 410 northbound which was completed in 1993.  Route description  Highway 410 is a commuter freeway acting as the southward continuation of Highway 10, which formerly ran alongside the 410 and continued south through Brampton and Mississauga prior to the two highways being connected in 2009. Highway 410 starts at a massive stack interchange with Highway 401 and Highway 403. Highway 403's eastern segment which runs from the south and west through central Mississauga splits up into a collector-express system at Eglinton Avenue, and while the express lanes continue directly to Highway 401 express lanes east of the 401-403-410 interchange, just north of the Matheson Boulevard overpasses the collector lanes effectively continue northward as Highway 410 after exit/entry ramps linking to Highway 401 collector lanes. The 410 interchange with Courtneypark Drive, prior to the reconfiguration of the ramp exiting the freeway, also showing the freeway's grass median prior to expansion Maintaining a straight north-westward course, it passes beneath Courtney Park Drive and Derry Road, with a slight jog to the right between the two underpasses. The freeway then meets Highway 407 at a cloverstack interchange as it crosses into Brampton and passes beneath a hydro corridor. Veering to the left, the freeway continues through industrialized areas and returns to its northwest-southeast orientation. It passes beneath Steeles Avenue East, following alongside the alignment of Heart Lake Road (now mostly broken up into segments), and later Queen Street East, the former Highway 7, now Peel Regional Road 107. Until it was decommissioned across the Greater Toronto Area, Highway 7 was concurrent between Queen Street East and Bovaird Drive. Passing north of Queen Street, the highway leaves the industrial area and passes through residential areas in an open cut until Bovaird Drive East. The more recently completed extension begins at this point, as the highway returns to ground level and passes to the west of Trinity Common and departs from the Heart Lake Road alignment passing near the Heart Lake Conservation Area. As it passes beneath Mayfield Road, the highway makes a sharp turn to the west and descends through the Etobicoke Creek valley. After rising back to level ground, it curves north, passing beneath Valleywood Drive. The central concrete median and high-mast lighting end as the freeway becomes Highway 10, which continues north to Orangeville, Shelburne and eventually Owen Sound.  History  Planning for highway 410 began during the late 1960s as a result of the rapid suburbanization of Brampton. On May 25, 1965, the Department of Highways (DHO) unveiled the Toronto Region Western Section Highway Planning Study. The plan designated several new highway corridors and widening projects through Peel and Halton, including Highway 10. However, it did not include a truck bypass that was desired by Brampton city council. In 1969, William H. Brydon would encourage the DHO to construct this bypass utilizing Heart Lake Road through the city, and announced the plans at his final city council meeting as mayor, claiming that it may be known as the Brampton Expressway and would connect with Highway 401. Successor Jim Archdekin announced in the new year that he would meet with highways minister George Gomme to discuss the route of the bypass. The DHO studied the corridor over the next several months before releasing a report in late August. Ontario Premier Bill Davis, who was known as \\"Brampton Billy\\", formally initiated the construction of Highway 410 along the Heart Lake Road corridor during his administration. Prior to the construction of Highway 410, Heart Lake Road was flanked by the industrial lands of Brampton and Bramalea north of Steeles Avenue, which required the highway to follow the road's alignment to avoid demolition of buildings. Between Steeles and Highway 401 was agricultural lands, allowing for the highway to constructed on a separate alignment to the west. In 1975, construction began on the widening of Highway 401 between Highway 10 (Hurontario Street) and Highway 427. During this expansion from four to six lanes, directional ramps were constructed with the new road to allow access to and from Toronto. Heart Lake Road though Brampton was rebuilt over the next several years, and reopened as a two lane expressway on November 15, 1978. It was at this point that the road was designated Highway 410 as far north as Queen Street. The construction of Highway 410 resulted in changes to the surrounding street network: The intact southern section of Heart Lake Road south of Steeles Avenue was severed from the northern section after the highway largely subsumed the latter. This portion was renamed Tomken Road (as a continuation of a street linked to its southern terminus when a jog was eliminated), and a diversion was constructed by the City of Brampton to connect it with Steeles further east. The West Drive Extension, between Orenda Road and Steeles, was constructed in 1983 to link with the north end of the new diversion. Construction to twin the highway began in 1983, following the completion of a culvert over the east branch of the Etobicoke Creek; the interchange with Clark Boulevard was built at the same time. The following year, contracts were awarded to build the two structures over the Canadian National Railway south of Orenda Road, as well as an interchange at Queen Street; the former was completed by the end of the year while the latter took until late 1985. Construction of the interchange at Bovaird Drive began in 1985 and was completed the following summer. With the construction of each interchange, the future northbound lanes of the freeway were constructed and opened to two-way traffic. By 1988, two lanes were open between Steeles Avenue and Bovaird Drive. In 1987, construction began south of the future Highway 407 interchange, expanding the two lane Heart Lake Road to a six lane freeway. In addition, work began on the future southbound lanes north of Steeles Avenue. In 1990, work began on an interchange with Courtney Park Drive. By mid-1991, Highway 410 was complete from north of Highway 401 to Bovaird Drive, and work was underway on two large flyover ramps. The interchange with Highway 401 was rebuilt alongside the widening of that highway to a collector-express system and opened to traffic ramp-by-ramp beginning August 28, 1990 and continuing through the end of the year. In the fall of 1991, alongside the widening of Highway 410 into a full freeway, construction began on the connecting ramps between Highway 403 and Highway 410, which pass under the existing bridge structures for Highway 401 collector traffic, while new overpasses were constructed for the Highway 401 express lanes. The link opened on November 2, 1992, at a cost of $7.3 million. = Extension = The new 410 extension crossing Etobicoke Creek. Note the placeholders for high-mast lighting on the median. The extension beyond Bovaird Drive to Hurontario was conceived as part of the ultimate plan for Highway 410 when it was under construction in 1982. It would take until 2003 for construction to begin. Planning for the freeway began with the submitting of an Environmental Assessment by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) in October 1995. The assessment was approved without a hearing by the Minister of Environment and Energy on March 5, 1997. The next several years were spent on engineering and design. The new section, planned and built as a four lane freeway, was constructed on a new alignment in order to bypass the Heart Lake Conservation Area. It was completed in phases: initially to the new eastward extension of Sandalwood Parkway, later to Mayfield Road and finally to Highway 10 north of Sandalwood. Premier of Ontario Ernie Eves officially announced the extension on June 23, 2003; construction subsequently began on the first phase. On May 15, 2006 construction began on the second phase between Sandalwood Parkway and Mayfield Drive. The first two phases were built by Dufferin Construction and opened together in mid‚Äìlate 2007; the northbound lanes were opened by the beginning of September and the southbound lanes by the end of the month. Upon its opening, trucks were prohibited from driving along it due to concerns of them travelling on the two lane Mayfield Road; this ban has since been lifted. Construction on the third phase between Mayfield Road and Highway 10 began in August 2007. The entire extension was completed and opened to traffic on November 16, 2009. Additional work continued in the months that followed to clean up the land surrounding the new freeway. = Recent Work = On September 9, 2014, the MTO announced that Highway 410 would be widened to ten lanes from south of Highway 401 to Queen Street in Brampton by 2018. A C$156.7 million contract was awarded to Aecon Construction to expand the freeway by adding one general purpose and one High- occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction. In addition, two new ramps will be built at the partial interchange with Highway 401 and Highway 403, a directional ramp from Highway 401 eastbound to Highway 403 southbound and a loop ramp from Highway 403 northbound to Highway 403 westbound, thereby providing access to and from all directions. One new lane in each direction was opened in late 2017: a northbound lane between Courtney Park and south of Queen Street on October 31, and a southbound lane between Queen Street and Highway 401 on November 28. In November 2018, both the southbound and northbound HOV Lane opened through the route. The southbound HOV was opened several weeks ahead of the northbound HOV lane.

It is well-known for the Bala Falls, the source of the Moon River, where that river drains Lake Muskoka. It is considered one of the hubs of cottage country located north of Toronto. Thus, its year-round population of several hundred is increased by thousands of seasonal residents and weekend day-trippers during summer months. It is known as the Cranberry Capital of Ontario, as the province's largest cranberry farms, Johnston's Cranberry Marsh and Former: Wahta Iroquis Growers (closed in 2017), are located nearby. It was once the smallest incorporated town in Canada until it was amalgamated into Muskoka Lakes Township. History Bala was settled by Thomas Burgess in 1868. Thomas Burgess opened a sawmill and store to serve the area's scattered settlers. Thomas Burgess named it after the town of Bala in Wales with which it is officially twinned. Located on the Canadian Shield, it proved unsuitable for farming, and its fortunes declined as logging became less economically viable. Railway connections helped to re-establish the village as a popular location for summer resorts. In 1914, the town incorporated with Burgess's son as the first mayor, making it the smallest incorporated town in Canada. Geography South Falls Located at the west end of Lake Muskoka, at the foot of Bala Bay, the prominent geographical feature of the town are the many bare outcroppings of the Canadian Shield. Carved out of the Shield is Bala Falls, the only outlet for Lake Muskoka. That allows water to empty from the Muskoka River watershed into the Moon River and eventually Georgian Bay; however, the falls were at a low elevation and for many years the water levels of Lake Muskoka were known to fluctuate eight or nine feet every season, between the spring runoffs and the late fall. That led to many navigation problems both for the timber industry and the settlers. In 1873, a control dam was built at the Bala Falls, which still exists in an upgraded form and is known as the North Falls. However, the dam worked too well and led to flooding, which forced the construction soon after of a large flood control dam and channel, known today as the South Falls. A further channel north of the North Falls was created in the 1880s to power a sawmill and later reused as the water intake channel for a hydroelectric station built in 1917. The station, operated by the Bala Electric Light and Power Company to supply electricity as far as MacTier and Port Carling was retired in 1957 but then returned to active use as a small remotely-operated station in the 1990s. It remains in use today. A second station operated between the North and South Falls from 1924 to 1957 but was later demolished because it was uneconomical. A new generating station is being built at the site, a project that caused much local controversy. Transportation CPR station circa 1910 Bala was well connected and once was connected only to other Muskoka communities via the steamship lines that plied the Muskoka Lakes. The Cherokee, Islander and Segwun were frequently seen at the dock below the CPR station, and the Ahmic was based on the other side of Bala Bay in Torrance. Steamships have been unable to visit Bala since 1964, when the swing bridge at Bala Park Island was sealed shut. A portion of the former steamer dock remains, maintained for many decades by the MNR and today by the Township of Muskoka Lakes. In 1907 the Canadian Pacific Railway opened a prominent \\"summer\\" station at the harbour, complete with freight elevator (a \\"winter\\" station was located a half-mile north). There was also a seasonal Grand Trunk Railway (later CN) station across the bay on Bala Park Island. In 1927, six CPR train routes each way served Bala, four on a daily basis. With the influx of many American cottagers, Bala even became a Customs Port of Entry. The Bala Weekend trains continued to serve the tourists until 1963, when the station was demolished. The settlement-era Musquosh Road from Gravenhurst arrived in the 1880s and fed further development after the heyday of the railways as the route was eventually upgraded from a rough trail into first the Rama Road, then the provincial Highway 69 (later renumbered to Highway 169, then to Muskoka Road 169). A postwar bypass was created for the highway to avoid the original Musquosh Road bridge and single-lane rail underpass at the South Falls, but that also had the effect of removing traffic from Bala's former main street south of the Falls, severely impacting businesses on that section and concentrating commercial activity along the highway north of the Falls. Services In 1971, the town was amalgamated with other townships and municipalities to form the Township of Muskoka Lakes; the Chamber of Commerce office is in Bala; other civic functions are located in Port Carling. Bala was the location of the first detachment of Ontario Provincial Police in 1921. A small modern station remains just north of the main part of town (run by the Bracebridge detachment part-time). The Canada Post Post Office has been relocated to share space with the police station. Accommodations Until changes in transportation and development led to most seasonal visitors staying in private cottages, Bala offered summer lodging at a large number of tourist resorts over the decades. For example, Windsor Park is on the site of the former Windsor Hotel. Located on River Street were Bala Cozy Cabins and Roselawn Lodge. The Bala Bay Inn (formerly the Swastika Inn until a postwar name change) remained as an active hotel until 2016. Built in 1910, it is Muskoka's oldest brick hotel. The original tin ceiling and mahogany staircase still grace the front lobby. Culture and entertainment Bridge over the South Falls Since 1942, under various management and names, the community and the surrounding area was offered live musical entertainment. In the 1940s and '50s, Big Bands like Mart Kenney, Cab Calloway, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Woody Herman and Louis Armstrong played at Dunn's Pavilion. Since the 1960s, rock musicians like David Wilcox, Kim Mitchell, The Ramones, April Wine, Burton Cummings and Jeff Healey played at The KEE to Bala. More recently, bands such as Sum 41, The Tragically Hip, The Sam Roberts Band, Hinder, Finger Eleven, Three Days Grace, Sloan, Tim Hicks, Hedley and Theory of a Deadman have graced the stage at The KEE to Bala. In the 1980s, Bala and Port Carling were also featured in a skit by The Frantics on Boot to the Head. In the skit, a man on his way to Bala bores his companion to distraction in part by endlessly enumerating the communities' features. Most recently Bala is home to The New Actor's Colony professional Theatre company who perform seasonally in the summer in the local curling rink. Lucy Maud Montgomery, author of the Anne of Green Gables books, visited Bala in 1922. The area made a sufficient impression on her that she based the novel The Blue Castle on the area, her only novel not set in Prince Edward Island. Based on the connection to a beloved Canadian author, Bala's Museum, a privately run museum featuring Montgomery, was opened in the 1990s. Bala hosts the Bala Cranberry Festival annually on the weekend after Canadian Thanksgiving, attracting thousands of people to the town.Cranberry fields forever, Annual Bala festival proves the berries aren't just for turkey dinners anymore, Katherine Elphick, The Toronto Star. Retrieved October 9, 2010. Bala is home to Muskoka Lakes Winery, the Muskoka region's only winery, which specializes in cranberry and other fruit wines. Once a week in the summer months, students from a nearby water ski school perform aquatic stunts for audiences at a local park. Students form pyramids, jump obstacles, ski barefoot, and occasionally ski while they wearalpine skis. Bala Bay remains a sailing hotspot in Muskoka due to its excellent and consistent winds. A local sailing club organizes Saturday races.

Georgia Edwards), and Richard Lewis Morris (who married Anne Elizabeth Dunwoodie). In 1822, when Charles was just two years old, his mother and older brother Lewis were killed during a hurricane on Sullivan's Island. In 1837, his father remarried to Amarinthia Lowndes, a daughter of James Lowndes and granddaughter of Gov. Rawlins Lowndes. From his father's second marriage, he had three half- siblings, including Lewis Morris (b. 1842), who lived in Paris. Although they lived in the South, his father maintained control of Morris family property around Morrisania in New York. His paternal grandparents were Maj. and Brevet Lt. Col. of the Continental Army Lewis V. Morris (eldest son of Continental Congressman and signer of the Declaration of Independence Lewis Morris who was the third and last Lord of Morrisania Manor) and Ann B. (n√©e Elliott) Morris (a sister-in-law of U.S. Representative Daniel Huger). His maternal grandparents were architect Gabriel Manigault (a son of Peter Manigault, the wealthiest person in British North America in 1770) and Margaret (n√©e Izard) Manigault (a daughter of Continental Congressman and U.S. Senator from South Carolina Ralph Izard). He was also distant cousin of Confederate General Arthur Middleton Manigault, and a great-nephew of Arthur Middleton. Career CSS Florida. In December 1837, he entered the United States Navy as a midshipman. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1851, serving \\"with honor during the Mexican War.\\" In 1853, he was Lieutenant on the USS Mississippi with Commodore Matthew C. Perry's expedition to Japan. While in Japan, Morris received gifts from Emperor K≈çmei. In 1860, he was First Lt. of the USS Marion with the Africa Squadron off the coast of Africa. He resigned his commission on January 29, 1861, following South Carolina's secession and was ordered to the command of the CSS Huntress, side-wheel steamer, in Savannah. In March, he was appointed a First Lieutenant in the Confederate States Navy. From 1861 to 1863, Morris served on the Savannah, Georgia Station where he married his second wife. After John Newland Maffitt became ill at Brest, France, Morris took over in January 1864 as commander of the CSS Florida. As commander, he captured Electric Spark, Harriet Stevens, Golconda, Margaret Y. Davis, and USS Mondamin along the coast of the United States. Morris then crossed the ocean to Tenerife in the Canary Islands before cruising back to Brazil capturing the B.X. Hoxie, Cairaissanne, David Lapsey, USS Estella, George Latimer, Southern Rights, Greenland, Windward, William C. Clark, and Zelinda. In October 1864, however, his ship was illegally captured in a Brazilian harbor by the Union Navy. Morris and most of his crew were ashore when his ship was boarded in the middle of the night while at anchor in neutral waters. During the remainder of the American Civil War, he served abroad as an agent of the Confederate States government.First Lieutenant Charles Manigault Morris, CSN at the U.S. Naval Historical Center =Later life= Following the war, Morris and his family settled in England. After the War, his wife took an interest in the education of President Jefferson Davis' daughter, Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Davis at the convent in France.

In the 18th century, the town was well known for the manufacture of flannel, stockings, gloves and hosiery. The large stone-built theological college, Coleg Y Bala, of the Calvinistic Methodists and the grammar school, which was founded in 1712, are the chief features, together with the statue of the Rev. Thomas Charles (1755‚Äì1814), the theological writer, to whom was largely due the foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society. In 1800 a 15-year-old girl, Mary Jones, walked the from her home village Llanfihangel-y-Pennant to purchase a Welsh bible in Bala. The scarcity of the Bible, along with the determination of Mary to get one (she had saved for six years), was a major factor in the foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804. Betsi Cadwaladr, who worked with Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, and who gave her name to the Health Board, came from Bala. Other famous people from the Bala area include Michael D.

The 2009 Eisteddfod was notable because the chair was not awarded to any of the entrants as the standard was deemed to be too low. Bala hosted the Eisteddfod Genedlaethol yr Urdd Gobaith Cymru, National Eisteddfod for the Welsh League of Youth, in 2014.

Twinning Bala, Ontario, Canada, was named after the town in 1868. They have become twin towns. Geography Set within the Bala Fault, Bala Lake () is the largest natural lake in Wales at in length and 800 m wide. At 35 metres, its depths could hide the tower of St Giles Church in Wrexham and still have 1 metre of water above. The lake has occasionally been known to freeze over, most recently in the severe winters of 1947 and 1963. The rare Gwyniad fish--trapped in the lake at the end of the last Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago--is in danger because its natural home is increasingly unsuitable.Freyhof, J. & Kottelat, M. 2008.

The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self- possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice. Angelou was challenged by her friend author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, to write an autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize Caged Bird as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women in the years following the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition. Angelou uses her autobiography to explore subjects such as identity, rape, racism, and literacy. She also writes in new ways about women's lives in a male-dominated society. Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book's central character, has been called \\"a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America\\".Tate, p. 150 Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text. Another metaphor, that of a bird struggling to escape its cage, is a central image throughout the work, which consists of \\"a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression\\".Walker, p. 19 Angelou's treatment of racism provides a thematic unity to the book. Literacy and the power of words help young Maya cope with her bewildering world; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma. Caged Bird was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on The New York Times paperback bestseller list for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries. Background The book's title comes from a poem by African- American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. The caged bird, a symbol for the chained slave, is an image Angelou uses throughout all her writings.Lupton, p. 66. Before writing I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings at the age of forty, Angelou had a long and varied career, holding jobs such as composer, singer, actor, civil rights worker, journalist, and educator. In the late 1950s, she joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met a number of important African-American authors, including her friend and mentor James Baldwin. After hearing civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. speak for the first time in 1960, she was inspired to join the Civil Rights Movement. She organized several benefits for him, and he named her Northern Coordinator of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She worked for several years in Ghana, West Africa, as a journalist, actress, and educator. She was invited back to the US by Malcolm X to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965.Gillespie et al, p. 81 In 1968, King asked her to organize a march, but he too was assassinated on April 4, which also happened to be her birthday. For many years, Angelou responded to King's murder by not celebrating her birthday, instead choosing to meet with, call, or send flowers to his widow, Coretta Scott King. Angelou was deeply depressed in the months following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968. The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day she called Robert Loomis at Random House, who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and \\"told him that he ought to get this woman to write a book\\". At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright.Walker, p. 17 According to Angelou, Baldwin had a \\"covert hand\\" in getting her to write the book, and advised Loomis to use \\"a little reverse psychology\\", and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her: \\"It's just as well\\", he said, \\"because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible\\". Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing Caged Bird. After \\"closeting herself\\"Hagen, p. 57 in London, it took her two years to write it. She shared the manuscript with her friend, writer Jessica Mitford, before submitting it for publication. Angelou subsequently wrote six additional autobiographies, covering a variety of her young adult experiences. They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes and stretch from Arkansas to Africa, and back to the US, from the beginnings of World War II to King's assassination.Lupton, p. 1 Like Caged Bird, the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology. Later books in the series include Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (1976), The Heart of a Woman (1981), All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and Mom & Me & Mom (2013, at the age of 85). Critics have often judged Angelou's later autobiographies \\"in light of the first\\", and Caged Bird generally receives the highest praise. Beginning with Caged Bird, Angelou used the same \\"writing ritual\\" for many years.Lupton, p. 15 She would get up at five in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff were instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. She averaged 10‚Äì12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. Lupton stated that this ritual indicated \\"a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time\\". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to \\"enchant\\" herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to \\"relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang\\". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to \\"tell the human truth\\" about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about Caged Bird: \\"...Though easily read, [it] is no 'easy read'\\".Moore, p. 55. Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, \\"It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it‚Äîha! It's so delicious!\\" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in \\"telling the truth\\". =Title= When selecting a title, Angelou turned to Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet whose works she had admired for years. Jazz vocalist and civil rights activist Abbey Lincoln suggested the title.Hagen, p. 54. According to Lyman B. Hagen, the title pulls Angelou's readers into the book while reminding them that it is possible to both lose control of one's life and to have one's freedom taken from them.Hagen, pp. 54‚Äì55. Angelou has credited Dunbar, along with Shakespeare, with forming her \\"writing ambition\\".Tate, p. 158 The title of the book comes from the third stanza of Dunbar's poem \\"Sympathy\\": > I know why the caged bird sings, ah me, > When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore, > When he beats his bars and would be free; > It is not a carol of joy or glee, > But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core, > But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings ‚Äì > I know why the caged bird sings. Plot summary I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings follows Marguerite's (called \\"My\\" or \\"Maya\\" by her brother) life from the age of three to seventeen and the struggles she faces ‚Äì particularly with racism ‚Äì in the Southern United States. Abandoned by their parents, Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother (Momma) and disabled uncle (Uncle Willie) in Stamps, Arkansas. Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents' abandonment throughout the book ‚Äì they travel alone and are labeled like baggage.Bloom, p. 19 The community of Stamps, Arkansas, is the setting for a large portion of the book. Many of the problems Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors. Although Momma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store at the heart of Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these \\"powhitetrash\\" girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of Joe Louis's championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression. A turning point in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey's father unexpectedly appears in Stamps. He takes the two children with him when he departs, but leaves them with their mother in St. Louis, Missouri. Eight-year-old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. He is found guilty during the trial, but escapes jail time and is murdered, presumably by Maya's uncles. Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother. Even after returning to Stamps, Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers, \\"the aristocrat of Black Stamps,\\"Angelou, p. 93 who encourages her through books and communication to regain her voice and soul. This coaxes Maya out of her shell. Later, Momma decides to send her grandchildren to their mother in San Francisco, California, to protect them from the dangers of racism in Stamps. Maya attends George Washington High School and studies dance and drama on a scholarship at the California Labor School. Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female cable car conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car for the first time when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend. During Maya's final year of high school, she worries that she might be a lesbian (which she confuses due to her sexual inexperience with the belief that lesbians are also hermaphrodites). She ultimately initiates sexual intercourse with a teenage boy. She becomes pregnant, which on the advice of her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school. Maya gives birth at the end of the book. Style and genre In addition to being classified as an autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings has also been called a Bildungsroman, like George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss. Angelou's prose works, while presenting a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form, can be placed in the long tradition of African-American autobiography.Hagen, pp. 6‚Äì7. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development, however, often lead reviewers to categorize her books, including I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, as autobiographical fiction.Lupton, pp. 29‚Äì30. Other critics, like Lupton, insist that Angelou's books should be categorized as autobiographies because they conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.Lupton, p. 32. In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic Claudia Tate, Angelou calls her books autobiographies.Tate, p. 153. At first, Angelou intended to return to poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and so that she could \\"change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century\\". In a 1989 interview, she stated, \\"I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression\\". As she told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, \\"Autobiography is awfully seductive; it‚Äôs wonderful\\". She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of \\"speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'\\". As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.Cudjoe, pp. 10‚Äì11. Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees Caged Bird as \\"the fully developed black female autobiographical form that began to emerge in the 1940s and 1950s\\". The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self- definition.Braxton (2004), p. 64 Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South, at some points a child, and other points a mother.Lupton, pp. 52‚Äì53. Writer Hilton Als calls Angelou one of the \\"pioneers of self-exposure\\", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, Angelou was worried about her readers' reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, that she was a prostitute. She went through with it, anyway, after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her to be honest about it.Lupton, p. 14. Angelou has recognized that there are fictional aspects to her books, and that she tends to \\"diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth\\".Lupton, p. 34 Angelou discussed her writing process with Plimpton, and when asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she admitted that she had. She stated, \\"Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about.\\" Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, \\"One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work\\".Hagen, p. 18 Hagen also states that Angelou \\"fictionalizes, to enhance interest\\". For example, Angelou uses the first-person narrative voice customary with autobiographies, told from the perspective of a child that is \\"artfully recreated by an adult narrator\\".Lupton, p. 52. Angelou uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls \\"the Maya character\\". Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and the Maya character is \\"damned difficult\\", but \\"very necessary\\". Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou \\"retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpless pain\\" by using her adult self's irony and wit.Arensberg, p. 114 As such, Caged Bird has been called a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story; critic Mary Jane Lupton compares it to other Bildungsromans like George Eliot's novel The Mill on the Floss. According to Lupton, the two books share the following similarities: a focus on young strong-willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers, an examination of the role of literature in life, and an emphasis on the importance of family and community life.Lupton, p. 30 Form When Angelou wrote I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature, according to critic Pierre A. Walker, was thematic unity. One of Angelou's goals was to create a book that satisfied this criterion, in order to achieve her political purposes, which were to demonstrate how to resist racism in America. The structure of the text, which resembles a series of short stories, is not chronological but rather thematic. Walker, in his 1993 article about Caged Bird, \\"Racial Protest, Identity, Words, and Form\\", focuses on the book's structure, and describes how it supports her presentation of racism. According to Walker, critics had neglected analyzing its structure, choosing to focus instead on its themes, which he feels neglects the political nature of the book. He states, \\"One serves Angelou and Caged Bird better by emphasizing how form and political content work together\\".Walker, p. 31. Angelou structures her book so that it presents a series of lessons about how to resist racism and oppression. The progression Maya goes through thematically unifies the book, something that \\"stands in contrast to the otherwise episodic quality of the narrative\\". The way in which Angelou constructs, arranges, and organizes her vignettes often undermined the chronology of her childhood by \\"juxtaposing the events of one chapter with the events of preceding and following ones so that they too comment on each other\\". For example, the incident with the \\"powhitetrash\\" girls takes place in chapter 5, when Maya was ten years old, well before Angelou's recounting of her rape in chapter 12, which occurred when Maya was 8. Walker explains that Angelou's purpose in placing the vignettes in this way is that it followed her thematic structure.Walker, p. 20 Angelou's editor, Robert Loomis, agrees, stating that Angelou could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader. Hagen sees Angelou's structure somewhat differently, focusing on Maya's journey \\"to establish a worthwhile self-concept\\",Hagen, p. 58. and states that she structures the book into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, which occur both geographically and psychologically. However, Hagen notes that instead of beginning Caged Bird chronologically, with Maya and Bailey's arrival in Stamps, Angelou begins the book much later chronologically by recounting an embarrassing experience at church, an incident that demonstrates Maya's diminished sense of self, insecurity, and lack of status. Hagen explains that Angelou's purpose is to demonstrate Maya's journey from insecurity to her feelings of worth gained by becoming a mother at the end of the book.Hagen, pp. 58‚Äì59. Themes =Identity= In the course of Caged Bird, Maya, who has been described as \\"a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America\\", goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity. Feminist scholar Maria Lauret states that the \\"formation of female cultural identity\\" is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as \\"a role model for Black women\\".Lauret, p. 97. Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's \\"identity theme\\" and a major motif in Angelou's narrative. Maya's unsettled life in Caged Bird suggests her sense of self \\"as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications\\".Arensberg, p. 115. African-American literature scholar Dolly McPherson agrees, stating that Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth. As Lauret indicates, Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Up until this time, Black women were not depicted realistically in African-American fiction and autobiography, meaning that Angelou was one of the first Black autobiographers to present, as Cudjoe put it, \\"a powerful and authentic signification of [African-American] womanhood in her quest for understanding and love rather than for bitterness and despair\\".Cudjoe, p. 11. Lauret sees a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret calls \\"fictions of subjectivity\\" and \\"feminist first-person narratives\\", and fictional first- person narratives (such as The Women's Room by Marilyn French and The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing) written during the same period. As French and Lessing do in their novels, Angelou employs the narrator as protagonist and depends upon \\"the illusion of presence in their mode of signification\\".Lauret, p. 98. As a displaced girl, Maya's pain is worsened by an awareness of her displacement. She is \\"the forgotten child\\", and must come to terms with \\"the unimaginable reality\\" of being unloved and unwanted;McPherson, p. 28. she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced ‚Äì her belief in her own ugliness was \\"absolute\\".McPherson, p. 25. McPherson believes that the concept of family, or what she calls \\"kinship concerns\\", in Angelou's books must be understood in the light of the children's displacement at the beginning of Caged Bird.McPherson, p. 15. Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.Smith, p. 52. Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in Caged Bird, Angelou demonstrates the \\"racist habit\\" of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her \\"Mary\\". Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the \\"hellish horror of being 'called out of [one's] name'\\".Angelou, p. 91. Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image.King, p. 189. The renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish, but feels vindicated when, as she leaves her employer's home, Mrs. Cullinan finally gets her name right.Smith, p. 53. Another incident in the book that solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally \\"in control of her fate\\".Smith, p. 54. This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth. Scholar Mary Burgher believes that female Black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African-American mothers as \\"breeder[s] and matriarch[s]\\", and have presented them as having \\"a creative and personally fulfilling role\\".Burgher, p. 115 Lupton believes that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother/child motif as is found in the work of Harlem Renaissance poet Jessie Fauset.Lupton, p. 49. For the first five years of her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother is dead. Maya's feelings for and relationship with her own mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and \\"repressed violent aggression\\".Arensberg, p. 118. For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent by their mother. These strong feelings are not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed.Arensberg, p. 126. The two main maternal influences on Maya's life change as well; Vivian becomes a more active participant, while Momma becomes less effective as Maya, by becoming a mother herself, moves from childhood to adulthood.Hagen, p. 59. =Racism= For several years before writing Caged Bird, Angelou worked with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during the 1960s to combat racism. Stamps, Arkansas, as depicted in Caged Bird, has very little \\"social ambiguity\\": it is a racist world divided between Black and white, male and female. Als characterizes the division as \\"good and evil\\", and notes how Angelou's witness of the evil in her society, which was directed at Black women, shaped Angelou's young life and informed her views into adulthood. Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage, described in Paul Laurence Dunbar's poem, as a prominent symbol throughout her series of autobiographies.Lupton, p. 38. Like elements within a prison narrative, the caged bird represents Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and oppression.Lupton, pp. 38‚Äì39. The caged bird metaphor also invokes the \\"supposed contradiction of the bird singing in the midst of its struggle\\". Scholar Ernece B. Kelley calls Caged Bird a \\"gentle indictment of white American womanhood\\";Hagen, p. 55. Hagen expands it further, stating that the book is \\"a dismaying story of white dominance\\". Caged Bird has been called \\"perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying autobiography written in the years immediately following the Civil Rights era\\".Braxton (1999), p. 4. Critic Pierre A. Walker expresses a similar sentiment, and places it in the African- American literature tradition of political protest. Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the Black community of Stamps, as well as her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters and \\"the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans\\",Lupton, p. 63. her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society. Angelou's autobiographies, beginning with Caged Bird, contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression. The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from \\"helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest\\". Walker insists that Angelou's treatment of racism is what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. For example, in Angelou's depiction of the \\"powhitetrash\\" incident, Maya reacts with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness, but Momma teaches her how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism, and that it is an effective basis for actively protesting and combating racism. Walker calls Momma's way a \\"strategy of subtle resistance\\"Walker, p. 22. and McPherson calls it \\"the dignified course of silent endurance\\".McPherson, p. 33 Angelou portrays Momma as a realist whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the survival and success of those who came after her.Hagen, p. 70. For example, Maya responds assertively when subjected to demeaning treatment by Mrs. Cullinan, her white employer, and, later on in the book, breaks the race barrier to become the first black streetcar operator in San Francisco.Walker, p. 26. In addition, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism.McPherson, p. 37. Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her \\"racial hatred\\",Arensberg, p. 116. common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers. At first Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up Black in white America is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity. =Rape= Angelou's description of being raped as an eight- year-old child overwhelms the autobiography, although it is presented briefly in the text.Lupton, p. 67 Scholar Mary Vermillion compares Angelou's treatment of rape to that of Harriet Jacobs in her autobiography Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Jacobs and Angelou both use rape as a metaphor for the suffering of African Americans; Jacobs uses the metaphor to critique slaveholding culture, while Angelou uses it to first internalize, then challenge, twentieth-century racist conceptions of the Black female body (namely, that the Black female is physically unattractive).Vermillion, p. 66. Rape, according to Vermillion, \\"represents the black girl's difficulties in controlling, understanding, and respecting both her body and her words\\".Vermillion, p. 67. Arensberg notes that Maya's rape is connected to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape was the first time he touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence.Vermillion, p. 73. As Angelou later stated, \\"I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk\\". African-American literature scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's depiction of the rape \\"a burden\\" of Caged Bird: a demonstration of \\"the manner in which the Black female is violated in her tender years and ... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence\\".Cudjoe, p. 12 Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender.Vermillion, pp. 60‚Äì61. When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, \\"I can't remember a time when I wasn't loved by somebody.\\"Braxton, p. 11. When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape. She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.Braxton, p. 12. =Literacy= Angelou has described William Shakespeare as a strong influence on her life and works, especially his identification with what she saw as marginalized people, claiming that \\"Shakespeare was a black woman\\".Sawyer, Robert (2003). Victorian Appropriations of Shakespeare. Cranberry, NJ: Associated University Presses. p. 82. As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, especially Caged Bird and its immediate sequel Gather Together in My Name, are \\"very much concerned with what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it\\". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the \\"direct instruction of African American cultural forms\\".Lupton, p. 16. Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels \\"the central myth of black culture in America\\": that freedom and literacy are connected. Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including Edgar Allan Poe and William Shakespeare. Angelou states, early in Caged Bird, that she, as the Maya character, \\"met and fell in love with William Shakespeare\\".Angelou, p. 13. Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's \\"The Rape of Lucrece\\", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech. Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering.Vermillion, p. 69. Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape,Arensberg, p. 113. writing in Caged Bird, \\"...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust in the door and save me\\".Angelou, p. 78. According to Walker, the power of words is another theme that appears repeatedly in Caged Bird. For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words. Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again.Walker, p. 24. The importance of both the spoken and written word also appears repeatedly in Caged Bird and in all of Angelou's autobiographies. Referring to the importance of literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised Oprah Winfrey in a 1993 interview to \\"do as West Africans do ... listen to the deep talk\\", or the \\"utterances existing beneath the obvious\\".King, p. 215. McPherson says, \\"If there is one stable element in Angelou's youth it is [a] dependence upon books\\". The public library is a \\"quiet refuge\\" to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis. Hagen describes Angelou as a \\"natural story-teller\\", which \\"reflect[s] a good listener with a rich oral heritage\\". Hagen also insists that Angelou's years of muteness provided her with this skill. Angelou was also powerfully affected by slave narratives, spirituals, poetry, and other autobiographies.Lupton, p. 32. Angelou read through the Bible twice as a young child, and memorized many passages from it.Hagen, p. 19. African-American spirituality, as represented by Angelou's grandmother, has influenced all of Angelou's writings, in the activities of the church community she first experiences in Stamps, in the sermonizing, and in scripture.Hagen, p. 63. Hagen goes on to say that in addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In Caged Bird, Mrs. Flowers encourages her to listen carefully to \\"Mother Wit\\",Angelou, p. 83. which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African-American community as expressed in folklore and humor.Hagen, p. 28. Angelou's humor in Caged Bird and in all her autobiographies is drawn from Black folklore and is used to demonstrate that in spite of severe racism and oppression, Black people thrive and are, as Hagen states, \\"a community of song and laughter and courage\\".Hagen, p. 50. Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as she laughs at her flaws and the flaws of her community and \\"balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions\\". Hagen also characterize Caged Bird as a \\"blues genre autobiography\\"Hagen, p. 60. because it uses elements of blues music. These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Hagen also sees elements of African American sermonizing in Caged Bird. Angelou's use of African-American oral traditions creates a sense of community in her readers, and identifies those who belong to it.Hagen, p. 61. Reception and legacy =Critical reception and sales= I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is the most highly acclaimed of Angelou's autobiographies. The other volumes in her series of seven autobiographies are judged and compared to Caged Bird. It became a bestseller immediately after it was published. Angelou's friend and mentor, James Baldwin, maintained that her book \\"liberates the reader into life\\" and called it \\"a Biblical study of life in the midst of death\\". According to Angelou's biographers, \\"Readers, especially women, and in particular Black women, took the book to heart\\". upright By the end of 1969, critics had placed Angelou in the tradition of other Black autobiographers. Poet James Bertolino asserts that Caged Bird \\"is one of the essential books produced by our culture\\". He insists that \\"[w]e should all read it, especially our children\\".Bertolino, p. 199. It was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970, has never been out of print, and has been published in many languages. It has been a Book of the Month Club selection and an Ebony Book Club selection. In 2011, Time Magazine placed the book in its list of 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923. Critic Robert A. Gross called Caged Bird \\"a tour de force of language\\".McPherson, p. 23. Edmund Fuller insisted that Angelou's intellectual range and artistry were apparent in how she told her story. Caged Bird catapulted Angelou to international fame and critical acclaim, was a significant development in Black women's literature in that it \\"heralded the success of other now prominent writers\\".Baisn√©e, p. 56. Other reviewers have praised Angelou's use of language in the book, including critic E. M. Guiney, who reported that Caged Bird was \\"one of the best autobiographies of its kind that I have read\\". Critic R. A. Gross praised Angelou for her use of rich and dazzling images. By the mid-1980s, Caged Bird had gone through 20 hardback printings and 32 paperback printings.Hagen, p. 56 The week after Angelou recited her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration, sales of the paperback version of Caged Bird and her other works rose by 300‚Äì600 percent. Caged Bird had sold steadily since its publication, but it increased by 500 percent. The 16-page publication of \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" became a best-seller, and the recording of the poem was awarded a Grammy Award. The Bantam Books edition of Caged Bird was a bestseller for 36 weeks, and they had to reprint 400,000 copies of her books to meet demand. Random House, which published Angelou's hardcover books and the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, marking a 1,200 percent increase.Gillespie et al, p. 142. The book's reception has not been universally positive; for example, author Francine Prose considers its inclusion in the high school curriculum as partly responsible for the \\"dumbing down\\" of American society. Prose calls the book \\"manipulative melodrama\\", and considers Angelou's writing style an inferior example of poetic prose in memoir. She accuses Angelou of combining a dozen metaphors in one paragraph and for \\"obscuring ideas that could be expressed so much more simply and felicitously\\". Many parents throughout the U.S. have sought to ban the book from schools and libraries for being inappropriate for younger high school students, for promoting premarital sex, homosexuality, cohabitation, and pornography, and for not supporting traditional values. Parents have also objected to the book's use of profanity and to its graphic and violent depiction of rape and racism. =Influence= When Caged Bird was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African- American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. Up to that point, Black women writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called Caged Bird \\"a work of art that eludes description\\", has insisted that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for African-American autobiography as a whole. Als insisted that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as Als put it, \\"write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense\\". Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for blacks and women. Caged Bird made her \\"without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer\\". Although Als considers Caged Bird an important contribution to the increase of Black feminist writings in the 1970s, he attributes its success less to its originality than to \\"its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist\\" of its time, at the end of the American Civil Rights Movement. Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, freed many other women writers to \\"open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world\\". Angelou's autobiographies, especially the first volume, have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has used Caged Bird and Gather Together in My Name when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms. Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony causes readers of Angelou's autobiographies to wonder what she \\"left out\\" and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes. These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with \\"surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography\\". Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, analyzed the events in Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did.Challener, Daniel D. (1997). Stories of Resilience in Childhood. London, England: Taylor & Francis, pp. 22‚Äì23. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.Boyatzis, Chris J. (February 1992). \\"Let the Caged Bird Sing: Using Literature to Teach Developmental Psychology\\". Teaching of Psychology 19 (4): 221‚Äì222. =Censorship= Caged Bird has been criticized by many parents, causing it to be removed from school curricula and library shelves. The book was approved to be taught in public schools and was placed in public school libraries through the U.S. in the early-1980s, and was included in advanced placement and gifted student curricula, but attempts by parents to censor it began in 1983. It has been challenged in fifteen U.S. states. Educators have responded to these challenges by removing it from reading lists and libraries, by providing students with alternatives, and by requiring parental permission from students. Some have been critical of its sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent religious depictions.Foerstel, pp. 195‚Äì196. Caged Bird appeared third on the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990‚Äì2000, sixth on the ALA's 2000‚Äì2009 list, and one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms.Lupton, p. 5. =Film version= A made-for-TV movie version of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was filmed in Mississippi and aired on April 28, 1979, on CBS. Angelou and Leonora Thuna wrote the screenplay; the movie was directed by Fielder Cook. Constance Good played young Maya. Also appearing were actors Esther Rolle, Roger E. Mosley, Diahann Carroll, Ruby Dee, and Madge Sinclair. Two scenes in the movie differed from events described in the book. Angelou added a scene between Maya and Uncle Willie after the Joe Louis fight; in it, he expresses his feelings of redemption and hope after Louis defeats a white opponent.Lupton, p. 59. Angelou also presents her eighth grade graduation differently in the film. In the book, Henry Reed delivers the valedictory speech and leads the Black audience in the Negro national anthem. In the movie, Maya conducts these activities.Lupton, p. 64. Footnotes  Citations  Sources cited * Angelou, Maya (1969). I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.

The MLPN existed from 1968 to the early 1990s and was led throughout its existence by Pieter Boev√©, who used the pseudonym Chris Petersen. Boev√© joined the Dutch secret service in 1955 after attending 5th World Festival of Youth and Students in Warsaw. Prior to the MLPN's creation, he served as the international secretary of the Marxist-Leninist Centre of the Netherlands (MLCN), using his position to create contacts in China and Albania. He also started his own publication, De Kommunist, in 1966, against the wishes of his MLCN comrades. He was subsequently expelled from the party and formed his own League of Marxist-Leninists in the Netherlands (Liga van Marxisten-Leninisten in Nederland) in 1968. A year later, this party changed its name to the MLPN. The MLPN claimed to represent the principles of Maoism against the \\"heresies\\" of the official pro-USSR Communist Party of the Netherlands. It never had more than a dozen real members, none of whom were aware of its actual purpose. Notwithstanding this, Boev√© was able to cultivate many contacts within the Chinese government. He frequently received gifts and travelling expenses from the Chinese government and on one occasion was the guest of honour at a banquet presided over by Zhou Enlai. The BVD dissolved the MLPN shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when they judged that it was no longer necessary. Boev√© and another former BVD member went public with the true story of the party in 2004. Boev√© has claimed that he helped to facilitate the historic meeting of Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong in 1972. Prior to Nixon's decision to go to China, Boev√© was asked by his Chinese contacts as to his views on the possibility of better relations with the United States of America. He took this as a sign that the Chinese government was interested in improving relations between the two countries and passed his information on to the CIA. The MLPN published a monthly periodical called De Kommunist (The Communist). It was entirely written by BVD operatives. References  External links  * Jon Henley, \\"Mr Chips turns out to be 007.

In 2007, Pollok County Park was named Britain's Best Park, and in 2008 it was named the Best Park in Europe, beating competition from parks in Italy, France, Germany, Poland and Sweden. Despite this, by 2019 it was considered that the park was 'underused' with plans drawn up to encourage more visitors. History and features The park, through which the White Cart Water flows towards Paisley, is the largest within the city of Glasgow. It was originally part of the Old Pollok Estate, which was home to the Maxwell family for over 700 years.Pollok House, Old Country Houses of the Old Glasgow Gentry (1878) In 1966 Mrs Anne Maxwell Macdonald gifted the estate, including Pollok House, to Glasgow Corporation with the condition that it remained a public park.Pollok House (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection, Prints Collection), The Glasgow StoryPollok House (Glasgow University Library, Special Collections, Dougan Collection, 1870), The Glasgow Story In 1878 the Poloc Cricket Club was established.Our ground, Poloc Cricket club Their Shawholm ground is one of several sporting facilities which ring the core of the park, including public playing fields at Nether Pollok near ShawlandsNetherpollok Football Pavillion, The List (once containing the home ground of Pollok F.C. until 1926)The History of Pollok Football Club (1908-1977), Pollok FC and Norwood near Pollokshields,Location, Giffnock Soccer Centre the private fields of Police ScotlandLochinch History, Scottish Police recreation Association and Craigholme School,Craigholme School: Glasgow girls' school to close over dwindling pupil numbers, Evening Times, 28 February 2018 the rugby ground of Cartha Queens Park RFC, Dumbreck Riding SchoolFamily forced to close city riding school after 50 years, Evening Times, 26 August 2013 and two golf clubs: Haggs Castle (founded 1910) located next to the M77 motorwayClub History, Haggs Castle Golf Club and Pollok (1892)The Club, Pollok Golf Club to the north of Barrhead Road, a dual carriageway which is the only direct route between the east and west sides of the park approximately in length. On the other side of the road is a further golf club, Cowglen (1906).The Cowglen Golf Club, Cowglen Golf Club In 1954 the park also became home to Pollokshaws Bowling Club, the land donated by Sir John Maxwell Stirling-Maxwell of Pollok House; the club moved across Pollokshaws Road to celebrate its centenary. It is located near to Pollokshaws West railway station on the Glasgow South Western Line which is the nearest to the centre of the park and one of its entrances;Pollokshaws Bridges (Glasgow City Archives, Department of Architectural and Civic Design), The Glasgow Story on a different route (Cathcart Circle Lines) is also fairly close to one of the main entrances. The park also contains the Burrell Collection, a purpose-built building designed to hold the large, eclectic antique and art collection of shipping magnate William Burrell, who donated the collection to the City of Glasgow on his death. Another feature of interest is the award-winning fold of Highland cattle, which is the most accessible of this species for the majority of Scots. In 2004, three mountain biking routes were opened by Olympic cyclist Chris Hoy. Strathclyde Police's mounted and dog-handling divisions are based in the park. There are two allotment gardens, one near Haggs Castle Golf Club and one at Pollokshaws. Protests In the early 1990s the park was the site of a road protest camp, the \\"Pollok Free State\\", which attempted to prevent the M77 motorway from cutting through the south-west side of the park and separating it from the nearby housing schemes. The road cost ¬£53 million and destroyed 5,000 trees in a stretch of the park. Protesters, including local schoolchildren, attempted to prevent this using tactics such as building and occupying treehouses and tunnels. There was also a \\"Carhenge\\" of burnt-out and half-buried cars, from as far afield as Brighton, placed in the path of the road. Eviction of the camp by Wimpey bailiffs and police began on 23 March 1995, leading to 15 arrests and one injury. Though the camp failed to prevent the road being built, it was a formative experience for many Glasgow activists who had no previous experience of direct action. It also led to the resignation of M.P. Allan Stewart. As campaigners feared, the motorway has disconnected the park from communities to its north and west (Pollok, Corkerhill and Mosspark) with almost no direct access - there is one walkway on the north bank of the White Cart from near Corkerhill); by contrast, the eastern side of the park has three vehicular routes and two more access points for pedestrians and cyclists. In early 2008 a campaign to \\"Save Pollok Park\\" was formed, protesting against outdoor adventure company Go Ape; the company was invited by Glasgow City Council to enhance outdoor recreational activities within the park. Over five thousand residents objected to the proposals to site a high wire forest adventure in the ancient North Wood.Go Ape drops treetop park plans, BBC News, 13 June 2009Major transformation project for Pollok Country Park, Glasgow Live, 11 February 2019 References External links * *Pollok Country Park - Illustrated Guide at Scotcities *White Cart Walkway - Pollok Country Park at Scotcities *Friends of Pollok Country Park Country parks in Scotland Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Parks and commons in Glasgow Pollokshaws Pollokshields ","title":"Pollok Country Park"},{"id":"1219923","text":"SCMP may stand for: * South China Morning Post, Hong Kong newspaper * SCMP Group, former publisher of the South China Morning Post, now known as Great Wall Pan Asia Holdings * Simple Commerce Messaging Protocol * Software Configuration Management Plan * Stateless Certified Mail Protocol See also * Scump (born 1995), Seth Abner, professional Call of Duty player ","title":"SCMP (disambiguation)"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},H={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",H,[(t(!0),n(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(P,[["render",R]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/47.md","filePath":"sponsor/47.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/47.md"},F=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{D as __pageData,F as default};
